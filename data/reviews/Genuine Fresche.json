{"text":"I actually love this place, but customer service is so inconsistent, and the last two nights have been awful. I normally go in every week night after the gym at 8:30 pm. The last two nights, at 8:30 exactly I've walked in with the open sign off, employees sitting behind the register telling me they've closed down all the blenders and are closed. It just doesn't make sense to me, that a regular costumer with the same schedule can come in and get told they are closed early because the employees don't want to do the dishes. It sucks, I love the place but don't recommend it if you are going in anytime when they want to close 30/40 minutes early. This was at the Tempe location."}
{"text":"The bowls at thrive are pretty tasty, but the customer service leaves much to be desired. I have been on three separate occasions and have been greeted properly only once. However the other two times the same person was very unhelpful explaining the menu even after I said that it was my first time there. To me first impressions are everything and if you want someone to come back and buy what you are selling then you should make them feel appreciated or that you  like them spending their money at your place of  business."}
{"text":"So darn delicious!! If you haven't been here, you are missing out! I ordered the black berry walnut açai bowl. It was so"}
{"text":"I used to come here often, however,  The quality of acai bowls has gone down a lot. The last time I was in, the original acai bowl did not taste fresh. Very disappointed to see the staff did not care about my concern."}
{"text":"Grouponed here, great dessert and good service.

You will find the decor and seating a little basic, and the prices a little high.

However, they use high-quality ingredients, healthy stuff, and serve huge portions so it's not really that pricey from that perspective.  Check out their menu online first, since they have a lot of options."}
{"text":"How can a juice bar and smoothie place not open until 8AM, and be closed on Sunday?!   This is breakfast food, not lunch.  Good luck with surviving.  Great idea and excellent smoothies, however poor planning."}
{"text":"Best Acai bowl place around! They have great flavors and great staff, I was very happy with my visit!"}
{"text":"A little disappointed with the amount of fruit vs granola. More than half is granola. Other than that the flavors are great!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The sweetness of the acia paired with the texture and flavor of the granola are perfect. The flavors are interesting and delicious. My kids love to come here too. My favorite is strawberry passion. I also love the original, BlackBerry and tropical is a favorite."}
{"text":"Great bowls! I order the classic acai bowl and add coconut shavings to it. These bowls are tart and full of flavor. The only reason I am rating it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are SLOW!! Their staff needs more training. The register/ordering process is way too long and cumbersome. And the prep time of the bowls is the longest I've experienced at any acai/juice bar EVER!!! I even tried pre-ordering. I was told the 4 bowls I ordered would be 15/20 minutes. I arrived at the store 25 minutes later and still had to wait 10 minutes. 35 minutes, for 4 bowls!?!? Waaaaay too long. But, the bowls are delicious and the portions are generous. So, despite the long wait, I am still giving this place 4 stars. It deserves 5 stars based on flavor and quality, but the overall experience is time consuming and can be down right annoying. SO-- 4 stars is pretty impressive for such a clunky ordering/prep process. You know the bowls are good if a slow and annoying wait still gets 4 stars. The bowls DO NOT disappoint!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with Thrive! I've gone out to breakfast so many times here with friends. Much better option than pancakes if you're trying to eat healthy. Also I get a medium bowl and it completely fills me up! I like the Chocolate Coconut and Raspberry Pecan"}
{"text":"Great acai bowls - with gluten free granola on top. Excellent fresh pressed juices as well."}
{"text":"This is the perfect stop for a yummy, guilt-free meal with soooo many varieties and choices, I want to try them all but I definitely have favorites.  The add-ons make it that much healthier and they do punch cards!  The people are super friendly and phone orders make ordering on the go so easy."}
{"text":"Best acai bowls in the valley.   The portions are nice. And the flavor that we usually get is always consistent. No matter which location we buy them at, they all taste the same. We love eating here and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"This place is the closest I can get to an authentic California acai bowl. It may look like a little hole in the wall, and the customer service isn't all that great, but the acai bowls are amazingggg! There are so many options to choose from and the granola they use has a perfect crunch."}
{"text":"My husband & I love this place. We even opt for an acai bowl instead of a blizzard next door at Dairy Queen. I was a little hesitant at first trying something new but it was so worth it. It is basically a smoothie bowl topped with granola, fruit, & honey. A great way to start & end your day!"}
{"text":"Bad Customer Service
Me: I would like to buy a $6 smoothie with my groupon that is good for $10, will I be able to use the remaining $4 at a subsequent visit?
Employee #1: Yes, I think so.
Me: Ok, thank you
Me: My wife calls and asks me to buy something for her.
Me: I get back in line and then ask a new employee if I can buy a $5 bowl and use the removing portion of my groupon.
Employee #2: That is not how it works, your groupon can only be used once. 
Me: If I had known that I would have used the whole $10
Employee #2: Sorry, would you still like the bowl.
Me: No

I am disappointed that they did not offer to at least take 3 dollars off a bowl on a subsequent on the next purchase when they knew what had just happened and I was given false information by employee #1."}
{"text":"I really like these bowls. They have a large variety to choose from. Satisfies me like a meal would, plus tastes great. Only complaint is have is that the pineapple is usually frozen, and hurts my teeth, so I avoid the bowls with pineapple."}
{"text":"Way better than Nekter in my opinion. Thrive has a huge selection. @ Nekter the small size is the price of a large acai bowl at Thrive. Thrive has so many toppings and twice the menu selection. Many great options and the acai is actually flavorful, unlike Nekter."}
{"text":"Following our Rappel AZ experience we were looking for a snack after lunch... We were looking for a Jamba, and stumbled across thrive. Much Fresher, no sugar, and absolutely perfect fruit based dessert....  I would highly recommend frequenting here.."}
{"text":"Love!!  Original is where it's at.  I drive out of my way just to get one.  Tip:  phone it in so its ready when you get there."}
{"text":"One star because the bowls are delicious. Other than that this place is horrendous.  Slow as all hell, pretty much get your order wrong every single time. That's if they even remember to make it.  Usually you wait 15 minutes before finally saying something and they realize they forgot to make it in the first place.

Most unorganized operation ever.  If they didn't essentially have a monopoly on the Tempe Acai bowl market I'd never go here.  Their employees deserve less than minimum wage.  Oh and it's overpriced."}
{"text":"Love this place.. but I just went in and got the Strawberry bowl & keep getting small chunks of red rubber in every bite. Also only got maybe 5 strawberries in my bowl.. this might be a one time thing but I had a horrible experience here. Also took forever to come out and the man behind me (who also got an acai bowl) got his first."}
{"text":"The acai bowls are extremely delicious! They are a little pricey but that's simply because acai berries are a little pricey to begin with. The bowls are also huge and filling which makes it worth it! My only complaint is the employees. They lack serious customer service skills. They never EVER smile or say \"hello\" or \"goodbye\". When I arrive, they are usually in the back and they take a while to come out and take my order. They are all about college-aged and seem to hate their lives or are just bored out of their minds. Just wish that one of my favorite places  held a higher standard of customer service for their employees.
Also get better hours! I workout around 10 and they are not open then. They are also closed on Sunday which I such a bummer..."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have had different experiences each time. Once I came and there was some sort of meeting going on in the back. I have never been at a job where the business meetings were not in a private room and it was a little uncomfortable. Overall, the atmosphere of the workers is a little too laid back for me. Maybe a uniform of some sort would help. Food is good, I love the chocolate peanut butter bowl! However, it is VERY expensive for what you get. I got two smalls today and paid eleven dollars!! Even coming from an old Starbucks employee, I think it's very overpriced. Good food though!"}
{"text":"Thrive! has one of the best smoothies and acai bowls! \"Go Green\" its my favorite! They are not only healthy but also DELICIOUS! You should definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Best acai bowls.  Staff is friendly and knowledgable. They offered us samples before ordered. We ordered raspberry pecan and just acai. Both of them were awesome! We were really pleased and will be back again."}
{"text":"The kids and I tried this place for the first time.  We were excited to have a healthy smoothie alternative to Jamba close by.  My first thought walking in was that they didn't have the ingredients listed for the smoothies up on the menu board.  I found a paper menu but that didn't have them either.  I don't need a nutritional breakdown, but all the other smoothie places at least tell you what type of fruit, juice, if there's ice or yogurt, etc.  We asked about several smoothies and they listed the ingredients for us.  We chose our three and then waited.  And waited.  And waited.  I found it strange that they make their smoothies in the back room where you can't see them.  I like how Jamba, Inta Juice, Juice it Up, and most other smoothie shops all make theirs out front so you can see the ingredients and the progress.  There was no one ahead of us in line so it was strange that it took so long.  After 10-15 minutes, they brought them out.

We left and as we all started drinking them, the taste was okay.  I've had many acai smoothies from different places and made them at home and I noticed that the distinct acai flavor was not there.  But since I had a green smoothie, I figured it might have been the veggies disguising it.  But I couldn't really taste those either.  I did however taste LOTS of banana.  They did not list banana when we asked them about the smoothies so I was not happy about that since I don't like banana and would have left that out.  We were already about 10 minutes into our next errand by the time I asked the kids about theirs.  They both said they tasted like banana rather than the flavor they ordered and sure enough, it was a mild fruit flavor with lots of banana taste.  We weren't told about the banana in the kids' smoothies either.  It actually made me wonder what else they added that they didn't tell me about.

I drank mine and the kids drank most of theirs, mostly because we were hungry and paid so much for them.  My large which was smaller than the medium at all the other smoothie places, was $8 and the kids mediums which might be the same as a small (16 oz) at other smoothie places were almost $6 each.  

We wanted to love this place because we are fans of healthy smoothies and frequent many different smoothies shops around Arizona and California but between the cost, the slow service, and the just-okay taste, we probably won't be back.  I'm sure the acai bowls are good but looking at the high cost for the sizes they offer, it's probably not going to bring us back in.  Sorry Thrive.  Great concept but not so great execution."}
{"text":"The acai and pitaya bowls are so good but every single time I have come the service is TERRIBLE. Does it really take 30minutes to make something that requires no heat? Also, everyone who works here look pretty much miserable. Smile! This job can't be that hard and I'm sure employees get a discount on their bowls... Sometimes I wonder why I keep coming back. Called in a to-go order at 9:45, said it would be 15minutes...It's almost 10:15 and still my order isn't ready. I can see them making bowls through the window and it doesn't look like they have even started any to-go order. Please work on your service!!!"}
{"text":"This place makes absolutely delicious acai bowls!  I loved going there, but I won't anymore due to my last two experiences.  I have an allergy to walnuts, and an even more severe allergy to peanuts. A few weeks ago I ordered the chocolate coconut bowl asking to make sure there weren't either peanuts or walnuts in it.  They said there wasn't so I took the bowl home only to find it completely topped with walnuts.  Unfortunately I had to throw it away but I understood mistakes happen.  This past Friday though, I ordered four chocolate coconut bowls (not all for me!), again making sure there were not peanuts or walnuts.  I opened one up in the parking lot to immediately make sure there were no walnuts on it (almonds and coconut are the loves of my life!) and ate one of them.  Immediately, my throat closed up, my face turned purple, and I broke out in hives.  I had to use my epi pen and headed to the hospital.  My boyfriend called to ask them about the bowls and they said they didn't use any peanuts, but my allergic reaction I had was to peanuts.  I hadn't eaten anything else that day and had the chocolate coconut bowl many times before.  I am not sure what happened, but somehow peanuts or peanut butter ended up in my bowl.  The place is awesome and the people are so nice, but food allergies are no joke so I won't be going back.  If you don't have any allergies though the place is great!"}
{"text":"This is literally my favorite place to eat in all of Arizona! The bowls and smoothies are awesome, and the staff is great! I come here probably twice a week for lunch or post workout. I love them all, and usually get the oatmeal on the bottom of the bowl, so delicious! Great for anyone with gluten or dairy allergies too! Just ask for gluten free granola if thats what you need!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of delicious healthy treats without the guilt and much to my surprise Thrive delivers. I was pleased to see that their menu has quite a variety of bowls, shakes and smoothies.  I just wish we didn't have to drive so far for these yummy treats. Hoping to see a Thrive open up on the west side by West Gate."}
{"text":"We showed up at 8:56pm and they close at 9pm... They were very nice and still served us.  It was a great late night treat. The employees were really nice and did not make it a big deal when we ordered just before closing.  It's something I would recommend nothing to compare it too.  Really good healthy treat."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in for a sample and were blown away with how delicious, fresh and healthy these bowls are. We are heading there tonight for a first time, full helping of a bowl. I love the fact that they use pea protein and whole ingredients. They also offer gluten free granola as a topping and all their bowls are naturally dairy free. This will definitely be my frozen-yogurt replacement!"}
{"text":"I love all the food here. I go here quite often. It is a bit expensive. But I'm ok with that. I'm only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the staff isn't very personable or nice to me. Other reviews say otherwise but every time I go in they seem unhappy and irritated. It won't stop me from going, I just wish they would seem to enjoy their job a little bit more."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed coming here. The acai bowls are so light and refreshing and yet satisfying. Perfect for the hot summer days. You can taste the quality ingredients and the effort put into each bowl. Deliciously done, Thrive!"}
{"text":"I love this place - I have yet to be disappointed. They offer a huge variety of acai bowls. If I could find something to complain about it would be the service. Everyone is super friendly, but are very slow."}
{"text":"A girlfriend brought me here for an Acai bowl... I had no idea what to expect! I got the original Acai bowl and loved it! It was so refreshing, I wanted another one immediately. The location isn't very close to me so I hope they open more locations soon!"}
{"text":"This place sucked. It was slow, they messed up our order and the people inside were rude. We went trying to get a FAST healthy lunch and ended up with a slow, gross smoothie. Over charged us by $2.00. It may be healthy but it's not worth the wait or the cost. $13 for two smoothies was ridiculous. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The bowls are unique as well as the smoothies. They have a great variety. The staff is helpful and place is upbeat. The only thing I would leave out is the whey or pea protein. I don't know what kind they use but it gives everything a funky taste. Would recommend and would go again."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to grab a quick smoothie before grocery shopping at Sprouts and we had the WORST customer service we have ever experienced. Him and I both have experience in the food & beverage industry and would have NEVER treated customers in the disrespectful way we were treated. We ordered smoothie and after almost 20 minutes of waiting two \"bowls\" we're given to us. When we explained that we had ordered smoothies and not bowls the guy who took our order argued with us. It was rude, disrespectful and we will ensure to tell everyone we know to NEVER go there."}
{"text":"I'm going to preface this review with the understanding that they serve some amazingly delicious bowls that are a healthier choice to fast food.

Visiting my first time on a weekend, the place was very busy. So much so I waited over 30 minutes for my order. I wish the staff would have informed me of the wait time. I also noticed some people coming in with no shoes on, which I thought was a health violation. 

Visited again this morning. Not a lot of people, but those that were there ordered a lotta food. Again, wait time was rather long especially when I was in a bit of a rush. 

Definitely love the food and I will be back, but they need to streamline their work and Inform customers about wait times. I just need to figure out times when they're not so backed up."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. It always takes a long time but today was at least 30 minutes waiting while employees texted in the back.  Once we got our acai bowls they were very skimpy. My wife's a regular but I think after tonight we're calling it."}
{"text":"This place and the food is great.  It may not be perfect, but I enjoy the concept and that these people are trying to do something hats very cool.  I ordered an original medium bowl and walked out very full.  It was only 300 calories!  Great for us who are dieting a little.."}
{"text":"First of all, I just want to say that Thrive has the best acai bowls around!!! My favorite is the original and the tropical! I love how they have so many add-ins you can choose from. Sometimes it can get pretty busy, especially around lunch time, so if I'm in a hurry, you can always call your order in ahead of time and it will be ready for you to come pick it up! A lot of people have commented that it can be a little pricey, but when you consider the fact that they use all fresh fruit and ingredients, what else do you expect? You get what you pay for and this isn't McDonalds people! Also, the bowls are huge and a small fills me up every time! I love finding a place that has good food that I can feel good about eating, and the employees are always so nice and willing to make things right if they make a mistake. I just wish that there was a location closer to my house, or I'd be here every day!"}
{"text":"The Acai bowls here are absolutely delicious- the healthy part is a big plus! I'm usually more of a carnivore, but the bowls here taste great. It can take some time to make the bowls, so I would always recommend calling ahead on your way in. The flavors are all excellent, and I'm a big fan of the original, go green, and peanut butter (my favorite) flavors.

If you haven't tried one yet, you should give it a chance!"}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy. Staff is very flexible to prepare Acai bowl just the way you want it.  A weekly stop for family."}
{"text":"I love this place! My friends and I frequent here about once a week for the past few months. I have tried about half of the bowls on the menu and have gotten stuck on the passion fruit one. The service is good and the people are friendly. 

I absolutely recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"This is a little out of the way for me, but well worth the drive.  I had the chocolate peanut butter acai bowl and the bf had the coconut chocolate acai bowl.  Both were REALLY good.  The only problem I have with acai bowls is I know they are loaded with sugar and the World Health Organization recommends that adults have only 25-26 grams of sugar a day.  That's not whole heck of a lot and if you are still drinking sugared soda, you've exceeded that by far in one serving and that is probably the same with the acai bowl.  So I would say that as an occasional treat try the the acai bowls at Fresche because they are yummy.   Now something new that I discovered at Fresche are Quest Protein Chips.  What's great about these chips is that they offer 21 grams of protein, 120 calories and 0 grams of sugar per bag.  We tried the salt and vinegar and BBQ chips.  I thought the salt and vinegar chips were a bit too  vinegary for my liking but the BBQ chips were pretty good.  Let me be clear -- these chips do not taste like regular chips and because of that they have a much lower \"scarfability\" factor than regular chips -- this is a good thing because you won't be inclined to eat a bunch of bags all at once, gain a bunch of weight (or think you've just gained a bunch of weight) and hate yourself -- y'all know what I am talking about.:).  Plus they aren't cheap - I bought 2 bags for $5.  I wish the ingredients were vegan; they are soy and gluten free however.  Nice find when you are in a pinch and need protein."}
{"text":"Yum! The bowls are so good. My understanding is that they're dairy free and you can get gluten free granola!"}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times and so far Every bowl Ive had is delicious Blackberry is my fav so far. Also staff seems pretty friendly,Only reason it's not four stars is I happen to come in one night and one of the gentleman working in the back keep grab at his nose as if he needed to blow it. This honestly grossed me out and being I've worked in the food industry I know you should not be going from touching your nostril repeatedly and preparing food"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! I love that they have gluten free granola! My fav is the cherry bowl. I wish they would get the previous to go covers for the bowls because all of the honey sticks to the lid /: But other then that the staff is great, bowls are yummy, and protein shakes a little chalky but good (:"}
{"text":"I met a friend here for the first time. I ordered the Chocolate Coconut Blend Bowl. It was amazing! Every bite was delicious. I will definitely want to return for a refreshing treat or meal here. Friendly staff, and it seemed to be quite popular during the time frame I was there. Highly recommend this place for something healthy and delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times now and I love the acai bowls, they are a lot of food, and well put together with great ingredients...This visit was a different experience relating to customer service... Not only were there only 2 people working and the place was packed, but a large group of people that ordered after me got their bowls before mine came out, and then the employee had to ask me what I ordered. :( not happy... She may have sensed my irritation, but a few minutes later she came back with my bowl and handed me a discount card for next time...  And just like that, angry customer pleased again... well done Fresche, I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Great bowls and great service! They occasionally email me coupons too and their portions are a good size."}
{"text":"Smoothie was good and priced appropriately.  Environment could be a little it more cleaner and put together."}
{"text":"First time here as my friends rave about how awesome and fresh it is. What they neglected to tell me was to pre-order only as the wait time was 40 mins for two small smoothies. I hope they get appropriate staffing in the weekends or I won't be back."}
{"text":"Go here! Get yourself an acai bowl. Thank me later!


Great service! Good prices (cheaper than most places in the valley)."}
{"text":"I don't know if we just hit this place on the wrong day but since there was NOBODY else in there, I tend to think we didn't. I haven't been to a place in a long time that had such extremely poor customer service and I mean BAD!  We only ordered two smoothies and a mini acai bowl. After waiting nearly 20 min. the two ladies walk out with one smoothie and the acai bowl and one immediately tells me that it took so long because they had a HUUUUGE call in order and suggests next time if I don't want to wait that I call my order in; are you kidding me, since when does a customer that is in your store ready to order and pay take a lower priority over a called in order?  After her spiel about the length of time, I explain to her that we are missing a smoothie. With no apology she very defensively tells me that not only did I not order the other smoothie but, I didn't pay for the other smoothie and that she can show me the receipt to prove it; WHOA!!!!! A simple sorry I didn't hear that part of your order would you like me to make that now would have been fine, instead she has an attitude like I am trying to rip her off. All I know is we were first and last time customers and I will tell everybody about our horrible experience there.  The food may be healthy but the attitudes of the employees (and I sure hope they weren't the owners) need a good spiritual cleansing!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cute. I've only ever tried the raspberry lime acai bowl, but I get it every time because it's the perfect combination of sweet and tart. The sizes are fair for the price. I usually get a small and its filling. They have a good variety of acai bowls, smoothies, and juices. They also sell protein bars and stuff like that. Definitely one of my favorite spots in the area."}
{"text":"Truly the best Acai bowls ever! 
We frequently at least 2 times a week. 
Not the greatest location. 
And it is far for us. But overall it's the greatest flavor"}
{"text":"It is good for what it is.  Healthy ingredients, costly, mediocre service is all to be expected based on reviews (and my experience).  What is not so obvious is the amount of sugar and carbs that are in the bowls.  The medium Original has around 53g of sugar, for example.  That is way too much!!  It left me zonked out during kickboxing at the martial arts studio next door (Fluid Martial arts, check it out, awesome!).   Not surprising that this is not listed on the website.  There is a sheet of nutritional value that you can see at the counter, but most people go in thinking it is a sinless treat.  But you won't lose much weight eating this much sugar and carbs!  If there is any way to cut the sugar down (best I could see was 42g in the medium Chocolate Peanut butter), I would love to go back and indulge some more.  In the meantime, I will have to pass for something truly healthy."}
{"text":"I loved this place when I first discovered it, I have brought my friends and family here several times. I've filled a total of 3 punch cards over the past 4 months of discovering this place. However cut to 1/8/2016 I called and ordered 2 bowls (because they take forever to make them) for pick up and requested a small amount of granola. Upon picking them up I realized they actually put a heaping amount of granola which made it hard to enjoy, secondly the two bowls that I ordered Tropical and the Go green made me and my sister both nauseous, light headed and dizzy while we were eating them and after. This was all we had ate since breakfast, so it wasn't anything else. I called to inquire if anyone else had experienced this feeling and the person who answered wasn't even paying attention to the call, he was talking to someone else. The feeling that we both felt which has slowly subsided isn't \"Natural\". I will not be eating here ever again sadly."}
{"text":"I was excited about this place because I am a huge acai fan. So, I go in (15 min ago) and there are 3 high school kids working there, 2 on laptops and 1 behind the counter. I wasn't greeted when entering and when I ordered the kids got up from their laptops without washing there hands or putting on gloves and made my acai bowl. Had I not paid I would have walked out. I can't tell you if the food was good because I threw it away. Thanks for the wasted $7. I would have prob came in a few times a week."}
{"text":"how do you give zero stars? Used to love this place but the service has gone down hill. Asked employee to clean the dirty tables and said, \"Oh, uh, we've been so busy today\" but there was no one in the place. Then the acai bowl was 1/3 of its normal size and we asked the employee said, \"Our owner said we've been putting too much in it\". They tried to hide the little amount of acai with bananas."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING!! So good and so healthy! The service was fast and the workers were unbelievable friendly! This is my new favorite place in Chandler! Try the peach passion pitaya!"}
{"text":"The customer service at this location is outstanding!!! When I went in earlier this week I was greeted by two young girls -- Madison & Tara -- they were super sweet & helped me pick out which bowl to get! 
I would definitely recommended this place to ANYONE!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the peanut butter bowl! And I don't even feel guilty about indulging :)"}
{"text":"Yummy! My wife loves this place. I think it's a good snack. I'd probably get the free oatmeal next time to make it better."}
{"text":"I have loved everything Ive gotten from here. Delicious acai bowls (peanut butter is my favorite) that you can customize to fit your diet. They are always friendly and and helpful when ordering. Cost is on the high side but they do offer frequent deals if you follow on Instagram and other social media. Also if it's busy the wait time can be a little long."}
{"text":"Now called Genuine Fresche, it looks like they've expanded their offerings. Yay!

This morning, I went in and got a Go Green bowl. While I was there, the employees were preparing a massive order (20 or so bowls). A guy stormed out after complaining about how long he was waiting to get his order, even though the girl at the front patiently explained that they had a couple of huge orders. While I think the customer in question was kind of a drama queen about the wait, it would have been smart for the employees to warn him beforehand. Otherwise, the employees were really friendly.

I wasn't in a rush, and I got my bowl in a reasonable time-- about 10 minutes. It was awesome. I would definitely return to Genuine Fresche if I'm ever hungry and in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Came by for a berry smoothy. It was absolutely flavorless.  Had tried them in the past and we're good. Employee behind the counter seemed to not care about my dissatisfaction.  I then proceeded to leave and realized for the money I just spent I better get something that I enjoy. They ended up making a new one different flavor.  Will give them the benefit  of the doubt.  Yet customer service has to be forefront,  and not talking to your friends."}
{"text":"Love this place...  Girl at the register should be a lot more personable. Great environment & food though."}
{"text":"Love the acai sorbet they serve with their bowls. They use fresh fruits and other  ingredients. I recommend this place for a meal or desert."}
{"text":"The food itself is great but it is the slowest service ever. Usually takes my entire lunch hour just to get an Acai bowl."}
{"text":"Delicious reasonably priced acai bowls. The storefront is small but clean and well organized.  I had the chocolate peanut butter bowl and my daughter had the cherry walnut.  Both were amazing. The fruit was super fresh and the serving size for the price was perfect. Definitely will become a regular stop for us in the future."}
{"text":"Really good açaí bowls  Such fair prices in comparison to other smoothie places around! Nice to have healthy food nearby. They have a food truck too :)"}
{"text":"$8-9 for a large (16-18oz?) smoothie... Even with real fruit and juices is ludicrously expensive. Took quite a while for the smoothie to be made too so I sat and waited. Furniture is filthy and stained. Not sure of a better option but this isn't even a last resort."}
{"text":"Acai Bowl I think I love you! Yes this place offers amazing açaí bowls that are just as good (if not better) than what I had in Hawaii's North Shore.  

Their small size is enough for a grown man! Several options on the menu but I like the \"just açaí\" or the dragon fruit (Pitaya).  Those are the natural and what put these bad boys on the foodie map in the first place.  

Other options are very sweetened with chocolate and syrups and not for me, but to each his own.  I saw a lot of customers in there ordering and luvin' it with all varieties. 

Very friendly and they offer a rewards program for locals."}
{"text":"Zero stars for customer service. They actually blamed me for their bad service saying \"I'm sorry you felt you had bad service\". Umm...cut the non-apology apology gaslighting and learn some integrity.  You are running a business. Act like it."}
{"text":"The best acai bowl I have ever eaten was at Protea Cafe in Hawaii. Of course, when you live in AZ... going to the Protea Cafe in HI is obviously not an option except for maybe once a year. Thrive is my local Protea Cafe. This place is great. The acai bowls are awesome and I love the different flavours they offer. Lets be honest, making your own acai bowl is not always ideal. All the ingredients you need make it expensive to make on your own and you'll land up not even enjoying it. Thrive offers great bowls at an even better price! If I could, I would eat here for lunch every. single. day. Just a fair warning... it will take a good 10 minutes for you to get your bowl, but well worth the wait! Plus I never mind when places take some time to make my meal because that means they're only making it when I order it! My mom is on her way right now to grab us some bowls. Try it... you won't be disappointed! :)"}
{"text":"I honestly feel like my wait time for this place is a sick joke. Ordered a green smoothie & it took me 45 minutes to receive it. I understand and appreciate that you make everything fresh, however, you should warn your customers BEFORE purchase if it's going to take that long. Please be respectful of your customers time or hire more staff. I will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Thrive Acai (thank you Groupon!) on our way to the Sprouts next door. I got the Chocolate Coconut Bowl and the bf got the Chocolate Cherry. They were both great, though I liked mine a bit better since it had pea protein, which gave it a smooth yummy texture. The ladies at the counter were knowledgeable and helpful, even though we came in about 10 minutes before closing. 
Took off one star due to the bowl taking a little long to make, and the whole place smelling really strongly like the nail salon next door. They mentioned something about fixing the ventilation soon. I hope so, I plan to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Over-Hyped. They offer vegan options and everything is natural but the taste is nothing out if this world and the wait time is a bit ridiculous. Not something I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Great smoothies, extensive choices, relaxing ambiance and sizeable portions at great prices."}
{"text":"I love Thrive. It's always clean inside, the staff is always friendly, and the acai bowls are consistently amazing! It is pricey though,  which is the only downfall."}
{"text":"I hate to be yet another person giving a bad review because of the sanitation practices that go on here. The employees need to wash their hands. Everyone working was wearing gloves but no one actually washed their hands before putting on the gloves. A girl took my order and then proceeded to go back and make my order without washing  her hand. Think about it she entered my order on the tablet ( every person that uses a card to pay touches that screen). The red head guy (that has been mentioned in other reviews) answered the phone and then went back and continued to make food without washing his hands. Don't employees that work with food have to complete food handling training? I also would like to see hair net being used. I would hope that the owners would do something about this with the number of bad reviews. I will not come back to this location as I do not want to get sick from lack of hand hygiene."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience the last two times I came here. Both were at the Tempe location. The first I got a bowl that tasted really weird, but they gave me a new bowl no charge so that turned out okay. The second time I asked about pieces of chocolate in a bowl that I noticed the last time I was there. The chocolate pieces weren't there before (or I probs didn't notice them) so I asked if they were vegan. There's dairy-free vegan chocolate, but not all chocolate is vegan so you just have to ask to check if it is. I had been told the bowl I had been ordering this whole time was vegan except for the honey, but then the woman at the counter said the chocolate pieces could have milk in them? Not sure if she double checked or if it actually does. And I was told up until then that for sure it was just the honey in the bowl that was not vegan. I didn't want to chance it so I asked if I could just replace the chocolate shavings with another topping. They wouldn't replace the chocolate shavings with another topping without charging extra. And I already order the bowl sans honey, no swapped ingredients for that either. I'm not sure why something as small as chocolate shaving was the last straw because I've paid extra for other things that were a bigger deal (like paying full price for a cheese pizza with no cheese), but I've been pretty tired of feeling gipped because I have to remove toppings/ingredients to make a dish vegan and then I still pay full price (or sometimes extra, in this case they charged extra to replace the ingredient but sometimes they want me to pay extra to just take out an ingredient). The bowls are made fresh so it's not like there's premade mix and they would have to go out of the way to swap ingredients. The nice thing is I don't have to do this anymore because so many already marked vegan options or all vegan restaurants are popping up. I ended up not ordering anything and leaving. So even though I've been coming here for over 4 years now, going to have to say bye to Genuine Fresche, after these two experiences just don't want to come here anymore."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite acai bowl place in the Phoenix area. Love their chocolate walnut bowl and this one doesn't have honey on it so it's already vegan. It must be the chocolate pea protein powder because these bowls are so filling. I like that they are creamy instead of juice consistency like most places. They don't taste sugared down and watery. All the bowls have lots of topping options like walnuts, chocolate shavings, and coconut and different add-ons. Their peanut butter and chocolate walnut are my favorite bowls. You go up to the counter to order and it usually takes a while to get your food. It's a pretty casual set up, a lot of people grab food after a work out. They also have a virtual star points system. Each time you get a bowl they track how many bowls you've bought. After 10-12 bowls you get a free bowl. I think you have to sign up once and after that it tracks you, but there is no physical punch card so you have to make sure you are in the system."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a green smoothie with added vitamin C and probiotics to help me fight off this summer cold.  I feel better already!  Service was fast and friendly.  Cool place!  I look forward to trying more items on their menu."}
{"text":"Looove their bowls! Better than any other kind i've tasted.  I usually always go for the original, but the chocolate coconut is great too. Sweet staff!"}
{"text":"Hubby brought this back for me for breakfast one morning on a recent trip to AZ. I only have my local Vitality Bowls to compare this to, but this was good. I didn't go to the store, so can't comment on that, but hubby called me to ask if I wanted Small, Medium, Large, or Extra Large bowl and I asked for medium telling him I wanted something equivalent to the Small here at Vitality Bowls. The medium from this place was even smaller and more expensive, so they lose a star for that. However, the acai base was more flavorful than the local joint here, so score on that! I love acai bowls so this place is a great place to get healthy food and I will go back again when in the area."}
{"text":"I walked in with only one person in front of me in line. Everyone else in the place already had their order. The service was SO slow. I literally waited 25 minutes for one small original bowl. It was delicious but not worth waiting almost a half hour."}
{"text":"LOVE ME SOME ACAI! 

Thrive has got a great little store front with catchy slogans and what not. The menu is awesome and I definitely suggest the green bowl. 

I'm not sure how I feel about the set up with the kitchen in the back and all but I'll forgive them for taking so long on an acai bowl because it was really really good. 

I may try the gluten free granola next time because whatever they use regularly is quite light and crunchy. I also think they should potentially get vita-mix's or industrial type blenders rather than the little bullets I saw them using. I had a huge chunk of acai  on the bottom of my bowl & it just seems like blenders would be more useful honestly."}
{"text":"I have tried the bowl for a few times and i love it. New way to eat healthy. I like how they decorate the shop, very unique. My baby love to share a bowl with me too."}
{"text":"The first thing I thought when I heard about this place is finally a place near campus that is actually fresh and healthy.  Unfortunately the customer service is awful. It is a tiny awkward store front.  Not somewhere I would sit down with friends like you would at a yogurt shop.  There are literally 3 tables and not even a menu posted on the wall.  There were literally 3 people working and they took forever to fill an order of 2 items.  Its a great idea and the product is good but with bad service, lack of menu on the wall, and terribly slow service I dont think it will be around for long."}
{"text":"Ok... Let's be honest, it's a desert. If you're like my fiance, then you think that because it has 3 leaves of spinach and some acai in it, then it's a \"healthy meal\"... I disagree. It may be naturally occurring sugar but it's got lots of it. Topped with honey and granola. Yum, yes. Healthy, debatable.

Also, the prices are way too high, and the wait was ridiculous. I really thought it was delicious (Go Green Bowl) but I don't think I'll pay or wait for it again. Sorry! Not super impressed."}
{"text":"Good product. Nice people but terribly slow. Should have just walked out and stopped waiting. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I've been to Thrive twice now, ordered a bowl the first time & a protein smoothie the other. The bowl was alright / pretty good. I liked the smoothie-like consistency & taste of the blend at the bottom of the bowl but didn't care much for the granola & fruit which is why I got the protein smoothie the next time. I wasn't a huge fan of the after taste. I like the concept of this place, however, so I'll probably go back. I'd like to try one the regular smoothies to see how that stacks up!"}
{"text":"I think it's ridiculously rude when a customer walks in & the person at the cash register is on their phone. This is exactly what happened when I walked in during lunch time today. After I had ordered, she went back to being on her phone. Absolutely distasteful customer service.

My Chocolate Peanut Butter bowl came out quickly. I had asked for it to go, which in hindsight I wish I hadn't as it was not all that great ... especially not for almost $9! I was absolutely appalled. I've enjoyed many acai bowls in the past & this one didn't stack up anywhere close to them. The only things good in the bowl were the toppings. The fruit (strawberries & banana) were over-ripe but the granola, almonds, and honey tasted good. So really the way I see it, I paid $9 for a handful of granola, a sprinkle of almonds, and a honey drizzle. Great. As far as the actual mixture goes, it had an odd taste, most likely because of the chocolate protein powder, and was way too liquid-y. I haven't ever had protein powder before and if this was a representation of what it tastes like then I will definitely be staying away. The mixture being too liquid-y was just a complete turn off.

For the amount of money & quality, I recommend not giving this place a try. I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I am an acai bowl addict! I went to the original chop shop in chandler for their acai bowls until I found that thrive was closer to my work and home. First of all, it is expensive. I have tried acai bowls everywhere including out of state and I never felt like they were over priced the way they are at thrive. I was able to get a big sized bowl at chop shop for around $6 and at thrive it's about $9+. I've visited this location more than 5 times and it's really nothing special, I just keep returning because I need my acai fix. My first visit was absolutely chaotic. There were tons of people waiting at 2 in the afternoon and I was told it would be a 30 minute wait to get mine to go. Seriously? The staff is run by high school age kids, which is fine, but they definitely lack the leadership and management skills. Every time I've visited there isn't an employee at the front counter to take orders. They make everything in the back which is behind a closed door with a small window at the top of the door I believe, where I doubt you could see if customers were coming in. There's been countless occasions where I've been standing there waiting for someone to come out and take my order. Whenever the door opens I've seen numerous employees, usually 4 at a time. It makes me wonder what they're doing back there and how hard it can really be to make acai bowls and smoothies. At Jamba Juice you're lucky if you have two employees working at a time and they get your order to you in less than 5 minutes. I highly suggest hiring and training a manager to be on staff at all times that are able to understand what running a business should look like. I've never had an issue with the employees being rude, just nothing special. Again, just very frustrating when you have to wait so long and aren't getting good customer service. If you plan on trying them out, make sure you give yourself the same amount of time you would as a fancy dining restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite clean place to go after the gym for a post workout treat. I love to get the Pitaya Colada Bowl and the Strawberry Passion Acai Bowl. It's very healthy and the portion is good. Great customer service and they have a punch card too which is nice. Buy 10 get 1 medium free. They also sale protein powder."}
{"text":"I've always loved the Fresche on Southern. I've only been to this one twice, and both times they are so skimpy with the berries. I haven't been to the Southern location in a while..but for the price I hope it's not gotten skimpy too!! Please don't be so stingy Fresche"}
{"text":"Today we tried the original acai bowl and topped it with coconut-tasty but I truly favor the chocolate walnut bowl!!!"}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love!! This place is awesome. I have tasted acai before but I didn't love it... but these bowls? They are deelish and so fresh tasting, likes a wonderful desert, yet healthy. I would recommend it to everyone, not just health nuts."}
{"text":"What a great place! Great environment, service and acai bowls!! I recommend this to anyone looking to fill their belly with something healthy.  Get the strawberry passion bowl! Yum!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for three years now! About time I wrote a review :)
The staff is super friendly. They are willing to help you find the best flavor for you when you are not sure. If you're lucky, you can watch them make the peanut butter FRESH there in the giant window they have to the side. I love that I can talk on the phone while waiting for my bowl unlike at Jamba Juice where it gets too loud. 
I recommend Cherry Walnut for breakfast
Original for a snack (this is my go-to all the time though!)
Chocolate coconut for a meal replacement! Their chocolate bowls are made with a chocolate pea protein, so it's not syrup crap. 

I'm not sure if I made it clear... but I LOVE Thrive!"}
{"text":"Love love love.... they even offer Raw cacao nibs as a topping instead of chocolate chips and they also offer an açai that has no added sugar in it if you ask for it."}
{"text":"Original Acai Bowl for the win. Showed up at 930 on a Wednesday. No line and 3 workers available. Service was fast (obviously) and bowl was good. Try this place for some good fresh eats"}
{"text":"Having the pitaya (dragon fruit) colada! Pineapple and coconut with granola and beautiful bright fuchsia sorbet, so good!! 

Trying to eat just a little of it though, can be a problem. I usually just want to eat the entire thing in one sitting. 

Love the new location and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My son took me there today and I had the original and it was very good. I'm sure I'll go there again."}
{"text":"I came in here yesterday night and ordered a smoothie, acai bowl, and 2 orange sunrise juices. I came back today to get another juice for myself and my mom because it was so delicious! The drinks do take some time to get out but I can understand that if they're juicing all ingredients and cutting all fruit made to order. 
One suggestion I have is that the chairs and tables needed to be pushed in and wiped down regularly. And if they use organic fruits and vegetables that should be advertised as it could be a great selling point for the shop!
I'm really glad to find a juice shop so close to home, and I wish the best for this mom & pop shop!"}
{"text":"Out running errands on my lunch break, I was looking for a quick light lunch before heading back to work and found this place on Yelp and decided to swing by for a smoothie.

Since I have an allergy to bananas, I ordered the 16 oz. pitaya colada smoothie (the only one without bananas) and added whey powder to give it a little protein. It was a striking magenta color thanks to the pitaya and definitely tasty ... though of course with it's piña colada-esque flavor I couldn't help thinking \"this would be AMAZING with a little rum...\"

The staff didn't seem very friendly, but not horribly unfriendly either, moreso just apathetic; other Yelpers seem to have different experiences so I'd give it another shot. The main downside though is that it came out to around $9 total, which is a bit expensive for a smoothie. I'm also disappointed that their menu states they have an upcharge for any substitutions--a real bummer for those of us with allergies. Overall, though, I'm glad to have a smoothie/juice place close to work again (since this same location used to be a Jamba Juice)."}
{"text":"I'm an acai convert! My gym and work are right next to Thrive, but I never considered eating there until I saw some rave reviews from fellow Yelpers. I'm so thankful I tried Thrive out because it's a wonderful work lunch option for me.

Yes, the bowls might seem expensive for $8-10 each, but I stay full for at least 4 hours after eating one. I usually get a medium with one or two extra toppings like cacao nibs or goji berries.  The granola they use is very good, and I love how it pairs with the tart acai base. The chocolate walnut bowl is my favorite, but I plan on trying them all.

Service has been friendly and quick. One young woman was even conscientious enough to follow me outside to make sure my order was correct (it was).

 The only thing I haven't been happy with is the use of frozen fruit (e.g. pineapple, cherries). I'd rather those bowls be taken off the menu if the fresh fruit isn't available.

I'd also like it if the nutrition information available at the counter was also posted on the website. I'm sure many people would find that useful."}
{"text":"I love the bowls! But this is a review on customer service. Please tell me why it took 20 minutes to make a to go Acai bowl when I was the only customer there? I positioned myself so I could see the staff in the back, and they were just giggling and laughing, obviously taking their time. I couldn't imagine coming here during a busier time."}
{"text":"So delicious and such a nice alternative to ice cream. Can eat it for a meal or have it as a healthy treat. My kids love it"}
{"text":"I had been dying to try this...so glad I finally did. Such a yummy healthy alternative to ice cream. Also very filling. A great lunch option for the hot summer."}
{"text":"I'll start out by saying the bowls are yummy, but that is about the only good thing about this particular Thrive. The customer service is SO bad it overshadows the bowls.  I have been here about 3 or 4 times and I have had to wait 10+ minutes in the store every time, even when I called my order in ahead of time.  Furthermore, on more than one occasion, they have gotten my order wrong, or put the wrong toppings on the wrong bowl (when I ordered 2).  It's really not worth your time or energy to deal with this kind of service. Very unimpressed. Maybe the owner should consider hiring more people?"}
{"text":"We went here twice on our short stay in AZ. Bowls were a refreshing and healthy option on a hot AZ day. Lots of bowl choices and the menu outlines exactly what's in the bowl and what each bowl is topped with--that was nice. I had the Blackberry Walnut and Raspberry Lime. Both good. Bowls are huge, and I'm pretty sure they're bigger if you choose to stay. We got mediums both time but one time to go and one time to stay and the bowl seemed to be way bigger when we stayed and ate in the store. Prices are average for an acai bowl."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer since this place opened.  I came in today for a large berry smoothie with a couple of add-ins.  I specifically told the girl (long, curly red/blonde hair) no blackberries.  When I got home, there was definitely blackberries in it.  I was pulling giant seeds out of my teeth.  
I drove back down to get a new one as I paid almost $12 for it and I was rather irritated. 
When I confronted the same girl, she insisted several times that there weren't blackberries in it and I must be confusing the seeds with everything else possible in the drink.  After all of the back and forth I kindly asked her to remake it.  
She was not happy about it but did it anyway.  Several minutes later (not sure what took so long though I suspect she was complaining about me with the other girl behind the window) she very suspiciously handed me my drink with a devious look on her face.  
I didn't feel entirely comfortable drinking it afterward.  I feel as though something malicious was done to it.  My husband was there with me and got the same vibe.  

There are far too many local competitors for me to waste my time and money here again."}
{"text":"great! awesome! tasty ! fresh! i can go on forever I tried it for the first time about a month ago and now I'm kind of addicted. Their bowls are fresh and made on the spot making it all the more delightful experience. The place is always very clean and the employees are very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always get Acai Bowls when I am in California and it is so hard to find a good place in Arizona. Well... this is the place to go! The acai bowls are delicious, but my favorite are the pitaya bowls. I would recommend getting the Pitaya Colada. The smallest size is around $6, and it is worth driving to get! I would say that there small is actually pretty small, but it is really delicious!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time and I love the pitaya bowls but I'm reviewing their customer service. Every time I've visited this place, they're always super rude. No matter how nice I am they always seem to have an attitude and act like its gonna kill them if I add something to my bowl. I don't mind paying extra, either. The blonde girl with braces is especially super super rude and she doesn't even greet customers when she takes their order. Please get better employees. I can tell from reviews that this isn't just a problem with me. Also, I included a picture of a message I received from one of them probably after reading my review. Nice"}
{"text":"I just paid $7 for a chunky \"coco mocha\" smoothie. Took 10 minutes and they were busy.... Usually I get their bowls and they are bomb though! To each your own. As far as Marcys comment, I appreciate your response, I was talking about the ice as well. Like I said, your bowls are very good, probably won't get that shake again though!"}
{"text":"The service is great. The selection of the bowls is great. The fact that they use organic fruits is great. 

My big problem is that they use a pea protein blend and unfortunately, I didn't catch this until they were already working on my bowl, the protein mix they use is loaded with sugar. This completely takes away from the healthiness of these bowls. I will not return to the place unless they change their ingredients to include ONLY natural sweeteners and I will not recommend it to anyone. Very disappointed in this product."}
{"text":"Aaaasssighyeeeeeeeee!  It doesn't matter how you say it, you just have to try it! Lured in by a groupon and a growing addiction for smoothies I couldn't resist! I walked in for a smoothie and walked out addicted to the acia bowls! A tasty blend of fruit, acai sorbet, honey, granola, pea protein and even veggies blended into sweet perfection! The bowls are huge and are definitely sharable, perhaps a bit smaller when taken to go. They are made fresh so it does take a bit of time, if you're in a hurry you can call your order in ahead of time. My princess and I love the chocolate coconut(made with cocoa flavored pea protein) & the peanut butter bowl(made with cashew butter). The Green bowl is a sweet surprise with fruit and spinach.  We've had the cherry& mango smoothies, so yummy! Our punch card is over half way full, after 10 punches you receive a free medium bowl. Thrive is a fruit filled blend of guilt free perfection!"}
{"text":"UNSANITARY employee totally grossed us out! They have an observation window where you can watch them preparing your smoothie while you wait and my husband and I sat there for at least 15 to 20 minutes just watching while we waited because it was so interesting and there was one tall slender redheaded young man that never ever put the gloves on his hands however all the other employees had gloves on and this guy not only failed to wear gloves but he also was constantly touching or scratching his nose with his hands (!!!!!!) and we were both so grateful he was not the one that prepared what we had ordered!!! all of the employees were very friendly and there was another male worker in the same room with dark hair that was meticulous in cleaning the equipment he was using and it just amazed me that everyone was so careful to wear those sterile plastic gloves yet this redheaded guy was handling all of the foodduring preparation and never put the gloves on! GROSS! GROSS! GROSS!  and I totally hate hate hate leaving a negative review but this was so unprofessional and unsanitary I had to tell."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my healthy smoothie. This place is hidden but if you want a healthy drink-just stop. However be prepared to have some extra time as the service is a bit slow.  The prices appear high. 2 drinks $14."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've had the original acai bowl which is really good, but my favorite is the just acai bowl. It is more of an acai sorbet base with fruit & granola on top. I've also had the raspberry lime bowl which was also delicious. They have a rewards program so if you come here often like I do, you will quickly earn points towards a free bowl!"}
{"text":"Great customer service with a nice environment. It's in a nice quiet place of Gilbert. Employees are so friendly. And our \"call in\" order was brought out in less than 10mins. This is the best place to go to if you have a sweet tooth but still want to stay healthy."}
{"text":"This place is acai-mazing! Seriously I'm sad I no longer live in the area so I can't frequent this place more often. They exclusively sell acai bowls, pitaya bowls, smoothies and some protein powder and quest bars. So.... don't come here for a sandwich and act surprised.

What I love...
-nutrition facts available
-chocolate peanut butter bowl
-plentiful nuts and granola on top
-even a small is super filling
-satisfies my sweets craving with natural sugars
-chocolate peanut butter bowl
-perfect consistency. It's just like fro-yo. I've wasted time and money trying to make my own which are just smoothies. 
- chocolate peanut butter bowl
-consistent product
-better bowls than Neckter for sure. (I've never had Thrive's smoothies so I can't speak to that)

Why is one star missing then? 
- sometimes staffing issues. They seem to have solved weekend problems that I've had when they just opened. But sometimes I'll even call ahead on a weekday night and they say half hour to pick up. Really? You can get delivered whole entrees quicker than that! This is honestly just a matter of blending some fruit together. Despite their expertise (and my lack of) using a blender, its not worth a thirty minute wait. 

So if you're not in a hurry or starving definitely stop by Thrive Acai Bowls. A good snack, dessert, or even a decent meal substitute if you get a medium or large size. I feel pretty confident you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This was my first time stopping by Genuine Fresche. Jake was so helpful and guided me along as I was selecting what would be best for me and my nutritional requests. It was an excellent choice! I highly recommend stopping by for a deelish and great experience!"}
{"text":"Way good!! Many great options. And not only are they pricy but they also ask for a tip, tryin to break my bank for a smoothie thing lol ACAI!!!!"}
{"text":"My mom and I's favorite acai bowl place. Really yummy and lots of options. She normally gets the tropical pitaya and I get the spinach acai. Delicious and healthy :)"}
{"text":"Finally came to try this place and I am very happy with the Go Green bowl! I think the only green part of it is the spinach, but it was still delicious. 
4 stars because I was hoping for more of a yogurt style than a sorbet (which is mixed with cane sugar) but then vegans and lactose intolerants wouldn't be able to enjoy it also, so that's fair! Will definitely come back. 
Also, it's really not that expensive. I mean for 7 bucks I had my regular-sized bowl as a meal. Totally worth it!! 
The girls were all super awesome and explained everything to me since it was my first time in. :)"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place for an acai bowl! First time going so I got the original and it did not disappoint. The fruit was fresh and the honey and granola was a nice touch!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time the other day and i think its my new favorite resteraunt! Ever since going vegan i have had a hard time finding a good resteraunt to eat at and i wanted to keep it safe and i got the original acai bowl. I got it without bananas due to my alergie but it was still one of the best lunches i have had in a while. The survice was fast and polite. I will be coming back soon"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for the first time. My 11 year old wanted to try an acai bowl. I walked in for a take out order.  We had an Original, a Chocolate Peanut butter and a Chocolate Walnut. Overall, the bowls were very tasty, however, the walnut had no walnuts on it at all. I felt like they could of used a little less granola and a little more of the acai blend. It would have been nice if the bowls were labeled or marked as well because for our first time visting we didn't know what to expect and had to refer back to the menu to figure who's bowl was whose. We will definitely be back to try some other blends."}
{"text":"I have been going to Genuine Fresche every week since they opened. My experience yesterday was AMAZING! They always go above and beyond to make sure everything is right. They even offered to get my dog a bowl of water. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Stopped in because I was craving an Acai bowl and did not want the usual Nektar or Jamba bowls. This place has a variety of bowls to choose from  and you can order a small,medium, or large which is nice compared to the other places that only have one size. Price is consistent with other chains but taste was definitely far above. Definitely will be back to enjoy more. The only reason for 4 stars is there was a little bit of a wait but in the end worth it. So if you are not in a rush this place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"I love this place!  It is a healthier treat. My favorite is the raspberry lime but I have loved everything I have ever tried!  Everyone is always super friendly.  I think it is a bit pricey but they do have a punch card which always motivates me to return so I can eventually get a free one!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Acai bowls are great and small little joint is authentic and fresh. Not the fastest if your in a hurry. The chocolate peanut butter is my favorite but they are all great. The small is very filling not sure who needs a large unless you plan to share it take home and freeze. The drinks are limited to smoothies and bottled water and tea. It would be nice to be able to order a nice coffee. They are currently remodeling to be able to have a juice bar. Been coming here since they opened and plan to continue to return."}
{"text":"I had the chocolate coconut acai bowl. It was delicious, but very sweet and could be a desert. I would choose this over ice cream for a treat night and not feel guilty. In fact I had it for breakfast and don't feel guilty. :). Topped with fresh fruit, chocolate and coconut shavings. Yum!!!! I got a small and it was enough to fill me up. Kids had smoothies and my husband had a power  shake. My family approves and we'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"I have been going to Thrive/Fresche for awhile now and LOVE the bowls!  However I do not enjoy eating there at all, the place smells heavily of bleach or some chemical but is not clean??  Especially all the seating, it is stained and looks very dirty. I understand they can not control customers that make a mess but they really need to take more pride in cleaning promptly and replacing items that get destroyed.  Sitting outside is also a no go as it smells of trash. I am sure there is a dumpster near by that is probably out of their control.  With that said my recommendation would be to get your bowl to go and call ahead to avoid the wait. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My favorite is the Chocolate Coconut Acai bowls and Smoothies. They make everything fresh so it does take a while. But if you call ahead they will have it ready for you when you arrive! It is a healthy option, and works great for my family as it is dairy free and gluten free! 
This is the real stuff, I have tried other places and it is not the same, you can tell they are using real fruit. 
The owners are really nice as well and we love that they are on the Arizona Trade Exchange!  Can't wait for my next smoothie!"}
{"text":"The food was actually really good, the issue was with the service. I went early around 9:30am during a weekday and they were already slammed.It looked like they opened late, because they were still setting up the chairs even though they were supposedly open a half hour earlier. The guy at the counter looked frazzled and stressed, and all the tables looked dirty even though the place had just opened. It may have just been a bad day though. I would go back just to see if this was bad timing."}
{"text":"I love Acai bowls and started making them at home recently until I discovered this place. Brad and Marcy introduced a healthier way of eating to the Valley in 2011. Now they have a few locations you can try some of their yummy bowls at. I've had their original bowl and loved it. I will admit I was skeptical in trying one of the chocolate or peanut butter bowls, but the chocolate coconut is amazing! The food here is super good and healthy. My only knock on this location is that it is located in Fulton Ranch Town Center. That place is a maze and stores can be a bit hard to find."}
{"text":"Best acai bowls anywhere! Chocolate coconut is my favorite. 

Anytime i travel i go to places that sell acai bowls & they never compare to Thrive/Fresche. This place has so many varieties of bowls & sizes. It truly is a meal. I love that there are so many mix ins & protein options. 

I have read other reviews about the wait, but they do prepare everything fresh after you order it so i'm not sure how long people think  it will take. I have waited anywhere from 5-15 minutes for my food, which is not a long time. 

My only criticism is that the chandler location doesn't have a door sealing off the back area- just a wall. This makes the front customer area loud when they are running the blenders. 

I love this place & now that there is a chandler location will be there a lot!"}
{"text":"I had heard of this place from a friend but hadn't made it over since it is not close to my home. I went today for lunch & it was fantastic! I was initially concerned it wouldn't be enough food for a whole meal but it really was. 

They have a choice of 10-15 different acai bowls, which is what i was interested in. They also have smoothies. You pick a bowl flavor but can also upgrade & add a variety  of extras- like nut butter, protein powder, hemp seeds, etc. the bottom half of the bowl is the thick acai smoothie part, & the top has granola, fruit & other goodies!

I got the chocolate coconut bowl which came with almond butter & chocolate pea protein so i didn't need to do a protein ad in. The top had granola, strawberries, bananas, coconut. It was so fantastic! I loved every bite!

I hope they expand & put a location in south chandler or gilbert. I would go several times a week! But even at a 25 minute drive i will be back!"}
{"text":"I used to love it here when this place was Thrive. I'm not sure when it changed, but I feel like the quality of the food and service decreased at the same time. 

I came here a couple of days ago with a friend for smoothie bowls. When we ordered, the guy seemed like he didn't want to be there. Once our food came out, my friend noticed that there was a long hair mixed in with hers (like not just on top, so we know it wasn't hers). I got the blackberry walnut with pea protein, which was very good. It was just hard to enjoy it after seeing a hair pulled out of my friend's food."}
{"text":"Healthy food and the staff is friendly. One suggestion is to order ahead of time if you're in a rush. Just call 30 min before and say you'll come by to pick it up or have it at the place itself at whatever time you need. I feel a lot of people who come in here are confused as to why it takes so long, but people need to realize, they make everything from scratch. Everything is fresh and cut right after you order whatever you do, that way your order is not soggy or rotten. Staff is so helpful and sweet as the food they make. The place is always clean, and I've never had an order messed up here."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite of mine, especially post workout!  I love the peanut butter flavor, but all are very good. The name says it all, very fresh, healthy foods!  It's nice when you are craving a healthy treat!"}
{"text":"Be careful if you are trying to \"be healthy\" here. I can't imagine that caloric impact these bowls impart.  SO MUCH ADDED SUGAR. Natural sugar too... but even that much natural sugar can't be good.

Make your own shake or ask what is in each item, cause you will be downing 1/2 a days worth of calories in one gulp, if you aren't careful."}
{"text":"Had the tropical Acai bowl which came w
Mangos, coconut and peach Acai sorbet. I prefer the original over the tropical because of the strawberries and blueberries and dark sorbet. I give this place a 3 star. It's alright but there's definitely better out there - the customer service could be better as well"}
{"text":"I have been to this Thrive! several times and they have always been great! This last time I bought a small acaci bowl to go and spilled it just as I was getting out of my car.  I was really looking forward to this for my dessert so I went back ready to pay for another one.  I went in and explained what had happened and that I didn't mind paying for another.  The guy at the front said it was no problem and that he would just go back and make another one for me!  The entire staff was very friendly and of course the food was great! They're acai bowls are DELICIOUS, very healthy (except for maybe being high in sugar but what are you gonna do, theres a ton of fruit on there!), and reasonably priced for the freshness of the ingredients you are getting.  Overall, definitely recommend Thrive! and especially this location!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for a few years and the service and food is consistently good. They offer a pretty good variety of açaí bowls, especially compared to other places, at fair prices. Definitely a good choice if you're looking for a quick, healthy option."}
{"text":"I judge acai bowls based on the acai bowls that I've eaten up in the San Diego and Santa Cruz areas. For some reason, california acai bowls are  the best. Thrive comes the closest to replicating the taste and quality from the ones i've chowed down on in cali. 

I do enjoy the fact that they have about 5 different sizes - I dont always have to over indulge if I dont want to. I tend to go here after a workout or just to study. They have protein boosts and free wifi - can't get better than that. I do wish they put slices of strawberries in the acai bowl instead of blending them into the actual acai, but the bananas and honey do make up for it.

I wish they would have a complete list of their nutritional value....for some reason they have conspicuously left off the sugar content of their bowls, but have every other nutritional value under the sky. And as a side note, they get their bananas from Wal-Mart. I really hate wal-mart and everything they stand for, but I wont go as far as to boycott Thrive. 

The owners are super nice, the atmosphere is great, the prices are competitive, and its really the only acai bowl place that you will find in the gilbert area. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Thrive is a great little place to grab a healthy snack or go for an all fruit inspired lunch.  All of their menu items taste great and are also very appealing visually.  They use a lot of fresh ingredients and everything is fruit and acai based.  I have tried almost every bowl on the menu and I have yet to find one that I dislike (The raspberry is a little tart, but I think that almost makes it better!).  I haven't tried many of their smoothies, but they all sound great.  They have a lot of options in case you don't like the ingredients or have food intolerance issues (think glutten-free granola here).  The staff is always super nice and warm towards anyone who comes through the doors, even when they are crazy busy.  They are really good at accommodating phone orders and do a good job in paying attention to large orders, like when our whole office decides to call in at once.  Their gift cards are a great little treat to give and receive.   

I only have two reasons for it not getting a perfect five stars: 

1. Since they opened the Tempe location and have updated their menus, you get quite a bit less acai blended goodness per bowl and they have instead added a lot of \"fluff\" to the top in the way of extra granola and fresh toppings.  Personally, I liked it better before when they offered more substance than just a scoop of granola and a few banana slices.  

2.  I think it's a little pricey for what you get.  A medium sized bowl averages around $8 .  These are all items that can be easily re-created at home for a fraction, but, I guess you pay for convenience and a clean kitchen. 

Definitely a place I know I will go back to time and time again though.  It's a healthy alternative to all the junky fast food joints that are in the area."}
{"text":"I went to Thrive for the first time yesterday. It's a really cute and small establishment and the employees were very friendly.
I was kind of overwhelmed by the amount of options for acai bowls. I ended up getting a chocolate peanut butter acai bowl and my friend got the original. They were delicious! The peanut butter was really filling and the fruit seemed very fresh. I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Loveeeee! So good! Their tropical bowl is my favorite. Wouldn't recommend their juices though."}
{"text":"I love these bowls!  They are delicious and a pretty healthy alternative to ice cream.  I wish I could go more.  They're a little expensive, but I can understand when you look at all the ingredients and the time it takes to make each one.  

If you go when there are a few people ahead of you, it might be easier to come back because they do get behind really quickly.  I'm glad they make them in the little closet room with the window because it's loud in there.

The decor is decent in the front, though there are times when the tables or chairs needed wiping down but everyone's in back working hard.  The back of the store is not really well defined with boxes of ingredients and supplements.

Once, my daughter found a long blonde hair in her bowl and it grossed her out.  I think it's because of the frenzy in the blender room.  Maybe hairnets are necessary?"}
{"text":"when you walk in the door the color scheme is a lot like jamba juice but they got half way there and stopped.  so it is left looking less like a healthfood/smoothie place and more like a commercial doctors office.  you have to ask what is in each smoothie as the ingredients are nowhere to be found.  I was hoping to see sugar and calorie counts.  a large smoothie seems half the size of jambas and cost a lot more.  there is a window where you can see the workers in back all having a good time and barely working on your order and I was told the owner was there!  the tropical smoothie I got was so so.  wont be back."}
{"text":"Acai bowls at thrive are my favorite! Especially the peanut butter one! I love that they have gluten free options too! I love this place. Sometimes service is a little slow but it's worth it"}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of acai bowls in California and I have to say that the ones here at Fresche are the best I've ever eaten.  I love the chocolate coconut acai bowl which keeps me full for hours. The tropical acai bowl is light and fresh with mango, pineapple, and coconut. They also offer ones with almond and cashew butter which add a richness and keep me satisfied longer.  Also, such a cute inviting place for lunch dates. I'm definitely addicted!"}
{"text":"I come here pretty often with friends, I love their bowls and have never been disappointed with their product. It is for that reason alone I continue to come back. That being said, the customer service almost always is sub-par. Being someone who also works in food service, I get it is not always easy to be enthusiastic about your work... but it really is EVERY time I have been here that the employees look miserable. Although it is often different people ringing me up, their poor attitude is similar. It would be a nice change to get some employees who welcome the customers when they walk through the door and act happy to be serving them."}
{"text":"I had no idea what an acai bowl was when we arrived.  The gal behind the counter explained it as a thick smoothie in a bowl that is topped with granola and other items that you eat with a spoon.  No idea they were so big or filling.  We ordered 3 - Chocolate Walnut, Chocolate Coconut and Raspberry Lime.  I thought the Raspberry Lime was by far the best flavor.  We didn't finish them and I think it was quite pricey.  I would recommend if you have never been to order one - try it - and then order more if you like it or are still hungry.  Also, the kids and I realized we are not fans of granola.  So.... if we ever try it again we will order without granola or just try the smoothies."}
{"text":"The bowls and smoothies are great (My favorite is the tropical bowl... yum!) but the last few times we've been here we've had to wait a REALLY long time to get our food. Yesterday we sat for 35 minutes waiting for 3 smoothies and 2 bowls. My kids were so anxious to leave. There were at least 3 groups of people who came in and were told it would be 30+ minutes so they left. Not sure if they need more help or more equipment, but timeliness has been a huge issue. Other than that, I love the healthier option for a summer treat! The staff is also very polite."}
{"text":"Love the product but customer service sucks. Not only are most employees slow 
uninterested  and/or distracted but the seemed to have issues with customer ethnicity . Buyer beware !!!"}
{"text":"Not your regular smoothie shop, I was introduced to this place by a \"health nut\" friend of mine. He goes all the time. They even have a bowl named after him. Not sure what is the difference but you can ask for \"Cody Style\" and they will know what you mean. I was surprised that it seemed to fill me up, or that I felt full quite a long time after eating a bowl. And it tastes good too! Chocolate coconut is my favorite."}
{"text":"I don't live in AZ, but when I'm in town, I always come here. Best Acai bowls I've had anywhere"}
{"text":"Today was my first time at Thrive Acai Bowls. I was born and raised in Hawaii and I'm here visiting my brother and his family for the summer. There's a nice little joint that I went to regularly in Hawaii that makes THE BEST acai bowls and when I came up here and found out about Thrive you can imagine how excited I was. I must say that it was a little weird to me that they made the bowls in a back room because back in Hawaii they make it right in front of you and dice up fresh fruit and here it's prepared in a separate room. The other thing that bothered me was that we were the only ones in there and it took 20 minutes before they brought out just 1 of our bowls! four other girls came in about 10 minutes after us and they all got their bowls before us! Although they were a lot skimpier on the fruit than I'm used to it was delicious and the staff were fairly friendly. Overall the place is okay! However, Hawaii will always be my favorite place for an Acai Bowl! :~)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! It taste very natural & very healthy. I tried the go green and my hubby had the original both were great.  Forget ice cream, I've found something better and healthier. Staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time. And today was horrible customer service! Such a bummer because I love this place. I always say if you don't like your job...get a new one! But don't make it a bad experience for your regulars or your new customers."}
{"text":"Thrive strives to serve authentic Acai bowls similar to those served in Acai's native Brasil, but falls short. Anyone looking for authentic Brasilian-style Acai be warned; it's not like back home.

I think I tasted Acai once while consuming my bowl, in the second to last bite.

I will, however, mention that the bowl tasted great, and the granola/honey mixture was excellent. But die-hard Acai fans who know traditional Acai will be somewhat disappointed. I'm not sure what upset me more, the fact that it wasn't traditional Brasilian, or the fact that the employees tried to tell me that Brasilians always mix strawberries, blueberries, apple juice, etc, into their Acai (false). It's worth a try, but if you can live without the granola/honey/bananas on top, you might as well get the Acai smoothie at Jamba. Tastes darn near the same, only it's cheaper."}
{"text":"pros:
- great tasting acai
- fresh fruits

cons:
- overwhelming smell of bleach in store
- stingy portions

five star acai bowls. but man, this place stinks.

i ordered the original acai bowl that contains strawberries, bananas, blueberries, granola, and honey atop an acai berry blend. tasted amazing, all the fruits were very fresh, and i had no complaints about the food itself. one problem--the restaurant smelled very strongly of bleach, and it obscured the taste of the food so much that i had to eat outside. not sure if it is the cleaning product they use or something else, but it was so intrusive that couldn't even taste was i was eating! i paid 75 extra cents for more strawberries, but i received a total of 4 cut strawberries on top of the granola. other acai joints i have been to give you a minimum of 7-10 strawberries without having to pay extra. i would return simply because of how good it tasted, but the overall experience leaves something to be desired.

a side-note is that their eat-in portions are bigger than their takeout portions. a small for eating in is the same size as a medium takeout, and a medium for eating in is a large in their takeout size."}
{"text":"Had one of their large Tropical cups for the first time today. WOW. I am a picky easter  
and it was fantastic Will be taking the family back soon!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place but they've cut down their portions, have gotten cheap, stopped putting a decent amount of fruit, and girls had an attitude. Definitely not worth the price anymore!"}
{"text":"This is a cool little place my teenage daughter brought me too. Nice and trendy quick service. I ordered a small bowl of coconut, pineapple, granola, and something else. I couldn't imagine ordering a medium or a large. The small filled me up. That was our lunch for the day since we're now vegetarian. I like it, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Whoever invented this whole acai bowl fad, I am your biggest fan! And thank goodness for this local place to bless Arizona with their presence in several locations. I had tried my first acai bowl at a different local juice bar and was quite loyal to them until I came across Thrive! The price to portion ratio is the best of all the places of tried and I've tried A LOT. If there's acai on the menu, I get it. But Thrive definitely is at the top of my list. I have never been to a place that serves so many varieties and plays on flavors of acai! It is superfood to it's highest degree. All the ingredients are high quality and fresh to the taste. It must help to be located right next to Sprouts! The plaza itself is a win with these 2 businesses in existence. The staff is always super friendly. It can get busy so be prepared to wait a few minutes for your order - don't come here if you're in any rush. You do have the option to call in your order though I have never tried it. I also suggest having your bowl 'for here' because it feels like you get more bang for your buck in their dine-in bowls compared to the to-go bowls. A small is more than filling for one. The boyfriend enjoys their smoothies. Always love the music playing, that is a plus. There's limited seating inside. A few tables outside. They sell Quest bars in a number of flavors for those on the prowl for them. And other healthy snacks as well as a brand of protein and supplements I believe. Free wifi. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I waited 25 minutes for $5 yogurt with granola (the peanut butter acai bowl), and the store wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Good stuff! Seems to be relatively healthy. Great snack  before or after the gym. 4 stars because of inconsistency in the bowls. Ex. Sometimes you get honey, sometimes you don't."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to get açaí bowls from. They have many delicious options to choose from! It can take some time for the bowl to be made but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Delish! Healthy, refreshing, and unique. Gluten free granola is offered too :)"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! I am in no way a vegan, vegetarian, or organic food person, I am just in love with the taste of their bowls. I've had some really good acai bowls in Hawaii & California, but this place is by far my favorite place to get one. When I'm home, I'm usually here once a week and I think they all know my order before I say it. It's worth a try, especially if you've never tried an acai bowl before."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years and they have updated it quite a bit. It used to take a long time to get your bowl, but today they were fast!The acai bowls are tasty, but I have yet to try a smoothie or juice."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Genuine Fresche since they opened. It's my favorite post workout meal! Their acai bowls are amazing. I've tried many of their bowls and smoothies, but I normally get the Go Greens bowl with added pea protein powder and switch the apple juice for water and skip the honey. Their bowls are so tasty, I don't feel like the extra sweeteners are necessary. Pay attention to their Instagram page because they often offer discounts."}
{"text":"The bowls are very delicious and refreshing. Plus, I don't feel bad about myself afterwards like I do when I eat ice cream."}
{"text":"I love this place. The Acai bowls are delicious. I usually get the Go Green or Tropical one and they are so good. I've also tried a green juice before and it was equally approved. I typically order a small and I feel like it's the perfect size to eat in one sitting. The ingredients are fresh, it's a healthy snack or breakfast and I've never had a bad experience. 

Note: If you have the Hooked app they usually offer deals like 20% off or a free size upgrade. Also, they have their own rewards program where you enter your phone number and earn points for  your visit which will eventually equal a free item."}
{"text":"Such an amazing treat! I will definitely be coming back here instead of going for an ice cream. I had the Raspberry Lime Acai bowl and it was delicious."}
{"text":"My favorite Acai place by far with the best prices and portion sizes. The staff is usually friendly and accommodating and they have wi-fi if you need to catch up on emails or homework. I love the chocolate peanut butter bowl. And as a vegan I asked about their granola which apparently does not contain honey. I didn't chance the shaved chocolate since that can be iffy, but the bowl is great without it. I wish they wouldn't charge for extra toppings or to replace it with something else though, but all Acai places do that so it's the only downside. Way better than berry divine Acai bowls. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place has the best acai bowls! They give bigger portion sizes, and have much better flavors than a lot of the other places I've been to offering acai bowls. My favorite is their chocolate peanut butter and what's great is you can substitute out the peanut butter for any other nut butter if you want. They also make their own nut butters apart from almond butter (which they said was really hard and expensive to make). I thought that was really good to know because it means they take pride in making their own ingredients from scratch. Also, they have a delicious pea protein that you can substitute in for any of their items that have whey protein. I think their prices are much better than other places too and you can also substitute or opt out of any of the toppings if you want to customize your bowl. It's also a great place because they recycle their spoons which is nice to know because it's more environmentally friendly. By far, this is my favorite acai place I've tried, and I'll be back as often as possible. It feels indulgent, but it's super healthy and who doesn't want the best of both worlds? Definitely give this place a try if you're in town!"}
{"text":"I usually order the  Chocolate Peanut Butter or Chocolate Walnut bowl and they are amazing.  Great post workout treat."}
{"text":"One of my very favorite places to come. My three year old also loves it. I tell her we're getting ice cream. lol. I don't even know which one is my favorite. Maybe the peanut butter and chocolate. But love all of them. The staff at the Tempe and Mesa locations are always super friendly. You won't be disapointed!"}
{"text":"I love these bowls. The Chandler location I go to has always been great with customer service. However, when I was there last week, I was extremely disappointed in the Styrofoam bowls, and the decreased amount served. You cant move your fruit around the bowl, its packed in so tight. It takes away from the experience to have taken the colored bowls away. The obvious cut in the amount served was just as disappointing. For almost $6.00 a small bowl, I may think twice before I make a special trip to get one."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  I feel like I just paid too much for frozen yogurt with fruit on top.  The bowl I had was a cherry walnut, and it was okay.  It definitely didn't blow my mind.  The fact that they have all of their vitamins and supplements in bottled powder or liquid form tells me their idea of nutrition is a little off base.  Also - I realize this isn't entirely their fault, but there is a nail salon next door and the odor of acetone coming through into their shop is - overwhelming!  I don't see how anyone eats in there, it was nauseating.  The smell of chemicals isn't really synonymous with the healthy image they're trying to create.  Also the atmosphere is a bit clinical... The shop is very sparse, so sound just echoes everywhere and it's just kind of awkward.  
All in all, I'd say this place is \"eh\" at best... If you're looking for something that is really healthy - go to Chop Shop or Green."}
{"text":"Just got back from Thrive.  I got the blackberry bowl.

It was really tart, which I guess I should have expected from blackberries.  And then there was the sorbet with granola and some fruit on top.  It tasted like...  sorbet with granola.

And that's fine.  I don't see why everyone is raving about Thrive, but the bowl I got was okay.  I wouldn't be averse to eating at Thrive again, but I won't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Definitely one of my favorite places of all time to have breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a dessert! The staff is so friendly and welcoming. I LOVE how the place is decorated and furnished. My favorite bowl is the strawberry passion. PLUS it's good for you! They use whole fruit and the granola is to die for! Let me tell you people; I'm addicted to the max. I would eat this stuff for every meal if I could. Their location is perfectly placed right next to Hamilton High school. I love to support small businesses, so this is the perfect place for me. 
They also do juices and protein shakes! Their juices are so good and refreshing. They definitely beat every smoothie/juicing place out of the water."}
{"text":"The staff is always super friendly and I always leave happy! I bring friends here all the time and they all love it as well :) Excited they are so close to my home as well !"}
{"text":"Honestly this place is a hot mess, last time I went in I stood at the counter for like 5 minutes, the store was dead and no one came to take my order. The bell rings when you open the door so no excuse. This time there was a massive frozen chunk of something at the bottom of my smoothie, their cups are small enough to begin with so 1/4 of my smoothie ended up being undrinkable. Not to mention every time I go there's a new worker who gives me a snotty look and has no idea what they are doing. I swear I order the same thing every time and every time my cost ends up being different. Like is it extra to replace one fruit with another or not people, figure it out."}
{"text":"We love this place. Their bowls rock, the ingredients and options are great and it's a fantastic treat or meal replacement especially in our long hot months.

Bring back the bowls. If I wanted my food crammed in a to go cup, I would, well order it to go. Those containers are terrible for eating the bowl and getting the right flavor and ingredients in a bite. BRING BACK THE BOWLS. Not to mention more disposable products filling up our landfills aren't needed!!!"}
{"text":"Geez these people are so slow.  Ordered a smoothie took them 20 mins to get it done.  Should have got my money back."}
{"text":"I go here every week. This place has the best acai bowls in Arizona! I have tried bowls from at least 5 other places in the valley and nothing compares to Thrive! The chocolate walnut is my go to and I also love the chocolate coconut and the tropical. Their new fresh pressed juices and protein shakes are also incredible! Staff is always warm and welcoming. ILOVETHRIVE"}
{"text":"So delicious! My favorite healthy snack. Love this place and their employees. Very relaxing environment."}
{"text":"BEST place to grab an acai bowl. they have so many flavors to choose from and they're all so yummy! my favorite is strawberry passion with coconut chips. they have so many different add ins and the options are endless. not to mention they have great smoothies and power shakes as well! their customer service is stellar and they're always so nice! I would recommend calling in or placing your order online, as they make everything fresh and made to order. I wouldn't go anywhere else for an acai bowl!"}
{"text":"I have tried so many different places for acai bowls and this is by far the best and cheapest for what you get. They also have a rewards program where every 9 bowls you get the 10th free. I'm from Arizona but unfortunately do not live here. When I do move back this Willy go to spot for acai bowls for sure. 

The price: all other acai bowl places charge how much this place does for a large for the size of the small here which is $5-6 here. It's filling and worth it because it's actually a meal. You also get more than what you pay for here because their bowls include protein for no extra charge, it's actually apart of a lot of the bowls. That for me was a huge bonus when I'm trying to be healthy and make a meal out of it. The smoothies are also very well priced. I got the green one a small, which was filling and it was under $4. What a steal! All the smoothies are great prices. 

The location: it's located right across from Hamilton high school and LA fitness. So for those of you trying to be healthy like me and get a quick meal before or after the gym this is a great spot to get up. It's also in a cute shopping center. 

The staff: they've always been more than wonderful!"}
{"text":"Thrive is amazing! The bowls are delicious and healthy! I would not recommend anyone to try the protein shakes, they are extremely chalky and not at all tasty. The employees were kind and accommodating. My sister got a shake and wanted more strawberries because she couldn't taste them. They agreed with enthusiasm and added more strawberries with out any extra charge!

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Every bowl that I have tried has been delicious!"}
{"text":"Usually these cups are filled to the top.....I am extremely pissed that I was cheated of the proper amount of delicious thrive. I am a valued and frequent customer. I bought FOUR and they were all like this. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"I love this place but it's just a bit too expensive for me to become a regular here. However, many people have contested that Acai berries are just expensive to begin with so I won't deduct any stars in my review.

Medium bowls are about $8, and large bowls are around $10. Large bowls are great for sharing between two people though.

It's always fresh and clean here, and the service is always great. I love that they have a window to the kitchen. I don't love that the place smells like a nail polish remover."}
{"text":"The kids working here are always super nice and respectful, it's clean and happy inside and their menu is AWESOME. I always get the \"Just Acai\" bowl with peanut butter- awesome for a light lunch or post-workout meal. I find that the Just Acai is less tart than the others because they don't mix the Acai sorbet with strawberries and apple juice- just a tip. The only downside is it seems to take a while to get your order sometimes, but then again it's a busy spot and the kitchen isn't huge. Even so it's never a crazy wait! Love this place, great job!"}
{"text":"My favorite is the original with chopped walnuts on top. A small is very generous. It's my guilty pleasure treat!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! I'm from San Diego, where acai bowls are essentially worshiped, and this place definitely stood up! The best part is that there are a lot of options. They have like 20 variations to choose from. It's awesome! Will continuously drop in!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I had absolutely no idea what an acai bowl was up until now. That being said, of course, I had to try Thrive! to find out what it was all about. For anyone else that was confused like me out there, it is basically a smoothie in a bowl. Think a yogurt parfait but with acai sorbet instead since they are dairy, soy, and sugar free. It was very good. I love the tart taste of acai and the fruit that they used was fresh. The staff was patient while I took my time trying to decide what I wanted to order. No line at all on a Monday around noon. I wouldn't go so far to say it is a meal but rather a delicious treat and healthier than other possible options."}
{"text":"I LOVE THRIVE!!!! They are my favorite place to go for a yummy treat. It tastes sinfully delicious but it's heavenly good for you! No added junk, just healthy delicious fruit pureed to a soft serve consistency with oats and honey for an extra treat! My favorite is the peanut butter! What kind are you going to try?"}
{"text":"These bowls are incredible for breakfast or any time of the day really.  I just like to have mine in the morning.  I eat one of these and I'm ready to rock.  Forget coffee, you wanna start the day off right and have energy to burn? Have a large \"tropical\" with sliced almonds instead of granola.  It's pure magic!!"}
{"text":"I am updating my review .. I've been going to Fresche for years (prior to the name change) and this is hands down my favorite acai bowl in the valley.  The chocolate coconut is heaven. They have shakes, power shakes (include protein) and now fresh juices.  The juices are awesome and reasonably priced! Highly recommend you get over here if you haven't yet.
p.s. They've also added online ordering to their website, so you don't have to wait if you go online and order ahead. Call in ordering is also available.  =)"}
{"text":"This place rocks. I almost can't go a day without having a bowl. 
I always get raspberry pecan or Strawberry passion. But I think you really can't go wrong with any of the flavors! And the fact that the bowls are made with all whole foods, no add-ins of sugar or ice or excessive liquid. This stuff fills me up and I'm a growing boy, so I usually have a problem finding places that do that for me!
You have to come try this at least once! But I'll warn you, you'll become addicted!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after hearing so much about these trendy little acai bowls. I have to say...they are SO good! I've had a handful of the bowls on their menu and I've enjoyed all of them. Just depends on what I'm in the mood for flavor wise. I love the chocolate ones because they satisfy my sweet tooth without all the guilt  I will definitely be returning many more times to come!"}
{"text":"Vegan paradise (excluding honey if you're one of those)! This place is the only thing my morning sickness will really crave, haha. If you think it's \"frozen yogurt\" then you have no idea what an acai bowl is and have no business reviewing this place anyway. You've probably paid more at one of those weigh-out-pounds-of-yogurt places, blarg."}
{"text":"Super yummy but super expensive!!!   I went for brunch and am still hungry after my awesome peanut butter bowl!"}
{"text":"This place is seriously amazing,  I have been going here at least one else a week for a year and I never get sick of their food.  The strawberry passion fruit bowl is my favorite."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Acai Bowl shops in the area, and not one of them can match Genuine Fresh. Perfect balance of sweet and tart, nice thick texture, fresh fruit topping and never-fail fresh granola. I don't even care for granola, but the granola offered here is delicious. I always call in so I can get my bowl right away. You can do online orders too. What can I say, Im hooked!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great bowls, and have been coming here consistently since opening day. Although I've never had any outstanding customer service. No employee is ever excited to be here or excited to help a customer."}
{"text":"Yummy it is like desert for lunch.  Super healthy and  and fresh!  I got the Go Greens bowl and it was fantastic and all natural. Will go again!"}
{"text":"I ordered a bowl and received a bowl of granola drizzled with not-completely-blended frozen fruit... for $6.00. After years of coming here, I probably won't be returning. The increased prices and decreased quality really deters even loyal customers. Such a bummer."}
{"text":"If the acai bowls were cheaper we would go every day, but they are a bit pricey so we reserve them for the occasional, healthy treat.  Seriously all these bowls are delicious and they reek of goodness and good health. 

If ya have a group or you plan to order more than a few it would be wise to call far enough ahead to allow the folks time to make them.  It seems they are a bit prep intensive.

Haven't tried the smoothies, still can't get by the bowls.

Four stars because of the price and the time it takes to make them, but still Thrive is a great place and we're regulars."}
{"text":"15 different available bowl options plus smoothies, & snacks. Available bowls are a tasty sorbet type treat/meal. Store is a little boring inside & small but you don't come for the ambiance you come for the bowls which are delicious. Service can be a little slow at times but well worth the wait. Try it, you know you want to."}
{"text":"A good place to get a refreshing and yummy snack. Staff is usually very friendly, but when ordering for pick up they need to work on their time estimates. They usually give a shorter waiting time than it actually takes to make the bowl, and you end up waiting there for like 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Was on a hunt for a good healthy vegan place for a treat, and was pleased to find this place, not too far away from where my boyfriend lives! 

I had never really had an Acai Bowl before, so it was a new experience for me. I got the peanut butter chocolate one and it was very good, very filling as well. I ordered a small but I think they gave me a medium because there was a lot. I could barely finish is, and usually I eat like a cow. My meat-eating boyfriend enjoyed it as well, he got a chocolate coconut acai bowl. Also had trouble finishing his.

I came to Thrive a second time, at the other location, and got a chocolate coconut smoothie. I was less impressed with the smoothie, but it was still pretty good.

Both times there was a bit of a wait to get the bowl/ smoothie, but there could be many understandable reasons for that. Also kind of expensive, but they have fresh ingredients so it is expected! 

My bf and I will be back! This is a great place for healthy, filling, vegan-friendly treats. Happy to have discovered this place..thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"I love the pitaya colada bowl.  This was my first visit to this location.  It's small, but the service was great & fast.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm from CA the LA area there are acai places everywhere and this is not a acai bowl!! They use sorbet.

The restaurant from the walk in had a smell to it it's very plain and not decorated well. No one greeted us!! One of the girls was sitting on the back counter eating pizza or a sandwich ummm yuck!!!  Won't be retuning can't wait to be home for a real acai bowl!!!"}
{"text":"OMG this was unbelievably tasty and uber healthy.

Its like a smoothie in a bowl but BETTER.

I tried the Original by the servers recommendation. Good choice!
Acai, strawberries, blueberries all mixed up topped with granola and bananas and drizzled with honey.
No added ice or sugar.
So so tasty and refreshing.
Kinda wish I'd ordered the large!"}
{"text":"Seriously so good! Love this place, nice interior with a little book nook and the smoothie bowls are awesome!"}
{"text":"OMG ...  sooo good! I have even ordered this by door dash when I am too lazy to drive over!! I LOVE this place, it's so fresh and delicious. I love that I can order online for pickup AND the ability to get it delivered!"}
{"text":"Buyer beware!!!  Watch your credit card charges folks had unauthorized tip charges and get this months later....the kid still works there!!!!  What kind of management runs this place?!?!"}
{"text":"Best acai in the game!!! I come here at least twice a weak!! I'd recommend getting strawberry passion! It's the best!! Great staff and great service!! Nothing better in the Tempe/Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious! Love coming here after visiting the neighboring Planet Fitness. Great spot to stop by on the go."}
{"text":"My family and I come here all the time.  We are addicted to their açaí bowls.  The menu selection is extensive and we don't get bored with the choices.  We try something new each time we visit, and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"I tried this Wednesday night. It was pretty good, but it did take a long time to get our order. I think maybe due to the type of juicers they use. This is nobody's fault, just something to remember if you're in a hurry. My daughter and I sat at a dirty table which should have been wiped down. There was nobody in the store but 2 employees. Keeping it clean and tidy goes well with foods and drinks. The one thing i was not clear on is if these are truly organic fruits and vegetables. I called the next day to ask, and the girl wasn't quite sure. She then consulted with someone who said \"Yes, we get them from Sprouts.\" Well, not all produce is organic at Sprouts. This is important to know and important to announce if you are truly organic. One, it is a huge selling point. Two, some people for health reasons deliberately choose to put only organic into their bodies. I docked a point for dirty tables and not knowing your product thoroughly. I still would like to be clear about if they're truly organic or not."}
{"text":"I stopped coming here because of the inconsistency of the acai bowls and the toppings, I've been to quite a few acai places and for the amount you get and the price you pay is way over priced in my opinion. The staff is a hit or miss too, never know if you'll get someone friendly or someone just trying to collect their paycheck"}
{"text":"I have been hearing about this place for months and I finally made it out there today.  I was finally able to find something that is delicious after my workout and has so many of the nutrients I need for the day.  I am highly recommending this place for everyone."}
{"text":"Decent Acai bowl at a reasonable price. Very minimalist decor.  Somewhat of a wait for our stuff."}
{"text":"Love coming here for açaí bowls (the best I've tried anywhere) and they're fresche green juice!"}
{"text":"Normally have a good experience here, but today I had to wait 30+ minutes for one large acai bowl. I normally come here when i'm hungry & in a hurry but it was nothing quick this time. very disappointed!!!!!!!! won't be back until there's more staff or better."}
{"text":"I've see Acai before but didn't know what it was. Thrive is more than a smoothie bar, the Acai bowls are tasty and better for you than ice cream! The CR500 weight loss program they offer works as well....so far I've lost 15 pounds in  21 days!  Thanks Marcy!"}
{"text":"I had the peanut butter acai bowl and it was delicious. I will be returning very soon. I plan to try all the acai bowls, I'm ready to fill that fresche punch card they gave me"}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.  getting the acai bowls for breakfast is a little early for me to eat something that cold.  

I could see as a lunch option would be perfect on the weekend when you aren't in a hurry because its definitely worth savoring.  

I absolutely love the granola and would take granola and bananas as a topping on these acai bowls any day.

So yummy!"}
{"text":"Update from last Review, don't think I'll be coming back. Found a piece of rubber inside my smoothie. Brought it to their attention and they said, \"oh that's from our spatulas.\" They said, would you like us to give you a new one for next time or do you want me to make you one now? First off, how about you apologize for a piece of rubber found in my drink. Shocking to me but they didn't act surprised. Be careful when you are drinking your smoothies."}
{"text":"Ive gotten a smoothie here a couple of times and they are always really good.  They pack a ton of fruits and veggies into the smoothies, including kale and spinach, but they don't taste like greens.  It's pretty pricey for the smoothies, but I think the bowls are actually pretty reasonable compared to other acai bowl places I've seen.  I wish the menu had descriptions of the smoothies because it would be easier than asking the person working there to tell me the contents of each one."}
{"text":"Juices and acas bowls are good. I come in for the Fresh Greens juice. If this place was served by bots, I'd give it 5 stars.I'm giving it 3 stars because of the Customer service. They are SLOW. It's genuinely fresh think because I'm waiting for the actual greens to grow. 

My advice to you - call ahead and do pickup."}
{"text":"Had the new pitaya bowl and it was great!  The medium size was very filling for a lunch"}
{"text":"If you're used to acai bowls where the acai is semi-frozen and delicious, that's not what you're going to find here. Ours was really runny. Maybe we are biased having just returned from Hawaii where the acai bowls are nothing short of spectacular, but this was really disappointing."}
{"text":"I've never had an Acai bowl before... I didn't know they were in Gilbert also, because I've never been. I really thought the staff was great, the sample I received was amazing and what I ended up ordering (an AMAZING homemade peanut butter acai bowl) was absolutely delicious. I have a feeling I'll be a regular and hope I can recruit as many of my friends as possible to go there. It has a nice atmosphere and felt really inviting. They even have offered me a gluten free option which though I'm not allergic to gluten was really happy about because a couple of my friends are. 

So glad this place is in my area of town and that I stopped in to check it out."}
{"text":"Been a loyal customer for quite some time now, but I got to admit the past few times I've been there the service has been terrible. I usually come on Saturday mornings so I get it, it can be busy. Last week I waited more than 25 minutes for one bowl and then this week my friend and I waited 50 minutes and they never came. Haven't had any issues ordering ahead before so If you do decide to go there... stick with that. They are good when you they actually get to eat one."}
{"text":"Best acai I've had. I been to at least 4 other places in Maricopa county and they have the best flavor"}
{"text":"This place is awesome when it comes to healthy eating. I'm not really a fan of healthy food so when it makes it taste more like a dessert, I was super happy! I got the peanut butter and it was fantastic. The portion are also really good. For $5.00, I was really full and satisfied with what I had. The customer service wasn't the best, they weren't too friendly, hence the -1 star. Other than that, it was a cool place. There are a lot of tables to sit and chat as well, and there are tables outside too. I will be coming again!"}
{"text":"This was my very first time trying an açai bowl and wow was I blown away. I was really craving something sweet but wanted to stay on the healthy side and this completely satisfied me. I will definitely be coming back to try another menu item."}
{"text":"I've visited and few times and have been pretty satisfied. The last time however, I was let down. I ordered the tropical acai bowl after a long time at work, and received a very small bowl with no bananas which were to be included. A little disappointed when I got home since that was what I was looking forward to. i will be back, but will be definitely checking to see that my order is right :/"}
{"text":"Thrive's strawberry passion bowl tasted great! The bowl didn't have much pineapples and strawberries. Most of it was just the blended acai sorbet. Another thing is that the bowl had a lot of honey. I was able to taste the chunks of honey in there. It tasted really sweet, but a lot of unnatural ingredients were being used. I'm down to try this place again if they add more toppings and use more natural ingredients. I want a bowl that's healthier than frozen yogurt."}
{"text":"Thrive = a super healthy bowl of heaven on earth. It is absolutely delicious and filling. If you haven't tried it, you're doing it wrong!"}
{"text":"Wait was ridiculous and the the menu doesn't tell you what is in the smoothie, which I think is very odd for a \"healthy\" breakfast option. The greens smoothie was so sweet it was almost unbearable. My mom ordered one of the acia bowls, which is basically Sorbet ice cream and some fruit. I questioned the waitstaff on the amount of sugar in their products and we were told that there was no added sugars.... which we later found out that she meant there is stevia added to everything. The amount of sweeteners in the menu items is out of control and needs to be toned down. I would not classify anything on their menu as healthy. Thrive Should be listed as a dessert stop.
Ps frozen fruit is not live and raw...."}
{"text":"This is more of a quick update. Prices have gone up significantly in the last several months...as much as $2 per bowl which is significant based on their sizes remaining the same. 

If you're looking at prices online for a \"to go\" order, prepare to pay more. They haven't updated their prices on their website yet. 

The bowls themselves are still tasty. One big issue is their process for making them...especially during high traffic hours. You often end up waiting at the register for minutes before someone comes to help you, and even then, they act so rushed and impatient if have questions about the menu. 

I placed an order over the phone and was told it would be about 20 minutes (which is no problem at all). I planned accordingly, but still ended up waiting for another 20 minutes in the store. That's kind of frustrating. 

Regardless, they do make a great acai bowl...just not the greatest service."}
{"text":"I came here once & absolutely loved what I ordered so much that I came back two more times before work that week. The first time I went in no one mentioned the loyalty program so I don't get credit for that purchase. Although I ordered the EXACT same thing the same way, none of my subsequent visits have I actually received the same thing. Ive been back 5 more times hoping it was just a fluke & nope. I give up there's no consistency & the people they hire don't seem to understand sizing. If I order more add ins they've given me a tiny bowl with mostly only dry add ins and barely edible because it's so dry.  The lid is squished on so tightly I can't even dip my spoon in with out making a mess of toppings falling everywhere. I'm sad. I really fell in love with this place the first time.  Also when you order on the website you don't get credit towards the loyalty program. No one mentioned that either. Learned that the hard way. I won't go back due to the lack of consistency.

Update: It has been 3 months. What's funny is that I now know why they didn't care to respond to my review although they responded to other reviews."}
{"text":"I LOVE Thrive. I go as often as we can. The bowls are mouth watering! My only compliant is that it takes a long time to receive orders"}
{"text":"I love these Acai bowls. But customer service is awful. Plan on waiting every time. Even if you call call in your order ahead of time. Today my coworker called in the order. She arrived probably 15 minutes after making the call/order. When she got there, it took several minutes for someone to even acknowledge her at the counter. Finally after having to ask for help, she said she was there to pick up an order she called in. The order was not even made. So, she had to wait additional time, 10+ minutes. They came out and 1 of the 2 bowls was made wrong. Again, waiting. Seriously people, know how to run your business and hire some staff!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because the acai bowls are good but the staff is incredibly rude. Every time I have been to this location none of the workers have a good attitude and have horrible customer service. Love the acai bowls but the staff makes it really hard for me to want to go back in."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good place to get a juice on the way to do some shopping. The staff was very nice and the overall environment was pleasant. The decor was clean and inviting and made it worth spending 7 bucks on a juice. You can watch them make your order through the glass behind the counter and they use all fresh products. I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 1 star because they are not a juice bar but claim to be on yelp it's such easy thing to change in the yelp app. Drove 8 miles to discover no juice."}
{"text":"I didn't think the acai bowls were that great..I came here twice and had the original and the green bowl. I mean they tasted good it was sweet and refreshing on a hot winter day in February, but I honestly could make the same thing myself but healthier with less added sugar, (and extra spinach/kale and flaxseed) and cheaper (a small came to $5 something). Which is exactly what I did lol. It's just a personal preference thing I guess, for smoothies I always prefer to make them myself cause I know what's going in and how much sugar I'm getting, whereas at Jamba Juice it's like getting sorbet. Same concept for these. Worker was very friendly though."}
{"text":"Got the Original acai bowl. Nice fresh ingredients. Extensive menu. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I've been in here half a dozen times, and the bowls are amazing but the staff and overall experience is the pits. It is a very hit or miss situation with how many people will be ordering, so I understand the need to be lightly staffed, but my friend waited 10 minutes at the register while there was no one else waiting for bowls (i.e. they had no reason to be in the back). We watched the workers gabbing the whole time until they finally decided their conversation was over and they could help a customer. So rude!

To top it off, I paid for gluten-free granola and was given regular granola, which made me extremely sick the rest of the day. Food allergies are a serious thing, and not taking them seriously can lead to serious consequences for customers like myself. 

New staff and better work ethic and I'd be back more often."}
{"text":"Location is small and has a trendy feel to it. Clean and bright.
I was happy that the service was faster than I've had in the past. 
This is a great place to find acai bowls in AZ. 
A little pricey for the portion size to me."}
{"text":"So glad to find this gem. In California it was easier to find an acai bowl. I visit the location on Higley more than Tempe. Thrive does not disappoint, all of their bowls are unique and delicious! 
My only complaint is how long it takes to get your order. Whether you order 1 or 4 items, it always takes forever to get your bowl. 
It's always clean, smells okay, and staff friendly. 
Try this place instead of Jamba Juice people!"}
{"text":"Acai bowls are my newest and truest addiction. Thrive knows how to whip up an amazing bowl! 
    The inside is pretty sparse with the big menus, several tables and a couple of couches and an area to buy powders on display. The colors are loud and fun, kind of like their ingredient combos! 
     The girl at the counter was really nice and the wide window looking in to the back where the kitchen is a cool touch. I ordered the chocolate peanut butter Acai bowl and my friend got their new Pitaya (dragonfruit) bowl. You can get a small, medium, or large bowl and considering how hungry we were we decided on mediums. These are generous helpings for $8! 
   Our bright bowls came out and mine was full of pb, Acai, chocolate pea protein powder, hemp protein, bananas and strawberries. This was rich, filling and oh so good. 
   My only \"negative\" is that they don't have much outdoor seating, when the weather was as beautiful as today everyone would want to sit outside and eat their treats! They have smoothies as well, they look thick and delicious as well, but they have stolen my heart when it comes to bowls!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Thrive? Disappointing. The bowl was delicious but the customer service and the 30 min wait to get a smoothie! That just to much for me. I could of went to Jamba Juice and been home by now. I get that you had a bunch of orders but you need to let people know before they order that it will take that long or my solution-( Higher another person). Time is money. So i guess order for pick up if you must but there is just to many options to bother."}
{"text":"For me, the dealbreaker is that their ingredients are not organic. Their marketing doesn't miss a buzz word to suggest that their products are good for your health, but the antioxidants and vitamins in those berries won't do you much good if they are laced with a ton of toxic pesticides.

Conventional berries are some of the worst offenders in the pesticide department, and conventional strawberries are among the worst of the worst. It boggles the mind how a business that markets healthy eating could be totally oblivious to that.

Switch to organic Thrive, and you might win me back as a customer."}
{"text":"We visited this location after trying the bowls at the Gilbert Farmer's Market and the Gilbert location. The staff was friendly but the bowls weren't very good at all with a completely different consistency then the others. Our orders were packed to go even though we didn't ask for them to be which meant everything was smushed into the bowl and harder to eat with two kids instead of the nicer presentation we have had prior. I think we'll stick with the other location."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and very delicious bowls! 

I called in an order to have it ready ahead of time since it can get so busy and it was ready when I walked in the door. The other two times I ordered at the store, phone orders seemed to delay my order. I'd suggest a better process of completing orders since the wait time can be very long for those in the store if orders keep coming in online/phone."}
{"text":"Acai bowls hand crafted and fresh! Love how clean this place always is, and how consistent the bowls always are. They never skimp on fruit, and the taste is always yummy! Only bummer is the wait time can get a little frustrating."}
{"text":"Since my original review a year ago I've been to Thrive numerous times. The wait time has improved unless you go during lunch hour or at other rush times, I suspect. The Acai bowls are still wonderful but I would say that 30% of the time my order is incorrect and I see that others are having to send theirs back for corrections as well. I think if you plan for a few mistakes ans extra time it's well worth the visit as the atmosphere is pleasant and the bowls are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Always delicious and the biggest selection of acai bowls I've ever seen. They make everything in the back room so sometimes you have to wait till they are done to place an order. Otherwise super friendly and delicious!"}
{"text":"As some people have pointed out- this is pseduo-healthy place. They use acai sorbet (ie a bunch of added sugars)- not actual pure acai. Before realizing this I went numerous times simply because it's around the corner from my gym. The service has always been pretty bleh. Workers are consistently unfriendly (once) even when I try making conversation. As another commenter said- My groupon also screwed me. I also thought that it would be like EVERY OTHER DAMN GROUPON where you still have a remaining balance, nope. And I asked about this too and the worker also told me that was the case. However you had to use the $20 in two visits, each voucher for 10 dollars. I only was buying this for myself. I sure as hell wasn't buying $10 dollars worth just for myself.

The part that gets to me the most:
Pea protein: it's honestly gross. I think that it's great that they offer a unique option but it really annoys me that this is the ONLY protein option they have. I've only tried the chocolate. The thing that scares me is when I asked the employee about the pea protein she said the chocolate tastes a lot better and less aftertaste. You can't taste it AS much in the acai bowls because it has a bunch of stuff in it.
I got the chocolate peanut butter protein shake...disgusting. Literally disgusting and horrible aftertaste and I ended up not even being able to drink it.
I really don't get how that's their only option. 
I also think it'd be nice if they had more green options but this place is pretty much a bunch of fruit with spoons and spoons of sugar on top.

Needless to say I really am not going back. 
Due to  the fact that the service is consistently poor, most everything is unhealthy (seriously...acai sorbet. that doesn't constitute an acai bowl i might as well go to a froyo place), and gross results.
Ugh."}
{"text":"Love acai their bowls... customer service is why im giving this 2 stars.. their customer service game is WEAK. 
They don't give a shit..lol. it shows. 
Berry Divine on Scottsdale road has way better options and customer service, i recommend them.
A smile goes a long way. Just sayin."}
{"text":"THE BEST ACAI BOWLS IN TEMPE! My favorite bowl is the original and the granola is amazing - you can't find it anywhere else! However, if you are in a hurry I don't recommend coming here because it usually takes more than 5 minutes to receive your order...sometimes even longer depending on how many people are there."}
{"text":"I went to Thrive today expecting great things! I had tried an acai bowl in California and it was so good! I was excited to find out there was somewhere near my house that had acai bowls!

When I got to Thrive I ordered a small original bowl, which was $4.50. I then sat down at a table to wait for my order, thinking it would take 5-8minutes to get the small bowl prepared. Well, I ended up waiting 25+ minutes for my small bowl. Ridiculous. There were 4 people working there (at least that I saw) and 2 others in the place waiting for their orders. Why would it take so long to prepare a simple, small acai bowl?!? I have the feeling that the people working at Thrive care more about laughing and talking with their friends in the back (where they prepare the bowls) than actually helping the customers. The employees were not rude or mean but they were definitely not very friendly. 

The bowl itself was nothing spectacular. It was just ok. There were 2 pieces of strawberries and 2 pieces of sliced banana and some granola on the top of the acai. I'm not sure it was worth $4.50. Definitely not worth the 25 minute wait. I will not be retuning to Thrive anytime soon... :("}
{"text":"This place is a great local business that offers acai bowls. They are really tasty and consist of granola, honey drizzled on top, and sliced bananas. My favorite is the peanut butter bowl. My only complaint here is that I cannot afford to come here as much as I want. The bowls are extremely expensive. It's like 8 bucks for a small and they really are...small. maybe someday they can lower their prices a bit."}
{"text":"This place is run by rude teenagers. The orders take FOREVER, the smoothies aren't very good and if they get your order wrong, they argue with you about what you ordered. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I bought a juice with a Groupon I got and even though it didn't work in their system for some reason they still gave me the deal I'd paid for.  And THEN I accidentally dropped my juice all over Sprouts while I was shopping and they gave me another small juice for free to make up for it. 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Yep 2 stars is all this place gets, the entire experience was horrible except for the young lady that took my order.  I was in town for the Tough Mudder event, I wanted something healthy for my husband.  We called multiple times at 830pm, 30 minutes before closing,  no one answered.  We did end up finding it, when the nice little girl that took my order said she was told NOT to answer the phone because it was almost closing time. Hummm, weird but ok. So while I waited for my drink order, I was approached by a small child. The child was in the middle of asking me a question and this rude employee came out from the back holding my drinks,  yelled my name. I looked over raised my hand to show it was me and smiled at the lady so she knew I would be there as soon as the little girl was done asking me her question.  This rude employee yelled my name louder and rolled her eyes. I couldn't believe how impatient,  loud and rude this employee was. No I wouldn't recommend this business,  I would definitely try another juice bar the drinks were not made correctly. Obviously going 30 minutes before closing is not a good idea."}
{"text":"Is a thank you or a smile too much to ask of an employee when someone visits a business? Very disappointing that service is not required anymore from someone taking my money. Not sure I will be back. The drink was OK but the appreciation of a customer was not there."}
{"text":"Great light breakfast or snack anytime. Been a few times with the lady. Fresh made peanut butter is very good and a must add in."}
{"text":"Lots of places are doing the acai bowls now... Thrive just does them right.  I used to work in the area and would visit about once a month. I like to visit whenever I'm in the area now. I usually get the original acai bowl, but if you have questions the staff is pretty good about giving you their recommendations. Only knock, if you can even call it that, would be that it's always kind of warm inside. Not a problem if you're on the run though."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is soooooooo slow. They don't have anything to drink unless you want water from the tap, the tables aren't clean, and the whole place looks like they decorated it in 23 minutes flat. This place is popular the owner needs to invest some money into the experience now."}
{"text":"Genuine Fresche is by far the best açaí in the valley! My favorites are strawberry passion, raspberry lime, and pitaya colada. Unfortunately I don't think these bowls are as filling as I wish they were, but they are super healthy and leave me feeling great after eating it as a replacement for lunch. Because they use only the best ingredients, it does cost a little more than most smoothie shops, but its definitely worth it! 
This location can get pretty busy, so I would suggest calling your order in before you get there. They always have it ready on time exactly how you like it. I think you can also order online. The shop is usually pretty clean and they've done a lot to update it. It's a great little place to meet with friends and hang out for an hour or so. If you are looking to cool off with some açaí, this should definitely be your choice. It's WAY better than Nekter or Jamba!"}
{"text":"Super Yummy & Very healthy!!!! :) Woohoo, Love this place. A little pricey but you get your monk's worth! Delicious & filling with total vibrancy!"}
{"text":"I went during the morning, the manager and the girl working were very nice. Bowl looked and tasted great in the large \"eat-in\" bowl. Only reason I won't give 5 stars was due to my last experience."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here, I am never disappointed. The fruits are always fresh when I get the bowls. My favorite is Just Acai and the Original. The people are always friendly and the service is quick. I mean it does get busy, because it's a pretty popular place but for the most part it's quick service. Oh and I love the fact it's open till 9pm."}
{"text":"I love their bowls! My only complaint is they don't provide nutritional information for their menu items, which makes it extremely difficult when training or on a specific diet. Haven't been able to go back in sometime due to this limitation."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get an açaí bowl. Unlike other smoothie joints this place kindle shields your ears from the insidious ruckus that blending fruit makes. There fruit that tops there bowls is also delightfully frosty but not frozen through like live experienced at other smoothie bars. All in all I found this place to have a wonderfully satisfying sensory experience, it brought joy to my pallet and hopefully it will bring it to yours as well."}
{"text":"Super delicious! I get the just Acai and I'm always pleased. The employees are always nice! Please open on Sundays so I can have more."}
{"text":"First time trying this hype. The place is clean and well maintained. It's a little small but it is very cute. Order took awhile to receive but I wasn't disappointed. It was good. I tried the original one and was happy with all the fresh ingredients. Very good portion size for a small. 

I do wish they have a smaller portion size available because even though I ordered a small, I couldn't finish it!"}
{"text":"Don't let the bland interior fool you, this place has excellent bowls and smoothies and is worth every penny!  I had a bowl of acai frozen yogurt, chocolate protein powder topped with granola and fruit. Not only is this place delicious for a dessert or fruit bowl but it's healthy."}
{"text":"Great acai bowls, incredibly slow service. Plan on waiting at lease 20 minutes for a bowl or smoothie."}
{"text":"I got the chocolate coconut bowl & I was amazed from the beginning. They had amazing service, kind employees, & bowls so good you would go for another if you could. Will definitely be dropping by more often!"}
{"text":"I have come here a few time with my wife and we love it. I was in yesterday 3/4/16 and ordered an original bowl. As I was eating it was super runny and not what I expected. I was skeptical about bringing it up to the employees because I hadn't had that bowl before and thought that it should have been that way but did anyway since the worst they could say is that's the way it's supposed to be. Also I t's always awkward when you have to complain and the employees seemed shocked that I did. I probably would have just eaten my bowl the way it was and not come back for a while but this experience had me wanting to go back! I waited for a new bowl and the girl who brought it out was awesome! She apologized and said that isn't how it should be. She even gave me a gift card. This place turned a bad experience in to a good one and we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The peanut butter acai smoothie was scrumptious and not too sweet, which was perfect for me. However, I don't feel it was worth $7 (12-16 oz?) and the 15 minute wait. There were about 5 customers in the store and everyone seemed to be waiting. Maybe they were short staffed, so it's worth giving them another try and a revised review. Till next time..."}
{"text":"I wish there was a place like this in Denver where I live, but when I'm in Mesa I have every intention of stopping here, I just don't always get time. I got the peanut butter bowl and it was really good. I was there about 3 weeks ago but from what I remember they had a decent selection of acai bowls of goodness. I remember peanut butter, banana, granola and whatever else was in it was so good. It's a somewhat healthy alternative when you want something sweet."}
{"text":"Usually I enjoy stopping by after a workout and getting a protein shake, but these past two visits have been the least pleasant. Yesterday I went in and there was a line. The girl working was obviously overwhelmed and told me it would be a 30 minute wait and she didn't say it kindly either. I work at a coffee shop so I understand busy hours, but to reflect it back the on customers was unprofessional. I left without a drink. Came back today and thankfully it wasn't busy! But yet again another rude girl. She didn't greet me, no smile, just stale face. Then when the customer behind me asked for more of a description on her shake and what's in it, she didn't sound pleasant or happy explaining the product to her. Usually I tip but I didn't this time. Don't know if I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Yummy fresh acai bowls at a great price. 

You can preorder online and pick up at the store. Portion sizes are big! I got a medium sized fresche chocolate peanut butter bowl and I could barely get through half, so filling. I saved my other half for later which was still really good. Pricing is very reasonable for portion size and freshness of the food."}
{"text":"Fresche has never let a customer down! The workers are always quick and kind and will do the job with just the same amount of spirit each and every visit. Even if you come in at 8:59, they never rush and the bowls are always perfectly done. Over many different selections, my favorite is the Tropical acai bowl. Overall Fresche gets a 5 star rating for me."}
{"text":"Given 4 stars for the power shake very good.
The service is very friendly but super slow. There were 5 girls working and I think they spent more time laughing and having fun then making my shake.
20min a little bit to much.
Again they are super friendly just get down to business."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh juices and smoothies the whole family will enjoy! Staff is friendly, prices are fair. My only complaint is that it's such a far drive from my house!"}
{"text":"Their smoothies and bowls are delish and go great anytime of the day. They also sell quest bars (which are freaking amazing) only downfall is when they are busy you can wait anywhere from 15-30 mins to get your order."}
{"text":"Wish I didn't have to downgrade this place...but I recently discovered that the protein powders they use have sugar in the ingredients. My fault entirely for not looking more carefully. There are *numerous* protein powders available on the market that don't use sugar. Why they chose products that do is unfortunate. No more visits for me. :("}
{"text":"Amazing product. Terribly slow service. We have come here and waited over 30 minutes to get two bowls made. We have also walked in waited at the cash register with no one there for a while and just left before. They make great bowls... but t t t today JR!"}
{"text":"After the demise of the Argentinian sandwich shop here, I wondered what business would take the place in this location.  I was naturally intrigued when I found out that there would be a smoothie and acai bowl place opening up in its stead. I think this is a great location for acai bowls, since Sprouts is just a few steps away, bringing in the more health-conscious crowd.  I went in with high hopes of getting a healthy, fruitful bowl.

There are quite a few bowls to choose from, some of them fruity, others more dessert-like, with peanut butter and chocolate.  I opted for a fruitier bowl, getting the tropical.  This was my first time trying an acai bowl, and it was quite tasty.  The bottom layer was a smooth, thick acai puree/sorbet-like mixture, which tasted berry-like.  There was crunchy, sweet granola layered in between the acai and the tropical fruit (Banana, mango, and pineapple), with large, thin shaved pieces of coconut completing the bowl. The granola itself was a high quality mixture, containing ingredients such as flax seed. The bowl was a nice mixture of textures and of tastes.  I ordered a small (About $5), and it definitely filled me up!

Service was very friendly, and they offer a points reward system which uses your e-mail to keep track of your purchases.  The interior is pretty bare-bones, and it seems like they kept much of the same color scheme as the previous owner.

Definitely a good place to go if you're looking for a healthier alternative to dessert, or if you want a lighter (Yet filling) meal for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!"}
{"text":"For a healthier, light lunch, Thrive's acai bowls are a good option for something refreshing and cool in the hot heat of summer. This location is larger than the Tempe one, with more tables for people to sit down and enjoy their bowl or smoothie. I've had every bowl, and my favorites so far are the chocolate walnut, tropical, and cherry."}
{"text":"Great acai place. Cheapest one I've had and it's super delicious. The sorbet itself is thick and not runny like how you see on google images or whatever. If you're not used to it being thick and icy, just wait for it to melt!

I joined the rewards program and pulled up the coupon once to look when it was valid. It never showed up again and I never got an email for a coupon in my email which makes no sense. I'm still unable to get my 50% off which is extremely annoying. Only reason it's 4 stars. 

The wait is a while because everything is freshly made. If you come and order 3-4 things with a group, don't expect it to come out in 3 minutes. 

Thanks for such an affordable option!"}
{"text":"Love this place for their smoothie bowls! The cherry almond is the GREATEST!! it's a little pricey, but worth it, especially if it's in place of a meal! Look for groupon deals."}
{"text":"Wow! First time here and this place is nice.   The smoothies are great I had the berry berry and my husband had the mango passion....both delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here to cure an intense craving for acai bowls, which are the craze in Southern California, but starting to gain traction in Arizona recently. The acai bowls were dense and loaded with acai and frozen fruit. They are slightly skimpy with fresh fruit toppings and the wait time was longer than expected."}
{"text":"It's disappointing that I have to give this place 1 star. The acai bowls are delicious but every time I do an online order it's never ready! This time, I tried to call ahead and place a phone order but I called and called and no answer. I get you guys are busy but if you can't answer a simple call, hire more people."}
{"text":"Well my girls are enamored with this place. They love the product and are prepared to come back often. I personally have only been in twice and found it to be quite nice. It's a relatively small place but appears to be well maintained, clean, and comfortable. There's some seating outside, which is nice for enjoying your cool treat in the beautiful Arizona weather. The service we received was consistent and relatively friendly."}
{"text":"OMG!! I cannot express into words nor articulate the immense amount of PURE JOY I felt running through my veins when I saw there was an acai bowl place right next to my beloved sprouts I frequent more often than I am proud to admit :). I just about flew inside to place my order. I was greeted right away, MAJOR POINTS and feasted my eyes upon the menu -- only wish they had take out menus available, so I could take advantage of their option to call ahead and place an order ( the wait time can be pretty brutal ). You can tell by the inside decor that they are just starting up and have yet to complete their overall vision for the design, but they have a cute comfy couch and a few supplements on the shelf, but needless to say, they offer superb service and a great product, so who really cares if the walls are cream white or sunshine yellow??"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they open and love the original Açai bowl. It's refreshing and the honey drizzle over the fruit and granola makes it just the perfect sweetness.  Sometimes I have it with oatmeal on the bottom and it really feels me up. I wish they were open on Sunday's too."}
{"text":"The chocolate peanut butter bowl was amazing! Great peanut butter taste and the chocolate flavor was rich without being too sweet. 
My husband had the cherry walnut bowl. He said that it was \"damn delicious\". Nice tart flavor and delicious granola.
The restaurant smells funky, but the food is worth the odd smell...!"}
{"text":"Acai bowls are a little bit on the expensive side but soooo worth it watch out though they are addictive my wife doesn't like fruit and even she loves them. If your around you have to stop by and check this place out."}
{"text":"The chocolate coconut bowl is my favorite! Love this place. I could go there every day!"}
{"text":"My bowl is always very delicious! There's only been one mistake, and they fixed it. The only thing is that I always have to wait 5-10 mins for my bowl to come out... there always have people waiting for their bowls too. Prices aren't bad. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Loved my bowl! I stay away from Whey Protein so the fact they use Pea Protein is a huge bonus.

The only con I have is that it took around 25 minutes to get my bowl. Granted it was the rush hour, I believe the reason was lack of employees.

Will be back!"}
{"text":"I had my first acai bowl in Hawaii and I was thrilled to find this place on groupon AND on my way to work!  I have been going once (maybe twice) a week for the last month.  Around my third visit,  the guy at the counter actually remembered how I order my bowl (granola on the side).  I like the straight acai sorbet bowl with bee pollen, goji berries and cacao nibs, my hubby loved the  PB Chocolate!  The service is consistently friendly, there is usually a small wait for your bowl, but it is worth it!  The fresh juices are quite tasty, too!  Warning: acai bowls are addictive!"}
{"text":"Acai is the new froyo?

I joined the line for a free acai bowl mostly because I never queue for free anything and thought my bucket list should include doing so just once.

The atmosphere is sort of the mullet of snack shops: Jamba Juice-like in the front and medical-office-like in the back. For a while in the line, I was worried that I'd accidentally queued for free botox or pedicures or weird treatments that involved cucumbers and mild electric currents.

The acai bowl, when finally achieved, was really good. It's sweet-tart in a refreshing way -- it does actually taste roughly the red-purple shade that it is -- as it's basically a fruit smoothie soft-serve. The five-ounce bowl comes with slices of banana, berries, and a sprinkling of granola that's useful for absorbing the last melted bits of soft-serve. In the relentless sun of suburban Tempe, it has the magic taste of feeling about five years younger, deeply wise and earnest (if not actually in touch with the spirit of yoga masters), and in need of flowing garments with fringes.

When not a free offering, these are ungodly expensive. They're probably also little calorie bombs on the same scale as froyo.

If I were at this shopping center again, I'd have another on my own dime because Tempe is, for me, a vast beige suburban wasteland of dehydration that I need Calories of Refreshing Happiness to endure, and these calories are extremely refreshing and happy. If it were where I change buses on the way home from work, though, it wouldn't be a habitual stop."}
{"text":"I've been here many many times and I have never been disappointed. Everything here is great. I haven't tried all their bowls but the ones that I have have all been really good. My favorites are the Original Acai Bowl and the Colada Pitaya Bowl"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time when they first opened. I then went away and attended BYU Hawaii, and if anyone has ever been to Hawaii, they know that acai bowls are everywhere! Since returning home, I totally forgot about Thrive! until a few weeks ago, and have been returning every week since. It's very yummy and I love the convenient location, but after trying a plethora of different acai bowl places in Hawaii, I might have turned into an \"acai bowl snob.\" A couple suggestions I would have to make this place even better would be to have a sorbet option, where the acai main part is just a little thicker of a consistency. Also, I've had better granola in my acai bowl explorations. But overall, I've had an extremely positive experience every time I've been here, and it's definitely one of my favorite places here in G-town!"}
{"text":"It was my first time and I played it safe and went for the Original bowl and it was amazing! Dragging my friends back and can't wait to try the Raspberry Lime!"}
{"text":"SO FAST! I went earlier tonight and was so impressed by how fast they made my original acai bowl. I've been to the other locations (Thrive) before and this was by far the fastest service I've had when ordering an acai bowl! LOVED IT"}
{"text":"I've become addicted to acai bowls because my sister brought me here while I was in town visiting. The only problem is, I can't find another bowl as good as theirs in Virginia! The consistency of the acai base is just perfect - like a frozen yogurt. The guy at the counter was really friendly and explained everything to me. The coconut chocolate bowl was delicious!"}
{"text":"The first time I had an acai bowl was in Hawaii and they've become quite popular in other cities since then.. The health food industry has grown.  I love the concept of an acai bowl with fresh fruits, granola and whatever else you want to put on top, sweetened with honey.  I had the original acai bowl.. Medium size.  The portion was a good size for the price.  The acai mixture with blueberries and strawberries I believe, was a good flavor.  A little loose in consistency, I wish it was slightly thicker but the flavors were good.  The granola was fresh and crunchy and the fresh fruits were indeed fresh.  It was sweetened perfectly.  I would definitely come back for a nice healthy breakfast next time I'm in Phoenix.  The tropical bowl was also good.. Acai blended with mango and I believe pineapples!  Lots of different bowls to choose from and they come in 3 sizes! Questioning the health factor of the acai sorbet but it tastes good!"}
{"text":"We visited Fresche on a Saturday morning. We arrived at 9:30am and placed our order at around 9:35am. The place was not crowded but there were a few other patrons. 

We waited outside for our order for about 15 minutes with no delivery. We went in and asked and they told us that our order was \"on its way.\"  Still no order. 

We came back outside, and this process continued 2 more times with our order still \"on its way.\"  Throughout this process, multiple people entered the line and RECEIVED THEIR ORDERS before we did. Mind you, we ordered to acai bowls--no special additions and/or changes. 

At 10:20 we had had enough and so we got back in line. We told the cashier we wanted our money back. NO APOLOGY. The girl who had taken our order was back in the kitchen and was confused about why we wanted a refund. Our orders had not even been prepared. 

Eventually, we got our refund but no apology. This was ridiculous."}
{"text":"After visiting a Berry Divine location in Scottsdale, I fell in love with Acai bowls, they were refreshing, visually appealing, and didn't have as much of a guilty sting as ice cream. Because of this, I was excited try Genuine Fresche's acai bowls and had hopeful expectations. The store was cute - it smelled like essence oils and the decorations gave it an organic, down to earth feel. However, the acai bowls I tried were overly sweet and mushy. I had to down a few cups of water and even then ended up throwing away half of my acai bowl... it was far from refreshing and instead, was like a sugary cupcake that I didn't need. I've definitely lost my craving for acai bowls after this ..."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here today and I loved it! There's not too many healthy places to go eat at these days so this was nice! I ordered the chocolate walnut acai bowl and it was perfection. There wasn't anyone else there so our bowls came quickly.  

My only issue was how dirty it was. The tables and floor looked like they haven't been cleaned in a few days. The bathroom wasn't clean either. It's a shame because the place is so small and cute. Swept floors and clean tables would make it that much better. 

All in all I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have heard so many talk about how much they love acai bowls.  I don't have a sweet tooth so I was never so inclined to go try it.  My sister however has a sweet tooth and is on a health binge.  We decided to check this place out for a healthy snack and we were so satisfied and happy! The fruits are super fresh, granola is to die for, and the acai smoothie at the bottom was yummmmy! If you're looking to be really healthy the acai bowl is a good meal replacement."}
{"text":"I haven't been to an eating establishment that has knocked my socks off in some time. I was truly surprised it happened at Genuine Freshe!

Freshly squeezed green juices and açaí bowls are among my favorite healthy snack indulgences (not that I have many healthy indulgences) but I was getting over the flu and was craving some power foods to restore my immune system. 

Ordered a Blackberry Blend bowl and a Clean and Freshe juice. Both blew me away with the quality and tastiness. Neither were overly sweetened and  the portions are generous as well.

Not the fastest place to get juices and açaí bowls but worth the wait for the quality. The staff is very friendly and you could eat off the floor in this place."}
{"text":"Friendly customer service.
Got the Acai Bowl - Small & Peach Passion Pitaya.
The bowls are made with a sorbet adding fresh fruit on top
This place is a nice relaxing bouquet styled hangout.
It's a feel good approach & refreshing appeal.
Cool, healthy & delicious concept!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at this location both times I got a chocolate banana protein shake and an original bowl the first time it was good this time not so much. The Shake is chalky and has a very off taste. When I asked the horl she said they made it how they normally do. There was no offer to rectify the situation. When I stated that it was disgusting and I guess I just wasted my money she just looked at me and said oh sorry. I guess I wont be going back here after all. I am so disappointed!"}
{"text":"I just happened to stumble upon this place when I was in the area and I thought an acai bowl sounded amazing. The server was not very friendly and seemed inconvenienced and annoyed when I asked for gluten free granola instead of their typical gluten-containing granola. Plus, my granola switch cost me an extra dollar in addition to the already overpriced bowl. The wait was long, but the actual bowl turned out to be good. It tasted about the same as Jamba and wasn't anything special, but refreshing nonetheless. I have heard that a lot of people love this place, so I would be willing to give it a second chance in the future. For now, I say just skip this place and go to Jamba - you'll save time AND money!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the bowls are good. However, the atmosphere is unclean and unkempt, especially the restroom. The faucet doesn't even work and the sink is filthy. I don't think they've cleaned it in a long time. It makes me wonder what they do to make the bowls behind closed doors.... And why is it behind closed doors? You're selling health, clean eating, and an experience. Let people see and take part in the experience. Seen Jamba Juice, Bahama Bucks, Cold Stone, etc. Also, the pay counter is a cluttered mess. Again, cleanliness is not a top priority. Move all your point of sale products (except maybe 1 of each item) and pamphlets away so that people can view as their waiting... Cause the wait is long. Nobody is going to hang out at the cashier and read crap. About the wait... We typically go in the morning and the teenage employees always look as if they just got up after a long night out. And then they go behind closed doors and make your bowl........"}
{"text":"Smoothie was more like an acai bowl in a cup. Super pricey for what you're getting. Will try a bowl or juice next time."}
{"text":"Not impressed by this place at all. Honestly, I had pretty high expectations because a few friends of mine really like it here. 

I got the Go Green bowl which sounded amazing, so I was pretty excited. It surprisingly took awhile before I got my order and I was the only customer there. All you have to do is blend the fruits together and add toppings. There were 2 people working in the \"kitchen\" and one in the front. Oh wait, one working in the kitchen and one was just on her phone. 

Anyway, I took my food to go and was pretty excited, but when I took my first bite I realized... This bowl doesn't have much taste! Seriously, all the blend was BLAND. I don't know why! Also, the strawberries on top, though the were few, were too ripe. I like a nice tart strawberry on top of my bowl to balance the sweetness that would have came from the blend and the honey on top. One positive, the granola is delicious!"}
{"text":"Eh. Not really understanding all the amazing reviews. 

Me and the Hubby ordered bowls. They were ok. Nothing special. We have had our fair share in Hawaii. 

I didn't like the store set up. Making the bowls in the back? Weird. Plus the store was filthy! Fruit smeared on a chair, dirty tables, even the kid that helped us his apron was so dirty. Yuck! 

I probably won't ever go back, it was expensive and just so so. The amount of dirty just turned me off."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for acai bowls. Staff is friendly, bowls are flavorful and generous, usually don't have to wait too long, not horribly expensive. The peanut butter chocolate bowl gives me life. The only things I'm not a fan of is how dumpy and dirty the inside of the store is. I never see anyone here, the place could stand to have a good cleaning/repainting!!!"}
{"text":"Great prices! Great size. You're definitely getting your dollar worth! Will definitely be coming back. Service can be a little faster though!"}
{"text":"Reluctantly I entered this place that smells like bad breath bit I had a Groupon requiring me to use $20 in two visits.  When the cashier marked my voucher redeemed, I brought it to his attention that I had a balance and he said that during my next visit I can redeem the remaining balance.  During the second visit this same cashier was not available.  The cashier working said he could not help me since my voucher said redeemed on my phone even after I explained what the previous cashier said he would honor the remaining balance.  He could have tried it but wasn't willing to.  Working through Groupon to resolve this. I hope they can help.  BTW be sure to see how much sugar is in their smoothies and frozen Acai bowls.... Yikes!!!"}
{"text":"After an incredibly long day I decided to stop by this place on the way back home to try one of their 'meal-replacement' sized frozen treats.

  Chocolate coconut - XL ($10). Tasted just as I had imagined... Very flavorful and satisfyingly smooth and cold.. Could qualify for a light meal replacement, though I could imagine getting add-ons like granola or oatmeal would enhance that.

  Will be back to try the peanut butter variety, thumbs up!"}
{"text":"So glad I discovered this place! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is due to the size of this place. Great service, amazing bowls but man, the soccer moms with their brood running around screaming really killed the mood."}
{"text":"I am obsessed! I have been here two days in a row :) I had the peanut butter bowl and the original - I like them both! The staff is friendly and helpful. I like the vegan options of snacks they sell too (especially Lenny & Larrys Complete cookies :) I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"So id been hearing a lot of hype about this place recently and since I'm trying to be healthier I thought I'd try it out! I ordered the original acai bowl and since I don't like granola I substituted it for coconut and also added goji berries and let me tell you it was fabulous!! The only downside is i did have to wait a bit but it was well worth it because you really can tell everything is super fresh and really that's all I can about. I will definitely be making the drive out to this place again."}
{"text":"Small shop, nearby, and I was a very hungry vegan. Ordered two smoothies with companion. Smoothies were delicious however they cook 30 minutes (yes, really) to make. We had ordered small sizes and it seemed like so little for such a long wait. There were at least three staff working and only two other tables.

Disappointed."}
{"text":"Got a small chocolate coconut fresche bowl. Very tasty, fresh ingredients, I could easily eat a gallon of this stuff. 
Service was quick and the staff very friendly and welcoming"}
{"text":"This place definitely has the best acai bowls I've ever had! So so yummy! However, I gave it three stars because they have HORRIBLE customer service. There is only one girl who works there who is nice to us, and all the other people are so rude. We continue to go back for the yummy bowl, but wish they would hire some nicer people."}
{"text":"It's a smoothie, in a bowl, so more frozen, with nothing but GENUINELY healthy ingredients, but it doesn't taste \"eww, healthy\"  !!   Yes, it is somewhat more expensive than ice cream or a frozen yogurt, but it really is due to the quality of ingredients. NO fillers, no dairy, no sugar, no \"fake\" sweeteners... your body will truly thank you.   
And really, you have to get a BIIIGGG bowl with lots of extra stuff to get the price up over $10... It would be a serious M E A L ...."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped in here on a Saturday morning for a quick smoothie. The Smoothie tasted great, but a couple of interesting things... it was cheaper per ounce for the smallest smoothie than it was for the medium and large smoothies. 12 oz was $4 dollars, but the 16 oz medium was $6 ($2 for only 4 oz more) and a large 24 oz was $8.50. Usually it's cheaper per ounce as you go larger, right?  Weird pricing."}
{"text":"Come here to get an amazing ACAI BOWL. So many different flavors of delicious smoothies and shakes. My favorite is the original. It's a blend of strawberry blueberries banana ACAI Sorbet, and apple juice. It's topped with granola, strawberries banana, blueberries, and honey. Can't go wrong. I love their punch card system. Every 10 bowls bought you get a free medium and they're so filling. ENJOY"}
{"text":"I was so excited that this place opened up close to me. My wallet on the other hand is a little nervous. As it should be! This place offers delicious acai, compelling me to go every week. They have a ton of flavors, which I have never ever seen before. Trust me, I have had a lot of acai in my days. The flavor is perfect. Not too sweet not too tart and they don't add a ton of apple juice to dilute it. It is heaven in a bowl topped with bananas, granola, and a hint of honey.  If you have something against bowls, you can get their smoothies. Did I mention acai is full of antioxidants? Plus last time I was there they told me if you are an AT STILL student you get 10% off your order."}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite places to grab lunch, breakfast, or a healthy snack after the gym.  We were first told about Thrive! Acai Bowls and Smoothies by some friends and decided to check it out.  Well, I can clearly see why people will wait or line up for these frozen treats- they are absolutely delicious!  Even if you aren't a \"health- nut\" or more of an icecream person, I would be surprised if you didn't think their Acai bowls weren't amazing also!  My wife is obsessed with the Raspberry Pecan with Hemp Protien and our little 2 year old loves the original.  It's nice that they also offer so many different sizes and variations on the current menu classics.  The only downside is that we don't have a location across the street from our house because we seem to crave them every day.  For anyone out there who wants to try something new, and healthy check this place out!  They have seats inside and an outdoor patio also.  We love this place!"}
{"text":"Just had a smoothie here and it was very tasty - berry berry. I did notice that the store is not very clean, though. Restroom was not clean and the floor of the establishment was not clean. That makes me think that the kitchen area may need some attention also. May give it another try in the future."}
{"text":"A-MAZING! I chose the Just Acai bowl and have not looked back! It's was so good! I will be making this a regular stop on my way to work from now on. Because let's be honest, is there anything better than clean healthy food that's cool and refreshing during the warm, then ridiculously hot summer days in the beautiful state we call home? So I must insist you visit them, and bring along a smile because they will have one for you!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to thrive (what is was called before the name change) for a while because you got a good amount in your bowl for the price. However, the recent price and quantity changes have upset me. No matter if it's to go or you are eating in the store, the sizes are the same. Maybe customers were complaining about smaller to - go orders, but you tended to get more toppings and acai when you ate in the store. The prices are too high for the amount you are getting now. Still great tasting bowls, but I've been looking to take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Organic, full of antioxidants, and just refreshing and delicious! Thrive has 15 different acai bowls to choose from and also has smoothies! Today I had the Go Green bowl and it was so tasty. I always feel so refreshed after eating here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I am more and more impressed every time I visit! I usually order the tropical with a little extra granola, my fav!! The girl who helped me out (Tara) was so incredibly nice and she seemed to take a genuine interested in how my day was going. The bowls take a little longer than you'd think but then again you can't rush good food! When I received my bowl tara dropped it off for me and was so courteous and kind! I will definitely recommend this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"I love thrive so much!!! The bowls are delicious and the staff is super friendly and nice. I have noticed that some people made the comment that you can't see what they are doing because they go behind a close door. Well I'm pretty sure that is why that made a HUGE window on the side so you watch them make your bowl :) I love it because you can actually have a conversation unlike Jamba Juice where's the blenders are extremely loud. my favorite is the tropical but the strawberry passion is also really good! If I don't have the time to wait 10 minutes for my bowl (because they use all fresh ingredients) I call ahead my order and they usually always have it ready for me! Love love love thrive!!"}
{"text":"This is not the place to come if you are in a hurry. Sometimes it takes 5-10 minutes for someone to come out and take my order, and another 10 to actually get my bowl. The food is good, but I get impatient. Also, the staff comes across as though they don't want to be there and are not friendly. Overall, good food but the service is a turn off."}
{"text":"I love love love the Acai and pitaya bowls here! I can not say enough good things about the delicious bowls! BUT, the reason they get 2 stars is because the employees here are so rude! No matter what you order they are just rude as hell. They act like if you change one thing you are putting them out. Unfortunately I have an oat allergy so I order mine with no granola and every time I order it that way they act like I'm ordering something crazy. I love this place but I have a hard time wanting to go here just because I don't like being treated like crap by the employees. I think they need to be reminded that they are being paid to do a job and part of that job is customer service. I hope the management sees the other customer reviews and talks to their employees."}
{"text":"A co-worker of mine sent me a link to this restaurants website, and since she knows that I am trying to eat more \"healthy\", recommended this place as a healthy alternative for lunch.  So after about a week and half of hemming and hawing, I finally decided to give the place a try.

I ordered a regular raspberry, pecan bowl, with pea protein, whey protein, and extra granola . . . won't lie . . . thought it was kinda pricey for what I ordered . . . over $10.00.
Since the place is extremely small . . . three tables and a two seat bar counter inside, and two table outside . . . and with no place to sit, I got my order to go.

30 MINUTES LATER . . . My order finally was ready . . . definitely needs more than two people working and more seating if this place is going to be successful . . . even the UPS man who was delivering a package left after 10 minutes of not even being acknowledged.

Oh well . . . after a short trip back to the office, I sat down to enjoy my acia bowl . . . and I was pleasantly suprised . . . I was really, really good.  Very tasty, just the right balance of smoothness, crunchiness, and sweetness.

Will I be back . . . probably . . . but if all of the seating is taken, and / or there are people waiting in line to order . . . I will probably go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I Loved the chocolate peanut butter bowl I ate when visiting Thrive! They have a great selection of bowls, and other yummies to choose from. My kids (who are VERY picky) LOVE going here, and cant wait for the next visit! The Staff is very friendly, and very informative in regards to Thrives other services available...check them out :)"}
{"text":"People that work in this place are super nice ordered the chocolate peanut butter protein shake and it was bomb will be back again if I'm in need if a healthy snack that is still delicious"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times, and I love it ... with a reservation. The food here is refreshing on a hot summer day. The bowls are cold and tasty; a great refreshing meal when it is 100+ degrees outside. I suggest the tropical or the strawberry passion bowls. OR the Chocolate Peanut Butter! To be honest they are all good ... when it's made right; and there's my reservation. They don't seem to be consistent. Usually, the bowls are packed with fruit and are very tasty. Sometimes however, it's like they are running out of toppings and are giving you scraps. I have had a bowl or two that were mainly an Acai filled bowl with some toppings thrown in there sparingly. This not only makes the bowl look like half of what it should be at full price, giving me the feeling I have been ripped off; it also throws off the flavor of the bowl as a whole. 

If this place could make these bowls consistent, then I would rate this place a 5. Consistency though, is very important. It's amazing place with great food! Although, I shouldn't have to worry about if my bowl will be the same as it was yesterday."}
{"text":"I'm really glad I found this place so close to home! It's a cute and trendy little location with friendly staff. The atmosphere is just like you'd expect, chill and modern. 

I played it safe this time and had their original açai bowl. I have to say, I wasn't disappointed. It was fruity (which is to be expected) and sweet. The granola added a perfect crunch and the fruit that topped it off was deliciously ripe. The only tiny complaint I had was the amount of granola, which can be easily fixed for next time. I'll just ask for less!

All in all, the service was great and the bowl was delicious. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Big news: there is now a Tempe location of Thrive. So if you've been dying to go, but Gilbert is too far away, you now have no excuse. Go immediately. Even if you don't live near Tempe either, it's worth the trip. And even if you've never heard of Thrive or acai bowls, you should still go.

Whether you are a superfood enthusiast or so clueless about this stuff that you think it's pronounced ah-kay, you will not regret going to Thrive. (Its ah-sigh-yee by the way.)

I, a vegan, took my Big-Mac-eating boyfriend, and we ordered a chocolate peanut butter acai bowl. I immediately loved the think, creamy, rich taste and texture of the acai blended with homemade peanut butter and pure cacao topped with fresh fruit (never frozen at this place, don't worry) and simple, crunchy granola. Although my boyfriend insisted that he wouldn't like my \"weird vegan stuff\", we were definitely fighting over the last few bites. So go immediately, and drag as many friends as you can.

Side note: even though it's a bit pricey, it's because the ingredients are such high quality. And as an added plus, they have a rewards system, so GO NOW. And as often as possible."}
{"text":"Really good smoothies and Acai bowls. The downside is its almost impossible to go there on a break, they take forever!!!

Changed this from a 3 star to a 4 because i thought about it and the owner lady was very nice and doesn't deserve less."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Acai bowls for a while and I was glad to find Genuine Fresche. My friend and I usually meet up here during the day. Both the one in Gilbert and Chandler are equal distances from my house but this location looks much cuter!

I always get the small bowl but I never finish it so portion sizes are great. I'm just a bit bummed how it's all crammed in a small cup; it doesn't look very appealing to me. It would be great if they offered the choice to eat in or a cup to go.

I recommend Genuine Fresche!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on living social and wanted to try it. I was pretty impressed. Thrive has a pretty diverse menu, with options of Acai bowls, smoothies, Acai pops, and a variety of optional add-ins (more protein etc) should you want them (although I'd argue that you don't need any add-ins, the defaults are more than enough!) Prices were pretty reasonable for what you get, and they offered a good variety of sizes. Since mine was dinner, I went for a medium, but should probably have gotten a large (it was THAT good).

I was really excited by the fact that they make their own peanut butter, so I got the peanut butter bowl. It was similar to Jamba Juice's fruit toppers, but tasted much more natural and flavorful (probably because it was). I really liked that there was no added sugar and all ingredients were fresh and healthy. I also saw that there is an option to add oatmeal if you want, and I think it said it was free - I'll have to consider that next time.

The owners were really nice, and explained everything to me. I assumed the chocolate bowls would be less healthy, but was quickly corrected. Apparently the chocolate bowls are made with protein powder, and thus much healthier than your normal chocolate bowl. ;) I'll have to come back for that one.

All in all, I prefer Thrive to Jamba Juice, especially since I'm a big fan of health, local business, and unique food places. I'll definitely be back, and  bring friends."}
{"text":"Their mediums are huge! I couldn't even finish mine. 

Came here on a Saturday early evening, around 5. No one in line in front of us, but it still took a good 10-15 minutes to get our bowls. Not the end of the world, but slightly inconvenient. 

Once we received them, though... 

I got the Tropical and the mister, the Original. I think I might have liked mine better, but his was pretty tasty as well. Delicious granola. Super sweet, but only natural sugars. When we were waiting, we saw one of the girls leave with a bunch of reusable grocery bags, and come back from Sprouts about 20 minutes later with two bags completely full. Their fruit is definitely fresh. 

We'll be back, and order smalls next time."}
{"text":"Customer service is great, the smoothies and bowls are delicious, and it's a nice, cool atmosphere. My favorite acai bowls are \"Go Green\" and \"Original\". The food is healthy, yummy, and affordable! I recommend it to anyone, any age!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this spot! I stopped in for a bowl on my way to work this morning and loved it! I'll be back to try out other flavors. The Original, obviously is awesome, but a few other recipes sounded tempting, too! Thanks for a guilt-free breakfast option in a shopping center with Taco Bell and a bagel place."}
{"text":"I LOVE acai bowls!! Last few times at Thrive the bowls have been super runny and it's so dirty inside! Won't ever go again. Nektar is way better, clean and consistent!"}
{"text":"Nice place close to my house.  I've had their açai bowl and it is very good. I do wish that they would open earlier in the morning so I could stop by for breakfast before work. I would definitely go there more often if they expanded there early morning hours. It is clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"THRIVE...IN TEMPE?! As in, we don't have to make a weekly voyage to Gilbert for a bowl of all things pure and wonderful? I'll eat to that. Their expanded menu, simplified bowl sizes, and convenient location are all improvements from the original location, which was already worthy of copious amounts of praise.

If you don't know what an acai bowl is, use the appeal of the mystery to transport yourself there. If you do know, be warned: Thrive beats the Brazilian version, the SoCal version, and everything in between when it comes to mastering the acai bowl. Addiction is definitely in your future.

With flavors like blackberry walnut, chocolate coconut, and every super-food add-in under the sun, it's no wonder this college-town newcomer is already a total hit amongst hippies, hipsters, and sorostitutes alike. With enough support, perhaps my ultimate dream of Thrive running every crappy FroYo place into the ground might just come true."}
{"text":"Thrive! has been on my to-do list for many moons... after all, it's the only place to get an acai bowl within an hour of Scottsdale. I finally made it down to Gilbert this morning, and now I hate myself for not discovering the glory of Thrive sooner (but really, I love myself, because I just had a giant acai bowl and am feelin' fine).

My favorite thing about Thrive is the ingredient selection, which tops anywhere I've been in California. They even beat out Sambazon's Acai Cafe, which is 100% build-your-own bowl style. Yes, there's a menu, but many a secret ingredient hides in the kitchen, including super foods like cacao nibs, goji berries, spirulina, maca powder, hemp and chia seeds. Other highlights include homemade nut butters, protein powders, all kinds of berries and tropical fruit, and hemp-flax or gluten-free granola.

I'm too excited by any restaurant's build-your-own option to order a set menu item, and given the myriad possibilities laid out before me... I knew the original bowl wasn't going to cut it. I made my own acai blend (spirulina, cacao nibs, chocolate protein powder, banana, and walnut butter) and topped it off hemp-flax granola, walnuts, and chocolate shavings. AY. DIOS. MIO. Too delicious for English words... and five hours later, I'm still full.

The owner was even sweet enough to let us try free samples of the tropical, chocolate peanut butter, and chocolate coconut bowls... which were unsurprisingly scrumptious. Overall, I'm left with these two thoughts: 1) Even if Thrive is 25 minutes away, I've got plans to fill out my punch card and get a 10th bowl free before the end of the month, and 2) Why is there only one of these? Time to start replacing Scottsdale's 473 crap-tastic FroYo places with acai cafes!"}
{"text":"A must have!!!! Reminds me of the beach in San Diego!!!!!  Just acai!!!!!! They carry vitamins and protein etc also.  It was really good!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Super fresh! Super delicious!!!! I tried them for the first time earlier this week after a workout and was so satisfied! The girls working were super nice and helped me pick a bowl after I told them I was a newbie! A must try for anyone interested in a yummy, healthy treat!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this shop for a while now and I'm always impressed with how good everything is. The Power Shakes are really, really good, but I think my favorite is the Original açaí bowl. Plus, the staff is always very friendly and pleasant. I've also met the owners and they are super sweet."}
{"text":"I am addicted to this stuff. I've tried many of the acai bowls and loved each one. It's just fresh and yummy. Really quite filling with the granola on top. I've had them for meals sometimes. The small bowl is enough to make me full but if you want to try it at a meal, I'd bump it up to medium. Large is way too much for one person!"}
{"text":"I really liked the Peanut Butter Bowl! Everything was extremely fresh and delicious! The only downside was the wait for the order, but it was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming her after I workout at the gym. The cold bowls are very refreshing and my fav is the raspberry lime. The only bummer is-when I see a little line I want to turn around and leave because I know it's going to take FOREVER! Please hire more people!"}
{"text":"Traveling for work and needed something quick and healthy to hold me over until I could eat dinner.  The smoothie I got was both tasty and filling.  I always appreciate a place that offers fresh, healthy vegan options."}
{"text":"I LOVE GENUINE FRESCHE! For one- I love that they have a loyalty program! Although it's a little pricey, you get large sizes! I always get the chocolate coconut bowl when I go, and it fills me up so fast. Staff are always so nice and really quick, even when there's a line of people. I would highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Guilt free dessert (meal) is here! Depending what size I get and the type, it has served as a meal replacement before, especially the peanut one. 

I've tried the Go Green and the Peanut Butter. Go Green was fruity and refreshing, just what I was looking for whereas on my second visit I decided to go nuts! :) So I ordered the Peanut Butter and though it was good, it was SO filling. It wasn't compelling to eat more than a few spoonfuls in one sitting. 

I'll be back for the Go Green or to try others. All in all the granola, acai blend and fresh fruit is pimp."}
{"text":"The store wasn't hard to find at all, it's in a spot where a lot of yogurt businesses have been in the past. I love acai and I can be a little picky because I've had some pretty good experiences else where. Well, I got the original acai bowl (medium) was what I ordered. It was alright, nothing too special. It was also $9.... So... Other than that the staff was friendly and they made the bowl pretty quick. I'll maybe come back and try the smoothies."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The acai bowls and juices are my go to! Very friendly staff and the inside is cute as well."}
{"text":"Nothing negative to say about this place except, I live extremely far away from it and I would kill to something..anything this good out in Florence, got a power shake with blueberries, almond butter, some veggie protein powder and some other goodies, it was perfect and very filling, pricing is great, friendly staff, will definitely keep going even though I live far away."}
{"text":"I've never tried an Acai Bowl before. I found this place on yelp and decided to try it on a whim. The young lady at the counter was friendly and knowledgeable. I tried the Go Green bowl because she said that's one of her favorites. I'm glad I took her advice. It was delicious and affordable. Under $6 for a small (yet filling) bowl and a bottled water. The place has a nice laid back atmosphere with good music playing. I'm definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"This place is so much better than nektar, and I honestly think the bowls are better. I always get the Peanut Butter bowl and it's the best. One of the girls who works here is my fav! She's always so nice and friendly. Overall I really like this place"}
{"text":"I ordered the peanut butter acai bowl . It was very satisfying. The fruit was fresh and sweet . The place was clean & service was fast friendly & welcoming . This is close to work so I will visit more. The only thing I don't like is it doesn't open until 8 am. Im 2 hours or more already into work."}
{"text":"Wow.....really gross. This place probably isn't that healthy, actually. The person taking my order told me there is sugar in the vanilla whey, for instance. I was charged extra to replace the vanilla whey with regular whey. What I ended up with was not edible, so I choked half down then tossed it. This is from someone with a very high tolerance for eating less than palatable foods for the sake of health. You shouldn't have to have a bunch of extra sugar for something to be edible. The place had a really weird, negative atmosphere, too."}
{"text":"This place is awful it should take about 1 minute to make an acai bowl and I've been waiting 25 minutes for mine I'm mushing don't come here unless you're prepared to wait a long ass time for your order"}
{"text":"Not my favorite Acai bowl but my husband liked it. I think I expected it to taste like my favorite smoothie bar in WA so I was disappointed with my first bite. 

Let's start with the actual bowl, in my opinion it should be clear so you can see exactly what's inside. Also, it was very messy and was all over the outside of the bowl. 

Now to the important part, the Acai smoothie had too much additional flavors mixed in with the actual Acai that you could not even taste Acai. It would probably make a good smoothie? Also, tons of granola which I'm sure some people would not mind. Topping selection was fair.

Looked pretty and close to our house. I would give it another try and try something else. The hunt continues!"}
{"text":"Acai bowls are good, I just wish they'd freely post their nutritional information."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place I even bought a groupon their peanut butter chocolate acai bowl is to die for !"}
{"text":"I was here at 9 and according to Yelp and Google, they were \"Open\". According to the locked door and the stacked chairs they were not open. I guess I'll wait around a while...

Doors opened at 10 after and didn't get my bowl until 9:35 due to the one employee and line of 20 people. I think I'll pass on coming to this location. The Gilbert one has plenty of help and seems to open on time."}
{"text":"Ok, so I finally tried their acai bowls and they're AMAZING as well!  I especially love the Strawberry Passion, Go Green, and Raspberry Pecan!"}
{"text":"I came in & ordered a medium \"just acai\" bowl & it took over thirty minutes for me to get it. There were two girls working & they had everyone waiting at least thirty minutes after they had ordered to get their stuff. I get home & the acai that I ordered just as it comes had some type of powder mixed in like protein powder or pea powder. I know because I've ordered the regular bowl multiple times & ive also tried it with the added powders. I called back to let them know & to see if they would fix it in any way & they just said no there's nothing they can do the girls were new & sorry."}
{"text":"I love these Acai Bowls. I start my day off right with the frozen concoction of blended fruit topped with granola, fresh fruit and of course honey.  The girls are really sweet who work here and Ive lost a ton of holiday baggage with Thrive."}
{"text":"The smoothies were just ok.  My 'gripe' is with the cleanliness of the store.  Front door and windows were filthy, inside and outside trash cans were overflowing, and the seating area was a mess.  All tables, some of the chairs and the floor had crumbs all over them.  The girl in front didn't seem to notice or care about the mess and was busy stocking the drink case. No employees showed any sense or urgency or pride in the appearance of their work place.  It was not busy at all...made me wonder what the food prep area was like.  Will not return."}
{"text":"A friend took me here for the first time yesterday and I absolutely loved it! There's only one problem... there's not one close to me! :( I was in chandler for work but live in northwest Peoria. Please consider coming west!"}
{"text":"The bowls are delicious & very fresh! However, I'm new to the area and been a couple times and the customer service is nothing to \"write home about\". I've tried to converse and be extra friendly, however, no one there has been too friendly back. They are very quick though!"}
{"text":"Amazing açaí bowls, but inconsistent customer service. Some of the employees are curt and cold, like they'd rather be anywhere but here."}
{"text":"They have great acai bowls, and a great reward system but WOW do the girls here hate their job. I understand the food industry is tough, and it's a lot of physical labor but these girls are never happy, they never greet you when you come in. I had a coupon and I could just tell the girl was annoyed because it took an extra 30 seconds to input the code. I worked in customer service and yes I had my bad days, but I've never seen the people in here happy. I don't know if it's the manager, because the crew usually ends up working alone usually or what it is, but I would much rather go elsewhere for good customer service."}
{"text":"The other reviews are pretty on-point: I got the Original bowl, medium sized. Strawberries, blueberries, granola and honey. It tasted fine and was refreshing, but nothing extraordinary. What really put me off was the service, as others have mentioned. I understand high school kids aren't always on their game when working a job like this - I've been there! But they moved slowly and seemed disinterested at best. I waited almost 30 minutes for my food and finally had to ask since my order had apparently gotten lost? An employee brought it out soon after I said something, but they seemed baffled that I was slightly displeased it had taken so long. I'd probably go back if I was in the vicinity but won't go out of my way again to make it back here."}
{"text":"There can never be enough great things said about a place that serves healthy food that taste so great. I stick with the original bowl but have tried a handful of others, the tropical comes in a close second. Great now I'm hungry.  Love me some Thrive!

Once upon a time there were naughty unfriendly ladies working the counter. I'm pleased to report most of the gentleman that work here are pleasant but girls be warned the chicks are not the friendliest."}
{"text":"I had a choco protein shake. it was good.
my complaint is that this place is not clean.
the guy who took my order was wearing a filthy apron."}
{"text":"All the bowls r great. You gotta be patient tho cuz it does take a little while to get your food. I recommend calling before so by the time you get there it's a short wait. But everything they have is pretty awesome."}
{"text":"I really love this place and that they use all organic ingredients. They are always friendly and have the best bowls. I lived in Hawaii for awhile and used to get fresh acai bowls all the time so I was glad to see these bowls on the main land. The only complaint I have is that sometimes I get my bowl and there is not very much fruit or other toppings. It has happened a few times but consistent. But other than that love this place!"}
{"text":"Location: it is a small shop with 4-5 tables in it. Overall it is very clean and cozy to hang out with a few friends at night. 

Service: friendly. 

Food: for those of you who like healthy eating, they have a great selection of items that you might like. Most items have lots of filters and fruits in them.  

Rating: I'll come back here again to try something else."}
