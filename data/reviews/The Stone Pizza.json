{"text":"After reading some positive reviews on local facebook groups my wife (pizza lover) and I decided to place a take out order on Saturday evening. 

My order the bamm-bamm with salami,red pepper and mushroom was very enjoyable and the second pizza..The margarita also excellent!!

Good value at $12-13 each and a pretty big eat for that price.. tasted as fresh as if it had been ordered to a table as opposed to a delivery.

Drop one star for the no appetiser option or condiments but overall very very decent pizza!!

Thank you Stone Pizza!!"}
{"text":"Helder from Prohibition fame opened up his own pizza shop in a quiet neighbourhood.  Nice open space that has some interesting plans for the future.  

I just stopped by and grabbed a Don Ho (Hawaiian).  Great price, decent size, and a very nice pizza.  Nicely done."}
{"text":"The owners delivered me a badly needed pizza on new years day when I was suffering some I'll effects of the night before. The food was delicious and the staff are awesome. I definitely recommend sitting out in the sunshine on the benches with some pizza and watch the world go by."}
{"text":"Maybe the worst pizza I've ever had. The ingredients were extremely fresh-I'll give them that. But the margarita was flavourless and boring, with no visible bocconcini."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good. But it is hard to eat here when the original creator is Mathew Stone. Now that there is a new owner Yogi, the owner who did the original delivery. It was even nice that there was Over The Moon bake shop there (who would donate bake goods to the neighborhood church), in till the owner tried to quadruple the rent for them. The service is not at the same level as it once was. Sometimes pizza is filled with the cheaper ingredients, then all toppings evenly and the openings and closing times and days are always changing.

I don't like speaking bad about neighborhood restaurants, but I like to see the same quality all the way through, not lowered, for the same service."}
{"text":"Sat outside with a slice of the Margarita. My son had a slice of the \"Bamm-Bamm\"....salami, mushroom and sliced tomato. 

Great feel, great location and stunning pizza. 

The margarita was lively, fresh, tasty, tomato-ey with fresh basil and balsamic drizzle, 10/10. 

The report of the Bamm-Bamm was \"best I've had in some time\". This is a guy that eats a lot of pizza. 

They take cash only and I didn't ask about delivery. 

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've ordered three times from here it's great my favourite pizza is there Bam Bam they take cash only and will deliver by foot if you live within walking distance."}
{"text":"Wanted to try all their pizzas by the slice but they didn't have any available. You'll have a better chance of buying a slice during their busy hours. The owner said he could do a half and half so we ordered a 1/2 Don Ho (pineapple, spicy capicolla, house cheese blend, chili oil and tomato sauce) and 1/2 Margherita (roma tomatoes, red onions, fresh basil, bococini & basalmic drizzle). The toppings were delicious but the cheese was scant and the sauce was meh. The pizza crust was a thin crust that had crunchy edges. I would come back if they had individual slices available so I could try the other flavor combos."}
{"text":"This place probably has the best pizza in the area.  And so cheap!! The only shame is that I love to eat dinner super late and they close at 8pm, so if you want their pizza for dinner Plan ahead!"}
{"text":"Have ordered delivery twice from here and both times been really happy with the quality of the pizza for a very reasonable price. I ordered the Choker and the Apple Jack - both delicious and not at all greasy. Quick delivery too!"}
