{"text":"La crêpe aux pommes est tout simplement délicieuse.  Service chaleureux, menu simple mais qui est très satisfaisant, carte de drink très intéressant.  Un nouveau coup de cur assuré."}
{"text":"Delicious food with a vegetarian bent, great service including a nice cocktail menu.  Nice ambience and fairly quiet sidewalk seating made this a great summer restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Awesome service, great cocktails, great food.  They had really interesting and delicious options for vegetarians and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"absolutely delicious. interesting, well-thought out flavour combinations, great ambiance, excellent drinks. highly recommended"}
{"text":"Been to this place twice for Sunday brunch and really enjoyed it. Service is friendly and efficient. Nothing pretentious, just good people doing a good job to keep us customers happy. Food is excellent and gives you many vegetarian option and ways to include meat if you want. I like the Saint Barbara inspired decor."}
{"text":"Santa Barbara is a great brunch. This should be a 5 stars review and it's only a 4 because of the (long) wait. Besides the wait, I loved everything about this place. Fresh and delicious food, a little bit more original than usual brunch fairs. To find out more, check out my review: https://delifeed.ca/2016/05/01/santa-barbara-fresh-and-creative-brunch/"}
{"text":"Ce petit resto a une super ambiance, le menu est court mais original et très savoureux! Conseil d'ami : réserver, ça se remplit vite!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better ambience. We had the mezza platter, kale salad and ratatouille. All three were excellent and complemented each case other very well. The food is simple and fresh and the chef lets the ingredients do the talking.  We also ordered a couple of cocktails which were very good as well. This was my first meal in Montreal and I'm looking forward to many more like it!"}
{"text":"Neat little resto tucked in the Petite-Patrie area near Beaubien station.  Walked into the door with the open kitchen at the front and a face full of delicious smells. There was a bit of a wait, it took no longer than 10 minutes and the host/server offered us a drink and even stools to sit on while we waited. I dig the interior design a lot, with it's lightbulb-lit lightning shaped sign, the lovely turquoise accent wall at the rear and the subtle homages to \"Santa Barbara\" (who I couldn't resist looking up and apparently is the patron saint of artillerymen, military engineers, miners and ppl who work with explosives). Also they give away buttons! I love buttons. Anyplace I get buttons is already a step ahead.  The menu is meatlover and vegetarian friendly and reasonably priced, they also have some delicious beer/wine choices on their list. We ordered an appetizer of cornbread, hummus, homemade salsa and walnuts to start. I had the special which was sweet potato au gratin with a side of kai-lan (chinese broccoli). It was incredible... and perfectly balanced the sweetness of the potato with the baked cheese topping. My friend had the gnocchi dish, made with the larger sized gnocchi \"dumpling\" bits and was also very good. Neither of us could finish our plates or had room for dessert. I did top it off with a tasty espresso though... mostly to avoid falling asleep on the way home due to my full belly.  Slight downside for me was that the seating is cozy. As in you may accidentally play footsie with your neighbour cozy. And if you get seated at a table bench-side mid row... good luck taking a pee break without ducking under the table or knocking a wineglass over with your badonkadonk while trying to delicately squeeze between tables (that may or may not have happened to me). This is probably not as much of an issue when they aren't quite as busy.  I would definitely come here more often if it wasn't on the complete opposite end of the city from where I live. That being said, it is worth the trek so I'll be returning for more mouthgasms eventually."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Cocktails are amazing!  Food is wonderfully eclectic and delicious.  The staff were attentive and cool!! Will be back whenever we are in Montreal!!"}
{"text":"Terrible!!! There's a reason it's the only brunch spot in the area with no lineup! The food was below average, too expensive for what it was! They refuse to give you side dishes even if it's on their menu and when i found an eggshell in my already disappointing dish they gave me a lousy 10% discount which was 1.60$...never again! I rather wait somewhere else and enjoy my Sunday morning brunch!"}
{"text":"Resto intéressant proche du métro Beaubien!  Repas un peu trop \"original\" à mon goût!  Le risoto chou fleur trop riche ma tombé sur le coeur... A essayer si on veut de l'originalité dans son assiette, pas toujours au top de l'attente qu'on pourrait s'en faire!"}
{"text":"I recently visited Santa Barbara to celebrate a friend's birthday and I was blown away by this gem tucked away in a side street in Rosemont.   The service was friendly but not over top, I felt welcome and comfortable. The space itself dark but homey, we felt ok hanging around after the meal to chat and finish our meals.   The food! Oh the food! Everything was beautiful and so tasty! The menu is mostly vegetarian but meat eaters won't miss it if they choose a veggie dish. I had the gnocchi with mushrooms. I had a certain idea of what I was going to get in mind, and it was not at all what I got.  Basic gnocchi with mushrooms is good .... this was amazing! Melt in your mouth gnocchi, a huge portion of mushrooms and gooey cheese, based in the most delicious sauce. My dining companions had the prodigies a.d the risotto, and both looked like equally good choices.   Overall a great experience, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A great brunch spot. Expect to pay on the pricier side, but you will get your money's worth in both quality and ambiance."}
{"text":"We've been here several times, for brunch and dinner and only had wonderful experiences.   The cocktails are interesting and always well executed. The food is incredible. The nice thing about this place is that the menu changes with the seasons. It's always a nice surprise to see what's being served. Even the items that are always there (ie. the mussels) change every time, and have always been amazing.  The service is wonderful. Friendly, knowledgable staff each time.  We were trying to think of a nice place to go for a birthday dinner... looked up all the restaurants in the neighbourhood to finally settle on this one, since we knew it'd be great, and we're not disappointed at all that we came back here.  The only thing to be aware of is that they don't take credit cards, which may come as a shock if you've spent quite a bit on dinner and weren't prepared."}
{"text":"I went there at least three times for brunch and I am never disappointed. Good service and food that I definitely don't make at home. So it feels like it's worth getting out of the house. Not just original; it's delicious. Good service too and cute decor. I'm excited to go again."}
{"text":"Fantastic service.  Plenty of vegetarian options, and items that could be made vegan, but one of the reviewers below wrongly describes this as a hipster vegan restaurant. He either doesn't know what a hipster is or a vegan (or both).  Either way, we ordered the perogies, corn fritters, kale salade and gin ans tonic.  Thé cocktail was blanc for the price, but all the food was fantastic. A little pricey for the portion sizes for some... But these are real restaurant portions, not sizzler portions."}
{"text":"Yay my 100th review-  When you have vegetarian friends- Santa Barbara should be top of your list.   This neighborhood friendly restaurant had a vintage feel to it. Quite small but intimate. I tip-toed in for dinner with a friend. Being a non-veg, the food was enriched with good flavors and warmth like a home cooked meal.   I tried out several dishes- starting with some fritters (served as two pieces) with a side of hummus (was ok), perogies drizzled in a cream sauce, crushed almonds and carrots (Rich but amazing combination of flavours), and the main- a baked acornsquash with a tomato sauce (melts in your mouth with each bite). For dessert- Creme Brulee! was too full to finish it (good for individuals or to share). I believe the menu changes regularly-don't take my word for it. It is also good for original cocktails.   Be warned-the decor including many statues of Mary all over the walls seemed a bit creepy- straight of a horror movie scene!"}
{"text":"Healthy and refreshing.  The beet appetizer was to die for!  Did not leave the restaurant feeling like I ate too much.   The portions were just right. The only negative comment was the noise level.  It felt like a noisy cafeteria.  We skipped dessert to get out of the din."}
{"text":"Friends recomendamos this place at brunch time, te service was fast and nice, the restaurant itself is cozy and colorful, food was tasty and original. Coming back to check out the other plates."}
{"text":"Les beignets aux poireaux et le fondant au chocolat, caramel et jalapeno sont des incontournables.  Excellent service"}
{"text":"A tasteful restaurant for the Montreal hipster vegan  with money to burn!  That said, all the items of the menu that we tried tonight were well worth the money, including the 12$ margarita à-la-Santa-Barbara. Non-vegan options include fish, lamb and mussels -- I tried the mussels and they tasted great. Kale is on the menu, in case you were wondering.   The place is an upscale offshoot of the celebrated breakfast place Le Vieux Vélo, located in the same area. Santa Barbara also does brunches, but we tried it only for a 7pm Friday dinner. By 7:30pm it was already packed and they don't take reservations. Arrive early!"}
{"text":"Beau petit resto de quartier à essayer. Menu original avec des belles saveurs qui se démarquent. Bonne bouffe bon service!"}
{"text":"Aujourd'hui, pour la St Valentin, nous nous sommes fait un brunch d'amoureuses entre copines!! Nous étions 4 et avons ainsi pu tester différents plats. Je dois dire que tous étaient excellents!! Seul petit hic, j'ai trouvé que c'était moins copieux que dans certaines places, pour les gros mangeurs.. pas de patates en quantité, ni de fruits frais \"on the side\" par exemple... A part ça, super endroit, déco sobre mais sympa, service excellent, et choix de brunchs alléchants! A essayer!"}
{"text":"I loved last night at Santa Barbara. We came for a friend's birthday an got to seat in the back room which had all kinds of interesting design features like a sprinkler collection on the wall, and a window to the street. Once everyone arrive (we were 12) they got our drinks order. They had an original cocktail menu as well as wine and beer. I tried a non alcoholic beverage Chicha Morada, which was very interesting. Between us we ordered most of the menu and every dish was a success. The leek fritter on labane and zaatar was simple but well executed. The corn chowder was a hit. The mushroom crostini was also raved. For the main dish I got the butternut squash gratin which was orange and soft and was served with hard caramelized almonds as well as green sauce that made for nice contrasts both in color and texture. The Soba salad was one of the most successful dishes even though it was very simple. Desserts were nice and original and my favorite was the cream brule with black sesame with a close second - cardamom chocolate cake. Service throughout the evening was pleasant and professional. The waiters showed great knowledge about the various dishes that helped to facilitate decisions all around . One thing - I would change the classification to $$$."}
{"text":"Their food name is very interesting, the place is adorable. We had one dish \"pompier\" and one\"electrician\". The electrician is too sour for me. In all, their food are not bad, but not as good as I expected."}
{"text":"Brunch amazingness is served at Santa Barbara! Easily  my number one in this part of town. The portions are a bit generous. The food is fresh and delicious. The menu is about 7 items long with plenty of veg options and all pretty light even the beer and apple crepe. I had the gravlax with avocado dill cream, scrambled eggs and greens. So light and lovely! The drinks menu is part alcoholic part fresh juices. The staff is a DREAM. So friendly and attentive! The interior is super cool and fun as well. Santa Barbara might be off the beaten path but it's good to wander ;)"}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian-friendly fare. Meat makes an appearance on the menu but treated \"as a celebration rather than an obligation\". I recommend the market fresh fish, perogies with beet salad, quinoa salad with peas and pistachio, and the white-wine mussels.   Sprightly cocktails and out-of-this-world house juices created by the sweet and talented cook, Melissa.   The ambiance is cozy, comfortable and light which is refreshing in a city dominated by dark woods and rustic, bohemian vibes. They play good music and not too loudly so perfect place to enjoy with a small group.   A much-needed and welcomed addition to this hip neighborhood."}
{"text":"Here are the things I loved last night at Santa Barbara:  The Rhuby, white wine with rhubarb: not too sweet, the perfect summer drink, totally unlike anything else I've tried, totally delicious.   The pineapple chilli homemade soda - fresh, the chilli is not too hot but cuts the sweet, super fun non-boozey drink.   The appetizers and salads. All of them. The feta, green pea and dill mezze was so light and scrumptious salty and I could have eaten this all to myself. The zucchini fritters were light so savoury and not at all greasy tasting, the herb butter they were served with had me schemeing ways to lick the plate.   The kale salad I could have (and should have) eaten for dinner instead of sharing with a table full of vultures (jokes!) The panzanella my sister ordered was filling and light at the same time and would be top of my list for next time.   The place is bright with restful colours and a lively clattery atmosphere, seats about 40 I'd guess so not too crowded. The staff seemed a little stretched thin at moments but were faultlessly gracious throughout a barrage of mom questions from my table.   And the thing I didn't love sadly? My own main..  I ordered the special and so did another of my crew, and we were both kind of left flat by it. The mussels and shrimp curry with rice and asparagus sounded delicious and was just kind of.. meh, ok. Nothing particularly wrong with it, just heavy basic flavours, asparagus on the side feeling like an afterthought, boney fish in the curry, two shrimp total, I dunno.. not bad, just wished I'd stuck with the amazing salads and good looking green things swirling all around me instead.   Anyway, live and learn. I'll be back for cocktails, apps and salads 100%.   Oh - heads up, they don't take credit cards here, just debit."}
{"text":"après en avoir entendu parler, parler et re-parler, je suis finalement allé faire mon tour en compagnie de ma meilleure copine.   puisque nous sommes arrivées vers 10ham, il n'y avait pas d'attente pour le brunch. Toutefois verd 12h, 2-3 couples attendaient une table.   Je me suis laissé tenter par l'assiette du marin : gravlax de saumon, oeuf poché, pain et salade. Si le gravlax était délicieux, le pain était correct et ne venait avec aucune confiture. c'était bon, mais l'assiette était minuscule. Je suis sortie l'envie de manger encore un peu. j'aurais pris des fruits, pourquoi pas. L'espresso est TRÈS fruité, évitez si vous être accros au café corsé.   Le service était bien, on sent que c'est un personnel qui travaille là depuis plusieurs années. Il y règne un ambiance de 'quartier', très familiale et friendly.   bref un bel essai, et j'y retournerais si j'habitais dans le quartier. Mais ce n'est pas le cas, et il y a d'autres restaurants à essayer !"}
{"text":"Sympathique resto bien situé, au cur d'un quartier en pleine ébullition.   J'ai essayé l'assiette déjeuner \"L'architecte\" qui était très bien. Ce n'est pas un endroit pour un déjeuner classique de type \"2 oeufs avec bacon\".  Des assiettes originales sont proposées. Clientèle du secteur. Bonne ambiance.  Seul petit hic, je suis arrivée à 9:55 (sois une forte plui) et on m'a rappelée un peu froidement que ce n'était pas encore ouvert...Service à la clientèle maladroit de la part de cette dame. Par contre, les serveur(euses) étaient très bien."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my absolute favourite part of the day so I'm utterly sorry to say the food here was completely underwhelming in every way... our server was sweet but lacked experience and attentiveness. My dish had burnt toast on the outside that I couldn't even chew it was so hard, and the middle was completely soggy from the salad which was overly sour. I asked for my eggs to be medium over easy and the waiter kinda brushed me off. I was worried he didn't take note of my request and I was right, my eggs were completely runny. My potatoes had little to no taste and were hard and cold down the middle:/ Moreover, my dad's girlfriend asked for no bacon in her dish too and little to our surprise there was meat in it, she had to send it back and henceforth delayed her breakfast. Nonetheless, I did love the warm and beautiful setting inside, reminded me of the carribean. So overall, could've had a better breakfast experience but I'm rooting for this spot to get it right."}
{"text":"This is such a cute, little place. The Santa Barbara offers great, fresh, comfort food, just perfect for the soul. I also promised myself to go back for brunch sometime soon. In the meantime, if you do happen to pass by for dinner, make sure to try the delicious enchiladas !!"}
{"text":"This was our first stop after crossing the border. We had been driving 8 hours, and had in no way anticipated that our GPS would switch to roaming as soon as we entered Canada. Also, I had thought there would be a more even split between French and English, so we were kind of in a culture shock. I'm not very good at vacationing, I guess. So, it was nice to have a pleasant dining experience after all that!   Santa Barbara is a nice casual-but-trendy place. Lots of light woods, religious iconography, candlelight. The waitress was very nice. I tried speaking French, she spoke French back, I stared at her wide-eyed as I realized I was in way over my head, and she promptly and pleasantly switched to English. I could have hugged her.   Menu is very simple, and bilingual. Of import: although this place is primarily vegetarian, there are a few animal dishes on the menu. Pork chops and a couple fish dishes. This is relevant. Read on.   I permitted myself an alcoholic drink, bcs I deserved it. Gin with citrus and earl grey tea. It tasted delicious, but was small for the price (in my opinion; I don't drink much, so I'm not a good judge!) and I couldn't really taste the tea.   Joe got the gnocchi, which he raved about. I tried some and it was absolutely delicious. My entree came with quinoa, which was mixed with beets and oranges. I had never had quinoa like this, and I have to say it was delicious. I am definitely stealing the idea to make at home! The rest of my entree was fish. Because I am an absolute moron and accidentally ordered fish. I cannot tell you how the server would have reacted if I sent it back, bcs I was too humiliated to do so. So I chopped it into little pieces, casually hid it in my napkin, and then threw it out later. I think one of the other waiters saw me, because he came by and was like, \"Ca va?\" Then he said some other stuff, which may have been, \"Because I see that you are wrapping your food in your napkin like a maniac.\" but I didn't understand it, so I just said, \"Oui!!!!!! Ca va bien!!!!! Merci merci merci!\" over and over until he must have concluded that I was definitely a maniac and left.   This is how the socially awkward deal with problems, people!   Despite my idiocy, I will repeat: the gnocci and quinoa were both fantastic. And honestly, even when I ate meat, I didn't like fish, but this fish smelled and looked incredible. If I were still a meat eater, I would have tried it. Promise.   They take cards, but ours didn't work, so we had to get cash across the street at a gas station. By then, I think the waitress was sick of us, bcs she seemed to get a little snippy. But I promise, we were doing our absolute best as strangers in a strange land! (Yes, I am using that phrase even though I'm talking about a girl from Rochester going to Canada.)"}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant in my visit to Montreal. Both, dinner and brunch were quite good. Drinks were creative and service was friendly but professional. Vegetarian options were very tasty."}
{"text":"D'inspirations Californienne, ce restaurant est une petite merveille. Ambiance chill et healthy, l'intérieur est vraiment cosy avec ses murs turquoise et ses petites tables en bois. En été, quelques tables sont disposées sur le trottoir mais la rue est calme, on en profite. Le menu change souvent, et je suis à chaque fois surprise, et jamais déçue. Que ce soit pour des brunchs ou un souper, tout est délicieux. J'ai déjà eu le plaisir de goûter à des gnocchis de courges musquées, béchamel et lardons et oeufs pochés (un régal !!!) ou encore un strudel (pain farci aux asperges, champignons, crème fraiche et ciboulette)... foumalade ! Des cocktails à tomber et du bon vin pour arroser le tout, sans parler de la gentillesse du personnel. J'aimerais même garder cette adresse pour moi :)"}
{"text":"Un excellent brunch près de Beaubien ! Le lieu est vraiment chouette, deco originale. On a pu profiter de la terrasse qui est très agréable également. La carte est assez simple, on est meme presque un peu décue, on s'attend à plus fancy. Mais c'est dans l'assiette que ca se passe ! Ca goute divin !  J'ai pris le Spécial, pain de mais, salade de patates douces et feves rouges avec 2 oeufs  miroirs. On a testé aussi le soldat d'artillerie, une crepe pommes/cheddar fort et bacon. Et une boisson maison, concombre menthe et lime. Tout est une tuerie ! Allez y en fermant les yeux :)"}
{"text":"I'm one of the rare breed that doesn't get all excited for Taco Tuesdays (I mean, are tacos not like the easiest thing to assemble at home?), if Santa Barbara were to somehow magically exist in my city, I might change my stance.  I saw the tacos listed on the sandwich board as I made my way in, but didn't think much about them, instead getting all excited for the array of gorgeous salads listed on the menu. Then one of my dining partners filled me in on the vegetarian taco and our friendly server confirmed that it was indeed, vegan, so I was sold. Fresh peas. Guacamole. Asparagus. Tomatoes. Resistance would be futile, I realized.  But first, our salads. We shared three: the kale, the fatoush (lebnah on the side) and the endive (it has a different name, but I cannot recall it). Of the three, I found myself wanting to keep the fatoush all to myself but I'm nice and I share! The za'atar coating the leaves is plentiful and adds the best taste ever to the entire thing and the falafel is just perfection. There's also crunchy bits of pita and the entire creation is pure deliciousness. I liked the kale, but I'm not a fan of all those pickled onions. The endive isn't terribly exciting, but really fresh and a great accompaniment if paired with a heartier dish.  The tacos. Oh, the tacos. Just as good as expected, three corn tortillas bursting with the aforementioned ingredients. I'm really a fan of the flavors & textures going on here, the creaminess of the guacamole, the crunchy freshness of the sweet peas and tangy asparagus and the juiciness of the acidic tomatoes... pure excellence!   Aaaaand they have a Gamay, people! My absolute favorite French wine.   I don't love the no credit card thing, but that's the only negative thing here and its minor when you consider all the greatness waiting for you. Still, if all things are equal, I'd have to give Santa Barbara a pass because I rarely have cash... (see what I did there?)"}
{"text":"Vraiment bon! Bel endroit et bon service. Belle carte d'alcool mais peu de bières. Vous y trouverez une petit terrasse sympa. Belle déco. On se croirait a Brooklyn :P"}
{"text":"First things first, this place is cash and Interac ONLY  Now onto more important things: the cocktails are amazing and they are always switching them up. For a veggisaurus like me, there are a TON of choices and I have never left here less than absolutely, freaking stuffed and happy. They switch up their mussel recipe fairly often which is good, but their curry mussels are to die for, everyone at the table was pretty much stabbing one another to soak up what was left. Everything on the menu is tasty, fresh and delicious and the staff completely rule. Cozy spot and you can always get a table if you're patient, well worth the wait if they make you wait."}
{"text":"Oh man I was longing to try that restaurant for so long now. Maybe I had too much expectations. Not that it wasn't good...I just thought it'd be great. First the place is adorable; I loved the decor. The menu is short but interesting. They have a very few choices for wine by the glass, but I managed to drink a great red. For starter my friend and I shared the Russian kale salad, we opted for the big plate because the waitress said the small was very tiny. Boy that was a lot of kale. The plate was huge and good. As a main course I had the gnocchi. The waitress really sold me the gnocchi saying how complex and unique the dish was. Well maybe the bar was set too high. The gnocchi by themselves were delicious; moist enough, cooked perfectly and flavourful. But I didn't see any complexity to that dish. Yes it was topped with pine nuts, old cheddar cheese and had some cabbage purée on the side...is that complex? Plus the cabbage purée was SOOOOO salty. I'm a salty gal but that was way too salty. My friend took the fish of the day which was the grilled char. The filet was huge but the plate really lack of sides... At 29$ the plate she wished she had more veggies. The service was friendly and professional but very slow. So overall, I'm not saying I wouldn't go back but I'm not gonna run to go back neither...."}
{"text":"Super ambiance, drinks délicieux, plats d'une fraicheur exceptionnelle. Mention spéciale à la salade de kale et aux moules!! Un petit trésor de resto dans la Petite Patrie."}
