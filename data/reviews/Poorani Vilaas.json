{"text":"Poorani Vilaas is located at the new shopping complexe at the corner of Markham Road and Steeles Avenue E.

As I walked in I was hit with a waft of aromatic spices.  The Singapour Noodles looked interesting but I decided to skip it given this was an Indian joint.

With uncertainty written all over my face, the girl behind the counter kindly recommended the Chicken Biryani.  I agreed, not wanting to irritate further the eight or so Desi gents waiting patiently behind me.

While I'm sure it's considered standard heat for most, for me it felt like it was cooked with lava and a healthy dose of blue flame.  I didn't know pepperspray was part of the ingredients.

Ultimately, I did manage to get through the meal and the day albeit in somewhat of a stupor.

A warning for those not used to spicy food -- have a glass of milk on standby.

While the cost was an unbelivably cheap tax-included price of $4.50, the meal, which consisted of 1 piece of  chiecken and a boiled egg was mainly rice.

So, if you're looking for an super inexpensive carb reload, Poorani Vilaas is perfect for you. Otherwise, it's a pass."}
{"text":"I specifically asked for CHICKEN fried rice. Not shrimp fried rice or mixed fired rice or seafood fried rice. 

Since when does chicken fried rice have seafood with shrimp and squid in it?? Some people are allergic to seafood. Get your shit together before your business sends someone to the hospital. 

This is just another jumble of everything mixed into rice. Some lazy service right here. Throw whatever is available at hand's reach, throw it in and call it fried rice. 

Absolutely the worst fried rice I ever seen. Yeah I am not even going to bother trying to eat this garbage."}
{"text":"Poorani vilaas offers good quality food.  It is reasonably priced (expensive compared to other similar stores, but relatively cheaper considering all other food options).  There are some things that are simply amazing.  For example, a vegetarian meal (rice with various curries) is just amazing.  It is great to order for an event, especially when you need to order vegetarian food.  There are also some other special things like \"Poorani special fried rice\" or the \"Poorani special fried noodles\" is really good.  They make their string hoppers (a common sri lankan food) in-house (which is pretty much unheard of).  Their mutton patties are SO SPICY and SO GOOD!  They are 75 cents each, but totally totally worth it...if you can handle it that is!"}
{"text":"I've had takeout from here a couple times. They have a selection of Tamil food - the snacks (vadai, crisps, etc) are good. They are famous for the appam (hoppers) but I find this to be extremely inconsistent. Sometimes they are delicious and well-prepared, sometimes it is a watery, soupy mess. Most recently, it was the latter. Have also had the thosai here and it is super greasy.

My 2-star rating is because the food here is not consistently good.

Things I have not tried - the chicken biryani, rice dishes etc. I might be back again. Not sure yet though."}
{"text":"I drove by Poorani Vilaas an Indian takeout joint almost everyday after work, sometimes even after 9 PM. This place is still open and looks busy. 

I finally went in and check it out this afternoon, since I have no time for a sit down lunch and takeout seems like a much better idea.

When I entered the store, I was greeted warmly.. but I really have no idea what should I get and what tastes good! I think eat in an Indian restaurant once in my whole life time.

Thanks for the lady at the counter being so helpful. Answering all my questions! Since none of the items are labelled.
 
\"What is that?\" \"What is this?\"
\"It is spicy?\" \"It is sweet?\"
\"What's inside?\"
\"How does it taste like?\"

Even when she told me what that is, I am still not sure.... 
She was really nice offer to let me tast the yellow looking rice (which is really spicy fried rice with chicken) and a pastry like mini donut thing that is salty...(I still not sure what that is) If I can taste everything  :)!

Anyway, I decide with Biryani (chicken fried rice), 1 chicken curries and 2 Vaaipan (brown baseball looking thing, she told me is sweet with banana inside). The meal also comes with a tomato salad full of chilli pepper, yeah!!!

I have to tell you the food is really good. Spicy enough that I don't need to add anymore hot sauce. But the smell is really strange, the whole office ask me what I am having for lunch!

All the prices includes taxes. 

I would definitely go back and try out other items they offer.  

Excellent services, clean environment and friendly staffs!"}
