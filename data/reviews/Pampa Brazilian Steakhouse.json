{"text":"Probably gives Brazilian steak a bad name and should apologies. Went there for the 2for1 Rodizio sounds like a decent thing to do. Took about 40 Min to be seated with reservations, once seated we were asked still or sparkling - thinking there would be a charge for sparkles we ordered Still wooops 2 bucks a head for water, what is this Brazil! 

The meat when sliced looked nice and juicy, only to be disappointed with tough finger spraining work especially since they don't use quality steak knives :( 

The taste is like eating a burnt salt cube Yummm.. However, i still managed to eat probably 2  Lbs and drink about 10 L of water so maybe 2$ for water isnt to bad :O

The salad bar is decent nothing to crazy 

The Good: My wife loved the cheese bread i think she ate more of that then meat lolz 

Service once seated and forgetful about mentioning a water charge, which we forgave due to the great service we did receive. 

All you can eat Meat Salt

The best work out you can get - like sawing a rock with a spoon 

Conclusion:

If your in for a expensive fix of meat hit one of the many awesome steak houses our fine city has - heck there is at least three two in a 4 block radius and skip this disappointment."}
{"text":"1st time at pampas--can't say enough about it, excellent food, service and decor with a well thought wine menu. We'll be back, it was a great experience and a great dining destination restaurant in Calgary. I hope Pampas will be a main stay in Calgary!"}
{"text":"I took my out-of-town sister for dinner to Pampa on the weekend. The salad bar was good but the meat came too fast too often even with our red \"stop\" card out. A few cuts were good, others not well seasoned and a bit tough as I've tasted at other Brazilian BBQs. 

But what really did NOT impress us was $2 each for a glass of tap water! I know this is Calgary, the land of oil & gas stupidity, but we're not morons. If I'm paying for water I want to know I'm paying for it and I want it in a bottle!"}
{"text":"Grab your choice of fresh vegetables from the salad bar and set your discs to the green side which reads \"SIM, POR FAVOR!!\" (Translated to YES, PLEASE!) and get ready to have a wide variety of meat selection coming your way!

If you haven't been to Pampa then you ARE missing out! Yes it can be pricey but hey it's actually worth your money. Although parking is stressful to find since it is in downtown it is actually worth the experience.

A quick rundown of how Pampa (and other Brazilian restaurants) work is that first you go to the salad bar just to get your choice of salad then when you're ready you'll turn your disc from red to green indicating to the Gauchos that you are ready to be bombarded with meat. At any time you can flip the disc from green to red if you have enough. A smart way my girlfriend and I thought was to have one of us in the table while the other visit the salad bar and take turns, the Gauchos won't forget about you and will add meat onto your plate.

The meat selection is on par, the Pampa pork sausages and chicken drumstick are cooked to perfection while the other choices of meat is cooked from a range of medium to well done, I believe they also offer medium rare but I'm not 100% sure.

Since my girlfriend and I attended Pampa's lunch section we were limited to what meat they had versus their dinner selection but nevertheless it is will worth the experience. You'll get rump steak, top sirloin, bottom sirloin, Pampa pork sausage, Parmesan pork lion, and marinated French chicken legs. My favourite would be the rump steak and bottom sirloin. After getting to try one of every meat selection twice the Gauchos would ask you (or you can request yourself) if there's a specific meat that you want more of.

The servers provide you with a clean plate every time but if you keep making stops to the salad bar you're actually getting a new plate for yourselves and saving them the trouble.

Overall it is a great experience and would definitely come back in the near future, maybe for dinner this time but who knows!"}
{"text":"The restaurant has a really nice open concept and I like watching them grill the meat. The salad bar was really big with lots of options, especially pickled food. I enjoyed the pickled watermelon rind and I want to try to make some next summer. There were lots of sauces to choose from at the salad bar but I didn't manage to get any until almost half way through my meal because the meat kept coming and coming and I couldn't resist. The meat was hit and miss, some pieces of the signature rump roast were really delicious and perfectly cooked while other pieces and other cuts of meat were over cooked, tough and really salty. One of the chefs that served the meat was amazing he would stop by every table every single trip. However, after it got busier and more meat servers started serving meat the service wasn't as good. Even though our sign was green they never stopped by and we couldn't get a hold of our waitress because she was busy serving lot of other tables. That being said it's a really good deal to go before the end of October because they have a 2 for the price of 1 dinner special. When it's original price I would rather go to Bolero because they have more cuts of meat and they have grilled pineapple."}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get (came Sunday Night). Most meat was over cooked and the salad bar was ok at best. Will not be back."}
{"text":"A friend recommended Pampas. I wasn't sure it was my kind of thing but decided to go with the flow. OMG WOW! I was so impressed. First, the food was absolutely delicious. The salad bar was unbelievable, as were the main course accompaniments. Don't get me started on the meats; the flavours were outstanding. Our server was wonderful; friendly, knowledgeable and attentive but not overly so. The gauchos were great and their timing was perfect. We went on a Monday night and by the time we left the restaurant, which is very large, was almost completely full. I understand why. I would go back and would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Took advantage of pampa's current 2 for 1 deal.  I really enjoyed the decor and service.  Staff were wonderful.  A lot of the meats served were overcooked.  The buffet was decent with fresh choices.  I would like to give it a better rating but the rodizio let this place down."}
{"text":"Unfortunately today you will not get a good review from me: a friend of mine placed a reservation for 7 price for labour day, which was accepted, only to find out that you decided to close that day..."}
{"text":"I had such an amazing experience at Pampa, I booked my company's year end party there.  Had a Groupon deal & headed down with 3 peeps to complete my entourage.  The staff were attentive & knowledgeable, answering questions & when 1 didn't know the answer would get someone who did.  The salad bar was unreal giving such a wide variety of selections.  I almost filled up on that.  I said almost.  The carnivore, inner beast (you get the point) was set loose I had chicken heart for the 1st time.  I wanted more.  Everything tastes so damn good it's easy to want more.  PACE YOURSELVES.  Divide & conquer.  For dessert, we each ordered a different item so we could have bites of each other's.  The only complaint I have is there's no wheelchair service for when you're done.  I've been in contact with Scott the manager in preparation for my party.  Have a feeling it's going to be epic."}
{"text":"Went in for an early dinner on a Wednesday with a friend.  Atmosphere was a little stark but the staff made up for it.  Our waiter was helpful and attentive, the gauchos serving the meat were friendly and always circulating.  The salad bar was adequate, but wouldn't expect more from a meat oriented restaurant.  Pleasantly surprised by the choice of hot dishes and sauces at the salad bar.  If you had a favorite meat the gauchos would happily come round with more of it.  All in all a very good experience.  A little more atmosphere and it would be a solid 5 star.  Worth the price."}
{"text":"Their bacon wrapped chicken are delicious. Buffet bar were not as good as Mina's from my personal opinion. Seafood night actually was just extra shrimp skewer than usual, I would not call it a seafood night. Meat chef was friendly and cute though."}
{"text":"Good stuff but can get really expensive. They keep bringing you the meat rapid fire. Room looks pretty nice though"}
{"text":"I went to Pampa in Edmonton last year and loved it! I am so happy they are in Calgary now too! I had my birthday dinner here and it was just as amazing as my first time! I love the salad bar, great selections, LOVE the roasted garlic and the olive oils & vinegars. The garlic steak is one of my favourites. I also tried the Brazilian Lemonade which was good too but next time I will probably try the Caipirinhas. I desperately wanted to leave room for dessert but I couldn't turn down more steak! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I visited Pampa for the first time during lunch for The Big Taste. For $15 you got the salad bar, choice of one meat and dessert. I love, love, loved their salad bar. It is a salad bar on steroids complete with calamari salad, ceviche and more. So good. I picked the Parmesan crusted pork loin for my meat and it was amazing. Flavourful and tender. Fruit mouse finished off the meal. I can't decide if it was mango, passion fruit or a mix of the two. Oh and last but not least....the cheese rolls on the table are epic. I could eat one meeeeeelion of them. 

I can't wait to visit again. Definitely come hungry, though, because it's after dinner time and I'm still stuffed."}
{"text":"I went for their full rodizio and it was great. Wide selections of fine meat and good spread of food in their salad bar. It was the \"Seafoood Day\" when I was there and their one and only seafood is salmon, which is not the best - tasted dry and muddy. Was tempted to try their dessert. It would be great if they have included that in their full rodizo. Honestly, I wouldn't mind paying a little bit more for that."}
{"text":"Way to Pricey

Went for our Wedding Anniversary on July 1/15 and was completely disappointed, expected to pay more than normal and that was not a problem. BUT expected a better experience for the price ($200 plus for 2 people). ALL the meats tasted the same and TOO MUCH SALT, nothing had a distinctive taste, meat was fatty and grissly. Salad Bar was \"eye candy\" only and really nothing had any flavour, was hard to make a salad with what they offered, deserts were also \"eye candy\" and way over priced. Service was good but slow, only one waitress, gaucho's were fast and efficient. Can't recommend to anyone, what a waste of a Special Day and BIG DOLLARS. There are much better Brazilian Steakhouses in the city.

Definitely will not return."}
{"text":"7 courses of steak. Fillet mignon, chop sirloin, signature steak, lamb, New York strip, bacon wrapped chicken and salad bar is free all you can eat stlye with mushroom cream soup, tomatos, smashed potatoes, veges, rices and so on, Groupon was 25 per person with complimentary house wine, choice of white and red and beer. The Brazil lemonade is better than the Brazilian Soda, you gotta try! Awesome experience ."}
{"text":"Best Brazilian Steakhouse in Calgary. Period!
Went here on Friday evening for a  B-day dinner with a couple friends. Instantly was impressed with the salad bar; so many better and fresher options compared to Boleros! Then the meats started coming out...damn...their top sirloin was hands down the best meat on the list! Cooked perfectly and made available for most of the night. I really enjoyed all the meats, although I didn't try the lamb but my wife to be said it was delish! The pork belly was ok but its a 'take it or leave it' kinda ok. The service was well beyond 5 stars! Our server was amazing and friendly; We were done eating at 8:30, paid at 8:45 but didn't leave until 10:00 pm but our server never made us felt like we needed to leave. Kept our water always topped up and was never hovered our table. 

I've eaten at every Brazilian Steakhouse in Calgary and this is #1 easily. And it's cheaper than Boleros. A must try for all you carnivores ;)"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked  we were Greeted by two welcoming benevolent hostess.
From the moment we were seated the bus staff and the waiter were very cordial.
The Guacho ( The men with the meat skewers)
Came to serve very attentive to our taste .(rare or well done )
Been to many Restaurants such as this ; but the service here was far beyond expectations

A fellow came over to our table in an amicable  matter and asked ...
\"If all was to our satisfaction? \"

At that moment he Introduced himself as the manager (Tim Meikle ) I realized why the restaurant was run so proficient and the staff was attentive, respectful and obliging
The atmosphere and the restaurant was clean so we have to rake this is a five star for all the above"}
{"text":"As the place we wanted to go on Mothers Day ended up having a 3.5hr waiting list we ended up at Pampa as they were taking reservations and had space for a table of 5.

Going to admit, based on what I had heard about Pampa (very ambivalent reviews), I wasn't too excited but ended up being pleasantly surprised. For Mothers Day they had their small menu option on offer for $29.50 which I thought was pretty reasonable.

Meat option on offer:
1. pork sausages - pretty tasty, little chewy
2. leg of lamb - well seasoned and done to just medium, very good
3. Chicken drumsticks - what do you do to these? Man they are delicious!
4. Rump steak - liked that they kept coming around with different types of \"done-ness (is that a word?), both medium, well and rare were being eaten at the table and they made sure to come by with all options for us. This was melt in your mouth delicious.
5. Pork loin - parmesan crusted pork loin? Ok we will have all of that
6. Barbecued pork belly - lovely crisp skin and well done to the point that it wasn't all fatty but just tasty
7. or yeah there was a 7th, roasted ham that came with a great gravy. Yum!

I am not the biggest meat eater but you can bet I did my best to consume it all. The salad selection was nice and varied. Liked that they had some veg options in there too.

We also tried the grilled pineapple. It is a taste sensation. But buyer beware - it is $7 each for all you can eat. This is a little much. How much pineapple can one person eat? Come on guys you can take that down some I think. Anyone else feeling me on this? One star less for greed.

I must mention the service, waiter was attentive enough and paid attention to tables getting his attention. If we requested a specific meat he was on it and followed up to make sure we had received what we had requested. There were also only 2 of 5 us at the table that were eating pork. Good work on the part of the various gauchos for remebering who was eating pork and only re-offering to us.

Beside the ridiculous cost of pineapple (although delicious) I was really surprised how tasty all the meat was and the nice variety of salads. Hear dinner has more options but really nit sure how I could have eaten more anyway. Lunch is a better deal than dinner and will definitely be back for more of that, maybe minus pineapple.

Thanks for the pleasant surprise Pampa!"}
{"text":"Pampas Brazilian Steak House: 9/10/2016
Service: - very good. 
Restaurant: Nice, modern and functional, large windows, and well organized
Salad Bar: Freshness excellent, flavors OK, sliced zucchini has no flavor but looks nice, the tabouli salad did not have sufficient parsley and the bulgar wheat was not soft enough given it a coarse texture. The potato salad, cooked beets and fresh lettuce were very good.  
Meat: The center piece of the restaurant is their generous meat served off a metal skewer.  The meat is cook on the skewer which also becomes hot as the outside is being grilled.  The result is that small pieces such as bacon wrapped chicked and parmesan pork are over cook and the meat is dry.  The top sirloins are done in large pieces which does not produce the same result and are really moist and tasty. The filet was very small & wrapped in bacon. The flavor of the bacon overpowered the flavor of the small portion meats.  You can order as much as you can eat. 
Dessert:  Excellent but small and pricey - $9-$12 each. 
Tips: We had a 40% off groupon deal and rightfully the server pointed out that tips are not included and should be calculated on the total price of the meal.  She gave some sample tip suggestions and went on to explain how the waitresses do not see much of the tips as the servers take 11% off the top.  Diners do not want to hear these tales as it sounds like the staff if grousing for a bigger tip.
Wine and Beer - House wine and beer was included and was good. 
Overall: For fine dining, a good experience.  The servers interrupt the table often as they offer more for your plate but that is expected. Price value was good with the Groupon deal. Probably come back - perhaps with the 2 for 1 lunch coupons."}
{"text":"This place is great I love the meats nice and fresh and juicy right off the grille I also love the grilled pineapple taste amazing. I would have to say this is one the better brazilian steakhouses. I tried the Mina's one and I was disappointed I would have to say Bolero & Pampa are the best one's in calgary."}
{"text":"Let me throw it back to 1999, when Chastity thoughtfully pondered in 10 Things I Hate About You... \"I know you can be overwhelmed, and you can be underwhelmed, but can you ever just be... whelmed?\" 

Well yes, Chastity, you can. And we don't even have to go to Europe. 

Pampa was whelming. Everything seemed hit or miss. The parmesan crusted pork loin was dry. Which was a shame as the flavour was good, though erring on the side of too salty. The bacon-wrapped chicken was dry and flavourless. In fact nothing bacon-wrapped was particularly good (including the filet mignon) and that's a real insult to bacon. And filet mignon. The picanha would come out perfectly medium-rare at one point and then completely overcooked and grey the next time. The sausage was texturally gummy and flavourless. I want my sausages bursting in flavour and feeling good in my mouth!* The lamb was overcooked, dry and... flavourless. Do we detect a pattern here? I know Mary would be disappointed at the outcome of her little lamb.

The gauchos visited the tables at well-timed intervals but you saw more the chicken and sausage way more frequently in the rotation than the other (more expensive) meats. I burn, I pine, I perish for sirloin but all I get is bad sausage. *That's what she said. Over and over again.

Gauchos were friendly enough and served the meats with expertise but sorry, señor, there's only so much undercooked bacon wrapped around overcooked chicken that I can stomach. 

The rest of the service was adequate. Water replenished when asked. Plates cleared when they amassed on the table. Nothing more, nothing less. Drinks and desserts (anything to up-sell) are pushed very aggressively. The salad bar has the typical buffet fare. Nothing particularly delicious, nothing particularly horrible. The offerings were not replenished so large platters would just sit empty. The accompanying cheese bread was delicious but if the highlight of a meal at a steakhouse is the carbs... oh boy. I think they might be focusing on the wrong food group.

If Brazilian meat sweats is your thing then stick with Gaucho or Bolero.

(2.5 stars but my outfit this evening was both pensive and thoughtful so I'm feeling benevolent.)"}
{"text":"I have been to a fair share of Brazilian steakhouses and by far this is the worst salad bar I've ever been to. Everything was flavorless and under seasoned. Their corn tasted like it was days old and was mushy. 40 something cuts of meat but for the duration we were there we were only served 5."}
{"text":"Last night was my second time at this restaurant, and I have been very impressed with the service and the food. This time when I came in, I called ahead and inquired about allergy information (currently following the Whole30 meal plan, and I wanted to know how the meats were prepared for compliant reasons). The host brought my questions to the chef, and I was very pleased that most of the meats brought to the table were safe for me to eat. Even the salad bar listed the ingredients used on each item so that I knew which foods I could indulge in and which to avoid. A nice place to visit with friends and very accommodating for those who may have allergies to soy, gluten, dairy or MSG (or for those who want to avoid those ingredients). I would definitely return for a third time!"}
{"text":"A few of us came to take advantage of their 2 for 1 dinner rodizio (until the end of October).  I've only been to Gaucho and Minas and all of these places offer a similar selection of meat.  Despite of the other reviews on the doneness of the meat, all of the items we sampled that night was cooked according to our liking and I was happy and surprised to see chicken hearts (not on the web menu)! The side/salad bar was decent but I was disappointed that they took away the cheese wheel.  I also noticed the price has gone down from $54.95/59.95 to the current price of $44.95 which is a lot more reasonable imo.  However, they need to really rethink their pricing for children - my friend and I didn't bring our sons because there's noway our 3 and 4 year olds can eat $19.95 worth of meat ($19.95 for 3-5; $29.95 for 6-11).  Minas only start charging $1.25 per year for 4 and over! Service was pretty good - we were checked on a couple of times by a manager to ensure everything was going well.  Overall I'm glad we took advantage of their special offer and gave them a try."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, wonderful selection, ambiance, and food. Amazing first experience!"}
{"text":"When you like a Rodizio type of service, this is the best place to enjoy. We came here for Sunday brunch. Our server was excellent! however gauchos ( they're the ones carrying the skewers to go around each table and serve meat)were only 3 and would be more effecient if they add another gauchos to serve meat. Gauchos kind of slow. Would still come back though"}
{"text":"Went for dinner here a couple weeks ago with a gentleman. We both came hungry and visions of meat spits in our head, and we weren't disappointed! We made reservations ahead of time so were seated quickly. For a Saturday night at 6:30 the restaurant was buzzing, but not overly busy. We were given the low down by our waitress/hostess. There is a salad bar that you have access to all night and can go savage on it. The meat spits are brought around by waiters throughout your stay when you flip your chip up to the green side. Flip it over to red to stop them from coming to your table. We ordered two glasses of wine from the extensive menu, then grabbed a hearty plate of salad. Throughout the evening we rotated through a variety of chicken, pork, lamb and steak meat options. I tried all but the pork. My favourite was the rare steak, so juicy and tender! I might have to start going rare instead of my go to medium rare! Part way through the night we watched as our hostess/waitress did a display of pouring a golden syrup alcohol from atop a chair into a shot glass for the table next to us. After inquiring she came back later and offered us a free shot each! What a treat! It is made in Spain with a secret recipe of 43 different liquors. They chill then liquor to make it thick and syrupy bringing some nice caramel, bourbon and gingerbread flavours out. Although we were told it is a different flavour experience for everyone that tries it; an excuse to come out and try the place! After sipping the liquor we decided it was sweet enough, and we were full enough, to pass on the delicious dessert menu. I was given a lunch coupon for next time, and I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Worth every $$ :) one of my favorite restaurant in calgary. Will defenitely come back."}
{"text":"It's Mother's Day and Pampa is open (they are usually closed on Sunday afternoons) for this special day! The boys made a reservation on Open Table and I'm glad that they did.  This place is packed (190 people seating capacity)!  All kitchen gauchos, and front of the house staff were extremely attentive, pleasant and helpful. The owners made a smart move to hire enough staff for the afternoon. Presentation and attention to detail at the salad bar was amazing.  Unlike Gaucho's, the salad bar is strategically placed in the centre of the dining area to facilitate large groups. There were also special drinks offered for the occasion; the spiced pineapple(pineapple juice with cinnamon and cloves) really hit the spot!

Salad bar items: beef carpaccio(seasoned perfectly and very tender), assorted lettuces, six different dressings and vinaigrettes, marinated mushrooms, grilled pineapple(sweet and  and capicollo, sugar snap peas, roasted beets, hearts of palm salad, pickles, salt cod tortillas, Brazilian stuffed crepes(the beef filling was okay; I found the crepe a bit too thick), focaccia, sockeye salmon scrambled eggs.  

On to the rodizio:
Beef top sirloin (Alcatra): deliciously tender and done just the way I like it (medium rare).  It was clearly one of my favourites (and my son's).
Parmesan pork loin (Lombo de Porco Marinado): seasoned perfectly though a bit tough on some spots. 
Pork belly(Leitao a Pururuca): this was absolutely to die for! The meat was juicy and tender with the crisp crackling on top.  Nom, nom...  Another favourite.
Pampa sausage (Linguica de Porco): juicy and flavourful. 
Bacon wrapped chicken thighs(Sobrecoxa de Frango com Bacom): chicken thighs were tender and juicy (kudos to the bacon wrapping).  It was a bit on the salty side.
     I finished off my awesome Mother's Day lunch with a fresh papaya and French vanilla ice cream topped at table side with Creme de Cassis liqueur.  
We will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"It has been ages since I wrote a Yelp Review.  Transitioning from California (where we experienced AMAZING food) back to our hometown of Calgary, I haven't been moved enough by any local restaurant to write a review  - that is until I ate at Pampa (twice in one week - dinner and lunch).  Service was exceptional (particularly our dinner-time server, Carlos from Columbia - we won't hold it against him that he wasn't from Brazil).  

For dinner, we even used a Groupon Deal.  Many of you who have used Groupon may understand the woes of it from time to time when service or quality of food isn't up to par.  Well this was NOT the case with Pampa.  Service from front door to our exit was excellent.  Salad bar was great - even though hubby kept warning me not to eat too much salad and save enough room for the superstars of the evening - the various cuts of meats.  Having eaten at different Brazilian steakhouses before, I can say that the cuts of meat were mouthwatering - particularly the House Special and the Lamb.  Now you may be thinking, \" But I hate Lamb!\" - trust me, my friend, you will and shall change your mind.  No gaminess in smell or taste - just flavourful and succulent.

I'm a fairly easy going gal and not difficult to please, but my hubby is picky about food - if he's going to pay a good amount for his meal, he wants it to be good quality and he wants to leave satisfied.  He prefers a hole in the wall kind of a restaurant to fancy smanchy places where he needs a burger after he leaves.  Needless to say, he raved about Pampa - something he rarely does about any restaurant.

Went back for lunch with a few friends a few days later and though the number of meats are obviously less, the experience was just as good.  

Thank you Pampa!  Keep it up and you will see us again...and again. 

p.s. only suggestion - Pampa should use the wooden blocks which you turn over for GO or Stop, which are more visible than the paper discs they use.  Still, no issue with waiters not being attentive."}
{"text":"Visited the place during their 2-1 promo which sounded like a good deal. We were a group of 6 and had made resos. They seated us at the far end of the restaurant right by the wall in a corner. The table looked small for 6 people, looked more like it was for 4. The tables around us were so close to us that we had a hard time moving back and forth to the salad bar, it was like a maze walking around all the chairs and tables around us.

Service was weird. We walked in to the restaurant and the guy at the desk was occupied, which I understand, but he just ignored us for a solid few minutes until he finished. Uh, a hello would have been nice to know that we aren't invisible. 

We sat at our table and they came by to ask if it was our first time, which it was. We were all hungry so we had our little paper things to indicate that we wanted meat but no one came by our table for a good 15 minutes until I got impatient and asked to be served. Once I complained, they basically sent everyone our way. I don't know if we were being ignored because they thought we were not ready yet or if because we were tucked away in a corner, but the servers with the meat blatantly walked past our table numerous times until I got up to complain. Was not ideal. If you have a big group, I would specifically request not to be seated in the far corner against the wall, cramped between the other two big tables. 

The salad bar was nothing special. I tried most of the dishes and my favourites were the garlic rice and the beet salad. Was hoping to see more flavourful dishes as sides, but I guess a salad bar is a salad bar and you can't expect much. 

It would be nice if they had all the meats they served on a list somewhere on the table. I had no idea what they had and were serving, and wasn't sure what I wanted to try because I could only compare once the meats were out. I just tried one of everything. 

The meats seemed a little too tough - not sure if it was the quality of the meat or if they were over cooked. Some meats were way too salty and some just didn't have much flavour to it. My favourite was the chicken with the bacon which I had multiple servings of. 

Overall, it was a lot of food for a really good deal but I'm not sure how the place is going to stick around on regular price. I have visited Bolero and Gaucho before and remember Bolero being good but I got too cheap to fork out 50$ for it and Gaucho which I thought had great sides and really flavourful meats, but how often can one go for an all you can eat Brazilian BBQ.. I'd have to try other places again to compare to more recent experiences, but I can't imagine going back to visit Pampa any time soon unless they have some kind of amazing promotion again."}
{"text":"Went for Trunch with my family, and my boys still talk about the awesome experience we had there. Very family friendly and  servers quite attentive to our boys.  Salad bar options were yummy with a good variety to compliment the meat coming around.  From the salad bar, really enjoyed the omelette!  The meats coming around were all tasty- nicely seasoned, nice textures.  Alcohol beverages were pricy- or perhaps I am just not used to the cost of cocktails these days?  Otherwise a great experience for Brazillian BBQ- with growing carnivore boys, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Nothing really surprised. Most of the beef were over cooked and lack for choices. Chicken dish only one kind.  Server was slow, took her 10 mins to fill our water or getting us the desert but friendly.  Salad bar we're good.  If they could add a desert bar would be more selling point."}
{"text":"I have to say, the service was excellent. Our server Jess was fun and engaging. She gave a terrific wine recommendation. But the food is definitely lacking. Most of the cuts that came to the table were over cooked and dry. In comparison to Boleros or Gauchos, I don't think the quality of the meats measure up. We used a Groupon for our dinner but couldn't justify it on regular price. 

Groupon price $130 (for 4) plus $80 for wine & dessert plus $45 tip. 

Regular price would have have been $275 before tip."}
{"text":"You should check it out. Food was good but meats were typically well done which was a bit of a surprise. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"We too went there for the 2 for 1 special last night and were quite disappointed.  The food itself was alright (same as others found - the meat tended to be overcooked and we were offered the same things several times) and we ordered a fair amount of drinks (prices of which were disappointing - $2 per person for tap water, $6 for juice, $60 for wine!) as well as one of each dessert on the menu.  Once the bill arrived we were dismayed to find, that for our party of 16, were were charged for 8 - however we had one child included in that party.  Rather than her meal being included in the 2 for 1, we were charged an additional $34 for her share separately.  Server sympathized and we asked management about this, but they were adamant about the charge.  $34 for a 6 year old's meal seems a bit silly to me, especially on a $1000 bill.  Not to mention the 18% gratuity.  Won't be there again."}
{"text":"We arrived early for Sunday brunch. It was a fun and relaxing experience. We fully enjoyed the mimosa but be careful, one can easily get drunk on this if not used to alcohol! The different types of meats are just awesome! Finger licking good!! I especially like the pork belly and lamb. Our server was okay but all the other gentlemen who served the various meats are very friendly. They really did take care of us.  Will totally come again!"}
{"text":"Set your discs to SIM, POR FAVOR!! (Translation: YES, PLEASE!) 

The green side of your double-sided disc signals the Rotisserie Technician Extraordinaire (I made that up just now. Edit: I learned they're actually called Gauchos) to serve you a rotating range of succulent, well-seasoned meats tableside. My personal favorites are the garlic rump steak and bacon wrapped chicken thighs. (who can resist bacon wrapped ANYTHING??!) 

The salad bar is well equipped for any omnivore. MVPs are the beef carpaccio and the thinly sliced pineapple and ham. Honorable mentions include pickled watermelon peels, pickled radishes and housemade salads. I highly recommend you jazz up the simple greens with specialty olive oils and vinegars from Edmonton's Evoolution. I'm in love with the pear and cranberry white balsamic!

The price is on par with other Brazilian BBQ spots at $45/p for dinner & $25/p for lunch. Both options offer the salad bar but lunch serves only 6 meats. The service is always top notch. The only thing stopping me from giving five stars is they charge $2/person for water. 

Alas, all good things must come to an end when the disc is inevitably flipped to red. Look on the bright side, you'll always remember the meat sweats."}
{"text":"We've been to other rodizio restaurants, but Pampa's level of service is something to write home about. For our first outing, we tried the Mother's Day special, a 5-meat subset of the normal 11-meat selection. My fave was the bacon-wrapped chicken and the grilled pork belly. From the salad bar, I most fancied the warm grilled pineapple and the beef carpaccio. Even my dessert, a dark Callebaut chocolate mousse, is worth calling out specifically. Well played, Pampa, well played."}
{"text":"Went to Pampa last night with three friends for dinner. The warm welcome to our departure, we were all very impressed. The salad bar selection was great and the selection of meats sublime. Nice atmosphere too! Would recommend to anyone that's a real meat eater."}
{"text":"We celebrated Father's day here, first time  and we loved it!! All the types of meat we tried were perfectly marinated and grilled. And the pork belly!!!!! Man.. It was so tasty."}
{"text":"If you've even been to Fogo De Chao or Texas De Brazil, don't expect this place to be anything like it. Service was good, but the food is poor quality. The salad bar is pretty basic, no cheeses or deli meats, no fruit or anything really good like you'd find at Fogo De Chao. The meats were not terrible but not delicious either and the desserts seemed store bought. I guess I had very high expectations after trying other places of the same style. Highly disappointed. Plaid over $100 for two people and it was not worth it at all. Not going back for sure."}
{"text":"Visited twice in October for their two for one special.  

The service staff was great. We didn't have to wait long for our table. You'll like what they've done with the space they have.

Meat service was prompt and you never had to wait long before someone was at your side, ready to give you delicious cuts. 

Salad bar was pretty deece but not the best.

It would be nice if you were given the option between regular tapwater and their distilled $2/person water.

If you're dt and looking to eat great food until you hate yourself, eat here."}
{"text":"Heard of this place through Facebook and saw that they had a 2 for 1 rodizio deal for September and October so I was quite intrigued by it. Took my boyfriend here for dinner and I got us reservation beforehand. We came 10 minutes prior to reservation however it took us 30-45 minutes to be seated which was quite a disappointment.

Once we got seated and took a look through the drink menu, it kind of shocked me that water was $2/person. The salad bar was alright, most of the food was gone and it took a while for the food to be brought out. Most of the meats brought out were dry, we didn't even get through all of the types of meat. They brought the same ones out about 2-3 times. I personally have been to better rodizio restaurants, maybe this one wasn't meant to be."}
{"text":"We came here for the 2-for-1 promo (which has now been extended until Nov 14th). I'm not really a big fan of Brazilian BBQS as I can never stomach that much meat but this was too good a promotion to pass up. Instead of having to pay the full dinner fare of $44.95/person, we paid $30/person ($2 for water, along with gst + gratuity). 

Pampa is a large restaurant with ample of space that gives off a comfortable vibe with its white interior. The salad bar was very extensive and of good quality. To name a few items, the salad bar included beets, cold pasta bar, broccolini, asparagus, cheese plate, beef carpaccio,  quinoa salad, mash potatoes.. etc. Its variety surpassed Bolero's salad bar imo. The only item I would suggest Pampa adding would be a fruit section, which would have been a great way to end off the end of a 2 hour long meat consumption.

The meat was of good quality and served at a good temperature. The rodizio servers were quick to approach our tables, maybe even a bit too quick. Before I knew it, my plate was stacked with a variety of meat cuts and I was eating it without really knowing what I was putting into my mouth. My favourite was the bottom sirloin and the chicken drumstick. The only thing missing from Pampa was grilled pineapple!"}
{"text":"Great meal.  Friendly staff.  Great selection.  You will never leave this place hungry."}
{"text":"Definitely did not get a good first impression from the hostesses, none of them greeted my group and they all looked seemingly unenthusiastic and just genuinely did not make us feel welcome. However, our service once we were seated was fantastic and the food was even better. Will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Good food but the variety is not that much compared to other Brazilian places I have been. A bit expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"First of all this was a very modern well kept restaurant. The service was very slow. I found the beef, lamb etc to be mostly well done, not my preference. We waited over ten minutes to get our drinks, after that the server did not come back to our table. After we finished I asked for our bill and after 10-20 min. Did not receive it. I spoke to the manager and she got it for us. We have been to other Brazilian steak houses in Calgary and this would be our last choice. Food was average, service was mediocre, atmosphere was very nice."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in we were greeted and asked if we wanted to check our coats.  The dining area is styled very contemporary, nothing amazing really stood out except for the glass wall of wine.  We were seated near the back of the restaurant which was a bit cramped.  Our server was very nice and attentive for most of the night (I had already finished my first plate before we were able to get our drink orders in).

As far as rodizio-style restaurants go it fares well.  I think it comes third in the salad bar options compared to its competition (Minhas and Goucho being first and second respectively).  I found a few of the lettuce leaves wilting and browning a bit.  They did have a good assortment of sauces for the meats (Chimichurri being one) but they failed to provide small sauce bowls and so you had to either bring your meats up to the salad bar or use one of the soup bowls.

The meats were good and on par with other rodizio restaurants in Calgary.  The selection that Wednesday night was 11 different meats.  I found a few to be a bit too salty and after dinner I had to chug about 3 glasses of water just to get the salty taste out of my mouth.

The desserts I'd have to say are excellent here.  We tried the cheesecake and we were surely  delighted.  They used a digestive cookie crust (as opposed to graham crackers) which I didn't really taste the difference.  The cheesecake itself was the star here.  They also topped it off with a condense milk sauce.  At $11 it was a bit pricey for a slice of cheesecake; shared between two people the price was easier to swallow.

It was a great dinner but I don't know if I'd return if I had to pay full price.  We used a Groupon and so our entire dinner with tip, soft drinks (didn't feel like the house wine or beer that night), dessert and tax came out to $70.  At that price, $35/person feels worth it.  Had we not used a Groupon we would have spent well over $100.  Special occasions or to impress a client is what I'd go back for."}
