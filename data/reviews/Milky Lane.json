{"text":"Great little spot for a frosty treat, although they have savory treats too. Had a tough time deciding what to order. The waitress was very helpful in explaining the menu. We ordered two sundaes, one with chocolate and the other with caramel and chocolate malted milk balls. Both were delish. Will go hungry next time and try a crepe. So nice to find a family-run shop. Nice place and nice people."}
{"text":"The nice man there have us good recommendations, we tried some ice cream flavors (the scoops, since the nicecream is just vanilla soft serve) we ended up getting the black tie crepe with red velvet cheesecake ice cream. Really good!"}
{"text":"I love my ice cream, and it is always nice when I can go out and get some good ice cream. I like generic chocolate ice cream, and you would be surprised how different all of the different chocolate flavors are. Milky Lane had some fantastic chocolate ice cream. It was absolutely delicious. My son had the lime milk shake and he loved it. The place was small and cozy and the service was really good. I enjoyed my experience and I would love to return."}
{"text":"Milky Lane is located in a plaza and customers can park in any of the parking lots adjacent to the restaurant. If you want to be exact, parking at Shoppers Drug Mart is further lols however you can still climb over the grass to Milky Lane. The building has a red rooftop and is beside the T&T Supermarket entrance.  I'm pretty biased in this review (for once lols) because the service was phenomenal. How often do I land myself in a restaurant where the service is better than the food? Rarely. Honestly. The place was super short-staffed and (I'm guessing) the owner was serving everyone by himself (i.e. cooking too?). Anyhow he was very personable and cracked a few jokes while interacting with all the customers. The place doesn't look too cheerful, almost a little dim but I felt comfortable. The food is average at best and the sauces that come with the sweet crepes were a little frozen lols. My suggestion is that you wait a bit before squeezing out the stuff on your crepes. It's like finding a gem in a treasure box when service is this genuine and sincere, so my rating for this place is a little exaggerated. I actually prefer the savoury crepes because it had more of a kick (or spiciness to it). Overall the restaurant isn't bad, but the crepes were nothing special compared to other dessert places."}
{"text":"Not a 5 just because of the decor and atmosphere but otherwise really great food and service."}
{"text":"loved the family-owned feel of this restaurant. tried the crepe with blueberries and strawberries inside. didn't care too much for the blueberries but I've never really been a fan of them. I would've preferred for the actual crepe to have been thinner as it had more of a pancake feel to it but it still tasted great. I really loved the syrups i was given along with my crepe so that i could add whatever i'd like. I've also tried their burger and fries they were both pretty generic but definitely a good value for the price. I was more in to the burger than the fries because i felt like the taste of oil overpowered the taste of the fries. All in all it was a great experience especially because the owner came out to socialize with everyone and even refilled everyones drinks."}
{"text":"A small business owned by a lovely family. The variety of desserts is amazing. If you get a waffle or a sundae, they ring a variety of syrups to your table.   They also have great savory options at a really good price! If you like samosas, you have to come here. $5 for 5! They also have burger/fry kind of options too.   I'm all about supporting the little guy, especially if they're good! This is a must visit spot."}
{"text":"Nice place. Family owned. Great service and small and cozy. Sits 30 inside (possible make shift patio coming this summer). Prices are reasonable. Majority of the manu is deserts but you can find some other items too. To find it fast look for blinds to go ! Its right beside it. I will come back.   Important note ! On weekend they have load based hours so call and they might be still open !"}
{"text":"I've seen this place popped up in that T n T plaza for a while now, and I've been dying to see it ever since.  I've heard about this chain in South Africa...   Anyways, we went around 12pm on like a tuesday, so obviously it was kinda empty. But while we sat, a few people still popped in for some takeout!  I had the pepper steak pot pie.   GURL IT WAS FABULOUS.  See here's the thing about pepper steak..there's the way you white people do it here in canada or whatever, which is fine, but not really what im used to. THen there's the way that they do it back in Africa..which is PHENOMENAL.  And thats exactly what it tasted like. It reminded me so much of my childhood..and home..I was almost in tears. Like legit.  Also, it was only like 5 bux.  5. yea.  I did notice that they also have a butter chicken pot pie. I know what I'm getting next time.  My sister had the burger...and it was deceptively huge. You could totally tell that the patty was handmade with love.   For desert, we obvs had the choc 99 in a sundae.  What is that you ask?  A bowl/sundae thing filled with nice cream (their version of super soft and fresh soft serve) WITH A CADBURY FLAKE JUST CHILLING IN DA MIDDLE.  (google cadbury flake if you dont know what this is)  (how could you not)   SO GOOD PS.  I will defo be back. The decor is cute, I love the mural on the wall with their logo.  The owner was super nice as well. She came over and said hi to us while we were waiting for our food..oh and to let us know that the pie takes 20 mins. (Which isn't that long, was happy to wait)  Stuff I wanna try for next time:  The Whizzers!   Any of the savoury waffles..like the mexican one. Looks sooo good.  So much more. Ugh need bigger stomach and wallet.  In the end:  I LOVE THIS PLACE.  I WILL BE BACK SOON.  (whenever my sister wants to drive me back there)  PS, i always see that this place is packed in the evenings..I guess it's a regular haunt for the high school kids in RH.   I suggest going earlier on in the day then.  I kinda hate high school kids.  #SorryNotSorry"}
{"text":"Visited this place last night. Looking for a new dessert place to try out. Let me tell you this is one that is going to be on my regular weekly schedule to visit. Staff is friendly and very polite, can definitely tell that they are striving to be the best. Dessert is amazing come with options of both savory and sweet. Ice cream is to die for and the pot pies are unbelievable.  Recommend to everyone to try it out Highly recommend!!   *Recommend the butter chicken pies! ;)"}
{"text":"This is a great little dessert place that's a refreshing alternative to the regular chains. The soft serve really is above average - very creamy and a bit sweeter than usual. If I lived close by it would be a go to for getting together with friends in a relaxed and quiet environment. Plus this a great throw back to the south African roots! Definitely give this place a go!"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic and their \"nice cream\" (soft serve) beats McDonald's by miles. Will be coming back often!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Came out on a Friday night and the place was empty. Except the Strawberry sundae, which was decent, the ice creams weren't good (surprising that a chocolate ice cream could be so meh). The place seemed a little shabby with utensils and the kitchen in full view - and it's not a pretty chef's kitchen."}
{"text":"Milky Lane is just so sweet!   From their pink pastel menu, the crepes/waffles to the sweet waitress.   The vibe here is totally family friendly even on a Saturday night.   Peppermint Aero Waffles ($8.95) with soft served vanilla chocolate twist made my friend smiled. An assortment of syrups on the table to customized to your personal taste.   Closes at 12:30 am on Saturday. I definitely will be back to Milky Lane for dessert next time!! (to use my buy 1 get 1 free coupon!!!)"}
{"text":"Coming on a Friday night, I was surprised this place wasn't oozing with people but it was still a full house!  Although they were short staffed, the waiter made sure we were served promptly.  Going through the menu, there is a wide variety of desserts, hot food (snacks) and drinks. They have something called \"nice cream\" which is their own soft served ice cream and you are given a variety of syrups to drizzle over your crÃªpe/waffle. The seven syrups given to you in a squeeze bottle include chocolate, maple syrup, honey, golden syrup, butterscotch, caramel, and strawberry.   I ordered the red ribbon crepe and had some of my friend's chocolate banana waffle and everything was delicious!   Would come back because of the menu variety, friendly service and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We had a sundae which had yummy malt balls, fries with toppings which were yummy and these chicken paprika samosas that we are defiantly going back for ! Great service"}
{"text":"its really sad and depressing for me to see this place...  in all honesty i dont think it will last much longer... it seems like a struggling business...   the food is \"so so\" ... but its really the service you pay for.  i cant help it feel like its a charity case coming here... i feel like im only coming here to help this poor family out... its a family business and everyone contributes.  the father is struggling to make ends meet and you can see him trying his hardest to please the customers.. however, the food is mediocre to me.   presentation can improve...  i could be wrong with their family situation and maybe they are rich.. but i feel guilty and sad when i go there.. thats why i wont be returning..   if i wanted to feel that way.. i would watch those sad ass \"for only a dollar a day... you can help a child\" commercials on sundays.   you know what im talking about.. with sarah mclachlan in the background.  this is really a pity 3 stars.. i feel bad for even writing this.. :(    service was good though!"}
