{"text":"Usual atmosphere, unusually excellent food - 
It's all about the food here.  The atmosphere is typical Marriott restaurant (but clean) and since it part bar it can get crowded and loud.  Service tries their best, but on busy nights they can easily get swamped. I've been eating here a couple of times a week for 6+ months, and I haven't gotten tired of the restaurant.  The menu changes every month or so and I've tried just about everything on the menu.  They locally source most of their ingredients and the chef's come up with some really creative and excellent entrees.  They have an excellent \"lite\" menu for dinners.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This is the main restaurant within the Cleveland Marriott East.  Menu selection is limited but the quality is well above average.  The ambiance is what most would expect from an establishment that sits within the lobby of a major hotel.  Dress code is flexible for obvious reasons.  We had about a dozen people in our party and were pleased with the service until about half way through the meal, at which point its like our servers left the building.  They didnt but something changed and we became quite frustrated with the level of service - to the point where several folks who were interested in dessert decided to pass.

This area of Cleveland has numerous high-quality places for business meetings - I'd look around a little bit further before recommending this place, especially for important dinner meetings."}
{"text":"This is where you eat when your flight is delayed and you are too tired to get real food. I had a poorly prepared martini, an OK ribeye steak, cold baked potato, and some nasty broccolini that I could not finish. Now I can sleep. Marriott needs to get rid of this out of date and never-was-good concept."}
{"text":"The food and ambiance are pretty standard (and keep me from rating 5 stars).  What sets this place apart, is Michael, the bartender.  He'll remember your name and your drink(s) of choice, even with long intervals between visits.  Every little bit of familiarity helps when you're travelling and makes deciding between the Marriott and the Doubletree an easy decision (even though my rewards points are with Hilton)."}
{"text":"Breakfast buffet two days in a row now since the concierge lounge is not open on the weekend.  The first day - server was attentive, cleared plates etc.  The second day - service non existent...was told about cooked to order eggs and asked for a hard boiled egg...twenty minutes later gave up on waiting and left...food is mediocre"}
{"text":"For an in house, Marriott restaurant, this place exceeded my expectations.  A tad pricey, but the rib eye was well prepared.  The risotto was a bit thick.  And the baked potato was, well, a baked potato.  The wine selection was fairly thin.  But the service was fine.  If you're staying at the hotel, need a place to eat, and don't want to venture outside, this is not a step down, but a nice surprise."}
{"text":"My family and I had Thanksgiving here. We were sitted immediately and they took our drinks order then appetizer order. The thanksgiving meal was already planned out and we knew what they would be serving .

After we finished our salad we must have waited about 20 minutes before our waiter came and brought us our plates. The restaurant was less than full. When we finished once again we sat and sat and could not locate our waiter. I finally asked another server if he could get him. It still took another another 10 minutes for him to show up. After dessert we went through the same thing with him and had to ask another worker to get him and again it took a very long time. We were all wondering what he was doing in the back and our conclusion was that he was watching football? Finally he showed up and gave us our checks and the wait started again. After another worker saw our displeasure she kindly picked up our checks for us. 

This was supposed to be a nice family holiday dinner. It's one I want to forget as I left disgusted. The food was less than mediocre. I also really felt bad for my 83 yr old mother. We will not come back to the restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"Toddler friendliness environment: 5 stars 
Food: standard American fair...nothing worth noting...too salty even...yet to try more

When you are a parent with a walking toddler, you judge restaurants on a different level. You know what I said about ambience is not important before? Totally not true. I realized that now. Young and silly me.

1. This restaurant sits inside Marriott lobby. The whole place is thick-carpeted through out.  Your toddler can fall backward and sideways and won't get hurt.

2. It was such a pleasure to change diaper in the restroom. Especially I just changed diaper on the floor in the restroom in another establishment a couple days ago.

3. The water fountain and lights in the lobby calm a teething soul: moms know best. Babies love lights. The constant flowing water provide a focal point. When they finish meals they want to go check it out.

When your kid is happy, any food on the table taste delicious."}
{"text":"This River City Grille is located inside the Cleveland Marriott East Hotel.

I've stayed at his hotel a number of times, thus I've eaten dinner and breakfast in here several times.

Service for breakfast is spotty - meaning they don't seem to have enough staff. I waited at the entrance for about 10 minutes the last time before someone showed up to seat me. And I noted that others showed up, waited a while, then left when no one was around to seat them. Folks that were seated, some of them waited some time before a server showed up to greet them and take their order.

The food has been pretty good. If the service issue were not such a big thing, I'd give them 3-4 stars.

C'mon Marriott! Let's improve the service here!

{"text":"This must be the worst food I've ever had. My daughters sliders were so dry & her chicken wings raw. 
Cocktail shrimp was chewy. 
The service was SO SLOW! Don't eat there!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the cook of my steak, the price was amazingly high for what I received and the response time was horrible - from the server to the time it took to get things - I've had to deal with much worse though and I would certainly give this place another try! This was my second time here - first was ok - this time not so good - next time I'm hoping for better!"}
{"text":"I hate being the only table seated at a restaurant & that is exactly what happened here on a Saturday evening .. limited menu .. ordered the filet & it was cooked near perfectly .. the spinach was average but the risotto was totally gross .. it was like glue .. no way did they use the proper rice .. it was so sticky & broken down that it was obviously just regular white rice .. I asked for the mashed potatoes in its place when I found it inedible & that was quickly brought to me & I did enjoy it .. not ONCE did our server ask if we wanted anything but water so we did not order anything .. I figure if he wants to not up-sell us on a beverage he can make a smaller tip .. he was attentive only because he had to be but he seemed more bothered that we dare enter the empty restaurant .. will not be back .. tried it w/an Entertainment Book Coupon so at least we saved 25 bucks .."}
{"text":"Have been staying at the hotel for a few weeks and visit this place regularly. The food is amazing and if you get a chance to hang at the bar ask for Mike, he will definitely take care of you!!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Make sure to ask for Mike at the bar, he does a great job and makes you feel welcome. The ribeye was cooked perfectly and my drink was always full. I will definitely be back when I'm out this way for business."}
