{"text":"Well...I really wanted to like it, but it wasn't great. With all the choices we have, this one won't make the cut for us."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food I have had in a long time, maybe ever. 

I ordered a shrimp street taco and had to pull the tails off the shrimp if I wanted to eat it. Pulled the tails off but passed on the taco, veggies and shrimp were greasy. 

I also ordered a crispy machaca taco. It had more jalapeno in it than meat. It came still folded with the lettuce and pico in the side for me to put together. It broke into pieces when I opened it and when I saw the insides, I passed on that, as well. 

I kindly paid and split, totally disappointed. I knew I should have ran when I walked in and there was a dirty Kleenex on the counter."}
{"text":"This place is great. All the food has great flavor and everything is made fresh. The tortillas  are homemade are and are really good we had to get and extra order to take home, they make em fresh when u order your food."}
{"text":"Bomb.com I've never written a review, but I had to for this place. The food is so good. I got a super burrito and it was super big. You gotta come try this place."}
{"text":"The thin and fresh chips are delicious!! They brought out hot beans and fresh salsa. Free refills on chips and salsa.  The food was pretty good. I loved the fresh corn tortillas. The burrito has fresh homemade tortilla as well. They served our food with green and red salsa. Free refills on our jamica and horchata. Service was great!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight. My expectations were low as I am very picky about my Mexican food. I like it authentic. I got the Chile relleno and it was yummy. It had wonderful flavor and was cooked to perfection. I was pleasantly surprised. It was real authentic Mexican food, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The service was great, and the restaurant was clean. I will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"Super Authentic Mexican food!!! Great flavor, reminds me of home!!! Homage tortillas are amazing. The agua frescas are amazing!! If you like menudo and know what it is, it's a great choice to eat!!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 8 people and the service was good. This is an official mom &a pop restaurant. I had a cheese and a chick enchilada with rice and beans. Between order time and food it was fairly quick. Fun fact: most of all their decorations are imported directly from Mexico! Great place to go!!"}
{"text":"Such a random find! Stopped to have a beer with quesadilla. The food was awesome!!!! They also have French fries covered in cheese and carne asada! Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great! The complimentary bean & salsa dip was amazing! The agua frescas are a must! There was a small mix up with the drinks which was later rewarded with a complimentary drink. I asked for a different kind of salsa to eat with my burrito & they made me a fresh batch!!!! Very kind & thoughtful staff."}
{"text":"The gorditas are made fresh!!! I had chicharron and red chile sauce. 
The owner was very cordial and we totally enjoyed our food!"}
{"text":"WOW!  This place is great!  My husband and I went on a Saturday night, around 6:30. It was super quiet, so I was a little worried.  I'm glad we went in because the food was fantastic!!! The flavors were yummy and the meat was very tender! I had the carne asada and my husband had the street tacos.  The salsa on the table is green and by far the best I've had!  Just the right amount of kick and flavor!  The restaurant was beautiful and my husband (a plumber) said they did a nice job remodeling it. Please try this place so that it can stick around! 

PS The tortillas were AWESOME!"}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Mexican food places I've had in a very long while. You must have the fajitas and their Mexican corn."}
{"text":"After passing by this place serval times and seeing the reviews, we finally decided to give it a try. We were immediately seated and waiter took our drink order right away. Kids drinks are bottomless refills of horchata, how awesome is that! We also had 2 micheladas, they were sooo tasty! And we are very picky about our miches. The chips and salsa and bean dip to start were very good, we had to stop ourselves from eating too much of it. Ordered the shrimp cooked in garlic/butter, pozole, beef taco & enchilada combo plate and kids nuggets and bean burritos. All the food was excellent, the service was beyond great. They really took care of us here. Parking is minimal, so just beware. Great place overall, and will be back. Thank you."}
{"text":"Awesome service, awesome food, awesome portions and reasonable prices!

All the food tasted homemade because... It was!

You must go to this place just please don't come with my family wants to because parking is limited."}
{"text":"Eating here for the 1st time and really enjoyed it. I had the carna asada super chimichanga. Huge portion and very tasty! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Very good food. I had the shooter burrito. I was expecting it on a plate and eaten with silverware. But it came in a basket and was eaten with my hand. I had the pastor burrito and it was very good. It had good flavor. We had the corn appetizer and it was good. The service was good also. 
My only complaint would be the parking. It is very limited. We had to patrol down the street and walk, although not far.. It's not their fault I guess but don't expect to park nearby. It is possible it won't happen."}
{"text":"Love the food, especially their street tacos. Cute little place with a friendly staff. Has quickly become a weekly habit! Will add pics as soon as I figure out how..."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!! Do not listen to any of the reviews! It must be all there staff just standing around reviewing it. First off there salsa tastes like pico de gallo that they got from a store then they blended them selves and there chips taste like there from a bag! There water tastes like sewage water, not even drinkable!!! We also ordered tacos and the chicken was undercooked, the steak was horrible and the Carnitas was all fat and hard pieces!!! So save your self the trip and do not go here unless you want food poisoning!!! God bless these people!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Felt bad that I even choose this place for dinner with my family. Had heard good things about his place through a local social media group, boy were they ever wrong!!!

First off, it looks like it is family ran business which I am all for. However, the \"wait staff\" is just a teenage boy and a woman. Neither seem to have ANY knowledge of waiting tables. The house salsa and chips are not great. The house salsa has a real chunky and watery consistency to it. It's super spicy and totally under seasoned. Pretty much just tasted it and said nope. The bean dip is ok, but again under seasoned.

For dinner I ordered the steak ranchero. Immediately the boy asks me how I would like my steak cooked. Red flag raised as bistec ranchero is always finished in sauce and should never have any pink to it. 
Husband ordered the carne asada plate and again the boy asks how he would like his steak. Normally we don't expect to get asked on the doneness of beef at Mexican restaurants. We ordered the quesadilla for the kiddo. The quesadilla was definitely small. When our food is finally out, the boy kept asking what else can we get for you. How about the rest of our order like tortillas and my kids quesadilla. They brought out a huge side plate of rice and beans which was supposed to be the sides for the quesadilla. When they finally bring my son's quesadilla, it's on a plate with more rice and beans. Normally, this wouldn't be a big deal but when we are charged extra for a plate of rice and beans because of a kitchen error, it's not cool. After about ten minutes of asking for our tortillas, I finally went up to the counter and asked for them. I waited another few minutes at the counter and when I get to the table I realize they only
put in three small flour tortillas for two entrees! 

At this point, we are just ready to leave and never return. No one came and asked how everything was or tasted. The service and kitchen management is definitely lacking here. When we finally get the bill and notice the extra charge for the side plate of rice and beans which we didn't order or eat we didn't even fight it. We just wanted to get the hell out of there. It definitely made for a stressful night having to chase the waitstaff and to continuously remind them for the rest of our food. I would personally NEVER return here. But I do hope that they can figure out how to better manage their kitchen and have a better ticket system in place. Training or hiring new waitstaff would also be a must."}
{"text":"Brand new place in Chandler. Food was good. I ordered the chicken tacos dorados with rice and beans.  Restaurant is cozy and clean. The staff was friendly and food came out quickly. Will come back again in the near future."}
{"text":"This place feels like your at someone's house yet it is big and decorated greatly. They are very nice there and let you sample the soups. The menudo was great. I must go back to try more things. Get the elote!"}
{"text":"A decade ago I lived in Southern California and enjoyed a plethora of amazing Mexican food options, the best being homemade.  Since then, I have mostly been disappointed by Mexican restaurants, most of which are mediocre.  However, I can truthfully say that Casa Maria stands out as the best Mexican restaurant I've been to in years.  I got the carne asada, elote preparada and horchata- all of which were delicious.  The place was clean and the service unbeatable.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican restaurant! The owners son waited on us very friendly and great at explaining the menu and the different food options. My husband went with tacos his favorite were the carne asada and el pastor. I went with the surf and turf burrito super style. It was phenomenal and the homemade salsas on top just made the food that much better.  Great tortillas! Will definitely be back! Our new go to Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"Food was great, our waitress was nice and polite..clean atmosphere. we will be going there again."}
{"text":"We picked this restaurant after reading a couple good reviews online. The food is absolutely delicious, huge portions, and our server, Raul, has been extremely attentive and awesome. The chips are great, homemade tomatillo salsa cannot be beat.  I would definitely come back, my husband had pork Carnitas, extremely flavorful. 

The kids portions are also very generous. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really good sopes! They were delicious, authentic and freshly made. My only complaint was that they were small for the price, but out of the 3 other restaurants I've found that serves sopes (all in Chandler), this one is not only decent but delicious. Will definitely come back. (I got Carne Asada)"}
{"text":"Went to Casa Maria last night. Came to the restaurant because of the good reviews. Wanted some good Mexican food. Well you won't find it here. The chips were good but that is where it ended. I had the steak fajitas, they were over cooked they poured more sauce to hide it. The onions were over cooked and not a lot of them. The peppers were ok. My husband had a shrimp dish that was served with French fries. Strange. The worst thing was he was up all night sick to his stomach. I will spare you the details.

You can tell they are really trying. Our food took a really long time. The waiter/cook apologized for the wait, said his cook called in sick. But...there were 5 other people behind the counter and in the kitchen. The table next to us threatened to leave because their food was taking so long. We won't be back. This place is a train wreck!"}
{"text":"This place is really good. Everything is fresh, tastes good and the staff is friendly and attentive. The corn tortillas are even homemade. We really enjoyed our dinner and will definitely be back to try the authentic al pastor cooked on a spit, our server assured us they would be starting to serve soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service.  If you've been in before, it's worth a second look.  They recently revamped their menu, and the food comes out much faster now.  They're very cool about asking for custom touches too (like don't include cilantro, or add extra cheese, etc.).  Definitely get the Al Pastor Super Taco.  Epic."}
{"text":"I'm very picky about Mexican food. This place is great! I especially love the elote preparada (roasted corn on the cob with crema, queso, and chili powder). It could very well be the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really good!!!! Shrimp with garlic butter was delicious!!! Definitely try this place"}
{"text":"Decided to go here on a whim since it just opened around the corner. My husband and I are very picky on Mexican food and are usually harsh critics. We were greeted and seated immediately. It was very clean and service was great. The food was great and the price was good. This is likely to become a favorite of ours."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my new regular stops! Flavorful food with amazing service. They start you out with chips, salsa and bean dip and I'd recommend the queso fundido appetizer served with ample chorizo smothered in cheese. Our table ordered a mixture of tacos, one gordita, and the enchilada plate- we were not disappointed! The shrimp taco was cooked perfectly and the gordita had a nice thick tortilla. The $5 margaritas top off the whole experience leaving us very full and satisfied!"}
{"text":"True example of down home cooking. This is a cute little restaurant tucked away off AZ Ave. The restaurant is clean and the young men who wait on you are polite and more then happy to bring you their very delicious dips and sauces"}
{"text":"Great new Chandler restaurant! Chips and salsa came with bean dip that was delicious . Staff was very attentive and we all enjoyed our meals"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Delightful service. Family owned. We walked in at 1:30 on a Friday afternoon. The place had finished with their busy lunch service. We were seated promptly. The owners son was our waiter. We ordered our drinks right away. A Pacifico and yummy Mango Margarita. Started with shredded beef taquitos. So good! They came with sour cream and guacamole. I had the carnitas soaps and hubby the special tacos, carne asada. Large portions. They were short a chef and appeared to have a big to go order. Our food was a little slow but the chips and salsa made up for the wait. Also the delicious margarita helped too. We will make this our regular place to eat and to go. It's nice to have another family owned restaurant in Chandler."}
{"text":"Delicious! Very quaint restaurant with only 10-12 tables inside, but carry out is available. They start you off with chips, creamy bean dip and salsa. All were excellent. Salsa is medium spicy, but not hot. Just how I like it. 
My husband had the super burrito with carne asada. It was huge and he said he was really good. I had carne asada street tacos. They are small but authentic and very tasty. The homemade corn tortillas are wonderful. We also each had a sopas with pork carnitas. Absolutely awesome! 
We would highly recommend this place and we will be back. Don't let the parking lot scare you away. It's tiny but this place is worth the visit."}
{"text":"On a Sunday looking for real mexican food, menuedo and came across this gem. Ayeeee muy fantastic menuedo white or red. Homemade corn tortillas. Service friendly and fast. The owner Raul super nice. Five stars does not do this place justice. You have to try this place, even if you have to drive a little further you will not regret it. I give reviews just about everywhere I try and have to share a Gem when one is found."}
{"text":"There should be a button for no stars,  that's what I would give this place. Food took FOREVER, over 40 minutes and when I got my cheese enchiladas the cheese wasn't even melted or warm for that matter.  Full on ridiculous!!  We were the last ones to get our uncooked food even though we were there before other people.  I'm not one to pull the race card but maybe if we were brown it would have been better. We were the only white people in there. Maybe that's why? We will never go here again."}
{"text":"Service is swift and kind.  Started with some chips and really fresh salsa and bean dip, delicious! I ordered the cheese enchilada plate.  There was a slight cinnamon flavor to the red sauce but it was great.   This came with beans and rice which was slightly salty, but I like salt so I thought it was wonderful.   DH ordered the Barria de Chivo, the goat stew.   It was loaded with meat and again had a slight cinnamon flavor.  He also had a chicken street taco which was just average.   I would defiantly return if not just for the fresh salsa."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend, third-time. The first two were amazing so we came back! The food is always prepared better than my expectation and the free chips, salsa and beans, you can't go wrong! My favorite Mexican restaurant by far!"}
{"text":"Went here with my husband and the food and service were great! I ordered the enchilada style burrito and not only was the portion generous but it was delicious too! I will definitely be back here again. 
Also, don't forget to try the $5 margaritas!!!"}
{"text":"This family-owned and run restaurant dishes up some of the very best authentic Mexican food I've eaten anywhere! Each item was scratch made and especially flavorful; the chips, bean dip, salsas, meats, refritos, tacos, quesadilla and margaritas. On top of the food, the Manager and Owners' friendliness and attentiveness made our experience refreshingly personalized. I highly recommend Casa Maria Mexican Grill!"}
{"text":"Huge portions, you are not going to starve here. Excellent tasting food.  Homemade salsa, which is served with your food. Ask for horchata,; it's not on the menu - yum-o!! It's homemade as well. Service was really good; they made sure we were taken care of.

They were out of margaritas, so sad for me :(  About the only negative I saw was the parking. Which is not a deterrent for us to not come back."}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is delicious and the people are friendly.
I think we have tried almost everything on the menu. Carnitas Super Tacos & Burritos are my favorite. My husband likes the carne asada (fries, street tacos, super tacos or burritos. 
Margaritas & Beer are served along with Coke products, lemonade & tea."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The seating area was clean and spacious. They have beer, which is always a plus with carne asada. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today for lunch. I ordered the menudo, it was a large portion. The menudo was really good, it came with a toasted bolillo or you could order tortillas. Food was good, service was good. I would come back and I would recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Food is good, but this place seems understaffed. It is small, but I still think they could benefit from some more help. Order took way longer than it should have. Parking is also difficult, so be aware of that before coming here. I didn't try any of their drinks, but next time I come by I'll do that and update my review. This is more 3.5/5, but I rounded up."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place last week. My best friend was visiting the States and I am from out of town.  She's stationed in Korea and longs for Authentic Mexican food. This was the perfect place for just that. As a Mexican I really appreciated the authenticity in their dishes. I love garlic shrimp but am usually disappointed that it gets served with red rice at restaurants but even that they nailed and gave me a side of white rice, just like my momma would have made it.  The garlic shrimp were extreamly garlicy and I loved it. Service could have been a little better I was asked if I wanted any thing else and my drink refill never came we also had 2 toddlers with us and when we asked for water for them initially they brought us regular cups. You could tell the young man that served us is still learning his way around but he was really nice.  I enjoyed the salsa tasting home made like everything else I cannot stand pace sauce or any thing that tastes like it when I first tasted it and the bean dip I knew I was in for good meal."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite mexican places to  eat at. My boyfriend and i come here all the time!! 5 stars definitely."}
{"text":"Very good food and excellent service!!!  Best salsa I've had in a long time!!!!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place had really good Mexican food. The food is indeed very fresh and uses high quality ingredients. We order the nachos, corn and shrimp cocktail. Delicious and very fresh! And they have free chips and salsa as appetizer. The service is friendly, so if you are in the area check this place out."}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge foodies. We have a hate love relationship with trying new places such as this establishment. We ordered two super carne asada burritos. We had ordered almost every meat on the menu except for the chicken(we ordered it and they never gave it to us) and chicharron. I enjoyed probably the pastor the most out of all the meats but not enough to where I'm going to come back. I think they honestly gave us two carne tacos instead of one chicken one carne. The carne was okay. Shockingly the shrimp was my least favorite which is bizarre because I LOVE  shrimp. 

My husband after eating 3 bites of his lack of carne asada burrito and complained about how mushy the rice was looked over and said you can even make better food than this. For my husband to say that about
Mexican food is really bad. Mexican cooking is definitely not my forte what so ever. I can grill up some meat from el rancho market and get some tortillas but it's nothing home made like anything else i make. 


Such a disappointment we had such high hopes. But this is also what tends to happen when you order take out as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to have lunch at Casa Maria Mexican Grill, and we had the best Mexican food we had ever had before, we highly recommend it to anybody, their Chile rellenos and their rolled taquitos are delicious!"}
{"text":"Place is a hole in a wall but it's good.. price could be a little better but all in all not bad.."}
{"text":"Service and food was great. Don't mind a re-visit when i get back there. thought we could only find great Mexican food in SF. Equally satisfying. Will be back for more great food on my next visit to Chandler, AZ."}
{"text":"Finally tried Casa Maria Mexican Grill after seeing multiple posts by friends on Facebook. The food was great, restaurant was clean and the owner was very nice and came and introduced himself. We went in after looking for various restaurants service tacos de lengua and Casa Maria had the best tasting ever, not to mention the chips and salsa was very tasty. We will certainly be back soon to try more."}
{"text":"Good, quick service. Delicious food! Loved the corn tortillas and tacos. Absolutely will be back!"}
{"text":"Casa Maria is honestly the first Mexican restaurant in AZ that I have been to that has true authentic flavors and dishes. The asada fajitas with he HAND MADE tortillas were amazing! I saw the cook make the tortillas in front of us..my wife had the super burrito enchilada style which was amazing and my uncle got the camarones a la diabla which was actually spicy and rich in flavor! nobody does it like Casa Maria! Also u can't beat $5 Margaritas! Def will be back again!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent but I've had much better. My taco didn't even look like a taco but it was more of a burrito. The salsa they give you is horrible and the bean dip isn't great. Service is verrry slow. I ordered an iced tea, around lunch time period, and they said we will get it. Later, I asked for it again and he said he was going to get it. People who came in after me got all of their drinks. I finished my food, without any drinks or offering of water. I nearly choked on my food a couple of times. When I left I told the manager and he said that they had to make the tea and asked I if I wanted the tea cause it was ready. I'm like, really? I already ate. They never offered me water. It would have been nice to know that they didn't have any tea. Should have been said in the beginning."}
{"text":"Hate having to leave a bad review anywhere, but I have to in hopes of saving someone else the experience we had. I rely heavily on Yelp reviews when deciding where to eat. 4.5 stars? Really? My only guess is that they have their 13 reviews from family because they've only been open a month and there's no way this restaurant would get that. Not only was the food not good at all, but to top it off  this was the worst experience I've had anywhere in a looooooong time. It's nothing personal- I mean the service was pretty bad but it wasn't like they were outright rude. It was just more like they had absolutely zero personality, no friendliness or even knowledge of the menu. If that was the only problem I had then I'd still give them 3 stars, BUT it was only the tip of the iceberg. Where do I start? There was a short brown curly hair in the bean dip, not found until it ended up in my kid's mouth. So gross. Wanted to leave right then as I have no tolerance for that kind of nastiness, but I didn't want to be rude and tried to tell myself it was a one-off thing. I got halfway through my food when I saw a hair hanging off my plate. As if that wasn't bad enough- we got the bill and realized they had charged us for so many extra things that they never made clear would be extra. Would you care if the food was actually good, but to be charged extra for a meal that we didn't like or even want to stick around long enough to eat was just beyond terrible. I asked if the fajitas would come with guacamole and she said \"I don't know but I'll bring you a little side\". Low and behold- it's on the bill! She asked what kind of meat we wanted in our entrees and named off chicken, carne asada, etc. No additional price is listed on the menu nor did she mention it, but carne asada upcharged  on the bill! They kept asking us if we wanted more tortillas for our fajitas so we finally said yes as they kept coming back and asking. Yup! Extra charge on the bill! (Didn't even use them as we were pretty grossed out by this point.) Halfway into our visit a man comes out from the kitchen area to ask if it's our first time there and says \"welcome\". That was the one show of decent customer service, but unfortunately it only added to the bad experience as he was dripping in sweat- literally looked like he just jumped into a swimming pool. We are only guessing he's back there cooking and most likely sweat is dripping off him and all over the food. I'd say that was the final straw, but it wasn't. The final straw was all of us feeling really not well after we left. Thought maybe it was in our heads due to all the disgusting things we experienced, but no- my kids have started getting upset stomachs in the hours since we left. I should have left at first sight of the initial hair in the bean dip. Hoping my kids get over their illness fast and that my husband and I don't follow suit. I feel yucky, but can't tell at this point if I'm disgusted or getting food poisoning like my kids. Either way- one things for sure- I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. I want to support local businesses and especially ppl just starting out, but I can't care enough to do that when they obviously don't care about their patrons feelings or (more importantly) health. If you're not going to have good service or decent food, by all means at least provide a minimum level of cleanliness so ppl don't get sick. Stay far away!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the employees extremely pleasant. Gave them 4 stars because service was a little slow however it was definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Our server, Raul, was the BOMB! He was very informative, funny, with tons of personality. All of the food is made in house. Fresh, tasty, & delicious. The margaritas are HUGE, and inexpensive. WE WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Mexican food!!! If you want a taste of real homemade Mexican meal, Casa Maria is the place. Warm tasty handmade tortillas, homemade salsa (it reminds me of my mom's salsa)."}
{"text":"Loved it, My Husband and I just ate here. Very friendly staff. We both had the carnitas plate. The pork was to die for and the corn tortillas are homemade and wonderful. We definitely will be back. Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"The people here are super friendly, the food is very authentic. I was tired of all the drive thru fast food Mexican places that all end in \"bertos\". I wanted some delicious, real Mexican food and I found it here. This place is so close to my house is hard not to stop here every other day! It's that good."}
{"text":"This place is great. Salsa is terrific with the right amount of heat. Chips with beans. Okay I literally licked the bean bowl clean. 

I ordered the carne asada served as a full steak. It was made to order and I didn't wait long. Really good flavor and portion for the money."}
{"text":"My wife and I visit this restaurant every other week. I will say the first time I went I almost walked out because it took forever to get service. I'm so happy I didn't! Yes it's family owned. You'll see the dad and both of his sons working most nights. They care about what you think! They are constantly getting better. If you look at the poor reviews they are from 4+ months ago. They are getting more staff and more options. If you don't see something on the menu just ask! I have honestly loved everything I've ever ordered and so does my wife! Chips and tortillas and made in house and are AMAZING!!! Give it a chance I promise you'll enjoy it! There will probably be a wait so try it when you aren't in a rush."}
{"text":"2nd time to the restaurant. Took my whole family this time. Everyone like it. I had a chimichanga style El Pastor burrito. Comes with.sour cream and guac. They even have me a free taco to try El Pastor to see if I'd like it. Chops and salsa have improved. Perfect heat. Chile relano was tasty also. Will go back again and again."}
{"text":"This was the worst Mexican food I've had in a long time. I too came here based off the reviews and I was very disappointed. 

First off the cook was extremely rude in greeting me. Before I could even place my order he immediately asked me if it was \"to go\". I hadn't even had the chance to look at the menu or place my order. After I placed my order I stood and watched the cook as he was solely preparing orders. One thing that caught my eye was that he was microwaving items as he was putting them on the plates instead of having them warmed on a stove. I could tell at this point that this may be a bad experience. As he was making the tortillas for the street tacos he was dipping them in the grease from the fryer that was used to make French fries and chicken nugget! Gross!! Last thing that made me cringe is he scooped my rice out of a grocery store plastic bag! My blood started to boil and I was so close to telling them to give me my money back but I bit my tongue and kindly took my order and left. I was so hoping that when I got home and actually ate the food that I would feel a different way, so wrong...the food was horrible. I've had better Mexican from a fast food restaurant. Won't ever eat here again."}
{"text":"So good! Friendly and welcoming staff! The food is also straight fire! Amazing flavors and quality. You can tell they truly care about the customer. 
I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for true Mexican food."}
{"text":"Dropped in tonight for quick test I restaurant.  Food is amazing, large portions, and on point.  Margaritas huge for $5..... Loving it!!!!"}
{"text":"Do not be scared by the lack of patrons in this establishment. This is a hidden gem that you do not want to pass up! The guacamole was a wonderful refreshing appetizer with a hint of lime. Get the Elote or maybe a couple as it is very addicting!! The green salsa provided upon sitting down was by far the best of the ones provided."}
{"text":"I enjoy new and first experiences within the world of gastronomy. However, I am not sure we could use that level of excellence in verbiage today. Traditional cuisine seems more appropriate for this soirée of pontificates. Being a food lover, of Mexican decent, and accustomed to great Mexican food. I feel well equipped and informed to disseminate this review to my fellow yelpers.

Upon entry and seating the establishment appeared clean, open, and light. Promptly, we were escorted to our table and given chips, salsa, and bean dip. All which, were par for the course. The bean dip was not extraordinary ... but we could have stomached a second helping. The salsa was interesting. I would rate it as medium heat. However, my wife would rate it as hot. The texture was slightly liquid and had an interesting combination of cilantro and cucumber finish. Refreshing in our current heat wave. 

While ordering, our server Luis, did not know the entire menu (I should add that the menu is delightfully simple). Being that his mother is the head chef/cook I was disappointed. Especially, because this is a family owned and operated restaurant. For our entrees we chose the following. Shredded beef burrito (contained beans and rice), Sope with Carnitas, Gordita with Chile Colorado, Taco de Machaca (hard shell), along with a side of beans and rice. 

Let's start with the burrito. It was a generous portion, well rolled, and wrapped with a home-made tortilla! By the way, the flour tortillas are good. The shredded beef was the same shredded beef in my Taco de \"Machaca.\" The meat within the burrito was uninspiring. However, once we added the house tomatillo sauce the meat was revived.

The Gordita with Chile Colorado came boasting of traditional textures and presentation. Yet once again, the flavor profile quickly followed suite. Please do not misunderstand me...it was not bad...it simply lacked insight. As the Gordita, my Taco de Machaca left me wishing I was in the Corazón of Sonora were the Machaca screams of rich meaty and buttery flavors coupled in freshly sautéed jalapeños, onions, and other such selected vegetables. Not fresh from a crockpot or similar cooking apparatus. 

Finally, the Sope with Carnitas...inspirational! And after adding the house tomatillo...revelatory! Wonderful texture (and I ate this last), flavor was as expected, and serving size was spot on! I will return any day for the Sopes alone. And as a bonus, the rice was fluffy and flavorful!

In summation, Casa Maria is worth visiting to formulate your own opinion. Expect traditional and honest Mexican cuisine. Our visit was pleasant and the owners were on-site and ready to serve their patrons. There are more items I desire to taste from this establishment, such as, Al Pastor (not available on this visit) Chile Verde, Chile Relleno, Enchiladas, and Birra de Chivo (just few that cross my mind). I grew up enjoying Birra de Chivo and am looking forward to exploring this menu in greater depth. Until next time, happy yelping and dinning."}
{"text":"Not sure who's giving this place 5 stars. The food is very average, there was nothing special. We ordered steak nachos that came out cold, enchiladas were decent, and the kids cheese quesadillas were not edible. Their homemade chips are good. The server was a bit creepy. The owner offices at one of the tables and sweats profusely, I'm sure he's a nice guy but maybe sitting at one of the tables isn't the best office option. I noticed the same lady that made out food also clean the floors after, that was also a turn off. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I came specifically because I saw the shrimp tacos. I ended up going with shrimp fajitas. They are delicious."}
{"text":"This place is clean inside and the staff is friendly. Free chips, salsa, and bean dip. The food was pretty clean (not too greasy, no fat in the meat) and it was flavorful. Portion size was average. For the offerings on the menu it's a solid Mexican joint."}
{"text":"Food is extremely good and authentic Mexican. Great prices and the service is also really good. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. It's my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"If i could id give this place 0 stars. Horrible customer service and the food was cold. When i spoke to the manager she gave me a blank stare. Just horrible!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Casa Maria is a local, family owned, restaurant in Chandler.  We typically choose small, local business when we can, and we were thrilled to have chosen this place!

Upon entering, we thought we may be ordering at the counter, but were escorted to a table and offered menus.  Upon being seated, our attention immediately shifted to cleanliness of the entire facility.  While there, we were able to meet Maria, the owner and mother to two sons, Luis (our waiter) and Raul (assisted Luis in delivering our meals).

Our meals included shrimp tacos, mini-chimis, enchiladas and a veggie burrito.  Everyone at our table enjoyed their meals, and left with a full belly.

Price was as expected, service may strike some as overly friendly, but it is exactly why we choose restaurants like this!!

Give local a chance, and plan to enjoy your visit to this new establishment."}

{"text":"Yuck yuck yuck!! This place is terrible and what a waste! First off we asked for a hotter salsa and he brings a steaming bowl of orange vinegary grease! I stupidly tried a bit on my chip and things went downhill from there! Me and my husband both ordered street taco and they were over cooked and greasy! One of my husbands tacos he could hardly stomach! Wishing we walked out after he brought the bowl of dirty grease ugh!!! Had to come home and scrub our mouths out to get the nasty out! Gross!!!"}
{"text":"First walked in , was greeted by a nice gentleman.
