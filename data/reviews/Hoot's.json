{"text":"Hoot's has awesome food in an unexpecting location. Most people that don't already know about Hoot's probably wouldn't expect much, as it is in a diver bar but they have the best steak salad, reuben sandwich, fish sandwich & HOMEMADE fried appetizers in the area. You must give it a try!"}
{"text":"Fish sandwiches and soups are great but still haven't figured out why people like the Reubens so much. A lot of bread and not enough meat. Terrible"}
{"text":"This little dive bar is a treasure.  All I want to say is...OMG on their provolone sticks!!!! The are made to order. They bread their own. Thick and crunchy.  I love their liver and onions. I always pass on their delicious fried fish and go for their baked moist flavorful fish. Size is smaller than fried but deliciously prepared"}
{"text":"This is one of those places you'd never go unless someone told you to.  Tucked in a side entrance off Walnut Street, it's definitely a dive and in an area where you wouldn't expect to find good food.  The food IS good though.  Huge portions and SUPER CHEAP PRICES.   They have a full bar - nothing fancy, but a good selection of standard bar goodies.  Bar prices are also super cheap.  I highly recommend the fish sandwich.  It's crunchy and delicious and a very unexpected treat.  It does have way too much bread though - I end up tossing half the bun and just eating it that way.     Deducted a star because although they have a separate entrance to get into the \"non-smoking\" restaurant side, chances are that you will leave the place smelling like an ashtray.  The smoking bar and non-smoking restaurant are connected and the servers go in between the two a million times a day, so the dividing wall and swinging door are more for show than actual function."}
{"text":"I am always on the lookout for a darn good fish sammich. This really hit the spot for a good sized hunk of cod on a roll It's a tiny place, the kind of bar you wouldn't think of going into unless someone vouched for it first"}
{"text":"I have only ever done the fish sandwiches with family. Really darn good. Quite large so a pretty fair value despite the price. The haluski side often runs out, especially during Lent."}
