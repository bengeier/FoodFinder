{"text":"Awesome food! Love the combo tray. Carne asada...yum!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I grew up in TX on the frontera and this is almost like home. Homemade Tortillas!! They make Gorditas too and they are amazing!! Sopes are great! Tacos are great! And their Michaladas are YUMM!!! Not one of the so called 'Mexican\" restaurants that are really Americanized. This one is truly authentic and worth every penny. I stop here at least once a week. My other half choses Taco Bell (SMH. She is from here so she doesn't know true Mexican food. Bendita... LOL) and I chose Acapulco. Hands down one of my favorite."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was actually VERY good.  The chips and 3 different dips were great, and the food arrived hot and nicely prepared.  However, the service was the worst I've ever had.  There were no English menus, no one really spoke English well, and it took forever just to get drinks.  The waitress was very unattentive, to the point that we had to constantly flag her down to get anything.  It took nearly an hour before our food arrived at our table, which by that time, I really wasn't hungry anymore, and there were only 3 other people in the restaurant at the time, so they were not busy at all.  First and last visit unfortunately."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had at ANY restaurant EVER!  Had to get our own menus, took 10 minutes to get drinks, 30 minutes to get food and another 20 minutes to get check.  The only reason I got check at all was because I stood up in the middle of the restaurant and physically got in front of server to ask for check for third time.  Oh, and my wife got food poisoning there and threw up before leaving the restaurant.  Can't tell you stay away enough."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant we have been to in NC since we moved here from San Diego and we know our Mexican food. The food is authentic. I can' say enough about our waitress Ana. She was so helpful, knowledgeable about the menu, and extremely nice. I have dairy allergies and they were able to modify my meal to make sure I was able to enjoy it. Great service, GREAT MEAL and good prices. This is definitely a place I would come back to again."}
{"text":"They've got some of the best burritos I've ever had, and it's a minor thing, but the drive-thru window is a game changer"}
{"text":"Hands down,  best authentic mexican food around.  We used to live in southern California and had our pick of authentic mexican food."}
{"text":"Authentic! Handmade tortillas and chips yummmm! Everything prepared from
Scratch. My family favorite for 10yrs running. Never anything but the tastiest!"}
{"text":"Loved the food. Good prices and good service, too. Appreciated that the refried beans were home made instead of canned. Good salsa and chimichanga was delicious."}
{"text":"We have been eating at this restaurant for five years or more and we used to truly love it. It was authentic Mexican and the quality was excellent. When we started patronizing them there wasn't even an English menu available. Unfortunately, their quality has gone down over e last four or five visits. Cleanliness is an issue now. E wait staff is less than efficient. 
Tonight was truly sad because it will be our last visit to Acapulco. Even the Hispanic customers are staying away it seems now.
It used to be so good and now it's just sub-par."}
{"text":"I used to love this place I want to say first off. Because of this experience I joined yelp to hopefully help others not to go here. I walk in and they have a recent sanitation score of a 92.  There was a guy I observed cutting fresh meat in the back I could clearly see through the window, he is wearing gloves. I'm like awesome! Fresh meat for my tacos this is going to be great. Nope everything but that... The guy slicing the meat came to the front dug money out of the cash register wearing the same gloves he was cutting meat with. I'm like OK little gross but OK... He was back and continued to cut meat with those same gloves on. That's not the worst part... He went on to wipe his nose and face wearing those same gloves all while cutting this huge piece of meat. The cook was wearing no gloves and the waitress dug my chips out with her hands. I walked out with throw up in my mouth and went to Taco Bell. I would give them a negative number if I could."}
{"text":"Customer service is poor! Each person at my table received their food 5 minutes apart for all 4 of us. Food lacks flavor! They try to charge you extra for things and act surprised when you ask about it. Overall I'll never be back to the place!"}
{"text":"Thursday dollar beer nights...GENUINE Mexican food that provides a novel of a menu.  The portion size is beyond generous (you can't possibly go home hungry).  My fiance had a burrito the size of my forearm.  The salsas and dips given before the meal are filling enough with their homemade tortillas.  If you want the best guacamole, this is the place to get it.  You really can't get better than this."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant in the 90 mile radius. I travel for business both in NC and to Mexico. Sometimes you find a gem in food and this is the place. The place is very basic with a laundry and tatto parlor next to it. When you enter the place is like being in Mexico and the food.
My favorite is the Molcajete , which is carne assada (beef), grill chicken, chorizo,  grill oniion/jalepenos/nopales (cactus) with fresh hand made corn tortillas. It is advertise for two but I have taken four friends and we all were full.
Their fajitas are first rate. Thursday is $2 Mexican bottle beer day. They have an excellent salsa verde with chunks of avocado.
The only item I found to be so so was the michelada. I am use to a michelada that is your favorite beer, lime juice, magi juice, hot sauce and ice. They add tomato juice and I prefer the more traditional mix."}
{"text":"Food was very good! Authentic mexican food done well and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We got take out from here on Saturday night. Tried chicken tacos, steak tacos, chicken burrito & steak burrito and the food was delicious. Food was fast and fresh. Their hot salsa was one of the best I've tasted in a while. We will be going back."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Mexican food that I have eaten since we moved here from San Diego 2 years ago. Their tortillas are made in house. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Probably the best Mexican I've had since moving to NC! Great flavor, nothing was bland! You get two salsas & a cheese dip with chips to start. The green Salsa is amazing. Would buy a bottle of it! 
Best thing is you can get a smaller version of the dinner - lunch size for an upgrade. Still a huge portion! Brought half my food home. Our bill was 20 bucks! For 1 soft drink and 2 huge sized meals. Cheap good food! Wish we lived closer! Definitely don't pass this thinking it's a dive with bad food because it may not be super fancy on the inside but great service and food! Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Mexcellent! While on a recent road trip, Yelp reviews led me to Acapulco Restaurant, and I was not let down. My lunch started with chips and two salsas, red and green, and the green salsa is friggin' awesome! I ate chips with this green heat before, during, and after my meal! I ordered the chile relleno which was also incredible. The corn tortillas were fresh and fantastic. While I had a beer with lunch, I noticed that they were serving authentic aguas frescas to the regulars here, so i got a tamarind one for the road. It was great as well. The food here is legit, and definitely the best stop for Mexican if driving through the area."}
{"text":"The shrimp and rice is pretty good. Just hope there could be more shrimps! Next time, I will ask them to put the cheese on the side, a little bit too much for me.

Food was three or four stars, but there is something wrong with the way they charge. When I check my accounts days later, they charge more than I give. Although it is not even a dollar, but this is really dishonest and disgusting."}
{"text":"People have raved about this place I would not give it five stars the food was good but very greasy. We had the Mexicali platter which was enough food to feed and army however the meat was overlooked and dry.  The charro beans were excellent and the catacus was prepared perfectly.   If you can get through the grease then the Restuant is worth one more chance."}
