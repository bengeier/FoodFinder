{"text":"Went there to watch a World Series game on a Tuesday night. Sat at the bar. Bartenders were very attentive and the food was pretty good. Prices were excellent. Will go back."}
{"text":"Hands down, this was the worst dining experience ever. First of all, it took them 30 minutes to get us our drinks and another 45 minutes to get our food. In the end they forgot my water, my daughters salad, and never asked us if we wanted refills on our drinks. The worst thing about it was that the place was empty. I expected bettet service. I will never eat there again and make sure I voice how terrible my experience was with anyone who will listen."}
{"text":"The mixed reviews here on yelp made me avoid this place for a long time but now I regret that decision. The staff was really cool and inviting, the food was great, and the other patrons were friendly. My advice to new customers: try this place out if you haven't, the negative reviews can be misleading."}
{"text":"The staff and the food is awesome. Very clean and friendly. Can't beat the happy hour prices"}
{"text":"I just had a quick lunch and one of the BEST burgers! The double special was fabulous. Friendly, fast service and great flavor. Will definitely be returning to JJ's Grill!"}
{"text":"We really liked JJs.  Owner greeted us and asked what game we wanted to watch.  Service was fast and friendly.  Burgers and wings were great."}
{"text":"We got there around 10:20 PM, hungry and thirsty after Monday night football game. The kitchen was closed, and the burgers and fries looked and smelled wonderful. But the Makers Mark was rightous so all was not lost. JJs shares the parking lot with In and Out, management said OK. Service was good and friendly."}
{"text":"Perfect place to relax, great food, excellent atmosphere and music, Nevaeh is one of the best staff that I know. I usually come during the week days to enjoy the night"}
{"text":"Great spot to chill drink a couple and dance to some good music!! Dj og Danny boy kills it every Friday and Saturday!! Drink up and have a great time!! #intoxicated softball team spot!!"}
{"text":"The new owners are awesome. Great pool tables.  These tables are top of the line pool tables. The Tuesday tacos are great."}
{"text":"Made my first and last visit to this dive, for one simple reason; the owner/bartender.  The staff was pleasant and attentive. I was enjoying myself until the owner started running his mouth and being rude. Not a very good way to treat a first time customer. I may have returned and invited some of my friends to join me.  But after my experience with the owner, I feel he's insecure with himself and takes it out on selected customers who are there to unwind after a hard days work.  Customer beware.  You may be the next victim of his bad moods and attitude."}
{"text":"JJs buffalo shrimp is amazing. The wing sause is. Very good. Happy hour on Saturdays.  it's a good sports bar."}
{"text":"My husband and I sat in the bar at a booth.  Lots of good seating. We were greated by Anthony who was wonderful.   He told us new munue.    Happy hour 1/2 price appetizers.   We got the buffalo shrimp.  You can get hot or mild sauce.  We could not decide so Anthony suggested we get both sauces which we did.  Excellent appetizer.  For entree I got the Lei'd burger.  Sooo goood.  My husband had B.A.S. burger.  His was excellent too.  Anthony was so attentive and hes not even a server.   Lots of TVs, mix of good music in background.  I suggest this place you wont be diappointed."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place so went with family. The food looked good from reading the menu was seated and got our sodas fast. Ordered appetizer and our food and a small water for the baby. 40 minutes went by nothing no water no food no checking up on us people near us got food before us. Just a disappointment. The sodas were even flat but we still dealt with it in the end we Ended up leaving."}
{"text":"Really inexpensive and good food. The portions are good sizes too. Also, good place to hang out and watch games or fights. I'm not a drinker, but my hubby likes the drink prices here. Last, it has pool tables so there are lots of options to have a good time."}
{"text":"When we travel we always love going in some random bar. Wow!! This place a a gem!!! Everyone from the employees to customers were amazing.  Great Happy Hour!! Please give them a try! We are visiting from  California and Washington state!"}
{"text":"I always have a great time when I come in! Kim and James always take such good care of me! It's hard to come by some good hospitality these days, but I know when I come here I know I'll get great service and great quality of food!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff good food and not a bad seat in the house for special events!!!! I like coming here to relax and enjoy some good draft beer they have a great selection  at reasonable  prices....."}
{"text":"I haven't visited JJ's other than for breakfast so far. What caught my eye was the Free breakfast with purchase of a drink. A Bloody Mary went great with the breakfast of 2 eggs,Bacon, hash browns and a slice of toast. Not a big breakfast but still well worth the price. Other breakfasts I've tried were the Chorizo and eggs, Chicken Fried Chicken, but my favorite are the pancakes they are huge and put Denny's and Ihop to shame. Chrissy and Virginia are the servers on the mornings I've gone and are friendly."}
{"text":"Been here about a dozen times weekdays between 3pm-9pm. Everytime A+ experience.  2 coin operated billiards in good condition. 3 awesome modern soft tip dart boards. Poker tournaments. Random playlist from hip\hop, country, r&b, a bit of Spanish this spot plays to everyone's beat. TV's everywhere not a bad seat in the house. Great cold draft selection Kilt Lifter , dechutes, Sculpin, and all your generic beers. crazy enough even the micheladas are very well prepared .  Burger special hits the spot and they arent stingy on the thin crisp fries. Chilli cheese fries are big, chicken strips crispy on the outside and juicy white meat. Best of all everything is clean from bar, high tops, booths , down to the restroom."}
{"text":"Stop in on sunday evening sometimes the bartender is awesome. Shes fast and friendly. (And nice to look at) the owner is there and ready to help out. This is a great place."}
{"text":"Yes!! Finally found some awesome wings on this side of town!! The ambiance does leave something to be desired though. The dining area was kinda quite so we sat next to the bar. Food came out fresh. We went during happy hour when the appetizers are half off."}
{"text":"The food is awesome! Burgers are cooked to order and are tasty. Nachos are mixed with tender chicken and beef ....mmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Since new ownership the place is making many new improvements! Pool tables & corn hole have been added! The food is always on point and there are many options to choose from. I also like the selection of local craft beers they have added on draft."}
{"text":"Nice clean Friendly Bar. Great service and plenty of big screens around. Food specials are awesome and greatly enjoyed our first meals."}
{"text":"A fun place for good food and games  JJs Grill is a fun place to meet with friends/family and enjoy good food. JJ's Grill has a variety of billiards, dart boards, poool tables, TV's,  and games to keep everyone entertained.  On this visit my friends and I shared Fried zucchini and ranch dressing, honey barbecue wings, fish and chips basket, and a club sandwich.  All our entrees were  fresh and seasoned just right. The price was also great, the staff was friendly and the place was very clean!  I cant wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Torn between 2 and 4 stars. Four for the food and 2 for the restaurant.  We ordered the double cheeseburger for $6.99 and it was very good. The burger came with a side of hot and crispy fries. Our lunch for tomorrow, half of the cheeseburger, rests in a take home container.  I hate to give two stars for the restaurant but the matter of fact is it poorly managed. \"Take a seat anywhere\" landed us at the only clean high top where the lights were turned off. The staff consisted of one bartender and one waitress. After 10 minutes the manager noticed no one had been to our table. He handed us menus and walked away. No offer to get our drinks. So again we waited for the waitress.  By now you are probably wondering why we stayed. Answer - six tv screens and a Titans football game.  It didn't take long to get our food. It did take long to get refills, then a take home container, and then our bill.   None of this would have happened if the manager would have helped the staff. Watching the football game should never come before your customers. BTW - a good manager would not occupy the one high top table that had lights turned on.  Not sure if we will make it back.  Our tab with one soda, tax, and tip was $20."}
{"text":"Great place for a burger,wings and a beer!  A neighborhood gem!   A place I will return to. With that said, I have visited the 2 preceding establishments that occupied this location over the years (Antar's and the Gym). And I PREFER JJ's Grill atmosphere much much better.  The Buffalo Shrimp is amazing. The Fish and Chips is REAL fish, not frozen fabricated identical pieces plus, I was allowed to sub a side salad for the fries at no additional charge which is HUGE for me. The tartar sauce is HOMEMADE and the salad didn't come out of a bag.  The best part about our visit last night was....we WERE NOT GOUGED on our drafts!! So many places are charging upwards of 7 bucks for a 16 oz draft. Those are the places, I cease to visit."}
{"text":"Lots of room, sports bar atmosphere.  Good choice of beers, including craft on tap.  New waitress struggled, bartender and manager were friendly and greeted us as we came in.  Food was very slow coming out, adequate but nothing to get excited about.  An ok experience overall, but would return only for the beer and to watch a game on TV."}
{"text":"Food was really, really good!  We had nachos (BOMB), the fish fry was really good (nice batter, wasn't heavy and greasy), the chicken strips were also good (batter also good, chicken was yummy), and the tots were great!  Service was lacking.  They only had one server and one cook, maybe because it was the day after thanksgiving and didn't think they'd be busy?  Overall, though really good!  Would totally go back!"}
{"text":"Iceeeee coldddd beeerrrr !!! The glassses were frozen .. the best way to drink a beer , reaper wings were awesome ,, like the flavor , they were literally out of the fryer ... that's what I was looking for a Sunday evening ... be back often for the same thing , bartender had an attitude but it's fine she's does a good job"}
{"text":"Music was great! Real laid back atmosphere, fantastic service. This place you can come, relax with friends or family in a comfortable relaxing environment with great food at a great price. The place I want to return to over and over again!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this place Saturday, March 18, 2017. We were in town for the NASCAR race. Picked the place because it had dart boards and pool tables and it has the same initials as my favorite NASCAR Driver, Jimmie Johnson 7 time cup Champion. When we got there we were greeted by two security personnel one guy pats you down and the other checks your ID. After we were done getting checked, the guy asks me to not turn my ball cap around. Well this lead me to believe that there must be some type of gang activity in the area and that they must have fights frequently. Nonetheless we continued to inside. For the size of the bar it was dead and on a Saturday night. Well at least we would get good Service at the bar. Not really, only one bartender working and no waitress. It took me about 5 minutes to get two draft beers. The bar and surrounding area was nice the carpet was pretty dirty and in need of steam cleaning. It was a bit warm inside the a.c. was not on and they only had ceiling fans on. We just went there to play pool and shoot darts and have a few beers. I thought that we might sample some food but the kitchen was closed. They had a live DJ and he was playing good music and catering to the crowd. All in all a so so place. Probably wouldn't go there again though."}
{"text":"Very clean! Kim is really friendly (bartender). They have poker, pool tables, darts, golf machine.  Always playing a variety of music, from rock, country, Banda, hip hop, etc... It's really good.   Happy hour consists of half off appetizers and some discounts on beers.  They have all day happy hour Tuesday and Wednesday. They have happy hour every day as well.  Every day they have $6 small pitcher of margaritas and they have a double cheeseburger special.   I really like their chili cheese fries, I have tried their double cheeseburger which I really liked as well. Their nachos are alright and their wings as well. They have lots of sauces and most are JJ custom.   This is an amazing neighborhood bar, never had one like this before!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for happy hour on a weekday afternoon. Ten minutes after we sat down, the bartender staggered over and took our drink order.   What is a Manhattan? Ok, its all good. Lets try a hurricane. Bartender seemed bewildered , as if surrounded by stinging bees. How about a draft beer?  After more delays, we finally received our drink orders.    Service was slow, incredibly slow.  Basically a sports bar motif with numerous TV monitors throughout the bar. Atmosphere was less than cordial. Not a friendly place for a quiet drink.  The other customers  seemed beaten down by a combination of bad service and the  lackadaisical attitude of the staff."}
{"text":"Great place. Food is great, happy hour is excellent and until 7pm. The new staff is on point. New owners really bringing things together and  bringing out the potential in the bar and location. Crowd is friendly, no drama. Music is excellent (classic rock, blues, etc.) during the week and DJ playing club music on the weekend nights. My new spot for a long time"}
{"text":"Great local spot with AMAZING happy hour prices! Enjoyed a few pints of Stones limited release beer for $3 during their  happy hour (which is 7 days a week)! Anthony was great with recommendations from the menu. A lot of different sauces and dry rub options for wings. Burgers are of good quality and good atmosphere. Will definitely be coming back! Thanks for a good place to wind down on Sunday fun day."}
{"text":"Came in to have bfast & Bloody Mary but no one was working in bar! I sat at bar for 10 min then left for Village Inn. Not sure how this bar is going to make it if u have no employees to serve customers."}
{"text":"Service was non-existent.  We sat at a dirty bar and waited, and waited...until it was clear that it probably wasn't the place we wanted to eat.  Luckily there was a nearby Island's restaraunt that was fast, friendly and ready to serve customers coming in the door."}
{"text":"The food is good and the staff is good, except the owner!! The owner is non appreciative and disrespectful to his customers, too busy drinking and flirting.... disappointing. I wanted to make this my neighborhood but I'll keep looking."}
{"text":"Excuse my language but they have fucking HORRIBLE service. Sat at a booth for about 10 minutes. The stupid waiters made eye contact and NEVER came to ask if we needed a menu or anything. This is very upsetting since we even considered this horrible place to begin with. One star is ONLY because there's no other option, fuckers."}
{"text":"$4.50 wings everyday except Sundays during happy hour. $2 domestic beers.  Real value"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to bring the family the staff is always friendly, the food is always amazing and the building is always clean my kids love this place and I'm always telling everybody else about it."}
{"text":"Food lacked flavor & was greasy, so I'm giving it 2 stars, it's a new restaurant that definitely has potential & a great location.   Just needs work.  Another down fall for me was how dark it is. The lights are too dim; I mean who likes eating in the dark? Not me.."}
