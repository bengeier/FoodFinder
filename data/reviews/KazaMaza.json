{"text":"Tried Kaza Maza for the first time last night, and it was DELICIOUS. I wish I could eat here every night. I had the dolma and fattet makdous (without meat) and it was fantastic. The fattet makdous was so filling, I brought most of it home and just finished it now and honestly I miss it already. :("}
{"text":"Not as good as i expected, the humis qawrma is not that good, its a bit noisy , there was a man playing oud which was great but u cant hear him over the noise."}
{"text":"Went to KazaMaza for our wedding anniversary.  I Ioved that there were lots of vegetarian choices.  Could have made my entire meal with the starters (in fact, the veggie choices were all in the starters).  I chose an additional starter as my main dish.  The hummus was especially good.  Was looking forward to baklava for dessert but they were out of it.  Tried a \"pudding\" instead.  It was a kind of semoule - new to me and very good.  The waiter was a busy guy but humored us in our several requests.  We had only one complaint, which is that the pita was cold and rubbery.  I usually love pita but I did not even eat this one after the first bite.  Bottom line:  I will be back."}
{"text":"I came here two years ago with the fam and it has been *The* restaurant that's left us salivating for more. This time, we came for the brunch offered on weekends. Brunch comes with pita, pickles, coffee/juice, and a different menu- although normal menu is available too. The standout dishes were the baba ghanoush and fattouch salad. The bg came garnished with pomegranate seeds and parsley- it was vibrant and chunky. The roasted eggplant flavor beamed through in each bite. The fattouch salad was perfectly dressed. I particularly liked the scallions and thinly sliced radishes in the mix. 

We ordered two lamb dishes- my mom can't not have lamb when it is available- the brunch kawarma and one of the specialty keftas, the grenadine one. The kawarma was a ground lamb baked under eggs. The kefta was a little bit tougher than I remember it being the last time. Biggest complaint is that the entrees don't come with rice so we ordered it separately. Nevertheless, there was free flowing pita to sop up the sauce.

And for non-French speakers, they offer an English menu!"}
{"text":"Great small dishes, served beautifully and very tasty. The carpaccio, hummus and fattoush salad were my favorites. The waiter could've been a little more knowledgable about wines and the dishes he served. Not too too pricy."}
{"text":"Cadre agréable du restaurant aménagé dans un ancien rez-de-chaussée d'une maison particulière. La cuisine est bonne avec un bon choix de mezze.
Accueil d'une grande gentillesse et service simple et discret"}
{"text":"Delicious Lebanese food in a cool and cozy setting. The grilled octopus is fantastic."}
{"text":"Has to the be one of the best Middle Eastern food in Canada I have ever tried. In a fresh concept restaurant design, the arabic dishes were extremely good and well worth it. We had asked to keep the dishes coming one after another as soon as we were done one, which was done! Variety of food was fairly good, as those meals are not easy ones to cook. Waitress was exceptional as was the rest of the beautiful young ladies staff! If you are in Montreal and know your food, I have to recommend that you go to this place. I was there on Feb 14th, 2014 on a cold winter night!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience. Good waiters. Most of the food very nice. One of our dishes not so great."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Visiting from Toronto and that's the best middle.eastren food I had so far"}
{"text":"I love this place. The crew and mood is not Lebanese. 
In a way you miss out because Lebanese tend to have this hospitable joyful nature in them, and they serve food with passion rather than a sense of duty. 
And in a way that's good and keeps the vibe more international-friendly and at decent volume- because the place is small for loud Lebanese laughing crowd :)

Basically, it's the place to have great Lebanese food but not the total Lebanese experience, which worked very well for me and my friends.

Everyone was mega impressed by the food. We had the Masaya wine, and enjoyed the taste of the Lebanese grapes."}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful. 

The Chef offers a  great twist on lebanese/syrian cuisine. The ambiance is laid back.

We had a great time."}
{"text":"Savoureux! Les plats sont excellents, service charmant et attentionné qui nous fait oublier le niveau sonnore un peu élevé lorsque la salle est pleine."}
{"text":"Delicious, belly-warming, perfectly-spiced food in a cozy atmosphere. Friendly service, reasonable prices. I will definitely be back!

The details: We decided to go here on a whim on a Wednesday night. The restaurant is in what feels like a formerly residential space, which gives it a cozy/quaint vibe. There were a decent amount of people, but there was enough space for us to get a table. (There is a small bar area that I would have eaten at had there been no tables.) Right after we sat down, a server came by with water, a bowl of olives and peppers, and a candle. Just the right amount of cozy. Service was thorough and paced just perfectly so that we still had some of our remaining appetizer hummus by the time our main dishes arrived. Warm pita bread would have been amazing, but the room temperature pita was fine. We ordered the fattet makdous, which the waiter had said was delicious. And, holy moly, it was AMAZING. Layers of lamb, eggplant, and pita chips (who knew?!) with tahini and tomato sauce. Eat mouthfuls with a spoon, smear it onto pita bread, or stick it with a fork--any way you eat it, it's so good. We also got the kibbé labniyé, which are falafel-like balls stuffed with beef in a yummy tahini and yogurt sauce. We didn't order dessert because we were full to contentment. It was a great meal, and I will be back, especially in the winter for their stick-to-your-ribs dishes ."}
{"text":"This is the best Middle Eastern food we have ever eaten.  Order the Mutabbal betteraves, I have never had this before, but will now try to recreate this at home and eat with everything!  It is a beet-tahini-yogurt spread the consistency of hummus.  You can eat this with a pita, but I preferred to mix this with the rest of our food.  Get the house salad, it has the perfect amount of salt, spices citrus and a hint of mint.  Order any kefta or main platter that comes out hot, we had the Kefta avec aubergines cooked in a tomato base with red and green peppers....this place is just amazing.

You can walk in, but I would recommend calling in to make a reservation if you are eating during peak dinner hours.  We walked in at 5 or 6p before the dinner rush, and only two tables were not reserved."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place. Most options contain beef or shrimp which originally made me a little skeptical, because id say i am definitely one of those people who like sharing different dishes with the people I'm with, but all dishes can be served as a vegetarian option. Our waiter was extremely helpful and described the food extremely well and helped us make a decision based of of my little knowledge to middle eastern cuisine. But honestly, i  could've chosen anything off of that menu and have it be delicious. Definitely try the home made hummus and babagounoush which is out of this world. This place is a charming spot for a date or even a large party, for the space is well laid out and extremely quaint. Definitely worth a visit down du Parc. Oh yeah and cant beat the pita bread and olives tat compliment any dish you try!"}
{"text":"Amazing Syrian / Lebanese food. ...everything was so delicious and portions were generous. The Kafta in cherry sauce was out of this world...highly recommended restaurant."}
{"text":"Belle adresse à retenir.  L'agneau était succulent et très savoureux, tout en nuances.  J'ai adoré la purée de betteraves disponibles dans les mezzés.  Si vous aimez la découverte des arômes, des ingrédients, des épices, vous serez au bon endroit.  J'ai beaucoup apprécié l'ambiance décontractée.  Le vin libanais qui accompagnait nos plats était dans le ton; excellente recommandation de notre serveur.  En définitive, une table à retenir surtout pour les saisons fraîches/froides où la nourriture apporte chaleur et réconfort."}
{"text":"Ate another fantastic meal here.
We are here last year & this year. Both amazing meals.
This time we had a nice assortment of lamb dishes, a glass of wine, a salad, and a lentil dish. We are for three & it was fantastic.
Service is bi-lingual - as are the new menus. 

Go when they have live music if you can. Otherwise, just go and enjoy! It gets busier later in the evening. 
I would get a reservation after 7p."}
{"text":"High prices, small portions and very very bland. There are many authentic proper Lebanese restaurants in this city so need to waste a meal here."}
{"text":"A friend and I came here today, as we were craving Syrian food. Damas (a few blocks away) is another Syrian place that he had been to before but it is only open for dinner so we decided to try something new.

Food - the menu has quite a good selection of appetizers and entrees. We decided to start with a fattoush (Mediterranean salad with toasted pita chips) and a kibbe nayyeh which is essentially a Lebanese/Syrian version of beef tartare. The portions were both quite large considering we got the smaller versions of both appetizers. The salad was delicious (probably the peak of our meal) and the kibbe was alright. It lacked depth and complexity of flavor - probably needed to sit a bit longer with spices. For the mains, I am a big fan of kefta (lamb) and tart/sweet fruit sauces so I got the one that was cooked in a sour cherry sauce. There was also a pomegranate tahini sauce. It was very good. The meat was tender and it was paired perfectly with the side of rice that accompanied it. The flavours could have been a bit more complex and it felt like nutmeg overpowered the meat a bit, but overall it was very good. My friend got the braised lamb shank with friki (wheat) and while the meat was well cooked and tender, it was completely devoid of flavour. It had no seasoning or herbs and even the yogurt dipping sauce that came with it didn't help much. For being what seemed to be a special of the restaurant, it was quite disappointing. 

Service/Ambiance - We came in on a Sunday early afternoon and the restaurant was pretty much empty - there was only a family having lunch so we were seated quite promptly. The service was below average to average. Basically it seemed like he just really didn't care. He did answer our questions about the menu but that was the extent of our interaction. No one came by to check how things were tasting and it was a bit slow at the end to pay. The restaurant is pretty bare bones. It's a pleasant atmosphere but nothing extraordinary. It is a good casual place to grab food. It is a decent size so probably good for groups.

Overall, we were left full and relatively satisfied with our meals. From what I have heard, Damas would have been a much better option, albeit at a higher price point. I don't think I would come back here but it was not an unpleasant experience. It is just that for what we paid, we could have had something much better elsewhere, considering the extensive choice of food from this area in Montreal."}
{"text":"I thought the service was great. Our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful. I thought the appetizers were pretty plain, with the exception of the keftas (which look like quesadillas). Otherwise, we got the baba, fattoush and filet mignon slices, which were not super flavorful. If the place weren't so expensive, it wouldn't be so bad. Oh yea, we did get one entree, the octopus. Again, it was solid but not exceptional. Probably will not go back."}
{"text":"Their menu seems to have changed from 2 years ago when we were first there, when it seemed like magic. Perhaps it is just my husband's and my memory, but it does not suit us any more. I am vegetarian and there were vegetarian options on the menu besides the salads. Now you have to request that certain marked main dishes be made so. There seemed to be fewer options than before, when there was more of a \"small plates\" vibe. I'm not marking this less than a three because what we had there last night had pretty good taste, but we will now be seeking a Middle Eastern fix elsewhere."}
{"text":"I see a lot of good comments here, so I'll put our experience as a one off, but it truly was horrible - probably the only time in the 7 years I've been in Montreal that I've wanted to walk out of a restaurant. The service was terrible, slow, inconsiderate and whatever other uncomplimentary adjective you can think of. It was pretty humiliating in parts with the person who looked the owner fawning over a bigger table, while our waiter seemed the most disinterested creature on the fact of the earth. It took over half hour for one of the dishes we ordered to get to us - and no apologies, no updates, we were left waiting in one corner of the room. The food was painfully average - one of the dishes was fine (the moutaqa i think) but apart from that the baba ganouj was pretty average, and the kibbe were too salty. So all in all, I felt like I wasted a good deal of my money, and couldn't even leave with the satisfaction that I was treated well by the staff. Horrible, won't be going back again!"}
{"text":"Very good. Tastiest fattouch in a long while. Super Nice service. Lamb was great. Ground veal was a bit on the overcooked side. Very cold basement for washrooms."}
{"text":"A friend and I where looking for a place to eat on park,
(being new to the neighborhood i didnt really know what was around)
And we discovered KazaMaza(pretty sure its new)  wonderful little mezes and appetizers (think tapas-bar) that are just big enough so that between two people three of them is a nice meal.
The food is middle eastern in flavour but the ambiance is modern casual with lots of great little handmade accents(check out the lighting!)
and great photo's of the owners renovating the space.
so, the food:
we tried the Mousaqa'a, the Hummus Kawarma and the Kefta au Pistaches.
The mousaqa'a was my favorite, a rich chunky sauce of aubergines roasted tomatoes peppers onions and spices, topped with a little bit of yogurt(i dont know what else is in it but its sooo delicous)
My friend who is allergic to tomatoes loved the hummus kawarma best, 
which is a traditional hummus topped with a lamb confit and pine nuts. 
we both agreed that it was probably the best hummus that we'd ever encountered!
the kefta au pistaches was really good too, 
they were little meatballs stuffed with beef, pistachios and deliciousness 
and all of the above is served with plenty of sliced pita and really laid back gracious service. They also mentioned that there's often live music there! so needless to say we'll be back."}
{"text":"Loved it!!!

This place is different from your standard lebanese restaurant in that the chef emphasized the taste of the many mezzeh dishes with added spices and interesting dressing..

best baba ghannoug i ever tasted, there was not a single miss through the whole meal.

definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Lamb shank with friki and kefta with tahini (sesame paste) and pomegranate. Without trying them out, how would you guys know what it taste like?! We would just like to describe them simply: lamb was fork-tender and friki had good amount of spices which gave great flavors; and kefta had toasted pistachios & walnuts in the meatball with its shockingly delicious rich sauce. Fell in love with Syrian cuisine already..!

The service was very good. We loved the waitress who talked like a good friend taking care of/sharing many things in life. One thing though, the restaurant got very busy after 9 pm and there was only one waitress, it was a bit too long to wait for the check. But anything was fine. We were truly pleased with the food and service by the time we were about to leave.

Anyone out there who hasn't tried Syrian food! Please take a visit to Kaza Maza!"}
{"text":"Dropped in Saturday night with party of 4 and got a table. Reservation is probably recommended, as it was very busy. They did fit us in. Received food menus but had to ask for wine menu. Munchies while waiting included a plate of spicy olives and pickled chili, yum.  The White House wine  was very dry and delicious. Remember to ask for ice if you like cold water.

We picked 4 different dishes, 3 delivered at the same time and the 4th some 15 min afterwards, though...delivered with apologies. 

The food was absolutely delicious. Lamb shanks falling apart when prodded, loaded with flavor. Shrimp in tomato/wine sauce. Burst of cardamom, cumin and garlic flavors. Do get an extra order of Naan so you can  dip and scoop up the good stuff. 

If you are on a budget, try the lentil soup with pita bread. The vegetarian in our group raved about it."}
{"text":"Came here with family while visiting Montreal.  Ambience is very nice and raised expectations.  Waited for an hour for our order to brought out(party of 6); 1 persons dish brought out 20mins prior to anyone elses; once everyone elses food was brought I was told my Salmon was forgotten and would talk another 10mins; server offered any appetizer free of charge.
Food was very simple and basic; grilled chicken dish was dry and burned, veggie entrie was okay; minus the lamb was still charged same amount.
No one was thrilled about the food; Kefta Kebabs are good.
I would not recommend this place as their are many other great Mediterranean options in Montreal which are alot better."}
{"text":"Spent five days in Montreal, the great food city, and this is the only place were my girlfriend and I ate. 
The service was very friendly and we got a good local tips for our trip.

Food wise, it was one of the most flavorful and vibrant meals I've had in a while.

Fattouche salad was fantastic... A pomegranate vinaigrette made it sing. Fatter Makdous is a layered eggplant, ground lamb, yogurt and crispy pita dish and taste even better than it sounds. But the real star of the show is the Mutabbal Betteraves. A Mediterranean beet dip that reminds you of hummus... But I really can't do justice with words. It's a must have dish. Mix it with the labneh and spread it on pita for a can't miss combination. In case you missed it... Get the beets!"}
{"text":"Feel like going out without a fuss? Go to Kazamaza and get delicious food in a low-key atmosphere. It's delicious, the price-quality is amazing, and the space is comfy. You'll have to reserve on popular nights - in this case, good things do come in small packages.

A live band playing jazz ensured a perfectly relaxed vibe on this Wednesday night. As did house wine offered in carafes. Bottles of wine are available too, but hey, if we're doing \"chill,\" let's do it all the way, n'est-ce pas?

We started with lentil soup ($4/7) and hummus ($7). Both were unbelievably flavourful. The soup was fresh and not overcooked like many other lentil soups I've tried.  Instead, you could really taste the lentils, tomatoes, coriander, ginger, and bit of lemon and coconut. The hummus was delectably silken, and the chickpeas added a nice contrasting texture.

Next came the spiced grilled chicken with garlic, lemon and Alep pepper and potatoes ($15), and the kefta kebab simmered in sour cherries and pines nuts ($19). So incredibly satisfying!

These plates really confirmed what I love most about Middle Eastern cuisine - it uses simple, everyday ingredients to whip up dishes that are outstanding and bursting with flavour.

And finally, you can't go Middle Eastern without having a taste of the sweet stuff. For dessert, we had the baklava. I wish it had had a little bit more rose water and honey \"coulis\", but nevertheless, it was tasty. 

Kazamaza - Middle Eastern cuisine as you've never tasted it in Montreal.

{"text":"The food was good but not authentic lebanese or middle eastern, it was missing flavour. We had a mezze style (fatoush, hummus, Kebbeh balls, Kafta, ShishTaouk, rice and potatoes) The ambiance was good, the place is small & cozy, we had a good time!"}
{"text":"I ate there several times. I like the food, and ambiance.  The interior is really cozy. However, service is not always good ( you could experience waiting in busy days) . The prices are a bit high but it is fair for the good quality which they provide."}
{"text":"Vraiment tres bien. On y est allé 2 fois déjà et j'y retournerai bientôt. C'est une version du Damas moins chère et un peu moins raffinée évidement mais le rapport qualité pris est exceptionnel! Essayez les rouleaux de fromages, kaftas, humus avec viandes. La salade avec pommes grenades est bonne mais ce n'est pas mon plat préféré. Ils ont une petite terrasse dehors l'été et le vin est abordable. Une belle petite adresse à connaître."}
{"text":"Really good food. Unique taste. Fattoush and the eggplant/yogurt dish was delicious. Lamb shank was a bit dry. Will definitely go back though to try other dishes"}
{"text":"We eat a lot of Middle Eastern food and this resto wins the award for being the best in Montreal in our estimation. Everything was outstanding, with good sized portions. Omar, the chef, who was not cooking that evening, gave us honest recommendations which were very accurate and he was a very friendly, nice guy! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant I tried on my first trip to Montreal. 
The staff members were so helpful and what they suggested was absolute divine. We were the first couple in the restaurant so we got a choice of seats. We were given warm pita bread and olives immediately which was what we needed on the very cold day we arrived in Montreal. 

We asked our waiter what he suggested since we'd just arrived and was in search for something warm and filling. Our waiter suggested we try a dish called Fattet Mawzat. The Fattet Mawzat is a warm dish containing lamb, eggplant, pine nuts, tomato sauce, and mind blowing spices. I don't know what it is but I love pine nuts in my food. They are just so flavorful. We tried the Labneh and the grilled chicken.The grilled chicken was very juicy and grilled. 
 
The setting was very romantic (low lights and candles). It was the perfect way to welcome us to Montreal. I expected to eat only French cuisine while on my mini vacation but I would have 
never thought my first meal in this French city would be Middle Eastern and I loved every bite.

Oh and we also tried some amazing beer named Boréale Rousse. Oh my goodness. This beer was red (yes I said the beer was red -- and no it's not like when we drink green beer for St. Patty's Day). This beer was mind blowing because of the caramel taste! This beer actually paired well with the warm dishes. I will also add that the food was not spicy. Many people think  
middle eastern food tends to be spicy. The dishes we tried were not at all. 
I will definitely return here if we go back to Montreal."}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant, friendly service, and good taste as well. 

Me and my friend shared both our dishes (they gave plates to share). We had lamb shanks with rice and yoghurt (~$22) and kofta with sour cherry sauce (~20). The portions were huge! We were more than done midway. I loved the kofta, beautiful flavours in the cherry sauce and the meat was tendered to perfection. The kofta was served with smoked wheat pita which has the texture of crispy nachos, really compliments the meal. The dish also comes with a side of rice. The lamb shanks was also good but the yoghurt was overwhelming for me and after couple of bites, I didn't feel like having more. If you're not big about the taste of Greek yoghurt, or sour yoghurt or just milk in genera, I'd strongly advice against choosing this dish. I liked the flavour of anar (pomegranate) in the dish and wish there was more of that. 

We also ordered desert (halwa) and I didn't like it that much. I just want to say though that I didn't like it simply because of my personal taste. The dessert was extremely sweet and chewy, glazed with more gooey sweet syrup. I didn't finish it because the entire concept of this dessert was a bit off for me. You might like it if you like the taste and texture of bubble gum.

I'm giving the place 3 stars because I feel this is a promising place but my ordering might not have worked in my favour but I am definitely coming back here to give this restaurant another shot!"}
{"text":"Really, really yummy.  The fattouch salad was one of the best I've ever had.  Muhammara was a little chunkier than I prefer it, but still quite flavorful.  All in all, a really delicious meal and a great place."}
{"text":"This is a perfect place to get together with some friends. The food is good but not breathtaking, a pitcher of beer is $16.00 and half a pitcher $11.00.  I had a Kafta with a very tasty cherry sauce. The service was really good, and the restaurant is pretty well located in Av. du Parc within Plateau."}
{"text":"I've gone twice and I'll go again. The variety of lamb shanks is great and super tasty (especially the one with eggplant), the kafta was really great too. Only thing is they put way too much onions on everything, so if you don't love them, warn the servers! The fattoush salad is perfect. The place gets busy and very noisy, so if you have sensitive ears it might not be the best place for you."}
{"text":"I really like the food. I mean everything is amazing and reasonably priced but the service is pathetic. Expect delays in food. If there is a big crowd out there then dont expect to even get noticed. Everyone will be serving that crowd and your order will either get lost in the middle or get mixed up."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for what you get, noisy as hell, inconsiderate and spotty service. I truly don't understand the appeal. The food is good, but other than that... Would definitely not recommend."}
{"text":"Montreal, you are so lucky to have this restaurant. Great sit down Lebanese/Syrian restaurants that go beyond shawarma are hard to find. 

Everything I had was fantastic. And believe me, I sampled a large portion of the menu. 

Fattoush - beyond words. This is an incredibly flavorful dish that will leave you wondering how a salad upstaged the rest of your meal. Not to be missed.
Baba Ganoush - Smokey eggplant dip topped with sweet and sour pomegranate seeds. So many great flavor a married together. 
Mouhamara - red pepper, walnuts, breadcrumbs ground together into a delicious dip 
Moussa'qa - eggplant and peppers stewed together in a tomato sauce and served cold topped with lebnah- a thick sour cream that is hard to stop eating 
Fried Kibbeh - crispy fried bulgur wrapped around ground meat and nuts
Kefta in pomegranate tahini sauce - served over rice, the sauce is to die for 

Service was friendly and attentive as well. The atmosphere is non pretentious but still a nicer restaurant, perfect for a date or meeting up with a group of friends (lots of dishes meant to be shared with a group). By 9 pm on a Saturday it was full save for one or two tables plus people waiting. 

Seriously, if you are curious about middle eastern food, Kaza Maza will make you a fan."}
{"text":"I had a huge craving for middle eastern food....... found this restaurant with good reviews and decided to give it a try. We reserved via OpenTable for a Tuesday evening. Luckily we did!! as we were a large group (8 adults plus 2 children). To our surprised, the restaurant was pretty full for a Tuesday evening. We were seated at the back of the restaurant which was perfect, we had our little corner to ourself. The restaurant felt like home and cozy.
Plenty of paid parking on the street, but also saw on their website they have available parking spots at the back of the restaurant. Baby friendly place (but to be on the safe side, preferably reserve high chairs if needed as they only have 2 available).
From the menu, we ordered an entree along with 2 main meals per couple. Unfortunately, I didn't take any pictures... but you can refer to previous postings to confirm the portions they served were really generous! I ordered the mouhammara spread (with unlimited pitas) and the lamb kefta with eggplants. 
It was delicious!!!!! Loved the few bites of pistachios crunchiness inside the kefta. 
The next morning we were still talking about the restaurant how it was a good find, with good food and would definitely recommend and return."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the better restaurants I've been to. It is a bit outside of downtown Montreal, but you can walk it in about 35 minutes, or take a taxi or bus. For appetizers, try the fattouch salad (excellent), and for cold dishes, we had the muttabal and mousaqa'a, which they bring you plenty of pita bread for, and both were extraordinary.

Then, definitely give the giant shrimp with saffron tomato white wine sauce, perfectly cooked giant shrimp in a great sauce.

Great atmosphere, very well priced for Montreal, and as good as or better than anything else you'll find in the city."}
{"text":"Incredible! They have the tastiest middle eastern food and it's hard to find this level of quality among a slew of dodgy late-night kebab shops. I can't remember the names of specific things that we ordered but I can tell you that we were so impressed with everything we tasted and we can't wait to go back. I would recommend making a reservation because it was very busy when we went."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Middle Eastern food I've ever had. Standouts include the fattouche and the fattet makdous. The latter, particularly, was incredible. The fattouche looks plain but bursts with spice and herb. The negatives were that our server was quite unenthusiastic, and that the baklava was far too dry. Still, I enjoyed the meal greatly."}
{"text":"I came here for a quiet evening with my advisor, his wife and my partner in the summer of 2017. They gave us a cozy table by the window where we spent a long evening eating and chatting about the wonders of life. I loved the intimate ambiance this restaurant provided and the Mediterranean food was delicious too! I can't remember what we ordered specifically but everything was delicious from the soup to the starters and the entrees. The only issue was fighting for the bill at the end of the night!"}

We both want to go back again soon !"}

{"text":"I recently tried out this lebanese/syrian resto located on Parc Avenue and must say I truly loved their dishes. The resto itself  has a warm homey ambiance feeling to it..kind of felt like we were eating over at someone's house. The resto itself is small but could accomodate a group of 12 people max. Service is friendly. Now for the food...simply delicious and authentic! Packed with lots of flavor and truly enjoyed the wonderful combination of spices. Loved the humus, lamb, lamba pita and eggplant dishes and of course their kibbe!  They also have a tasting menu of entrees which gives people a chance to taste their delicious dishes. Great way to discover.....every bite was mouther-watering. The resto does have parking in back of resto but street parking is free after 6pm on Saturday nights.  Great discovery !  Simply put great lebanese, syrian food all for reasonable prices!"}

Les entrées sont généreuses (nous avons même pu en remporter) et le kefta... un délice !! Le vin libanais servi au verre accompagnait très bien ce repas ! 
Nous devrons y retourner : il nous manque des plats à découvrir !!"}
{"text":"Had the baba ghannouj, hummus, fattet makdous, and braised lamb shank in yogurt and tahini.  The food was absolutely exceptional, particularly the fattet makdous.  One of the best meals I've had in a very long time.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Was looking for a fairly informal and laid back Middle Eastern place in Mile End and couldn't find one with suitable reviews, so we chose this, knowing the prices were a nip higher than what we wanted.

We biked down and were offered a table fairly quickly, despite it being a busy Friday night and busy place. All of the waitstaff we pleasant, friendly, and respectful, managing multiple tables and our orders with a good pace.

The thing that blew my mind here was the food and two items in particular: the Baba Ganoush and the Pistachio Kibbe. Holy cow! These palate and mind-melting items when combined together on a piece of pita and chased with Arak took flavor to a new level. I've had a fair amount of very authentic Middle Eastern food on the east coast and in the U.A.E. and this is right up there with the best. The only food item that didn't wow was the muhammara, it was okay, but dry and a little flavorless.

This is a hurry on back to place, in my opinion."}

The first few times I went I'd have given it a 4. Everything tasted good, it just felt a little overpriced for the quantity served. 
Lamb Kefte and braised lamb were delicious - as were the salads and all the dips in the apps.  
The most recent time there was so much oil in the dishes - there much have been half an inch of oil in the round ramekin at the end - that it did not feel good. 
Only if someone told me this had changed, would I return. Actually - that's not true. I'd probably give it another shot as it really was great the first few times. I would just order carefully or ask about the oil content!
That's my piece of advice to you too if you go!"}
{"text":"We came in a group of eight, and ordered way too much - but everything was tasty for a new cuisine. The lamb shank is sizeable, and the potatos divine. The complimentary? pita and olives and hot peppers were so so i guess."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fantastic service. 

A friend of mine (from out of town) and I arrived right when they opened on a Saturday and pretty much had the place to ourselves. This meant that the staff was able to chat more and suggest and recommend different foods to us - which was great! We ended up trying things we would have originally overlooked!

The hummus with lamb was fantastic as was the lamb shank - but I'm fairly sure everything on the menu would have been fantastic as well!

I'm definitely planning on returning."}
{"text":"This is probably the best middle eastern restaurant I've ever been to. We had the tartare, lamb shank and ground lamb with eggplant and everything tasted amazing."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday dinner and made reservations beforehand. KazaMaza is a dimly lit and well-decorated resto with a cozy yet lively vibe. I shared the lamb shank, lamb kebab, potatoes, and baba ganoush. I enjoyed all of it, especially the baba ganoush, but I would have skipped on the potatoes as I ordered them assuming they'd be like the typical lebanese home potatoes with garlic sauce but they were more like fried potato slices sans the garlic sauce. Otherwise, the service was decent for the amount of customers that night. Although some people may complain about the mezzes being small in portion for the price but I found them typical compared to other Middle Eastern mezze style places. We each spent about ~$35 per person without drinks and dessert. Definitely reserve beforehand if you want to come."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant, qui propose une cuisine d'inspiration syrienne, est spécialisé dans les mézés, qui sont en quelques sortes les tapas des moyen-orientaux. En entrée, j'ai donc pris du Baba Ghannouj, que j'ai tartiné sur du pain pita. Le tout était savoureux, mais ne valait peut-être pas les sept dollars que ce mézzé coûtait. Ensuite, en plat principal, j'ai commandé un plat à base d'agneau, pour me faire répondre qu'il n'y avait plus d'agneau, ce qui est pour le moins étrange pour un restaurant syrien. J'ai finalement choisi un sprême de poulet à l'ail en plat principal et j'ai l'ai apprécié. Aussi, le service était assuré par le propriétaire lui-même ce soir-là, alors que nous étions les seuls clients dans ce restaurant. Sans doute la situation était-elle dû à un concours de circonstance malheureux, mais le service était très lent. Bref, si vous souhaitez découvrir la cuisine syrienne, allez-y. Cependant, si vous souhaitez simplement ous offrir une bonne table, je crois que vous en aurez davantage pour votre argent en allant ailleurs."}
{"text":"It was a very nice meal and their main dish is a creative one. I went with friends and we all enjoyed what we took. I took one mezzas which is he sojouk and was very nice and well seasoned. 

Heir main dish filet with wine is amazing. Ambiance: the decor is nice but no real ambiance, no background music nothing. But a little bit noisy."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but the ladies room looked and smelled so unpleasant that I couldn't enjoy the dinner and won't go back."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday this year, and after having lived a year in Lebanon and tasting what I thought was the best Lebanese food ever, I was totally humbled.  
This was in fact, the most delicious Mediterranean food I've ever had, of any genre, hands down.  
As a semi-vegetarian (fish only), there were tons of options for me, each one yummier than the next.  I was floored by the Fattoush, then had this brilliant looking purple mezze called Mouhammara, which I'd never experienced before.  The Baba Ganoucj, Hummus, Eggplant dish and Salmon were divine, and though I left having over-eaten, it was a good-full feeling, as all of the ingredients were fresh and natural.  The atmosphere was relaxed, yet sophisticated.  If I lived in Montreal, it would be my regular spot."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find a Lebanese restaurant in Montreal and this was place was pretty good and the staff was nice.

This is hands down the best fattoush I have ever had, the salad by far upstaged everything else that I ate.  Everything else I ordered was good to okay."}
{"text":"Brunch was decent but not exciting. Shame about the pitiful service and the 35-minute wait especially when the place was less than full."}
{"text":"great Kafta.... tried both w/ Aubergine and w/ Pomegranate, wonderful Syrian food;... only thing a bit concerting was the neighborhood around the restaurant which was a bit run down w/ graffiti all around.  that did not interfere with our enjoyment.  Very helpful people."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for myself and two girl friends, and we had an amazing time. The food was colourful, so flavourful, and beautifully presented. If no one were around, I would have licked the plates off. This was also my first time trying Lebanese red wine and it went great with what we ordered."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals of my life!!  We came with a large group and ordered a little of everything as instructed by our waitress.  I loved the ambiance, the service and the food was amazing.  This is a must try close to downtown!!"}
{"text":"Délicieux, authentique et chaleureux sont en effet les 3 meilleurs mots pour d'écrire Kaza Maza. Les serveurs sont adorables, la cuisine pleine de saveurs et l'ambiance très chaleureuse. Si vous êtes curieux comme je l'ai été, je vous conseille d'essayer leur formule de 3 mezzes pour $20. Il vous faudra choisir entre plusieurs petites assiettes de spécialité libanaises qui sont toutes à tomber. Bon à noter, le hummus est délicieux mais très ailé.. peut être à éviter si vous êtes en amoureux :)"}
{"text":"Wow! Really? After coming here from LA I thought it was impossible to have it all at a Montreal restaurant; amazing food, good service, charming and classy atmosphere and modestly priced! But this place has it all! House wine is pretty good for $15 a 1/2 liter. 

The food was fresh and delicious! The decor is beautifully simple, the atmosphere is wonderful. Good date place for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! The only place in Montreal that ive been to that serves 'fattet makdoos' (which is eggplant fette. Reminded me of hamadiyeh souk breakfast restaurants back home in Damascus! Atmosphere is awesome and cozy. A great place for a date. The owner is very friendly, and everything i have eaten there is outstanding."}
{"text":"I really didnt like the food, especially considering the price, but it's a question of flavor and personal preference. I've never had these flavors before, and it didnt help that the entrees I chose (Mouhamarra, mousaqaa, stuffed vines...) were all cold, which i was told is how they're served. 

The olives they brought as sides were really bitter, and the Kefta my friends ate were so so. They put cold salad on hot kefta, so everything ended up being kind of cold.

Maybe it's enjoyable to eat cold cooked vegetables in Syrian heat but in Canadian winterish weather... Not my cup of tea. And the flavors, I just really did not enjoy them. Again, personal preference, but no one at my table took a liking to it. So warning, not for everyone.

I still recommend it for date night or a group dinner. I like the mood lighting, and service is diligent. It's worth trying once, you might like it!"}
{"text":"Went there twice last summer, both times sat outside at the terrace which is nice and charming. Menu consists of a wide variety of Lebanese dishes. We ordered a good number on of them and the food was very good in general and authentic. However the two times I went there the service was very poor; orders missing, rude waiters and table not ready despite making a reservation. Would go again for the food."}
{"text":"I have to say that compared to so many other middle eastern restaurants I have been to in Montreal, KazaMaza is quite average. I have been here twice and both times their service was ok. Also, their lamb shank portions are quite small. My friends who ordered the dish were still hungry. Plus, their chicken dish sells out quite fast so make sure you let them know your choice when calling to reserve a table. Lastly, for a middle eastern restaurant of this standard, they don't serve fresh pita bread."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing and the wait staff is very friendly and helpful. Have been here twice .... you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"If you think of Lebanese as shawarma and kebab, go to this place and go often. Love it."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant for syrian food. It is like a hipper, younger, light-spirited version of Aleppe. Highly recommend the potatoes, the hummus, and the chicken breast. Fattoush is good too. Youll need reservations on weekends not because theyre overwhelmingly busy, but because they arent very effective at distributing tables. Nonetheless, worth it!"}
{"text":"Salade fattouche et baba ganoush à se rouler par terre!
Rouleaux au fromage miam!
Ambiance chaleureuse."}
{"text":"wow wow wow .... Kazza Maza is definitely the gold standard when it comes to Arabic, middle eastern, Lebanese and Syrian food in Canada.   Amazing amazing flavours, service and ambience."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place on our first night in Montreal. This was the only place we could find that was open at 11pm in this area. Everything was excellent, from their lamb with garlic to their baba ghanouj to their special hummus-like side made from beet root. The owners were very nice. They were celebrating a friend's birthday that night and gave us slices of the birthday cake. 

They say when they opened the place, the focus was on the experience (they had great eclectic music on when we were there) and food was second but we disagree - food was really excellent. 

Finally, some things were missing from the menu. For example, they said they don't have falafel because they feel its gotten too commercial. So I wouldn't expect typical mid-eastern fare but whatever we tried was excellent."}
{"text":"Average food, overpriced and the staff is not friendly at all, i dont believe i'll ever be returning"}
{"text":"One of my favorite meals I've had in Montreal! We ate outside during sunset on their patio, splitting a bottle of wine and stuffing ourselves silly with hummus, baba ganoush, shaved filet mignon, grape leaves and lamb. 

The Greek wine we ordered on a whim was incredible, complimenting every dish perfectly. Every single dish we ordered was put together with such care and interesting little details, like pomegranate seeds on the baba ganoush. Highlight was the lamb shank, which was tender and spiced to perfection. Can't wait to return to Montreal so I can make my way back here."}
{"text":"This cosy and warm restaurant is a must if you enjoy Mideastern cuisine. Every dish we ordered was excellent, tasty, and well priced. The service was attentive and quick. I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Delicious, Fresh, Nice atmosphere.  Two of us split four appetizers and were full.  The wait staff was friendly and sweet.  The salad--mentioned in other reviews--was tasty, as was a beet purée dish we had.  Yum!"}
{"text":"My aunt and I went to Kaza Maza for dinner on a Friday night. We were lucky to get a table without reservations because we noticed that most tables had a reserve sign and the place filled up quickly. The restaurant is so cute and homey with brick walls. We shared the lamb shank braised in yogurt and tahini. The meat fell off the bone.  It was so good!! We also shared the garlic shrimp. The shrimps were big and let's be real... anything garlic is amazing! The dishes came with a side of rice and pita bread. Everything was delicious! We got a half bottle of house wine which was also pretty good. We shared a dessert (Aish el Saraya). It reminds me of baklava but doughy and you can really taste the rosewater. It was good and light! And of course we ordered the mint tea... mmm so good & refreshing! I would go back to this restaurant for sure !"}
{"text":"Kaza Maza was easily the culinary highlight of my trip to Montreal.  The spicy aroma of Mediterranean food hit us the moment we walked into this living room-turned-restaurant establishment. 

We decided to do this meal tapas-style and shared everything we ordered.  We started with a Lebanese Reserve red wine that was full of flavor and was an excellent combo with the food.  As an appetizer, we had the kibbe, which was a generous portion and cooked to perfection.  We moved on to an order of hummus and an order of baba ganoush.  I loved the hummus and my girlfriend loved the baba ganoush.  For our main, we got the fattet makdous, which was an eggplant dish with lamb crispy pita.  It was indescribable and equally amazing.  

We probably got a bit too much food but it was so good I can't say I regret it at all.  I wish this place were in NYC so I could eat there regularly."}
{"text":"This was the worst of the worse middle eastern food we ever had , we went there today 4 people we ordered 5 appetizers after we all tasted the food  we were all looking at eachother  like what the Muccck is this ,absolutely no taste in any of the food they serve , we ordered hummus it was swimming in the oil In fact there was so much oil olive hummus got so soft and felt like a melted ice cream . We did not even bothered to order a main course , after we left we were still hungry we went to Schwartz each one of us got a sandwich looooool. Btw when we were sitting at this so called middle eastern restaurant we did not see 1 person from Middle East , all there Customers are locals and students  I guess that Tells you something . Ooo b 4 I forget you should see the  narrow tables where you can hardly put any plates on it sitting is very uncomfortable tables are so tiny you can't even put your elbows on it . Restaurant is so loud ,plus they are so loud in the kitchen you even hear the Chopping sounds on the chopping board . We will never recommend this place to anyone . Now do they care? I don't think so iam sure when they read this review there respond will be like who cares if this customer did not like what we serve we are busy :))))) but my answer to the management is you are  busy with people who don't have experience with middle esteem food ,try giving this food to a Lebanese ,Syrian , Armenian person they will throw it yo your faces . Plus they are very very very expensive but that's ok I don't mind spending the money but at least give us authentic middle eastern food don't give us shit from a can an garnish with some stuff on it to make it look like authentic;) Shame on you guys shame shame shame ."}
{"text":"My first experience of Kaza Maza and its Syrian cuisine was very strong on the food end (fattet hummus!), but not so strong on the service end, but they were having a rough day and I recognized that (it happens). Recent experiences have been nothing but perfect (food and service both) and Kaza Maza quickly became one of my faves of 2010. 

Start with a selection of 3 or 5 of their phenomenal cold mezze, choose a fattet hummus from among the hot mezze, and go from there. Outstanding.  Friendly, too.  

Live music from time to time."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Lebanese restaurants around the world and can assure you that Kaza Maza ranks very close to the top, if not the top of this list. The menu is inventive and masterfully done. Try the three cold meze and choose the dishes made from beet and roasted red pepper (muhammara). I have not seen their like before. The lamb chops and kafte in pomegranate were incredible and full of flavor and texture. Trust the staff when they make suggestions, they know what they are talking about. This was one of the best meals I have had."}
{"text":"The food was extremely authentic compared to what I've had in Beirut. The baba ganoush, kefta, and beets were all very delicious. The service was a bit slow and clunky, but if you're not in a rush and like Lebanese cuisine, this is a perfect spot."}
{"text":"My enjoyment of Middle Eastern cuisine is a very recent occurrence. Part of that was never being exposed to it younger outside of bad shawarma at fast food joints. Hard to enjoy something when you've only known the bad stuff. My discovery of Sumac a few months ago peaked my interest in this cuisine and I'm now more inclined to try some stuff I perhaps wasn't previously. This came into play a few weeks ago when a friend of my girlfriend's invited us to a restaurant for what she called the best eggplant dish ever. The catch was she wouldn't tell us where we were going! The day of, she told us to meet her at Parc and Mont-Royal. Because I couldn't resisted guessing, I thought about possible restaurants nearby where an eggplant dish would be likely. My reasoning led me to Kaza Maza which is exactly where she brought us. I clearly have a little too much knowledge of Montreal restaurants at the moment!

Kaza Maza is located on Parc Avenue in a non-descript brickhouse. The space is sparse but nice - very much in keeping with the neighborhood and the building itself. Brick walls, white crown moldings, old wood floors, an old fireplace, minimal artwork and some nice chandeliers. There is also a bar which is nice but because of the layout of the space, it is not really intregrated with the dining room.

The menu is a variety of Middle Eastern dishes - most of which I had no clue about prior to entering the restaurant. As a starter, we went with a trio of spreads to go with some pitas. First was the mutabbal betteraves - roasted beet puree with tahini, yogourt, lemon and garlic. The vibrant pink colour of this dish is a clear indicator of just how much beet there is. I am not a beet fan generally speaking but I loved the flavour of this puree. Not overbearing in the least. The inclusion of the yogourt provided a nice smooth consistency.

The second spread was the mouhammara - ground walnuts with bread crumbs, pomegranate molasses and spices. A grainier consistency than the previously one and a much different flavour profile as well. Much more nutty and spiced with that hint of sweetness from the pomegranate molasses. Very enjoyable.

Our last starter was the one I already knew prior to this meal - Labneh. A thick yogourt, this was a rich, creamy and slightly sour spread that provided a perfect constrast to the other two.

Once we finished off the spreads, our mains arrived. First we had the arrayes kefta - Grilled pita stuffed with spiced minced lamb served with hummus and pomegranate molasses. To me, this dish was a slight miss. Compared to what we had so far, this felt fad and lacked strong flavour which is a surprise given the use of spiced lamb.

The grilled octopus with lentils was a much bigger success. The octopus was grilled perfectly....I simply wish there had been more! If that is my only complaint, you know the dish works well.

The final main was the catalyst for the whole evening - The fattet makdous - layers of fried eggplant, crispy pita bread, yogourt tahini sauce, garlic tomato sauce, pine nuts and almonds. Yeah.... this is an excellent eggplant dish. The use of crispy pitas seems weird when you read it in the description but it works beautifully to add some crunch to the mix. The sweetness of the tomato sauce, the creaminess of the tahini sauce, the nuttyness of the almonds and pine nuts - all of it works well with the fried eggplant and makes this a very satifying dish. Is it the best eggplant dish in Montreal? Not willing to go that far but it's top of the list for now!

For dessert, we had classic baklavas as well as. The baklavas, thankfully not drenched in honey, were just sweet enough without getting on my nerves - an issue I've always run into with baklavas. We also had what I believe to have been halawets - our waitress told us but I honestly forgot the name. Pretty good as well - once again, not too sweet and a nice creamy texture.

Kaza Maza was a great meal and a wonderful introduction for me to new Middle Eastern dishes. In cases like this, it is always great when I can order a meal of almost entirely unknown dishes and have a great night. I know that Middle Eastern cuisine isn't everyone's cup of tea but I highly recommend you give Kaza Maza a try and yeah... don't forget the eggplant dish.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"First time going there. Someone recommend the place. The whole team were extremely friendly, excellent service . Great food, reasonable prices. 
Definitely a place to go back to"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good food. And best of all, they have their own private parking lot behind the restaurant, and even though it's tiny, it's a life savor in such a busy area, especially on weekends"}
{"text":"Great food made with fresh ingredients at a very good price. The restaurant itself is very charming as long as the service. Will certainly go back."}
{"text":"I am in love with this restaurant, if only they hired better staff to handle the front of the house it would become a regular spot for me. The service is so slow but the restaurant is amazing. From my experience so far you really can't go wrong with whatever you choose to order from their menu. Great atmosphere and great food, hopefully the service speeds up and then its a perfect night out."}
{"text":"Everything I ate was amazing, and I mean everything! We went 4 friends with one of them being Vegan and we ate like little piglets!!! Amazing a must try. The Fatouche salad is a must, the grilled Lebanese cheese as well, the shrimp, the Kofta, the veggie Eggplant option, the Veggie Kebbe, I am dreaming of this food all over again.....not to mention the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Yesterday my cousins, husband and i took one of our cousins visiting from Germany out. We asked her what she wanted to eat and to which she replied Lebanese/middle eastern. So we decided to go to come here. Such a good choice! 

Everything we ordered was so good! From appetizers to main to desserts. We all shared various appetizers and i think that it was the best way on doing it. Like that, you get to try it all. As for the main, I ordered the kefta in grenadine and tahini sauce with rice. So much depth of flavours! My husband got the octopus. Braised and grilled to perfection! My cousin from Germany had the lamb. The meat fell right of the bone! The kibbé was very flavourful and the chicken really moist and tender!

They have a small wine list and are not very well equipped for specialty cocktails. You can maybe have a gin and tonic but that's about it. I chose to go with a private importer a was really happy with my choice. 

Good service. Great ambiance. Delicious food! Very reasonably priced! Omg i fell in love all over again with this type of food! I will be coming back very soon."}
