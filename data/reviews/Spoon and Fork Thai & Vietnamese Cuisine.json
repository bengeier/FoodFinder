{"text":"Nice ambiance, and decor . love the spoon and fork art all over the place including the sconces.  The food was good and they're running a summer all you can eat option where in you order anything thing off their menu for $22. Its a pretty good dinner deal. I got to try out near everything on the menu.  The shrimp in thick sauce is fantastic, they even replicated it in a vegetarian option as well.  The staff were friendly, polite and were making sure we were well taken care of!"}
{"text":"I went to Spoon and Fork recently for a family dinner. We chose the restaurant mainly because it was the only Thai restaurant in the area, and not because we'd heard positive reviews about the food.   Were we ever surprised! Well, I was anyway... I had the Curry Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp, and this was probably the best Pad Thai that I've ever had! It was most certainly spicy, and I can handle my heat (one of my biggest complaints about Pad Thai is that it is never quite hot enough). The shrimp was large and juicy. The chicken was quite tender. There was an abundant amount of peanuts, egg and tofu in the dish, which was nice too. All in all, I have nothing negative to say about the dish (I've gone back and ordered it again it was that good!).   As for the restaurant itself - It looks like it's recently been renovated. Clean lines, bright whites, dark wood, and decorative spoons and forks on the walls.   The service was fine, though a tad awkward as the servers weren't overly friendly and were a little slow in refilling our water.   I'd go back again and again for the food though. If you're a big fan of spicy Thai food make sure to try the Curry Pad Thai!"}
{"text":"Great Thai/Vietnamese food. Delivers quickly and in huge portions. A great menu to pick from as well.   The Rice was cooked to perfection and the sauces were just gravy (i crack myself up lol). All that's to say they were really really good curries. Have ordered from Spoon and Fork three times (girls night in/Scandal night/Pre-grocery night) and have yet to be disappointed.  I RECOMMEND: you try the calamari and any of the curries.   EXTRA TIP: Delivery available :)"}
{"text":"Was very impressed with the decor and food here for their all you can eat lunch. The food was very high quality, and the service was solid as well. Be aware they will keep refilling your water, in order to fill you up. As well, their \"shrimp\" pad thai had only one shrimp in it, which was disappointing. However, the food still tasted amazing.   The one drawback was the price; it cost almost $25 for lunch, which is pushing it for a student."}
{"text":"An excellent place to go for dinner at a reasonable price. Their menu has so many items that look really good, it is hard to choose just one.  The most recent time I was there I had the mango spring roll as a starter and the lemongrass chicken as a main. Both were very good. One thing that I really like about S&F is that they combine a whole bunch of flavours in their dishes yet no individual flavour overpowers the others, which is a problem I find with some Asian fusion places.  Their prices for dinner are very reasonable - dinner and an appetizer came to about $20.  The ambiance is great, and there is even a patio outside for nicer weather - although it's not the nicest patio I've eaten at."}
