{"text":"The atmosphere, the staff, and the food are the greatest. The restaurant has a relaxed and - welcoming atmosphere - I felt like we were treated like family. We we offered the tasting menu, but we decided to order a la carte based on some other Yelp reviews. Between the two of us we ordered and shared the brussel sprouts (5/5), strip steak (5/5), bangkhok bowl (5/5), burger (4/5) and a half order of the truffle gnudi (3/5 - I was a little disappointed with this dish). All the dishes (with the exception of the truffle gnudi) were nicely presented and absolutely delicious! My husband had some delicious cocktails with the recommendation of staff.  We were too full for dessert, so can't comment. I highly recommend you go. Make sure to make a reservation as this restaurant gets quite busy. I can't wait to go back in the summer when their patio is open."}
{"text":"Great spot! Lots of great flavours! Loved the octopus. Everything was great, except for dessert."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for 2 on a Thursday night. It was very busy - no one was waiting for a table but almost every table was full. It was mostly an after-work crowd. Dress code seemed to be casual or business casual - you could be dressy if you wanted to. I would recommend for 2-4 people and not for a large group. Reservations are a must - especially on a Monday night when they offer a $35 tasting menu and $5 drinks.  Food: 4/5 - we had the \"The Experience\" which is a tasting menu for $60 per person. These are the dishes we had listed from most to least liked (along with their individual plate price if you don't get the tasting menu): 1) Truffle Gnudi ($19) 2) Burger ($17) 3) Jerk Fish Board ($29) 4) Chopped Salad ($14) 5) Bangkok Bowl ($24) 6) Dessert - Sticky Bun ($10) 7) Shawarma Toast ($13) 8) Veg Slate ($15) 9) Brussel Sprouts ($10) 10) Complimentary - Mini Muffins - this was a great experience to try most of the plates for your first time at this restaurant - fairly small tapas plates but some were more filling than others - almost all of them were tasty and well-balanced. If I had to choose what I would order again, it would be the truffle gnudi, the burger, and the chopped salad  Service: 5/5  - no complaints - great service  I will definitely be back here with a reservation on a Monday night."}
{"text":"Looking for a way to beat back the Monday blahs? Rasa has a special set Monday dinner accompanied by live music. This definitely makes Mondays more tolerable by having something to look forward to that night! To start off our work week right, my wife and I decided to head out to Rasa.  The dinner started off with a small snack and that was a potato chip topped off with cheese, beans and other goodies. It may have been small, but it was a delicious start to the meal.  Next up was their chopped salad, which was shared between myself and my wife. Neither my wife nor I get too enthused by salads, but this one was an interesting mix. It contained a number of veggies and other ingredients that went very well together, and I loved the use of crispy chickpeas in it.  After the salad, we each received our own appetizers, which you can choose from a slate of three. We ended up choosing the po boy bites and the cauliflower fritters. We both enjoyed these two dishes, but they weren't too memorable.  Finally, we get to our mains, where again, we each choose our own from three options. I got their cheese steak sandwich which was packed with thinly sliced beef tongue, melted cheese and slathered with sauce, all between two slices of cheddar focaccia bread. This sandwich was surprisingly good! The bread was so soft and the tongue was nice and tender. This was one of the best tasting sandwiches that I have had recently. My wife got the grilled octopus, which she really enjoyed. Certain parts of the octopus were just a tad mushy, but the pork belly was so good! The sweet glaze on that crispy pork belly made it really tasty.  Even though the dinner ends with a small sweet snack (for that night, it was a piece of fudge), we opted to get the full sized dessert since it was just five dollars. What we got was full plate of chocolate chip waffles, chocolate granola and vanilla pudding. It all made for a nice dessert.  Overall, we had a fantastic night out! The food and service were both great, plus we got to enjoy it all while listening to a live band playing some cover songs."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place as a group of 6 last week. Waitress was friendly and of course recommended their tasting plate for $60 a person. We chose to instead have individual entrees as that was a bit much for our college student tastes. Four of our group chose appetizers to share but my girlfriend and I did not.  This is where the main issue arose, they brought our entrees out at the same time as our groups appetizers, which meant we had to sit through the rest of the table eating their meal while we had already finished. The waitress was even rude about this acknowledging that we are getting nothing for the mains, yet it is their fault for bringing them out too early.  The food itself was decent, had nice presentation, but some things weren't great, a member of our group had the chicken and wasn't impressed. The brussel sprouts which were recommended were soggy not crisp. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Big fan. Delicious food and great service :)"}
{"text":"Went to Rasa a few weeks ago and loved the decor and ambience of the restaurant. We sat at the kitchen bar and the service was wonderful. We tried the dumplings, truffle gnudi, veggie slate, and the burger. All of the food was delicious at the time but I had the worst food poisoning of my life afterward and was very surprised and upset after enjoying the meal so much. I hadn't eaten anywhere else before Rasa so I am sure that is what it was from. I am assuming that this does not happen often at Rasa but it was still extremely upsetting that a restaurant of this caliber would allow food contamination to occur."}
{"text":"Rasa continues to be one of our favourite restaurants in the city. Just added a summer pea dish that was absolutely amazing. Great food and great people"}
{"text":"My girlfriend picked this place for my birthday dinner and it was fantastic! Had the chopped salad, fish board and burger, all were great. Looking forward to going back and trying a few more of their offerings!"}
{"text":"I have been to Rasa twice - once for dinner and once again for brunch on my birthday in late October.   Not only is the food creative, interesting and delicious but the wait staff are pleasant and helpful.   The only unfortunate part is that it has become so popular you can't just walk in off the street anymore.  C'est la vie, I'll suck it up and make a reservation.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My friends and I went for Set Monday - 40$/person and 5$/drink.  The food was very nice. We started with a snack (corn soup of some kind, in shot glasses and topped with popcorn) which was very tasty; then moved on to the chopped salad, which was my favourite course, as it was fresh, flavourful and zesty; then I had the adobo roll while my friends had the smashed potato. My adobo roll was nice and I had no complaints. For our mains, I got the Bangkok Bowl and my friends got the burger and the truffle gnudi. The Bangkok Bowl was very flavourful, and reminded me of mango salads that you get from Thai restaurants. I tried a bite of the burger, which was fresh, but looked lonely without any fries or other kind of side. We got ice cream topped dessert squares (that tasted like gingerbread) to finish off the meal.  The wines were decent. You really can't go wrong at 5$ a glass! The service was friendly - attentive, without being pushy.  The portions weren't tiny, but also weren't huge. Which makes me think that I would return for another Set Monday, but might not order a la carte on a regular night, as the prices aren't super cheap.  Good job overall, Rasa."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience at Rasa this evening. We went in a group of 10 and the manager Adam was so accommodating of our requests in organizing the evening. Loved the size and atmosphere of the restaurant. Our server gave us incredible service, very knowledgeable and helpful with menu guidance, attentive and didn't rush us in the slightest. And of course, the food - everything was delicious! Chopped salad totally lived up to the reviews, we also enjoyed the Bangkok bowl, burgers and short rib. Our server even arranged for cheese-free individual portions of our apps for a party member that is lactose intolerant, without us even asking!  10 out of 10 on all counts!! Thanks Rasa!"}
{"text":"In Toronto for the weekend and went here for brunch. Had the burger melt and loved it. Not the brunch type, so that's a good thing.  The restaurant does not have AC but since there wasn't a lot of people inside and the air flow was good so it wasn't bad considering it was 26C outside.  Ambiance was good and a nice music selection for brunch time."}
{"text":"Went to Rasa this passed weekend for my boyfriend's birthday. The atmosphere was very welcoming with great music and we were immediately greeted by friendly staff. Everyone at the restaurant was extremely knowledgeable of the food and answered all our questions about the food. Because we found everything on the menu appetizing and couldn't choose on our own, we opted for the tasting menu ($65).  The tasting menu was about 8 courses and was the perfect amount of food. I loved the variety in the tasting menu dishes, as they were all from the actual menu but came in the most perfect order. We started with the chickpea salad (my favourite!), and then had amazing other dishes such as the tuna tartare, roasted vegetable platter, and the truffle gnudi. All were perfectly seasoned with each one having unique elements and perfect platting.   For dessert, we were given both the cereal and the sticky pecan bun. The cereal was the perfect amount of sweetness after having the strong flavoured truffle gnudi.   The cocktails were also great! I forgot the name of the one I had, but it had a rose-scented ice cube, which made the cocktail absolutely perfect.  I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? I guess with the fact that yesterday was a milestone birthday for me, and my partner and I decided to try Rasa for a celebration dinner with a close friend. We had seen the restaurant while on Harbord a few months ago, saw the patio was hopping, and on researching reviews, were pleased to see very positive feedback from patrons. We had early reservations, so they staff were just finishing setting up the patio, but we were seated promptly. Then, the class A service really got started with Benji, our server. He was the most down to Earth, friendly, sociable server we have had. Absolutely delightful. The other staff who brought food, bussed and filled our water glasses were equally friendly.   Benji helped us choose a couple of delicious cocktails - the beer menu was a bit limited- and we were set to order our dinner.  Now, to the food. Rasa is shared plate/tapas style. We knew we had to try the chopped salad and burger because of the awesome reviews they had received. We also were curious about the truffle gnudi, which Benji our server recommended. We decided to add to these the lamb and chicken.   The salad came first in a photogenic presentation deserving of inclusion in the birthday photo album. Very unique flavours, and crunchy chick peas got the meal off to a fine start. Then, the Gnudi. Oh my! So this is what fungi taste like in heaven! Positively the best mushroom experience of my culinary life! But for me, the absolute pinnacle of the evening was the burger. As Benji promised, the best in the city. I could hardly believe the juiciness of the meat, and the overwhelmingly delicious mixture of flavours in the toppings.   Finally, for dessert we were treated to the Sticky Bun topped with a sparkler in honour of the occasion. Perfectly sweet and nutty, surrounded by a light accompaniment of cream cheese anglaise, and bacon, this was a wonderful finish to one of the best meals I've had in this city of fine cuisine.  Thank You, Rasa!"}
{"text":"Rasa is a fantastic dining experience. The atmosphere is very warm and cozy.  We had a number of things including the delicious chopped salad. The octopus was cooked to perfection and the beef ribs are mouthwatering and to die for! These were the best beef ribs we have ever had.  Besides, we had some digestif cocktails and the aperol spritz was a delight. As for the dessert part, the sticky bun with candied bacon hit the spot and my husband has not stopped raving about the candied bacon since.  A big thank you to the Rasa team for a perfect dinner! We will be back"}
{"text":"It's a very unique place. walking distance from U of T. Staff there are very friendly and polite. We didn't make reservation, but we were lucky to have a table for an hour. We tried the burger and the chopped salad. they are super good.   Make reservations before you go!"}
{"text":"Cool eclectic restaurant with heat lamps outside when it gets cold on their patio.  We had the coconut broth brazino, the salad, the burger and the sticky bun for dessert. These were all excellent.  The salad had crispy chickpeas which were delicious. The burger was cooked rare and tasted incredible and the sticky bun was a must-have."}
{"text":"3.5/5! Great cute spot on Harbourd Street. I recommend the mini muffins, Toast (with the meatball for sure), spare ribs and the chopped salad. I would avoid the Beef Ragu and fish board (nothing special about either dish). This restaurat has potential for 4/5 except the service was disappointing. The waitress asked us to hurry up so when we finally asked for the bill she took over 20 minutes. It was her fault it took us so long to finish as the dishes took forever as did the bill. You need a lot of patience for this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here with our one year old on a Saturday early evening. They warned me beforehand they did not have any high chairs so we kept our little one in the stroller. We were given a table close to the doors and had plenty of space.   We ordered a few dishes including truffle gnudi, pork wings and popcorn chicken but the popcorn chicken stood out. The pork wings were very good and it was a large portion. We couldn't finish and took this home. My only regret was we did not have time for dessert. We will be sure to come back for that!"}
{"text":"We tried the Brooklyn Tequila cocktail, Chopped Salad, Street Corn, Albacore Tuna and Secreto Pork.  All are highly recommended.  Staff were also excellent.  We showed up without a reservation but they fit us in on the patio after a less than expected wait.  A very enjoyable visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved our visit to Rasa. The ambiance is amazing - cool but unpretentious with a great patio and a warm, open feel inside, plus a great view to the kitchen. Staff were attentive and friendly. The food was really delicious. Particular standouts were the fish board, the cabbage rolls, the chopped salad (I could eat this every day) and the steak tartare. Reasonable portions and really thoughtful flavour combinations - inventive yet familiar. Good drinks, too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"YUM!   I love there concept of shared plates that aren't small plates! I enjoyed the tuna tartar, wagyu ribs, and the dumplings! Everything was delicious. We also had many cocktails from there impeccable list!"}
{"text":"Amazing food -- so many flavors and textures that all work together to create a great dining experience. The Brussel sprouts and octopus were particularly good, but none of our 7 dishes missed the mark.  The service was also friendly and attentive, but never rushed."}
{"text":"Amazing and unique sharing dishes and mains. Great dirk menu n wine selection. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"rasa is a little bit of heaven on earth.  the service was without compare - and since mediocre or bad customer service anywhere is a major pet peeve of mine, that is quite a compliment coming from me - and the tasting menu was quite special.  i am not a big sangria fan, and even the sangria was pleasing to my taste.  it was something different - although i can't remember what - but it was yellow instead of red.  we started with the chopped salad, which is a perfect medley of flavors and so addicting that my dinner companion wanted to just eat that all night.  but that did not make sense, as we signed up for the works (the tasting menu, of course).  then came the truffle gnudi and the bangkok bowl, both delightfullly delicious as well.  the sweet surprise at the end was indeed a treat.  they had live music, which always kind of makes me nervous in a small place like this, but the volume was perfect and the young man who sang that night offered up a nice mix of soft and classic rock, from the 60's and 70's and 80's, and it was a perfect complement to a perfect meal.  we even thought about going back during our brief stay in toronto, but ended up exploring other places.  but you must definitely make this a stop if you are ever in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"What a surprise!!!! Went there on Friday April 8th.The food is stunning and you can literally see that the chef is working every piece that is place on your dish. It is flavorful, super tasty and well balanced. The restaurant is well decorated and the music nice. Staff is super nice and will make sure that you have everything you need without you noticing them. The only thing that was missing is a basket of bread. Mini muffin are great and can't replace the bread (too rich)."}
{"text":"I spent a wonderful evening at Rasa at the outdoor bar. It was a fabulous warm Toronto evening with the sun setting matched by the warmth of the service at the bar and the friendly staff that brought us to our seats.  The food was delightful and unique which saw us enjoying every morsel. We enjoyed a tapioca amuse bouche to start the meal followed by shaved beets and flavourful brussel sprouts. I really enjoyed the sea bream with some fantastic chilis which enhanced the wonderful flavors. The restaurant is busy both in the evenings and Sunday brunch so be prepared but any wait is well worth it."}
{"text":"Celebrated my husbands birthday here Friday night with our sons and a girlfriend. There was a slight mix up with our reservation and Adam, one of the owners, went above and beyond to make it up to us the entire night. He sent over complementary Prosecco, which was one of the best we ever drank and certainly more than made up for their booking error. However, he also surprised us with the amazingly delicious Brussels sprouts and a trio of desserts.  All three fish boards, the Bangkok bowls and truffle gnudis were especially delicious options. Every dish here is a work of art and tastes as gorgeous as it looks.  This is our third visit here and we love it as does everyone we have recommended this restaurant to.  Looking forward to their fabulous patio, which is going to get even better this year with the addition of oysters.  AWESOME"}
{"text":"5+1 star!! Love love love this place! This was my 2nd time here. Small cozy place with dimmed lighting. Friendly servers with great service. Call them or text them to make a reservation. (Open Table doesnt show any available time for weekends) They have changed the menu slightly but everything was amazing. We ordered 8 dishes:  Chopped Salad Brussels Sprouts Truffle Mushroom Pork Ribs Octopus Wagyu 2 desserts  Nothing disappointed me. Every single dish had an unique flavour with perfect spice. I also want to give a bonus star to their presentation. All dishes were aesthetically pleasing. My favorite was the Truffle Mushroom. I never tried such a flavorful dish with just veggies. My friends and I shared all dishes but next time I come, I will order the truffle mushroom just for myself. This dish was sooo delicious. I meam everything was... now my mouth is watering thinking about this already. Lol"}
{"text":"Just went this past Saturday with a girlfriend, the restaurant is pretty tiny so luckily we made reservations in advance. What we ordered:  Chopped Salad 5/5: delicious!  Gnocchi 3/5- the mushrooms and sauce that went with it was delicious but the gnocchi was way too dense and big, the plate didn't feel balanced.  Burger 5/5: juicy and fresh bread, we shared half and it was perfect Ceviche: 5/5: my favorite dish of the night!   Service could have been a tad more interactive. We got the chopped salad and ceviche pretty quickly but then the gnocchi and burger didn't come until 30 minutes after, I think that wait time was way too long.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We went for brunch at Sunday, the chopped salad and smashed potatoes are amazing, and all staffs are nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Came here for a second dinner while restaurant hopping. Walked in and there were no spots but we checked out a dessert and came back after two hours and got seats at the bar! What a viewww! We loved checking out the dishes as they were prepared and given out!   We just ordered a couple of dishes to try. Strip steak - gorgeous presentation and subtle flavors! The med rare thin slices of steak went well w the jalepeno, picked shrimp, schmaltz, subtle fish sauce mayo and yummy chicken skin! Couldn't stop eating this one!   Smoked branzino w dill creme fraiche, orange caviar, beets and mustard crisps - the mustard crisps went really well w the dill creme fraiche and smoked fish! Omg yum!! Maybe I'm biased BC I loveeee smoked anything but my friend and I both loved this dish!   Sticky bun w walnut praline, cream cheese anglaise, n candied bacon - when we both laid eyes on this, we knew this was the One ... dessert that we HAD to get! It looks like a huge cinabon topped w drizzled goodness, walnuts and omg of course two strips of candied bacon! Totally had me at bacon and totally had me at cinabon. It tasted as good as it looked. Definitely the choice for those w an extreme sweet tooth !!   Food was awesome. I'm definitely coming back to try their cumbraes beef (which looked rly good n filling) and their burger!   Service was great! The bartender was really attentive and the owner was so nice!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the city.  Highly recommend the tasting menu!  Great price and huge portions - we left stuffed.  Friendly service, and very accommodating. You can also request specific dishes that you'd like to try."}
{"text":"A simply great restaurant experience, every time.   Rasa is the perfect neighbourhood spot for dinner or brunch. The menu is always plentiful with options to keep everyone happy, and the plates themselves are lively with colour and texture.  For dinner, service has been impeccable and the place is remarkably full at all times. Yet, not too loud. Just right. It's not uncommon to run into a friend here, or maybe make a new one if you sit up by the open kitchen. Memorable hits are the gnudi with wild mushrooms, chickpea salad and the juicy burger. The amouse bouche is always an appreciated beginning. The dessert menu is small but mighty. Not sure if they still have it, but they had a cinnamon bun on the menu that was/is a rival for best in the city.   Sunday Brunch is also not to be missed. The breakfast burger is fantastic and inventive takes on the classics are just what the doctor ordered for your hangover. Wish this was on every day of the week!"}
{"text":"Definitely deserving of all the wonderful reviews. Was here with some friends and we were all very happy with our meals. The rasa snack was lovely to start, and Chopped Salad and Jalapeno poppers delicious apps to share. Octopus was beautifully cooked. Drinks were inventive, tasty and strong!  Best part was the super friendly, unpretentious service. Everyone was very warm and welcoming and an extra dessert was even brought out when they heard it was my birthday- such a nice touch. I will definitely be back to try out more on the menu!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of great things about Rasa and decided to finally check it out. I shared the \"experience\" (tasting menu) and tried the pork chop. Everything was thoughtfully prepared and the cocktails were also great. The items are priced based on quantity, so the higher the price the larger the dish."}
{"text":"I came here last week with a couple of friends and we managed to try almost all of the dishes on the menu.  Service was absolutely wonderful. Our server guided us through the menu perfectly and brought out our dishes in such a thoughtful and well-paced manner. He really made the dining experience exceptional.  The food was so flavourful, unique and absolutely delicious. Our absolute favourite dish of the night was the wagyu shortribs. So so good. We could have eaten a couple plates of those if we hadn't already filled up on all the other plates on the menu.   There's honestly something for everyone to enjoy here so I recommend you come here with a good appetite, good friends, and try as many dishes as possible. I can't think of a better way to spend a couple hours with buddies."}
{"text":"Superb service. Strawberry lemonade was very good, however it needs to be diluted to 1/3 or less for any people who do not keen on sugar. I forgot the name of my entree. It was mushroom dumpling, fresh and flavourful. Sticky bun was not too sweet, and seems to be made by order. The candied bacons were tasty."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for sharing tapas. We had the fish board, brussel sprouts and adobo chicken.  Octopus was a little overcooked but otherwise everything was incredible. Excellent cocktail menu as well, they have put their own spin on a variety of classics."}
{"text":"I came with a group of 6 for their Monday set menu.  I must say, everyone was pleased with the various dishes; the only thing that wasn't a hit was the matcha glazed donut one of us ordered.  Everything else from the chopped salad, the po boys, chicken wings, truffle gnudi, burgers, and bangkok bowls were a hit.  Service was friendly and informative, and all around made for a lovely experience.  I will happily return to this restaurant and spread the word."}
{"text":"Like others have said, start with the tasting menu. Then beg for more chopped salad, because one bowl of it wont be enough. The tasting menu is a good way to begin here. The burger was a little on the salty side though, but would still get it again. Also appreciated the different beers they had available."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and sat on the patio both times - perfect for a nice day out with a glass of wine and tapas.  The lamb shank and pork ribs were both very delicious, especially the lamb paired with sweet potatoes. The ceviche was fresh and tasty as well!  I'd love to visit and try the Monday menu at $40."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was deeeeelish! But... For the price ($$$) I'm not sure I'd be back. We ate on the patio which is nice (though noisy with traffic), but I don't think I'd enjoy dining inside... Seems a little dark and dingy.   Was worth a try but I think there's better out there to blow my dollar dollar bills!  P. S. Sticky bun desert was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is a cozy little gem in the neighbourhood.  Staff was very helpful and patient in giving recommendation.  After tasting the food you can tell they uses fresh ingredients.  The Wagyu Beef Burger (very juicy beef) and Truffle Gnudi is a must try.  Highly recommend! They do reservation with text message but am totally ok because they were very responsive!  Will come again :)"}
{"text":"Ambience: If ever a bunch of hipsters with carpentry skills assembled a frontier bar this is what it'd look like, instead it's in the heart of college town. And like a frontier bar, it is loud and alive with live music.   Food/value: Great for what you pay and creatively dished out. They've set menu & a-la carte. We went with former for 40$ pp. They do have corkage for 30$/bottle, should be around 20$ in this location.   Service: Fast, but a bit inexperienced and at times abrupt, but overall friendly.  Repeat: Yes"}
{"text":"Second visit was even better than the first!  Very impressed.  We went with the tasting experience again (new items).  Texture of the CHOPPED SALAD (chickpeas) was perfect this time.  EGGPLANT with red miso and frozen yogurt sounded odd but tasted delicious! SHRIMP with smoked tomato/chimichurri/black rice was the weakest dish of the eve but still interesting. FRIED CHICKEN with tofu/avocado/sambal was a savoury fav.  WAGYU BEEF with sea asparagus/cucumber/nori chips was phenomenal despite me forgetting to ask for it rare.  The SEMIFREDDO (dessert) was a knock-out win: smoky, velvety, chocolatey and cool.  I loved it, and I'm usually not a dessert person at all.  Service was amazing/friendly once again.  Just found out they also do brunch so we'll definitely have to come back to try it!  This resto is a new fav!  *Edit: Went back a 3rd and 4th time -- the SEMIFREDDO has changed. Would no longer recommend it. Now it's just a blob of weird chocolate, nothing at all like it used to be. But they always seem to have something new to try"}
{"text":"I was able to get a last min rezzie for one while in town for work on a Wednesday eve. Service was friendly and well paced (not slow, as I'd seen someone complain about). The menu was inventive and food was all tasty, though nothing totally extraordinary. I had the chorizo empanada - very tasty. Though I'm not a super fan of the tomatillo salsa, it paired well with the charred pumpkin seeds. I wasn't thrilled with the Brussels sprouts. Some of them were still hard and difficult to cut through. But more importantly, I wasn't a huge fan of the vinegar + cheese sauce combo. Maybe it's because b sprouts are so delicious on their own - they need very little and the strong flavors were competing with the natural yumminess. I really enjoyed the mushroom dumplings/gnocchi-like things (forgetting fancy name). So many kinds of mushrooms. But a tad on the salty side. Thus dish was large and I could only eat half. I ended with the sweet of the week, a kind of strawberry shortcake number. It was fine. Nothing exciting. Overall a positive experience with good food and a cool vibe."}
{"text":"This place has got all the requirements of a great restaurant in my opinion: great food, fantastic staff, nice atmosphere and top notch service.  Came here for a small birthday dinner and I thought it was a seamless experience. Tess who handled my reservation was very accommodating to all my last minute seating changes ha. I love how they do reservations through text messages, super handy for busy folks!  Food wise I can only speak about the set menu they do on Monday nights. For $35 you get a table salad, app, main and a shareable dessert. They also have $5 wine, rail and beers so it's well priced for Toronto standards. I had the cauliflower fritters which were light and fluffy. The grilled octopus was delish (and big!) - the refreshing apple slaw, crispy pork belly and meaty octopus was a winning combo. Dessert was a playful bowl of ice cream and chocolate granola cereal with a little banana foam. My friends had the dumpling app which also looked amazing! Sometimes set menus let you down but not this one and they do change it up regularly!   The live music on Monday nights is actually really lovely. Light acoustics and nothing too loud where you can't have a conversation. There is a great ambiance to the place, perfect for a date night or casual dinner/drinks with friends.   The staff though were what made the difference in my opinion. Took the time to wish me happy birthday throughout the evening, get a little gift card and came by to check up without being a bother. I'm very picky about service as I work for a restauranter that  emphasizes service constantly so I'm pleased to say I was impressed."}
{"text":"A tasting journey like no other place I've been to in Toronto.  My friend and I did the Rasa Experience and we were able to make requests of what items on the menu we wanted in it and the rest was a delicious mystery.  The staff was all very friendly and helpful and on the ball attentive.  We started with the Rasa snack which was a shot of a lentil soup with some nice spices.  Some of our favourite stand out dishes (even though everything was good):   Smoked Arctic char.  It was delightfully paired with slices of fresh grapefruit, crispy nori and some wonderful sauces.  The combination of flavours was something neither my friend nor I had ever had.  Chopped salad with crispy chickpeas and a jalepeno dressing that wasn't overly spicy.  Octopus with braised pork belly, crispy lentils wow this was my friend's absolute favourite and she said she had a \"moment\" due to its flavours and deliciousness.  The waygu short rib was delicious too.  We were SO stuffed the food just kept coming.  We were so full but had to have the sticky bun for dessert.  Warm and not too sweet.  Came with some crispy bacon!  We definitely had a wonderful dinner and highly recommend Rasa and would definitely come back.  They're doing it right here."}
{"text":"This place is my pick for favorite restaurant I've been in the last year. We sat at the bar which is preferable to the tight tables that don't allow for any privacy. But every Toronto restaurant seems to have that problem nowadays to pay their exorbitant rent. Every single dish was spot on. Very inventive take on dishes. Service was great, we got a free (and delicious) dark and stormy due to another patron having to make a reservation somewhere else. That works for me! The other cocktails were great too although I prefer a bit of a heavier pour. The dishes we tried:  1) truffle gnudi: We are both mushroom fiends and this was a total winner. The beautiful sear on the outside of the gnudi combined with the creamy ricotta made for a great textural contrast. The amazing walnut pesto complemented the mushroomy goodness perfectly.  2) burger: delicious and juicy on a warm brioche bun but this was my partner's so I only had one bite   3) short rib steak: the yummy pho dip and schmaltz potatoes were a creative addition to the delectable steak. It's these unique twists that is the reason one spends $ to go out. Definitely couldn't do this at home  4) sticky bun: incredible! The candied walnuts (or is it pecans) on top elevate the incredible doughy goodness   5) weekly dessert special of lemon curd crepe: so good and the little bit of citrus tartness helped balance out a fairly heavy meal    It is so rare for every dish to hit it out of the ballpark but Rasa did exactly that! We will be back for sure to try out the rest of the dishes!"}
{"text":"Wow...a snowy cold night and a fabulous dinner in a cozy warm restaurant...what more could you want? We shared a few dishes...chopped salad, drummettes & wagyu ribs...mouth watering & absolutely delicious. We also tried another dish that while tasty wasn't quite our taste. Our server noticed and to our surprise & delight they exchanged the dish for another and took the time to ask what we did & didn't like about it. This is an establishment that actually cares about what they're presenting to their clientele...it is a rare quality & greatly appreciated.  If you're looking for excellent food & service then you don't want to miss this new gem."}
{"text":"Crazy good place!  Feels like a New York spot, a below street level gem.  Try the chop salad (amazing tastes!) And the lamb speducci.   Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely top notch! All around.   I suggest letting your server or the host choose the menu for you, as it's constantly changing and packed full of very interesting things you might otherwise miss. This place is about nuance. The chef's put a lot of thought into the details.   For example, we had a very unique take on a make-your-own shwarma (think fajitas but with braised lamb, freshly made pita, and pickled vegetables). Presentation was beautiful. It was potentially the best thing I've ever eaten in a restaurant in my entire life.   Cocktails are made by professionals, with quality ingredients.  Atmosphere is made even more special if you remember Momo's (the middle eastern place that used to occupy the space). The Rasa guys have turned this place into a beauty and in general have created another great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"How this place isn't a 5 star winner boggles my mind!  I went for the Set Monday for $35 and was blown away. The chopped salad was the best (bold statement I know but I'm still thinking about it to this day).  The chicken wings were my least favourite item ordered and they were delicious. Even the veg dishes were yum.  And don't even get me started on the cocktails... ah-maz-ing!  The thing that really blew me away was the service. Great bunch of people who work there. Very friendly, helpful and chatty. I requested some recommendations and they were spot on. I was really impressed with their ability to go above and beyond their normal duties.  Yes portion are a bit small but worth the money once the flavour hits you. If you haven't gone yet you're missing out.  I will definitely go back to sit on their quaint patio to sip on more cocktails and try the regular menu."}
{"text":"On Monday, they have only one unique  course menu in amount of $40. You will have a salads,  an appetizer from 3 choices, entry from 3 choices and a small dessert.  They have full menu on other days but we actually enjoyed this Monday course."}
{"text":"I had the Asian Chopped Salad with Seared Tuna. Really tasty but only 2 slices of tuna (sashimi size)nor $16 - pricey salad for what you get. This was a delivery order - not dine in."}
{"text":"I made reservations for my best friend and I as we were having a belated birthday celebration for her.   Reservations: Booking was easy and was done through text. The person who takes care of reservations via text was great and answered all my questions and I found him/her to be quite accommodating. Because of their great service by text alone, I was looking forward to dining here and confident that I had picked the perfect place.   We arrived for our reservation right on time at 5:30PM and was greeted by a friendly server and we were seated right away.  Food: The food was amazing. Our server recommended starting off with 4 plates to share and so we ordered the chopped salad, truffle gnudi, the burger, pork loin and some cocktails within 15 minutes of being seated. Our cocktails were amazing and we were given a small treat to start, though tbh, I can't recall what it was called. They were 2 small round things w some sort of sauce and only okay. The texture was very similar to uncooked dough. Our first plate was the giant bowl of chopped salad (we came pretty close to licking the bowl clean but didn't) and then the gnudi and both were delicious However, this is where I had to knock off 2 stars: we didn't get our 3rd plate until almost 7pm. At 6:45pm I had to wave down our waiter and ask that the 3rd and 4th plate be served together as we were going to a Rugby game and it started at 7pm. My girlfriend and I were looking forward to eating dessert since the first 2 plates were so good, but we didn't have any time so we took off after quickly finishing out last plates feeling a little disappointed.  TLDR; Reservations were booked easily through text, food was greater, servers friendly and accommodating but service was very, very slow. Would I recommend to friends? I would tell them food was awesome but maybe go on a Tuesday instead of a Saturday and hopefully their food won't take as long."}
{"text":"Unreal food. This place was so good we went back a second time during our 5 nights in Toronto. Sit at the bar if you can and watch the plates come out. The salad with chickpeas and jalepeno feta is awesome. Hamburger great, fish great, everything is great."}
{"text":"We got a table outside easily on a weeknight. Staff was friendly and helpful. I split the chopped salad with my friend and then had the pork secreto. Both were delicious! I tried a bite of her Brussels sprout dish and that was really good too. Very nice, hip atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the dinner here. The cocktails are really well made and fragrant and beautifully presented, as is the food. Great lively ambiance, good wines, and really good service (although a few of the staff are a little too hip for you, the others are lovely and make up for it). It was a really interesting evening and they clearly take pride in their efforts."}
{"text":"Came back here on a whim and I am so glad I did! I finally got the experience everyone else is writing about.  Got the chopped salad, mushroom gnudi and some kind of steak I can't remember now.  Sat at the bar.  Service was great.  The mushroom gnudi was some of the best food I've had in Toronto in a long while.  Seriously memorable.  My only complaint is that the bathrooms are absolute horrid, like airport bathrooms.  I guess it is true that sometimes timing and company matter for the experience of a restaurant; I definitely had a positive experience and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I must say that Rasa was amazing! From the warm and friendly staff, who are as enthusiastic at 6:45pm as they are at 8:45pm to the incredibly tasting The Chopped Salad, Brussel Sprouts with scotch bonnet vinegar, cauliflower cheese to the Fish Board which included Albacore Tuna, tomato soppressata, fermented chili, garlic , Shrimp, with sherry cream, smoked tomato, chimichurri, black rice and finally Branzino with jerk coconut broth, was superlative. Great atmosphere, decent wine and cocktail list. Would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants an incredible dining experience, with fabulous food and exemplary wait staff. Ya gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"I went to Rasa last night and the service was fabulous.  The waitresses were friendly, polite and they had a lot of energy. The menu looked delicious but we just went in for dessert and drinks. The desserts were out if this world. I had \"The Chocolate\" and it was amazing. One of my friends had \"The Citrus\" and she said it was phenomenal.   This restaurant definitely changed the tone of our night. We started the evening at Harbord 93 and had a horrible experience. This place knocked Harbord 93 out of the water. I will definitely be back to try their entrées."}
{"text":"I've been to Rasa twice now and always with a small group, as they offer great sharing options. It's a small place and they get very busy, so be sure to make a reservation ahead of time, even on a weeknight. Announce your presence asap so they can start getting your table turned around if it hasn't been yet. On the last occasion, we ended up waiting an extra 30 minutes after our reservation time before we were seated. We saw two walk in couples get turned away and other groups waiting. We hung out by the front/bar area and ordered some drinks while we waited, not the most fun but it happens. After some time and without prompting, Rasa offered our first round of drinks on the house given our wait, which was thoughtful and appreciated.   Food wise, the fish board is a must. So creative and an explosion of flavours. I also thoroughly enjoyed the lamb and duck, the truffle gnudi is another must if you love mushrooms. I think I could have done without the octopus but it was great nonetheless and I find octopus is tricky.  On my first visit, I recall being pleasantly surprised with the freshness and variety of ingredients in the chopped salad too.  The place is a bit dark so not great for photo snapping, but awesome for being detached to the phone and enjoying present company. I also appreciated that the drink list isn't two miles long but offered great variety. The staff are knowledgeable about their wine and drink offerings as well if you're unsure.  I think next time I'll go back to try \"the experience \"!"}
{"text":"Wonderful and creative dishes. The polenta they serve as an appetizer is really delicious. The Gnudi with mushrooms is to die for. Great decor and attentive service. On Monday they have a prix-fix menu, which is great value for the money. I have also come in regular nights and it is very nice to have all the choice among all the interesting options in the menu. I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Everything here tastes amazing and the atmosphere is great. I came here with my girlfriend for our anniversary, and everything was lovely. We had the Burger, Fish Platter, and their special salad - all amazing. I mentioned this was my anniversary while making my reservation, and the staff were nice enough to treat us to a free drink :) Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great environment. Food was maybe 4/5 but staff were excellent. Would definitely come again.   Erica"}
{"text":"I don't know what took me so long to come here. Regardless, I'm so happy I did. Right away, my life was made easier by being able to make an actual reservation for brunch. There's nothing worse than waking up and running to a brunch spot and getting in line, not sure if you'll make it before closing or not.   The decor at Rasa is very trendy and chic, yet rustic and cozy. The brunch menu has familiar classics with a twist. We decided to go with the sweet plate of the day, which consisted of buttermilk waffles with rhubarb jam and earl gray ice cream and the burger melt, as well as a side of cheddar biscuits with chili jam.  The side of cheddar biscuits consisted of four fluffy biscuits that were magically so light. The chilli jam gave it a sweet and hot kick which elevated them to a whole other level. The burger melt is not for those that want to play around. It is juicy and stacked; however it does not come with any sides. The buttermilk waffles were like pillows of heaven, and the earl gray ice-cream gave it a refined michelin-star dessert feel--for breakfast. The service was excellent, and I walked away without that heavy brunch feeling. I can't wait to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Rasa deserves an updated review.   In my experience this is a winning neighbourhood spot. I have returned to it a few times and will gladly go back again.   Everything from the complimentary mini cornbread muffins to the addictive and beautiful mains (e.g. Bangkok bowl, octopus, truffle gnudi) are hits. I've had less success with a limited experience of their desserts, but who even needs them with the solid apps, salads and mains?   Tasty food with flair, but a relaxed feeling inside and out, which eliminates pretension."}
{"text":"It was my second time having dinner in Rasa. Last year, I had an amazing experience overall. This year, food was still excellent, but the service was bad. We had to wait for a long time between the courses. There is allowing time between the courses and there is painfully slow. We had the latter. The server had very little interest in us. She tried to take a plate I was still working on, right from under my spoon (and why such rush if I had to wait for my next dish for another 25 minutes)? I did not feel welcome at all. Overall, the place felt quite clicky - there were friends of friends eating and getting all kinds of attention and overpriced for tiny portions. There are plenty of places in Toronto with much better service and great food for less or the same price range, so I am not coming back."}
{"text":"Still right up there in terms of interesting food, excellent service and a different place to go. As before we had chopped salad, a delight in texture discovery, Brussel's to die for, Bangkok bowl, rather similar to the salad, yet, plenty of fish ( did I say that?), to find. Hot calamari, cool Tuna. Superb short ribs. Our second experience was in a dark space, difficult to really appreciate the colours of what we were eating."}
{"text":"I went to Rasa last night and I have to say that as someone who eats out a few times a week, this is the best restaurant I've been to in a long time. The atmosphere was cool, comfortable, and trendy - great music, dim lights, and a perfect date spot.  The service was excellent and the servers were really helpful explaining each dish.  We ordered \"the experience\" which is an 8 course tasting menu for $60 a person. What was really great about the tasting menu was that we were able to specify which dishes we really wanted to try and they made sure they were part of the tasting menu. We're also not big desert fans so they were able to accommodate and replaced desert dishes with other appetizers. Everything we ate was delicious and there wasn't one thing I wouldn't order again. We had the chopped salad, the \"caprese\" tuna, dumplings in a smoked chicken broth, jalapeño poppers, roasted vegetable medley, truffle gnudi, bangkok bowl with crispy calamari and a mango/jicima slaw, the hamburger, grilled octopus and glazed pork belly, and steak. Needless to say we were extremely full by the end of the dinner and as the name goes, it definitely was a food \"experience.\" My top choices would be the dumplings and the caprese tuna were definite highlights!  If I could make one complaint it would be that the restaurant was really drafty and every time the door opened I could feel the cool breeze at the back of the restaurant - I wore my jacket the whole time but this is something that could easily be fixed by the restaurant.  That being said, Rasa is a great new addition to the Toronto restaurant scene and a place I'll definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about Rasa, and was really looking forward to our meal here but our meal was a big let down. We went on a Monday and ordered the set menu. The chopped salad was average at best. The fried chicken did not have the crunchy on the outside, juicy on the inside feel that I expect from great fried chicken (try Guu, or Brock's sandwich Fried Chicken, both are legit) My girlfriend had the trout which was also mediocre. For dessert we had two chocolate chip cookies with wasabi drizzle on the side. The wasabi drizzle was a nice touch but the cookies were weak....a step above chips ahoy soft cookies. The positives from this place was that the burger was above average and the service was solid. I wish I could say better things as I wanted to like this place, but in my opinion it was very mediocre and overhyped by many people."}
{"text":"Great service, warm atmosphere and innovative food! Highly recommend it .  Another hit from the food dudes!"}
{"text":"I had previously given the food an excellent rating and now, I must say, the service is also excellent. The manager reached out to my husband and apologized for the previous mishap and asked us to return for a complimentary meal. We returned and had a wonderful evening. We will definitely be returning, with friends this time, so that we can order more shared plates ! Thank you, Rasa!"}
{"text":"I ate here about 2 months ago so I cannot recall exactly what we had. I can say however, that my friend and I were loving almost everything we ordered. If we did not love it, it was due to personal taste, not the fault of the chef, and I am fairly certain we still licked our plates clean.  We came on a fixed menu Monday and ordered differently so that we could share. The four stars is because I'll have to come back on  my next trip to try it all again, it's probably deserving of a 5. The service was fantastic. When they brought dessert we didn't eat it as we don't like nuts in our sweets. When we hesitantly expressed this, only because our server wanted to know why we barely touched it, he exclaimed, \"OH! we have some without nuts! I wish you had told me.\" Not expecting for him to bring us anything else (we were stuffed at this point and didn't need to eat more), he brought out the nutless brownies. They were totally worth feeling over the top full for. I cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Rasa three times now. The food excellent, the chopped salad and the fish boards are my favorites. However, time stands still at this place. Service is extremely slow and nowhere to be found when needed. One our most recent visit, for the time we spent there (an hour an a half) we could've have 3 drinks instead of one, if asked or checked on by the server. By the time we enquired about the delayed food (mains) we found out the kitchen hadn't even started preparing it, which lead us to promptly ask for our bill and leave to finish eating elsewhere before kitchens closed."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Harbord street forever after graduating from U of T and I thought it's still a small street with not much going on.   Turned out I was wrong. In the recent year this neighbourhood has got some really great restaurants. Rasa is one of them.   The restaurant is inside a house at a intersection. Looks like it's got a bit patio (for the summer). Once you get in you need to walk a few stairs down. I was instantly impressed with the vibe and the decor. It felt like an indie restaurant almost. Dim light but not so much. People are talking but not so loud. Busy but not packed. I loved it. The seats we got are two super super comfortable high chairs side by side facing the window by the street. Very intimate setting great for close friends or a date.   We ordered 5 dishes - chop salad, octopus, braised lamb, duck breast and sticky bun. All of them came out really great. You can tell thoughts were put into the presentation, texture, and the taste. The sticky bun and the duck breast were especially incredible. The braised lamb very unique with a Persian touch. The octopus was tender and flavourful.   There were only two of us and we ordered 5 dishes because usually portions at tapas restaurants are small but this is not the case for Rasa. The portion is quite decent and we got so full! The bill wasn't exactly cheap or expensive but it think it's worth it and of great value."}
{"text":"What can I say about Rasa.. besides that our whole night was exceptional! From walking into the restaurant we felt such a warm welcome and greeting from the hostess/host and manager. Although we did not have a reservation, we were luckily accommodated for a table for 2 and was immediately served water (water service is crucial always!) The style of Rasa is very tapas.. everything they make is smaller in portion size but nice to try multiple items and share with your party. We were so eager to try their menu and was provided great advice from the manager and our server... a Must is the chopped salad. It is not anything like a regular salad, has a great flavour and spice to it with the use of fried chick peas, feta cheese, kale, quinoa and other veg. Very refreshing and light tasting.   We also tried the fish sampler, and it came with 3 different types... one was similar to a banh mi style shrimp toast with hoison sauce and green onions.. was very tasty, warm and delicious! Prob my favourite out of the 3 different types.. my husband really enjoyed the ceviche as it was flavoured and seasoned with pepper chilli oil, chives and peanut butter. The flavours were so intense and they actually jive so well! The third sampler we got was a red tuna and it was good but not memorable as the other two.  We also got the burger since everyone has bene raving it is the best burger out there! It was delicious from the bun to the meat to the toppings... everything is made in house (even the burger bun!!) and it tasted juicy, meaty and had all the write toppings all together. This dish came with some home made root chips which was nice!  Lastly, we ordered this truffle mushroom gnocchi style dish (don't remember the exact name..) but it was to die for!!!!! My favorite dish of the entire night. The gnocchi itself was super fluffy and super truffle tasting which i loved. It was also so nicely presented!!! Love love this dish and could go for some more.  For dessert we got the sticky bun, it was good.. but i think next time we will try the lava cake instead. The sticky bun is huge though so can definitely share with 3 or 4 people after such a great meal.  But i must condemn the staff at Rasa. Impeccable service, never felt out of place and was always taken care of. Thank you Rasa staff for making our meal so enjoyable!!"}
{"text":"What a great find! Had the chopped salad, gnocchi, burger and chicken (not all by myself of course. At Rasa they encourage sharing/family style). We topped it all off with the sweet bun. Everything was delicious (especially the gnocchi) and the wait staff were all extremely nice. The only downside was it was a little noisy, but they weren't playing music so you could still hear. I'll definitely be back! Perhaps next time even with a very special guest (my grandma grew up on Robert St in the 1930s. Not sure how she'll feel about her old neighbourhood being super trendy and the meal costing more than her parents' monthly salary, but I know she'll love the food)."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to come here, after hearing so many rave reviews. I've been to the Food Dudes catering takeout in Leslieville, and loved it - I got the same experience here.   Thursday night, it was busy. The place is small but takes reservations.  Dishes are meant to share, which would have been the way we like to eat our meals anyway, and try more. Value to portion size was a little pricey. $9 for an appetizer, but with only 4 bites to share with 4 people, seems like very little.   Among the 4 of us, we had 1 appetizer and 4 mains and 2 desserts. I was stuffed, but that could be my small pregnant stomach talking. The guys seems okay too, but stuffed like me.   We started with the complimentary Pumpkin Spice Muffin. 3 little mini muffins that was moist and pumpkiny. We also got the CAULIFLOWER FRITTERS. Fried, and came on top of some salad that was really tasty. A common theme with all the dishes was subtle tastes that seem to all go together when you put it in your mouth.   CHEESE STEAK - Beef Tongue Sandwich. YUM. Melted cheese with soft beef tongue (not chewy) and some sauce. Came with some potato chips which wasn't so good.   DUCK BREAST - not as flavourful as I would have liked, and a little dry. Polenta with Kale salad side was good. Be wary, when I say side, it's more like a garnish.   GRILLED OCTOPUS with Pork Belly - this was my favourite. The idea is to eat a bit of the slaw, pork belly and octopus in one bite. There was some sweetness from the slaw, savoury from the pork belly, and octopus flavour. Yum.   BEEF CHEEK RAGU - yummy beef cheek,with bits of bacon. It wasn't my favourite, but it was good.   Dessert, we had the sweet plate which changes everyday. When she described it to be a sweet potato pudding, with black meringue and mashmellow, I thought a big plate with all three things on it. Instead, it was a small dish, again, put all the flavours in your mouth and let your palette take over. It was EXCELLENT, surprisingly. We also got the sticky bun. LIke a big walnut cinnamon bun, hold the cinnamon. With Cream Cheese Anglaise and Candied Bacon. Put it all together, and another creation in your mouth.   Overall with drinks it was $40-50 pp including tax and tip.   They will also start serving brunch. The menu adds some breakfast items like a really good eggs benedict, but also includes some dishes from the regular menu like the cheese steak.   I really enjoyed the restaurant, but may not come back in the near future unless the menu changes. For brunch, its another story.  Free parking on Robert St after 7pm and on weekends."}
{"text":"November 5, 2015  While we genuinely liked Rasa during our first visit (see review below) we were not blown away. This past weekend I returned with my parents from brunch and were thoroughly impressed.   My dad said that the chopped salad was one of the best salads he had ever had.  The maple bacon was insanely good. And the jam was delicious - you could eat it with a spoon if you were so inclined.   We will definitely be going back.   Original review - April 2015:  We went to Rasa on a Monday when they serve their set menu for a double birthday.   All of the food was tasty and the burger was particularly good.   The live music was a little loud but a nice touch.   Our server had a good sense of humour.  We were a bit annoyed thinking that dessert was included in the set menu, which it was not, but the $5 drinks were appreciated at a nicer place downtown.   All in all, this may not be my favourite destination, but it is certainly worth a visit."}
{"text":"First time here , i feel very welcome since i enter the   Front door. I order the hamburger who was exquisite"}
{"text":"We tried \"The Experience\" (their $60 tasting menu), and even without the food, the venue delivers that. The space is beautiful (intimate, not pretentious at all), the waiters are courteous without hovering over your table every couple of minutes, and your water glass is always full. The cocktail list is reasonably priced (~$13) and beautifully executed, based on the ones we tried. We sat inside, but there is a patio option as well. On the Thursday night we were here, the crowd was an interesting mix of students (given the proximity to University of Toronto) and upscale local couples / families.  Regarding the tasting menu, do note that almost all of the dishes were served family style, so get comfortable sharing! At first, it admittedly took a while to get our opening courses, which included a little pastry puff amuse bouche, the Chopped Salad and the Pastrami fish board. All of the food was absolutely delicious (seriously), but at this point, we were scraping the kale off the bottom of the salad bowl from hunger.   Shortly after, the kitchen seemed to have picked up momentum, and we were getting dish after dish. In no particular order: Spiducci (delicious lamb skewer), the Mushroom Gundi (very rich, with truffle oil), the Brussel Sprouts (nice kick of heat), the Burger (apparently rated as the third best in the city by Toronto Life, according to the waiters) and the Bangkok Bowl (tuna and calamari on a mango slaw). The desert was the soft serve cereal dish.  Across all of these dishes, the only ones which were underwhelming were the Burger and the dessert. Everything else, I would have happily ordered again. Thankfully, we turned out to be overwhelmed by the amount of food, and dinner no longer felt like The Hunger Games a couple dishes in. The waiter actually offered to pack up the last savoury course for us. On an aside, this is around the same time the couple beside us grabbed their bill... And Rasa gave them a $50 gift card to commemorate their anniversary, which they were celebrating there!   Lovely food, lovely people, lovely space, would definitely book again, especially for any anniversaries... ;)"}
{"text":"Service is friendly and patio is nice. We had the burger, chopped salad, spiducci, sticky bun and dessert of the day and they were all incredible!"}
{"text":"Shout out to the awesome staff and especially the bartenders. Very busy during dinner time. Be sure to book ahead of time. I got 'The Experience' which is the five course tasting menu. I liked the tuna a lot. Also their cocktail menu drinks are named after the cooks! Really neat! I recommend Declan. A bit on the pricier side but wouldn't complain."}
{"text":"Had a great night at Rasa. The service was awesome and the food delicious. Loved the Bangkok Bowl and sticky bun (sounds a bit odd but super yummy!). The ambiance is friendly and comfortable. It also happened to be my partner's birthday and the Rasa team went out of there way to make it a great experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch, very small space and they put a lotttt of tables there, so place became very pack and barely any room to walk. Food was ok(we ordered chicken waffle benny & ricotta scramble). Service was lacking, do not think they have enough servers for such a busy place."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service, amazing experience! Eat here and be spoiled for any other...  Arrived without a reservation when another restaurant on Harbord was too precious to accept reservations or accommodate parties arriving a different times... Scored a 4-seater on the patio on a lovely August night (late review - sorry!) Since this visit, we've tried to get a last minute reservation, but unfortunately, they've been full. So better book long ahead!  Service was very friendly and team-oriented, so we had 3 different people take care of us and all of them were excellent. The recommendations were spot on and all four of us LOVED our drinks and food.  The Chopped Salad was a favourite - so interesting, creative, and tasty. The Fish Board (3 types of fish) was incredible! LOVED it!  The part we loved the most was how the team felt we had waited too long for our mains - not that we noticed as we were busy in conversation. But they still decided to provide free desserts and gift cards for a return visit. Waaaay over the top on experience. Nothing I've ever experienced before and likely never will again."}
{"text":"Wow!   This was my first time at Rasa Bar and my first experience was amazing to say the least.   A few things that really impressed me about this spot was that the actual design of the restaurant is super trendy, the food is exquisite and different, and the servers have extensive knowledge of their menu.   The food portions are a little small for the price, however, this is a place I am willing to splurge on because the food is to die for.   My table and I got the Chopped Salad and the Brussel Sprouts for our apps.  For my entrée, I got the Beef Cheek Burger, the gochujang mayo compliments the beer very nicely.   Definitely going to go back.  Can't wait,   Thanks, Kris"}
{"text":"Oh Rasa!  If you are trying to impress out-of-town visitors or to convince a job candidate to move to Toronto, Rasa will do the work for you.  The space is medium sized and perfectly lit for that glow. It is also not too loud, so it is possible to actually have a conversation.  I have had dinner here many times, and it has always been stellar. It is not on the cheap side, but it is not too expensive either, especially for the quality of food and execution. Favorites include the classic chopped salad and truffle gnudi, the ceviche and the lamb shank. Rasa can you please bring back the Bangkok bowl? A great team: our party ended up being two times the size of our reservation and they went above and beyond to accommodate us graciously (thank you Adam! thank you Maor!). They are also extremely kind and accommodating of dietary restrictions.  (PS: although the patio is lovely, my experience has been that they are more prone to forgetting about you and as there is less foot traffic, it is harder to catch waitstaff to remedy some slowdowns)."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Unforgivable.  Came here for Sunday brunch today at 12:30pm. We arrived at the front entrance where multiple staff members walked (and sometimes squeezed) past us, yet failed to acknowledge our presence. When we asked the woman at the hostess stand whether she worked there, she replied: \"not today\" and proceeded to seat herself (!) and her male companion at a table. We then asked another woman what the situation was with seating. She was visibly annoyed and made a snarky and sarcastic comment about having to clean some tables, again without any indication of whether or when we would be seated. We continued to wait at the podium until we concluded that Rasa did not deserve our business.  Shocking behaviour. Will never come here again."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is a 5 star. From the food to the atmosphere and especially the serving staff. Some of the best food I've had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Best meal bucket for sure. I'm a tourist in Toronto and this place is totally walkable from the ROM/University of Toronto. It's a must do.  Don't miss it and trade in an amazing food journey at Rasa for a tourist trap advertised by a hotel concierge.   This is the place to go. And my kids loved it too.  I have no food pictures because we inhaled it all while giving each other meaningful looks.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We dined at Rasa last Saturday.  WE LOVED IT!  The food was delicious. Interesting, well prepared, flavourful.  This was our first visit to Rasa. Our server Jason directed us to some of his favourite dishes...we often asked the servers their opinions and sometimes leave the ordering to them. Jason didn't steer us wrong. He advised that the dishes were family style so best to share. We had the chopped (quinoa) salad, brussel sprouts (oh my), branzino (one of our favourite dishes ever - the lima beans were so good), and the burger (a friend recommended and Jason concurred). So so good.   The bartender made great martinis (okay, Cosmpolitans so only pretend martinis but they were good).  The servers were all friendly and fun. Jason was awesome. The atmosphere is casual and fun. The food was on par with any upscale restaurant in the city.   Our only negative was we were seated beside a particularly loud table.  That can't be helped.  It's a smallish dining room so it can be a little loud.  Absolutely recommend. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing, a must go to. Simple menu, awesome dishes and so much flavor! My husband and I ate here. We ordered 4 dishes plus dessert and it was plenty. Highly recommend the chopped salad, octopus, mushroom and burger dishes. Sticky bun for dessert is a must try. Atmosphere was great and every staff member so friendly. Don't miss out, check this place out if you're in town. This is what restaurants should be. Bam! PS - my hubby recommends the Malbec."}
{"text":"One of the rare, true five star dining experiences I've had in the city. Aside from a slight mixup with the reservation, the evening couldn't have gone smoother. We had family in from out of town and we wanted to take them somewhere special...Rasa fit the bill perfectly....AND they were fully able to accommodate a Celiac (me.)  I enjoyed everything I tried but can't speak highly enough about the sous vide pork chop. Perfectly cooked from end to end and topped with crackling (and crispy pig ear) it was very delicious.  The cocktails were excellent and I like the BYOB option (we partook in a few bottles from my family winery.)  From start to finish it was a great evening and I strongly recommend you stop by Rasa for a meal"}
{"text":"My wife and I hit RASA this past weekend (Date Night) and we tried \"The Experience\" which is like a tasting money (sort of) it's more like a greatest hits from their menu but in smaller form so that you can eat more. One of the owners was there and he sommelier'd for us and paired wine by the glass with each course. It was an excellent night. We had lame spudinni, bangok bowl with fresh tuna and calamari, the tastiest cauliflower dish with an amazing habanero vinegar, oh and their purge with kimchi and gojuchan - off the charts tasty. The wine pairings were spot on and the vibe of the place is infectious and the wrap around patio is great."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to dining at Rasa for about a month now since friends of mine described having a great experience here (as did fellow Yelpers). The restaurant has a cozy feel with rustic distressed wooden tables and wall panels, galvanized metal chairs, eclectic artwork composed of pipes and lightbulbs, and chalkboard looking artwork on the ceilings. The menu is limited but there are certainly lots of options for everyone. The server mentioned that dishes are intended to be served family style and shared, but certainly individuals could order their own dishes if preferred.  Our server started us off with an amuse bouche consisting of panko-crusted farro arancini with a creamy red sauce. This was very tasty and a reflection of the delicious dishes to come.   My friends and I couldn't decide upon one appetizer, so we shared the chopped salad and the Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts were like nothing I've ever had before. They were roasted to the point of achieving beautiful caramelized edges and were served with a delicious cauliflower cheese sauce that brought this lowly vegetable to sublime status. I could easily have eaten several servings of the sprouts. The chopped salad was composed of parsley, peppers, kale, quinoa, grape tomatoes, red grapes, crunchy roasted Harissa chickpeas, and cucumber, and was beautifully plated with a jalapeño feta \"schmear\". I could have honestly eaten a whole serving of the chopped salad by myself as the combination of flavours and textures was so well balanced and refreshing.   A friend and I each ordered the short rib entree ($29). I must admit that I am a sucker for short ribs, which acquire a melt in your mouth texture and a lot of flavour when cooked the right way.  It was served with crunchy chicharon pieces made of beef tendon (think texture of pork rinds), perfectly crusted roast potatoes, pickled red onions, and a couple of delicious sauces including a yuzu bbq sauce. The beef was flavourful with a beautiful smokiness reminiscent of barbecued ribs but with a more tender texture. Upon taking our first bites of our short rib, my friend and I looked at one another and nodded, both in complete agreement that we had chosen our entree well.   One of my friends ordered the burger ($17) with provolone, gochujang (Korean condiment), and bean sprout kimchi (suggested serving: medium rare because of the higher quality of meat). This came with a side of taro chips. My other friend ordered the lamb spiducci (skewers) ($18) which came with haloumi cheese, labneh, pomegranate seeds and pine nut gremolata. Both of these dishes looked and smelled fantastic. In fact, every dish served to us throughout the meal was artfully plated and was a feast for both the eyes and the palate. Each dish certainly surpassed our expectations.  For dessert, we shared \"the cereal\", which is like a plated sundae with cereal ice cream, milk pudding, granola-like crunchy topping, dehydrated banana slices, and delicious disks of dark chocolate ganache. I personally don't think the dehydrated banana slices brought anything to this dessert. This was certainly a fun dessert to try and I enjoyed the contrasting textures between the milk pudding, ice cream, and the cereal topping.   Because we couldn't decide on one dessert, we also shared the sticky bun, which was like a warm comforting hug of soft caramelized topping and crunchy pecan goodness. I appreciated that the sticky bun really wasn't overly sweet but I'd definitely suggest this as a dessert that should be shared (or face certain hyperglycaemia). Oh did I mention it comes with 2 strips of caramelized bacon?  They offer a tasting menu for $60 per person which is called \"the experience\". If you are quite hungry and want to try out many of the menu offerings, the tasting menu might be the way to go. They also have a patio which would be great for dining out on during warmer weather.  For $185 including tip for 4 people for 4 entrees, 2 appetizers, and 2 desserts, the food was well worth the price. 4.5 stars for the fantastic service, great atmosphere, and superb food offerings. I definitely plan to come back, both with friends and with my hubby!  (55/100)"}
{"text":"Four of us enjoyed dinner here last Thursday evening. Our server was very friendly and around when we needed her, which was nice. The atmosphere and vibe is very cool. We ordered five items to share and everything was very tasty. The wagyu beef was particularly memorable. 5 plates for four persons is more than adequate. We polished off everything!  Sadly, they were out of the famous sticky buns. We'll have to return the next time we visit Toronto.  Service: 5 stars Ambiance: 4.5 stars Cuisine: 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Truly a fantastic restaurant. Have been back twice since my first visit. High quality customer service makes the experience even better. Only wish there were more vegetarian options so I could go back every week!"}
{"text":"Just ate here an hour ago.  Ordered the following: Po Boy Biscuit Fried Cauliflower Duck Fish Board  First off, gracious host and very polite and caring. Ambiance is fantastic. Not too loud and not too quiet; great to go for a date.  Ok. So the food. I am reading all the review and people are blown away by the food. The food was good but it wasn't amazing. I sound like a harsh critic but I am comparing this to other gastro/tapas/food experiences I've had in Toronto and around the world. The Po boy was a bit dry and lacked some sauce. The biscuit was nice. The cauliflower fritters were good but the marinated cauliflowers were off and the plate used was a bit too large for the dish. Duck was well cooked and the foie gras sprinkles were nice but the green salad was a bit too bitter. The fish board was very nice and gave new flavors.  Pricing very reasonable of 50pp. Should you go here? Yes. Try it out, it is nice. Is there room for improvement? Of course. With some menu tweaks this place has the potential to really shine."}
{"text":"Great patio, good food and nice service. It was delightful to get a surprise treat from the chef. A place to remember and come back to."}
{"text":"What a lovely gem!  I had heard wonderful things about Rasa and got my chance to test it out last Monday.  Monday is industry night, which involves live music, $5 wine pours and a set menu.    The complementary amuse bouche was house made corn chips in a black bean dip/puree, sprinkled with malt vinegar dust.  Looks like nothing special but it was so delicious and a great start to the meal.  The salad came next.  The infamous chopped salad.  OMG, I want to eat this all the time.  Kale (not too much, which is good b/c....kale, gross), quinoa, chopped veg, crunchy chickpeas.  The star was the jalapeño dressing with lots of Macedonian feta.  Simple but so delicious.  For the appetizer I chose the smashed potato.  I have no recollection what it involved, b/c I was in a complete trance.  There was spicy, and creamy, and there may have been cheese.  Fantastic.    For the main, I ordered the truffle gnudi.  My friend was a bit WTF at me b/c I don't actually love mushrooms.  BUT, in my own defence, I love mushroom flavour, and figured, if there is ever a time to experiment with eating mushroom chunks, it's probably at a place like this.  I really enjoyed the hen of the woods and the pickled mushrooms, but wasn't a big fan of the portobellos.  No biggie, the rest of the dish was delicious and exciting.  For dessert, the restaurant offers a sweet treat as part of the set menu.  I elected to order a bourbon caramel donut.  I certainly didn't need it, but the food was so good that I figured, why stop now?  It was delicious but not mind-blowing.  I'm more of a potato person anyway.    My bill was a thrifty $75, even with 3 glasses of wine.  The music was enjoyable but not intrusive.  The owner (I think?  Adam?) came over a couple of times and was really nice.  The hostess and all of the waitstaff were friendly and charming.  No stuffy hipsters here.  The whole vibe of the place was great.  Robert street has free parking.  What more do you want, yelpers?  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"We went for a date earlier this evening to Rasa. Our server was very friendly and helpful, making sure to ask if we had any allergies before we ordered.  We got a couple drinks, three sharing plates, and two desserts. Everything was delicious, and we had to refrain from ordering more!  The service was efficient, but not rushed, and they paced the delivery of the plates which meant you weren't overwhelmed with food all at once. We sat on the patio, with a view of Harbord Street, but you can also sit indoors.  Throughout the meal, both of us were saying \"we should come again\", and definitely will!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: 4/5  Service:5/5  Food:3.5/5   My party of 3 arrived at 5:30 as it was one of the only slots left for Monday night's set menu, we got a beautiful table by the window, which I personally thought was the best seat in the house. The servers were quick and charming to ensure that we knew the menu and had drinks.   The snack was salt and vinegar popcorn, which wasn't too special, but for a snack it's flavourful enough.  Then came the chop salad, which was incredible the ingredients will continue to surprise you, grapes, cucumbers, crispy chickpeas... It was one of the best courses  Then we tried all 3 of the appetizer choices, the Po boy, chicken wings, and veggie slate. I heard the Po boy was amazing( the guac was ) and I had the veggie slate, which was so well prepared and seasoned. I had no idea what veggies I was eating but they were fantastic.   For mains, we got the burger and Bangkok bowl.  I for one did not enjoy the burger, I thought the beef cheek took away from the chewiness of a burger patty, the mushiness of the beef cheek turned me away from the dish. My friend liked the Bangkok bowl, though it could have used a bit more flavor.   Sweet surprise was the Turtles fudge brownies. Amazing, best part of the meal!   The jazz band started playing as we left, overall pretty good tasting menu!"}
{"text":"Just when I feel Toronto is running out of fresh ideas a place like Rasa comes along. Totally authentic and original. A refreshing addition to the Harbord Room dominated strip.   We walked in at 8 on a sat. We were welcomed and they made a table work. So refreshing not to get the edgy hostess treatment. Staff is bright, breezy and mostly women, including in the kitchen and behind the bar. Space is cool and industrial but a nice departure from the 'unfinished' 'didn't bother' look so prevalent lately.  Loved the sunken basement vibe, open kitchen, heavy wood tables, polished cement floors.  Music was loud, energy high and the crowd very Annex sporting mostly black & grey.   The menu is creative and fresh.  We struggled to decided. In the end we opted for: chopped salad = amazing, do not miss; poppers = my perfect flavour mix; soup = creative, rich; toast with meatball = pretty good; sticky bun = heavenly. Not a single miss. All were interesting, tasty and felt new.   We will go back soon. Maybe with a bigger group or maybe to sit at the chef's table.  Am dying to try the fish and the steak so next time we will come super hungry.   You should check it out."}
{"text":"The Food Dudes have done it again!!  Came here tonight for their soft opening and damnnnn you better check this place out before it gets huge.  It's been named one of the most anticipated restos opening this summer and I definitely see why, their food is fun, tasty, and innovative.  Paired with some stellar (and stiff) drinks created by Chanel Wood and some wicked desserts by the pastry chef (I believe her name is Olivia), you're going to be spoiled.    Not to mention their servers were on point from start to end.  I've said this many times, I'm a keener for great service and they were definitely on their A game.  Harbord Village is already becoming a hot spot for restaurants but with the addition of Rasa, this is going to be the new dining destination this summer.    I encourage you to go now while you can, it's going to BOOM real soon. Their patio opens next week which will open up another 5 or 6 tables."}
{"text":"Fresh, creative dishes that aren't over worked. The staff are also quite nice. Very casual dinning room."}
{"text":"The food at Rasa is totally spectacular. I'm celiac and was worried I couldn't eat much on the menu, but knowing they participated in Gluten Freedom Week I figured they might be knowledgeable. I left full, so satisfied and so happy. The vegan platter -sounds kinda lame, is totally unreal, I could never make such beautiful and delicious vegetables, the chopped salad is insanely good (for real, I'd probably eat it everyday to be honest) and the fish platter, equally gorgeous and delicious. The patio is going to be a real asset in the summer, the place is pretty unmissable -especially if you CAN eat gluten, there were so many things I was envious of!"}
{"text":"What a great new place. Went here for a birthday dinner on Monday night, and enjoyed the $35 prix fixe dinner with $5 drinks. The ambiance was great - there was amazing live music, staff were friendly and unpretentious. We started with the chopped salad which was AMAZING. I also had the dumplings, which were served with fresh broth poured over top. My main was the Bangkok Bowl, a delicious medley of calamari, yellowfin tuna encrusted with black sesame, and an asian slaw. Even my $5 red wine was delicious. The only (slight) disappointment was the dessert - it sounded great in theory (chocolate chip waffle with mint ice cream) but just wasn't as decadent as I would have liked. Nevertheless it was a fantastic dinner and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"best little cozy spot in Harbord Village. was introduced by a girlfriend, one of the best salads in Toronto, their chopped salad. one may think, that's being overdramatic, but i problem you it's very very satisfying. it has the perfect ingredients to make eating a salad SO exciting, the perfect texture (my fav. being their chickpeas) and the jalapeño spread on the side. we also had their famous chocolate cake, gluten free! it's the perfect amount to share and rid yourself of any sweet tooth cravings. their vanilla ice cream pairs with it perfectly, with torched marshmallow, topping it all off. their menu is very unique, from plating to serving, the servers tell you the exact ingredients in each dish. i think the prices are reasonable for Toronto, but it's the service that makes it outstanding. service the first time, fantastic, can't remember his name but he was hilarious.   my second time, i took my sister here for her birthday. we called ahead to see if they could accommodate us, luckily they had the chef's rail available, which we didn't mind at all. i got the salad but of course, and she tried their burger. she loved it, perfectly cooked at a medium rare, the sauce was delicious - it was served with homemade taro chips. she was so happy and said she can't wait to come back. and of course we had the cake. great meal as expected.   my third visit here, was by far the best. i had made a reservation but when we arrived (already 15 minutes late), the table wasn't ready. i looked around and saw maybe a table available but didn't say anything. the hostess had remembered me from a previous time when i tried to come by for the dessert (put it was full), which i was vey impressed with. we sat waiting at the bar and went ahead to order our entrées while waiting. my friend ordered the burger and i couldn't decide, so stayed loyal to the salad. yes i really enjoy it that much. food came before our table was ready so we just stayed there. a gentleman came by later to check in, i recognized him from previous times. he proceeded to apologize for not having a table ready. he proceeded to comp our entrées. it was extremely nice of him, especially when i didn't complain or even utter a noise about any of it. in addition to that, because their menus changed for the season, the cake was no longer there! i did nag about it being my go to, he asked the kitchen to prepare the new dessert, IN ADDITION, asked them to bring out a slice of the cake. i was so happy, he made my night - couldn't believe how hospitable he was!   needless to say, it's one of my favourite restos in Toronto. i know thus is an essay but note: when making reservations, i love that you're able to text them! once you're in their system, you will never be asked for your name and number again. the fact that he went above and beyond to show appreciation for his customers, it was extraordinary (later found out he, is the manager/co-owner). you do not find that of customer service around anymore, trust me, i've dined at some of Toronto's top restaurants. i will always be coming back to Rasa! highly recommend, you must come here if you haven't already!  i have yet had drinks here but their cocktails look great - also looking forward to trying their tasting menu!"}
{"text":"Jeezus f'n xrist...the ceviche made me weep...which is why we ordered a second order of the dish. It was our last night in Toronto so the pressure was on to find an amazing place for dinner. Not sure how we found Rasa but it was the treasure that we were looking for. It almost didn't happen...it was \"industry night\" (whatever that meant) so the place was expected to be crowded. We were glad to score a table and were happy to play along with the prix fixe menu that we were given. I've already glorified the ceviche but the pasta and everything else that we ate were equally stupendous! Service was fantastic and the live music was fun (if you don't like live music, choose a different night). Since we've been home, We've already been lauding the merits of this place to our friends who frequently visit Toronto. A definite must-go-to!"}
{"text":"The food really was really really great.  The gnudi and the chopped salad were major highlights.  The service seems a bit dissorganized - we seemed to have several waiters, maybe if they just had the same servers doing the same tables the whole time it would work better.  Will definitely be back though!"}
{"text":"If you're looking to go for a great meal and don't mind spending ~$65 a person (drinks not included), then Rasa would rank near the top of my list. Go for The Experience. Also, this place is rather small, so keep your party size to no more than 6 or else it's going to be difficult unless you make reservations in advance.  I would strongly recommend going for at least 1 of each of their courses. (Appetizer, Entree, dessert). They do have a fried donut for $5, but we were full by the end of it, so we didn't get it.  The chopped salad has received rave reviews from other people and I'd like to chime in that if there was a salad that I could go eat on a daily basis, this would be it (no becoming vegetarian thoughts yet). The chickpeas were a nice addition and the portion size was good. It was well-balanced and you can taste the fresh and the crunch with each bite. On a preference issue, it was somewhat hard to get the salad from the big bowl (presentation = beautiful btw) with a fork and then eat from the plate with the fork. I would have liked to use chopsticks. There was also a bacon dish that I probably should've taken, but I had salad.  I had the burger for a main dish and my partner had the albacore tuna dish. Burger was smaller than I thought it would be, but was more filling than I expected. The burger meat was...so soft and juicy. I can still salivate on that memory even though I just ate lunch. The albacore tuna dish was tasty (of the small portion that I had).   The dessert was a chocolate mousse. I would say that this was probably not the most satisfying way to end the meal, simply because it was the size of a chocolate truffle. To be perfectly fair, it was way better than any truffle I've tasted because it was so soft, smooth and creamy. It also helped that it simply melted instantly in your mouth.  All in all, great meal. The ambiance inside the restaurant was great, not too loud or too soft, and the live music was a nice romantic touch. I couldn't figure out the beat because I suck, but my partner could, and that's all that mattered. Service was good and not overbearing. I did like the waiters' accents, they were cool.  Service: 5/5 Food: 5/5 Price Point: 4.5/5 (I feel that it's still a tad too pricey, but everything was a bullseye)  Overall: 5/5   Note: They do NOT open on saturdays for brunch (they open at 5:30PM). Only sundays do they have brunch. I had the misfortune of not checking the times properly and only realized that i dun goofed once I was outside the restaurant, on a saturday morning all hungry. Please be open Saturdays!"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in the city! Delicious food and great service.   Come on Monday nights for the Prix fixe."}
{"text":"I have never written a review before but my experiences at Rasa have been so incredible that I feel compelled to do so.   Food: I have tried all the food on the menu (although I do have to say, other than a few favourites, I did notice that they change up their menu often enough) and it's all amazing but I especially love their burger which is done perfectly with a super tasty sauce, toppings and a brioche bun that all go so well together (it was voted one of the top burgers in Toronto and definitely lives up to the title). The Bangkok Bowl is also one of my favourites, again with the tuna cooked perfectly, crispy calamari and bright mango jicama slaw. The chopped salad (also voted one of the top chopped salads in Toronto) has amazing crunch with the crispy chickpeas and great flavours. It was so delicious, my friend was actually scrapping the side of the bowl with her finger to get any remaining dressing. But seriously, they know how to make good food here and you really can't go wrong with any of items on the menu.   Ambiance: I love how inside it's really beautifully done but feels cozy and comfortable at the same time. The small space and open kitchen gives it an intimate feeling. They have a great wrap around patio outside as well. I also like how it's not douchey our sceney here. And Monday nights they have live music, which is a bonus to their $40 set menu and $5 drinks!  Service: I can't say enough good things about the service. They really go above and beyond. Everyone, from the servers to the hostess to the bartenders to the managers to the cooks are all so incredibly nice, friendly and on point with the service. I have to say that Tess, on the management team, and Moar, one of the servers, are incredible and make you feel like family there (but not in an uncomfortable, over the top way). I also really like how last night, when part of my party was an hour behind the rest of us, they didn't rush us to order even though the place was full. And then when my party unexpectedly turned out to be too large for where we were seated (I had booked our reservation at the Chef's Bar because that was all that was available at the time of booking), the manager was so accommodating and moved us to a table when it became available.   I took a break from going to Rasa about a year ago just because I had gone so much the year before that I felt like I should try other places, but after going again last night for my birthday, I don't know why I ever stopped. The incredible experience made me want to keep going back there again and I would like to share this hidden gem with everyone. There are a lot of great restaurants in Toronto but Rasa consistently over delivers in every category. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't usually come to this area but I heard good things about Rasa and decided to check it out. The restaurant has quite a lot of outdoor seating, may be even more than the inside. I came without reservations and there wasn't a wait. I sat inside and the atmosphere was very cozy. It wasn't loud at all.   Service: The server was friendly and welcoming. He explained the menu to me and my friend. He also made recommendations of his personal favorites. Our server was also very attentive and checked up on us frequently.   Food:  Chopped salad: this was their top menu item so of course I had to order it. It was well tossed and it had a bunch of everything. The jalapeño cheese sauce on the side of the peel was really delicious. I'll definitely order this again if I return.   Octopus: the octopus dish was good. But it wasn't outstanding to me. The sauce was nice, it was very bold in flavor.   Shrimp: the shrimp dish was good as well but nothing blew my mind.    Overall I had a nice experience at rasa. The service and food was great. I may return to try the tasting menu."}
{"text":"Been to Rasa several times for dinner and I've always really enjoyed it. This past weekend, I decided to try out their brunch.  The brunch menu is fairly limited. We were given some small cheddar and chive biscuits as an amuse bouche, which was much appreciated. The biscuits were buttery and fluffy. For the main, I got the hash - which came with a bed of root vegetables, topped with 2 perfectly poached eggs, sauerkraut, and creme fraiche. The dish was well done, but I felt the portion was a bit small given the price ($14). Wish it included a side of toast or some other protein, such as bacon or sausage (they can be ordered separately, though).   The weekly donut ($4) was a simple fried donut with scotch and chamomile glaze, as well as a graham cracker and oatmeal crumble. It was warm, squishy, and delicious - a perfect ending to brunch.  We sat at the bar right in front of the open kitchen, and the two cooks made some small talk and told us about the dishes, which was nice. Service was friendly, but a bit spotty at a times. I don't know that I would necessarily return for brunch, but I would highly recommend the dinner."}
{"text":"My Saturday night at Rasa was definitely a memorable one. Firstly, they have a great cocktail list (which is a huge plus for me, especially on a Saturday night), I enjoyed both of the cocktails I had. We had the chopped salad and truffle gnudi to start. The chopped salad was so tasty and refreshing, I loved the crunch of the chickpeas as well. The truffle gnudi was delicious and rich. For our mains, I had the burger and my boyfriend had the duck breast. My burger was amazing. One of the best burgers I've ever had, if not the best. It was the juiciest burger I've ever had and the flavours were absolutely delicious. My boyfriend's duck breast was amazing as well. The duck was perfectly cooked and the grains and sauce accompanying it were delicious. We had the chocolate molten cake for dessert which was absolutely mind blowing. My boyfriend and I salivate just thinking about it. The flavours and textures were just perfect. Service was great as well, it was friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. Overall, I had an amazing experience at Rasa and would love to return. So glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"I am not sure how I ended up here. I've been on a 2 week long dining out binge and I am starting to lose it a little or a lot actually. But then the reviews from fellow Yelpers drew me in because I am a sucker just like you who is reading this. =P  The evening was perfect; perfect weather and ambiance with the perfect company. This is a hipster place; rustic and earthy in their approach. From the vintage lighting, saucy ceiling tiles to the rustic barnboards and planters this place oozes the chills and relaxation. The patio is where you should be.  This place serves fusion tapas that I would coin as Canadiana cuisine; food the embraces our diversity. We had the sampler (it was a promo with a local brewery) which consists of potstickers, arancini and a pork creation with XO sauce and black garlic. The potstickers were divine and one of the best I've had with it's paper thin wrapper and that deliciously warm and soupy filling. The arancini was crispy on the outside all the while crumbly as you bit into it; great texture. Last but not least the pork was just fantastic. Juicy, salty, briney and strong hints black garlic; absolutely perfect! We also ordered the brussel sprouts which is one of my favourites. The sprouts are cooked perfectly tender with a slight crisp and that exterior that reminds me of seaweed; slightly shriveled and dry with a toasty finish on the palette. Then that creamy, savoury cheesy sauce sets in and just takes it over the top. Last but not least came the sticky buns. Moist, airy, warm, loaded with walnuts and topped with candied bacon. Then they take it to the stratosphere with that cream cheese anglaise. No need to describe the taste, this was sinfully good.  I would rank Rasa as one of the best tapas places I've been to just nipping at the tails of some of the best out in the West Coast and the Motor City area. Fantastic ambiance, good service and excellent food. This is a must!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night for something small to eat and some beers. We were lucky enough to get a spot on the patio.  We got the Truffle Gnudi (5 stars, an amazing bust of earthy flavours) and the Pork Belly (3 stars, a little underwhelming and a bit bitter). Overall we had a pleasant evening. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh ingredients in a comfortable neighborhood setting. What's not to love?  The chicken and waffles benny was so eggcelent."}
{"text":"We greatly enjoyed a recent night at Rasa. Rasa is doing something special. It's tricky to put into words actually, but I'll start by saying it's a place I'd like to come back to regularly - and not because it's easy or predictable. Rasa's got personality, and a unique point of view. Rasa feels like a work in progress, and this a very, very positive thing. There is play happening here. There is growth. There are risks being made, chances being taken, and this often works very, very well. Rasa is engaging and surprising, and our meal here was both tasty and entertaining.   Dinner at Rasa starts with mini muffins rich in herbs and flavour. Two bite savoury wonders,  the muffins are a warm, comforting, supremely welcoming opening act.   Cocktails - Respectable bartending happening here. I loved their unique take on a mojito, and they do a great job with classics like an old fashioned also. Staff is super helpful, and can recommend wine or cocktails to pair with each dish, even dessert!  Service - Very happy with the service. Not too much, not in your face all night, able to answer all questions quickly and credibly. Simple. And owners very responsive! I'd made some comments about a previous off the mark brunch, owners responded quickly and respectfully. I was blown away.   Let's talk more about the food, these dishes were stand-outs:  Chopped Salad has a secret - jalapeno feta schmeared on the inside of the bowl beneath the veggie and quinoa salad, encouraging you to stir, play and scrape up a little creamy spicy goodness with every bite.  Crunchy harissa chick peas add an unexpected crunch and satisfying texture to the dish.  Brussel Sprouts - This dish was a huge hit with us. Absolutely an inventive preparation for Brussel sprouts, with a vinegary kick and again, satisfying texture for the win. I asked - the \"crispy onion\" on top is actually crispy shallots, which bring not only crunch and that onion-y kick, but also a defined, unmistakable sweetness. I could eat this every day of the week.  Shawarma Toast - Lamb neck was wonderfully flavourful and melt in your mouth tender. Love the pickled jicama accent too. Delicious.   Bangkok Bowl - Perfectly prepared tuna, with fresh, vibrant mango jicama slaw. But the star of this dish was the crispy fried squid. My fiancé (generally pescatarian, but with a strong \"no tentacles\" policy) was ready to fight me over the perfectly seasoned, crunchy yet tender fried squid in this dish. Yummmmm.  Truffle Gnudi - Sooo savoury, and the gnudi another masterpiece of texture. Just perfect.  Scallops in Oxtail Risotto - I love a scallop, and I love a risotto. This was heaven.   And for dessert, Cereal! Like the chopped salad, the schmeared chocolate ganache in the bowl makes this dish for me. I'm going to steal the schmear trick for cooking at home, it's that good.  Now let's think about this - you are looking at a menu that includes crunchy chick peas, brussel sprouts, lamb neck, tentacles, oxtail.  You may be thinking, but I don't like any of those things. Well, guess what, you owe it to yourself to go freaking try it, because these dishes are all FABULOUS. Just super yummy delicious. And FUN. And I think that's the point - go and eat! Try something new! Experiment and play and enjoy something different. With the diversity of the menu, you can easily stop in just for drinks and apps, or hang out for the whole night and do the pre fixe.  Rasa may not get it perfect every time, but they are really doing something interesting, and they may just change your thinking about these ingredients. I'm giving them mad respect for trying something new, and I can't wait to go back. Thanks Rasa for a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. The place is unpretentious. Everything coming out of the kitchen is top quality. I am not from Toronto, and maybe restaurants are held to a higher standard here in Toronto compared to Vancouver, but I was thoroughly impressed by how everything tasted.   I can't finish the review without also noting that our bartender was wonderful. She's experienced, has some of her own drinks on the menu, and made the whole night enjoyable. We were early, so we probably avoided some of the service/speed complaints I've read in other reviews.   This was a great find. I am grateful to my co-worker for showing me this place."}
{"text":"You need to eat here.  Throughout my 5 day trip I met a number of locals who feel the same. I like well-executed food, and I like a place that feels like home. I found it.   The Gush: Monday night they have a wonderfully priced tasting menu for $40 a person - and it will leave you so happy and full. The food is terrific. I wish I had a better word for it. They even offer house wine at $5 a glass! So incredibly respectable.   Atmosphere is so cozy and comfortable. Families, couples, everyone. And all so relaxed and happy.   Staff! Now they have GOT this. The staff work as a seamless team. From hostess, servers, cooks and even owners, they each go out of their way to make your experience polished but so friendly and unpretentious.   But the food. Every dish was insanely balanced and tasty. That popcorn. The salad! Omg the salad. The sea bream... I honestly can rave about EVERY dish (I just remembered the Brussel sprouts...WOW) I am so incredibly glad I came. Hands down my favourite food experience in Toronto.   Oh and they had a solo live guitar player/singer  who was very talented and the music fit the scene so well.   The only thing I wish was that I had tried the burger. The guy next to me sat down and ordered it immediately without even looking at a menu. It looked amazing.   Huge thanks to Adam and his team for making my night!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance, and had a pretty welcoming vibe. Our servers were very attentive in the beginning of our meal and were very helpful at explaining the menu. Most of the food was spectacular. Loved the lamb ribs, and the shrimp salad with a polenta purée with coconut milk that perfectly complimented the shrimp. The duck was overcooked and we couldn't finish it. The service wavered off near the end of our meal and we were left feeling a little ignored. Also the crowd got a little business district douchetacular - if you know what I mean.   All-in-all I'd say this is a good place to try out at least once. I probably won't go back, but the lamb ribs and the shrimp-polenta-salad will live on forever in my memory."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service!!   A couple of my friends and I were walking on Harbord more than TWO hours before a Jays game we planned to attend, and spotted Rasa. It looked as if it was an awesome place with rustic vibes so we decided to stop and grab a bite to eat.  Our waiter seated us and explained their $40 Monday special menu and how it worked. The food seemed very appetizing, so one friend and I ordered their $40 special and my other friend ordered a burger a la carte.   Our two appetizers were given to us very quickly, as well as my friends burger, however, the burger I ordered in my $40 special took AN HOUR to receive, and this was after my friends had received and ate their main courses. Now, I usually don't mind waiting for food, but it was the fact that our waiter kept making false excuses stating that they just finished my burger and it was on it's way.   20 minutes after the first excuse, he stated that it was coming in 5 minutes. Another 20 minutes after that he apologized and said they're \"finishing it up\" AND FINALLY after an hour had passed by he came by and said \"Sorry, the patty split in half so we're making you a new one,\" and he said this while LAUGHING.  As a customer service employee I found this very unprofessional and uncomfortable. If you knew my burger had split, then tell me from the beginning and don't try to make up excuses. The fact that he had also served two other tables main courses BEFORE mine and they all came to the restaurant more than an HOUR after us, really showcased their horrible service, (one table ordered a burger as well and received it before me).   We finally told him that we were running on a short schedule and we had to make it to a Jays game and he gave us so much sass for this.  We then paid for our bills and we had to REMIND him to give us our desserts that were INCLUDED in our $40 menu. (Which were very hard and seemingly old brownies, may I add).  It's safe to say that we were very late to the Jays game, and we will NOT be returning to this restaurant ever again. :)"}
{"text":"Hidden gem or not? Restaurants on Harbour St are in such a dilemma location, between Annex &  Kensington/Queen W.  You just don't come here too often. I am so glad I FINALLY tried Rasa after bookmarking it for so long...  Location/Decor: the address says Roberts St, it's door is actually on Harbor. Easy to find street parking, free after 9pm. Can also park on neighbourhood streets. It is very intimate vibe, exposed brick, exposed concrete, big wood beam, restored wood slab tables, leather high chair (my fav seat), big facing street window, cactus plants by the window. It's love at the first sight.   Food: they change menu every month? Or season? I'm not sure. But few classic items remain on the menu (such as chopped salad, sticky bun, octopus). Because it's tapa style so we (two girls) ordered five dishes (including dessert). We were too full after four dishes. First dish, chopped salad. I am not a salad person AT ALL. I usually skilled all salad dishes when dining out. But this salad is a MUST-TRY. Few chopped veggies, quinoa, grapes, toasted crunchy chickpeas, with jelapño spread. Second dish STICKY BUN, we had them serve dessert as second course because we were just too hungry and figured dessert won't take long to come. It's another must try item. Tastes like warm cinnamon bun with toasted walnut and applewood bacon! We also order duck breast, octopus, and braised lamb. All of them are 9/10 in terms of flavours, presentation, creativity.   I would come back!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A friend had his birthday dinner here and it was a great night. The service was friendly and prompt and the food was great. It was mostly small plates that were good for sharing. There wasn't a single dish I didn't enjoy. Loved the chopped salad and the baked octopus with pork belly, in particular."}
{"text":"This restaurant is location right on the corner of Harbord and Robert St, though the sign is a subtle and easily missed. Parking is a pain (street parking) before 7pm as you need a permit.   I came here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend and we were late due to parking. The servers were super nice about it. Originally, we had wanted to try the Rasa Experience, however, due to time constraints (there was another reservation for our table after us), we decided to order two appetizers and two entrees each and then share a dessert. We ordered the Smoked fish and chicken dumplings to start. Boy, these were delicious and perfectly seasoned. We loved the crunchy dumpling exterior and the lovely broth they poured on when they presented it at our table. The smoked fish was presented beautifully and paired well with the citrus fruit (mandarin, maybe?).   For the entrees, we ordered the Octopus and the Wagyu ribs, which was upgraded to flank for that night. I was not a fan of the octopus due to the mushy texture, but the pork belly and the slaw was great. The wagyu flank was seasoned well but was too tough. The entrees were seasoned well, but were disappointing compared to their appetizers.   Although we were full by the end of it, we ordered the Cereal dessert which turned out to be thoroughly satisfying. Both my boyfriend and I fought over who got the last spoon of the ice cream.  Service is great here, even if the food is a little slow. However, I had no complaints as each dish was presented beautifully and tasted great."}
{"text":"Picked this place randomly off of Yelp and was very happy with my choice. We didn't have reservations and was still sat within 10 minutes. They feature a prix-fixe menu on Mondays that you can choose from. My choices started off with an amuse bouche of a smoked trout, followed by a chopped salad, shrimp Po' Boy, their amazing burger and fudge dessert. I added the doughnut because... I had, that's why. Lol. Everything was INCREDIBLE. I've eaten at restaurants that have $150.00 prix-fixe menus and I would STILL rather eat here. That's how good the food was. The service was amazing as well. I'll definitely come here again. (See pictures.)"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise.   Met a friend here for drinks on a Monday night ($5 wines!), not really knowing what to expect. The interior space is, for lack of a better term, classy but without feeling stuffy or pretentious. After ordering our drinks, the waiter kindly brought us out to the patio once space became available. For my money, it's one of the best on Harbord Street.   We shared the chopped salad, truffle gnudi, and salted caramel donut. Everything was elegantly presented and delicious.   Really glad I found this place. Will most definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the Harbord Village neighborhood, near the University. You descend a few stairs to enter the establishment which gives is a rathskeller aesthetic.  All tables were filled, so I ate at the bar.  Very interesting and eclectic menu, and the food was very good."}
{"text":"One of the best places I've eaten at in Toronto! Great service (friendly, helpful, and not pushy), delicious food that is unique and can't be found at a lot of other places, and reasonable prices. I'd definitely come back here again and recommend it to anyone in town.  They do a fixed menu on Monday nights for $35, which is a great deal -- unfortunately, I missed it this time around but hope to come back here on a Monday to take advantage of it. I came here on a Tuesday around 8 pm and it was not super busy.   The decor is nice inside - lots of wood, small, and intimate. Dimly lit, but not too dark, and it's not too loud inside which makes it a great place for a date. The service was excellent - they were very attentive with refilling our water, they were friendly and great with recommendations for dishes.  I was glad my coworker and I shared an appetizer and 2 entrees, because everything looked so delicious -  I wanted to try everything. They start you out with complimentary savory mini muffins that are almost like a little cornbread muffin, with herbs, and smoked provolone & onion. I couldn't really taste the provolone or the onion too much, but it was a nice way to start off the meal.  Bangkok Bowl ($24) - This comes with thinly sliced pieces of yellow fin tuna, fried squid on the very top, all served over a mango jicama slaw. This was light, healthy, and flavorful. If I had only ordered just this for dinner, I probably would have still been hungry, but it was a perfect balance to all the other heavier dishes that we ordered. I'd reorder this, and recommend it.  Truffle Gnudi ($19) - Had at least 3 different kinds of mushrooms and gnudi is like gnocchi, but made with ricotta so it's extra fluffy and pillowy. Also, anything with truffle oil is delicious, so if you like mushrooms and/or truffles, you will like this dish. I recommend sharing between 2 people, as it's probably not enough for a full entree and it's rather rich. I'd reorder this, and definitely recommend it.  Burger ($17) - This was a Korean fusion burger, with provolone, gochujang aioli, and beansprout kimchi. It was a bit on the small side (I almost mistook it for a slightly bigger slider bu maybe I'm just used to larger, American-sized burgers). It was good, definitely unique and interesting, but not necessarily mind-blowing. The bun was also good - no cheap, white bread here, but it had a hint of egg / was a little brioche-like. I don't think I would order this again - was a good spin on an Asian-fusion burger, but I think I prefer my Korean food separate from my burgers. This came with a side of taro chips.  Overall, I really loved this place; it was delicious, had a variety of dishes (healthy, not-so-healthy), and at not-so-exorbitant prices. Looking forward to coming back here on another visit to Toronto!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in the city! Came here with a bunch of self-proclaimed Foodie's for the first time and then many times after. Incredible food, excellent service. Highly, highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Fun spot for sharing plates. With a wide spectrum or \"global\" flavours represented. Dropped in on a Thursday night and was immediately seated but from the buzz I think it will become very busy very soon. Dinner for 2 came to $90 all in, which was a little pricey considering we didn't drink. Room is semi submerged with a slightly industrial feel. Should be nice when the patio is open. Music was bumping but not ear shattering. Staff was super friendly introducing themselves by name and knowledgeable about dishes, preparation and ingredients. When they didn't know, they asked. We ate: Bone marrow: decadent as it should be, but needed more toast, tartare a little too fine and dried egg didn't add richness Chopped salad: the highlight. Every bite was different. Loved the taste and textures. Octopus: cooked tenderly, the molassesy sauce overpowered it but went well with pork belly Definitely room for improvement but a really good effort."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks.  Fun patio seating for dates and people watching. Saw a few people almost get hit by cars at the pedestrian crosswalk.  We got the tasting menu, and just sipped cocktails and wine as amazing dish after amazing dish came out for us.   The kale salad bowl was delicious.  The fish was fresh as f*ck  The beef rib was sparse, but mouthwatering.  Our server was as expected.  Spent hundreds of dollars in one night here.  I would go again."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the Food Dudes' food truck for a while, so I was legit excited to finally try this place out.  It's not brunch without a Caesar so I started with the Rasa Caesar, but I have to admit I wasn't a huge fan of this drink. It was just much, much stronger than I would've preferred. And extremely spicy. It was fine, I guess, but I did make a point of finishing the drink before I finished my meal, so I wouldn't be stuck with that taste in my mouth afterwards.  We started with the latkes, which, as per the menu, come accompanied with \"smoked sour cream.\" Aside from the fact that the sour cream wasn't even a little smoky, these latkes were definitely delicious and very different from the norm. They were comprised of thin potato straws, which ensured that the exterior was extremely (and pleasingly) crispy.  For my main, I got the Huevos Rancheros, which is described thusly: spicy black bean, avocado, fried eggs, cheddar, pico de gallo, smoked crema, salsa verde, tostada. This was a very, very tasty dish. It's probably one of the better Huevos Rancheros I've had in a while, as the ingredients were all cooked perfectly and it came with a very generous helping of delicious guacamole. There is one pretty major caveat, though: it's not spicy. Like, not at all. And when I asked for hot sauce, our waitress brought over a bottle of Frank's. Yeah, no, that's not at all what I meant.  Finally, we finished off the meal with the Rasa Donut. I was expecting just a generic donut, honestly, but there's nothing generic about this monster. The donut arrived at the table still warm and covered in a melted marshmallow topping. It was pretty exquisite, I gotta be honest."}
{"text":"Update to say that rasa has two new dishes that CANNOT be missed - French onion soup dumplings and a big juicy burger. Both are worth changing your current dinner plans for!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim on a busy Saturday night. There weren't any tables or bar spots available, but the gracious hostess let us wait inside for a place at the bar and took our cocktail orders. How civilized! And the wait was worth it. Highlights were the shawarma toast (excellent flavours), smoked branzino board, and scallops with lentils. Warm, rich, wintry and delicious. And there was so much more on the menu that looked promising. Great date night atmosphere and really special food. Can't wait to go back-- next time with a reservation."}
{"text":"Only had brunch here , but will def come back for dinner! Small menu, which makes it easy to choose ! Great coffee , great atmosphere and service was friendly. I had the ricotta scrambled and my bf had the rasa breakfast! Mmm mm mmm!!!!  Cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"First time at Rasa tonight and had the set Monday menu. It was a full house  so I sat at the chefs table/counter and watched the kitchen which was a real treat. Food was fantastic, service very attentive  and what more can you say about five dollar drinks. Go! Next Monday ( but make reservations)."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant if you're not hungry. The food portions are very small, so you can just keep spending your hard earned money on over priced hipster nonsense.   Honestly, I had to go somewhere else and have a second dinner after ordering their $29 beef ribs... Which came with a whopping 2 ribs.... With no sides. How can you run a restaurant that doesn't serve damn food?  Do yourself a favor and avoid this overpriced trap of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Always a Repeat for me .. from brunch to dinner it is excellent one can't ask for better"}
{"text":"This is one of Ju's favourite neighbourhood restaurants and I can see why. The perfect place to come for a late night drink and food. We showed up late Thursday night and the patio was bumping. Love the layout as the patio wraps around the sidewalk so you can people watch the night away.  We had a couple drinks to start (pricey at $12.00 to 14.00 but smooth) and they brought out a little amuse bouche for us to snack on while we waited.  - Amuse bouche - cheese puffs with a roasted red pepper spread. It was light, flaky, just the perfect bite sized to open the palate up. Well, for my friend at least! I was way too stuffed from eating all day to have a bite of her burger.  - Burger ($17.00) - ground steak, beef cheek, provolone, gochujang sauce and beansprout kimchi. Interesting combination with the Korean fusion influences. Ju ordered it and devoured her burger so I'm guessing that's a very good sign.  Rasa's Set Monday's menu looks pretty intriguing. $40.00 per person for an amuse bouche, salad, two mini entrees and dessert. Damn, that's a steal!"}
{"text":"Was fantastic. Beats were the bomb. Shrimp dish a must. Gnudi is a staple. Burger also great."}
{"text":"Loved Rasa! Stopped by on a whim mid-week. Knew nothing about the place.  Did the \"Experience\" tasting menu and we were blown away - the food and the service were all top notch.  The $60 experience was 8 courses (+ amuse): - Amuse, a tiny chewy Portuguese cheese bread - Chopped salad - was the only ho-hum dish of the evening, although the Harissa crunchy chickpeas were good. - Smoked sea bream on toast & albacore sashimi - the sea bream was jaw-droppingly good. \"Waiter! 6 more of these please!\" - Lamb loin  - Brussels sprouts & cauliflower cheese  - another winner.  - Cheese gnudi with mushrooms - even my wife who doesn't like mushrooms ate all of this. - Burger. Beef cheek, kimchi - things were getting a little David Chan overkill at this point; a rich drippy half-burger with the richness slightly offset by the kimchi - Bangkok bowl, tuna, buttermilk calamari - excellent crisp calamari. Please stop bringing us food!  - Bread pudding,  cream cheese, candied bacon. Think cinnabon with bacon. I'm going to explode."}
{"text":"This place beautifully blends art and good, which I love (but am not joined by all). I give it 3.5  It's small and cozy with a very hipster feel with all the succulents and raw wood in the decor; the patio is also nice (though too warm for my taste).   Had the chopped salad, which lived up to the hype. It's got everything, nice crunch, some sweet, sour and rich flavours with all the ingredients and is perfectly dressed. My beer was not ice cold, so points off for that!   The ¿spudicci? Looked beautiful and apparently good (though I can't say because my dining companion gobbled it all up...so I'm going to say good)   Portions are smaller as everything is intended to be shared here. Slightly pricier as two people would generally eat 3-5 dishes. They amuse bouche was a nice gluten free bread ball with cheese spread (the actual description was way too fancy to remember)."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but the service just wasnt there. I had a craving to try octopus and went to Rasa after seeing pictures of other people ordering it. We got seated right away despite not having a reservation. The ambiance was very cool. While ordering drinks the waitress asked if we had any allergies. My date said she was allergic to bell peppers. \"Me too!\" the waitress replied. We ordered the chop salad and octopus to share. \"Great choice\". They brought complementary cheese puffs which were delicious. Next the salad comes and sure enough it has bell peppers. Ugh. \"Thats ok Ill just pick them out\" my date says. But again it was delicious. We asked for another order of cheese puffs because they were so good the first time. Those never came. Then the octopus arrives. Im not exaggerating when i say the portion covered 1/4 of the plate. It looked like garnish without food. Friends have suggested it was likely an appetizer. It would have been a bit better if the waitress had mentioned the small portion when we ordered it specifically to share? Again it was still very tasty. At this point we decided against dessert for fear of being disappointed yet again and left to try a gelato place nearby. All in all it was a bit of a let down. Next time Im in a nice restaurant Ill come better prepared to ask how big the dishes are."}
{"text":"Went for dinner here with a friend, and it was pouring outside, little a/c inside. But as soon as we popped a window it was lovely inside. And by the time the food came I didn't care about the temperature. The dishes were perfection. The chopped salad is as good as everyone says. The octopus was cooked perfectly. And the staff were so pleasant and honest, it was quite refreshing. I could go on and on but just go and try it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had brunch at Rasa on a Sunday morning, we thought it was just okay. I had the Rasa breakfast and although it was good everything seemed really oily - between the greasy potatoes and the over-dressed salad I wasn't super happy with the meal. The bacon and sausage on the plate were both good. My friend ordered the ricotta hash which she also found a greasy.   She also asked for hot sauce and when we got the bill were very surprised to see we were charged $1 for it! First of all, that's crazy, and second of all, if you want to charge $1 for hot sauce you need to let customers know! On the topic of unreasonable costs, my coffee was $3.50. I know restaurant coffee is always expensive but that's a bit much for plain old drip coffee. The service was good, but not good enough that I'll come back here again for brunch."}
{"text":"They are specialized on comfort food.  Great place if you have cravings and it doesn't matter whether it's sweet or salty.  Cozy atmosphere + good price for big portions. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Went for brunch and thought it would be low key, but it was jam packed."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the food at this retaurant - I mean come on, the Food Dudes opened it so the food should be good - and it was. I went in for a birthday dinner with 6 lovely ladies so we tried pretty much everything on the menu. Great for sharing but bigger than your average tapas place so 2 dishes per person was certainly enough but I think we averaged 3.   I know everyone raves about the chopped salad but seriously, the chopped salad was something I could over and over and over. I was happy to see it's offered on their brunch menu because I would be interested in that for sure. Lots of fresh veggies and a light flavourful dressing. a total hit from start to finish.  Next I tried the Bankok Bowl: yellow fin tuna, fried squid, mango jicama slaw, smoked peanuts. DELICIOUS. The yellow fin (a sustainable tuna - points for that!) and fried squid was cooked perfectly and the mango jicama slaw a lovely pairing. I could have eaten two of these...  A third dish I split was also off the charts delicious - but a bit heavy for one person, you'll definitely want to share - the TRUFFLE GNUDI with local mushrooms, portobello soil, pickled shimenji, walnut pesto. I love mushrooms so this was a no-brainer and come on, add truffles and I'm in heaven. Decadent is how I'd describe this, soulful and made with love.   And while there is a lot of meat on this menu that I couldn't speak for myself, I did listen to my favourite ladies who tried the bacon and tomato (decent but not amazing), the lamb neck (really good but a bit too much on the plate, could be a smaller portion), the chicken and waffles that were the nightly special and enjoyed by all but big enough to split instead of for one person, side stripe shrimp (good shrimp but didn't need the sauce).  They brought us complimentary mini corn muffins which were quite delicious and they nicely brought out a dessert for me while I was in the loo which I couldn't eat because it was the sticky bun with candied bacon on it but I was so stuffed (and I'm not a dessert person anyway) so I happily sent it home with one of my friends. Not sure how that was reviewed.  All in all, I think for a sharing style restaurant, the portions are on the large size which for a table full of guys is probably a good thing but do consider that if you're not starving when you arrive. The prices are not cheap but the food is good quality - we had a cocktail (a very good old fashioned for me) and two bottles of wine (a delicious Italian red I can't remember the name of at the moment) and we each paid $100.   Our server also gave me a mystery gift card for my next visit - not sure what it's worth but it is good incentive to come back, although the food itself will likely bring me back anyway.  The decor is nice - a bit of an odd shaped corner patio but a decent size and then it's a couple of steps down off street level to the restaurant that is a mix of grey stone and warm wood that feels intimate. A great date place but also perfect for our group of 6."}
{"text":"What a beauty! Rasa was always on my to go list. We decided on a couple of dishes to share. First was the Chopped Salad. YOU. NEED. TO. GET. THIS. It was lovely, the flavours were amazing and that sauce around the dish was to die for. Plus as a bonus, this salad is completely instagramable. The short ribs were a delight, along with the lamb that we had. Nothing was disappointing and every dish we had was enjoyable.  I simply am a fan and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I came here because several friends have been. We had the fish oars which was VERY tasty. My favorite was the captures - Alba ore than and the octopus. The octopus had a bit of a spicy bite which was sooooo good.  For Mains we had the lamb and the yuca with fish. The dessert we chose was the sweet dish of the week. An amazing chocolate ganache and the cereal dessert. The ganache was so smooth and tasty.  Finally-if you ante going to get a drink the Eden Hall is so good. So drinkable, but be careful what you wish for, 1-2 will give you quite the buzz!"}
{"text":"Make reservations!!  This is going to my new go-to place in downtown Toronto...everything here is amazing!!!   We ordered the Bangkok Bowl, Pierogies, and Lamb Sirloin to share.  Bangkok Bowl had fresh yellow fin tuna, calamari, and veggies. The sauce compliments the ingredients, making it taste light and sweet. Pierogies were good. You can barely taste the duck..or any ingredients, but it was super mushy and soft. My favourite has to be the Lamb dish...i love lambs in general but I think this dish has definitely spoiled my taste buds. Meat is extremely tender, the veggies (eggplants and parsley) had a unique sweet-ish salty taste to it. The white sauce at the bottom just makes the entire dish more perfect than it can even be. It's a must try!  Service was great, we had our drinks refilled constantly, server checking up on us frequently. Really appreciate them asking for allergies before we even ordered. Nice atmosphere and good vibes. Really looking forward to visiting again for their brunch menu."}
{"text":"First of all, the place gets 5 stars for the quality of the food, it's outstanding and unique.  Unfortunately, the time between dishes was just way too long. We ordered 4 dishes to share between the two of us, and they arrived about every 30 minutes after we made our initial order. So yes, gradually over 2 hours we received 4 dishes plus 15mins more waiting for the bill.  At the end they appologized and explained it was because of computer problems. Fine, however if thats the case then act on it and comp your customer in some way.  Sadly no such thing. Thats bad customer service 101. Even though the owner/manager was there. Sorry, but you lost a repeat due to not owning up to your problem."}
{"text":"Great patio, good food and nice service. It was delightful to get a surprise treat from the chef. A place to remember and come back to."}
{"text":"I once read that Madonna was a genius and that she has a very high IQ.  I only say this  because I'm reminded of her \"Ray of Light\" video when I open the website.  After I dined here, I concluded that the food dudes have food IQ. Every dish was smart and well constructed. The chopped salad is a fattoush salad on steroids. The spare ribs are a carnivorous version of a root beer float. The cereal dessert is greeeeeaaaatttttt! (the sticky bin isn't bad either).  The service was courteous and attentive.    From the attention to detail in the dishes to fact that the music is good but set at a decibel level lower than a Chiefs game, Rasa is an enjoybale experience. I can see myself going regularly to see what new projects they dream up."}
{"text":"Highly recommend Rasa. Serious deliciousness! On business from Boston and would love to have this restaurant around the corner! The burger... yum!"}
{"text":"Amazing dinner, all the dishes were well prepared, presentation and taste were top notch.The chopped salad, truffle gnudi and the fish board was the standouts. Service was flawless, waiter took time to explain the dishes and made recommendations."}
{"text":"First time I have been here,  my friend had a list of restaurants he wanted to try out and this was one of them.  So lets get straight into it. Overall it was fantastic and will definitely be coming back.  Food was phenomenal, inside the restaurant is super nice, service was really friendly and on the ball.  Only complaint is my rye and ginger felt like it didn't have much rye in it (I find this a common issue everywhere... Maybe it's maybe baby face who knows)  My friend and I had the fish board.  Favorite was definitely the tuna.  All 3 fish dishes were incredible, the combination of flavors is great and everything worked well together.  Next was the truffle gnudi,  my favorite of all 3 dishes. I'll be honest I hate mushrooms and did not want to get this. This changed everything....  I would go back just for this honestly.  Lastly the burger....  Yeah one of best burgers you can get.  Really juicy, flavourful, and like every other dish all the components worked well together.  The rye and ginger is probably the only reason why it's not 5 stars,  I honestly hate getting weak drinks.  Bill was split and came out to 56.50 a person. Amazing value if you ask me."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here with another couple Sat night. Arrived around 8pm and although busy, we were seated within a few minutes by super friendly staff. Excellent service throughout the evening by attentive wait staff who actually worked as a team. Food was excellent. Plates are all devised to be shared by 4 people which allowed us to sample quite a bit of the menu. Chopped Salad was a surprise in a good way.  Note: the menu does not do justice in print so be sure to get the long form descriptions from your server (although that just made it harder to choose which is why we pretty much had half the menu). Cosy atmosphere. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Everyone was very welcoming and our server \"Mahore\" (not sure of spelling) was such a great guy to deal with. We ordered burgers and two appetizers, all were fantastic. We will try this place again for sure."}
{"text":"Upon researching new restaurants in the city, I came upon mention of Rasa and my interest was piqued. Came here on a Thursday night with a same day reservation - it was busy but not overcrowded. Service and decor were good but let's get straight to important part - the food!   Let me start off by saying everything we had was excellent. The attention to detail and flair of the plating only builds your anticipation as the dishes arrive and the flavors and textures do not disappoint. We had the seafood board, truffle gnudi, and cheese burger with kimchi. The burger was tender and melted in your mouth with flavor. The truffle gnudi was essentially gnochi but with cheese rather than potatoes and accompanied by a variety of tasty mushrooms. The seafood board consisted of tuna, octopus, and smoked trout with distinct garnishes to create unique taste profiles.   Recommend getting 2 items per person but keep in mind these are dishes that are great for sharing. All prices were very reasonable and I was full by the end of the meal - would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is delicious and the service is quick and friendly. There was a wait so we decided to try somewhere else, but luckily, the server ran outside to let us know that bar seating just opened up. We decided to take the seats and we are so glad we did!   The presentation for the dishes here is quite on point and tastes well balanced. The place feels more expensive than it is and the food is filling"}
{"text":"Went by on Friday night at 8:10 and surprised to see that the patio was empty except for people sitting at the seats that face the street.   When we asked if we could sit for dinner we were told that the tables outside that seat 4 were reserved for parties of 3 or 4 people (not 2) and that we could sit inside.  \"It's Friday and date night and the outside is saved for parties of 3 or more\" - thought that was a weird comment...should have brought at least one more person on our date I guess!? Not that appealing on a beautiful summer night to sit in an empty restaurant.  Seemed silly to turn us away on an evening that was not busy...Dailo's chefs tasting menu was amazing though!"}
{"text":"Came here twice--first time for a girlfriend's bachelorette dinner and second time with the boyfriend.  First time was spectacular. Each course was carefully plated and flavours were delicate and distinct. We were a table of 8-10 but the service we received was as if it were just a table of two--servers were attentive and took their time asking us about our dishes and clearing the table. The only thing I wish went different was that we'd get a better idea of how much we were going to be served because I was full to the brim at about 75% into our dinner. I wanted to try every dish, I really wanted to!  Second time was with the boyfriend. I took him here because of the first time and just as expected, everything went as good as the first time around.  Because this is a tapas restaurant, you're going to want to order more to try more dishes. Go with a bigger group and you'll be promised a world of beautiful flavours. And very likely, flavours you've never had before! As well, be prepared to fork out a healthy amount of dollars--however, I promise you it's worth every one of it!"}
{"text":"I have had a few people message me about Rasa and their interest in celebrating their special event at this restaurant. Last year I would have encouraged it, but today, I would dissuade you.   I returned to Rasa for my birthday this year, and I was very disappointed with the experience. It was a completely different experience than the one I had last year.   These were some of my concerns:   My birthday fell on a Monday, so my guests and I ordered from the set Monday menu - we have been to Rasa many times for their set menu on Mondays, and it has become progressively less impressive.   On this evening I asked for no onions - as I always have, and the waitress made my request difficult. The manager did come by to check in on us, and I mentioned to him how I wanted to order the shrimp dish, but was unable to because it had onions and it could not be omitted. He took care of it and arranged that it be made without onions - something I really appreciated.   The meal itself was ok - not as tasty as it used to be, the portions were small, and the service was average. Several times during the meal my friends kept asking, \"what happened? Rasa used to be so good!\" And in fact, at my birthday dinner last year, they treated us to a glass of bubbly, I was given my favorite dish as the main, even though it was not on the menu, and I got a lovely gift - a gift card that I used for brunch several weeks later. And the service was top notch - they made me and my friends feel very special - and I said as much in my review.   This time around I could not finish one dish - simply could not stand the flavor combinations - something I had never done before here. My favorite dish (the Bangkok bowl) is no longer on the menu, and they replaced it with a shrimp dish which was alright, but not as good as the tuna version. And after dinner was over, we were still really hungry (even the friends who ate everything on their plate), so I went home and cooked myself dinner - a thing I did not want to do on my bday.   The cost for dinner was $40 plus tax and tip for three courses - sounds like a good deal, but the portions and options do not make this deal worthwhile. It used to be $35 for three courses and I used to leave full.   Pros   Some dishes still tasty Manager does a good job when he steps in Nice space   Cons   Small portions Spotty service Hit and miss on dishes If doing a set menu, you won't get a full dessert  I don't think I will be returning to Rasa, but appreciate all the wonderful dinners I had here over the years. :)"}
{"text":"I should say, their chopped chickpea salad is a real win, and their food is fairly good for the most part.   That said, their drinks are in need of some serious help! Their sangria is MP and borders on non-potable; it's extremely sugary and has next to no fruit in it. Think kool-aid with an added bottle of gatorade, and one chopped orange. I couldn't drink it so I got a cocktail instead - fool me once, shame on...bottom line, my mistake! I should've gone with a safer bet: wine.   Overall, worth trying if you happen to be in the area. The price point is fair for the portion sizes, and i'm sure I would've had a totally different experience if not for the poor drink choices."}
{"text":"Went two nights in a row!  Great staff.  OMG beautiful food presentation. Chop salad rocks.  The truffle knudi was great.  The tuna superb."}
{"text":"Updating my overall review after coming here for 2 brunches and 1 dinner.  Dinner - 3.5 stars... great flavours but the food service was sooo painfully slow.  A little over 3 hours for a normal dinner.  We had spots of 45 minutes of no food in front of us. I'm not sure I can recommend this place for dinner.  Brunches - 5 stars for food and service... just amazing   We finally got dinner reservations for this great spot.  Patio is open for the summer... a really nice spot to enjoy the warm sun.  The only problem is that the food service was painfully slow.  Other tables in addition to ours had the same problems and some other tables were complaining.  I wish it was better so I can keep this place at 5 stars but I honestly wouldnt recommend coming here for dinner.  There are some bright flavours coming out of the kitchen but some of the food was served temperate warm and having no food for 45 minutes at a time, it was getting worrisome.  What I would have expected having 2 seatings... it was mostly one for most tables.  We saw so many people turned away and I can see why.  The kitchen just could not keep up or time the dishes to send out timely.  These are meant to be shared plates but they are on the slightly smaller side... so they do recommend 2 dishes per person... I would dare say 2.5 dishes per person more so.  Some of the food we ate  Chopped Salad - Best salad in Toronto... its the one reason I keep coming here for brunches.  Zesty combination of the jalapeno, goat cheese, and avocado smear combines with many fresh chopped vegetables and the super crunchy chick peas.  It's a burst of fresh flavours... definite winner.  Brussels Sprouts - Solid rendition of sriracha and cauliflower 'cheese' on cooked brussels.  I kinda liked them... they were served barely warm.  It would have been better if they were hot.  Octopus, sous vide and then grilled - nice flavours and the octopus was very tender with nicely charred bits to add more flavour and crunch.  Unfortunately similar to the sprouts, it was served lukewarm.  I did like the roasted almonds and creamy coconut yogurt to give it added crunch and flavour.  Shrimp - 4 medium large shrimp... it was served closer to room temperature and that was unfortunate.  The smokey tomato sauce was a nice flavour.  It just couldnt save the dish.  Sticky Bun - This is a large caramelized bun that is served hot with some candied bacon and it sits on top of a cream cheese smear.  This was the 2nd best dish of the night and probably the hottest dish served.  Soft pillowy bread that has lots of crunchy walnut pralines pieces creating crunch and caramelized flavour.  This is a definite winner.  Overall... good option for brunch but unfortunately I cannot recommend it for a dinner.  I know a full tasting menu of 6+ dishes not including amuse bouche and dessert is normal for a 3 hours session but this was more a painful waiting game of lukewarm but decent dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food, and drinks!  Stopped by for an early dinner with my husband. I passed this place a lot and always thought it looked like a romantic spot. And it is! We sat on their patio on a very hot day - the restaurant was just as warm as it was outside. I really enjoyed the \"neighbourhood\" vibe and how easy going the guests and staff are with recommendations. We split everything and I left feeling satiated.  The Brussel Sprouts were my absolute favourite! I make something like this at home so it shouldn't have wowed me, but it did. The Acorn Squash was delicious and I liked the idea of the grana padano foam. The Burger - which came with ube (taro) chips - was so good. We ordered a drink because it looked so good as it was being delivered to another table. It was extremely refreshing on such a hot day, I wish I remembered the name! I'm glad we didn't see the price before we ordered :O.  The casual vibe, excellent food and service, and neighbourhood charm makes this a standout experience. Not terribly tough on the wallet unless you want to order a drink or two."}
{"text":"Rasa really exemplifies the type of fine dining restaurant I would frequent. The people who make things tick are young, creative, talented, and seem to love what they do. The atmosphere is chic without being pretentious, and the clientele often follow the same trend. At the heart of the kitchen is the very talented and personable chef Davin. You can really feel the genuine passion for his work as he describes the small details that make every plate nearly perfect with great enthusiasm.   The menu changes at least seasonally and most items are meant to be shared. Bite sized savoury muffins are offered in place of bread to start. The chopped salad which includes quinoa, feta, grapes, and crispy chickpeas is a very refreshing way to start. The sides of the salad bowl are covered with a thick dressing that will allow you to control the spiciness based on how much of it you mix in. The fish board is my current favourite menu item. Although you have the choice to mix and match the components, I would recommend opting for the platter with all of the options (currently smoked trout, tuna, and swordfish). The cured swordfish topped with fermented grape, razor thin slices of jalapeño, and a touch of smoked sour cream will transport you straight to seafood heaven. Next up would be the lamb neck on toast and the perfectly seasoned/ cooked Wagyu beef ribs. The Thai inspired tuna and calamari bowl and the burger made of ground steak and beef cheek are other menu items I am salivating just thinking about. Previous menu items such as the beef tongue sandwich and the fall soup were also delectable and I do hope they make a comeback!  Overall, a great dining experience from start to finish during every visit so far. Credit goes to Yelp/ Food Dude's Devan for the suggestion, and the staff for running a restaurant our city can be proud of. Well done."}
{"text":"We came here on a busy Saturday night and were able to get a seat within 10 minutes of waiting. Excellent customer service - I love that they respond to text messages if they aren't able to pick up the phone. We ordered the squash salad, grilled octopus, and kimchi burger. The burger was absolutely delicious and one of the best I've had in the city (better than Richmond Station and on par with Harbord Room). I'd come back just for the burger."}
{"text":"I like that you can make reservations for brunch at Rasa, guaranteeing a seat instead of having to wait like at many other brunch institutions. I was interested in trying this restaurant as it's opened by the people behind Food Dudes food trucks (so good!). I ordered the Rasa Breakfast which included cheddar scrambled eggs, maple smoked bacon, grilled chorizo, latkes, grilled salad & toast. It sure sounds like alot, but what actually arrived was a much much smaller portion than expected. Maybe I was just really hungry and looking forward to a big portion. Every component on the plate was delicious and super flavourful though, just wish there was more. My two girlfriends ordered the Huevos Rancheros which was a vibrantly coloured plate - looking like a larger portion than mine, all served on a large tostada. I will probably order this the next time. Interested in trying the dinner here sometime too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our 4th anniversary and also went the night before we became parents to our beautiful twins.  The food is some of the best in the city!!  The tasting menu is what we recommend although you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Staff is incredible and the vibe is awesome.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, beautiful food. We had the Octopus, Branzino and Brussel Sprouts and loved every dish."}
{"text":"The Sticky Bun was simply amazing, even after traveling all the way to California.  I really took my time and enjoyed every bite of it...,two thumbs up for Olivia's creation!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Service spectacular.  Decor and ambiance was lovely.  Great dining experience.  The chopped salad was great but he soup noodles were orgasmic.  5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Drinks are good. Decent vibe. Nice patio. Food is not great. Chopped salad is good but rest of the dishes were either completely flavourless or doused in one strong sauce and overwhelming. Way overrated. Way better places to eat for the price."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and blown away both times. The ambience and service is great but also low key and upscale at the same time. You know a restaurant has chops when even their simplest items taste amazing. The mushroom gnudi and brussel sprouts were great. I will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and we were seated on the patio. The patio space is really cute and quiet.   I had the fish toast with a side of potatoes, a ceasar, and finished with their peach donut. Everything was really yummy. I especially liked the fish toast and their potatoes were crunchy and salty but a bit too greasy.   Service was attentive and fairly quick as they weren't too busy. They were good on water and checking up on us. Everyone that came to our table was super friendly.   My only complaint is the portion sizes. I was a little disappointed that my fish toast was only on one slice of bread with a small side of potatoes."}
{"text":"We arrived late in the evening and were seated quickly. As other parties were finishing up their meals it became quieter, but the music was pounding away. Hard to hear each other, hard to hear the server.  In the meantime, the food was delicious. Just delicious. Every plate was interesting. It is nicely presented and explained. The steak tartare was perfect.  The staff seemed to work well with each other, in and out of the kitchen. The atmosphere was friendly and unrushed. But the food was definitely the star."}
{"text":"I actually felt pretty lucky to dine in this speak easy of a bar restaurant. The room was dimly lit with exposed pipes and cozy ambiance. The food was pretty amazing - not sure if it's just them or Canada in general but the duck breast we had was cooked to perfection.   It was one of our first large meals in Toronto so we splurged a little bit and selected a variety of dishes to share - this was definitely a better way to go than their tasting menu.   I would definitely recommend this place to visitors and locals alike."}
{"text":"Well that was delish! Nice surprise, although the review rating is high on this place and there is reason for it, so it shouldnt be too surprising at this point. Booking a time seemed not too easy because they seemed pretty booked up way in advance.  Very friendly staff and helpful. Despite how booked up they were it was not over crowded and they did not rush you out. Decor was rustic, cosy, not pretentious and also modern-reclaimed-ish (edison lights and piping). I do like the clever way they have their menu \"from soil, from land, from sea\". A lot of personality to this place. Prices are reasonable too considering the amazing food in this place - I like that this makes it accessible for many more ppl to experience - hope they dont change that.  Another Tapas or sharing place - which I tend not to like because many places say this, yet the experience and sizes of the dish and the flavors tend not to go well as a sharing platter -BUT  THIS place does it right! In fact, you want to share these yummy morsels because everything tastes so good and portions are done well (there was 3 of us).  Food was Over all so Yummy! So much thought into the various flavors within a bite and balance of the over all dishes. Its all up there with my fav Slaw from Lee's. Not a bite is wasted with boring filler flavor in this place, which I find most places do (ie: one good dish and many mediocre ones, or a flavorful main meat then garnishes are there to just fill up the plate but tasteless) - but not here, not a bite wasted - if that makes any sense.  Scrumptious (yes I used that word) complimentary gluten free baked cheese ball doughy-like stuff .... we would have just ordered more of this! (complimentary stuff is always a great perk but it tasted soooo good as well! Got us excited as to what else was to come)  The recommendations from our waitress was pretty good. Though I have a feeling everything on the menu is pretty great.... I'll have to go back and order differently to confirm that :) .  The Chopped salad has such and understated name -because its bursting with flavour! The kinda salad that gives you new flavors with every bite you take, the salty, savory, sweet all combined with a bit of spice, and the textures of soft and crunchy and leafy. This can actually make me think I could survive if I was to ever turn vegetarian. The sweet potato was a surprise - however do they jullienne the potato and cook it just right - pretty warm and mild at the same time - my friends liked it and it was good but among the rest of the dishes we had it was the mildest in flavor for me.  The Bangkok bowl was another bursting with many flavors dish. Perfect balance with the tuna and fried calamari . The only thing was that by mixing it all together with the calamari the fried outer layer fell off and the crispy outer was hidden in the mix; better to pick off the calamari and tuna and then mix the rest.  We also had another fish dish which was mild and flavorful. Shamefully I forgot the name of it.  Overall very satisfying tasty meal  even considering we did not yet order from the \"from land\" meat section. I would definitely come back, bring more friends and I have already recommended it to others.  I recommend putting it on your bookmark list!  --- edit Well, was a 5 but now I have to dock it to a 4 - 3.5,  this place got me so excited to show others who also enjoy food - maybe even more than myself. I practically ordered the same things but something was missing....The chopped salad was good but nothing wowing me this time . I really cant put my foot on it as to why it wasnt as great (and no, it wasnt the company I was with!) but it does frustrate me when the consistency of great dishes is lacking...) - maybe an off night for them, who knows."}
{"text":"I'd probably rate this 3.5 but rounding down since it's got such high reviews anyhow.  Food is 3.5/5, service 3/5.  Decided to try it knowing that it was a tapas place since it had rave reviews.  To make reservations they ask you to text which is interesting.  I text for a table for 2 ten min before we arrived and got a reply back that they were looking forward to serve us.  When we arrived they couldn't find my reservation which wasn't a big deal since they were busy but still had plenty of seating.  They have an outside area and the regular indoor dining area.  We opted to sit outside since it was nice out.  Lots of staff and everyone is pretty friendly.  Our server was \"mahore\" or something like that.  He was friendly and explained the menu to us.  We ordered:  Chopped Salad $15 Duck confit $29 Rasa Burger $18 Truffle Gnudi $20  About 10-15 after ordering we were given a complementary appy: two Amuse Bouche (per the photos other have posted).  This is a Brazilian cheese bread (Pão de Queijo) made out of a tapioca starch.  The difference is they were flatter and not as fluffy as the Brazilian version, but they were placed on top of a really nice orange sauce.  About 10 min later we were given the chopped salad, which was very tasty.  After that we waited about 25 min for the Truffle Gnudi.  That was delicious.  There were 4 different mushrooms along with two ricotta stuffed pasta things.  It was really perplexing why it took so long because while we were waiting two other tables were served the same dish.  You would think they could make it at the same time instead of batch per batch because it was quite a big wait between when the other tables were served and when we were served.  Waiting about 25 min for our third dish which was the sous vide duck confit.  Quite pricey $29 for 5 slices of dick with a variety of different sauces and some veggies.  Wasn't bad but would only rate 3/5.  First time having sous vide but considering there's been so much hype with sous vide I didn't think it was anything spectacular as it was any more super tender than how I've had non sous vide duck and especially not worth the price.  After that dish we waited yet another 20 min for our burger, which the waiter claimed was the #2 burger in the world.  Perhaps he must have meant to say in Toronto as how does one determine your ranking in the world?  The burger was tasty but for $18 you would think you could throw in a few chips like some of the other photos show.  After the four dishes I would say I was full but not stuffed.  The service was super slow.  Just over 1.5 hours for 4 tapas dishes is a bit ridiculous I think.  While waiting for our dishes the girls next to us we commenting how slow everything was.  When we sat down they were eating and finished the truffle dish themselves and they waited quite a while for their next dish.  The girls also commented it wasn't anything big deal although they did mention that the sticky bun dessert was to die for, but for $12 it better be damn good.  Our server was only ok.  He wasn't super attentive to us or the girls on the table but he was super chatting with another table of 4.  He did ask us a few times how things were after serving 2 of our 4 dishes and he refilled water in the beginning but after being there for more than 1 hour our water was not refilled by him.  One of the other Wait staff did come to refill our water but that was after we finished eating at 1.5 hour mark.  He was extremely chatty with another table that seemed to be having a set menu though.  The girls next to us were commenting about the service too.  And although they finished eating was before us they waited about for about 15-20 min to catch the servers attention so they could ask for their bill.  Maybe the rave reviews were about some of the other dishes that weren't offered on the menu (fish platter and Buddha bowl) but it's not a place I would go back to especially spending $100 on!  But then again maybe because I am picky as I come from Vancouver, BC where good food is plentiful!  Btw they do indicate at the bottom of the menu that you can take a photo and text it to a number and they will in turn provide a meal to a person in need."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. Delicious inventive menu, cool atmosphere and super friendly staff! Just go!"}
{"text":"Wanted to celebrate my son's 30th birthday somewhere special but fun.  My daughter suggested Rasa and although I hadn't heard of it, I decided to give it a try.  WOW!  What an incredible evening.  Spectacular service, sensational food, creative presentation and phenomenal ambiance.    Each dish was better than the next and believe me, I think we tried them all!. Six of us likely ate enough food for 10 but it was worth the calories.  The variety of flavours and textures tickled our tongues with each bite.  Never have  we enjoyed falafel, cabbage rolls, fresh tuna and corn muffins so much.  And those are only a few of the many dishes we had the privilege of devouring!  Honestly, I cannot say one negative thing about Rasa except that maybe I am  over-the-top full and wonderfully satisfied.  Thank you Rasa for providing my family and I with a memorable dinner that was delicious, inventive and better than anything I have tasted in a very, very long time!"}
{"text":"Don't come to this hood often so decided to check out the restaurants around here and wow! Loved this place! Such a cozy but classy environment, good service, good music, and the food was AMAZING took one bite of the main (fish platter) and was shocked at how good it was. Dessert changes often and the crepe with lemon curd and coconut shavings and vanilla ice cream hit the spot (so full so didn't finish). And uh, complimentary appie to start? How classy is that? highly recommend (probably need reservations it's tiny and gets packed! i was solo at the bar and even had to move)"}
{"text":"This place was great. I was dropping some friends off at ROM so we parked and headed down Danford on foot, looking for a place to have lunch. We spotted this interested looking place and stepped in, knowing immediately we would stay for lunch. It has a great steampunk decore.   There was only room at the counter to sit but it turned out to be a great location as we could watch the coming off the grill and getting plated. Everything looked good. Presentation was great and literally everything caught my attention.   The waiter said the breakfast burger would 'blow our mind' and he was spot on. Out friend had the Huevos Rancheros. It too was unique. It earned a big thumbs up and seemed to disappear before I could ask for a taste.   I have no hesitation in ranking this place a 5!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. Came for my birthday. The food is incredible. The ceviche and chopped salad is amazing. The service was great. They even gave me a gift card because it was my birthday. Definitely would recommend it."}
{"text":"After seeing all the pictures of beautifully plated food this place executes I knew I had to visit this restaurant.  Hubby and I decided to come here for our Anniversary dinner and boy was I glad I chose here. From booking our reservation over the phone to leaving the restaurant feeling spoiled and stuffed the service competes with the best among the city.  Upon entering we warmly greeted by a hostess, after confirming our reservation with her, she wished us a Happy Anniversary which I found very thoughtful that they would make note of. She kindly led us to a cozy table in the front of the restaurant beside a window peering out onto the patio and hustle and bustle of the main streets. We sat against a distressed brown leather banquet with rustic wood panelling above and concrete floors below.  Our waitress for the evening soon came over and wished us a Happy Anniversary as well. She went over the menus with us explaining that the dishes are served tapas style and she recommends ordering at least 4 dishes to share between the 2 of us.   Soon after placing our food and drink orders with our waitress we noticed her returning with what looked like the wrong drink orders. She brought over two glasses of persecco which she explained were compliments of the house as we are celebrating our anniversary. Touched by the gesture we thanked her immensely. She then returned with our 2 glasses of Pinot Grigio.  Onto the food... Here's what we had  Amuse Bouche - Complimentary warm cheese puffs served on top of a creamy roasted red pepper sauce. Very light and mild tasting just enough to stimulate your appetite to the feast that was on it's way  Brussel Sprouts - scotch bonnet vinegar, cauliflower cheese sauce I am a sucker for brussel sprouts and these have to be some of the best I've ever had! Perfectly caramelized to bring out there natural sweetness balanced with the mild and tangy scotch bonnet vinegar and creamy cauliflower cheese sauce and then piled high with fried onions was absolutely scrumptious!   Chopped Salad - vegetables, quinoa, jalapeño feta, Harissa chickpeas The waitress explained the dressing of the salad was smeared around the bowl so we could mix in as much or as little as we wanted. We totally mixed it all in there and this salad definitely lives up to it's hype. So refreshing, crunchy, a little spicy, and creamy it definitely taps all your senses.  Spiducci -  lamb tenderloin, halloumi, pomegranate, labneh, pine nut gremolata Perfectly cooked so tender and aromatic, the meat was adorned with the crunchy pine nut gremolata sitting on a cloud of that garlicy lemony creamy labneh. Oh and who can forget those irresistible chunks of fried halloumi.  Short Rib Steak - yuzu bbq sauce, schmaltz potatoes, beef tendon, pho dip The yuzu bbq sauce really made this dish for me! A nice punch of flavour slathered on that smokey tender melt in your mouth meat was heavenly. Oh and the schmaltz potatoes were so crispy and golden were a fluffy potato interior.   Overall this was a spectacular experience from start to finish. All the dishes were beautifully plated like works of art, taste was impeccable each dish tapping into many different flavours and textures, and service was absolutely phenomenal, warm,  and friendly. After taking care of the bill we promptly left as we had plans for dessert. The hostess ran after us as we were leaving. She again wished a Happy Anniversary and presented us with a $15 giftcard to use on our next visit. Needless to say this restaurant went above and beyond in making our Anniversary a memorable and we will definitely be making a return visit!"}
