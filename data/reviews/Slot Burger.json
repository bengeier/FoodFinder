{"text":"My new favorite Burger joint in North Las Vegas.  This place offers fantastic food the Big Fat Daddy Burger was delicious."}
{"text":"I was in North Las Vegas on a business trip and stopped in the Slot Burger for a bite due to its convenient location on Craig and Lamb. The restaurant is split into two sections - a large smoke-free seating area for dining and a smoking permitted bar with bartop slot machines. There is a big glass wall separating the two sections so the smoke doesn't get into the dining area. I opted for the bar and was greeted by a very cheerful bartender. She set me up with a menu and a free beer for playing on the slot machines (woo-hoo!). I ordered the \"Big Fat Daddy\" which was seriously big and really good - much better than the typical chain burger offering.

The slots have a good assortment of poker, keno, blackjack and video reel games with a quarter progressive and a rewards system for earning points and random free play prizes. The bartender was nice enough to show me how it worked and got me signed up.

Overall, it was a great experience. Definitely seems like a locals favorite - the bartender knew many of the customers and greeted them by name. If I lived in Vegas I'd probably make it a regular stop too."}
{"text":"Three at best, the band was really good everything else was in the normal range. The service was terrible"}
{"text":"For something close to the house & you don't feel like the drive, it's going on till 4 a.m"}
{"text":"I love this bar. When i moved to this side of town I wanted a bar that I can just relax. I like the atmosphere. I can play pool,have a few drinks and they have good food. I love their burgers and the bartenders are so nice and funny. Plus I can come watch football here. Hint this is a patriots bar. It's not just a bar but they have a separate spit for food only. So u can bring your family to eat"}
{"text":"Really great food and awesome environment and friendly bartender! Ordered the Boss and fries with a pretzel bun and our bartender Bree was awesome! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good time"}
{"text":"First off let me say that the food here is really good. However, the service is horrible. And Im not writing this after one horrible service experience I am writing this after 3 horrible experiences. Funny enough, I've only been there 3 times. I never write bad reviews but after 3 times here being served by the same waitress, I just have to say the service stinks! I always go here on my hour long lunch break since its a short 10 minute walk there and 10 minutes back. On my last occasion here today, (and when I \"last\" I mean I will never patron this place again) I arrived at 110pm. The waitress took my order at 112pm. I thought I had plenty of time to eat and get back to work. By 140pm, nearly 30 minutes after I ordered, I still had not received the hamburger I ordered. I couldn't wait any longer and had to get back to work. I only get an hour for lunch and half of it was spent waiting for food I never received. I told the waitress I had been waiting nearly 30 minutes for my food. She asked if I wanted it to go and I said no. I hardly had enough time to get back to work -- let alone eat. I let her know that every time I go there it takes forever to be served. She didnt seem to care much. Maybe if people stop going there she will care more. I ended up not getting anything for lunch which made the second half of Monday really crappy. If you have a long, long, long time to sit and waste for food then definitely check this place out. However, if you value your time, especially on your lunch break, do not go here. The good food just does not justify the terrible service."}
{"text":"I had the absolute best Chicken Philly sandwich ever at Slot Burger.. You can't go wrong with Ben and Robert cooking for you."}
{"text":"This place used to be cool when it was the juke joint. Service is awful. There was a fly in my nachos! Bartenders are lazy. Never going back. Used to gamble here and eat great lunch specials. Now it's wack as fuck. Broke marks and bustas galore."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was non-existent. The table was never set up, so there was no silverware around.  Then there was no condiments.  By the time we got these things the food was cold."}
{"text":"Great. Food great service.. I love there burgers they are the best in town. I recommend eating here to anyone who lives in Vegas or is just visiting.."}
{"text":"service here is so terrible & the food is definitely not great if you compare with other bar/restaurant style spots like pt's, sierra gold, fireside, or the bar. my boyfriend & i gave this spot a chance last night for a quick breakfast burrito for dinner and some beers. the bartending waitress had to hear our order 3 times to get it and she still messed up. she told us it was her third job or something under her breath? but, waiting almost 15 minutes to get a friendly hello or get our order in was a little beyond ridiculous. 

the breakfast burrito was lathered in grease and hard to eat. ended up eating half of it and asked for the check after we finished our two beers. the glasses were sticky and with the food quality being the way it was on top of such lackluster service made me truly wonder how this place has high ratings. i guess they have 12 regulars that really don't get the same service & lack of quality we received last night? i definitely don't recommend coming here because you can get way better service & food quality at any other bar/restaurant venue in town."}
{"text":"Food was awesome and Amanda is really cool. She took care of us when we came through. Machines are good had a couple 4 of kinds my friend hit big on keno but didn't walk away lol. Great spot wished I lived closer tho."}
{"text":"How the best lunch today.everyone should come try our new menu it is great food 24 hours."}
{"text":"Slot Burger is the burger spot you want, their burger game is on point. Insane quality matched by a price that makes it silly to settle for another drive through situation. It's nice that you can enjoy gaming or an adult beverage,but if the family enjoys the restaurant atmosphere, it's right next door. Enjoy the burger N. Las Vegas has needed."}
{"text":"We are small business located near Slot Burger and every Friday we order take out from a local place.  We thought we would give Slot Burger, a new place that just opened up around the corner, a try....Boy, we were not disappointed! We ordered take out today for 30 people.  We ordered the BBQ and it was FANTASTIC!  I can't wait to try the rest of the menu.  Well done Slot Burger and kudo's to Dawn who handled our order like a champ."}
{"text":"Went to Slot Burger for lunch. Terrible service, waited 10 minutes, no one showed to take my order. Ended up walking out."}
{"text":"Loved the place and the wings and fries we ordered but man the fries was one of the best I've had yummm. We liked the bartender. DJ Cham was awesome again. The GM Randy is hot would hang out here again."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers! Great Service! Cold beer! Couldn't ask for much more! Thanks Slot Burger!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very old school I must say. 
Not as busy as expected but sometimes a late night bite is better in solidarity. Had their house burger with grilled onion, must say, I recommend. Fries are great, after you season them with salt and pepper. Thick cut, nice touch to the pretzel bun. Only had one server on the floor, understandable, but the tables were dirty, chairs pulled out, napkins on the floor, no complaints just the service could have been better, but definitely will return for the food. 
Thanks slots burgers."}
{"text":"Gourmet burgers, slot machines, pool tables, and family dining in the non-smoking restaurant. The service was excellent and very friendly. I hear that they have live music nights too! I'll have to return with more friends."}
{"text":"Had some of the biggest jumbo wings ever. Amanda was a amazing server and Ben made the the best chili cheese fries and wings we have had in a along time. The new kid on the block is great thanks."}
{"text":"So my friend and I were looking for something to eat that was clean se to the movies. We saw this while searching the internet. We went for the Boss Burger and fries, which is a 1/3 lb a bit bigger then the Slot Burger 1/2lb. We were greeted by a very nice bartender, Amanda. Great service and the burgers were hell a good!!!!"}
