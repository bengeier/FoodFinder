{"text":"Ordered a seafood hoagie and fries.  Sandwich tasted ok but too much bread & not enough product to compensate.  Fries either had a coating to them (like burger king does) or possibly dirty fryer oil.  Didn't care for the fries."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a different pizza shop. I tried This place and didn't like anything. My pizza had slices that didn't have cheese on it. The Steak  sandwich was dry and had no flavor. I had to add mayo and seasoning from home on it. Just didn't like the food."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza shops i know. I tried buffalo ranchero pizza and it was delicious. Strongly recommended"}
{"text":"I order from La Felice all the time! It's my favorite place. Each time I order from them the food is always fresh, hot and on time. I usually order from North Hills location and tried Moon location for lunch today. Excellent as always!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for Pizza, wings and even burgers! After trying all of the different pizza delivery in the area, this is by far my favorite. Burgers have recently become a regular order of mine. They have such a specific flavor of seasoning. The wings are large and of a very good quality and the pizza is always hot, fresh, delicious and most importantly ALWAYS ON TIME."}
