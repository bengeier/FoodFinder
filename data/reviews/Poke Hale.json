{"text":"I wanted to try this place since I love poke. I was greeted by 2 friendly guys who asked me if I had questions about the menu. They were very helpful. I had ordered a burrito, and it was pretty tasty.  I had the tuna and salmon with crab salad. The sides that go inside the burrito was a good selection. The Fish tasted fresh and they have a cool machine that puts the rice on the nori for the burrito, pretty cool to watch. The inside is very clean and modern. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We couldn't wait for Poke Hale to open. If you remember the Mervyn's ads (open, open, open) that was us.  Finally they opened and we eagerly anticipated fresh poke close to home. We weren't disappointed. The fish was incredibly fresh and well seasoned.  The array of toppings seemingly endless it was in a word; delicious and everything we anticipated.  Super friendly staff, and scrupulously clean. 5 stars and then some."}
{"text":"Poke Hale is really good and everyone is super friendly. So glad this opened by my work!"}
{"text":"Nice poke choice. Price was comparable with other places, but they had cooked bulgogi when we came, a good option for kids who are not into raw fish. They had no yellowtail, btw. House sauce was awesome."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! The poke comes in either a bowl or burrito and many toppings to choose from. The poke is the best I have tried in the Phoenix area. I highly recommend it if you like poke or want to try something different."}
{"text":"I was so excited to have a new poke place open up by me. I went in and tried it for the first time last night, had the rice bowl with 3 scoops fish and toppings. It tasted okay, but I was put off by how expensive it is and how skimpy they were on the fish and even crab mix. I could definitely get more fish and pay less money at Pokitrition in Chandler. It's a little further drive, but worth it!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Was immediately greeted and they walked me through the menu. In addition offered samples of the sauces to see which one I wanted on my bowl. My bowl was so delicious and they were just super friendly. I can't wait to come back here."}
{"text":"I have tried allll the poke spots around, and this one is hands down the best! Great location, super cute and clean (like, instagram worthy) and the staff was incredibly helpful and friendly! The menu has healthy, delicious options for everyone, and everything is super fresh and colorful. As a self proclaimed poke fan, Poke Hale is my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh fish. Fresh ingredients. Great service. It's like a coastal poke spot landed here in the desert. Don't pass on this place, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Place is grindz!!!  Their \"Hawaiian Style Poke\" comes the closest among all the pokebowl places I've tried in the EV.  

They filet their own ahi.  Nice, big pieces of fish!"}
{"text":"Came to AZ for a business trip, leaving my home (Hawaii) for a week. Visiting this place took me back home for a bit. I love my fish, and Poke Hale exceeded my expectations. Mahalo Poke Hale 'ohana! A hui hou"}
{"text":"Finally a real Poke place on the east side. This is the only spot that's like the legit Poke you can get in Cali. On top of the great food, the guys that run the joint are always so welcoming, and remember your order after one time. I would recommend to anyone. 

All sauces"}
{"text":"I found out about this place from the PHX Night market! They're poke is well seasoned/marinated. I can say that this is the best Poke I've tried! I like how the containers have a lid attached, beats a trip of asking for one. Ordering is pretty simple. Service can be a better. And wish they had a more drinks to offer than fountain sodas, like a refreshing cucumber lemonade to pair with their tasty Poke! I do recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I am a fan!
What separates this place from the couple other poke places I've been to in the past few months is their ownership. They are there, they are welcoming and they are engaging.

I usually get 3 and have even bought 4 scoops of protein and even the 3 scoops is enough to satisfy this protein hungry girl.  I really love their toppings of fried onion and fried garlic... cuz, damn!
My boys like to eat their \"burritos\" with salmon and they thoroughly enjoy every bite.  I love that I can eat healthy here and feed my kids something healthy and filling from here that they enjoy."}
{"text":"We have been in many times and will continue to come in! The staff is always very friendly and the food is consistently fresh and delicious! We have tried the seared bowl, Korean beef, Cali bowl, and made our own creations. They even have miso soup and it's made perfect. They never disappoint! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing has a new name and its Poke Hale! This place is so good I ate there for lunch and went back for dinner! Not too many places would get that kind of love from me, but the people and the food make it worth it! Amazing food and incredible employees make this my new go to spot. Even as I'm writing this I'm thinking I may be going here for lunch today!"}
{"text":"My family and I eat here at least once a week. IMO is freshest tasting poke around. My daughters are picky but love masago and they are always accommodating, giving them a big helping of it."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Super healthy and super delicious. The food is great and the staff is courteous. Think about this place like a Poke restaurant with a Chipotle setup. You select a bowl, and you tell them what you want on your bowl. Rice, Spicy Tuna, Tuna, Cucumber, etc... Prices are pretty reasonable as well. Check them out. 

This place is definitely 'Primetime'!"}
{"text":"I'm sad I don't live so close...I could eat there every day...so good..and every one so nice"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Poké fan. I came here for lunch and had the Spicy tuna and Hawaiian Tuna. The fish was fresh but the man behind the counter mixed the two different types of tuna in one bowl. I stood there watching my tuna get raped. I thought to myself...well there goes what could have been a great lunch. The purpose of having two types of tuna is to taste them and choose which you like better or love them both. I'll never know now because I wont be going back.  I was not impressed with the sauce either and that's everything to me. I like everything in my poke bowl to be separate instead of being whipped in a bowl like eggs. I prefer poke eats off Alma School, it's worth the 10 minute drive."}
{"text":"Some of the most solid and fresh pieces of tuna I've ever had at a poke place! Super good. Super fresh and super friendly! These guys know what they're doing. Definitely recommend them over just about any other poke place out here."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic fresh food.  Lunch time is a bit busy but they move everyone through the line pretty quickly!  I had a \"burrito\", which is pretty much an inverted sushi roll, stuffed with yummy spicy tuna, Hawaiian tuna, spicy crab, seaweed, ginger, masago, cucumber, mango, spicy house sauce, and seasoning.  Super tasty, quick, filling, and affordable.  Highly recommend and will be going again soon!  Didn't take a photo of the masterpiece unfortunately but it was most definitely amazing!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our first time here! My husband and I ordered the bowls with spring mix. The employees are super friendly and made sure we enjoyed our meals (which we did)! The fish was fresh and portion size was just right. We also ordered musubi to share which was delicious as well. Will be coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just the particular evening that I dropped by, but the servers really skimped out on the servings at my first visit to Poke Hale. 
With serving scoops smaller than that of an ice cream sccoper, I legitimately counted 4 pieces of salmon and 4 pieces of tuna in a make-your-own-bowl. The other toppings that came with my salad were alright, but the house dressing that accompanied the salad essentially doused the entirety of the greens, making every bite soggy and way too salty, despite me asking for easy sauce. For $12, your \"poke bowl\" experience probably isn't worth the price for what you'll be getting. You could probably get larger servings and the exact ingredients you want by buying elsewhere or getting ingredients from the store and making some poke yourself."}
{"text":"First time trying this place today. Here are my thoughts...

Staff was very friendly and helpful
Food was very fresh and tasty
The ordering process is somewhat confusing but this probably cuz I've never had poke before
The portions were small for the price but again maybe I didn't order correctly?

I had the Hawaiian Poke Bowl on brown rice with mango, seaweed and cucumber salad and house sauce. 

Wife created her own with Tuna on brown rice with corn onion lettuce avocado and spicy sauce. 

We will likely try it again to practice our ordering skills."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh every time! The staff is always super friendly and willing to give suggestions. I also like the variety of options as well. Try the Hawaiian tuna you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Super good. I thought I was back in Kona. We drove 10 miles and it was worth it. The premises were pristine but we were there for the food not the ambiance."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Poke place in the area. Their selection is amazing and their protein is so fresh and flavorful. The staff is really nice and helpful and takes the time to explain different options if you're wanting to try something new or want flavor recommendations. I'll definitely be back more!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and great customer service as well. It was my husband's first time and he's a poke fan now as well!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! Love this place! First off the food is amazing! So fresh and delicious. The staff is so friendly!! And they have a punch card!! Can't say enough good things about it. You have to go here!"}
{"text":"Recently moved from California and have missed my Poki bowls. So happy to find this place today for lunch. My husband and I both enjoyed the bowls very much.

Can't get enough of this place. We are becoming regulars. So many toppings available which makes the bowl extra tasty.
Staff are very nice too."}
{"text":"I'm a huge poke fan out of SLC. Found this gem and was not disappointed! Good price, good quantity, and great quality! I did all 4 tuna pokes and enjoyed each flavor profile. If you haven't had poke go here. If you had had poke and didn't like it, try it here! True Hawaiian style!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing so fresh and yummy.  Great selection of things to put in you poke bowl or rice and seaweed wrap. very clean. I always feel if a place can't clean their bathroom  nor can they clean their kitchen well the bathroom. Not to worry theirs was sparkling clean. It a lunch type of place quick, healthy and easy AND YUMMY!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very clean establishment. Super friendly staff. Had the Bulgogi since I'm not into Poke. It was excellent. Since it was my first time here the staff recommended some cut-ins and they were spot on. My Bulgogi bowl was delicious. I will be back again for another great meal."}
{"text":"Poke Hale is hands down the best Poke experience in the East Valley that I have found. Their ingredients are super fresh, and the staff is always welcoming. 5 stars all around, have visited over 10 times now and each is consistent with the last."}
{"text":"By far one of the best poke place in AZ, place is super clean, food is all the best! Not going find a spot this great ever!"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE poke fan and with poke being the new trend places are popping up everywhere. I'm always open to trying new places and when I saw that this was opening - I kept my eye on it. We went the weekend they were open and haven't stopped since. The poke has amazing flavor and as fresh as you can get. Its hard to explain but once you try Poke Hale you won't go anywhere else. The staff is always super friendly and welcoming. When putting they bowls together they actually make it look nice versus the other places that just slap the toppings on. The shop is immaculately clean with a great ambiance. We go at least once a week and love it!"}
{"text":"Yummy ! Perfect for AZ I can't wait to have it on a hot summer day! House spicy no rice is the best!"}
{"text":"Never had a poke bowl before and I'm super impressed. Service was great, people were cool, but most importantly the food was delish! It's fresh, crisp and super refreshing. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm a huuuuge jerk! I showed up at 6 past 8 and was definitely well past closing time, however the amazing staff served me anyway! I ordered a poke burrito and my husband ordered the bowl. The sides and sauces were incredibly varied. We were very pleased with our options! I also was very impressed with the heat of their Korean Spicy sauce...like, no, seriously, my mouth hurts and my eyes are leaking! It's great!! Their fish is very fresh-tasting and they didn't use subpar tuna for the spicy tuna because it's the same quality as their regular tuna and I can tell because they didn't shred it to hide the quality like other poke/sushi restaurants! The rice is fluffy and sticky; not mushy! Absolute perfection!! The servings were very generous. In fact I tried really hard not to eat my whole burrito but I couldn't help myself! I seemed to have lost my willpower to the delicious spicy heat of my poke burrito!!!

Thank you so much!! You guys are the bees knees!!"}
{"text":"If you are a poke fan you must try this new place.  Big chucks of fish and healthy choice of fresh ingredients.  I will be a patron for a very long time!"}
{"text":"This is literally the best poke place EVER. The ingredients are always fresh, and they are never stingy with their portion sizes. What makes Poke Hale even better (but also dangerous) is that the bowls are reasonably priced - other places tend to skimp on toppings yet charge an arm and a leg! Lastly, I appreciate how friendly the staff is. So excited to have found this place!"}
{"text":"Was on this side of town so I decided to give this place a try. I'm a big Poke fan and was excited to try something new. Unfortunately overall it was just OK compared to the other place that I have frequented which is REALLY good. I actually noticed a few similarities (like the metal trays and bowls), wondering how long it's been here and if it's a knock off. One thing for sure, the food is not quite as good. I took my food to go so perhaps it might have been better if I stayed and ate it straight away. I'll give it one more try and see if they can earn a  star or two more."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out during lunch with a good friend.
LET'S JUST SAY I WAS PRETTY IMPRESSED!

I live near like four Poke places but decided to drive a little further to try this place out.

I got the build your own, tuna and salmon, half spring mix and white rice, with just about every topping possible, as for sauces I wanted the yuzu or ponzu, but they were out unfortunately, but their house sauce made up for it! I loved how much sauce they actually use to mix all my fish and topping in, most places skimp on it so there's no flavor really.
Also, I loved that they didn't skimp on the crab salad like most places do as well so I was definitely happy with my portion, bang for my buck!

My friend got the seared salmon bowl and they even seared it a little longer for him (he doesn't like raw fish) and he finished the whole thing, which was definitely a surprise to me! 

Only thing I would suggest is keeping side comments to themselves, my bowl was pretty packed with deliciousness, and the cashier said something like \"Wow, that's alot of food!\" I wasn't offended or anything but, if I was self conscious or something I might take it offensively, esp since nowadays our society has turned into a bunch of babies.

Anyways I will definitely be back... Probably once a week, haha they're going to be sick of seeing my face!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing - ly; fresh; flavorful; unique; affordable; plentiful and friendly!  I plan to return time and again!"}
{"text":"This is the only poké place I eat at. Staff is awesome, owners are awesome, food is fantastic! The specials are always on point and delicious.. never had anything bad to say about this place. Definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"I hate you guys.... Seriously you are a nightmare for my bank account. The food is amazing. Best Miso soup I have ever had. I can only go about 2 weeks at the most before I am back. This is the most inexpensive and amazing poke place ever :)"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite poke restaurant in the whole valley. It's a great place to grab poke on the go. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. They have a big assortment of fresh fish and toppings. Occasionally they have specials which include hot foods and limited availability fish that the owners were able to acquire.  The Hawaiian tuna is one of my favorite protein options when building a bowl. The spicy house sauce is so good, it's the right amount of spicy without being overwhelming. It goes well with all of the fish. I love the selection of toppings you can add to the bowls as well. The corn and the mango are excellent. The portion size is huge and it's always a very filling meal."}
{"text":"First time trying Poke Hale and it was all around a great experience. Good food, great customer service and perfect location."}
{"text":"When we walked in, the space was cool and bright.  There was already a line for lunch when it was before noon.  That was a good sign.  A friendly face greeted me and asked me what i would like.  It was my first time there and I appreciated the explanations.  There were a bunch of nice guys lined up to assemble my Poke all wearing smiles and the cool Poke Hale t-shirts.  My wife got white rice and spring mix.  I got the brown rice.  We went with the Hawaiian tuna and the Korean yellowtail for the proteins.  There were numerous sauces and toppings.  We got the house sauce and the spicy sauce.  They even had avocados with no extra charge.  All the bins were clean and shiny.  The food looked fresh and delicious.  They were constantly wiping down the working areas.  They took my choices and carefully assembled them.  
Person ahead of me had ordered seared salmon.  The torch came out and whooooosh.  It was a nice show.
We sat down at a clean bright table by the window.  The tuna was well marinated with good penetration of the flavors.  Not too salty.  The yellowtail had a nice gentle kick with just the right amount of acid and sweetness.  The spicy aioli was excellent.  It was well balanced with flavors of chili, wasabi and tang giving it depth that was delightful to the palate.  The toppings were all fresh and complemented the meal.  Before I knew it, I was at the bottom of the bowl savoring the last bite.
I always check out the restrooms and this one was clean and well stocked.  
My wife and I had a wonderful lunch.  We are coming back soon."}
{"text":"Best poke I've had!! Great price, awesome quality, friendly service, and good sized portions! I finally stopped by after work to try this place out after seeing some friends' posts on Instagram. The inside is very clean, modern, and overall a very nice ambiance. Their menu is easy to follow, and they also have preset bows to choose from if you wish. The fish looked and tasted very fresh and the price is good considering the quality and portion of your meal. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Super solid poke place. I like how they don't nickel and dime you like some places I've been to. They let u have as many sides/toppings as you want. Super good and fresh. The portion was a good size."}
{"text":"I frequent Poke Hale often for the Sushi Burritos. They're always fresh tasting, and pretty filling. I love the various toppings and and add-ins. You get so many textures and unique flavors in one bite! This is definitely my favorite poke place in the area!"}
{"text":"It was very exciting seeing a home grown business in Arizona. And to actually speak with the owner Daniel was a treat. We hadn't said out to get Poke, but we couldn't very well pass up the opportunity. The restaurant is super clean and has a very welcoming feel to it. The only thing I would change is how high the partition glass is between where you order and the Poke bar. Because depending on the time of day there's so much glare it is hard to see who's behind it and hence difficult to have a conversation.

I'll tell you what I was very very impressed about... this poke was SO FRESH! The fish just melted in my mouth and was seasoned to perfection! And they have so many options to add on from seaweed salad, masago, imitation crab, edamame, etc. It is such a large helping so I could not finish it in one sitting. Had the rest of next day and it still tasted good. Now I know where I can go to have my poke fix when I'm in the East Valley area. Shoots!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and for the price it's a great amount of food. I got the salmon and tuna bowl with everything"}
{"text":"I've had an Hawaiian Escape for lunch and dinner all in the same day! Yaasss I ate right near the beautiful ocean waves,  listening to the tropical music that thay they had playing on the Big screen! I was impressed on my first visit! It was like a real tropical experience! 

The food is AWESOME! Poke Hale is THAT BOMB that it had me commin' back for dinner after I just had it for lunch that same day!#2wice I've had it for lunch and dinner#Same day#2 different days#Not to mention others days for lunch! 

I always get the delicious California bowl which comes on a bed of warm sticky rice, 2 scoops of fresh crab and fresh advocado! I get a scoop of spicy crab and a scoop of regular crab! You also get to pick sides to go in it#I get fresh diced mango, corn, and scallions. They top it with a sweet yummy eel sauce and a creamy chilpotle like mayo! I get extra of both of the sauces#Sooo good! The crab is so FRESH and flavorful! I love it! The crab, advo, (short for advocado) and sides compliment the warm rice and sauces well! If you pick the bowl up, it's a heavy bowl! You get a lot of food for such a reasonable price! 

I love how they serve tropcial canned Hawaiian drinks in addition to the sodas. I've tried them all! Hahaha. They are trop-licious! I also love that the food so healthy, full of flavor,  and that you feel light after eating at Poke Hale! The staff is AWESOME! They are always friendly and always show excellent customer service! I will stay coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Not bad - dish I had made to order could have used more sauce.  And volume of food is not much considering the prices.  May go back but at the prices , makes me wonder when Sprouts is finally going to start selling standard poke items at their stores!"}
{"text":"We popped in to try this place, because we love Hawaiian Rice Bowls! Neal had KBBQ Bowl, I had Crab... OMGoodness! The guys really helped us with sauces and topping! Great place! We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Today was our first time trying Poke Hale and I'd have to agree with others that it's really good! My son, whom I'd like to call a Pokesnob told his dad over text message that this place is \"super good\". 

The portions were plenty and no skimping out on sides like they do other places! Flavors were on point! But I'd have to agree with my son that the crab salad, edamame, mango mixed with rice and house sauce is the best!  For my bowl, I pretty much mixed everything in just to get the different flavors. PokeHale did not disappoint.

Oh yeah, the owners were pleasant too!"}
{"text":"Fresh poke bowls. I could poke bowls every day!!! The restaurant is clean. The staff person helping me was very knowledgeable about the menu, and knew the ingredients of their marinades and sauces.

I got a 2-scoop Bowl. Poke Hale and Salmon over mixed greens, seaweed salad, Krab salad, masago, green onions, furikake, fried garlic, wasabi, pickled ginger, cucumber... a WHOLE lot of toppings!

And you can buy the sashimi by the pound to make your own bowls at home!!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch for the first time and it is incredible. Not only is the food completely fresh but the service is very friendly and inviting!! Will definitely be back in again"}
{"text":"Good poke and great customer service. The poke business is kicking into high gear so the competition is fierce. They are good but the main protein options are not as strong as their competition. Toppings are \"load them all on\" at no extra charge. Drinks canned only but they are Hawaiian staple drinks."}
{"text":"I eat there 3-4 times a week, delicious!! Very fresh and people are very friendly, greet my by my first name..."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. More people need to discover this poke place. My wife got a burrito and I got a bowl. Both tasted very fresh and the staff was very helpful when making choices. We will be coming back to this place often. Already told others to go try it"}
{"text":"We love this place and will be back for sure. The staff was super helpful and nice. They even let us do tasters of the food so we knew we liked it before choosing it. The flavors were great and fish was super fresh."}
{"text":"They have Limu poke, Taco Poke, and their ono Hawaiian special poke...Cheeeee how legit is this - too good to be true right! lol
When I saw their advertisement on Instagram \"Phxnightmarket\" and they had a picture of someone holding our actual poke from what I call \"the origin of poke -Hawaiian\" My jaws dropped, my eyes was glued, and I stopped driving in the middle of traffic in Biltmore area on my way home. LoL  I couldn't believe it - was it really our poke and messaged the business asking \"is that really the real deal poke and not no chipotle poke?\" lol....I'm still not liking that concept but, as the owner puts it when I picked up my husband and drove straight to Poke Hale. He said \" This side pays for my rent?lol - with my face like - what is this??\" and then he said \"And this is your side \"Limu Poke and Hawaiian Special Poke\" now that side I like the best...lol..My smile was grinning cheek to cheek - ready to attack..Lol
I also love how they spell the name correctly and they have in parentheses of how it supposed to sound! Lol. It's not Poki, it's POKE (PO-Kay) - means cut in cube size and not no tiny sushi style sizes!\" 
There pieces of cut are exactly how it should be cut - not to big, not to small but, juuuusst right! 
What I love about this place is I can buy just the poke if I want - half pound or by the pound and there fish was fresh - not exactly like fresh from the sea but, their quality of fish is fresh. I love my fish and it's something I miss having on hand everyday - usually, we drive to Las Vegas and hit up Henderson on our way back to pick up because there is \"NO, place that sells it here in Arizona\" unless you come my house and we make our own...lol! But, besides this place and certain Costco location (Scottsdale) - Costco sometimes it's a hit and miss though, doesn't always fly up here fresh and my stomach starts turning on the first bite - and I gotta throw the whole thing away - AUWE (No can)! lol
It was funny though - everyone so used to getting the small scoop, rice, and adding their stuff on it...We told the clerk - K, we like half pound poke on the rice but, before you put the poke on the rice -drizzle some furikake, sriracha, and teri sauce first and then add the poke. She likes \"Half pound?\" lol, yep! Usually, we get 1 pound poke on top but, we ended up buying another half pound of poke.  Was sooo good! 
Now, that I know this place exist - it'll be my go to pick up for pupu's or just cause! lol
They also have other meats like bulgogi, spam musubi, and other meat dishes for people who are not acquired to the fish. I haven't tried their meat's yet but, there menu looks delicious like I could literally sit in the restaurant all day just to eat! lol
Everyone in there are so nice, friendly, FUNNY, and understand exactly what I was looking for! Mahalo for making some ono poke in the desert, I appreciate you guys for doing this, and making your mea'ai (meals) on point! You guys rock and I'm a huge fan..."}
{"text":"Wow!  Finally a poke place here!  So delicious... I got the mixed bowl with spicy house sauce...."}
{"text":"I love poke and this place did not disappoint.. Hawaiian style poke!! 

On today's visit I had the build your own poke bowl..  started with the 1/2 brown rice, 1/2 spring mix and Hawaiian Limu tuna and regular tuna (cubed in nice bite size pieces), loaded up in toppings including edamame, crab salad and masaga and their spicy house sauce (not very spicy).. nice light coat of sauce!! 

They do have items on the menu you can pick if you're not comfortable building your own bowl. They also have beef and other hot food options.

Staff is super friendly and don't judge me but the guys here are hotties!! 

I will definitely be back.."}
{"text":"I was really hoping Poke Hale would be a good place because it is on my way home and drive by it every day. Upon entering, the counter is uninviting and somewhat confusing. 

I was disappointed with the selection of fish and toppings. As other Yelpers write, they have some cooked bowls and other options most Poke places do not offer. Perhaps those are the dishes I should try out. But for Poke, this is not my choice."}
{"text":"Great poke place! The food is fresh and flavorful. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly. Definitely our family's top places to eat for fresh, reasonably priced poke!"}
{"text":"Light and fresh.  I'm not normally a fan of salmon, but the salmon and tuna were both delicious.  Really enjoyed the sauce and how it blended together.  I don't know what real poke is supposed to taste like, but it doesn't matter.  This place was delicious.  

My only quibble is that they gave me too much rice.  More toppings, less rice."}
{"text":"Best poke place in the valley for sure! Staff are pretty dope too !  highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Poke places are popping up left and right. This place in my opinion is the best I've been to. I grew up in Hawaii on Oahu and the Big Island, so my love of Poke runs deep. While most of the places are similar, the quality of ingredients here seems to be the best. I ordered a bowl with almost all the ingredients. The Hawaiian marinated tuna is my favorite of the proteins. The seaweed salad tasted very fresh and flavorful. The masago wasn't fishy at all like it is at some of the competitors. All around great place. Friendly staff and very clean restaurant. They also have a punch card, so if you eat as much Poke as I do, grab one!"}
{"text":"Was heading over to Cafe Zupas but saw Poke Hale next door. So I decided to give it a whirl, and I am so thankful I did. My poke bowl was insanely good.....just so clean and fresh, left my palate happy! Along with that, the staff was wonderful! I will be a return customer over and over."}
{"text":"I am so happy that there's a Poke place that I can go with my friends to now. Since I am not a fan of raw fish I usually have to skip the Poke Bowls but Poke Hale has a bulgogi Bowl option! 

Bulgogi with crab and house sauce was SO GOOD. They also give A LOT of food. Everyone who works there is super nice and accommodating. They also don't skimp on the avocado .

Clean with a pretty minimalist design and delicious food! It's pretty much like a chipotle for Poke Bowls - you build your own bowl with only food that you like. 

Come for the meals, stay for the males"}
{"text":"This is my visit to any Poke place ever. So, I was little skeptic as I was not sure of what to expect. I created my own poke rice bowl with one scoop each of spicy tuna and Hawaiian, sauce, mix of veggies, spicy crab and fried crispy onions. It turned out to be super delicious lunch. , I will go back again."}
{"text":"This is The best poke place. Everything is so fresh!
There is a large selection of sides/mix ins and they change out their seafood specials often. Everything we have tried has been fantastic and served with a smile."}
{"text":"This place hit the spot. We were craving Poke, we got it and more. Good flavor, generous portions, great service."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite poke places. The fish is very fresh and the atmosphere is typical for a poke restaurant.  Staff here is friendly, fun and very customer oriented. I come here often. Have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUCH, high quality and priced nicely for how much you get and the owner is so nice and lovely! highly recommend if you're interested in getting poke that is similar to Hawaii's."}
{"text":"By far the best Poke place. We frequent here.  They always have the freshest protein and a good selection. You can never go wrong with the \"special\" protein they have. The choices to make different bowls every time you visit is unlimited. And to top it off the owners/staff are super friendly.  They are always so welcoming, they will give you a sample if you just aren't sure or want to try something new, and are always coming up with creative menu items.   If you haven't visited you must.  This Poke establishment is the BEST!!"}
{"text":"If you love sushi you will love the bowl. Poke is not very big small inside. It was clean. Server remembered my son from the night before.. I had the Cali bowl it looked as good as it tasted . I was surprised at how good these bowls were . Definitely check them out . We will be back !!!!"}
{"text":"Best Poke bowl I've had in Arizona. Great toppings and everything was so fresh! Will be back to try the Burrito and Bulgogi!"}
{"text":"So I just demolished my poke bowl..well I saved a couple bites for later. It was my first visit and definitely not my last. 

I'll start with the place, very nice and clean. Staff was awesome and very engaging. Got to talk with one of the chefs who is from Hawaii. I love seeing locals thrive in the mainland because I know first hand (being from HI) how hard it is living and making it in Hawaii. So having a bright future and doing big things in a big place is just amazing. I'll go back to support locals just for that reason. 

I got a bowl, white rice with the Hawaiian and spicy tuna. Added seaweed salad and had spicy sauce on it. The flavors hit the spot and the portions are big. The fact that they don't charge extra for everything is a plus! Did I mention that they have a punch card?! Yes, buy 10 get one free. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear a new poke restaurant was opening by my house, I had to go check it out. I got there right at 11 and the place was clean and the food looked fresh and everything was ready to go. The containers are the first thing I noticed about the poke bowls. Finally somewhere with bigger containers so I don't feel like all my food is falling out every time I try to mix my bowl. The portions are great, price was good, my bowl was awesome, fish was fresh. Can't complain here! This is a great location and I'll definitely be back often!"}
{"text":"Easily the best Poke in AZ. Their burritos are even good, unlike other places that just add more rice to a roll and call it a burrito. Poke Hale actually over stuffs theirs with whatever you want and then use just the right amount of rice."}
