{"text":"I would've given this restaurant 0 stars, but was unable to do so, thus 1 star is being generous. Aside from the service being subpar, the food is comparable to prison. After ordering buffalo chicken dip, we had decided to play \"first person to find any chicken in this wind a dollar.\" To no surprise, there wasn't even a crumb of chicken lingering within the overly sauced dip. Seems like these franchise's are hurting for business. The waitress was nice and did drop off some diced up chicken to add to our cheese dip.."}
{"text":"One of the most popular Sunday Brunch spots in the city, especially in the SouthSide. To be honest the only thing that keeps me coming back is the $8.50 pitcher of mimosa deal they offer. Most brunch places charge about $8 for a single champagne glass size mimosa, but Local offers you an entire pitcher (About 6 glasses) for $8.50

The food is decent at best to be honest, you won't get the best or worst meal of your life."}
{"text":"I ordered what was supposed to be buffalo chicken dip and it was the consistency of mashed potatoes with about three pieces of shredded chicken present. I'm pretty sure it was just a mixture of cream cheese and buffalo sauce. Never order their dip."}
{"text":"I've taken my fair share of trips to Local over the years, weekend brunches, dinners, and some late nights here and then. Have never had a horrible experience, though can say I've never had a great one either. Service/food/prices are all average and never felt the need to leave a review. That is until this past weekend. I don't go out weekend nights in south side as I'm not a fan of the immature crowd, but it was a friends birthday so decided to go along. It was 2 am and the bar was closing, so I understand the staff is tired and wants everyone out so may yell some disrespectful things to get the people moving. But for a bouncer to aggressively push me from behind while I'm already ready walking towards the door is completely uncalled for.  There was no altercation prior to this, lights came on, I waited for my friend to go bathroom, then we headed out while trying to book an uber. While leaving the staff acted like herder dogs funneling everyone to the door. The was when the bouncer pushed me from behind and through me out the door. Completely uncalled for and a reason for me to never return to this establishment"}
{"text":"Food here is only decent. My big complaint was about the waitress.  She was not very accommodating and even told us we lost our table before our reservation time! How does that make any sense?!  The food was also just normal bar food. Nothing special. The only good thing about this bar is the rooftop."}
{"text":"This place rocks and Erin is the best bartender in Pittsburgh!!!"}
{"text":"The food at Local is SUPER awesome, and was a very fun experience.  Just be ready to battle the South Side crowd... :)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and had a delicious roasted asparagus salad. The pretzel appetizer was good, but the queso that came with it was too firm and not very good for dipping. Nice service though and who knows you may even see a Dance Mom in there! (They have filmed at Local)"}
{"text":"The draw of local is the location and wonderful open windows in the summer. If you can get a seat near one, it's a great place to drink and people watch. The food is pretty good - standard bar food. The upstairs deck is great - TVs and decent specials during happy hour (seems like domestics are half off and that's about it). Yinz-a-Rita's are great :)"}
{"text":"Like the ambience but their drinks aren't good, I mean the cocktails. Even a basic mojito isn't good. Just go their for the ambience in the summer."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went down to Local to get lunch and watch the Penn State/ Northwestern game a few weeks ago. We had been to Local plenty of times at night for drinks but had never tried their food for a sit down restaurant experience. As far as decor and vibes, Local is a cool, upbeat place to eat and drink and enjoy the South Side atmosphere. However, the food and service is what disappointed us.

We ordered: Buffalo Chicken Sand which (sub provolone for Swiss) with sweet potato fries and a buffalo chicken salad. We received a very small salad with plain ice burg lettuce, onion, tomato, and chicken. Keep in mind that the salad was listed for about 9 dollars. The sandwich that came had absolutely no buffalo sauce and instead of the sweet potato fries I ordered, I was given regular fries that were definitely cheap store bought frozen fries. 

Overall, the food and service was a disappointment. A waitress should be able to deliver the correct order to the kitchen and make sure it is up to par. After bringing out our food, we didn't see her until she brought the check!

Bottom line: Go to Local for drinks. If you want lunch, check out The Library further down East Carson Street in the South Side."}
{"text":"Great deck and location. But one waitress for at least 15 tables = awfully slow service."}
{"text":"One star is for good drinks   Food was very disappointing.  Scarcely any beef on philly cheese steak. Hamburger toppings not as described.  Soggy chips"}
{"text":"Legitimately one of the worst meals in Pittsburgh. I live very close and go more often than I should given the quality of the food, but they do have some great drink specials. Somehow it turns out that I'll go there for happy hour and end up ordering something when people I'm with do.

If you want to just hang out and have a few beers, it's good for that. But you do not want the food there. Here is what I have gotten and the quality of each meal:

Apps:
- Buffalo Chicken Mac and Cheese - Honestly the only thing I've enjoyed there. Pretty good. However, a little goes a long way.

- Pot Roast Nachos - Legitimately looks like a child made them. They dump a ton of tortilla chips onto a large plate, and then cover the middle with meat, scallions, jalapenos, sour cream and tomatoes with some cheese on top. The problem is that all of the chips that don't happen to be directly in the middle of the plate are neglected. If you want about 10 loaded tortilla chips and 50 plain chips, this is your meal!

- Chicken Quesadilla - The only reason I didn't send it back was because we went at Happy Hour, so it was half off. This was laughably bad. I took a bite and realized it was extremely bland. I opened it up, only to realize that my \"chicken quesadilla\" was legitimately a half-empty tortilla with a single cube of chicken, no more than 10 bits of shredded cheese, and a few scallions. If you're on a strictly carb diet and don't want what you order, this is your meal!

- Spinach Artichoke Dip - If I had to guess the recipe, I'd say it was 10 parts sour cream, a few pieces of sliced spinach, a half of an artichoke chopped into four pieces and some chips on the side. As hard as it is to believe, the presentation is even better - a solid mix of vomit and chowder!


\"Meals\":
- The salads aren't too bad, but keep in mind you're spending 13 dollars for an average-sized salad

- Flat Bread Pizzas - Much like the quesadillas, if you want a lot of dough, with bland, limited ingredients, this could be your go-to pizza place!

- Pot Roast Grilled Cheese - If I'm honest, the grilled cheese itself wasn't bad. That being said, it's not worth adding any meat onto the sandwich. They barely put any on and it's all concentrated in one area. They serve it with gazpacho, however, which I'm not convinced wasn't just crappy salsa with V8 dumped inside.

- Brisket Sandwich - This is supposed to be one of the \"best\" things on their menu and it's decidedly average. Good for them

- The burgers aren't too bad. That being said, you'd be better off going to Wingharts a few doors down for about the same price.

- The fries are pretty bland, and I fully recommend staying away from the sweet potato fries. Tasted like they had left them in the refrigerator overnight with a bag of ground cinnamon. Unbelievably bad.


In all honesty, this place has very good drink specials and the waitresses are friendly. Service is decent, but the food is atrocious. You're far better off going elsewhere. Mario's is decent, but nothing special. Winghart's is better food with a pretty dull atmosphere. The Smiling Moose is heads and shoulders above this place. Carson City Saloon is what I imagine this place would like to be given similar drink specials and significantly better bar food along with a much better sports bar experience if that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"This needs to treat all customers fairly and not just a few and never prejudge anyone based on skin color that is all"}
{"text":"Great place to drank and then eat (drank) away your hangover the next day. Whether going at night or during the day, the outdoor atmosphere helps you to forget that you're in such a horrible city. The hostess/waitress was obviously a hung over mess and could have used a tune up. BUT, she did pull through (probably by puking up her last night's marg in the toilet) and did remember our order. She was attentive, and brought our food quickly. The 21oz. goblet of bloodies are too die for - and six doll hairs! Can't wait to get my little claws on the Yinzerita. We were blown asunder by the bodacious, bountiful breakfasts. The omelets and banana stuffed francais toast are highly recommended. My only gripe is the soggy white bread served with the meal - whole grain, duh!  Definitely my new fav."}
{"text":"Have been here so many times before and the foods usually good. But this Sunday was anything but good when it came to the food. Our buffalo chicken dip appetizer was missing the chicken?? Just ranch, hot sauce, and cream cheese. Not cool. My burger which I ordered medium rare was cooked well. I'm talking so tuff it was a hard as a hockey puck. And the mimosa were all OJ. Atmosphere is good but I'll stick to just drinking here from now on."}
{"text":"Came for Saturday brunch with a friend for the $8 mimosa carafe--can't go wrong with that deal. I was a little wary at first though cause of the mixed reviews on the food, but I'm SO glad we ended up here. I had the Eggs Benedict and my friend had the vegetable omelet. Both dishes were amazing. There was a little kick to the hollandaise that I liked. Our server was good and the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Service at local was excellent and friendly. The eggs Benedict was amazing and had a nice take with the asparagus and potato pancake addition. Excellent home fries with red peppers and onion. Would definitely recommend and go again."}
{"text":"Ordered the smoked chicken nachos. It was a plate of out of the bag chips with about a teaspoon of shredded cheese, sour cream, chicken, and two slices of jalapeños. For this I was charged $11"}
{"text":"Came here for bar food, beer and the world series. The atmosphere was nice until and relaxed until late, which got to be a little bit much around 10:45p. The fact that it was Halloween was probably the driving factor behind that. 

When I got there and sat at the bar, it took about 15 minutes before the bartender came over to me. There was only one working when I got there. When a second bartender came on about 30 minutes later, the service improved. They were friendly, but a little bit on the slow side, which was surprising because it wasn't too busy when I got there. 

Food was decent. I had the smoke ribs. They fell off the bone but seemed like they were a bit overcooked. Came with a coleslaw that I enjoyed and I don't usually like cole slaw. Beer selection was mainly IPA heavy and seasonal beers. Not much variety outside of that. 

I'd go back, but I don't know if I would stay as late as I did this time."}
{"text":"Local Bar is one of the best bars on East Carson Street!!

Just bought a condo on the south-side so I visit Local pretty often! This place has great food. (BEST WINGS IN THE CITY) Great brunch and fantastic drinks!

If you ever go make sure you get the server named JOE!! He's absolutely the best. His Customer Service skills and friendliness make him stand out among the other servers. 

PS. If you love CIDER!! This is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Saturday. Ordered a classic burger. It was home made and grilled just as ordered it. Great taste and the chips were nice too. Good service, but a little too loud music for my taste."}
{"text":"I didn't eat here but we stopped in for a drink on a tuesday night. Service was good and quick and the beer selection was amazing. There were to many choices so it was hard to make up my mind. I like the openness of the place with the open front and deck upstairs."}
{"text":"Best thing about this place is how it opens up and you can sit along the edge of the restaurant and feel like you're outside. 

As for the food, it was OK, nothing to write home about. I had a flatbread which again, was slightly bland, but was still cheese on bread so I couldn't be that disappointed!

If you like wine, go on a Wednesday, there's half-price wine all night and you get a free bottle if you make a reservation. 

I found this place to be just generally underwhelming. I didn't have a bad experience or bad time at all, it just didn't make much of an impression."}
{"text":"This place is under-rated.  The 3 of 5 is due to the servers not being very friendly or attentive.  The food was very good to excellent for the price.  The Mahi was as fresh as we get in South Florida.  Burgers great and the pot roast nachos were a plus plus.  Better service and this place scores a four."}
{"text":"Ok.....I am past the college bar scene by  a few years so I can only talk about the Kitchen part of LOCAL.

Went to Local with a friend on a Sunday evening.   It was full, but not crowded.  I was diapointed that we didn't get a seat in the cool, full open to the street front but, our table was good.   The early Sunday crowd was a mix of ages and background so we did NOT feel like we were creepers in a kid's bar.

Uncommonly, I ordered linguini and meatballs.   Friend ordered chicken diablo.   Both  were geat and prepared as they should be.   The tomato basil suce was fantasitic.....tasted like tomatoes, basil garlic, and other good stuff!   Chicken was spicey but not crazy hot like some diablos.

Sevice was quick and friendly.   Beer selection was a little limited, but I found something tasty.

I can give this a cautionary recommendation.........I wouldn't go in if it is prime bar time and crowded.  Save it for another time.  (The same caution goes for FATHEADS too!)"}
{"text":"Went on a rainy Saturday around 1 PM and the place was fairly crowded. There were no seats at the first floor bar, but the hostess said we could try the bar on the patio upstairs. After grabbing some stools from nearby tables, we had our space at the upstairs bar. The place was nice, with that trendy, exposed brick kinda look and a \"roof\" that was pretty high up giving the patio a nice, big - almost outdoor - feel. The \"roof\", however, was not really intended to keep all of the elements out as there were a number of leaks around the room, including one behind the bar causing the bartender to put on a garbage bag, \"Steeler Game style\", to stay dry. It was near the end of brunch and there was a Bloody Mary Bar set up, though I didn't see anyone partaking. Carafes of mimosas, though, were being poured at what had to be a record pace.  

My friend and I each ordered a beer from their nice beer selection while we decided what to eat. Both of us concluded that basic cheeseburgers were in order. Basic is the best description for what we received. It was good, but nothing special, done to nearly the temperature ordered (which is far better than many other places, including those who have burger in their names!) on a great tasting, very fresh bun. It was well worth the price. The  house-made chips were tasty, but a little soggy from the frying oil. The service was fine, but the music was so loud that my friend and I were having a difficult time hearing each other.

I will definitely go back again, but next time I'll be ordering some mimosas!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this spot, which is in a good location and has a wonderful deck.  Sadly, the wonderful ended there.  I've been there twice now, first on a weekend for drinks, where the bartender was chatting with a waitress while people waved and shouted for drinks.  I thought I would try a more quiet night for the second trip and went in mid week, to sit on the deck and eat dinner.  

Despite the nearly empty restaurant, service was very slow, and never visible except when delivering food.  We ordered a few beers, two steaks and a sandwich.  The food took a little too long to arrive and with it came the news that Local doesn't have steak knives. \"They've been on order for weeks.\" the server offered,  The butter knife will cut it,it's just real slow.\"  Really?  A functioning restaurant in Pittsburgh and no one can take the time to stop by a restaurant supply store and pick up something basic like steak knives?  Doesn't speak well of the management.

Both steaks were ordered medium rare, one arrived rare, the other was completely well done & grey to the center.  The sandwich had obviously been made when the order was first put in, as the top of the bread was rock hard from the heat lamp, and the cheese had leaked out onto the plate and congealed.   The \"salad\" that came with it was a handful of iceberg lettuce with a single, sad tomato wedge on top.

The whole thing is really a shame, as the location is good, and the rooftop deck is great. (and has an awesome huge fan in the middle of it)  With a chef that cannot control their kitchen enough to make sandwiches properly and management that runs for weeks without silverware, this place sadly, has no chance.  In a competitive area like the South Side, there's too much good stuff around to waste more time at Local."}
{"text":"I was at Local South Side for a party of 10 people on Friday (Jan 5) at 6PM.  There was no heat in the  1st floor of the restaurant despite there being vents and a fireplace (nothing was turned on).  The temp on the thermostat was 44 degrees.  When we talked to the staff (who were bundled up), they said it is always that cold.  My group wore our coats (and gloves!) at the table just to stay warm. 

On the positive side, the food wasn't that bad but the temperature caused us to leave earlier than we wanted.  Turning on (or fixing) the heat should be a priority - I would not recommend the place without it."}
{"text":"Do NOT go here for brunch on Sunday.  It was an uncoordinated disaster.  They messed up our reservation and really had a bad attitude about their mistake.  We asked the bartender for a beer list and he pointed at the chalkboard without speaking and walked away.  Our waitress told us she just woke up and didn't have it together yet.  She was right, she was unprepared to come to work and it showed.  The brunch food was adequate at best.

The beer selection was great, so that's why it's 2 stars and not 1.  I would consider going back for dinner when they might have their A team working."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place, especially because I knew they had rooftop seating. Of course, the roof was closed for lunch. We got the steelworkers' burger - omg, please don't do it. It was way overcooked (asked for medium, it was grey, burnt) and just a greasy, battered, yucky mess. The spinach artichoke dip was also an orange grease pooled mess with very little actual dip for the price. 

This place seemed like it was geared toward the drunken, stumbling South Side late night crowd who just want ANYTHING to put in their bellies during a night of drinking. And that's cool.  I appreciate places like this at 1am when i need just anything......But don't stop here if you are looking for a decent meal. 

Unfortunately, bar food at it's worst. And I LOVE bar food..."}
{"text":"Cool southside spot. Food was good, great beer selection, atmosphere was a trendy pub, but they really need to turn on the heat. I was so cold at lunchtime I couldn't enjoy my meal.  Luckily I had a Groupon and didn't pay full price.  Might be a better spot to drink or go during the summer."}
{"text":"Stopped in a for a qu;ick bite on a Thursday evening.  Ate at the bar where the bartenders were very friendly and attentive.  Beer selection was decent, but they were out of the my 1st two choices (all of Pittsburgh appeared to be out of SA Octoberfest).  Ended up with a SA Pumpkin beer which came with a spiced rimmed glass, nice touch.  

Food was decent, pulled pork sandwich with side of asparagus.  Sandwich was really good, but the asparagus were minature.

Overall, appeared to be a solid spot and would go back next time in Pitt."}
{"text":"The wings were good and crispy, could have been more saucy for my liking. The flatbread was over cooked/burnt.  The smoked chicken nachos were okay, the cheese was a little gritty though. Maybe it will be better, if there's a next time."}
{"text":"They recently redid the rooftop and it looks great. Their brunch food is subpar - nothing bad, just nothing incredible either. Now that bottomless mimosas are illegal (life ending travesty), we enjoy the alternate option of ordering a carafe of juice and a carafe of champagne - although we all know we'll need a few carafes of champagne to drink that much juice :)

I prefer to day drink here over nighttime adventures - but either way, it usually goes well."}
{"text":"Blahhhhh..,, waited 30 min for our food and we were here here at 4pm on non peak hours No one had ordered any food. I finally reminded the bartender we ordered 35 min ago and a las, our food arrived cold and cardboard like. Don't ever go here to eat , ever period!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This review is just for Local's food.  Generally, I think Local's food is pretty decent.  As far as lunch and dinner go, I have usually only ordered salads.  I recently (and often) have the salmon salad, which is great with the additions of asparagus and roasted red peppers.  The horseradish dressing is really delicious.

This past weekend I went there for brunch.  It had been awhile since I had been there for brunch, and it was a pretty reasonable experience.  I had a southwestern omelette which was accompanied with \"brunch potatoes\" and toast (though I eschewed the toast).  My friend and I both ordered the \"bottomless mimosas\" for $14.  

The last time I went to Local for brunch I didn't find the \"bottomless mimosas\" to be very good, but this time they definitely had stepped up their game.  Our waitress was very diligent in refilling our glasses, as well.

The southwestern omelette was very tasty and done well.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and all the interior ingredients were cooked well, too.  It was a good brunch/breakfast meal.  I'd recommend it to friends.

The only reasons I'm not giving Local more stars is because I think the food is good but not spectacular, and I always feel like it's kind of dirty in there.  I get that it's a bar, but it seems kind of dirty in there sometimes.  For meals it doesn't get too crazy-crowded though.  Generally it's a good place to go out for food and drinks."}
{"text":"Aside from a place to have a beer ( that depending on the day of the week and time), the service, food, and atmosphere of this spot is butt. I had one of the worst server experiences I can ever remember having here a few months ago. The food, I had a cobb salad and fries, they were truly and purely the definition of below average.

As a resident of the southside for about 3 years now, Local is the example of the type of places along Carson that exist to house frat and bro types, to get drunk quick with shots chased with a bud light. 

Only thing I do like about this place is the open air/ up stairs patio area in the summer (again depending on day of the week you go and time.) You can do better than this place ;)"}
{"text":"Waitress was nice. Drink specials good. Don't eat here.

Came for a late breakfast/early lunch. Ordered a simple chicken wrap (as did the rest of the Table).  Some came correct. Some came as sandwiches. Sent mine back. It came back with the wrong sauce and wrong ingredients. Sent it back again.... Now going on over an hour later... My friend decided instead of waiting for her wrap, again, she would get hummus. So we waited for another half hour. They must have been growing the chic peas and crushing them to make the hummus. The hummus finally came. My wrap to follow. With no sauce. At this point, we asked the server for sauce on the side. She brought the sauce, but it was different than the person next to me who ordered the same exact sauce. We don't know still to this day whose wrap was correct. 
Anyway, after being incorrect 3 times. There was no compensation. Everyone at the table was done eating and I was no longer hungry. 

What a waste of time. Should have went to urban tap. 

Would not go back unless it's for drinks."}
{"text":"Food is good, cheap.  Normal bar drinks, typical Pittsburgh bar"}
{"text":"Food was very late and the sandwich smelled of sewer. The wait staff was nice and comped the food. Overall if you want this atmosphere, Fatheads is a better choice."}
{"text":"If you are sitting at the upstairs bar and the heat is on, BEWARE! My gf and I went to brunch there and she noticed there was dirt on my face, which caused us to notice that there was dirt on BOTH of our hands from the bar. When I asked the bartender for a towel, she gave me a very black, originally white, wet towel to wipe off my area. The wet towel was so disgustingly dirty. I went downstairs to wash my hands and showed the manager my hands. He said it was from the heaters from the ceiling leaking soot. He didn't really even offer an apology or give us any type of discount.  Dirty bar, mediocre food. Never going again."}
{"text":"This burger and beer joint also offers great salads! So you can eat healthy- loved the grilled salmon salad, or be slightly bad- burgers and beer. Pizza too! 
We stumbled on this place when another close by restaurant was overcrowded with a wait. We've returned to Local a dozen times and always pass the other restaurant. Nice trendy industrial decor, nice menu, comfy leather booth seating was added recently and a great improvement."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my family today. Best French toast I've ever had! Very fluffy with a slight vanilla flavor. Would love to come back for the Bloody Mary bar, it seemed to be a hit!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. I just didn't love my experience here on a Sunday. Maybe I'm too old."}
{"text":"A great spot for our Friday night date night. We were seated right away at a table by the window. It was still happy hour and most drafts were half off. I tried e Shocktop Twisted Pretzel (kinda watery and flavorless) and my go to Leinenkugel Cranberry Ginge Shandy. My fiancé had the Strongbow cider. Select apps were half off and we got the pretzel sticks and pierogies. Both were fabulous and left us too full for dinner. The pretzels are served with honey mustard and cheese. The pieogies have sauerkraut, kielbasa and onions on them topped with sour cream.  We put in a to go order for our entrees and got a side salad, boneless wings and a flatbread pizza. The takeout did not stay good for long so  it would have been best to have just eaten the dinner there. Our fantastic waitress, Amanda, talked us into the pretzel brownie which was to die for - a fudge brownie with whipped cream, chocolate sauce and crushed up pretzels.  A great dinner and we will be sure to be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a Saturday evening and was seated right away. Between my friend and I we had the Yinzer brisket sandwich, a side salad, a side of mac & cheese, onion rings and the triple decker Reuben. Everything was delicious and surprisingly not heavy and greasy. My only complaint is that the place is sort of dark and doesn't seem to be the cleanest in the world - like maybe if the lights on it would look much less inviting. Otherwise, good food and good prices!"}
{"text":"I'd only give it one if I didn't frequent here so often because of the large operable windows that make the place great to hang out and have a few beers one a nice afternoon or evening.  If your only going for a lite beer on a nice evening, you can't go anywhere better.

Most of the bar staff is super, except for the one rude waitress that laughed when I asked for a Harp on St. Patrick's Day last year. \"I'm not going to order a case of Harp that nobody will drink and go bad!\"  Last time I checked a lot of people enjoy Harp and all Guinness products especially on St. Patrick's day.

It took awhile, but the place finally has a decent beer selection (not great).  I would only suggest ordering beer here because the the wine selection is terrible and the mixed drinks are the worst on the Southside.  My guess is the ownership monitors the bartender's pours because they are always too weak.  And by weak I mean you may as well just order a tonic water instead of an G&T because all you're going to get is tonic water.  Recently they started wine night Wednesdays where you get 1/2 price bottles of wine.  When I was there recently on one of these nights I asked for a wine list, which they didn't have, so I asked for a bottle of Pinot Noir.  The wine was not corked or anything, but it was so bad tasting that I couldn't even finish half a glass.


The food isn't all that bad, but isn't anything special.  My only advice is to avoid the fish sandwich...it made me sick one time"}
{"text":"Their food and mimosas were great! Their mimosa carafe were only $8 and poured 9 glasses. I got their French toast with scrambled eggs and potatoes. I definitely recommend stopping here for their brunch on Saturday or Sunday! Great place!"}
{"text":"I was unaware it was possible to mess up a cheeseburger. I'm not sure what they put in the ground beef as the menu had no description but there were crunchy bits of something reminiscent of plastic throughout. I couldn't force myself to finish. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Why did you have to ruin Cain's?

Made it from pretty unique local place that was always busy to milk toast."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I have never wrote a review on this place. I love going here for their wings! When I'm in Pitt and want wings, hands down this is the place. I haven't honestly tried anything else but the beer and wings...lol; but hey, give me time, maybe I will. Remember, to order good wings, always always always ask for Xtra crispy! Hmmmmmmm, now I'm getting hungry for wings :)"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Sat at the bar. Bartender walked by half a dozen times without a nod or any acknowledgement. It wasn't super busy.  Left without ordering."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Made reservations for our dinner, since it was a Saturday night. We had never been, but were surprised it wasn't that busy. 

The 5 of us shared family style so that we could try everything. Pot roast nacho app was tasty but very skimpy on the toppings. Wish it would've have more on it. The Italian flatbread was just average.. wouldn't order that again. Grilled cheese was made w/ 4 cheeses but was bland & greasy. Thumbs down on that. The Mexican war street burger had guacamole and pico and we all enjoyed it. Sweet pot fries had cinn and sugar and were good!

The only thing I was really impressed by was the Reuben. It was delicious-- better than most other restaurants!! We all LOVED that one. 

Will prob be back to get that sandwich and try a few other things.."}
{"text":"Lily was our server and she was absolutely the worst server. We put in an order for food at 8:30 and did not receive it till 10. When we asked her an update on the food she said it's coming. We got a quesadilla, lets be real it doesn't take over an hour to make a quesadilla. What bothered me more was her attitude. She kept ignoring us when we tried to get her attention and when we finally got to ask her about it all she could say was its coming."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about Local! My sister turned 30 this week, and being the sister I am, I knew that we had to do it up in style. Local came through like a champ for this!!

I contacted Local about two months ago and asked about having a large group for dinner. Dana was amazing and so helpful. While most other places wanted to charge a fee upwards of $400 for a 2-3 hour party, Local simply asked that we make reservations and pre-select a menu. Dana offered us a big table in the newly enclosed deck upstairs (and included construction updates in a few of the emails we exchanged!) They gave us plenty of time to make the menu choices, let us bring our own cake, cupcakes, provided dishes for  dessert,  and even took the cake and cupcakes in the back, lit the candles, and brought it out from the kitchen for us. 

Earlier this week, my sister's roommate asked if we could order champagne for the table. I gave her Dana's contact info and we had an answer within a few hours, that yes, she could have that all set up. 

When we got to the restaurant last night, everything was set up and ready to go. The staff all knew that we were there for a birthday party and made a big deal for the birthday girl. Since we had already ordered, we had a little time to hang out and chat while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. The food was absolutely delicious. Some of the favorites from the table were the steak and chips (I think 5 of us ordered this, and it was melt in your mouth (literally) delicious!!), the aloha chicken, and the shrimp diablo.

The waitstaff who took care of us was amazing. Shannon and Matt were so friendly and fun! They offered to take pictures for us, took care of the cake, and were ever vigilant when drinks were running low. They even took the extra time to make sure that paying the check wasn't a hugely complicated process. This is the first time that I've been to a restaurant in a group this size and not have any mistakes on the bill. 

If you ever need a great place for a group/party/special night, go LOCAL!!"}
{"text":"LOVE coming here for brunch! You can't beat $8 carafe of mimosas!  The food is so good and the vibe is very laid back. Highly recommend checking out!"}
{"text":"Great service, strong knowledge of the 40+ craft brews on tap. Music slightly overbearing and trending toward trance/house at times for a bar that feels like it should be kings of Leon, etc."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but there is some guy in the bathroom asking for tips to wash your hands. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"One of my favorite rooftops in Pittsburgh! Great spot for a bit party and the staff there knows how to take care of a crowd. It's become one of my favorite haunts."}
{"text":"Hit this joint up last night with GrapeWife. We were seated quickly at one of the window tables looking out on Carson Street. Service followed quickly. Our drinks and pot roast nacho app were served timely. The pot roast nachos were delicious and did their job getting our appetites going. GrapeWife had a nice looking Cobb Salad that tasted as good as it looked. I got the Pittsburgh Pretzel. It is a kielbasa sandwich topped with cheese, kraut, mustard and a couple of pierogis. It was good and tasty. My only compliant is it reminded me of the old Wendy's \"Where's the beef?\" the tiny pice of kielbasa was dwarfed by the pretzel bun.

Local is a cool place with a cooler menu. Give it a try the next time you're looking for something different in the South Side."}
{"text":"So after a Happy Hour at Nakama my friend and I decided to head over to Local for some (a lot) adult beverages on the patio. 

We found a nice ledge to post up on. We chatted, people watched, and continued to drink. I ended up running into a lot of old friends which was a lot of fun! I don't know to credit the bar for the good time I had because I was in great company. 

The place can be a little douchey but what bar isn't these days. I don't let a couple ed hardy tees ruin my time. I saw a fair share of eye candy as well.  The scene was a bit diverse though(I got hit on by a bunch of 60 year old business men). Creepers transcend all generations. 

My Happy Hour ended up turning into a 2am night!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  It has a great beer list and when it is nice out (like it was yesterday when I was there) they even open the floor length windows on Carson St. I had a really yummy flatbread pizza - great size and came to the table piping hot.  My friends had wings which they enjoyed.  

This is a great place to go before heading across the street to the eccentric and cool Rex Theatre or when shopping the fun and independent shops of Southside.  Also a great place to stay for the night with TVs on sports everywhere in the bar/restaurant.  Upstairs is a open air roof deck, which is fun on nice nights."}
{"text":"I don't know, I really want to like this place but some things I can't get past. The people that sit you are very snooty. Last weekend I glanced at a reserved table and got yelled at by some little twit with a large forehead \"those are reserved!!!!\" I thought, good lord lady, it's not even 10am yet, use your inside voice and decided to sit at the bar so I didn't have to deal with her. I do like the look of the place and also like the mimosas.. I wouldn't order any eggs from this place if you like them over easy or over medium, the cook can't figure out how to cook the whites but leave the yellow. Two times this has happened, I couldn't even eat them, you could see the uncooked whites. Gross. Oh and I think the same guy that can't cook an egg white is also toasting the English muffins.. both times, they weren't toasted when I specifically asked for the food cooked the way I liked it. I didn't get it."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the big deal is...  

My friends and I went based on the recommendation of others and general talk about town on the 4th of July.  It was too hot to cook out.  The menu isn't very expansive.

I had the boneless wings with spicy thai sauce or something.  They were not spicy, nor thai, and were cooked way too hard.  My friend ordered a salad that was pretty decent and big so I ate half of it.

There was good music playing in the background and since I loooove to shake it, that was a positive.

I probably will only go back if someone I know is DYING to go there.  If you are hungry and thirsty and in the Southside, I guess this is one place you could go.  There are PLENTY of better places though.  Still not sure what the big deal is???"}
{"text":"I had heard that Local was not the kind of place I'd want to be on the weekends or late at night (rumors of frat boys, dbags everywhere), so I was sure to go on a week day for dinner.  At this time, the dining area was not busy and we had no wait to sit, although there were several other diners there.  Unfortunately the weather was crappy that day so no patio experience for us. 

The interior of Local is pretty nice looking.  I loved their menus (nerd) and seating arrangements.  Our service was quick and very friendly.  

I was inspired to order the Amazing Yoga Asparagus Salad with Salmon since it was named for my fave studio right across the street!  It was a filling salad with delicious grilled asparagus, other veggies and a bunch of goat cheese.  The salmon was cooked very nicely and I was impressed with the quality of the fish.  The best part of the salad, though, was the horsey vinaigrette.  Yum!  My husband got the cheeseburger with bacon (of course) and said it was \"good\".  So probably an average burger here.

Our waitress did make a mistake on our bill (charged for an extra beer that we ordered but they actually didn't have on tap), but when we brought it to her attention she was really apologetic and fixed it quickly and gave us both coupons for our next visit.  A little thing like that can really make a difference in your experience!

I was pleased with my meal at Local.  The service was good, the food was creative and tasty, and the atmosphere was nice (early on a weekday at least)."}
{"text":"Local Bar + Kitchen (henceforth referred to as \"the Local,\" or \"Local\") is a groovy place to dine and drink, friends. I was out and about one day with the old ball and chain. We were on our way to Carson Street Deli when we passed Local. It looked interesting. They had their sandwich board out that bragged about their cheap wing night. We made a note to go visit next time around.

So a short time passes, and I'm perusing the local deals on Groupon. Lo and behold, there's a dealio for $30 worth of food at the Local for a mere $19. Toss on an extra 20% off coupon and we're checking the joint out for 15 bucks and change. Can't beat that to try out a place you've never been. I buy that bad boy deal and off we go. We're headed to Local in all of it's Sou'side glory.

We decided to sit upstairs, which is going through a renovation to make it look more like a beer garden. They must be done with most of the work, as the room was nice and airy with a great view looking out at the city and some giant fan in the ceiling that was moving their air around like it was nothing. Well, I suppose it was nothing, but the size of the fan was impressive. That's my point there. Go up there just to check out that fan, kids.

There were smokers upstairs and that was a little bit of a bummer at first, but that GIANT FAN I was talking about in the previous paragraph wiped out that smoke pretty well. Like it was nothing, even. Man, that fan was cool. Literally. Anyway, we sat down and ordered some beverages and our dinners. My other half got The Steelworker, which consists of the Local's four cheese mac and cheese smashed between two burger patties, which is then wrapped in bacon, deep fried in Arsenal cider batter, and topped with queso fresco and a jalapeno relish. It was cray, as the kids say. She enjoyed it muchly. 

I tried some of the wings, which were top notch. They were of the \"blondie\" variety, which our waitress didn't seem to know much about, but her basic description made them sound tasty. They were a little bit spicy and a little bit tangy and 100% AWESOMESAUCE. After that, we finished up with a couple slices of the chocolate cake and it, too was a real groove.

We just went back a second time this week. We sat downstairs this time. I had the triple decker reuben, which may rank as one of the best of that sandwich I've ever had. The corned beef on the samitch is really thin, and there was the perfect amount of kraut, cheese, and thousand island on top. You could taste every layer of the sandwich, with no one ingredient taking over any of the others. The bread it was served on was also killer

Did I mention the French onion soup? Well not I have. Terrific stuff, let me tell you. The cheese has that nice, unending pull away from the top and the bread and broth below it are superb. It has a very rich quality to it, which I liked a lot. The onions themselves were melt in your mouth goodness.

As for Mrs. Jason T., she tried the beef brisket. And while I was reeling in the thrills of my reuben, after having a taste of that brisket samitch, I knew what I would be getting on our next visit. The bbq sauce on it was mind bendingly good. And I love a good bbq samitch. I usually opt for pulled pork, but the beef here on this item of awesome was impeccable. How do they do it? I have no idea.

The staff is friendly and attentive. During our last visit, one of the managers came around to check on us regularly and also delivered some of the food. There's awlays good music playing, plenty of TVs to catch the games on if that's your thing, and a groovy view of Carson Street so you can always people watch if you're near the front of the joint.

So that's the Local for you. It's excellent and well worth the money with or without a Groupon special. Next time around we've thought about trying the mac and cheese appetizer just as an entree because the pictures of the thing make it look ginormous. It probably is. I'll look forward to it and that brisket."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I enjoyed this brunch spot very much! Wonderful food and $8 for a mimosa carafe. I watched he bartender put an entire bottle of champagne in the carafe of mimosas  can't beat that for 8 bucks! A young/college student spot overall but there were a few couples there of different ages."}
{"text":"Where to even begin? I know where...the 1-star. In town visiting friends and family we had reservations for a group of 10+ for brunch on a Saturday morning. We all roughly arrived around 11:30 and were greeted by lovely hostess, and the smiles were the only positive highly of our experience. This brunch spot was highly recommend and we were eager to dive in. I'll break down the morning by courses: 

Drinks- Fair priced and you get pay for. Sky and OJ ($3) was Sky with a splash of OJ. Some other people in our party ordered the $8 mimosa carafe. Solid deal and I was told they give you a full bottle of champagne. 

Timing on our food- All of our dishes 10+ came out together, but it was VERY obvious that a majority of our dishes were cooked and placed under a heat lamp for a significant amount of time. The system of cooking and having the food sit is unacceptable. By the time everyone received their dish, we dug into cold breakfast food! That's not how I want to start my morning. 

Taste/Quality- Underwhelming. For those at the table whom ordered eggs (eggs Benedict, over easy, medium, etc.) received over medium. The asparagus (garnish?) was soggy and lacked taste. The eggs Benedict i received had hash browns that were as grey a storm cloud. Also, the side of hash browns were spicy as all heck! It's like they placed the whole pepper shaker in the pan. 

Overall Experience- When I come back to visit Steel City I will be skipping The Local. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, but you simply cannot serve food cold and over cooked to me in the AM. Good Day Sir!"}
{"text":"I only live two blocks from Local Bar & Kitchen, so I'd been eagerly monitoring the progress of its construction throughout fall and winter. When the bar finally opened for St. Patrick's Day weekend, I enjoyed some cocktails on the superb rooftop deck. I had not properly dined there, however, until this past Friday evening.

I arrived with two friends around 7pm and was immediately greeted by the sickly sweet smell of vomit. That was almost enough to turn us away, but since we were immediately seated at a prime table overlooking Carson Street, we decided to stick it out.

In spite of the early hour, club-style music was blaring and we were forced to shout to hear one another. Thankfully the restaurant boasts a decent selection of beers on tap. (Stella Artois is suprisingly elusive in the 'burgh.) However, when the beer arrived my friend's glass was literally covered in lipstick marks. Strike two!

We ordered food which arrived quickly considering the packed space. The menu boasts that its salads are \"made with the freshest locally grown Anthony's Original Produce.\" Unfortunately, my Speedy Southwest Salad tasted anything but fresh. The lettuce was limp, the tomatoes were mushy, and the grilled chicken, which I chose to add, was rubbery and burnt. My companions' burgers, although large, didn't taste much better.

It's truly a shame that the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the space and utensils was so poor, because, in spite of the noisy soundtrack, the atmosphere of Local is pretty great. It's a mix of rustic and industrial chic, with wide plank wood floors, large iron gears bolted to the walls, and exposed beams and funky metal light fixtures on the ceiling. Assuming the vomit smell can be got under control, it's not a bad place for an after work cocktail or late night libation.  Once the weather is consistently warm, patrons can avoid indoor smells altogether and enjoy the fantastic view from the restaurant's best asset, its rooftop deck."}
{"text":"This place STINKS for brunch. I'm literally still sitting here waiting to see my waitress again so I can get the hell out of here. Not busy at all but multiple items forgotten or miscooked. Waitress seemed like she would rather be doing time in Guantanamo Bay. On top of everything, not one person in our party's food was barely above luke warm. Potatoes, asparagus and hollandaise were ice cold. Toast was dry and crumbly. If I could give this place negative stars I would. Even if we brought this up to our absentee waitress I doubt we would get much more than a yawn plus a bonus eye roll."}
{"text":"Went here two nights in a row. The food was pretty good, the servers are nice, and the drinks are awesome. I had the passion fruit mojito and two different margaritas and I recommend both. I'd definitely suggest sitting upstairs on the rooftop deck.
The brunch is also awesome and I highly recommend the pepper vodka for the bloody mary bar."}
{"text":"Ate a late dinner here while watching the game. I tried the mystery draft for fun and loved it (only $3!) I got a grilled cheese with a side of mac and cheese. The grilled cheese was amazing!! Atmosphere is fun and friendly"}
{"text":"I've been to LB+K 3 times now and can officially say I probably won't go back.  The first two times were at night and it was just your average over-crowded South Side bar.  The large open windows downstairs and the deck upstairs are great features and give any bar/restaurant great potential.  Unfortunately this great atmosphere cannot make up for LB+K's terrible service and mediocre food.

My friends and I went here for afternoon drinks on a Friday and sat upstairs on the deck as it was lovely outside.  We were literally the only people on the deck at first and our server still seemed completely overwhelmed or hungover - something was off.  My friend tried to order an IPA, but every one on the menu was out or not available for some odd reason.  (Not that our server knew this - he had to go try to get this beer and come back about 3 times to inform her the beer was not available.)  Finally our server suggested a beer for her, and she got it 30 minutes later, sans any apologies for the tardiness.  We ordered the pretzel appetizer and nachos.  The pretzels were obviously just defrosted soft pretzels, but the queso and honey mustard were pretty good.  The nachos took about 40 minutes to come out, after our server and a manager informed us \"they were on their way\"... no idea what took them so long.  When the nachos finally arrived, they were missing cheese so our server had to take them back to add that... they ended up being average nachos.  Our server then messed up our next drink order and brought out an extra beer.  We said we didn't want it, but he informed us just to keep it and he'd take it off anyways.  (Clearly they were just going to dump it out anyways - we may as well drink it.) When our bill finally came, the drink was on it and our server claimed he couldn't take it off.  (We've all served in restaurants before and know this is not the case.)  There was also never any apologies for the slow service/lack of beers.  

In the end, we left LB+K feeling robbed and disappointed for a place with so much potential.  I can only say that I'm glad we tried this place so I know to avoid it in the future."}
{"text":"Since moving here six months ago, I've made it here several times. It's always been pretty average and the only difference tonight was that the average night was coupled with a foul smell. The bar smelled like wet dog. I wiped it down with a wet napkin and it came up brown... Anyway, the smell didn't lift, but I stayed for dinner and a drink. I've been told that I MUST try a Pittsburgh steak salad. I decided to give it a go here tonight. I think I prefer regular salads... I liked the mixed greens and the steak was good. The fries were super soggy or super over cooked, which seems impossible to do in one dish, but they did it. Service was ok, nothing impressive. Bartenders and bar backs were talking about how they hooked up with randos, which was entertaining, but things sounded like they could have got a little rapey for one chick. Luckily it was her hook up story, so I guess she was fine. Anyway, I didn't hate it, so I'm sure I'll be back again when looking for a regular time."}
{"text":"This place kicked me out by some ginger for tapping  someone's beer bottle. Fuck this place that ginget pussy pussy didn't even work there, go TO MARIO'S INSTEAD"}
{"text":"I met a friend her for pre dinner drinks, and I really wasn't very impressed. The decor is cool and modern, and perhaps it would have been different had I come for a meal and sat in the dining area.

We decided to sit upstairs in rooftop bar area, and because it was chilly, there wasn't much of a view. Also, they serve drinks in plastic cups up there (which I'm assuming is what they generally do), and I wasn't a fan.

I think I will come back for food next time and sit in the dining rooms. The drinks were good, and the atmosphere seems cool, so I will have to give it another try."}
{"text":"I tried  Local today for the 1st time with 3 others. We all LOVED our food. I had the 3 Rivers burger. It was DELICIOUS! I also took a bite of the Pittsburgh pretzel, it was so good!! The portions for the price were GREAT! We will be back. The place is warm, welcoming and quite beautifully decorated!"}
{"text":"So I have a lot to say about this place. If you're in a rush or terribly hungry..... just don't bother with this place. If you want decent customer service... you MIGHT get it depending on the server. 

I've been here 3 different time and tried to give it multiple chances.
The first time, our food took over an hour because the server \"forgot to put it in\". We were given a free mimosa. 
The second time- my food took over an hour and was completely burnt and hard as a rock. We were given a free Mimosa again.
This time- our food took 45 minutes and it is not busy what so ever. The portions were incredibly small and our server was MIA. Our drinks sat empty and we were not offered another drink period. 
I've tried time and time again but I just can't with this place. Definitely consider another restaurant."}
{"text":"Checked in to local 7 times. Keep hoping my opinion of this place changes. They have a  decent beer selection and the food is par for the South Side bar scene. It's just the staff that isn't always the greatest."}
{"text":"I mean, I like this place and frequent it often. But I went today and ordered smoked wings, and they were clearly fried like a totally normal wing. If you want smoked wings go to south paw. Come on local if you have an entire section of your menu dedicated to \"the smoker\" then don't advertise smoked wings if you don't sell them!"}
{"text":"Beautiful upstairs atmosphere -- wood, steel beams, and an open wall.  The flavor and texture of the mahi mahi sandwich was amazing.  Usually, I'm not a big fan of getting chips instead of fries.  But these chips definitely exceeded expectations.  Great prices for both food and drinks."}
{"text":"I had read Munch's review of Local Bar + Kitchen in the Post-Gazette.  He seemed indifferent to it, didn't hate the food but had some issues with the whole lack of \"local\" which I totally understand.  So when a Groupon became available I figured I'd take a chance.

I often wonder if places like this read critics reviews.  In the case of Local Bar + Kitchen, it seems they did read what Munch had to say and did make some adjustments.  He wondered where exactly the pierogies made in McKees Rocks were from; the menu now clearly states that they are from Pierogies Plus.  Another one of Munch's criticisms was the lack of local brews; I can now say that they offer selections from both East End and Penn Brewery.  

I went ahead and ordered up the pierogies as my appetizer and Big Steve's Meatloaf sandwich as my entree.  The sandwich was very tasty.  I really liked the spicy Heinz glaze.  The pierogies were amazing, of course, but when you start with perfection and add butter, you can't really mess that up.  My service was okay, however it did seem to take awhile for someone to initially take my drink order and then when my pierogie appetizer came out my sandwich followed about 30 seconds later.  When all was said and done, though, my drink was not included in my final bill.  I wasn't sure if it was an oversight or my waitress being nice, but either way I left a nice tip.

One random note: the bathrooms were very clean.  At least the women's room, anyway.  

Local Bar + Kitchen is a place I might try again, but it's not the best place to just go for food.  And not all the food is actually \"local.\"  The bar was hopping, though, and it stayed busy.  My suggestion would simply be to omit the word \"kitchen\" from the name of the establishment.  If it was only called \"Local Bar\" people would see the name as describing the place, not their offerings - leading to less confusion and disappointment in diners."}
{"text":"Oh, Local. I want to love you so much. But I just can't. I want to start this review by saying that I have been here more times than I can count. Sunday funday, weeknight, weekend nights partying, weekday lunches. Now you might ask, for someone who doesn't love the place, why do I continue to give them my money? So I'll start with the positives.

1) It's convenient. My boyfriend lives in the Southside and if we want to get out and watch the weekend football games, this place is pretty reliable. They usually have some sort of special... I feel like Miller Lite on Sundays is practically free. Which brings me to my next point...

2) It's cheap. I mean, it's no $1 beer night at the former Barry's, but you can usually find a special that keeps your tab pretty low.

3) It's a pretty good atmosphere. I personally love to sit at the downstairs bar when the windows are open and people watch. But the upstairs open area is great too. 

So among these three positives, we can usually find justification to pop in and stick around for a little while. Now I can get into what makes me not love it.

1) The food. We now know better than to eat here. Everything I've ever eaten has been mediocre at best. You can tell that the quality of ingredients just isn't there. The flatbreads (another special at one day during the week) taste frozen; none of their food has a freshness to it at. all. I've tried burgers, salads, and pizza, and nothing has stood out as something I'd order again. This actually goes hand in hand with....

2) The service. As I mentioned before, I've been here more times than I can count. Literally EVERY TIME, my food order has been incorrect in one way or another. Whether a pizza comes with the wrong toppings or I just get something that I straight up did not order, there is always something off. I finally just gave up forever. I've had a few great bartenders and servers, but the majority are slow, unfriendly, and unhelpful.

All in all, it's definitely not my favorite place but we keep going back for the positives. I don't see myself ever trying to order food here again, but hopefully the service improves someday!"}
{"text":"So my wife and I ate here last night. She snagged a groupon so we gave it a try. At the end of the day, its a bar. We started with some apps that were mediocre at best. We were also sitting by the window and the AC was blowing strait down on us. I guess they had an AC issue and hadn't finished the duct work. So all of the air was blowing down on our corner. That being said, we could have asked to move. So that is on us. Then we tried the flatbread and the dough wasn't fully cooked. We didn't eat it. Because of the groupon we had to get to $30 in food. The apps were half off so we were $10 short. Then we tried the Cuban sandwich. That was ok. It wasn't very big but considering the quality of the other food, it was a star. Beer was cold and the bloody mary was good. That's the only reason for 2 stars. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Great experience at Local.  And especially on a Wednesday Night,  1/2 off bottles of wine and if you reserve a table for 4 ahead of time you get a free bottle.  Cant beat that in Pittsburgh.  Food and service was good.  Call ahead to get a table so you can sit up front,  People watching is fun.  Very lively spot!"}
{"text":"I rarely get to the Southside these days, but I have spent many a wild night there in my younger days. The Southside during the day is kind of on the dingy side.

It's been awhile since I've been here, but we decided on it as a meeting point with some family who live on the other end of the city. 

I ordered the pierogi sandwich on a pretzel roll. Can you get more Pittsburgh than this sandwich? Probably not. 

It was a good sandwich and the service was very attentive. Would recommend as a lunch spot even if you have a baby and young children in tow."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. 
Simple.
Tried Sunday brunch and was pleased to see the menu included more than only breakfast items.
Grilled cheese with pot roast rocked!"}
{"text":"Cool stop for drinks, cocktails, and pub fare in a trendy space with a couple of floors for varied seating.  

The rooftop bar is certainly different...in a good way...and is a fun space to enjoy some good times and good beverages while enjoying some of the outdoor elements.  Below that is a cozy space of mixed seating and a decent bar area - which is full of eclectic items to ponder at. 

While the service is a bit slow, it's a good stop for a drink or two while \"crawling\" along Carson Street."}
{"text":"I was all set to love this place because of the great concept.  The food was very good and reasonably priced.  But the music was way too loud, it was difficult to have a good conversation.

I enjoyed sitting on the patio deck, and the huge ceiling fan was fun.  I just wish there was some place to sit and talk without the loud music.  Local Bar and Kitchen tries very hard to be trendy and the people watching is fun, just not sure it's a good fit for me."}
{"text":"I like local. I can't believe it's already been 5 years since it opened, what a great st. patties day that was. Anyways, a lot has changed over those 5 years. The upstairs rooftop is great, giant ceiling fan to keep things cool, the Yinzerita machine running all day long, sun-shine central and hopefully not too many sloppy southsiders. 
Downstairs I love the full length open windows that fall out onto Carson street and attentive bartenders. The servers, are a bit slow and the food is decent. Last I was here was for my birthday in August and I had the Mexican War Streets burger with a side of awesomely crispy onion rings. A guac surprise is my favorite kind of surprise. 
The barlist gets better seasonally, but here we still cater to drunk young crowd, so yinzeritas and bud lights it is. Sigh. If you have one of their ampd cards [use at any Ampd location] you get a meal here free each year. I'll take it.
All in all it's fine enough, but the service is pretty slow. I can think of better places to go in the Southside. 

Also - I wish they would bring back their Black and Gold pizza they had when they first opened. It was BOMB."}
{"text":"I have been coming to local for years. When they first opened, I was in love with the place! I saw them as a south side restaurant that had fresh local food. Since then, my opinions have changed. Although I still do enjoy going to local, I see them more as a bar now. This place is packed on the weekends, expect a line out of the door on Fridays and Saturdays. 

They are famous for their yinseritas, (if I am spelling that right) which is a margarita with a beer in it upside down. Super good! Their menu ranges from pizza, to wings to sandwiches. Everything I ever had to eat there was decently good, but I enjoyed their pizza the most. 

Most recently, I visited with a friend for happy hour. Local has a pretty awesome happy hour...1/2 off drafts and some 1/2 priced appetizers. I ordered southern tier's creme brûlée , normally $7.50 and only $3.75 during happy hour! Sooo good! 

We also ordered their nachos as an appetizer. The portion was HUGE! And they were awesome- pork, tons of cheese, pico and jalapeños with scallions to top it all off... Super good! I did fine the pork to be really salty though. 

Our service was great and it always has been consistently good service every time I went. Local is definitely a good place to eat, not just a good place to drink in south side!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Our waitress Candice was awesome definitely a great asset to the business. Food was delicious. She was friendly knowledgeable of the menu with suggestions I will definitely be back hope we have her again as our server. The GM introduced himself also. Very great experience"}
{"text":"Sorry, Burgatory, my vote for best burger in the Burgh goes to Local. I am never disappointed with the burgers here. They are juicy and delicious. The service is always great and this has become one of my favorite South Side spots. 

Now the down side - it can get very crowded and loud on evenings and weekends, like many Southside places, if that's your scene, it's great, if it's not - then going during the week is probably the best bet for a quieter dining experience."}
{"text":"I went to Local for Brunch. Overall the food was just OK; I wasn't overly impressed by it, but it wasn't bad... Nothing to call home about. HOWEVER, the Bloody Mary bar was a BIG win and will keep me coming back! 

The build-your-own bar was only $8 for unlimited toppings, and had an impressive amount of choices. If you are a bloody mary drinker, DONT pass this brunch up!"}
{"text":"So, I've lived in PGH for two years now. And had been DYING to go here. Everytime I walk by on East Carson Street, I'm just like, DANG that place is HAPPENIN'. Le go! 

...But then I went. And was totally unimpressed. Awesome window seats taken (no ones fault), put at a high top in the back. Ordered beers. Decent selection. Ordered a cuban sandwich and cole slaw. Cuban wasn't pressed and the pork belly was probably the worse I've ever had. 

And then I literally got home and got sick like an hour later.. Maybe it was the cole slaw? I don't know. But I won't be going back to eat there ever again. Maybe roof deck for drinks in the far off future, but never for dining."}
{"text":"It was 15 degrees out and it It was really cold inside the restaurant. Too much breading on the fried vegetables. The boneless Parmesan chicken wings were awful. Too much breading on the chicken and the sauce was terrible. Grilled cheese was very very good. French fries excellent. Waitress friendly and accommodating. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Local is a good South Side spot. I have been here a couple times at different times of the day. They have good, solid typical bar appetizers but the key thing is definitely the brunch. My GF had the banana stuffed french toast and I think it changed my life it was so good. I went ahead and ordered their breakfast burrito that was made vegetarian sans the bacon. It was divine. Their breakfast potatoes are KILLER. Furthermore, they now are offering $14 bottomless mimosas. 

I am not a big South Side guy, but golly, if you're down there at weekend brunch time. Do it to it. Also, upstairs rooftop seating FTW."}
{"text":"We came here for Easter Sunday Brunch! I ordered the Eggs Benedict: it was tasty but I could have eaten more, they only served one and I was still hungry after. It came with breakfast potatoes and asparagus. My boyfriend agreed, he needed more food after his meal as well. They have a Bloody Mary bar and  mimosas pitcher, probably the best part! The environment was super chill; we were seated upstairs on a retro themed deck. I can see this being an awesome bar to bring friends that visit. I can't wait to be back for dinner and night life!"}
{"text":"Whilst I have to say the food was superb, the service was what made me want to throw up. My friends and I made an 8:30 reservation to sit down and eat, but after arriving only five whole minutes late at 8:35 they gave our table away to some randos. We stood there for literally 30 minutes waiting for them to accommodate us while we watched the people at our original table, that specifically had our friends name written on it, stuff their faces with delight. The waitresses didn't seem to care much, probably because they couldn't hear us over the loud metal music blasting on the second floor. I have to say I can't remember having buffalo chicken dip that good, but the progressive weak feeling in my knees I got from waiting for our second table of the night ruined the experience. I now have chronic tendonitis in my knees."}
{"text":"Local might as well be an Applebee's. It's offensively mediocre.

The service is mostly terrible. It's not as much a fault of the staff as much as management regularly understaffing.

The name would make you think you'd be encountering a nice selection of local beer or local food. Neither is really the case. They don't even have a higher volume of local brewers than on average.

The food is standard Sysco bar food with inconsistent cooking quality.

If you want local beer, go to Pipers. They've got local beer and clean their taps.

If you want a party, go to Mario's or Carson City."}
{"text":"It took me a while to return here from my last visit and all I could remember about this place is that I left feeling quite full.  As I said in my prior review, this place rocks, still.

Instead of venturing upstairs for our meal, we opted to sit at the bar where there would be minimal delay in our order and delivery of food.  Smart move.  I had myself a Yinzerita like I did the last time and I stayed with a burger, but this time I decided to try something new to me.  

I had opted for the B3 burger.  Beef, bacon and barbecue sauce.  Don't just think of the bacon as on top of the burger, it's also mixed with the beef inside the patty.  Juicy as ever and with the right amount of tang from the barbecue sauce.  Pair this with a side of the fries and it's a mighty good meal that will remind you of what good finger food is.  However, from the time I visited until I wrote this review, I have heard a nasty rumor that the B3 is no longer available.  I visited their website recently and after looking over the menu section I do not see it listed.  That may mean that this burger is extinct.  If that is the case, that makes me sad.

The bartender on duty that ended up serving us was amazing.  She was helpful when we had a question about items on the menu and great at giving suggestions."}
{"text":"As far as South Side Pittsburgh goes, I really love this place. I would have given 5 stars but at times it can get a bit too crowded and it takes forever to get a drink. That out of the way, I'll move on to the selling points.

- The appearance and tone of the bar is pretty cool with different set ups and seating going on throughout. The rooftop bar is my favorite area mostly spending my time up there.
- The drinks are strong and reasonably priced.
- The music is always good, definitely a mixture - plus a jukebox you can play.
- The crowd is mostly younger, lively and a good time.
- The brunch here is a good price and just about anything you could want - they have a DJ who spins good music and remixes - the selling point being pitchers of incredible mimosas!

I stick to what I know and this bar is close to the top of my list.. good vibe, good drinks and good times."}
{"text":"The most impressive part about this location is the set up and decorating. The decor includes props from the steel era in Pittsburgh, and a nice stone and wood interior.  The interior of the bar and restaurant are opened to the outdoor air on nice days. Unfortunately, my experience didn't match the ambiance.

The service here is one of two stories. Our first bartender only acknowledged us when we first arrived. We ordered a beer and a vodka cranberry, which we received with our first order. The well drink had a weak pour. After that, we were not acknowledged for the next 20 minutes. The next bartender Wendel, was fantastic, stopping by frequently to check on what we needed as customers. In general, it seemed like most of the service staff distracted one another by holding side conversations and horseplay. Considering the place wasn't busy during our stop here, we were disappointed by the initial lack of service.

One of the shining inventions at this bar is the \"Yinzerita.\" A margarita with a beer of your choice poured inside. The beer doesn't add anything special to the flavor of the margarita. However, it is an extremely novel drinking concoction. As a part of visiting here, everyone should have one.

We also ordered a \"Plain Jane\" pizza while we were here. We got the larger of the two pizzas they offered and it is the size of a regular bar pie you would find at most restaurants. The pizza had a thin crust, bitter sauce, and regular cheeses. It took around 40 minutes to deliver the order. Based on the size of the pie, it should have taken a lot less. Overall, I was disappointed in the delivery and taste of the pie."}
{"text":"The menu here is good, especially compared to your typical bar. The boneless wings are my go-to and they are everything I could dream of and more. I go with honey BBQ sauce and it hits the spot every time. They also do a good job of taking traditional bar foods like pizza, burgers, and sandwiches and giving them a unique twist. 

It gets kind of loud in here so don't plan to go here for dinner if you want to have any kind of real conversations. 

When I was here in the winter, it was super cold inside their dining area. They had a fireplace heater, but it didn't help much.

The summer is nice because they have a great patio. 

I think local is a great addition to the Southside and helps balance out all the shady dive bars on East Carson. Not so great if you want a place just for dinner, but if you want some good drinks too, it's definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"The DJ on Sunday will not take requests and plays shit music. He is stupid and I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times on blurry nights in the Southside. Local can get obscenely packed, way moreso than other Southside establishments, most likely due to it being relatively new. 

If you're lucky enough to be there on a night where it's jumping but not suffocatingly packed, Local can be a decent hang-out spot especially out on the patio in the summer.

The crowd is the typical Southside bar crawl crowd but if you're looking for sophistication and cosmopolitan feel... why go to the Southside? Folks are friendly enough, the service is fast if you can get to the bar but the prices can be a little expensif esp. for shots.

Still, I'd say I like Local for a night of drinking and swearing, if the weather's nice and the place isn't jam packed."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch and it was great!  $2 Mimosa's, and I had a delicious eggs benedict.  Coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"Management refused to let a member of our party in. Absolutely do not go here. Go to another one of the 15 bars on Carson. No reason for the denial of entry."}
{"text":"killer nachos and drinks with a terrific ambience.  Love the rooftop. This is a place you could stay all day"}
{"text":"Bloddy Mary bar was nice for brunch.  We liked the food, but didn't love it.  I would say the burrito was the best thing on the brunch menu based on the five dishes on our table."}
{"text":"The bartenders are literally crazy and super unfriendly. So sad! Looking for a good time, might want to take it elsewhere. Ain't nobody got time for that!"}
{"text":"Local, we finally went in. It was a Friday night and a little busy. I ordered the burger with cheese on buttered brioche. It was a pretty decent burger and good size as well. I ordered a salad to go with my burger. I was surprised at how fresh the salad was, and the tomatoes were nice and ripe. I had the white lightning beer, it was really good. I could not order a wine, they only offered cheap wine by the glass. 

I did not know that they had rooftop seating until I looked at the website, I will definitely go in this summer and sit up on the rooftop and have a beer and split a burger with my husband. The burger we had was way too much food for me. 

The server was very attentive but she was also very forgetful, Michelle said be nice but... She forgot our waters, she brought my husband a 16 ounce beer instead of a 25 ounce beer, she offered me balsamic dressing and brought me ranch, she forgot the mayo for my burger, she charged my husband for two 25 ounce beers when he only had the 16 ounce beers, she kind of argued about the price on the bill but then took care of it. She just needs to take a look at the table and pay attention to details and she will be a better server. 

When my son comes to visit in the summer we will go in and sit on the rooftop and have a beer."}
{"text":"Let the Party Begin!    We showed up on a Friday Evening - the weather is warmer so the windows were open.

I guess I am the Yelp Outlier here - I really had fun so hopefully they are reading the fellow yelper comments.

We ordered some food while we were getting our drink on.  I had Steve's Meatloaf Sandwich - it was pretty good.

What made this place fun was the fact it was packed, fun drinks, and a fun group.

We ordered one of their Margarita / Corona drinks (take a frozen berry or traditional Margarita and stick a full bottle of Corona a big fishbowl glass).    Our team (this became a sporting event) really enjoyed these drinks on top of the shots we ordered.

They had a more crowded section upstairs that I do not think I would have enjoyed as much - big screen tv, with poor ventilation + lots of people would have been very uncomfortable.

Our team ventured on down the street later.   

If you are looking for a fun time on a Friday Night - this should be one of your spots to visit - but there are others on the street.

Service - Great - the waitstaff was attentive and we had no problems getting our drinks (the place was packed)
Price - Not bad / not the cheapest - my beers were $3-6, the crazy drinks I think were around $10
Atmosphere - March Madness, Friday Night, Great Seats (in the window), fun conversation = a good time

I would recommend."}
{"text":"The only thing that local has going for it is the atmosphere and $8 mimosa carafe. Even the mimosa's were lacking on the champagne. So I'm happy I didn't pay double for the carafe. I have been to a lot of brunch spots and I was not impressed with my mediocre meal. They do offer quite a bit on the menu, so maybe my breakfast sandwich pick just wasn't a good one. It comes with fried egg, american cheese, roasted red peppers, bacon, sausage or ham on an english muffin. The brunch potatoes on the side are pretty much like shredded hash browns with what tasted like cumin. There wasn't a whole lot of flavor happening on the sandwich and the portions were awfully small. The sandwich may have tasted a little better if it was on different bread. The music was great though! They were playing throwbacks from the late 90s early 2000s and my friend and I loved every second of it."}
{"text":"The prices are insane. It's absolutely criminal that they charge what they do for the dry, chewy food that clearly has been microwaved. It's like eating leftovers you didn't enjoy the first time."}
{"text":"the diesel fries are GONE...yes i am dropping a star for that, they are so easy to make i don't see the hassle, they have a small menu it wouldn't kill them to microwave some cheese on fries. Im devastated in case you cant tell. Their ranch dressing is amazing. Other than that its a nice place to eat and have drinks. Food and/or drink Specials every day. 

P.S I love the new plates, bowls, and baskets! Makes the food look way more appealing. & I added pics of the menu(s)"}
{"text":"I cannot comment on the food as I didnt eat there, only had some drinks.  
My friends and I stopped in on a Sunday and the area was packed so I was surprised when we could get a table right away.  The upstairs is a big open space, and they may even open it up in the warmer weather?  They had Sunday brunch going on so I had a bloody mary.  I asked the bartender to make it for me, even thought there was a make your own option.  (I love to drink em, but dont know how to make em)  They had lots of different beer options, also.  Made for a fun and casual afternoon stop!
I definitely want to go back to try the food.  It looked good."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and I have to say my opinion was the same with each time that I was there, so Local, you get an A+ for consistency but that is about it.  

Minus the very nice bartender, my experiences at Local leave me not wanting to go back.  The food was not as good as I was hoping (even though each time I had gotten different items), and the service (even when I was there with a friend of the owner) was blatantly not good.  My friend made an excuse claiming they must be \"short staffed\" but in an area like the Southside, there should always be a back up plan or someone should step up to help insure decent and acceptable service.  

I will say that they had a decent beer list, and the drinks were good, but for those types of things, I have a lot of other choices.  Chances are, I will not be back to Local anytime soon."}
{"text":"I got to watch WVU & Pens in the same room. The smell of bleach made me realize two things. The place is clean & the Southside is still the Southside. I loved it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of local is very fun, which is why it gets more than one star.  This is especially true in the summer when the windows are open.  It makes for a great day drinking spot.  The drinks are also pretty good.

Now to the bad.  The food is average.  I have never heard anyone I went there with be impressed with their meal.  I got a burger on my last trip there.  Ordered it medium rare and it came out dry and well done.  My wife's breakfast sandwich was soggy and lacked flavor.  It's the little things like this that are annoying about a place that has potential to be great, but just misses the spot.  The service is always slow and mistakes are made often."}
{"text":"I was grabbing lunch with a group of people on a Sunday afternoon in the newly renovated beer garden on the second floor. Contractors were on the roof screwing roofing panels with impact drivers creating a lot of noise. It seems that the scheduling for the contractors to finish up the renovation was poorly planned."}
{"text":"We finally decided to eat at Local! Bobby had a Sunday morning off thanks to his new job and he's never experienced brunch before because he worked all weekend. We decided on Local for a few reasons. 1) the first place we stopped at had a 1.5 hour wait. 2) their brunch menu looked tasty 3) We never ate at Local before 4) bloody mary bar.. end of story.

We strolled down E. Carson on a sunny Sunday funday and headed into local. For drinks, i got a mimosa carafe (a good 5 drinks.. atleast) it was $8. you could also get unlimited carafe for $14. Bobby ordered from the bloody mary bar. You got to choose your vodka and then it was served to you. The bar was behind you FULL of fresh veggies, spices, hot sauces. Also they had 3 different options for the drink. One was an already spiced bloody mary mix, another was straight tomato juice and the last was V8. I'm not a huge fan of bloody mary, but bobby made a great one! (actually he ordered 2)

For brunch, I ordered Banana's Foster Stuffed French Toast. It was stuffed with honey cream cheese and had a delicious glazed syrup on top, topped with bananas. It came with a side of breakfast potatoes. Bobby ordered the Southern Style Breakfast- sausge gravy over biscuits, piece of ham, sausage, 2 eggs + grits. He seemed to like it but im not sure if he was a huge fan of the grits. I did try the sausage gravy and it was great!

Service was fine and we really liked our brunch date :) 

**Not sure if their brunch menu online is up to date. it seemed that a few things were missing. Also, i seen a few people order their sandwiches.. they looked AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Service was a little slow but we went when it was packed so I can't complain. Definitely recommend going."}
{"text":"I would never in a million years think I'd like this place by looking at the outside of it but I have pretty much been here once a week since I moved here in August.  Not even kidding.

The brunch is perfect for an every-week kinda thing.  Nothing special, but super tasty and the prices are ridiculously reasonable.  Carafes of mimosas for $8?  Uh, yeah.  

The upstairs patio is so wonderful on a beautiful morning or evening, and is incredibly spacious.

The servers are ALL wonderful.  Every one.  Been here probably 30 times and never had bad service.

The manager works his butt off.  You see him assisting the servers all the time. Major points for that.

The dinner menu is also fantastic, and they run good daily deals.

I have also never ever waited for a table.

Keep it up, Local.  Lindsay and Joe love you."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for this place before my trip to Pittsburgh.  It was a quick and easy drive from Station Square where our car was parked after exploring the city via the T.  We got here about 6-6:30pm and there was plenty of seating for the four of us.  It was very warm in the bar and they said they didn't want to put the air conditioning on or allow us to open the large windows facing the sidewalk.  We asked them to adjust the ceiling fan to blow down instead of circulating up (winter mode), and they did.  Upstairs was being renovated and it was a bit too dark for what I preferred.
Hubs and I both had pulled pork sandwiches yinzer style with very tasty homemade chips.  Very good!  Our boys had tasty looking burgers and fries.  The place was comfortable with tv's around and decent seating with lots of light (close to the door/bar) and got livelier as our meal went on.  By 7:30ish the crowd was mainly young 20's and some were rude and mouthy.  Glad to get out of there when we did.  A little too much cleavage and cursing for my liking as a mom of a 14 and 11 yr old.
Also ordered the fried pickles for an app.  So-so.  Probably more so just my taste, not the quality of them.
Since we had the groupon and I was trying to spend at least $60, we ordered the only dessert they offered - chocolate cake.  Oh dear God that was good!!
All in all, a very nice place!"}
{"text":"Great bar! Nicely designed, going upstairs is great with the open wall. They have great cocktails and drinks and food that will satisfy your taste buds! Great place to watch a Steelers game with good service and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"All bars in Pittsburgh look there same. The thing that separates this place is the food quality.  The knee bartender had some serious sass but she got the order right so whatever.   Come to Local Tap good little dive to catch up with old friends."}
{"text":"After I had the brunch here, I am sold.  Had an omlette with brunch potatoes and it was yummy!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is fun and food is delicious. Definitely recommend the challah french toast. Downstairs is great on the weekends with the live music. However, it is a bit too loud. Additionally, upstairs smoking is allowed, which definitely ruined my dining experience."}
{"text":"More like a 2.5 Star.  Local Bar and Kitchen is 100% more bar than kitchen and I wouldn't recommend any food here. 

We got the Steelworker burger which, on paper, sounds amazing but ok the plate wasn't really anything like the description and didn't even come on a bun. 

The chicken nachos were the saddest thing I've ever seen. They were like in the opening scene of Stepbrothers where Will Farrell makes nachos by melting shredded cheese in the microwave. Just a pinch of cheese, totally bland chicken, weird jalapeños that weren't spicy at all, diced tomatoes and sour cream topped this disaster.

The wings were fine. We got the Local Lickr' sauce. 

The spinach artichoke dip was probably the best thing we ordered but once again, nothing to run home and tell momma about. 

Luckily it was happy hour so half priced apps and we had a Groupon for a discount. 

Let's talk about the Bar half. Great beer selection, large TVs and bar, and a nice young crowd make this a solid spot to go for a drink. Happy hour was 1/2 priced drafts too so we were drinking some tasty craft beers for $3. 

The wait staff was knowledgeable and friendly and the place seemed clean enough. 

Go for the beer and specials, stay away from the food. Go Pens."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a few cocktails here for some afternoon drinking. Not overly impressive food but wait staff was attentive and friendly. Drink specials were a good deal."}
{"text":"Decent beer and liquor selection but the food situation is quite poor. There is absolutely nothing local about the ingredients. They serve pre-made burgers, freezer section sides, and Mrs Ts pierogies that you would have at home. The sausage gravy and biscuits was atrocious. Cake like biscuits broke apart and could not be forked. The whole dish appeared to be heavily salted prior to serving, so it overwhelmed the whole plate. No kidding, so much salt my tongue felt shriveled and rough. The corned beef hash was straight out of a can. 

I feel that the \"local\" aspect of this place is deceiving and inaccurate. Nothing fresh to be found here."}
{"text":"Great beer selection   Cute servers. Food sucks   Oh well u can't have it all i  guess"}
{"text":"The bar atmosphere is nice. But can we turn down the music a little!? You can't even have a conversation there without screaming.The rooftop is pretty cool in the summer.  The music isn't that loud up there and you can enjoy the weather.  That is where I usually go.  But the roof doesn't have a good view or anything. lol

I was really pleased with the food. Good quality and presentation. Try the margarita pizza (ask to make it RED not white, as it is on the menu)! Prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"I am from out of town & was visiting a friend when I dined at Local for brunch. Simply one of the best brunches I have ever attended. I loved sitting on the top floor & I highly recommend the Mimosa craft that's $8.00!"}
{"text":"The service was slow, even though there were only ten people there on a Thursday night. The yinzer brisket sandwich didn't have the pirogies on it. My steelworker burger only had one macaroni on it, where it's supposed to be stuffed with Mac and cheese. And to top it off we were charged with an extra drink on our bill, but at that point we just wanted to leave so we didn't even argue, paid the bill and left. We'll never go back and we are looking forward to see what takes this poor excuse for a restaurants place on Carson street in the near future."}
{"text":"My roommate and I came in on a Sunday morning looking for a quick bite. We were pleasantly surprised with the relaxed but trendy atmosphere and great food. She had the breakfast burrito and I had an omelet that were both delicious and very filling. Our server, Matthew, was also a treat. He was incredibly friendly and attentive and truly added to our great experience. 

We definitely plan on going back!"}
{"text":"I feel like Local has gone downhill. I'd always recommend it to people saying it had really good food, with a caveat of slow service.

The service is still incredibly slow. The food, however, hasn't remained really good. 

The last time I went with a friend for brunch. It took 20+ minutes to order and another 20+ minutes to receive my order. (She'd gotten there early and had already finished eating before I got a chance to order.) I got the bananas foster french toast. Like many things on the menu, it *sounds* delicious and creative. What you get is always a let down from that expectation.

\"2 croissants with fresh bananas and honey cream cheese. With house potatoes.\"

Well, the croissants were there. The bananas were not, which is a pretty big oversight in \"bananas foster\" anything. The croissants were covered in an incredibly sugary, thick sauce. The honey cream cheese was so thick and cold like it just came out of the fridge, I couldn't eat it. The potatoes were fine.

It took a long time to order, get food, get refills, get checks, get our cards back, etc. It was sunny that day- a warmish Sunday in February- so they had the front doors open. But it was still only 50° with a breeze. Sitting just next to the host stand at the doorway, we were cold and in our coats. We asked the hostess to close the doors, and she had to get a manager due to their height. He closed one of the double doors...which only made the breeze stronger and us colder. When I asked him directly, he obliged and closed the second.

Just poor service. Slow and inattentive, and the food was definitely not good enough this time to even that out. I dont think I'll be back.

Oh! It was alllll 90s music while we were in there. That's one part I didn't mind"}
{"text":"Checked out Local on a beautiful Sunday evening and the primary reason for going here was b/c of their patio.  

I was really surprised to see it so crowded, there weren't any open tables upstairs so my friends and I ended up standing, which wasn't a big deal b/c we had been sitting for a while previously.  

We didn't eat food, but the drinks were good.  The crowd seemed a bit young, but perhaps with the end of the school year, college students are trying to enjoy their summers.     

While it was great to be outside, I'm not sure the crowd suited me."}
{"text":"There I am, looking cool af with some cat eye sunglasses, drinking up the rays on the top deck. It has an industrial vibe, brick walls with large, bright geometric prints. There's a huge fan and wide windows that almost make you feel like your outside.

My eggs benedict are almost perfect and my mimosa tastes a bit more like orange juice than is preferable for a Sunday morning, but I am digging these vibes and loving the Pittsburgh restaurant scene.

Right on the Southside, street parking is convenient during the day and the prices are reasonable for their big portions and (somewhat) thoughtful plating. 

I recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after doing some shopping in the Strip District. Unfortunately they were only serving off their brunch menu until 2pm. Beer selection was pretty good. We had drinks at the bar prior to our table being ready, bartender was attentive and helpful. Wish she had been our server. Our server was slow and not the most attentive. Numerous time had to ask for more water and took her some time to bring the drinks despite seeing them on the bar waiting. Food was ok, because it was brunch no French just home fries with the burger. Burger quality was ok, bun was delicious but burger was over cooked. My mother in law ordered the a steak salad. When the salad came out there was no steak and no oil/vinegar. When the runner was asked for both he never returned, not even the simple oil/vinegar. When the server finally stopped by (after flagging the hostess for oil/vinegar, she was at least quick to return) we mentioned there was no steak. Most of use had almost finished by the time the steak arrived. No real apology and definitely no offer to compensate for the mistake. Overall an average experience, wouldn't plan to go back or commend unless looking to stope in for a drink."}
{"text":"Food is eh service is very very slow. Nice wait staff. If you're coming to get drunk, you'll succeed for a fraction of the price of other brunch places around here. The Bloody Mary bar is bomb."}
{"text":"The description on their website says this place is relaxing and comfortable and the menu looked decent for a bar and grill, so I decided to give it a try.

BF and I walked in and the first thing we heard was Genuine's \"My Pony\" blaring at a club level volume and the first thing we saw were two huge bouncer looking guys guarding the door. I walked out to look at the sign because I thought I must have walked into the wrong place..no, we were at Local. Walked back in, the two 'bouncers/hosts' didn't greet us, just stood there staring at me...so I walked out.

I'm pretty sure this was a good indication that our experience would not be relaxing. Not sure about the food, but this is certainly a club vibe first, which usually caters to drunks who will eat anything."}
{"text":"Loved this spot! Came for New Years day. Mimosas were $8 a pitcher! They also had the game going. Although the kitchen was slow the food didn't look great but it tasted really good. I think one of the cooks called. But the vibe overshadowed the negative. The also played hip hop! Shout out to whoever made the playlist. I could stay there a few hours ....especially if they had a couch"}
{"text":"we just got drink tonight nothing was special or different but ! our server was great ! we were sitting when you enter on the right second table for 6, i am giving 5 star just because of smiling face cute nice server :) thanks for serving you were so nice to us:)"}
{"text":"Stopped here to meet a friend for a 'birthday dinner' after work on a Thursday evening.  The weather wasn't great (heavy rain) so that could have attributed to the partially full bar and restaurant.  It was early though, around 6:30, so if you're of the GenX range, this is a normal time, born after that, it is probably early!

Really fantastic happy hour specials.  Domestic bottles and appetizers were half off.  We shared the ballpark pretzel which came with two pretzel sticks and two dipping sauces of cheese or honey mustard.  Very good.

For dinner I ordered some wings and a flatbread pizza.  I immediately boxed half of each to enjoy at a later time, but to be honest, I didn't enjoy the bianca flatbread either time.  It just had little to no taste to it.  The wings were decent though.  

Service was ok.  I noticed the wait staff going in and out of the bathroom a lot to use their cell phones.  But food came out quickly and was served hot, so not real complaints."}
{"text":"I finally visited Local for the first time last night for a work happy hour. I absolutely love the decor -- I think it's very warm and inviting and reflective of its Pittsburgh location.

The happy hour was held on the rooftop deck, which is now covered and has heaters for the wintertime. I was concerned that I was not dressed very warmly for the cooler space, but the temperature was still warm enough for me. So don't be afraid to eat or drink up there during the winter months!

I was really impressed by the service. Within the first 10 minutes of walking in, I had three different employees come up to me offering to get me and my friends drinks. Even when the room became packed, I was still checked on several times over the hour or two that I was there. However, their beer selection seemed a bit limited... I asked for both Sam Adams Oktoberfest and Yuengling, and was told that they did not have either. (I actually now question this because their online menu says that they should have Yuengling.)

They had long tables filled with pizzas, chips, dips, etc. for the happy hour. Sadly, the room was so packed that I didn't even check out all the food since people were blocking some of the tables. I just tried their cheese pizza and chips with queso. The cheese pizza was cold, which was somewhat understandable considering the temperature of the space was pretty cool. However, the chips and queso were very good, and the queso was still a warm temperature. Even though I've had very limited exposure to the food, it was good enough that I would like to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"I've visited Local several times before and have never had a bad experience. The food is always tasty and service is never an issue. 

My last visit was no different. We sat upstairs on the patio (first time) and I was amazed by how big and open it was. Not only is there an abundance of extra seating, but a second bar! Very convenient! 

What I love about Local is there ever-changing menu and ability to incorporate local fresh food. Definitely a huge plus! I ordered the Three Rivers Burger and OMG... was it good! A delicious burger sandwich between a pretzel loaded with cheese, peppers and more! If you're into spicy foods, this is for you! What more can you ask for?! All sandwiches are served with a side of homemade chips but you can substitute for fries for a few extra bucks. Even though it sucks paying extra, it's well worth it! They even have sweet potato fries! 

For drinks, all Absolute products were on special for $4 during our visit on Friday night so I ordered a vodka/sprite. Tasty! My boyfriend, however, got an AMAZING Cucumber Melon Smash cocktail (Muddled cucumber and lemon, Effen Cucumber Vodka, melon liquor and honey syrup with a splash of lemonade garnished with a cucumber and lemon). It was one of the best drinks I've ever tasted. So refreshing and light, yet enough to get you feeling good! 

Two burgers/fries and three drinks ended up being around $50, however after the Groupon we purchased, the bill was $20. Always look for Groupon deals because they're actively for sale (we got the $19 for $30 deal)."}
{"text":"I've been to Local several times, most recently this evening with two friends. We sat upstairs on the large rooftop deck, where we all enjoyed the basic Local burger. Myself and one guest ordered regular fries, the other chose sweet potato fries with the burger. I previously had their sweet potato fries, but didn't find them as delicious as other restaurants serve. That said, I won't order them again.

Although the waitress was quite friendly, she certainly didn't win points for promptness. It took almost 10 minutes from drink order to drinks on the table. Wasn't sure what was going on in that department.

Overall, a good restaurant with safe-bet, tasty bar food options that will appeal to almost anyone (although the restaurant mostly draws in the 21-35 m/f crowd)."}
{"text":"Marginal food - I had the Mexican burger and a search party was needed to find the guacamole. We sat for 15 mins before a server approached our table and that was only because we asked the hostess for a server. The bartenders were nice but I won't go back as there are plenty of other spots that can do better."}
{"text":"I pretty much loved everything about this place. I would have given five stars if our server didn't suck. I remember her name but it'd be rude to call her out. We kept having to constantly remind her to bring silverware or more water. When asking her a question about something on the menu she had no idea then would walk away. 
Besides that the rest of the staff was helpful and pleasant. 
I really liked the whole layout of this place & thought it was beautifully designed. 
We ordered some pretty fucking good food too! Super happy with that! The buffalo chicken dip I could die eating. But no complaints about any of the food. A must eat again!!"}
{"text":"While this place really isn't my scene, I have imbibed there on more than one occasion so it would appear that I like it. Their beer selection isn't massive but it is encompassing of many styles, and I like that they have an assortment of local brews. The thing that will bring me back time and time again is their nachos - the waitress told us they were her favorite, and she was absolutely spot on. That cheese sauce is like melted dreams, demanding a happy satisfaction from every tortilla chip dunk.. Plus the amount of nachos is pretty impressive as well - we had our fill, then invited the crowd of people around us (girl in crutches, here is your shout-out) to take some as well. Mmm, beer and nachos..."}
{"text":"Headed here for brunch this morning. I have mixed feelings. 

The 8 dollar mimosa carafe and 8 dollar build your own Bloody Mary is a good deal. 

My son got the Pittsburgh meat lovers omelet. That's probably the way to go here. It's huge and fed both my 10 and 8 year old.  The sausage in the middle was cold.  

I got the monte Cristo and was unimpressed. Seemed like the bread was soggy pancake bread, and there was no powdered sugar.  It was definitely not what I would expect in a monte cristo. The potatoes were good though. 

Brother-in-law got the eggs Benedict. It's a single egg, single English muffin serving that's light in the hollandaise sauce. He got an extra cup but it was cold and when we got the bill we were charged 70 cents for it. I can't believe that we were charged after he told her it didn't seem like there was any sauce on it. I wasn't impressed with what I tasted.  

Finally, who in the world blasts club music at brunch? Once the DJ got here we couldn't hear each other talk, which took away from the experience further. 

I'll definitely opt for another brunch spot next time."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and enjoyed myself both times for brunch. The first time I had french toast and potatoes, which were really delicious. And then of course we had bottomless mimosas and they were fabulous.The second time was more recent and I had bananas foster. It was SO GOOD. I wish they put a little more banana on top, but I still loved it all the same. Both times the place was crowded and we ate upstairs. The mimosas were great again and we had a nice waitress who didn't take forever and ever with our orders and checks. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Been to Local Bar + Kitchen 3 times now and I would say I enjoyed my experience 1 out of the 3 times.  The service tries and is friendly, but for lunch it's tough to get out of there in under an hour.  On my second visit I tried to order a sandwich named after a hockey player that used to live close to the restaurant.  The player had just signed with another team and they told me that I couldn't have the sandwich because the player didn't play for the Penguins anymore.  At first I thought she was joking, but she was serious, and I couldn't get the sandwich.  

I literally was grossed out by the smell of the Mojito Chicken sandwich that was served to me on my first visit.  On my final visit I ordered the Plane Jane Street pizza (standard cheese pizza, pretty hard to mess up), the crust was soggy, it was over garlic'ed, and there was some kind of sauce on the edge of my pizza that I had no idea what it was.  Luckily the sauce didn't have any flavor so it didn't impact the pizza.

There are much better places on the South Side to eat, while Local tries to cater to the foodie crowd by offering locally grown product they just don't deliver with good tasting food."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner for a friends birthday. We sat upstairs at the rooftop bar. The ambiance was really awesome. It's small, but luckily for us it wasn't crowded. I ordered their special, crab stuffed portobello for an appetizer and bruschetta flatbread for the main course. The portobello was a little disappointing. The portion was small and it was $12, so we expected it to be much bigger. The flatbread, however was delicious. It was one of the best flatbread pizzas I've ever had. 
I will definitely keep this place in mind for dinner more often."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, OK drinks, and acceptable other options as well.  During spring and fall, the rooftop deck is a fun place at night and relaxing for lunch.  One considerable advantage is that the portion sizes have never left me hungry (at least from the limited items I've sampled).  It's a well-rounded bar.  I'd probably give it 3.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Not bad. I wish I was hungrier when I visited so I could have enjoyed it more! Very cool atmosphere, especially in the summer so the rooftop bar is open (not entirely rooftop - it is enclosed, which is actually really nice when it is the middle of August). Lots of beer choices, but as a non-beer drinker, I wish there were more cocktail choices that weren't full of Red Bull. May visit again to try the brunch specials."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe of this place. Local food roof top dining with drinks.  Everything was delicious and locally sourced.   The baked goods were over the top with the local bakery."}
{"text":"Poor service. Took at least 20 minutes to get out order in at the bar. Part of the fault on the restaurant for only having 1 bartender but she passed us multiple times without asking if we are ready to order. After ordering another 20 minutes went by, without our appetizer coming yet, where the bartender tells us that one of the main meals we r ordered is sold out. An hour after ordering we then received our appetizer and then meals shortly after. The nachos were excellent, the Reuben we give a 3/10 and the grilled cheese was boring. Wouldn't recommend it and don't plan on going back anytime soon. Just glad we had a groupon so we didn't have to pay full price."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch in Pittsburgh! $7 for a carafe of Mimosas(so good)! Also the breakfast burrito is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Came here during a Sunday fun-day afternoon, and was really pleased with everything. We sat right at a front window, so had a nice breeze and a lovely people-watching location. We tried to go to the rooftop, which is awesome, but there was not a soul up there.

This was my second time here, and the first time I glanced at a menu and thought it was sparse, so they must have added a bunch of new items.

Our server was super sweet and helpful, recommended a brew for the bf and sangria for me, which was a huge goblet of yum. They have some great vegetarian/vegan options on the menu and they all sounded really good. I wasn't very hungry, and snacked on the hummus, which was garlicky but good. My bf ordered a mediterranean-style 'za, and he siad it was very good. 

I'll be back here again!"}
{"text":"Food is good and they try to purchase/carry local produce and items. What had a 2nd strike from me is the service! Very slow - cannot find server to get refills - when u r in a party of 5 or more  don't head there for lunch u will never make it under an hour. And good luck getting your order to you correctly!!! Just bad service over all but good is good and priced reasonable."}
{"text":"I love when a new bar comes to town because you never know exactly what you're going to get. Even as it prepares to open you only can imagine what clientele could be entering what may be your future new hang out.

I've given Local 2 stars only because I haven't eaten there yet so I cannot judge it on it's kitchen. I love the look of the bar/restaurant and the roof top deck (if you could move when you're up there).

But to keep this simple, the bar is douche bag city. If that's your kind of people then have at it. If you enjoy the bro's and ho's bar mentality then I think you'll like it. It really wasn't what I expected for this place. I really cannot blame the management, or can I? Could it have been marketed differently? Maybe, but I can only talk about what I saw and I can say I won't be seeing it again."}
{"text":"During my week stay, I ate here twice and came back again for a couple of good beers and some sports on their TV's
     As for the food. Of the 5 dishes I tried (3 were my friends), all were very good. I will admit that my burger was the best I've had on Carson St, over the last 5 years of visiting for business. 
     My favorite combo was the Red Sky at Night Beer and the Buffalo Chicken Dip. Spicy Food and Strong Beer. Yes I like strong beer. 
     If your not drinking 7%+ beer you should be in diapers. They do have weaker brews but why waste your money. Drink strong and spend less.
     I will be back here every year that I get to visit. It's just a good comfortable place to eat, hangout and enjoy friends or chill out by yourself. 
     It's a really nice place with good food and good service."}
{"text":"I visited Local Bar and Kitchen this evening for a low key anniversary dinner with my girlfriend. We were seated immediately because there wasn't too large of a crowd in the dining area. I ordered the Old Faithful burger and added blue cheese. My girlfriend ordered the fried chicken sandwich. 

Our waitress was kind but she was the only person working in the dining room. Why on a Sunday night after a Steelers play off game is there only one waitress? She could hardly keep up to come over and take our order. 

The restaurant was FREEZING and it easily took 40 minutes for our food to arrive to our table. I know the bar was pretty busy but there were only 4-5 tables in the dining area. I think it was a little ridiculous we waited that long for food. 

Finally our food arrived to our table without the side of mayo and ranch we put with our order originally. It took 10 minutes for our server to come back and see if we needed anything. I took a bite of my burger to check if it was cooked medium rare. It was so well done and any of the juice that may have been left in it soaked in the bun. My cheese was no where to be found. The only thing hot on the plate was my fries. 

My girlfriends chicken sandwich was really good and if I'd ever return here I'd get that. The flavors were there chicken was a little dry but overall a good bite. 

Once the waitress returned I explained to her my food was way over cooked. She talked to the kitchen and within 5 minutes they brought me another one. This one was much fresher than what I was originally given. The burger was cooked correctly but it lacked seasoning. 

This restaurant is a sandwich and bar food place. If that's all you serve then you need to work on your food. This place has an obvious lack of communication and whoever manages this place needs a reality check. 

I hate to be so harsh with a review but I was extremely disappointed with my experience. I hope this place turns their restaurant around or I don't see it being there too much longer. 

P.S. I forgot to mention they were out of 4-5 things on the menu. Good thing it wasn't anything I had wanted to order."}
{"text":"Good brunch if you feel like waiting forever for a drink from the slow bartenders and waitresses, the. Waiting over 45 min for the food you ordered. 

Show up early but still expect to wait forever!!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Husband and I stopped for some drinks and appetizers on a Saturday evening. They were out of the first 2 beers my husband asked for. He was finally able to get a beer on tap. My
Mojito was awful. It basically tasted like lime water.
If there was any soda water in it, it had to be flat. The mint leaves did not look muddled at all. Basically just 5 (not fresh) mint leaves stuck in the drink. I didn't even finish it. Complete waste of $9. Spinach and artichoke dip wasn't bad but was nothing special. Mostly seemed like a cheese dip though with a tiny amount of spinach and artichoke. At least the pita was warm. It's a shame because they have a pretty decent rooftop bar area. I might stop back if it's a nice night and I want to hang out on the upper deck bar, but not likely to be back otherwise."}
{"text":"I gave this place three stars because they have the Touch Tunes music machine, which is really nice. It's a cool place to chill when there aren't that many annoying, racist, arrogant college students around. I just felt relaxed in there. The best time to go is during the week in the afternoon."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour and to get a bite to eat after work on a Monday and it was the perfect atmosphere to de-stress! It wasn't packed, they were playing good music, we got a table by the window so it felt like we were sitting outside and the best part? $3 drafts! The food was good but pretty typical so nothing to rave about but I def enjoyed the ambiance and drinks. Our waitress told us that on Mondays it is $3 drafts and Wednesdays it is like a buy one get one wine night. I dunno. Anyway, I'll totally be back."}
{"text":"This place looked cool, and the menu was decent.  Good selection of sandwiches, burgers, pizzas, etc.  I ordered the special soup which was a creamy corn chowder, and when it arrived it was topped with a thick layer of orange grease.  When i tried to stir it up, more grease bubble dup from the bottom.  against my better judgement I tasted it...and immediately said \"nope, can't do it\".  I sent it back and the manager came out to explain that they don't use \"real\" butter so when soups are heated, the fat separates and rises to the top.  Ew. I also ordered the stuffed banana peppers, and could only make it through one.  They came out luke warm at best and had SO much salt that after one pepper i downed my water and had an instant stomach ache.  I won't go back!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't decide on a place to eat, but I'm glad we decided on Local.  It was a Sunday night and not too crowded. Our waitress was really nice and attentive! We sat right in front by a large window that they opened so it was almost like being outside.  It was a prime position for people watching in the Southside.  We ordered the spinach artichoke dip appetizer which was pretty good.  It had more of a tart creamier taste than traditional spinach artichoke dip but I still liked it a lot.  Both the chips and pita bread were great with it.  We also ordered a few salads which were huge! The salads did not come with any meat, but they were good without it.  We ended up paying for our meal with a Groupon that was $15 for $30 worth of food.  Our meal cost exactly $30 so we didn't have to pay anything, but wanted to leave a tip on a credit card, so we ended up having to buy a drink for around $3 just to leave the tip. That was really the only issue.  Overall, I would definitely recommend Local as a good place to grab dinner and drinks with friends!"}
{"text":"We came in for lunch on a Saturday around noon. We found out they were serving a brunch menu. I was hoping for a full menu since it was our first time here. The brunch menu was small. I ordered a burger. It came with choice of regular fries, sweet potato fries or breakfast potatoes. I chose the regular fries. My husband ordered the nachos. My burger was cooked perfect but it came without any condiments. My fries were room temperature-borderline cold.  My husbands nachos were good. They had hot sausage mixed in. He liked it but I was not a fan. 
The restaurant has a very urban feel. My husband and I were definitely representing the senior crowd. We're not 50 yet,but we were the oldest here by 25 years. Thankfully we are young at heart and willing to try new places. We will definitely come back to give it a second chance when a full menu is being served."}
{"text":"I went here with my friend and the restaurant itself it pretty nice. The upstairs patio is really cool. We got there during happy hour so our beer was only like two dollars when its originally $8 which was nice. I got the chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries to eat. The chicken sandwich was fried in a beer batter and it was so greasy the breading was falling off it wasn't that great and the bacon on it wasn't seasoned or anything it was just average. The sweet potato fries were strange it was like they made them out of the skins of the potato they were really thin. My friend got the grilled cheese sandwich with pot roast and she said it was really garlicky and the seasoning didn't go with the food. I probably wouldn't eat here again I would come back for happy hour though."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Local by a friend who has since moved to California. :( We met for lunch on a nice, sunny day and as it was late afternoon the place was pretty empty. We shared a margherita pizza and I must say they have hands down the BEST margherita in the city. The crust is perfect, it's thin with a great mix of cheese, tomatoes and basil. Too many of the places I visit tend to sprinkle what looks like 5 pieces of basil across a large pizza. Not Local.

My only complaint is that it always takes forever to get a pizza. I've been here a handful of times, and it's the same every time - 40 minutes to an hour. Kind of ridiculous, really. First time I took my boyfriend, raving about their pizza, we ended up waiting close to an hour and a half because our first pizza was burned. Fortunately, we were in good moods and our bartender was mixing excellent drinks. It also helped that the manager came out himself to apologize, took our pizza off the bill, AND upgraded it to an entree size (we originally ordered the smaller one). AND my boyfriend ended up loving the pizza and we were back the next weekend. :D

I like going and just hanging out at the tables or at the end of the bar nearest the windows, even when it's not nice out. I love fresh air and, of course, South Side has excellent people watching. I hear this place gets hopping at night, but I wouldn't know as I haven't been out to South Side at night."}
{"text":"First off. The music on the top roof is so Loud me and my boyfriend couldn't hear each other even talk. Second. When our waitress walked up to us I said very friendly \"hi!!\" I was gonna say happy Easter ( because it is Easter) but before I could finish my greeting she literally said... \"Do you want brunch or lunch. If you want brunch you need to order your food now or the kitchen will get pissed.\" I was so mad I'm pretty sure I turned bright red. I literally just asked my boyfriend right in front of her if he wanted to even still be here. She noticed I was pissed and then became a huge sweet heart, afterwards. I asked her to turn the music down and she tried to do something about it. Worst experiences I'vel ever had at local. Really disappointing because it was easter and I spent it in the hospital with my grandma and I wanted a good lunch with my boyfriend and we did NOT get that. But she did change her attitude so I was grateful for that. Happy Easter..."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars for the overall experience. If I just want to rank it from a pub/bar perspective, it can get 4. and for food ... 1 or 2!
The ambiance is good and specially the upstairs deck is nice in the summer. Our waitress made a mistake with our food but she was very nice and changed it as fast as she could.
The food ... SALTY! even after we asked them to go easy on salt we basically couldn't eat the fries. For appetizer also we got a flatbread that was extremely salty.
all in all, eat somewhere else and go here for drinks."}
{"text":"I was in there last night mark improvement from other times I've stopped in fast friendly service keep up the good work I give good reviews as well as bad"}
{"text":"Usually come for drink specials and artichoke dip. It gets beyond busy on the weekend so I never go then. I like it in the summer mainly because if the windows in the front that open up."}
{"text":"Well the best thing about my lunch here was the Irish coffee. Jameson and Bailey's, I felt like a king. Then things went down hill. Our bartender was very unenthused and didn't seem to know how to crack a smile. I felt like we were bothering the kid the whole time. We ordered spinach artichoke dip as a starter, and a caeser salad with steak plus a Greek salad as entrees. The salads were ok but the one was loaded in dressing, the steak was cold on the caesar. I get that it's a salad but how did they make the steak cold, I've never had that outside of a convienence store. Did they cook it yesterday? Then we got our appetizer, about 10 minutes after our entrees. Our spinach artichoke dip lacked only two things, spinach and artichoke. It was just cheese and cream. At least the pita was good. Our bartender never once apologized, oh well, I guess they just aren't built for lunch, or food."}
{"text":"Props to the staff at Local who were so nice to us when my husband and I brought our two young kids in - thanks for your great service and for making us feel welcome!"}
{"text":"Monday night dinner.  Very few people.  Slowest service ever.  Ordered smoked wings, they tried passing fried wings TWICE then said they didn't have smoked.  When food did finally come, we were underwhelmed.  If we didn't have Groupon we wouldn't have come here.  Will not be back....,"}
{"text":"It's Sunday funday in Pittsburgh and if your at the stage in your life where you can wear leather or enjoy brunch then bring your hungover squad to Local for the cure.
The music is amazing and there are sports playing on tvs and projectors through out the bar.

I had the local famous breakfast sandwich and it did not disappoint. The rest of the squad got breakfast burritos, French toast and pancakes. It could be the mimosas that got them smiling but I think the food got the job done too."}
{"text":"The menu here is extensive and relatively cheap considering the surrounding area. Stopped in on New Year's Day to a full bar and impeccable service. We were greeted with water and Tim happily made us a delicious mimosa carafe. Next time we are visiting we will gladly come here again. Local is the place to stop on Carson street!"}
{"text":"Local Bar has everything going for it.  It has a prime location on the South Side, it's clean, it offers a variety of indoor / outdoor seating options, the food is tasty and the staff is friendly.  All that said, I am completely ambivalent about the place.  I don't know what it is.  Perhaps it's the $9 appetizers and the fact you can't even get a simple salad for under $8 or maybe it's something else like the atrocious South Side parking situation.  I don't know really.  Hm.

I'm definitely willing to give it another try, but considering the numerous other dining options on the South Side, this is getting put back towards the bottom of the rotation."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in one afternoon for a local beer. We sat right next to the open garage doors. Not a lot of people there, mainly because it was 3pm on a Monday. We had a great waitress who was very attentive. We tried a couple local beers. They had a decent list on tap and in bottles. It was a great little spot to hang out and people watch!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm. Y'know, for a place that is laboriously trendy, you'd think they would have dreamed up a more inspired name. 

Finding out that LB+K's kitchen had caught fire from the blatantly distressed, remorseful owner himself when last we visited created a tender spot in my heart for them. So without brunch plans this Sunday, Kay and I decided to give them another shot early in the afternoon. 

When strolled in, we were told to seat ourselves and noticed that the joint wasn't exactly stirring with activity. In fact, no one was eating anything yet.

Our minds were set on trying their brunch. Kay ordered the Eggs Benedict, I ordered the Steak and Eggs but was told by our petite server Tee that they were out of steak.

So I went with the Local Pittsburgher, a burger with caramelized onions and a fried egg along with raw onion, tomato, lettuce, and a few pickle spears. 

Ehhhh, I dunno. My patty, which I ordered medium, seemed to come out well-done. The egg, like the patty, was a little overcooked as well. The bun tasted slightly stale. However, the fries that came with the burger were crispy, soft, and were pretty accomplished over all. 

Dessert consisted of a block of tiramisu that came off as a thawed-n-shipped, not local, creation. It wasn't deplorable, but I could probably get something just as good out of a supermarket freezer. 

I definitely picked up a hipster vibe as young urbanites gravitated towards the window seats in order to be seen. The decor was kind of \"rough\" like a warehouse loft apartment.  

Regardless of LB+K's lack of activity this afternoon, the service was slowwww goin', man. 

One male server was apparently a bit, uhhh...cheeched if you feel what I'm gettin' at. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPvZ173xNnw

The female servers both wore brushed-on black leggings in order to display the contours of their buttocks, create an illusion of  waist-down nudity, and therefore bring in the male big-spenders. 

Sweat pants are worn for comfort also, so I don't care to hear that defense. For what it's worth, the guys wore baggy jeans. Those are comfortable too. The girls don't wear those, however, since nobody stares at an ass obscured by loose denim. Is that what they want me to do? Gawk at booty? I was with my girlfriend! Even if I wasn't dining with Kay or was single, does management want me to think a nice tip might *ahem* get me somewhere with a waitress?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvbETP7LM74

Does the dress code come from above? 

I suppose I feel insulted a tad since my libido's expected to give way to logic in these instances. I also find it a bit degrading for the help involved.

Nonetheless, I generally tip well out of sympathy for the service industry and due to having a big, dumb heart. Solidarity.

I was rooting for LB+K. Meh. 

P.S. Tee was a nice enough waitress, and I wager our long wait was more the kitchen's fault than hers. 

P.P.S. For those who like booze with their brunch, Mimosas and Bloody Marys are available. 

P.P.P.S. Kay's Eggs Benedict was easier on the eyes than any chick in tights. Nice plate job, dude."}
{"text":"This place really does it right. They have a small but focused menu, and the food is pretty basic: burgers, wings, pizza, and a few sides. But you can tell that they do everything from scratch and the quality is outstanding. I dare say the burger is better than Fatheads right down the street (also a great burger). Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Awesome food and drink selection. Extensive menu with lots of local favorites and well-known traditional bar foods. Cheap but delicious. What more can you ask for? Grabbed 3 seats at the upstairs bar during the Steelers game (if you know Pittsburgh, you know how unlikely this is). It was definitely busy but it didn't impact the service. Bartender knew about all of the 20+ tap beers and got us everything quicker than usual. Ordered the honey BBQ wings, fries and the Fried Chicken Sandwich. House chips were hot and crispy. Great place to be for Steelers Sunday!"}
{"text":"One time is all it takes to know you been somewhere great. Local is no exception. The name comes from the fact that the majority of items they serve are procured from local vendors (farms, breweries, ect). That's no gimmick though as they won't let you down on quality, taste, and unique surprises. I say unique surprises because their menu is loaded with uncommon, foodie friendly dishes. I've never been crazy impressed with places serving pierogi until here. And when you read over the dessert menu and find cheesecake stuffed pierogi don't run, but give in; you'll be glad you did 'cause they are BOMB! The hummus is a winner as well as the burgers and flat bread pizzas. Yes, all with an uncommon offering of toppings and style. They also have a great selection of drinks on tap. While I didn't take the opportunity to visit upstairs, read the other reviews and see that the rooftop deck is pretty sweet. I'll be going back to have my own experience there."}
{"text":"this place is a little more laid back than some of the \"clubs\" on the south side, in my opinion. it gets just as busy at night, but it's a little hipper. i went here for a drink and appetizer the other day. we got the red pepper hummus and it was delicious. the service was good and the price was alright. what i really liked was the atmosphere, kind of steam punk hipster, with a large open window right in front."}
{"text":"Local is a new Southside favorite  by a lot but not me.  It is ok but gets wayyyy to busy on the weekend. Good luck getting a drink.  The food is pretty good but not excellent."}
{"text":"This is the place to be on the weekends! It gets packed on Fridays and Saturdays and it's a two story bar. The food is pretty good but it's most popular as bar on the weekends. It is right in the heart of Carson St!"}
{"text":"I ate here with my boyfriend one night and we sat upstairs in the patio.  The atmosphere was decent, we might have enjoyed it more if the night had better weather.  Our drinks were solid, but our food was just okay.  I ordered the steelworker, and I thought I would really like all the things going on with it, but I could hardly eat it.  It was falling apart all over the place, and the burgers had so much seasoning that it was clashing with the Mac and cheese (which by itself would have been pretty good).  I really just picked at my food.  The service was okay, but pretty slow.  The one thing that we really liked though was the Brie and apple chutney appetizer we ordered, it was perfect!"}
{"text":"I'm a bigger fan of this place for the drinks, location and vibe on Carson, but Damn those soft pretzels!!"}
{"text":"I went to Local when it first opened, both to eat, and as a bar and came away in both instances with overall, \"meh\" feelings. Basically, it was okay, but not blowing my skirt up. The front window and rooftop seats are great for summer and quite appealing. 

On a recent trip back for lunch I have to report my skirt stayed in firmly in place. I ordered the mac n' cheese app as my lunch with a side of their veg of the day--green beans. My husband got a cheese steak with fries, as did our friend who joined us.  First off, the waitress came back and said they were out of fries... WTF it was 11:30 on a Friday morning? So they got the chips instead. Overall, the food was fine, ho-hum, it was lunch and the portions were nicely sized. My husband and our friend finished their meals and said the chips were \"okay\". I didn't finish my food, not because it was bad, just too more than I needed.  

Would I come back to Local? Maybe, if it wasn't crowded and I just wanted something simple..."}
{"text":"The food is ok. To be honest it's a nice location and cool place to hangout for drinks. Decent happy hour specials and sitting near the open windows is nice as well as the roof top deck."}
{"text":"The rooftop bar was pretty nice. Our simple cranberry vodkas from both the bottom bar and rooftop bar were fine, but I then asked for a vodka soda with a splash of lime. I'm not sure what I was given but it was undrinkable. I think I may have been given straight lemon juice with a splash of vodka. It's normal to have a hard time getting a bartenders attention but I felt it more so here than I usually do."}
{"text":"Service was slow and the food wasn't good.  I ordered a sandwich and the bread was soggy. My boyfriend ordered boneless wings and described them as \"Applebees level\". The drinks were okay."}
{"text":"Because this restaurant and bar is located very close to my house, this is a common spot that my friends and I meet up. However, every time I go for a meal or drinks, the service is horrible and the food is underwhelming. There have been many instances I've experienced where the hostesses are rude, and then the waitresses/waiters get easily irritated. For the price of the food and drinks, I expect more!"}
{"text":"Good happy hour spot! They have half price domestic draft beers and half price select appetizers. My friend and I split three appetizers for dinner, and it was definitely enough food. We had the pretzels, quesadilla and fried pickles. My favorite of the three was the pretzels. They have an awesome mustard and cheese sauce. I highly recommend for happy hour."}
{"text":"Food was good for brunch, can't complain about that. The service on the other hand, leaves MUCH to be desired. The waitress stopped by maybe once after our meals were ordered, after that, only to drop the check. I'd love to say this is the first time to happen, but I've come to expect the lack of service when I'm here."}
{"text":"Local is generally on my rotation in the Southside.  I think it's moreso because it's the current \"new\" spot, and I like to see the talent that Pittsburgh has to offer.  If the crowd sucks, I likely wouldn't come back.
I've been here for: lunch, dinner, & late night.  

Food review:  I love the concept.  If I were going to open a restaurant (someday, hopefully) I would open a place similar to Local.  The sandwiches I've had were really good, but seriously, if you're going to use giant bread/buns, the middle (meat, veggie, etc) between the bread probably shouldn't fit entirely on 1/3 of sandwich.  Fill the bitch up, or use smaller bread...it's like a short guy buying Magnums...you're not fooling anyone.  

Beer review:  How do you have such a weak tap selection when you have a very solid bottle selection?  I don't get it.  Get better draft beers.

Night life:  On an attractiveness scale, the clientele is better than average.  Not mind-blowing, but hey, it's Pittsburgh.  As others have said, it can get a bit douchey.  Also, when I'm drinking at night, I like some mood lighting.  But upstairs, I feel like I'm under a spotlight...wayyyy too bright.  Turn down the lights, I'd rather be surprised at 2am that disappointed at midnight.  I do like the big-ass fan upstairs though.  Downstairs, I like the open windows...I wish more places had this \"feel.\"  

Hopefully they go uphill & not downhill...I will be back."}
{"text":"The food was inconsistent. The omelettes were massive and what you would expect (other than the random corned beef hash pieces in the veg omelette... yikes). The other portions were reasonably sized, but my food came out room temp. The Bloody Mary bar is very well equipped, and the crafts of mimosas are well...  standard. Services was also friendly yet pretty absent. Would probs only come back if there was a strong majority pushing for it."}
{"text":"I've gotta update my review based on the fact that the food has gotten MUCH better! So much so that I crave the salmon asparagus salad with delicious horsy dressing all the time now! I could walk out with a vat of that stuff and be a very happy girl!

The salmon is fresh and cooked perfectly, or should I say seared to rare perfection. The lettuce is nice and crisp and the asparagus is grilled and flavorful. It's a winning choice. 

I also tried their hummus, which is served with warm pita bread. It had a really distinct lemon flavor that I loved. I was surprised how much I liked it!

I'm also impressed at their draft list now. With almost 26 beers on tap you really can't go wrong. If you're  like me and love a nice cold beer outta the tap instead of a bottle youll love the selection (yay for Great Lakes on tap!). If you're worried about the way the place turns at night I urge you to stop in during the day or for dinner and check it out. I really think you'll be surprised. 

Oh, and the rooftop patio is still awesome!"}
{"text":"The service upstairs was HORRIBLE on my first visit and then decent on my second (but only because I had such low standards after my first experience). The food is pretty good and the outdoor patio upstairs is awesome, however, being that there are a fair amount of options for outdoor seating in the area, I'm not sure the patio itself can make up for the lack of service.

I should note that service downstairs is usually pretty good, so depending on whether you prioritize sun or service, you may have a better experience."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place overall. The bartenders were attentive and kind, which can be a rarity on the southside. Drinks were good; however, i could tell the margaritas  were made from a mix. (Big, huge no no).  Oh, no mint. So if mojitos are your bag,  not a good place. 
Got the hummus appetizer, and good Lord. My grandparents always said to eat oatmeal cause, 'it'll stick to your ribs\". Well, so will the hummus. Its thicker than oatmeal, and certainly thicker than putty. 
Ill give Local one more try, but my advice - steer clear of the hummus"}
{"text":"Been back a number of times since my first review, and the service has really improved! Great Happy Hour special, too - $3.75 drafts, inc. a wide variety of great craft beers. Shout-out to Al, very attentive server even when busy. Still loving the porch, great spot to enjoy the 'burgh."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Terrible service.  Borderline abysmal service even.  They weren't even busy, it just appeared that the bartender had more important things to do, like talk to patrons and staff, and text on her phone.  I'll go back, but only because the food was good."}
