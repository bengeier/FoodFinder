{"text":"I ordered a vermicelli bowl with 2 toppings (fried meat ball and spring roll) for $6.99. The spring roll was pretty small and it was mostly taro in it. There weren't a lot of noodles so the portions were on the smaller side. 

The tom yum noodle soup was spicy but the portion was ok. 

We wanted to order a sago dessert and were told that the kitchen was too busy to make it. The restaurant was less than half full and it was 8:30pm so we didn't think our request was too much. We understood that there was only 1 server but we would have been ok with waiting a bit for dessert instead of being denied completely. 

We will not be back."}
{"text":"The menu is a mixed variety of different regions/country, I 'm very confuse don't know what best to order.

My husband ordered \"Pho\", and I ordered chef special Curry Lamb with Nan\" It's suppose to be best. 

Pho's soup is not so great, Curry is good. It's small portion that's why the price is fair not cheap as the other restaurant.
The worst thing I would say is only 1 star or maybe no star. I couldn't eat well, I never go to any restaurants to see the owner yelled loud at the waitress that she \"poured her rice!\" (it's mean that she makes her lost business.....) and it's not ending there, when she goes back to the kitchen I heard her voice yelling and bullying at the waitress again! I really want to stand up and tell on her face to shut-up I'm eating,
I'm full of angry to see the owner insulting the waitress. 

Come 'on, We live in North America, our responsibility is to train well the staffs not to insult them. 

My meal was awful with full of angry!

{"text":"Great little mom & pop restaurant. The Pho is one of the best in Scarborough, you can choose dry or fresh noodles but the MSG content is a little high, so prepare to drink lots of water afterwards. Try their butter fried chicken wings, it's godly and much better than anything you can get at conventional pubs. Decor is nice & new, service is great. This could be my new 'go to' pho place in scarborough."}
{"text":"Inexpensive restaurant, yummy food,  fast and excellent service. Try the ginger milk curd for dessert, they make it right at your table."}
{"text":"First off, if you plan on going here, here are some tips to finding the place:

It's located in a plaza with other stores. The name \"Yummy Vietnamese Cuisine\" is not visible at all on the storefront. You will not be able to see the name from the street. It's in the plaza that has Go For Tea as the corner of the plaza. The biggest english name on the restaurant is \"Sing Viet Thai\"

FREE WIFI - It is available but you have to put in a password - which is the store's phone number (10 digits)

PRICE: The first thing I noticed was the price. All the dishes average around $6 bucks for a meal. That is AMAZING. Definitely worth multiple visits to try their numerous menu items for such a low price.

FOOD: I ended up ordering the Malaysian Shrimp Noodle soup $7.99 along with the Vietnamese Spring Roll $3.99. I was hoping the rolls would come out first but my noodles did. It had a yellow star and a few peppers on the menu indicating it was a favorite and had some spice levels. When it came out, it looked beautiful. However, in terms of flavor... I was a bit disappointed. Broth was aite - not spicy at all, not rich in any specific flavor, and the noodles were just too much. Half way through, it felt like I was just eating noodles with no flavor. I would not order this dish again. The vietnamese spring rolls were aittee. 

Overall, I would definitely check it out again to try something else on the menu. Great price range for lunch or dinner with free wifi"}
{"text":"Food wise, it would be 3.5 to a 4 stars place, but everything else was really bad.

It was 7 pm and only 1 other table with 2 people at the time. After reading the menu for a little bit, and the two dishes we like to order are in the special meal selections, which include a soup + dessert, so we order the meal for 2.

We decided on the tom yam kun soup, and the 2 dishes were Thai style green curry chicken and curry beef brisket. And we \"added\" a rice flavoured with chicken oil, and an order of roti.

The soup arrived, you don't see the usual button mushroom, it had 2 - 3 small white beech mushroom, it's the one that sells for like a dollar a box, with 30 - 40 of them in it. And the soup had some red & green bell pepper, and 2 shrimp. Oh and it had the whitest(?) part of a celery pieces in the soup. The greens floating on the soup that looks like green onion was actually green chilli peppers, so other than spicy hot, I couldn't taste anything else.

When the dishes arrived, it doesn't come with any rice, roti or bread. After a while,  the waitress brings a small bowl of rice, and 2 small roti. Roti were in the smallest size you find in supermarket's frozen food section.

Because the order were much smaller than we expected, so we look around and see what others are having, and we saw that if you order the dishes not from the special meal selection, you get a big pile of white rice for free (include in the price), while the special meal has to pay more money for less!!!

Just as we thought we probably would get a bit more than others as the meal include soup and dessert, so we ask the waitress to get us the dessert and bring us the bill, we were then told they don't have dessert. Not in a form of \"sorry we are all out of dessert now\", but rather \"we don't have dessert now\".
When asked that is it because they don't make some of the dessert on their dessert menu in winter time? She replied \"no, we have those.\"

Well, we basically got ripped off. Because we don't see anyone else order or received any dessert, it was only 7:45pm by the time we left, on the meal selection they said it include dessert, but we didn't get anything as dessert, not even a piece of fruit, nor a piece candy.
But if you would order from the dessert menu, they said they have it and would make it. (Then again, I am not sure if they will just come back after a while and say they don't have it and still charge you for it.)

YES, we were charged the full price even they didn't give us dessert. And not even an apology about it. I would never go back to this place, and I don't think anyone should."}
{"text":"The pho soup base was bland. I ordered the large pho and it was mostly noodle with a small smattering of meat stuff. I came away with a stomach ache. I came here as I was in the mood for pho and let's just say, if you can't already tell, I came away unsatisfied. Maybe their non-pho items are better as it seems like what other yelpers are raving about?

Service was ok and our large-ish party was seating fairly quickly on a Sunday afternoon. It's pretty difficult to get seated quickly in this neighbourhood on a Sunday afternoon, so I guess this accounts for the 2nd star."}
{"text":"This new mall is awfully bland. There's a few restaurants in here, but this one seemed a best choice for me, and only met for a quick lunch. 

They advertise Sing Viet Thai food. I had a vermecelli with Lemongrass grilled beef. For $5.99 you can only choose 1 type of meat. Other $ you can choose more. 
It came quickly, the noodles were not dry, but the beef was not as many as I had hoped. 

It's 2pm on a Saturday and I am here because I am waiting for my doctor across the way. They have free wifi here, and I would recommend it as opposed to the Starbucks in the nearby plaza. (Wow, I went in there with my laptop, and every single table was there filled with a young asian person, white ear buds and a laptop). I would bring your computer here and order a nice mango shake and chill out without the crowd."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: small, seats like 30 people, typical Asian place

Food: 2/5, I ordered their tom yum goong beef noodle, broth was bland, few slices of beef. 

Overall: probably won't be back, there are way better Asian food in the area"}
{"text":"Food is reasonably priced, but quite bland.  Ordered a large pho here, there were way too many noodles and not enough soup.  Noodles were also very soft and seemed overcooked, not my preference.  Bf had chicken curry with rice, it was too much coconut flavour, and not much curry.  His sister had some seafood udon, it had a lot of seafood and veggies in it but too much MSG."}
{"text":"There is definitely a lot of yummy to be had here at Yummy Vietnamese Cuisine. From all the pictures posted on Yelp I found the Malaysian Shrimp noodles to be most visually pleasing and I do like my shrimps so I had to try it. I'm very glad I did too. The shrimps were really large and fresh and it was cooking in a tasty broth which looks very spicy but really wasn't spicy at all. There were two types of noodles that came with this dish, one thin and one thick. I personally think they should just serve it with the thick noodles. Overall a great dish for $8, 4/5 stars. I also tried the chicken skewers and found them to be only okay when compared to there places like Thai Basil. The dipping sauce was really lacking in flavor but still okay.

After finishing my bowl of noodles, my brain didn't register that I was full so I call the waitress over and ordered a second meal; the curry chicken with roti. She gave me this look and said in Cantonese - so my noodles didn't satisfy you? I immediately replied - No, no the noodles were great. It's just that I'm a big eater. She smiled with delight and brought the 2nd dish within a few minutes. I found the curry sauce was lacking in some flavors but still pretty good but what was most disappointing was the chicken meat. I was mostly given chicken bones to eat. However, my disappointment was overcome by the freshly made roti/flat bread. It was so light and crispy and had lots of flaky layers. Every bite you can hear the sounds of crispiness. I polished this off pretty quickly because of the lack of meat and washed it down with a nice glass of HK style milk tea.

Overall a good place for a meal

3.5 stars"}
