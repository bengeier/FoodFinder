{"text":"Very happy to have good Chinese comfort food steps from my house. The dishes were fresh and flavourful; the spring rolls were excellent. Will be going back to try more dishes in the future!"}
{"text":"I was not very impressed with the food here, but my two dining mates did not complain. I went with a 3-star because it is possible my lack of enjoyment was because one in the party does not like spicy food so we ordered dishes with no spice. I found the food to be incredibly bland.

We shared the pad thai, pineapple chicken, and beef and broccoli. The pad thai was the most bland and very different than your typical pad thai. The beef in the beef and broccoli was kind of tough. I enjoyed the pineapple chicken the most but it was a pretty standard sweet-and-sour chicken dish. 

Service was good. I may or may not be back to try some of the spicy dishes."}
{"text":"Bon petit resto asiatique, service courtois et  rapide, prix très abordables. Il y a une belle petite terrasse à l'avant du restaurant et l'intérieur est très propre. Nous y retournerons sûrement!"}
{"text":"Nothing innovative here, but reasonably priced comfort food, executed perfectly is not common. I hope this place sticks around. Excellent food, excellent service."}
{"text":"Ordered sesame beef and general tao chicken for delivery. It was horrible! They were both ultra soggy, both meats were very dry, half the general Tao chicken pieces were dough only, no chicken."}
