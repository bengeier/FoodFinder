{"text":"Hmm 2nd visit wasn't so good.  I ordered the salmon bibimbap on quinoa.  First off, they didn't have any quinoa so had I order rice. I should also mention I came right at lunch opening so it's not that they had ran out, they just didn't have any although it's listed on their menu.  Secondly, the rice was cold and crusty. Lastly, the salmon was dry and rubbery.  Suffice to say I didn't enjoy it at all.    

I am willing to give them another chance, as they say third time is the charm but perhaps I will steer clear of the bibimbap and try the bulgogi cheeseburger, solely for novelty purposes."}

Came here twice, both times for the signature Korean sandwiches because I had TeamBuy vouchers. Both times the wait was ridiculously long, especially for a take out place. Might as well have a sit down lunch if its going to take that long, at least I wouldn't be ignored. Didn't help that both times I was given my order later than people who had arrived and ordered after me. 

Thankfully the food was pretty good, particularly the bulgogi cheeseburger with kimchi. You can request hot sauce on the side if you want to add some heat to your sandwich. The second time i went they had chairs at the counters so you could actually sit and eat. 

Both times I received a bit of salad in my box: the first time it had carrots and dressing (which unfortunately made a mess on the sandwich wrapper which was placed in the same box). Second time it was a small bunch of undressed salad greens. 

Don't know if I would go back and pay regular price.. Certainly not until they improve on service and speed!"}
{"text":"It's only been open for three weeks and I had high hopes buttttt it did not turn out well.
there was a shell in my egg and a hair in my box. 
if it was cheaper, maybe still be a good eat, but it cost 10 bucks after adding tofu and egg. 

not the worst thing i've ever had, gets two stars for being fun and cool, but cost and food does not save the location."}
