{"text":"Taqueria yaqui is the real deal. We had the manta ( stingray ) , Cabeza and the chicharron. Excellent! !!!"}
{"text":"This place has brought the hole in the wall to another level. Outside, cash only, no English menu. However, all the tacos we got were delicious. Shrimp, beef, beef tough, fish, roasted pork. There were a lot of toppings on the taco. They are fresh and very tasty. Definite authentic Mexican. And the soup, it is nothing I have tried before. Taste pretty good, not too greasy or salty but very flavorful. Will go back again."}
{"text":"HOLE IN THE WALL...best Cahuamanta ever in Phoenix.  I go there because of the Cahuamanta........this is a very traditional dish form back home. I am originally from Obregon City in Sonora, Mexico. And Cahuamanta originated there. This is exactly as in my hometown. Cahuamanta is a modification or the Soup of Cahuama ( sea turtle) When Cahuama was prohibited due to its danger of extinction pleople subbed its meat with manta-ray. Then the meal became Cahuamanta.  Cahuamanta   can be served as a soup or in a taco. I personally like the taco style. It is ,usually,  place on two tortillas since it is very juicy and the tortilla will break apart because it gets  soggy. It is a good idea to ask one , eat it, then ask for the second one.   The place is just a portal with tables. Not for a first date, more for a cultural experience along with great food. I am not sure if the ladies that take your order speak English but they are the nicest. If your friends are snobs this is not the place for them. Please avoid the ladies a painful moment by having to deal with a snob person.  The restroom is small and there is only one. They keep it very clean.   The cons.........CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos de shrimp and manta (Sting Ray) tacos !! Must try place. Fast and Great service  CASH Only"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Very authentic and tasty! Not a chain, so don't be afraid to explore. Nice people and great service."}
{"text":"Very 'wild' flavor of venison. Usually directly related to what the animal eats. The 'gamey' flavor is more noticeable in the fat.  If you like the 'gamey' taste this place is for you.  Good service and plates have a nice presentation when served. I did not like the flavor of the meat.   Small indoors eating area with their patio holding the most open and largest seating area."}
{"text":"Muchos lugares para comer tacos pero como este no hay 2 están buenísimos (vien perrones) lo único malo es k solo aseptan cash (efectivo)"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, what a find!  Has now become my \"Go To Taco Place!\" and after approximately six visits I am finally writing a Review!  Certainly qualifies as a \"Hole In The Wall!\" Maybe even the holiest in the wall you have ever been to but do NOT miss it, if you love Tacos.  I have tried three only three variations of these Soft Pillows Of Wonderful Flavor, but that is more than enough to know they have it right!  Manta - Afraid to even think of what this fish was when in the water but very flavorful on your Taco with a texture much like Monkfish or well cooked swordfish. Wonderful is the proper description.  Camaron - Small succulent, flavorful Shrimp with all the trimmings including sliced tomato. This is a five or six napkin affair with the sauces dripping off of the Taco, but you absolutely MUST TRY!  Chicharron - Oh my, what am incredible fiesta or taste and texture. Crunchy bits of pork with all the trimming stuffed into the absolute BEST TACO I have ever eaten. I always tell myself I can do three Tacos but only order two and have never been able to order a third. This is the VERY BEST!  Your server will likely speak some English and will possibly be able to answer questions about the menu written on the wall. Possibly NOT. If not, stick to the above and you will definitely have a taste treat not to be duplicated anywhere. Oh yes, your plate will come with cucumbers, radishes and a avocado sauce that is a nice accompaniment.  Cash only, but with a Mexican Coke will be less that $10!"}
{"text":"A true authentic, literal hole in the wall! This place is straight out of an Anthony Bourdain episode. If it weren't for an authentic friend introducing me to this humble looking place, I would have continued to drive past it week after week.  We stopped in and sat on the outside patio in need of a hearty meal, after a busy weekend. I was told that this place is only open on the weekends and that they are known for their Cabeza Taco's among the local Mexican community. I have to say that they hit the spot. They were served with a good amount of meat, fresh sliced cucumbers and radishes on the side, as well as a side of guacamole and fresh made green chile salsa. The corn tortillas are made fresh, and two of these guys will satisfy an appetite.  They also have several types of Caldos (soups). One of which is Birria (Goat), another is Camaron (Shrimp), and a few others.  We ordered a cup of the Caldo Camaron which was great. It was a simple tomato based soup that was full of shrimp. It is served with a plate of chopped cilantro, onion, and lettuce to put in the broth. It really hit the spot after a tiring weekend.   They serve Mexican Coke in Bottles, as well as other Mexican Soft Drinks.  I have a feeling that some may leave bad reviews about this place, but a true foodie who is looking for a simple, realistic Mexican street food type experience will feel the same love and appreciation for this small gem as I do.  Go give this place some support, but please don't be foolish and write a bad review because of how the place looks or the service. Write a review based on what the place is supposed to be , which is a real hole in the wall which is simple and nothing short of authentic.  I will post pics of food after next weekend.  Cheers! :)"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure of their hours, but I pulled in around 4:30 and they said they were open. I opted instead for to go. I ordered 4 tacos, the total bill came to $12.25. All of them were good, including the cabeza. I would like to come back when it is more busy to get a better sense of what is on the menu."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever! Best dollar ever spent! The tacos are small but very tasty. I would say that they are at their best when they are hot, don't wait to eat them. I don't like the nachos or any of the other stuff on the menu. I would say their specialty is tacos and the small beef quesadillas."}
{"text":"If you're looking for truly authentic tacos and great ceviche... you need to try this place! Some seating inside and they bring tables and chairs to put outside. Great food! We will be back!! Check their schedule as they don't open all the time. CASH ONLY!they dont serve anything else but tacos and tostadas but that's all you need! The birria is Devine and the aguachile OMG"}
{"text":"And this is why hole in the walls are the best! Felt like it was a taco that you find on the streets of Sonora"}
{"text":"Had 2 caguamanta with shrimp tacos. Definitely hit the spot for being hungover. They dont serve beer unfortunately and also make sure to bring cash only. Will Def go back to try other items."}
{"text":"Yes, this place is small but huge in flavor! They have tacos de birria, caguamanta, camaron, cabeza, and chicharron! They also have different types of caldos but I haven't had that, YET! You must try it!"}
{"text":"A total hole in the wall but as amazing as everyone has said. Service was friendly, quick and helpful for my non-Spanish speaking family. Pork and shrimp tacos were  both amazing and fresh. The guac was different than I'd had in the past but I ended up pouring it all over my tacos!"}
{"text":"Best tacos de cabeza hands down only reason it's not a 5 star is because they don't serve asada which is weird but that's okay because the cabeza ones are all you need and don't forget a tostada de ceviche! The best!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food in Phoenix! Check it out and try the Manta tacos! I've been to dozens of Mexican restaurants  in the valley and none are as authentic as this place. The salsa is hot as you want or mild for the less daring. This is a regular stop for me and my wife whenever we crave Mexican."}
{"text":"If i had the money i will eat here everyday.  Everything and i mean everything on the menu is so so good.."}
{"text":"This place serves fantastic food. I haven't had anything that I didn't like. All the sauces that come with your plate are great with varying levels of spice/heat. This place is definitely a hole in the wall, but worth a visit if you're in the area. Seating is cramped inside, but there is plenty of outdoor seating if you can tolerate the summer heat."}
