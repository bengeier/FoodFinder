{"text":"I have enjoyed Indian Spice Kitchen on several occasions. I can report that the owners have added labels to the food with general descriptions as well as indications of the level of spiciness. If you need further help anybody will be glad to assist.  An assortment of meat dishes (mostly chicken) has also been added to the menu, though it remains largely vegetarian. I am also quite pleased with their reasonable prices. Indian Spice Kitchen also features a nice salad bar and a small but scrumptious assortment of desserts. All is included in the price of the buffet, although they also feature a traditional sit-down style menu (available on their website). If you are in the mood to stay home they also deliver!  All the food has been quite delicious, and the freshly prepared naan is delivered to the table in a never ending flow. The staff is very friendly and prompt with serving their customers. Dishes are cleared from the table by the time you get back with a new plate from the buffet.  The atmosphere is very relaxed and enjoyable. The tables and chairs are sturdy and kept quite clean, including the spotless white linens. The washrooms are well maintained. I believe the dining area has separate overhead ventilation, so as not to inundate customers with smells from the kitchen/buffet area. I have never noticed any, apart from my own plate.  I have introduced several friends and family to Indian Spice Kitchen and they have all enjoyed themselves. I look forward to introducing more people to this hidden gem! If you have not yet been, what are you waiting for? Bring your appetite because you will not leave hungry!"}
{"text":"I was really pleased to finally find an Indian Buffet place in Toronto where you eat  worth your money, or even more than that! Tucked away on Markham Rd, this place isn't located at a place where you just read the sign board and walk in. I was recommended this place by a friend, and after delaying for several months (not a big fan of Indian food), I finally decided to give it a try.  The buffet is pretty extensive. Fans of Indian \"chaat\" and \"paani puri\" won't be disappointed by their decent spread. The Tandoori chicken is just perfect. It is soft and succulent with the perfect combination of spices. There are several vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes to choose from. However, the Chicken Xcuti (thats what the hand written label said) is a must try. It is a curry based chicken with mint and coconut, and is definitely my favorite Indian curry now. The Lamb Curry is equally good. Hot naans keep coming as long as you want them, and surprisingly, you can have Dosas as well. Just ask the sweet little lady at the counter, and your table will be loaded with hot, crispy dosas. Needless to say, there's unlimited sambar and chutney too! The Gulab Jamoons for dessert are easily the best I have had in Toronto, although I wasn't impressed by the Carrot Halwa. The service is good and the people there very polite. Unlike some buffet places where the tardiness in clearing plates is a major bugging factor, here the plates are gone by the time you are back with your next load.  The whole place is really neat and well kept. The environment is relaxed and they play Bollywood songs at a volume that's just right. If you are remotely interested in Indian food, and would like to get stuffed at a price that's hardly anything,you really need to try Indian Spice Kitchen."}
{"text":"Good North Indian buffet at reasonable price.  Lots of variety dishes on the buffet counter. And you can self-serve your own \"paani puri\"  Foods are somehow bit too spicy and aromatic... however, the tasty meals are a fulfilling experience."}
{"text":"This place was mediocre at best the food for some reason does not taste like your typical Indian food. The spices are either too mild or overly done for dessert there was not a great selection the only thing that stood out to me throughout the whole meal was the gulab jamun by far the most delicious I had. Prolly won't repeat."}
{"text":"The food is excellent for an All You Can Eat restaurant. Price is incredibly reasonable. Definitely on the spicy side, but that's good in my opinion, better than being too mild. Will probably be back to order take out the next time."}
{"text":"Food is really good here an very inexpensive. There should be more people here but guess it's not a good neighborhood.   If you are getting buffet you can try a little bit of everything. When I order I get the butter chicken (of course) and it's really good.   A tip is to come early because since there are not too many people here if the food is good they don't make more.  The ambiance is simple and nice, good for sit down. The family staff is nice and friendly and attentive. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet changed to all vegetarian recently (great for me!) and the flavours are amazing. There are so many options for an Indian buffet with a fresh salad bar, always hot fresh naan and the rice is perfect. The food temperatures are great and the service is friendly. All you can eat for $9.99... you can't beat that these days! Every time I've been, there is next to no people there. I have no idea why, it should be packed! Well I'm letting you in on this secret so you have to go and find out how great it is for your self! :)"}
{"text":"Resteraunts like this are exactly why I like Scarbrough. This place is clean, fast inexpensive and delicious. The atmospher is fairly chill and the staff are polite. Unless there is simply no pleasing you or you dont like indian food then there is nothing to dislike about this place. They did slip up ONCE however, I ordered out and nearly choked on a clear plastic band in the food. You NEED to watch out for that KITCHEN STAFF. Your stars will drop like flies if that happens again."}
{"text":"Went there first time last night. The food is all labelled now, and very good. Hot and spicy but, hey, that's in the name so it's expected. I thought the $8.99 price for dinner was a typo (maybe that $ is a 1?) but it isn't. Unbelievable price for an excellent, all-veg delicious and healthy dinner. I've also been to numerous Indian AYCE and the naan bread here was the best I've ever had. I'll be both recommending this place and eating there often! Thank you for finding it, Mishy. :^)"}
{"text":"Indian Spice Kitchen is pretty cool. Located in a weird area, away from solid restaurants, and I don't count the Bombay Palace as 'decent'.  The system is mainly buffet during lunch and everything is offered in relatively smaller portions at the buffet table and frequently refreshed.   They have an appetizing assortment of salads and DIY Chaat, about eight to ten vegetarian mains and about six to ten meat options. They also have a well-used tandoor.   I would give this place 4 stars but many of the mains were very hot and spicy. Obviously, I should be well-prepared bearing the name, but heartburn after a meal is not really my thing."}
{"text":"For Indian restaurants, this place is very good.  All the dishes are cooked differently than those found in more popular/typical Indian restaurants like Jaipur Grill on Yonge or Cuisine of India.   Arrival:  I ordered takeout. They took a long time.  They seem to be short staffed and I had to wait a while.  I have to admit it was worth it.  So, be aware and plan for it. Food:  It was very very good.  We ordered a wide variety of items.   Our favourite were the veggie dishes.  The butter chicken gravy was super good but you could tell the chicken was pre-cooked and then warmed in the sauce.  It should have cooked in the sauce for better taste.  We actually ordered 2 chicken dishes and the meat tasted the same in both.   Overall:  A very good experience.  We ordered too much and had leftovers the next day which were just as good."}
{"text":"As a former vegetarian, I normally don't mind vegetarian restaurants.  I just prefer them to have more choice of dishes to fill in the protein gap left behind by all-veg meals.  The curries were standard Indian buffet quality, if not spicier.  There were some 10 choices of the usual paneer and dahl curries.    I didn't particularly enjoy runny curries with not much substance and vegetable curries with vegetable cut so small that it resembles a mush.  They also offer a strange fried noodle dish that's a cross between chow-mein and singapore noodles which I thought was a strange offering in an Indian restaurant.    All in all, this place was a 5/10 at best and even with its proximity to home, I'm not sure if I would return for a second helping."}
{"text":"Finally went here after living in the area for almost a year! It was good. I was there a little early (it must have been like, 4pm on a Tuesday) so they didn't seem to have all of the food ready yet. The naan was amazing, as was the butter chicken. The chicken biryani was also very good. Pretty sure I tried a little of almost everything and no complaints here, although none of the food was all that spicy, which was slightly disappointing. Would definitely go back again though!"}
