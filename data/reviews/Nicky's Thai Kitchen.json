{"text":"Went back for a second visit. The experience was 180 degrees better than first experience. They have obviously staffed up to meet demand and while the food has always been excellent, the service now compliments the experience. I would definitely recommend Nicky's Thai and rated them a 4 instead of 5 only because this new location is not (yet?) on No Wait."}
{"text":"First time at the north side location. Sat outside, I recommend, was very nice. Great that it is byob. 
I got one of the specials, red snapper green bean red curry. Snapper was fried and some pieces were a little over cooked but I enjoyed it. I ordered it as #4 on the hotness scale and it was mild. 
My wife got her usual chicken pad Thai and as she says it is the best. She ordered it #6 and it was a little spicy but not overly so. 
Will be back again."}
{"text":"I've heard rave reviews about this place. I LOVE thai food, so I was so excited to try this out. Well, when I was ordering, the waitress asked me on a scale of 1-10 how spicy I wanted my meal (10 being the highest). I like spicy food, but not crazy, so I said 4. There was no way on this planet that my food was a 4. I could barely taste the food because it was so spicy. (Seriously....I went through both mine & my husband's glass of water since the waitress took her time to come back) Like I said before, I like spicy food, but this wasn't even remotely enjoyable."}
{"text":"The worst Thai food I've ever had, but then, what I've had has been pretty good. If it were just that, I'd give this place two stars, but the water glasses are tiny (narrow cylinders with a thick base) , and the indoor dining area has no vents and is very echoey, so with even a small amount of people, it was really hot and noisy.

My husband and I ordered the Pad Thai and Hung Ley Curry. The curry we hadn't tried before. Our waiter told us it was similar to Panang, but creamier. I had told him we like red curries, so I was hoping it was red, but apparently it's yellow (which we don't like much), and the similarity to Panang was the addition of peanuts. We ordered both dishes at their hottest (we've had plenty of beautifully hot Thai food). The food came out really quickly, which seems odd for Thai food. The Pad Thai was super sweet, and therefore not very hot (which our waiter did mention when he brought the food). The tamarind flavor was present, but the dish was still bland and lacked any savory balance. The Hung Ley Curry was even more bland, and the heat didn't really meld with the other flavors (what little there were). It was hot, although I was expecting more based on the waiter's description.

We won't be back. I was hoping Pittsburgh had good Thai food since we can't get any in our area, but the positive reviews for this place make that seem unlikely."}
{"text":"VEGETARIANS BEWARE! Before you order from their \"vegetarian\" menu, ask about what sauces are being used in the dish. Evidently, they don't consider oysters, shrimp and fish meat."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. Best Tom kha soup in the city. Other favorites are the panang curry and spicy noodle. Be sure to ask for brown rice."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - I've only had takeout in the past and this time I made reservations for the back patio filled with green plants and covered with umbrellas so I didn't even need my sunglasses on this sunny day. The tables are close together and the serpentine entrance path is almost single file.

Service - other than having to overcome the language / accent barriers on the reservation the service was in line with other family-run ethnic restaurants with good intentions though lacking in a higher end restaurant polish this doesn't detract for me.

Food - ubiquitous for a reason the pad thai had peanut flavor without the sometimes too sweet ketchup sauce found too often - delicious. The spicy noodles had lots of fresh basil cooked into the spicy noodles and the tofu tasted fresh and did not have any off flavors from the oil which indicates fresh oil. The spring rolls are simple and vegetarian and cut into sushi (maki) style rolls which makes them easy to eat. The fried egg rolls were thin cigar style rolls with a small amount of vegetable filling. Overall, wonderful Thai food and that's what it is all about.

I'd be happy to go back and try more offerings especially the soups on a colder day. For me I'd choose take-out or the patio seating."}
{"text":"Just had the Drunken noodle w/ chicken. They called spicy noodle. Very disappointed!
Comes with thick noodle and big, thick cabbage!!!!
I had a lot of drunken noodle in my life time and this is the worst! Taste nothing like drunken noodle."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in the Burgh.  The prices are great and it is  BYOB.  I've had several of the items and all have been great.  My favorites are the Massaman Curry, Pumpkin Curry, Pad Thai, Spring Rolls, and Steamed Dumplings.  Quaint outside seating area when it is nice out."}
{"text":"Samosas 4LIFE!!!! good food good service cool place, go here on a date. not a place you should let your kids run around in though. BYOB"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food. We went to the downtown location. The crab Rangoon was some of the best I've ever had. When I eat at a new Thai place, I usually order Pad Thai as a test. Nicky's Pad Thai was delicious. Not to dry, not too wet and tons of peanuts and flavor. Pay attention to their website if you're looking for happy hour - it's only Monday thru Wednesday."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite really went downhill.  Ordered the pineapple curry takeout and was SO disappointed.  I got like two pieces of chicken amongst a soup of flavorless pineapple curry and one tiny scoop of rice!  Way OVERPRICED and tasted awful.  No THANKS will not be returning.  Anyways we always have to get take out because it's a terrible cramped uncomfortable spot to eat.  Not worth it anymore. It's worth the drive to Bloomfield to get some better Thai!"}
{"text":"A really great place downtown. Definitely make a reservation if you don't want to wait for dinner. Good portion sizes that could leave you with a little bit of leftovers. Recommend the crab Rangoon and curry dishes. Great atmosphere, very well decorated."}
{"text":"got takeout from there 3 times, spicy basil shrimp, pad thai, chicken satay. it was awesome the first two times, blah the third time. called to let the owner know because i really liked their food the first time, didn't seem to like my feedback.

i'll try them another time before i give up."}
{"text":"I moved to Pittsburgh from one of the largest Thai communities outside of Thailand, Los Angeles, I grew up eating Thai, and I will say this Nicky's is the best Thai food in Pittsburgh flat out.  The staff is incredible, all real nice people, they remember your name.  And even if the restaurant is packed, the service does not suffer at all.  I feel at home at Nicky's, and that is the best complement that I can give."}
{"text":"This is a super place, no doubt!  It's very nicely decorated, and both not too big or too small inside.  The staff are very nice and friendly too.  And the food is truly delicious: we mainly had appetizers (egg rolls, spring rolls, Thai samosas, chicken satay), but also really enjoyed a scrumptious ginger chicken and a heaping serving (not that the ginger chicken wasn't a generous portion) of delectable Thai fried rice.  The drinks were merely okay, not very special - but we really came for the food and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious Thai food.  I sampled my favorites -- Panang curry and Tom Kha soup -- and they were spectacular."}
{"text":"After hearing all about Nicky's Thai Kitchen on the North Side, I had to try the new location downtown since it's close to my work. The restaurant is on the corner of Penn Ave. and 9th, which is close to a few garages if you need a place to park.

Apparently everyone else wants to head to Nicky's Thai for lunch as well, as it was packed when I went today around 11:45 am. If you plan on visiting during your lunch break, make sure you have a full hour - you'll probably need it.

The decor of the restaurant was very pretty with all of the gold statues and such, but the walls are dark, and the lights are pretty dim, so it isn't too bright inside. Additionally, it can be a little difficult to maneuver around the restaurant as it is filled with 4-person tables (I didn't see any 2-person ones). 

The service was mediocre. I understand that the restaurant was busy, and that this is the first week of opening.  I waited longer than expected to get my hot tea, but my food came out in a timely manner. Everyone was friendly as well. 

I ordered the panang curry with chicken for lunch, which came with a side of the daily soup or salad. I went with the soup, which turned out to be a rice soup for the day. It was spiced wonderfully and was loaded with rice. Maybe it was just because I had high expectations for the curry, but I wasn't too impressed with it. The curry wasn't really loaded with many vegetables, just a few pepper and broccoli here and there; however, the lunch portion was a perfect size for lunch. 

My love for Thai food is too much to not come back. They have a decent sized lunch menu, which means that there are so many more items for me to try! Nicky's also does takeout, so that may be an option when I don't have the time to sit for the whole hour."}
{"text":"I always go for the Green Chicken Curry to see what a Thai restaurant can do. It's a dish easy enough to make if you're authentic and know what you are doing, and it is easy enough to screw up to reveal your true (non-) identity!

Unfortunately, for this place, the latter was true... I want to give these guys a fair review, but I have to do this within the frame of my past experience. In that, I think 2 stars are more than appropriate:

The entrance reminded me of how you get into those really cheap backpacker hotels. It is a victorian style house, with a stair case right behind the door leading upstairs. Downstairs, the probably once nice looking wood flooring is replaced with off-white bathroom floortiles. Walk all the way inside, do a U-turn, and then you are in the restaurant - in two rooms that were once sitting and front room of the house. The layout is not my problem, but it is the feel of the place. It really looks more like a day spa than a restaurant, and the floortiles everywhere are not helping. Also the scent candles don't help - especially since I nearly torched my jacket by one of them standing right next to my chair on the floor.

Weird also is the staff. They appear to be locals that own the place, and they were definitely not Thai! The only people that look Thai were barely visible in the kitchen. But maybe they were not Thai. What do I know. 

But what do I know - maybe, I thought, this place looks odd, and the people are not authentic, but maybe they can cook up a storm. Well.... I ordered the typical serum of truth - Green Chicken Curry! And what did I get? A salmon colored vegetable soup with chicken! Dare I ask - I thought - and dare I did. Upon which a blushed response came that indeed, this was the green curry. Also the rice - not so good looking.

However - and this is why I gave 2 stars, and not one - the food actually tasted pretty good! Also, the sticky mango rice at the end, not bad.

Still, for San Francisco prices, with $10.50 for a curry, and no liquor license at this resto I am not sure it would be my recommendation..."}
{"text":"I typically have a great experience at this restaurant.. however, the last few times I have ordered takeout have been sub par to say the least.
Today my boyfriend and I each ordered rice entrees with absolutely no flavor - other than salt!
I know that this is not the standard for either of these dishes and called the restaurant to share this feedback. 
I was immediately hung up on the first time I called.
The second time I called wasn't much better. 
A man who only identified himself as \"the manager\" answered the phone and was completely useless in resolving the situation. 
If I am at work and ordering take-out to begin with, what makes you think I am going to be able to drive 25 minutes just to return horrible food that should have been made the proper way to begin with??!
Honestly, the last few horrendous dining experiences I've had with this place let me know that I will not be ordering from here anymore... as the managers, staffs and cooks just do not seem to know what they're doing!"}
{"text":"Thai is my favorite food, and I have had it in many cities. Nicky's thai is the best I've ever had. It makes traveling to Pittsburgh for work enjoyable just to get to visit Nicky's. All of my coworkers love it too and we count down the days. Egg rolls are great, crab Rangoon is different but very flavorful. And the NOODLE DISHES are out of this world. I typically order Pad Kee Mow, so the drunken noodles are comparable. I have tried approx 6 dishes from Nicky's and all are fantastic- but the Drunken Noodle takes the cake. If I lived in Pittsburgh, I'd go twice a week. 6 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious food, kind and caring staff, authentic atmosphere. I thought I knew what spicy food was until I ordered a 5 at Nicky's- out of 10, but I've heard that they can go up to 20 if you request it. 0-2 is considered mild spice. 3 and up is no longer considered mild. For appetizers, I recommend the Egg Rolls and Samosa, and above all else, I insist upon ordering the Crab Rangoon. I do not enjoy the Spring Rolls. For entrees, the Cashew and Sweet and Sour are staple options. For curry, my favorite above all is the Masamaan Curry, though you can't go wrong with the Pineapple Curry. As for noodles, I prefer sweet noodles, so the Pad Thai is my favorite, but the Phad See Ew is also good, however it's based in a dark sauce, whereas the Pad Thai is much lighter. As long as you're aware of the spice scale, you really can't go wrong with ordering anything on the menu at Nicky's."}
{"text":"Since returning from my trip to Thailand, I like to think I've developed a more discerning taste for Thai food.  Nicky's Thai had been on my list for awhile and was the first place my boyfriend and I decided to try upon returning from our trip.

We walked in without a reservation and had no trouble being seated right away.  The place is completely packed with decorations that look like they came straight from a Thai marketplace...buddhas, apsara dancers, elephants, and peacocks in gleaming gold nearly everywhere you look.  It's a beautiful and authentic space that really sets the mood for the delicious Thai food you are about the consume.

I decided to go with one of the Chef Specials, the Salmon Mango Curry.  Probably not the most authentic dish, but I was still a little burned out on Thai food (the boyfriend was not).  It was a nice-sized piece of grilled salmon smothered with veggies and mango and topped with a green curry sauce.  The amount of mango was a little overwhelming, which made for a very sweet dish.  I enjoyed it nonetheless but would probably choose a curry dish next time.  My boyfriend went with the Massaman Curry with Tofu.  It was full of chunks of fried tofu, potato, and pineapple and topped with peanuts.  Very rich and flavorful!  I also loved that the curry and rice came served in big fancy golden dishes.

The portions were huge, we easily had enough left over for two lunches the next day. I was still a little burned out on Thai desserts, but I look forward to trying their Mango with Sticky Rice and Deep Fried Bananas with Ice Cream in the future.  This is a great little piece of Thailand in downtown Pittsburgh, and I can't wait to bring my friends and family in to experience the exotic cuisine!"}
{"text":"Working in town, I've given this place more than a fair shot, ordering maybe 5 or 6 times, and I'm finally ready to give up on it.  One thing I can say for sure is it's incredibly inconsistent. Almost each time I've ordered the same thing and each time I've gotten a different result; sometimes it's a passable Thai dish but more often it seems to rank with some of the worst I've had.  The main problem here is that it's bland, SO bland that it's practically inedible.  I'm not usually one to order above a 3 in most Thai restaurants, but I ordered my most recent takeout HOT thinking at least some kick would be in there.  The server on the phone told me I did not want a hot, but a medium.  Not quite sure what happened there, or since when servers advise you on what you should be ordering without asking them.  However, since I usually order a medium anyway I rolled with it.  Then I went to pick up my order on my lunch break and the real fun began.  First they tried to charge me $30 because they mixed up my order with another individual's,  Once we finally got that sorted out, I realized my baggy was labeled \"mild-medium.\"  Without the time to try to further explain that mix up and send it back as I still had to walk back to work, I figured it would be close enough and headed back. NOPE. THE most bland dish I've ever had, absolutely disgusting.  I understand it said \"mild-medium\" but there were NO spices at all in the dish, absolutely none.  I'm really quite amazed that this place can stay open between the inconsistency and poor customer service, let alone get the seemingly raving reviews on here.  I'd much rather just wait and grab Thai food for dinner from Smiling Banana Leaf or Bangkok Balcony.  Give this place a try if you're feeling adventurous, but if you're used to real Thai food, prepare to be disappointed."}
{"text":"The thai fried rice is really good except for the fact that I had explosive diarrhea the following hour"}
{"text":"Okay so first off, dumb me. I was craving a dirty martini and clearly you don't order one from a Thai place. I tried any way because there was a martini featured on the drink menu and it included olives. Considering the anticipated and welcomed language barrier from a terrific Thai restaurant, my dirty martini came to the table as the feature martini from the menu which included a lot of basil and olives-not a good mix. That being said the place is small but wasn't too packed for a 9pm dinner on a Saturday night. The service was fast, and the food was absolutely delicious. The beef mint salad is one of my go to Thai menu items and I must say it was by far the best mint beef Thai salad I have ever had. I cannot wait to go back, but definitely not for the martini feature."}
{"text":"Delicious entree of \"Massaman scallops\", a curry that is sweet and spicy, flavored with peanuts and coconut. The server asked how spicy I'd like it. When I said, \"not too spicy\", she replied, \"4?\". Great idea using the pain scale format, lol.  Just right.  Portions are large, in fact as a solo diner I didn't see a starter that wouldn't have been a full meal.
 Two caveats: if you want wine, you'll have to bring it, and they don't take Amex."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner during a weekend visit to Pittsburgh and was so impressed. Probably a few of the best Thai dishes I've ever had in my life. Strongly recommend the gap rap lad kao and phar luck. I'm drooling just thinking about those dishes.....mmmm Thai food....."}
{"text":"I'd been to Nicky's downtown location a couple of times in the past, and I'd had a great experience, but this last time was out of this world. It's my favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. I went with a friend who is new to Thai food and she decided to play it safe and get the Pad Thai with beef and wonton soup. I get what I always get - spicy noodles with pork and Tom Ka Soup, both as spicy as they can make it. (Their Tom Ka is the most heavenly, flavorful soup I've ever tasted. It is SO delicious.) We also got Thai Iced Tea (so addictive) and steamed dumplings as an appetizer, and we both agreed that they were the best dumplings we'd ever had. My friend was initially disappointed in her Pad Thai, because she thought it was far too sweet, but our wonderful server went out of his way to have the dish fixed for her, and when it came back it was MUCH better and less sweet. She was quite satisfied with it. (But in the meantime, she had tasted my soup and my dinner and immediately regretted not getting the same thing I got. Haha) After we finished our meals, we each got Thai Rice Custard - I picked the pumpkin variation with black sticky rice so we could try both. They were absolutely exquisite, as expected. At the end of our meals, we were stuffed full (the portions are huge) and completely delighted with the food, service, decor - everything. We both agreed that this is a five star restaurant all around, and it's certainly the best Thai restaurant I've ever been to. I can't recommend Nicky's enough!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  I told them I was vegetarian and they were very helpful.  I got their veg fried rice and spring rolls and both dishes were good. I thought the rice wouldn't spicy enough and the waitress told me medium would be spicy. She was right! It was perfect. If I ever come back here I would definitely come here! The staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, as much as I like saying \"I'm a big fan of authentic Thai food\" I have no idea what authentic Thai food tastes like. However in my mind, I imagine this has to be pretty darn close to what they offer at Nikki's!

I've ordered take out twice and each time thought it was excellent! I started ordering curry dishes a few years ago when I decided Pad Thai was probably too safe a choice. Since then I've had it all over the city and I can say Nikki's is probably one of my top choices. They also don't hold back when you ask them to spice it up. I'm a fan of extremely hot dishes. On my first order with Nikki's, I went with a medium spice....it was way to mild for me (although it put my wife's mouth in pain for the rest of the day!). Today, I went with the hot and it was definitely kicking. Next time I think I'll try the extra hot and make myself cry home.

While I haven't had a chance to sit down inside, the restaurant looks very cool. Plenty of Thai paraphernalia all over the place and brought back some great memories of being in Asia.....or at least the Asia section of Disney World's Animal Kingdom (although I'd like to do the real thing soon).

Anyway, the moral of my story....go try it and don't play it safe with Pad Thai, they've got a lot on the menu that looks awesome!"}
{"text":"excellent and I will keep it short and sweet:

1. Cozy, small and quaint dining room, 2. tremendous ginger chicken  with pleny of meat and spice, 3. attentive service with timely refills of my ice water and 4. reasonable and fair pricing

I highly recommend this place as many others do.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great Pad Thai...pumpkin and black rice dessert eh ok. Nice service."}
{"text":"I found this place with the help of Yelp and it did not disappoint.  Nicky's has a dark Thai-themed atmosphere and the service was excellent.  Of course, the food is why I came here and my two selections were both worthy of receiving 5 stars.  The appetizer sampler, featuring six different appetizers and four sauces both looked and tasted great (and feeds 4 people).  And for dinner, I ordered the Chicken Mango salad.   While I wouldn't normally order a salad as an entree at a Thai restaurant, I'm glad I did as this was probably the best salad I've ever eaten (and a great value too). There were so many things in the salad that I'm hard pressed to describe all of the contents, but rest assured that you'll be satisfied and will likely have enough to take home for a second meal."}
{"text":"This is a very special place to find incredible, authentic Thai food.  Everything i've tried there has been of superior quality.  The restaurant has an ambiance of peace and good will.  The authentic art work everywhere gives a special feel of Thailand.  The wait staff is extraordinary and this has become my very favorite restaurant. Try the Crab Rangoons, the Mango Curry or Pineapple Fried Rice.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the outdoor patio-just beautiful and a very nice place for date night wth the hubby
Pad Thai is very good and the dressing in their salad is delish"}
{"text":"I got the Basil Duck and a Thai Ice Tea. The tea was watery, and the duck had been breaded and fried, and was coated in a thick sauce, and basically could have been any kind of meat. Perfectly edible, but not really a $25 quality meal.

On the other hand, service was great."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing food!
I was visiting Pittsburg from New York with friends and this meal was perfect for dinner.
The pork dumplings and tom yum soup were stellar.
Also wish we had known before, it's BYOB!"}
{"text":"Nicky's is my favorite spot in this neighborhood. Always great food, always great service. I would highly recommend the red curry, or fish with green beans. The Thai toast (appetizer) is also noteworthy."}
{"text":"We went here for a birthday dinner with 11 people and a baby!  It was tight but cozy. The staff was incredibly accommodating.  They have a broad menu - the Hung Ley and Pineapple Curries are excellent. Staff was knowledgeable and attentive. We also liked that they have a bar but offer the option to byob."}
{"text":"Okay so I've given Nicky's Thai a few chances and the keep letting me down. 

Tonight was the worst though.  We wanted a quiet Valentines Day dinner at home so we ordered take out from Nicky's.  After they made us wait an hour after it was supposed to be ready they forgot to add one of our meals! With no apologies.  We waited an hour and a half for cold thai food and were made to feel unwelcome. 

Mediocre food, apathetic service. Stay away!"}
{"text":"The best Thai in the city hands down. Curry and noodle dishes are as good as it gets."}
{"text":"This place was great! Having been to and love Thailand, this is one of the best to real Thai food we have found around."}
{"text":"Comparing this place with smiling banana leaf, I think Nicky's has more intimate and romantic setting and price is also a little higher. Both places have good tasting food, but at Nicky's the presentation of food is a little better."}
{"text":"We now have a great downtown Thai restaurant!  We've been there twice and it was really great both times. Last night we had the seafood tam ka soup with a coconut base and a beautiful mix of vegetables and textures spices and heat. 

Have to pause to comment on the heat. We love spicy food, and this place will make some seriously spicy food. They have mild, medium, spicy and Thai. We got the soup \"spicy\" and it was really hot.  Not so hot that it blew away the other flavors, but definitely pushed us right to the edge (which I personally like in a first course). I'd recommend that most of our friends who don't enjoy the pleasure/pain of beautifully spicy Thai food should stick to \"medium\". 

Main courses were spicy tofu eggplant which was really nicely done, with fresh tofu that was in strips not little cubes, which made it hold the sauce like a pasta, and nicely smooth eggplant. I had a barbecued chicken on skewers served with a really nice vegetable slaw with spicy lime juice Thai fish sauce. Ordered it medium and it was great, the chicken was like tandoori , a little smoky and tender. I'd definitely order it again 

They don't have a liquor license at this point, and (I'm surprised to to be saying this) it did not matter at all. 

The decor is really nice, one of my favorites, and a very nice place to take guests when you want them to think downtown is pretty cool. 

Not cheap, but not expensive,  all combined we have a great new downtown thai place, a new go to choice. Go, keep them in business, they deserve it!"}
{"text":"In sum, lovely and cozy place tucked back into the North side. If it is nice outside you MUST sit at the outside patio. The food has been inconsistent between the two visits I had here. Sadly, that is not very encouraging. They do offer affordable lunch specials and I believe the scenery alone is worth a trip.

I work in the South Side, driving over to Nicky's on my lunch break is easy peasy. What I really come here for is the unique outside seating. Sitting in an office all day long with very dirty windows makes one long for the sun and wind. I love all the pretty greenery on the patio at Nicky's, the large umbrellas to block the fierce afternoon sun, and enjoying the mini vacation while sipping on the most excellent iced Thai green tea.

The service here is S-L-O-W. I am salary, I can bite this bullet from time to time. Yet, I wanted to put it out there if you are pressed for time, one might consider stopping elsewhere. In their defense, we always bring at least a party of 5. Perhaps, the slowness is due to the party size?

The iced Thai green tea, if you are not familiar, if quite delicious. It is a yummy concoction of brewed green tea, spices, and milk. If I had to venture my best educated guess I would say I could taste a bit of star anise. Maybe ever-so-slightly a bit too much of it? Methinks the aftertaste is quite unmistakable. The milk is a nice touch, I think it might be condensed milk as the sweetness of the tea is something a little more than mere sugar alone could bring about. I typically do not take milk in my tea, but this drink has me reconsidering. Quite a refreshing beverage to drink on a hot, sunny summer day as it was today.

I *technically* kept my word. I promised when I wrote my last Thai review, for The Smiling Banana Leaf, that I would something other than Shrimp Pad Thai- my go-to entree at any given Thai restaurant. Well, I did not order it, but I did order two appetizers I have already had before! Come on, it was lunch I did not want to overeat and go back to the office =)

I choose the crab rangoon. Rumor has it, this is an island dish. Naw, I am not buying it. This totally sounds like a made in the U.S.A type of dish. Do not get me wrong I am a complete sucker for it and will order it when I see it on a menu. This rangoon was a bit disappointing. The filling was perfect, sweet cream cheese, scallions, and crab. But the wrapper needed another moment or two in the fryer. It was only partially crispy. I was bummed.

For my other appetizer I ordered the soup. Another go-to Thai soup I love is Tom Kha soup. Now here is where it get very depressing. I never considered that one could scold coconut broth. However, after eating this soup today I am convinced this phenomena can happen. The shrimp was presence lacked in my opinion (two of them). The plus side, they were large shrimp. The fresh spices were sparse, for a medium heat level this was not medium. 

A lack of spicing took me back. I have ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai at a medium level before and I felt like a horse diving my head into a water trough the way I was throwing down glasses of water. I either caught this place on a bad lunch- else their standards have slipped since I came here last summer. The jury is out on this one..."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last four days and the experience was amazing both times.  Both the pumpkin and pineapple curries were perfectly spice with just enough sweetness.  The tofu was cooked just right.  The Thai Island Ice Tea was inventive and delicious too.

Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Delicious food, quick service, and a BEAUTIFUL garden in the back if it's warm enough to eat outside. String lights, fountains, the works."}
{"text":"Upon my arrival at Nicky's Thai Kitchen, the atmosphere was loud, yet energetic. It took a fair amount of time to be seated, but we were waited on right away. We first ordered the Pork Buns (the full name currently skips my mind) which are a popular Thai item. First impressions: the flavor of the sauces inside the buns were excellent, however, when reaching the pork itself, more than 80% of it was chewy fat; this was consistent with the rest of the buns and I ended up scraping the fat off. Thinking that was just a fluke, We ordered a noodle dish and a curry dish, both with the steamed chicken. First impressions of the curry were all pleasant, until you bit into the chicken, which was like biting into leather. This seemed to be a trend in both dishes. We ended up picking out the pieces of chicken, because they were unworthy of saving. To summarize, this place left me extremely disappointed, especially considering the fantastic reviews. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"8/15/17 I called the restaurant to order takeout for dinner.  I ordered Thai styled fried rice with shrimp and crab fried rice with shrimp.  I also placed a separate order for my friend of Thai styled fried rice with shrimp.  The total of my order was $42.21 and my friend paid $16.08.  When we picked up our order there were two small containers in my bag along with a small foil packet with about six little shrimp on two sticks. We asked if anything else came with this and the waitress said no that's it. No soup, salad or even a fortune cookie in the bag! The shrimp were small and skimpy and the rice was dry. Instead of making a scene, we just paid and left.   My friend said that she orders lunch from here occasionally and she gets the same dish and it comes with a soup or salad and the portion is the same as the dinner portion but it's just in a different container. She paid @$10.50 for hers and I paid @$21.00 for each of mine.   Totally Ripped off!! No stars from me."}
{"text":"This restaurant was top notch! The dinning space was clean and nicely decorated.

The food was by far the best part! Everything tasted fresh and was promptly served.

GREAT VEG FRIENDLY RESTAURANT!"}
{"text":"Whoever is in charge here does their job with a lot of love apparently.  The decor is beautiful, with flowers on every table.   And the food is presented beautifully as well--every dish looks like a work of art.   Once you decide that it's time to stop looking and start eating, well, then the real artistry shows.  I had the spicy green bean and peppers and it was seriously some of the best food I've ever tasted.  I'm a huge fan of Thai food, but probably not an expert, but it was my favorite Thai experience so far (including restaurants in LA and NYC).  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, good food and excellent service. Have been here several times and remain a loyal customer"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place downtown! We usually get food to go and it's great! The fried rice and pad Thai are my favorites!"}
{"text":"Food has gone downhill since I was here last. Food was bland, smaller portions, and took forever to come out of the kitchen. I wouldn't come back if this is the standard operating status now."}
{"text":"While the food was okay Thai food, the management there is awful!  I called in a to-go order and was surrounded by the 4 eaters I was ordering for.  They all heard my clear order, which I repeated at the end of our phone conversation, but when I arrived and checked my order it was a mess.
1 entree was missing, 1 entree had the wrong protein & 1 appetizer was missing.  Unfortunately, they swiped our credit card right before we thought to look through the order to make sure it was all there (tip from fellow yelper on this same restaurant) so they charged us for the wrong entree and the missing app.  
When I politely asked that she remake the entree with the wrong protein she told me I was wrong, that's what I ordered and I had to pay for it, but they would make me a new one with a new price.  Worst customer service I've ever encountered and I will never go back there.
Also, glad it was a to-go order because the place is really cramped and loud."}
{"text":"Somewhat authentic Thai food, but more hype than substance ---  Very Very inconsistent seasoning. Curries sometimes too sweet. Sometimes the heat is too much --- spicy is NOT the same as hot! --- Since when is Sake, Teriyaki, or Wonton Thai? Why use canned pineapple?"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, i really do!!  I went with a group of 6- nice atmosphere, really friendly service--but my food, it was ok.  I wanted it to be great! This was my second visit, the first time I sat outside in July, which was beautiful.  Inside is cute too.  First time i had pad thai, this time i had the wide flat noodle with tofu...it just tasted like egg--everyone else said the food was good to 'meh'.  I gave 3 stars because the food wasn't great, but the service sure was."}
{"text":"I have been to Nicky's several times because I want to love this place. But, I just don't. The food is decent and the price is comparable to what I would pay for a dinner. But the food just doesn't knock my socks off and the place is cramped and noisy. 

This last time was my last straw. We had made reservations two weeks in advance for 8 o'clock. When we got there we found that we weren't the only ones with reservations that night and it seemed that most people weren't getting seated. We were told our table wasn't ready. After 15 minutes we pulled the 'we have a babysitter and she won't wait' line and got a table about 5 minutes later. I know that I wasn't the only one with reservations (people were being vocal about the situation) and others had probably been waiting longer, but it ticks me off that the whole point of having a reservation is so that you don't have to wait and then you end up waiting. And it isn't like they have a nice place for you to wait. 

We ordered the Fried Tofu as a starter and I got the Tom Yum seafood soup. The soup was fantastic and I thought that would prove to restore my faith. But the fried tofu was not as stellar. I ordered the Shrimp Red Chili for the entree and it was not worth the $15 price tag. There were about five shrimps and two pounds of bell peppers. The sauce was also ho hum.

Sorry Nicky's. I will be exploring other Thai options in the future."}
{"text":"Great service! Exceptional Asian pumpkin red curry with shrimp! And loved the appetizer platter! Try the hot ginger tea with honey bourbon...ooo baby!"}
{"text":"Great good in a beautiful, outdoor atmosphere. Lots of Buddhist imagery. Relaxing, covered seating on the rear patio with lots of flowers and fountains. Very unique setting. Indoor seating is also available, but you'd be missing out."}
{"text":"Loved the food.. It was spicy as expected and great to taste. Good authentic Thai food. The only problem is that the restaurant is  too cramped up if it gets filled.. Hardly any place to move around. Other than that  its worth going there for their awesome food."}
{"text":"Alright thai food, but excellent service and great ambiance. Very cute garden area. 

Insides of my fried samosas were cold, tofu in my noodles was kinda soggy. Wouldn't order these items again. The egg rolls and noodles were good though and it's nice that you can customize your spice level."}
{"text":"Very good! Service was excellent, and staff was very friendly. The food was delicious, just the right amount of spice. The restaurant from the outside did not look that inviting, but it was acceptable for that area. The back outside patio, where I ate with my family, was beautiful. It was very peaceful and there were some small birds flying around. Overall I was very pleased with the experiance and would go back again."}
{"text":"One of the best pad Thai dishes I've ever had.  My friend got a curry dish with an 8/10 spiciness level, and it was delicious!  

Excellent service, tasty food! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal in the courtyard.  Great way to end a weekend in Pittsburgh.  Pumpkin custard w/ sticky rice was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Just arrived in Pittsburg and yelped this Thai restaurant which is walking distance from hotel. Crowded even at around 9pm on a Sat. Ordered the shrimp cake, basil mussels, green curry and lad nah. They were all DELICIOUS! I'm Asian and have had my fair share of Thai food from Bangkok. I must say this is close to authentic except for the spice level. BUT, you can always choose spice level 10 :)"}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Pittsburgh.  You can't go wrong with anything you order here."}
{"text":"Was not overly impressed with Nicky's \"downtown\", was at their Northside location a few years back and found that to be much better. 

I will say that we loved the Tom Yum Soup (with chicken), we also ordered the Chicken Satay which was good.  Service overall was good, staff was attentive. 

Daughter ordered Pad Sew Ewe, but that is not what they brought her (later on I commented to my husband and he said that he saw the staff taking other meals back to the kitchen and they must have messed those up also). 

I enjoy spicy food, however I order mine to be a 3 (out of 10) and it was a bit too spicy.  I was able to eat it, but would have preferred a little less heat.  

I really wanted to have a good Thai dinner because we don't have a Thai restaurant close to our home and we absolutely love Thai food.  I don't think I will be back to Nicky's if visiting Pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"Great food! Tom Yum soup was yummy, Chicken satay appetizer was also very good. Ordered two entrees for three of us, pineapple curry w/chicken and pad sew eaw (sp?)....both were very good. Loved the flavor combination of the pineapple curry, and the pad sew eaw was delish ( not to sweet like i've had at other thai restaurants). Service was right on, staff is very attentive and we were there during prime dinner hour on saturday. Would definetly come here again if in the area! Bill came to about $60, which i feel is very reasonable.  Reservations are probably a good idea if you want to be sure you'll have a table upon arrival."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with another couple for dinner.  The place was PACKED, and I was very glad that my friend had made us a reservation.  We were seated about 15 minutes after our reservation time, but that wasn't a big deal.

The food was quite good and reasonably priced.  We have a sampler appetizer platter, and everyone had different curries for dinner.  I had the Massaman curry (red curry with potatoes), which was good, but could have used a bit more variety of ingredients.  It was basically just the curry, chicken and potatoes.  My friend had the panang curry, which gave me a bit of food envy.  I think I'll order that the next time I go to Nicky's.  The spice level requests are a bit of novelty too.  We had different curries ranging from a 5-8.  There was a noticeable difference in the spice levels, but even an 8 wasn't spicy to the point where you couldn't taste the other flavors in the curry.  I might go for a 6 or 7 next time.

It's BYOB - I'm a huge fan.  We knocked down a couple bottles of wine and some beer during dinner.  The only real negative of the evening was that they asked us to give up our table for a large group coming in who had a reservation before we were done drinking... I suppose I can forgive them for that."}
{"text":"Visiting from San Francisco... This place is excellent... We had pumpkin curry (which was really acorn squash), dumplings, tom yum shrimp soup, and thai iced tea,. They know how to adjust the heat so that you can handle it.  Refreshing food that will cool you in the humidity and warm you in the cold.  Pleasant ambiance."}
{"text":"Not open for mid day 3-5 ... If your slow then let people take breaks makes no sense at all to close for 2 hours. I was really looking forward to eating there or lunch and was highly disappointed to find out the staff was just chilling out and not waiting on people. I will not come here again unless they change this policy."}
{"text":"Went To Nicky's Thai Kitchen in the North Side on a Thursday night, made 6:15 reservations for 2.  Was greeted and seated promptly.

The good:  We got chicken satay as an appetizer and both enjoyed it.  As his main entree he got pad thai with chicken at a \"spicy level\" of 4 and I got chicken noodle soup-- it was a cold night, so that sounded really good to me.

We both enjoyed our food, but neither one of us was particularly impressed.   

Our server was attentive and prompt, our water glasses stayed filled, dirty dishes were cleared quickly. 

I think the space is interesting--it's obvious it used to be a home-- but I have to admit, it wasn't very comfortable.  Seating was cramped and the room got very noisy, so it was difficult to have a conversation.

There is only one bathroom (which needed some cleaning attention) and I was only in there briefly before someone was knocking on the door to get in.  For me, that's a problem.  I like to take my time in the restroom, possibly fix makeup/hair, check teeth, that sort of thing, and being rushed to get out by the next person really chars my cupcakes.

It's BYOB and they charged a $5.00 corkage fee.  I've been to other BYOB places in the Pittsburgh area and this is the first place I've been to that charges a fee higher than $3.00.  I know it's only $2.00 more than other places I'm used to, but I brought Casillero del Diablo Pinot Grigio which has a screw top, so paying $5 for a corkage fee really seemed unreasonable to me.  Maybe I'm just being picky.

We had tickets to see a performance of A Streetcar Named Desire at the New Hazlett Theater nearby, so I chose this place because it was convenient and other Yelpers seemed to have good things to say about it.

My assessment:  I will probably never go here again, if there's another event I wish to attend at the New Hazlett anytime soon I'll try to find some other place.  I like to be able to talk to whomever I'm with and I need a restaurant to offer me something exceptional for me to return.  There was nothing exceptional about Nicky's.  

My advice to you:  If you're looking for a dining experience that's just \"meh,\" go ahead."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to town and Nicky's Thai Kitchen is the first restaurant we tried. We made a reservation easily enough and sat outside in the garden. The atmosphere was really great, the service was friendly, and the food was delicious. 

The spring roll appetizers and the coconut ice cream we had for dessert were the highlights for me, though everything was very good. And even better, it's BYOB!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch based on recommendations read on yelp. I was not disappointed. The food is excellent. I found the staff to be polite and efficient. If you like Thai food, I don't know how you could go wrong."}
{"text":"Usually i like to have red curry or green curry but that day i wana try something new so i ordered wild curry i dint find it my cup of tea i ask them could you please change my order & they spoke with there manager and they are very good in customer service they change my order & then they serve me Red curry."}
{"text":"I have been to Nicky's Thai Kitchen two days in a row. The Tom Khan soup and brown rice is the best I've had.  Their spin on Tom Kah is to add cabbage and carrots in addition to the traditional ingredients we consume at other Thai restaurants.  Both visits were outside of the normal rush hours of lunch and dinner.  The restaurant was extremely busy when I showed up at 1:15 PM on a Wednesday however by the time I finished my soup, there were only 3 active tables (plus mine).  Staff is always running around busy.  My experience during both visits was good."}
{"text":"Always solid Thai Food at Nicky's.   Portions are substantial  Curries are excellent.  I always go for their Tom Kha Gai - a meal unto itself.  Pad Thai solid.  Service is friendly.  Arrive early for lunch or tables are a problem.  Reservations for dinner on weekends adviseable."}
{"text":"Love Nicky's, easy to walk to if you are in the historical district or that area a quick drive from downtown. Definitely a must if you like a nice atmosphere, good food, at a reasonable price. 

I ordered the spicy noodles with beef (it was spicy) at about a 2. So watch the spices when needed 

It cost me and my gf about 26 bucks for a nice meal and a nice place just a small walk from home. Everyone has to go!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places downtown.  Great atmosphere.  Great staff.  Very good food.  

Living downtown is a treasure for your taste buds.  There are tons of options, and many are excellent.  Nicky's is our go-to place for Thai though!  Food is fresh and well seasoned, and also very reasonably priced.  It's right in the middle of the Cultural District so a great place for people coming in for a show to grab some great food.  Can't recommend this place enough!

A few tips:  Make a reservation if it's a busy night in the theaters and on weekends.  They also tend to go on the spicy side, so a '5' at Nicky's is an '8' at most places.  Consider yourself warned!"}
{"text":"It was good, but expensive and the portions were small.  I don't see why people rave about it.  I think people who say it's the best Thai in the 'Burgh haven't been to every Thai place in the 'Burgh."}
{"text":"Although a bit noisy but food was awsome.  Samosa where good , and pineapple fired rice was yumee. Would definitely visit again to try other stuff"}
{"text":"Love this place my favorite restaurant to go to. So glad that it so close to home.   Never get tired of their food."}
{"text":"The patio was delightful!  An urban oasis tucked away in the back with room for several tables, featuring a fountain, greenery and many statues (angels and Buddhas alike).  Perfect for summer evenings, with enough umbrellas to protect from the rain.

As for the food - also delightful!  I had a green mango curry, which contained plentiful amounts of mango, vegetables and tofu.  The spice level was a bit higher than I was expecting for a \"2\" but it wasn't too firey.  A great Thai experience in a peaceful setting."}
{"text":"The food is consistently beyond expectation but I consistently find 4 inch black hairs in my food. The first time was excusable but its getting ridiculous."}
{"text":"So far the best thai food i have had in Pittsburgh, the Pad Thai is really fantastic.  Either pork or chicken, cant go wrong.  Also Massaman Curry and the Penang are great as well.  I usually get take out since but have eating in the restaurant.  Nice outdoor seating in the warm months, but inside it can get loud.  The only negative aspect of the menu i can think of is that the appetizers are nothing special and can be skipped and the spicy level is not consistent between dishes.  You can request the spicy level you want but a 7 one day might seem like a 3 another day.  Food is still great though!

FYI bring you own beer/wine.  There is a bar on the coner that sells six packs and also a wine bar close buy where you can grab a bottle."}
{"text":"I've heard positive things about Nicky's Thai Kitchen downtown, and when I was checking the website for their weekend hours was super excited to discover their northside location with an outside patio! Whaaaat a disappointment. If you don't read this further, Pusadee's Garden on Butler has everything Nicky's has +10000, go there instead!

I was relieved when I got a reservation for 2 outside on their patio on a Saturday night calling as late as 5 to make it, and that was the most rewarding part of our experience! When we arrive (the area is really quaint around it), we stood infront of the hostess table/ entry to the kitchen for at least 8 minutes while so many servers bustled infront of us. We hate to be the rude people who butt in, but it really did make us feel uncomfortable standing there without being acknowledged! A simple \"hey!\" would have totally eliminated the awkward situation. Eventually someone said \"YA?!\" to us and I explained our reservation, they crossed a name which might have been mine, and we were told to wait 10 minutes until they were ready. The wait wasn't long, but once we were seated on the patio (nothing compared to Pusadee's..very loud, a little tacky, just overdone) it was another 10 minutes before someone came over and just flat asked \"Ready?\". We ordered our app (6 spring rolls the size of a string cheese) and it took another 15 minutes and talking to 2 separate people to get our bottle open (BYOB 5$ on weekends). The food came via some other server, 15 minutes passed, and a different one came and tried to take our plates when we were still eating. The food itself was decent at best, the pad thai was wet like other people have described and the sweet and sour chicken was food court caliber. Between the poor/ lack of service, the mediocre food, and the overwhelming patio, we won't be going back. We will appreciate Pusadee's a lot more our next time around."}
{"text":"I'm new to town and wanted to find a Thai restaurant downtown. There's hype from my office about Nickys being a great cozy place for lunch or dinner with amazing Thai food.

My boyfriend and I ordered the Pad Thai with Shrimp as well as the Red Curry with Pork. We choose to have one entree come with a basic chicken and rice soup that had minimal chicken or rice but filled with strips of ginger. Our other entree came with a salad that had something similar to a french dressing with a hint of fish sauce, a slice of tomato, a small strip of mango and one chunk of canned pineapple with iceburg lettuce.

I would have much rather skipped these two appetizers and saved room to try a dessert. 

Our Pad Thai was a reasonable portion size but I was thrown off by the short broken pieces of noodles that tasted like they were soaked in fish sauce. Ew. The shrimp was fine, nothing special. 

Our Red Curry was a typical Thai restaurant portion size. A small bowl serving of rice was placed next to a soup bowl of curry. The pork pieces are not fresh and the curry had peas and carrots, most likely from a frozen bag, with some bamboo. The actual curry tasted like coconut milk mixed with water.

Our sever was nice and our water was refilled frequently. I asked for additional spices on the side which he was able to bring out quickly. 

Not sure what the hype is about or why the restaurant was a packed house. I'd never go back and now I need to find some real Thai food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I've been here for three times but I haven't been to the patio yet. I'm really looking forward to come here again and enjoy their outdoor seating!

As for food, I think it really depends on what you order. For the first two times, it was good but not great. The third time, I came here with a few friends who really loved this place. We had the spring roll and papaya salad as appetizers. Both of them are pretty good, the papaya salad was really fresh and tasty. The texture of papaya combined with a little bit vinegar and peanuts stimulated my appetite. As for entrees, we had tom kha hot pot, soft shell crab, duck curry, crab fried rice, Spicy Basil Fried Rice, and some kind of tofu(?). The tom kha soup seems simple, but it's tasty if you like coconut. The spicy basil fried rice was so good that though I tried not to eat carbs, I still had quite a lot. Soft shell crab was a must for my friends, and they are good."}
{"text":"Just had a way overpriced dinner there with coworkers. We were given a small dish of rice for the table to share, when we asked for more we were told no problem, then they stuck it on our bill with out telling us. Before we were even done they kept trying to take our plates away , I work across the street from this place and will NEVER go again. I worked in Hospitality for 15 years, definitely not just being mean. They up charged for whatever they could and forced us out the door with out a line. I've had better food as well. NOT WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"i have been spoiled by really good thai food in nyc.  this place is ok.  i like that there are levels of spiciness but i find the system wholly inconsistent.  our main courses and spiciness levels were as follows: chicken phad thai (7), duck basil (8), and beef panang curry (8).  

the phad thai was ok and not spicy.  the crispy duck had some good flavor but it was supposed to be in a spicy basil sauce and there was hardly any sauce and also was not that spicy.  the panang curry had good flavor, lots of sauce and the spiciness level was like a 10 - not even close in spiciness to the other dishes though it was supposed to be the same level as the duck and slightly higher than the phad thai.  i can accept some variation in the levels but not radical variation.

we also had the surprise combo which is a combo of tasty appetizers that comes with a variety of sauces.  this is good for a group.

service was very attentive, which was appreciated, and the courtyard is really cute except for the legions of slugs on the wall.  one slug was under the table and fell on the person next to me which was pretty gross."}
{"text":"This place is great. Very flavorful Tom Yum soup with veggies. It was spicy and flavorful with tons of veggies. Service at the bar was attentive. Panang curry with chicken could have served 2 and I wished I wasn't at hotel so I could have brought back leftover. Good find for sure. $38 tab for 2 glasses of chard, soup and meal. Very good!!"}
{"text":"This was our second take-out experience at Niky's!  Both times the food was good, the first I ordered a level 7 and it was equivalent to mild wings in spice.  This time I ordered the Spicy Green Bean chicken spice level 10.  Much spicier but still not overwhelming.  This is one of the better places we get take out for lunch during the work week!!"}
{"text":"I can't understand the great reviews. This place is adequate but there's much better Thai food to be had in Pittsburgh, such as Green Mango.  

I tried the Phad Thai which was OK but the shrimp were way overcooked. I also tried the Panang curry which is one of my favorite Thai dishes. Theirs had some hotness from the spice which was fine (I asked for level 5) but in terms of flavor it was bland and runny compared to what I've had elsewhere. 

It is a very cute little restaurant and definitely has some charm but I found the food disappointing and I'll have to see if I'm going to give them another chance to win me over."}
{"text":"The bar is beautiful with granite and wood in deep rich tones. The food is delicious, but I knew it would be from previous visits at their other locations. The staff is extremely attentive, especially Bee who's very pleasant. The interior and exterior design is well put together and inviting. If you like Thai food you will be very pleased with this restaurant. Word to the wise; if you like your food very spicy, get the 4 and ask for extra spice on the side in case you need it ;)"}
{"text":"The food's pretty bland. First time I went there, I asked for my curry to be \"Thai hot\" (meaning make it like you're making it for someone Thai, not watered down for American palettes). There was no heat.

Next time I went, I told the waitress that last time I ordered, I said \"Thai hot\" and got bland. She seemed surprised and well, maybe the last waiter just didn't hear me? Ok, so, just in case the last waiter didn't hear me and they actually do know how to do something other than bland, I told her an 8 out of 10 on the spice scale. Yeah, no. I poured in some chili powder and ate it. 

I usually order medium spice at my local Thai place in Maryland. Nicky's hottest setting is like eating ramen noodles by comparison.

If this is the best Thai food in Pittsburgh, I'm really glad I don't live in this city anymore, because clearly Pittsburgh doesn't know Thai."}
{"text":"Always just so wonderful! Our favorite in the City. 
Met there for our first date and every anniversary since. Great service, always great food, wonderful atmosphere especially when it's warm and sitting outside."}
{"text":"Yes I liked the food. This was my first time here, so ordered little less than intended. After tasting I liked it and looking to go next time as well. The dine place is some what crowded and small. So prefered the takeout."}
{"text":"Our owners went here with some friends on a lovely Saturday afternoon. Mom almost  invariably gets chicken pad thai at thai restaurants around the city, so her opinion serves as a great barometer for us cats. Dad like to try new things, but also appreciates the standard thai curries. They had been to the North Side location many times, always touting its glories to fellow thai-lovers. Dad got the black chicken, intrigued by the rum sauce and ginger. Dad should have known his own tastes better, as perhaps the strong ginger taste did not suit him. He does not blame anyone but himself...Mom liked her pad thai. Our owners' vegetarian friends ordered vegetarian things, but one dish came out with chicken (often not eaten by vegetarians, but loved by us cats). Our owners' friend was a very flexible vegetarian, as he was ok with eating it anyway. I am sure many vegetarians/vegans would not be as cool about it. The lovely ambiance of the cozy North Side location felt a tiny bit cramped in the downtown location. Our owners decided that they perhaps would choose other Thai restaurants as favorite in the city (Smiling Banana Leaf, we're looking at you), but that Nicky's has always been an excellent choice as well. Thanks! Meow."}
{"text":"Nicky's is great.  Thai is me and my boyfriend's go-to food when we don't know what else to have.  They have the best Pad Thai I've ever had.  In the warm weather, request to sit outside, you may have to make a reservation or call ahead for this.  It's absolutely gorgeous in their outdoor section."}
{"text":"Every time I have been here- I have been in heaven.  This is my favorite Thai spot with Toi Thai in Los Angeles as my second.  

I have enjoyed several trips to Nicky's when I am in visiting my family (Living in LA now) 

What I get: 

Green Curry (chicken, or veg), Pad Thai (chicken or veg), cheese wontons, Papaya salad.  I have tried the Red Curry too, but green is my fave.  All of these dishes are pure GLORY.   I've even had the Pad Thai without the soy sauce because a friend of mine is Gluten intolerant and...ummm it's still the BEST. 


I am getting hungry writing this and too bad it's on the other side of the country! 

I told my dad about this place and he goes every time he's in Pittsburgh now! And taunts me with text messages about how good it is! LOL  

It's small inside, but I don't even care. It's divine. If you have to wait for a table there is a bar right on the corner. You can go enjoy a beverage and they will call you when your table is open :)"}
{"text":"After bemoaning the fact that I had a not so great Thai lunch a few weeks back, I got some messages from fellow Yelpers that I should try Nicky's Thai Kitchen.  This place is only half a mile away from my North Shore office.

It's tucked away on a beautiful block of Western Avenue.  I would have driven by this place had it not been for my GPS alerting me to the fact that it was on my right!  I lucked out and got a parking space right in front of the entrance - street parking only, no lot, so factor that in to your lunch break if you are like me and on a tight schedule.

I got there about 12:45pm so it wasn't quite the lunch rush.  Good thing because there are just a few tables for dine in service.  They were doing a very brisk takeout service.

I went with my old Thai standby:
- Pad Thai with chicken and tofu, medium spice

It was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious.  I asked for the spice tray which was very comprehensive: Sambal, Thai chiles in fish sauce, dried red pepper flakes and something else I couldn't identify (sugar? that doesn't make sense but that's my guess).  The Pad Thai was very tasty without it tasting like a ton of MSG.  It even came with soup (chicken rice today) and a little crab rangoon.  

The damage including tip was right at $15 (Pad Thai plus $2 extra for tofu and $2 for a Diet Coke).  A little pricy for lunch, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Incredibly salty, entirely the wrong kind of noodles, the wrong kind of sauce, and worst of all, carrots and broccoli! This food is about as Thai as a hamburger."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this place had a steady retained customer until they showed their true colors... I absolutely loved their crab fried rice and greasy soup until one afternoon I ordered their soup with half cooked fish which was absolutely nauseating... I waited for my order over one hour when I order an hour before the food was prepared... The hostest has to be a complete idiot, because when I came to pick up my food she kept telling oh it'll be a few minutes after waiting an hour I left after paying for my food. I told this goof troop that I'll be back for my money and a word with the manager once I get off of work. So I called in one of my rant fits and the hostest said 'Ohhh your Sarena it's been sitting here since you paid' I mean really wtf... You took my money but kept playing the wait game. I was infuriated asked one of my co-workers to pick up the food... After all the waiting the sugar honey iced tea was horrid... Never again"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food, and prompt without making you feel rushed. Ate here for lunch, group of 5, when in town for a conference. There was a line out the door but a hostess quickly came outside to take names and clarify that the wait would only be about 10 min. Which it was. Ordered red curry chicken which came with a choice of soup or salad. Also a Thai iced tea. Everyone at the table was pleased and the server was also sensitive to our time constraints for the lunch hour."}
{"text":"Nicky's is a wonderful option in the North Side, located in a brownstone on Western Ave, just a couple blocks from Heinz Field. Parking on the street is metered, but usually easy to find (unless it's game day, of course). Free street parking is easy to find but might require a little bit of walking (but not much!). 

While the main dining area can get quite loud, the outside patio out back is like a little oasis -- charming, relaxing, and a great place to enjoy dinner. Try the Choo Chee Tofu. If I could eat it all of the time, I would probably get sick of it. But since I can't, I wish I could because it is amazing. Thai basil AND kaffir lime leaves? Sign me up! It's probably worth noting that the portions are pretty big -- too big, really, but worth taking home. 

The waitstaff varies pretty dramatically night to night, and sometimes they can get a bit spotty (and occasionally there's a bit of a language barrier, but nothing that can't be very easily overcome with a little patience). I've never had a really bad experience at this restaurant, though, and I go regularly since it's in my neighborhood.

Special note #1: if you go in to get take-out and have to wait, they go out of their way to give you a glass of water or tea, which I've always found charming and have been very appreciative of. 

Special note #2: the bathroom is kind of amazing. 

Special note #3: yum."}
{"text":"My family just ordered dinner from here and couldn't have been more disappointed. For starters, the order was completely wrong and they forgot an entire meal. The food we did eat ended up being insanely spicy even though we ordered half the max spice level. We ended up throwing away half our food. Seems like there wasn't a chef in the kitchen and will not order again. If you're looking for Thai, go to Noodle Head."}
{"text":"Easily the best thai food in pittsburgh.  Hell, it might be the best FOOD in the area.  I was lucky enough to live less than a block from nicky's on the north side for 3 years.  I would suggest a specific dish, but it's all good.  You can literally close your eyes and point to anything on the menu and be satisfied. Eating at nicky's will make you feel like burt reynolds or sumthin'"}
{"text":"Very authentic Thai. Great prices for downtown. Staff was attentive and friendly. Panang curry was ridiculous. Ask for a little spice added to it and you will be delighteddddd."}
{"text":"Nicky's is a tough act to follow for aspiring Thai restaurants. Good service, good food, beautiful decor, lovely outdoor seating in the summer... And, there really isn't a better place to eat in the immediate vicinity. This can make it tough to get a table on some weekdays at lunch, but in the summer it's not usually too long of a wait."}
{"text":"I could probably order takeout from here for lunch everyday! Their lunch portions are huge and if you ask for spicy-then spicy is what you get. I'm a fan of their samosas, spicy green beans with chicken and eggplant with tofu. It appears they are always packed during lunch and dinner. Reservations are a must for dinner. Oh and they are also byob, which is great. Although it is winter time and the outdoor patio is not open, I absolutely cannot wait until that warm spring day when they do open the patio again. I could sit out there for hours, enjoying delicious Thai food."}
{"text":"Solid in the taste category, but maybe I was expecting too much by basing my expectations on high reviews and awards. 

The Tom Kah soup was excellent. Some of the best I've had. The pork larb was new for me and quite tasty. The Phad Thai was flavorful, but too juicy. The crab fried rice was bland but plentiful. One of the people at our table ordered a red snapper dish that was quite spicy but pretty good. The fish was crispy on the outside, yet tender inside.

The dining room is small and very loud. My companions and I had to raise our voices above normal talking level just to hear each other. And a $5 per bottle corkage fee for a restaurant of this nature is, in my opinion, ridiculous. We paid more to drink our three 12 oz. bottles of beer than we did to buy them.

Overall, it wasn't a bad experience and we'll likely go back to try other menu options. We'll just make it when we don't have much to say, and don't want a beer with dinner."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I have had in Pittsburgh.  Actually one of top 5 restaurants I have been to in Pittsburgh.  Vegetables in the dishes were cooked perfectly as in they were still crispy and bursting with flavor.  I had the Spicy Basil Fish and the sauce was delicious.  Portions are also pretty large and quality of ingredients used is high.   I was furthermore impressed with the excellent service and nice ambiance.  My water glass was almost always full.  I have had a lot of Thai in Pittsburgh that is decent but this was the first Thai that was truly good.   Deserts are also amazing, homemade, and large size for the value.  Whenever I go to Thai or Indian, I always order an 8.  Usually the 8 is not spicy.  I respect this place for actually making an 8 spicy and not totally degrading the value of a true 1 to 10 scale.   (This however should be a warning that if you are not a fan of spice, order a lower number than you are accustomed to.)   Restaurant is also very accommodating to Vegetarians and Vegans.  If you want good Thai in Pittsburgh, this is the place."}
{"text":"Had their food 3 times now, tried different dishes, every time the food came out overly salty and the meat are way overcooked, chewy like jerky. Also I had to call multiple times before someone picks up, which seems consistent with some other reviews. This is a shame because I consider their other 2 locations are the best Thai food in Pittsburgh. I sincerely hope they improve on the food quality because this location is very convenient."}
{"text":"please please please do sit outside...really does feel like you're in thailand,the food was decent and you can bring your own booze,it's great for a date or even a friday night dinner with your gang...and it's reasonable too!loved it!"}
{"text":"Very good!
Yellow curry was good.
Long line.
Garlic fish is very good."}
{"text":"Absolutely five star food. So many options, even for the non adventurous. I love all the curries and the house salad is to die for. The decor is fun. Even the gold plates and silver wear help set the atmosphere. 

My only criticism is the service isn't the quickest.  Very friendly and helpful, but not somewhere id stop on my lunch break with more than one or two colleagues. Anything larger of a group seem to slow them to a crawl. Also, later at night service becomes slower as the night goes on. 

Still a place i'm very happy to return to and recommend it to any foodie."}
{"text":"Nicky's Thai Kitchen saved the day.

We arrived here on a snowy Saturday afternoon in bad moods. I was not happy about leaving this amazing city and flying home to a city I've grown to loathe, and our attempts to eat in the Strip District had been thwarted by crowds, traffic and a restaurant who refused to serve us. We walked into Nicky's and it was warm, it smelled great and the staff actually smiled at us. 

Honestly, they could have served us dog food at that point and I would have been satisfied. The fact that they actually served good food was a bonus. The lunch special, somewhere in the vicinity of $6.99, was a bowl of chicken and rice soup and an entree. I got Chicken Pad Thai, and it was delightful. It's not the best Pad Thai I've ever had, but it wasn't too sweet and it filled me up. With drinks, the two of us got out for less than $20.

Nicky's was the last meal I'd have in Pittsburgh, and after loads of sandwiches stacked with french fries, possibly the best. It'll always have a special place in that cold dark place that resides deep in my bosom."}
{"text":"Food wasn't great, service was so so but the most significant reason I wouldn't recommend this place was the noise was utterly deafening. I'm not talking loud, I'm talking ear splitting. If you have any desire to converse, you had better know sign language. Next!"}
{"text":"Nicky's has been a mixed bag for me. While I think their tom kha, papaya salad, crab rangoons, and fried tofu are excellent, I've also had some terrible dishes such as the seafood hotpot (wayyy overcooked and rubbery), the beef noodle soup (not very flavorful), the fried tofu in peanut sauce (too sweet), and even the garlic green beans (salty to the point of being inedible).

The back patio is beautiful and BYOB can either be a plus or minus. Service is always friendly. I don't think I would eat here often if it weren't so close to my house, but when they do a good dish, it is very tasty."}
{"text":"I love Thai food!! I usually don't stay at a Thai restaurant if they don't impress me with their basic rice dishes. This spot wasn't my favorite when it came down to just Thai fried rice. Then one day I tasted my friend dish and it was the BEST THING ON THE MENU. Exactly when I started to go there often but just for this particular dish I would hear other ppl come in & only order this dish too. THEY HAVE THE BEST PUMPKIN CURRY DISH! I LOVE SPICY SO I HAD FROM SCALE 1-10 A 7. IT WAS DELICIOUS!! And I LOVE THEIR COCONUT RICE TOO! Service was good & it's a cute spot"}
{"text":"I was impressed!!! The food was delicious.  I am from the DMV (DC).  This was one of the highlights on my visit to Pittsburg.  Will go again.  Thanks for the attentive service and great food."}
{"text":"In the process of moving here from So Cal / Orange County! I must say, Best Thai food in Pittsburgh, service outstanding, quality Top Notch! Will become a regular."}
{"text":"The deluxe spring rolls were good. However the spicy noodles with chicken were awful. No flavor, little chicken, and no vegetables. Frankly, quite disappointed based on the reviews. On top of that, they don't accept American Express. In the downtown business core with business travelers, that's inexcusable. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner.  Loved the sampler entrée.  Place was busy but the got us in ... Service was great too."}
{"text":"It's very pretty and well decorated, but very short staffed. My mom and I were nearby and decided to try it out. It was very busy, but we did go on a Saturday so that should be expected. We sat at our table for easily 15-20 minutes without being acknowledged by a waiter or waitress at all. We ended up leaving before we could order because it did not seem like we would be acknowledged by wait staff at all."}
{"text":"This is a bittersweet review:
The food is excellent, and I highly recommend the spicy noodles and the steamed dumplings. The service was good and the place was quaint and clean. However, be very careful here because I paid with a credit card that I had not publicly used in a very long time, and the very next day fraudulent charges were on the same card. Luckily the credit card company caught it and alerted me ASAP. I have to assume an employee at Nicky's was the culprit considering I have not pulled this card out of my wallet in 6 months. I could be wrong, but be wary."}
{"text":"Decided to try this thai restaurant in downtown Pittsburgh. Parking on a weekend (even paid parking)  is a real challenge. Food was fairly good, but the menu boards made of stiff, inflexible cardboard were near 14 -15 inch long and one could just foresee that in such crowded situations the tall slim glasses or wine bottle on the already laden table would risk being overturned and possibly cause embarrassment or even injury. 
When our party was being seated, (we had reservations for a graduation). asked the young shorter male waiter to wipe some water droplets from a chair. Unbelievably, he tried wiping with his bare hand. Keep in mind this is the same hand used to hold plates of food. When that didn't work he used his apron hem.  During the meal the other taller waiter spilled one of the tall glasses flush unto one of our guests (who could have seen this coming?) and while he attempted to clean it up, no offer to even comp a drink or small side order etc. was  made. (Our bill was almost $300 incl 18% automatic gratuity).
Otherwise the ambience was positive. 
Further training of the serving staff and possible re-thinking of the impractical menu boards etc. might be a good idea."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful and well seasoned. The staff was helpful and very quick.

My only down side was the vegetarian option my friend had. It takes a very high level of understanding of spices and flavors to balance heat with savory, and I don't think the kitchen staff is experienced enough YET with cooking with tofu to the same amazing level they are with meat dishes. 

Will definitely be eating here again when I visit!"}
{"text":"I really want to give Nicky's a better rating, because I've had some amazing Pad Thai here. Unfortunately, I've also had some so-so and not that great Pad Thai at Nicky's. I typically do take-out and get food in the evenings and I have to say the lack of consistency is disappointing. When their food is on, I would say it's some of the best Thai food in the city, but my recent orders have been off more than on. 

The appetizers I've tried (e.g., dumplings, spring and egg rolls, chicken satay) are small for the price, so I would skip them entirely. The dinner portions, however, are pretty large and I can usually make two meals out of one entree."}
{"text":"Being a big curry fan, this place is my paradise! All kinds of meat cooked with rich spices and delicious Thai-style curries making my mouth watery just thinking about it. Also love their ginger tea and dessert. I took away one star because they put too much potato in the curries and the potato was not well cooked at all."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I've been ignored in a restaurant based presumably on the color of my skin, thanks Nicky!
The frail hostess with the long ponytail had us wait at the concierge for 7minutes and only after I walked up to her and asked to be seated were my husband and I acknowledged.
Hey, they cannot know that I'm working on my graduate degree at Harvard and my husband and I are in town for an academic conference being held at the Westin.
I guess to them we look like potentially poor tippers, not a former restaurateur and current grad student and an academic.
Hey, I guess we got profiled, in their defense,we are the only chocolate chips seated for lunch ...Maybe that makes us....Invisable???
I never tip less than 30%, today it'll be 0%."}
{"text":"I had the Tofu Pad See Ew and liked it a lot, i was full-on vegetarian at the time and so few places in Pittsburgh make good and non-soggy tofu. It was big enough to have leftovers but I ate it all lol. 
I ordered a 4 out of 5 for spiciness and was expecting it to be much spicier than it turned out to be, not a big deal but a little disappointing. 
It also took a while to get our meal, almost half an hour, but the restaurant was totally full and there was a line so it made sense."}
{"text":"Decent option if I were really craving Thai.  Ordered heat level of 2-3 but it had no heat. Only truly bad part was the chicken in my pad thai. Probably the worst I've ever had--was SO tough and dry that I actually wasn't sure it was chicken. Assuming the chicken-cooker was having a bad day, I would probably give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Stopped by here the other day and tried the panang curry with chicken.  It was pretty good, but at $13.50 + tax (which is an increase from the menu posted on yelp) was not as good as some other places in town in terms of quantity to price ratio.  The spicy level I was offered ranged on a scale of 4-10 and I ordered 6, which was about right for me.  The decor was nice, and I liked that they had outdoor seating as well.  BYOB is always nice though has almost come to be expected at Thai places."}
{"text":"This is easily the best Asian food we have had in the North Hills. We have been there twice, once for lunch and once for dinner, both on Saturdays. I agree with other posters who have noted that the earlier reviews seem overly harsh. We had absolutely no issues with the service-- they did forget to bring extra rice we ordered, but we reminded them and they brought it right out. My wife and I love Asian food, and we will continue to come here as often as we can. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place has very good food with excellent service, Also the ability to bring your own bottle was a refreshing change from getting gauged on liquor at home. Noodles were particularly good and there are also lots of vegetarian options. Pineapple seafood fried rice was off the hook. If you have a large group make reservations as the place is not too big,"}
{"text":"Excellent delicious authentic Thai food that is totally worth the trip to Verona, which isn't actually that far away.

Skip the fresh spring rolls. They are  on the small side and not that interesting. However everything else was quite good. Service was attentive and it was a pretty busy room. They don't take reservations.
Ginger fish was delicious, as was the Eggplant and Tofu and the Beef Pad Phet. 

Other than the spring rolls, the only other negative is that the portion sizes are a bit on the smaller side which isn't as good for sharing. However the flavours are so intense, it quite makes up for it. 

Oh it's BYOB. They don't charge a corkage fee for the first bottle, but $3 for any additional bottles."}
{"text":"Superb, even as take-out. Best Thai in Pittsburgh. I ordered take-away Kao Soy noodles,  vegetable 4 U, and chicken satay-- all were amazing. I highly recommend Nicky's!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. I love Thai, and I want to try pad Thai for my first visit. Unluckily,  Nicky's pad Thai is too sweet for me. Less peanut flavor."}
{"text":"Things have much improved here I am glad to note.  The first time I went there I got the Chilli Shrimp special as a take out.  It was so horrible I had to throw it out and I am not a picky eater.  It was obviously on special because the shrimp was going bad.  It smelled like amonia and was mushy.  If I had not lived so far away I would have returned to get my money back!  Figured I would return now and see if anything changed because I love Thai.  I been there twice in the last month.  The Tom Ka soup is great!!!!  Very flavorful and full of vegetables!!  I have place some large take out orders to really try some of the dishes (still afraid to get shrimp though LOL!)  All good.  I will say they are very inconsistent with spice level.  One chef makes a 3 like a level 5 and the next time a 3 is like a 1 (reason for the 4 stars).  I will return to get my Thai fix."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed to find out that this company may have engaged in false advertising and misinformation. Nicky's \"Vegan Duck Curry,\" which they named \"VEGAN\" is not vegan at all. In fact, it's not even vegetarian - they use fish oil in the sauce. I ate this dish numerous time until I found out that the curry is not vegan. Further, even when I asked them to remove the fish oil, they wouldn't do it. Even worse, when I told them that it was really misleading to name a curry \"VEGAN Duck Curry\" and that they should probably not do this for liability issues (false advertising, reckless endangerment when it comes to people with allergies), they told me \"oh yeah, we have been told by a lot of people that this is misleading.\" They also told me that they weren't going to change the practice. I am very disappointed with how rude they were and that they refused to stop their practice of false advertising. I went from being a regular customer to never returning. Vegans and vegetarians beware! (Go to Siam's instead. It is around the corner and it has even better Thai food than Nicky's with no fish oil)."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great everything. The best Thai food in Pittsburgh. A gem. Don't forget there is also a location in Verona that is just as good."}
{"text":"Fantastic. The outdoor garden is great. Very reasonable. BYOB."}
{"text":"I made a yelp account specifically to make this review, and I'm sad to say this is something I've been thinking about since my last terrible meal at Nicky's a few months ago. The last time I was there, I had amazing service, but the worst tofu I've ever had in my entire life. My food came out ice cold and when I asked for them to reheat it, it was brought back out piping hot after about 30 seconds and disgustingly hard, having obviously just been microwaved. Tonight, I went for dinner with my boyfriend, on a crowded Tuesday night. After waiting about 20 minutes to hear from a server, we asked for our bottle of wine to be open (new TEN DOLLAR corkage fee). My boyfriend ordered the chili mango tofu and I asked for the tofu noodle soup.  I asked that the tofu be fried, because the menu specifically says \"fried tofu\" and last time I ordered it, it wasn't. The waitress immediately said no it couldn't be fried because they were \"busy\". I tried asking again nicely and she continued to tell me how they couldn't make the tofu fried because they were \"busy right now\" and didn't have time. After this ridiculous encounter, we continued to have terrible service throughout the entire meal as the waitress hurried us out of the restaurant. Not only did she give us our check immediately after we finished eating, but then she came back to check and see if we had put our card in about 4 times before we actually were ready.

I used to love this restaurant in the north side and was ecstatic when they opened a location on Penn because I live downtown. I have tried to give them the benefit of the doubt multiple times and to rationalize terrible experiences here. After tonight's meal, I would not recommend Nicky's to anyone, and will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"I love Nicky's and stop here frequently (great for an affordable takeout lunch option or an after work dinner with friends).  The atmosphere is great and the staff are welcoming and friendly.  I've truly never had anything bad to eat here.

Last night I met a friend for dinner and treated myself to a glass of their gewürztraminer (Chateau De Michelle - a favorite) which was a great deal (and a generous pour) for $5.  They do have a full bar at this location but you can still bring your own bottle of wine if you'd like.  Their corkage fee is $10.

At the recommendation of another friend I ordered their pineapple fried rice with chicken and kept the spiciness to a level 4.  It was wonderful!!  Next time (and there will be a next time for this dish) I'm going to bump it up to a 6 or 7.  

You can't go wrong with Nicky's if you're in the mood for delicious Thai downtown.  I would highly recommend it and it's great (and very convenient) if you're heading to a show at the Benedum or Heinz Hall!"}
{"text":"Don't think for a minute my granddaughter and I did not know that you did not want to serve us because we were black your sign  which you lied and said you were closed was not even turnt we saw it as we came in and went out and your door you knew it would have been closed and locked you didn't either. But you let us enter and stand for a minute and then say we're closed in the language we almost didn't get then your Sidekick across from you nodded his head I'm going to report you so don't think for a moment we didn't realize it was because of our skin color that you did not want to serve us now maybe you have served blacks before but folks just have to know you did not want to serve these two blacks and my granddaughters feelings you truly did hurt and she is  also a chef she went to college for it she really wanted your food so thank you for keeping racism alive"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant atmosphere I've ever seen. Fountains and Buddhist statues decorate the patio. 

The steamed dumplings were tasty, but came the same time as the entrees. Our group of 5 shared 2 pad Thai, pork red curry, pork green curry, and a tofu basil. All we're spiced well according to the 1 to 10 heat scale. Fresh ingredients in all. I have tried numerous versions of green curries and Nicky's is one the top 2. Red curry all right. Pad Thai delivered a sweet taste not typically found but worked well. No grease in this pad Thai, a refreshing take. A delicate flavorful sauce with the Thai basil that made the whole dish. 

Very affordable food and attentive service

Easily 5 stars. Drop by."}
{"text":"I usually don't complain and am easy going but what happened to me at this place was absolutely unacceptable! I had a reservation for 3 at 7:15. We weren't seated until about. 7:30 and placed out order around 7:45.  At 8:40 we asked our waitress where our food was and she said she'd check. Came back a couple minutes later saying it would be just a few more minutes. Come 9 we still had no food.  In the meantime I watched 2 other couples be seated AND get their food while we had nothing.  The manager was a spineless guy who was so uncomfortable with confrontation I almost felt bad for him.  Anyhow at 9 we got up and left. They offered us our meal for free but considering it still wasn't ready we just left.  

I almost feel bad writing a negative review because the food may have actually been good, however, we never got any but the horrid service forced my hand. 

We called up Pusadee's and they were sympathetic and were more than willing to take us even at 9:20 (considering we had to drive there from where we were at)."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place for its quaint style and the interesting dishes. The spice level is...shall I say, true to the number...and delicious. It is BYOB. The corking fee is $5.00. The service is great. You will always have someone checking on you. Great little nook in the North Side. Will return again soon."}
{"text":"I've been to several Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh but Nicky Thai is the restaurant with the most options! Unique Thai cuisine at a reasonable price! The décor at the restaurant is unique as well."}
{"text":"I have never once had a bad experience at Nikki's, after 5 years of going there. The staff is super friendly, the location on western ave is great for parking or walking, and the food is exceedingly good. For anyone like me who enjoys spices food, they offer the normal 1-10 scale and if ask nicely they have a \"Thai Spicy\" option which may just knock you out. The pad Thai is the best in the city, and the curry is definitely a favorite."}
{"text":"I've been to Nicky's a few times now and each time I'm drawn back by the solid consistency of service, menu staples, and atmosphere. The tables are adorned with fresh flowers from the nearby flower shop. In the warmer months the outdoor seating is the best way to eat a Nicky's. As far as their scale of spice, an essential element of anyone who likes to indulge in the more sadistic culinary elements, Nicky's does stick to a 1-10 scale. However, ask your server for \"Thai spicy\" and the scale gets delightfully more brutal to the palate.  

My only gripe about Nicky's would e the pad Thai. I'm a fan of soft cooked veggies when they're steeped in a curry. However, when I see a pad Thai that looks like a wet noodle bowl I am instantly turned off. With ingredients as fresh as they pull out for garnishes, I would have expected something crisp or even raw in the pad thai."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant on the North Side.  I only eat there maybe once a month, but they're consistent; I've never had a bad experience there.  It's really small, so if you're claustrophobic, this is not the spot for you.  Whenever it's not freezing in Pittsburgh, though, you can eat in the garden, which is lovely - my friend had her engagement party there and it was awesome :)  The staff is always professional, and even when they're super busy they'll answer the phone - I've never waited longer than 20 minutes for take-out.  I love the crab-fried rice :)"}
{"text":"Just as disappointing the second time around. Ate in this time. Server was mean and the waitstaff never said \"thank you\" once. Food was bland, with flavors not up to par. Will be sticking to Thai Gourmet in Bloomfield!"}
{"text":"Love Nicky's! The outside has got to be the most beautiful outdoor dining area in pittsburgh- felt very similar to when I was in Thailand a few years ago. The dishes don't dissapoint- the pumpkin curry is especially delectable. Portions are huge and prices are reasonable. Truly a Thai oasis in the north side!"}
{"text":"The best yellow curry beef on the planet! We also ordered eggrolls Which were crispy and fresh. Its BYOB for a 5$ corkage fee. The patio is very quaint. We highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Awesome food great portions. Clean. Great service. Best Thai food in Pittsburgh. Have to try this place"}
{"text":"Excellent and Superior service with a table of 8. The food was piping hot, served quickly and was delicious. Cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Nicky's is now my go to spot for lunch time Thai!
5 Senses Review:

Sight: 7- Beautiful Thai decor, I love the Buddhas.
Sound: 8- a high number here is not good. It is difficult to hear and be heard.
Smell: 8- deliciouness everywhere. 
Touch: 5- except for some items you are using your utensils. Although the forks, knives etc. are a cool bamboo inspired shape.
Taste: Good range of spices (common of thai places) a 1-10 scale. and the tea was great.

I have been here twice now and have liked it more the second time. I wrote a tip before to make sure you get there early if this is for lunch. The place fills up FAST and they do not take reservations at lunch. The combo of it being crowded and no reservations almost made me go to a 3-star, but the food is just to good. Couple that with fast and polite service I chose to keep the 4th star. If you are in downtown and having lunch with your boss, colleagues or wife, the fast service is nice. Time is of the essense after all in coroprate America. I ordered the beef basil at a 6 level of spicy. I do wish thai places had a standard here in regards to spice because F me I was sweating!!! Yet it was still great. If you like pad thai, you cannot go wrong here. However, there are other great items. Be brave, you will not be disappointed.  

Even though the food was great, be midful of the crowd. If you are with a group be sure to leave enough time to wait (unless you get there early).

One thing I have trouble with are the use of tv's. For whatever reason I don't like them in places meant for people to be engaged with one another. Leave that for the bars where no one cares to talk.

Over all, nice people and great food and affordable. Another great part."}
{"text":"Caught dinner with a friend before the show. I would rate the food a 4 out of 5. I had the Pad Thai which was huge, and tasty. My friend had a curry bowl that was wonderful. Although I wish the bar would catch up to the kitchen, the prices were really reasonable. Overall, I would not hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in the Chef's special dish- seafood and scallops.  The lobster portion was a teaspoon full of garnish-like flakes...mostly potatoes.
It was also served in one of those pretentious oversized plate-bowls.
The place has really gone downhill since they expanded downtown.  Not worth the $23."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and service.  Best crab rangoons I've ever had!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the outside dining is well set and. Very nice for a cute date or relaxing mealtime with friends and family!"}
{"text":"The best cashew chicken in Pittsburgh in my opinion. Great service. Have been here numerous times and have never had a bad experience. In the summer the back outside patio is beautiful and romantic. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I'm a lover of Thai food but, sadly, great Thai food is hard to come by in most cities in the US (as far as I know, at least). I'd been hearing about Nicky's Thai for some time but never managed to make the trek to the North Side for it. So much easier to settle for mediocre (on a good day) Thai from somewhere closer to home in Squirrel Hill. We tried the new-ish downtown location of Nicky's Thai last night and it was by far the best Thai food I have had in a very, very, very long time. Quite possibly the best I've had outside of Thailand or cities with decent-sized Thai populations and some great Thai restaurants (e.g., Sydney).

We of course ordered far too much food and left feeling happy and full. The portions are pretty big. The problem is that they are so tasty that you do feel compelled to over indulge. But that's okay when it is so delicious, I suppose.

Nicky's Thai is a great little place downtown and is worth checking out. Delicious!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting from Hawaii and his brother took us here. I got the spicy green beans with chicken and my husband got the sweet and sour with chicken. It was amazing and one of the best thai places I've ever eaten at and this coming from someone that lives in Hawaii and we have a lot of Asian cuisine places like this. Even my husband liked his food and he doesn't really eat thai. The next time we come out here to visit, I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The one on western avenue stopped giving customers the option to go above 10. I use to order 20 but it's no longer offered. Now it's tailored towards people who don't eat spicy food. 10 was mild at best not \"Thai hot\". Not going here anymore. I think the one on penn ave still makes it hot or at least that's what someone said. Noodle head now makes their food hotter, same quality and half the cost."}
{"text":"Good Thai food.  How would I know?  I wouldn't, but I liked it.  Also, when I asked for Thai spicy as opposed to white boy spicy, I feel like this is the only place that actually honored my request so far.  It was good."}
{"text":"I've spent tons of time at authentic Thai resturants in Chicago and San Francisco I have to say this place is AMAZING. Nothing like it in Pittsburgh. Hands down the best Thai. The Pad See Eww, yes please!"}
{"text":"I've live in Chicago for quite some time. And I'd like to think I've developed a nook for good thai food (considering there is one on every corner.) I must say of the best I've tried in Chicago this one is just as good. It was the best surprise I found moving back. The wait staff is nice the food is excellent. The attention to detail will not be missed. Wish there were more places like this in the area. Check it out."}
{"text":"I honestly don't believe any of the few bad reviews. From my experience, this is the best restaurant Downtown and I eat here for lunch at least once a week. I invite my family and friends here for dinner. The Garprow Lad Kao Chicken is my favorite. Along with the cashew tofu or chicken dish!"}
{"text":"Thai food for white people.

We ordered a 10/10 spice level and my three year old daughter ate it without difficulty (as did my in-laws who can barely handle the spice level of salt). So, we asked for some fresh Thai peppers and they brought sauces instead (red flag). When we again requested peppers they wanted to charge us an extra $1 for the spice in the food they failed to deliver in the first place.

Had the flavor profiles been more interesting I may have been much more forgiving, but it tasted like average, over-sauced Pittsburgh Thai.

The coup de grace was actually that we were charged an unearned 18% gratuity because we were a large group.

As a note, the corking fee for beer is $0.50/bottle, not $5 as some had previously mentioned."}
{"text":"I don't really get why so many people love this place. I've tried a couple of times to give it a fair chance to impress me, but every time it simply failed.
When I was seated inside the restaurant, it was so loud I couldn't hear our private conversation at all. We had to yell at each other to be able to talk. On the other hand, I actually liked when I was seated in the outdoor garden. The ambiance is quite nice, and the decor is cute. However in this restaurant, the space is so tight I could hear everyone else's conversation as if I was sitting with all of them. It was not a very nice setting for a date.
The food was just okay. Pad Thai was probably the only dish I liked enough to have it again next time, if I ever go back. Another curry noodle dish was way too salty, I packed the whole thing and had to eat it with white rice. 
On top of all this, the service was slow every time I went to this restaurant. Mediocre food, noisy environment, pricey dishes, and slow service - why would I every go back there? There are so many other thai places in Pittsburgh that are better than this one."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now, once take-out and once dine-in and I have enjoyed the food both times.  I would recommend getting takeout however if possible because the restaurant is pretty crowded on the inside due to a lot of close packed tables and the crowd of people that always seems to be standing at the front of the restaurant which spills over into the seating area.  This might also be a winter only problem, but when I was eating here recently with a few other people, every time someone opened the door a huge blast of cold air rushed into the restaurant which made it pretty uncomfortable to eat.

All the food that I've had from here though has been great and pretty fairly priced especially considering the huge portion sizes you get.  When we ate in we got the fried egg rolls, which were deliciously flaky and perfectly cooked.  I like spicy food, but Thai places don't mess around with their heat so you should definitely pick a milder spice level if you don't want to scorch your taste buds."}
{"text":"Honestly hands down the best Thai food in Pittsburgh. Great atmosphere, combined with an excellent staff and incredible food makes it a must visit restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I eat here minimum 2-3 times per-week. It can get very busy during the week around lunch.  Mondays are always good or get there early and enjoy the taste of Thailand. Last but not least GO HOT OR GO HOME lol."}
{"text":"Loveeeee their food! They do an excellent job with their quickness of service & they have a great variety on their menu. Food is authentic and fresh."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in Pittsburgh. Wonderful atmosphere and good wait staff!

I personally enjoy that the spice scale runs on the spicier side. A 7-10 will likely have your eyes tearing up. Also a big plus for them is that they don't skimp out on the meat quantity. Overall a great place that i hope maintains the quality.

Make sure to make a reservation as there is usually a line out the door!"}
{"text":"When I find myself on the Northside I really like dining in here, the service is nice and I love the setting: the decor and lighting are lovely and cozy.  It might actually be my favorite Pad Thai in the burgh, but curries are my jam and I can't say it's my fave, but they do nail it.  Their vegetables are vibrant and colorful and cooked to perfection and I like a little heat and they definitely deliver.  I honestly would give them five stars except I've been at two separate parties where they were the main food ordered for take out and it was completely inedible because of the spice.   It's possible my hosts in both cases asked for too high a number, but I feel like if the kitchen knew this was for a lot of people, they shouldn't dumped quite so many red pepper flakes in the mix.  I think it's something they could easily offer to pack on the side and let people add at their own speed."}
{"text":"Good Thai food. Server & cooks aim to please. If you need a Thai food fix, I would recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"The host was so rude, but I didn't think that my lunch would be terrible. I ordered the overpriced lunch panang and it came with the worst chicken noodle soup. The soup was something you would find at a Russian orphanage. Things they scrapped by and call it soup. The panang was the most bland curry dish I've ever had."}
{"text":"My cousins and I went today. All of our meals were excellent. Soup, salad, crab rangoon and our respected entrees."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Nicky's Thai kitchen! The atmosphere and decor is great! Especially, the outside area...it's decorated so nice and it feels like you are enjoying a meal in Thailand! All of the staff are friendly and the service is very good! I love all the different options of food you can get here, but if you aren't feeling like trying something different, they do offer more common food items. My favorite thing to order there is the chicken with garlic sauce. It is so tasty! Easily a favorite! Definitely a great spot to try when in the North Side!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner before a Pirates game and made a great choice!  Started with the spring rolls- they were fresh and were accompanied by a terrific sauce.  As with the entree, the portion size was large which made the spring rolls perfect for sharing.  I appreciate restaurants that are generous on the appetizer portions as they are commonly shared.
For the entree I got the spicy chicken noodles- ordered an 8 on the 1-10 scale and woo-wee did that hit the spot!  Had excellent flavor and spices.  My wife ordered the pad thai mild and she enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"A perfectly decent Thai meal, but was expecting a lot more based on the reputation and reviews.  Spring rolls were good, albeit a bit too packed with basil.  Flavor balance was way off.   The dishes tended to be a bit too sweet with little subtlety in the flavors, even when ordered with a medium to hot level of spiciness.    Pumpkin Curry was a disappointment - hard chicken, bland squash.    Outdoor seating is great, indoors is pretty packed, but overall a fun place to go."}
{"text":"Had the exact opposite experience from those with bad service, etc.  we went last night and had great service and food!  We had pork buns that came out first, a delicious salad that came out shortly after the buns and then our entrees arrived as we finished the salad.  We had 2 of the specials and another dish from the regular menu....everything was very well prepared and delicious.  A few times while we were eating, a young woman came around to ask how everything was...it was a little odd in that she didn't seem very interested in what our reaction was but it was a nice attempt to make sure everything was OK.  Our waiter was attentive and helpful.  We had ordered takeout from Nicky's shortly after they opened and it was somewhat of a disaster. It took quite a long time for the food to come out and although it was very good, the wait was a little too much so we have waited a while to try it again.  This time it couldn't have been much better...we will return!"}
{"text":"Used to be our go-to thai spot in downtown. I went a lot last year but tried it twice recently and their quality  has drastically gone down :( the first of the two times, I thought I just caught them on a bad night but the second time confirmed it for me. Their food is now tasteless without siracha, extremely greasy and the noodles are dry and chewy. Both times i forced down the food and eventually had to throw it away because it was inedible :( even the white rice was dry and seemed old. Don't plan to go back anymore."}
{"text":"So I saw mixed reviews but still decided to try. We had samosas, Tom yum soup, and mango curry. All meals were delicious. I especially enjoyed the curry: well seasoned and full of flavor. I saw some reviews about bad service. However the service was great and we came during a convention. The hostess was pleasant, checked in with us, and the food arrived in a timely manner (and the place was full). We had a good time."}
{"text":"I visit Nicky's during weekday lunch. NTK gets insanely busy, and you've got to get here before 11:30am if you don't want to wait. They do turn the tables quickly, so for a small party, the wait shouldn't be too long.

The food is absolutely delicious. I admit that I almost always order the pedestrian Chicken Pad Thai, but it's so great that I can't break the habit! Great flavors, crushed peanuts, easy to eat cut noodles, and a very generous portion for lunch.

I order a heat-level of 6, which is on a scale of 3-10. I like spicy food, but not so much that I'm sweating when I'm eating it. Sree's Indian food, located a few blocks away, would probably be a 7 on this scale. I like the heat to linger, but not so much that my lips are burning!

The Chicken Pad Thai (like other dishes) are served with either soup or a small salad.

You get this delicious meal for $9.09 as of Aug 2016, including tax. Throw in a few bucks for a tip, and you really can't beat the value!

I love Nicky's and will be sure to come again soon."}
{"text":"Great food, ambience, service.
Con-  Charge extra for steamed tofu, brown rice add does not accept Amex"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are Thai food lovers! We both had an extreme craving for curry, and a friend of ours recommended Nicky's. Downtown Pittsburgh is about an hour an a half drive for us, but because our friend told us how good it was, we figured it would be well worth the drive and gas money....boy were we wrong!

We arrived at about 5 minutes to 3PM on a Friday. We didn't realize that during the week, they have limited hours. They close at 3, and re-open at 5 for the dinner crowd.
When we were approached at the host stand, the first person we spoke to told us to \"hold on\" while she checked to see if they were \"still open.\"
A second person came up to us and expressed that it was fine for us to come in and be seated for lunch. We both were very understanding that we had arrived very close to closing time, and said we would have no problem waiting until the kitchen re-opened at 5 and we would come back. The worker assured us that it was no problem.

Upon being shown to our table, I sat down to look at the menu, and my boyfriend went to use the restroom. As I was looking over the menu and waiting for him to return, a third, very rude, worker came up to me with a pitcher of water and said \"how many of you are there?\" I let her know there would be 2 of us for lunch. She very disgustedly responded with \"you need to order right now, the kitchen is closing!\" I told her that my boyfriend was in the restroom, and neither of us knew what we were going to order, but as soon as he returned, we would decide and let her know.

Once he joined me, we were almost instantly approached by a different worker, and once again we were practically forced to make a decision about what to order.
Our food was dropped off at our table, as well as the check at the same time.

While we were eating our meals, nearly every employee in the restaurant came out into the dining room with their own meals to eat. This wouldn't have bothered me, however, our empty water glasses were ignored while they ate their own lunches.

I couldn't enjoy my meal whatsoever, and actually ended up leaving over half of it there because I wasn't offered a to go container. After our check was paid, 3 completely new workers came up to our table at the same time clearing everything on our table, including the vase of flowers.They were doing everything possible to get us out of there!

This was a complete disappointment, and such horrific display of business practice. I will not be returning, and most certainly will not be recommending this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"As far as Thai food in Pittsburgh goes, I'd imagine this is one of the best spots to go. We hadn't been here in some time, but were lucky enough to sit outside on a gorgeous day. 

Their covered patio is absolutely gorgeous, and the fact that it's covered is even a bigger win. That being said, it can be rather loud - during our last visit there was a bachelorette party and a rather loud family sandwiched on both sides of us.

As far as food, I typically stick with the spicy noodles (aka Drunken Noodles as you'll find elsewhere), and they are consistently delicious. My wife switches it up on a regular basis between curry dishes, daily specials, or soup and absolutely loves it here."}
{"text":"This place was excellent. Some of the best Thai food that I have ever had. The service was good and our waitress was really nice. Also, a big plus as always is that it is BYOB and their is no corking fee. One thing that should be noted about this place is that it is actually called Pittsburgh Thai by Boris now. My only gripe and it is a very little gripe is that they asked how spicy I wanted my food from 1 to 10 and I requested a 10. I would say that what I got was more along the lines of a 7 or 8 even for American standards. However, the food was still delicious and I will be going back there again."}
{"text":"Very good Thai Cuisine, price point can be a little high as far as Thai places, especially over $20 for crab fried rice is a little much. That being said, I have never had a bad meal from there. They have 3 Pittsburgh locations, if you are in the 412 and want Thai, this place is a solid option"}
{"text":"Yummmm. Warm, wonderful Thai food in both temperature and spice. Beautifully presented. More authentic than most. Best dumplings around. Perfectly cooked rice. The food is five stars; I'd give five stars overall if the place weren't so crowded and swamped during lunch hour. That being said, it's just a testament to how popular they are. Please get on grubhub! :)"}
{"text":"Super super salty seafood curry and broccoli beef. I enjoy thai food and came here based on the good reviews. Unfortunately it was a really unpleasant experience. I ended up picking the seafood and veggies out of the sauce because it was so salty. I would not recommend this place nor come back myself.  However the servers were very friendly and prompt. Thus 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"We have been Nicky's Thai kitchen fan for years and have patronized the other locations. We were so excited when this location opened to so close to home.. to our surprise we have been here three times in the last month and had bad experiences two of the three times. Once the curry was so watered down and was terrible and this last time we ordered the mussel appetizer which was 6 mussels and they were hard as a rock and over cooked. We sent them back and we're still charged $8.50. Hopefully the improve both the food and customer service or back to Red Orchid for us!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food are top notch! The food is beyond good, easily the best Thai in the city. I have gone to Nickys numerous times and try to get something new every time and am always overly pleased with the outcome. If you are in the area be sure to stop at Nickys! Check the hours before you go because they close down for a few hours/day."}
{"text":"Just a big fan of this place.  its small, cozy and the food taste fresh.  I have only been there for lunch and am always  looking forward to returning.   The steamed dumplings just melt in your mouth and i am always disappointed when i see the bottom of my pineapple curry bowl.   Wish they had a tasting menu."}
{"text":"Rude server

I dealt with Olivia (or at least that's the name I heard) yesterday when I had dinner with friends -- why do I actually have to pay for this bull**** service? I even gave a tip out of habit... wtf?

She was pushy throughout my time there and tried to force me to order an appetizer, even though I was not interested due to allergies. When I asked about possibly removing some ingredients due to an allergy, she gave me an attitude and said that it was part of the dish and not be removed.

Well, excuse me for asking and, god forbid, risk making her job harder. I cannot believe how rude people are these days: it's obvious that she would rather have a customer order more and get sick."}
{"text":"I like the  Phad Thai - Chicken #4 on the heat index was just perfect for me.   I like this dish best with cilantro.   Thanks Nicky's Thai Kitchen...will be back soon !"}
{"text":"The staff were friendly enough and the place looked nice. I had a green curry with chicken it came filled with vegetables and a good size serving BUT as other reviews have noted, peas have no place in a curry. They tasted weird and out of place. And the deal breaker for me was the curry itself. The chicken had a greyish blue tinge because the curry quite obviously had some sort of food dye in it. It was a bright minty green. If you make this using proper ingredients you don't need to do this. It had a thai-ish taste but clearly not well made. Disappointing and unappetising."}
{"text":"Very nice people in this restaurant. They are on top of everything and make you feel comfortable. 

Good food, I got the spring roles and the papaya salad. Great selection for dinner. I was very satisfied and full when I finished."}
{"text":"Delicious but sometimes hard to call in your order due to them being so busy! By far my fave Thai spot in Pgh"}
{"text":"The outside is really understated compared to the beauty within- its ambiance is warm and bustling during the times I've dropped in. Plus, that patio is gorgeous and rocking some serious instagram-worthy vibes.

Try the Kao Soy, a traditional Thai curry dish with egg noodles, it's why I give them 5 stars! 
Crab Rangoon and the pineapple dipping sauce also a fan favorite. And by fan...I mean my mom. 

She loves them. Go get some Rangoon for your mom."}
{"text":"Great little Thai restaurant. It's loud at lunch but we'll worth it. The currys are all fantastic. Service is quick. The place is clean. Prices good. Try it out! Oh, btw I just had the vegan duck curry. Absolutely delicious And to die for."}
{"text":"Let me be clear, the food is good here. That's said I WOULD NEVER RETURN. I advise you to at least skim through this as a discretionary tale should you visit. 
I went with a group of 6 and we were told over the phone the restaurant was BYOB. Between 6 of us we had brought two bottles of wine and some beer. While waiting about 15 minutes for glasses for wine I opened a few beers for the table with my OWN bottle opener and we had them from the bottle (no glasses ever came for beer). After the wine glasses finally arrived the ladies opened their first bottle and poured the wine. 
About 5 minutes later a server who spoke better English came by to say that each open wine bottle would be 10 dollars for a corking fee and each beer would be 2 dollars. 
The beer is ridiculous but the wine is a common practice... if you tell your patrons the fee exists beforehand. Either way we figured it was just 10 bucks so we would just let them know they should tell future guests about the fee in advance. 
At this point the server began to try and tell us that she already said this when she brought the glasses over ( she didn't bring the glasses a gentleman did and she came about 5 minutes later). We got the manager over to the table to let him know and she then proceeded to say she never said beer costed money and I should forget she said it...
At this point I realized she was willing to lie to our faces. We began to ignore her and speak only with the manager who said it would be 10 dollars flat for all drinks at the table including the remaining bottle of wine the girls had not opened yet. 
Fast forward 15 minutes the girls opened their second bottle. Instantly the snarky server walked by and said \"ha that's another 10\". 
You can imagine my frustration at this immaturity by this point. The manager returned and said he never said the fee was a flat rate for the table (which I clarified twice prior to him walking away), and said it was another 10 for the new bottle open.
Needless to say after some discussion, we did NOT pay another corking fee.
I truly have NEVER had such a negative experience at a restaurant, and all over 10 dollars. Shame on this restaurant for having terrible service. You have certainly lost 6 customers and hopefully at least others will beware if choosing to visit here. Just sad."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for Vegan cuisine. Vegan duck is a great choice. One of the servers always seems pretty grouchy, but the food is a winner."}
{"text":"i have never seen a staff that is so attentive to someone with fish allergies! they assured me that the option i chose would not have fish oil, oyster sauce, etc. in it, and made sure i was constantly aware that my food had not been contaminated. the meal was delicious!"}
{"text":"Food is good
Generally crowded
I walked into the place and the gal at the reception asked what I needed?"}
{"text":"Great outdoor space with funky Thai flare.  I was underwhelmed by the salads (particularly the lettuce), but otherwise delicious.  Super nice staff and mellow after 2PM"}
{"text":"Apps were good but that's all......mgmt didn't even apologize for the bad shrimp. ..pad Thai was unimpressive....server was nice."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites in Pittsburgh! I absolutely love my food every time I'm there and have always had great, quick and attentive service!"}
{"text":"Decor - All gold everythinggggggggg!!!!

Food - Sampler was about 50/50. I personally liked about half of the apps, including the dumplings and egg rolls. The people I was with enjoyed the other appetizers. Overall, everyone will find something they like. The entrees were your standard Thai food. I had the pad Thai (really risky, I know) but it was delicious.

Check out the picture I took, as it included a number of dishes that were ordered.

I would definitely go back and recommend for anyone who was in the mood for Thai."}
{"text":"They should add a tagline to Nicky's Thai Kitchen as Thai food heaven. If you are from out of town (like me), don't be fooled by the entrance of this restaurant. Once you go it, just ask for a table outside and you would be surprised to see the decor and the Thai cultural design of their outdoor seating. 

My wife and I visited the National Aviary which is less than a mile from this restaurant. We spent almost 5 hours at the aviary and wanted to eat lunch at around 3PM. So, I looked up nearby Thai restaurants on Yelp and Nicky's shows up first on the list. Quick look at the reviews and menu on my phone and we were on our way to check this place out for ourselves. Luckily found metered parking right in front of the restaurant. We entered not being very sure how much longer the restaurant will be open for lunch. There were hardly any people dining inside the restaurant. My wife asked to be seated outside even though it was around 90+ degrees heat. When we walked out through the wooden structures and plants and golden buddha statues and entered the outdoor seating area, it was 75% occupied and the Sun didn't even seem to bother any of us. 

The menu is extensive with all the traditional Thai dishes. We ordered a veg fried rice and a eggplant stir fry with tofu. Both the dishes came with a choice of soup or salad. Everything tasted real good and the staff service was very nice. We clicked a ton of pictures of the place as it was very beautifully done with waterfalls and statues and wooden wheels etc. When the bill finally arrived it was less than $20  for a heavy meal with excellent service and ambience."}
{"text":"Visited this location last Saturday after a three year break since my last visit at the North Shore location. This downtown location was BUSTLING, completely packed inside with customers squeezed in the narrow and small entrance. I didn't have a reservation which I wasn't aware they accepted so my girlfriend and I had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. Wasn't ideal as people were coming and going, some to pick up orders, others to fill their reservations. Point being it was hectic but this doesn't merit a 4-star rating because...

The food was AMAZING just like I remembered. I ordered the chicken Lhad Nah which is a garlic soup-like broth with veggies and flat noodles. Now call me a wimp because I only got a 3 spice level but the flavors were out of this world. Having cravings for it as we speak. Paired that with a Coconut Mojito which was very refreshing! 

Definitely stop in here or to the North Shore location. Awesome food. We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Great food, was in from out of town and this place hit the spot.  Ask for spicy - it is delicious.  It's that flavorful type of spicy taste that is somewhat hard to find."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe a new restaurant opened so close to my house that is actually worth eating at.  I've been there about a dozen times and loved my meal each time. I should first mention that I have a shellfish allergy. Yes it is a bummer but Nicky's Thai makes it very easy for me to eat there. The first time I went there the  waitress actually went over the menu with me and showed me what I could eat and what I couldn't eat. I've never had that happen before at a Thai restaurant. It turns out my favorite dish, chicken Phad Thai is safe for me to eat. I order it everytime because it's so delicicious and the serving size is so big I have leftovers for the next day. At lunch you get a soup or salad with your choice. Both are always tasty.  For dinner on the weekend there is a bit of a wait but it's worth it."}
{"text":"5  Stars for the food, our waiter was one star at best. But the food was so good, who cares if a few things were late?  Great selection and so flavorful. The Thai experts in our group rated it very highly as well, and they go to Bangkok, so I'll believe them."}
{"text":"Good service, and better-than-takeout Thai food.  Pad Thai was a little on the sweet side, but will come back to check out the curry dishes as I had food envy of others at the table."}
{"text":"Excited to go back here :)"}
{"text":"After spending a week in the city for a conference we were able to sample quite a few restaurants in downtown Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, we weren't blown away by any of them. On our final night we decided to try Nicky's. The decor was really well done, and the service was very good. Unfortunately, we had one big problem with the food. In a word... SALT. And not just a little too much salt - WAY TOO MUCH SALT. We could easily see the potential in the cooking here. The food itself seemed fresh, but the great Thai flavors (basil, coconut, etc) were completely overwhelmed by salt. We would have loved to give this place at least 4-stars, and we think the food alone would rate at least 4-stars, but all that salt just killed the experience. Hey Nicky, ditch the MSG. Your cooking can stand on its own without it!"}
{"text":"After a fun afternoon at The Mattress Factory Museum we headed over to Nicky's for dinner. It was a hot day but we could help but go out into their garden/outdoor eating area and check it out. So serene and beautifully decorated. 

So about the food. We started with the Happy Hour special: Crab Rangoons. They were SOOO GOOD! 

Next my husband and I each ordered the Chef's special: Phad Garprow Combo which was delicious!!! I ordered medium heat which was spicily perfect. It was stir fried ground chicken, bell peppers and basil in a sauce served on jasmine rice with 2 fried eggs on top. It also came with 2 egg rolls, 3 crab rangoons (which was awesome because I could have eaten just these by the platterful) and a bowl of Tom yum shrimp soup. Oh. My. Goodness! The food was divine. 

Our grown daughter ordered another one of the chef's specials: Hung Ley Curry with Grilled Scallops. Another winner! Curry was complex and rich in flavor with lots of nicely sized scallops. 

We couldn't stop saying, \"This is SO GOOD!\""}
{"text":"Definitely a favorite Thai restaurant of mine. It's always been a worthwhile trip from the East End to the North Side to get some Nicky's Thai. The Pad Thai is delicious.

My downtown experience was awesome. The food was timely and cooked great. I was in and out with a coworker in under an hour.   The decor is similar inside but it definitely doesn't have the patio/garden that the North Side has.

Side note - these one star reviewers are crazy. You cannot judge a restaurant on service in the first couple of weeks that it opens. Whether it's upscale dining or greasy spoon diner (or a Thai kitchen), there are always hiccups in service at the start. I hope they come and try again."}
{"text":"Awesome everything.if you like spicy food you will love it here. Authentic and a great wait staff. Sit in the patio if you can. Byob."}
{"text":"Great Place, BYOB, Small and quaint, very good atmosphere.  If you lke Thai you should go."}
{"text":"It's pretty basic Thai. Nothing crazy or unique. I think that PITTS is lacking in the Thai department. Got the pad-see-ew. Not bad. If you're hungry and wanting Thai you will be satisfied, just not impressed."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with coworkers. Got there right in time because they got slammed within the next 15 minutes.  

Didn't like that you had to walk the gauntlet to get out of the restaurant. The foyer was jampacked with waiting customers. 

Food service seemed a little slow for lunch but not overly so. 

Pad Thai beef level 6 - wonder what 10 tastes like? Asked for no egg, but surprise, surprise look at all that egg.  The surprise wonton was delicious.  The portion was huge!

Crispy egg rolls - super crispy, not a lot of filling. 

Napkin nazi - a table of five asked for extra napkins and he gave us two more."}
{"text":"I've been to the downtown Nicky's Thai and this one is just as good.  It's kinda in the middle of nowhere but the interior is very cozy.  They also have plenty of parking.  I got the Kao Soy with beef and it was satisfying.  The only issue with this place is that it seems like their spice level is off.  Half of our table got 5/5 spiciness and it just wasn't that spicy.  Other than that, everyone enjoyed their dishes.

Kao Soy with beef: 8.5/10"}
{"text":"If you don't answer your phone. You are pretty much saying you don't care about my business.  I excused it the first weekend, but two weeks in a row?  I dialed for over 40 minutes straight then called goodfellows. They answered right away!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Pittsburgh hands down.

I've been here several times with my girlfriend and I've had a different thing from the menu every time I went and have yet to be disappointed.  Their Pad See Ew is the best I've had anywhere and their various curry dishes are top notch.  Service is great and both the indoor and outdoor seating are very quaint and not overdone.  My only issue is that prices tend to be a bit higher than other places I've seen for Thai, but if you're in Pittsburgh and are looking for a good Thai place, don't pass up Nicky's."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town and the great yelp reviews brought us to this restaurant. Then it went downhill. Over an hour sitting at our table, ignored. Even after asking our waitress to check on our food, more waiting - like really really long waiting. It's been over an hour and no food. Leaving. This is a horrible experience."}
{"text":"We arrived for lunch at 11:30 on a Tuesday.  That was just as they were opening.  We were seated immediately.  It's a cute little place.   Some of the seating is quite tight and close together.

We both ordered chicken pad Thai.  It came with either soup or salad (lunch special).  We both chose salad.  A yummy salad with a bit of lettuce, cucumber, cherry tomato and carrot.

The pad Thai was honestly the best I have ever had !!!  You can get spiciness level between 1-5 with 5 being hottest.  I got 3 and it really wasn't hot at all.  The sauce had just the right amount of tanginess and sweetness.  The portion was generous for lunch and I ate every drop !!!

The place had totally filled up by the time we finished eating.  There were a few people waiting to be seated when we left."}
{"text":"I'll join the chorus of happy customers. I grew up in the suburbs of Pittsburgh and left in my early 30's and I haven't been back in over 20 years. I lived in California which is the land of excellent food. So I have a lot of experience with Thai restaurants and this one is top notch. The crab rangoon was gourmet quality as were the fresh rolls. The Tom Kha Gai was good, but I've had better... much better actually, but different folks have different ideas of what a coconut soup like this should be, so it was the chef's idea of good and homey no doubt. The curried fried rice was good albeit a tad bland. They chop their veggies up pretty roughly and it affects the flavoring. But all in all it was an excellent experience and I'll definitely go back. By the way, it was the first time in my entire life that I ate Thai food in Pittsburgh. Ha! It simply didn't exist when I lived here before. The wonders of this modern era."}
{"text":"They refused to seat us 10 minutes before their official opening time. Gosh it was cold on the stoop. I don't mind that a place is popular and gets full of people, but with tile floors and no sound dampening, I felt like I was having a psychotic episode with competing voices bombarding my brain. I couldn't hear the person I was with sitting across from me. The food.... nicer than some.. but mediocre flavors. The \"fresh\" flowers were not so fresh. The basil chicken had copious amounts of water at the bottom of the plate totally diluting the sauce and adding a tinny flavor to the dish. Won't go back. The server was very autonomous versus obsequious. I prefer obsequious but I could cut him a break for having too many tables."}
{"text":"Nicky's Thai was seriously the best Thai food i've ever had.  super pleasant surprise to come across this gem while in the burgh for 2 weeks for work. 

eating out for 2 weeks straight makes you pretty grumpy when it comes to food that isn't home cooked.  however, nicky's was wonderful.  from the outside it's kind of easy to miss.  it's snuggled between two stores so i walked right by it the first time.  once you walk in however it's like a whole new world.  beautiful wall decor, and the staff was super friendly.  they close i believe from like 2-5 and we walked in close to closing time, but they were wonderful.

we ordered the spring roll appetizer, pad thai with tofu and pad see ew with beef.  i know, how much more safe can you get!  but let me tell you, the taste was anything but safe.  it was rich and flavorful, and just bounced all over the place in my mouth.  i was super super satisfied and even contemplated going again the next day.

seriously, this place is a must!"}
{"text":"A great tucked away Thai restaurant on the North side. Perfect for lunch. Ask to sit outside on the back patio, very quaint!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOD!

Visited the Burg over the weekend and my obvious choice was Thai food. We were in town for the light up event so decided to drop into Nicky's for dinner. It was super crowded and there was a half hour wait, but believe it or not, every single person who was leaving said the wait was so worth it.

We had two vegan friends with us. The Server was kind enough to let us know of any fish /oyster sauce in the food and made sure we ordered right.

Appetiser:

Veggie spring rolls: Light and fresh and the peanut sauce was just magic!

Entree: 

Vegetable fried rice: This was hands down the best fried rice I've eaten in my life! It was just so good that despite being full to brim I couldn't stop eating it. I can still feel the burst of flavours in my mouth!

Tofu and eggplant entre: Sooo good. Deliciously spicy and such a perfect balance of flavours.

Vegetable Red curry: Again such great flavours. The coconut milk was light and perfect and the veggies were so fresh!

Let me remind you that all the above mentioned dishes are completely vegan. Loved this place! Totally made my night!

Also, did I mention, its SO reasonably priced! Bang in the middle of downtown Pittsburg with such great food and such competitive prices. This place is just the best!"}
{"text":"Just got back from dinner-we were really looking forward to eating at Nicky's due to the great reviews. We were disappointed. The wait staff were very friendly. The food however was just fair. Started off witht the vegetable dumplings-the dipping sauce was great but the dumplings were doughy and the center quite mushy. Then had the Tom Yom soup and ordered an 8 spicy but was more like a 15 and almost not edible. We order spicy between 8 and 9 everywhere we go so it's not like we want mild-we likd spicy. They merely sprinlked red hot pepper flakes onto  and into the soup. The soup looked good but was hard to eat. The tomatoes were not cooked and the pieces too large to fit in the mouth. Did not finish it.
The green curry tofu was very light and weak with little curry and little flavor. The broth was thin. Also ordered this one an 8 spicy but it was more like a 3. The fried basil rice was good but the rice was overcooked and mushy. The coconut ice cream was the best part of the meal. I don't think we will retrun."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with Nicky's. My husband and I live far away, otherwise we would probably go there at least once a week."}
{"text":"I am not an adventurous eater but heard this place was really good and wanted to give it a try when a group of friends suggested we go there for their outdoor seating. The patio out back is a garden oasis and I was impressed.  Glad we made reservations as every table was full and we had a large party of 12.  It is BYOB and a $5 corkage fee per bottle.  We had a few pregnant ladies in the group who brought sparkling juice and they charged $2 per bottle which I think was unnecessary. We started off with the spring rolls and samosas. All fresh and tasty with a good size portion of each. I really recommend the samosas.  The menu has many options and you can pick your spice level.  For my entrée I went the pineapple fried rice with veggies. Also have  your choice to add shrimp, pork, chicken or tofu. Not liking hot things I went with a zero spice level-yes go ahead and laugh but it was not too spicy at all. Great flavor combo of pineapple with nuts and raisins.  Others in my party ordered various types of curry dishes which are served in a really neat bowl. The service was excelled and we had a huge group."}
{"text":"Great cozy Thai restaurant on the North Shore. The Pad See Ew was flavored just right with a perfect amount of cilantro. The broccoli was just crisp enough and the chicken tender. 

Very cozy place. Tables seat 2 or 4. Very affordable with great service."}
{"text":"Pictures! I love this place haven't been in awhile, perfect time, lunch time, to add a couple of shots!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. overly expensive, so-so food. very busy. 
Visitors: please try other wonderful Thai venues that the city can offer. 

Waited for 30 minutes. It took several rounds of questions (only response was \"coming\") until the server realized the order did not go in. No compensation or apology was offered. It was difficult to communicate with the attendants in English."}
{"text":"Tasty, try the banana coconut toll"}
{"text":"Great food! They were super accommodating to my gluten allergies and everything we had was delicious! We also loved being able to bring our own wine!"}
{"text":"We went here based on all the yelp reviews but were utterly disappointed by the lack of service. No napkins and silverware till you ask for it. No fresh plates for main course after appetizers. No drink menu provided till asked for. Wife had a vegetarian dish that came with chicken. When we pointed this to the server, he simply said \" we normally do not put chicken in vegetarian dishes\" and left. There is no apology of any sorts, it was almost no one cared about it"}
{"text":"Delicious food that's nice and spicy. I LOVE that they do a scale of 1-10 for spice level. I got the spicy noodles at level 8 and my boyfriend got the green curry at a 7. Both were so delicious and came in large portions. The Thai iced green tea was delicious, too. The decor is really nice and I love that the food come in these golden goblet-like vessels - Makes you kind of feel like royalty. The staff is great. The servers are always close by to fill up the water, which is essential when the heat of the spicy food starts getting to you. Definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"I had one of the chef's specials which was excellent! The Red Curry Banana Combo. It had pork, chicken, beef, shrimp and banana in a wonderfully spicy-sweet sauce. I asked for 7 on a scale of 1-10 spiciness and would probably ask for a 5 the next time around. I cannot remember what my friend had but we did share the egg role appetizer and the fried banana-coconut with ice cream and both were yummy.  Our waiter was attentive and friendly and the restaurant is decorated beautifully.  My thai ice tea was also one of the best I have had. I would return again!"}
{"text":"My sister made a reservation for 7:00 pm. The service that was provided was great! You can see how well the group worked as a team. Water was constantly filled, dishes were bussed in a timely manner, and going above and beyond our server offered to take the group photo first.

Food for me personally could have been more tangy/tart/sour. I like a heavy hand with kaffir like leaf, lemongrass and galanga. 

We ordered the spicy noodles (tofu), duck curry, green curry (chicken), curry noodles (beef), mussels, Tom Kha (seafood). The family were happy with most of the meal except for the mussels. There were shells but a lot of missing mussels. I wouldn't recommend the mussels or the curry noodles."}
{"text":"I think my server was a bit shocked just now when he asked how my food was. My positive enthusiasm was pretty energetic. Was starving! Just came back from the bar and grille on 7th where I stopped out of desperation despite the accurate, negative yelp reviews. Tofu and broccoli perfectly flavoured. Texture of the tofu is perfect. This mushroom broth is divine. It's 5pm on a Sunday night and it's chill and not hectic. What sucks more than being starving and getting crap food? Not much. What's better than being starving and getting great food? Practically nothing. Thai food heroes! And reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"What a little gem of a restaurant! 

They have a lovely garden out back...it feels like a hidden gem on the north shore.

The Thai food was good, probably not the best in the city, but certainly competitive.  We had pumpkin curry, pad see-ew (sorry for the butchering of the language), and some appetizers.  I thought it was great - but my friends have made it clear I'm not a Thai food expert.

The service was good and very accommodating.

Between the great outdoor seating, the great food, and the great byob-ness of this place - it will be on regular rotation with me."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place forever, finally got around to it and wished it had been sooner.  I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken. Got a spice level of 7, I would have liked it to had been a little spicier. None the less, it Tasted amazing, definitely my favorite in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"My colleague and I stop there for a Saturday night dinner, and it was crowded (which it is usually a good signal). After waiting for 20 mins, we got a table. I tried the Salmon with mango. It was outstanding. I liked the fact that they have a huge variety of dishes, including both cheap and expensive ones. On top of that I got a local beer for$3.75, which is a decent price. Probably the worst part was the service: we asked the waiter about the beers, and he seemed to be pretty uninformed. But overall, good experience!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend recently for dinner and it was delicious! It is a kind of \"hole-in-the-wall\" place but the food is great!!!

I ordered Pad See Ew with beef and my friend ordered a vegetable curry. The noodles were perfectly cooked and not greasy at all. The veggies in my meal tasted fresh and I felt like I was eating at a place back in the SF Bay Area!!"}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the best Thai in Pittsburgh.   I've tried all Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh and this is the best and the most consistent."}
{"text":"Nicky's Thai kitchen is the best Thai restaurant I've ever been so far. I was there last Saturday afternoon for lunch, the food, service and restaurant itself is absolutely worth to give a try. Trust me if you want Thai food this is a right place for you. I like their decoration it is in side an old apartment building. Their main dining room is on first floor and the outdoor seating area is in the garden, which is perfect when the weather is nice out. But it was a raining day when I was there. I had Thai yellow curry chicken for my entree, spicy and delicious. They have other location in Peen ave I hear so much about this place and they really did a good job."}
{"text":"Haven't been back to Nicky's in a couple years, but was really in the mood for some Noodles and some spice. Of course I went with the Spicy Noodles! I only went Mild as I do remember going with a Medium last time and almost died from the heat, but even the Mild has a great kick. My lunch came with a small side soup which was good. I would recommend this place for someone looking to purposely give themselves a runny nose and a little heat burn. Very good!"}
{"text":"Great mixed drink (Mango Sangria), food was good! They didn't mix the spice well in one of my co-workers food so he ended up swallowing the last few bites in hell haha. I would come here again!"}
{"text":"Tom ka soup is amazing."}
{"text":"I ate at Niky's last evening.  Like a dumb bunny I never thought to make reservations and the place was packed.  They found seating for us and a late arrival guest with in 10 minutes.  What can I say, the food came out quick and it was delicious!  My first guest had never eaten there before and he ordered the duck.  He raved about it!  My TY Soup and the S&S Chicken was excellent!  My late arrival guest had the Chicken Mango Salad.  He was scraping the plate!"}
{"text":"First off I'll start with YOU HAVE to taste the pad Thai shrimp I get it just about everyday I work  I get it with a salad it's ALWAYS GREAT never a disappointment! The service is usually great besides today that's why I gave them 4 stars . Today I came in on my lunch break whomever answered the phone put me on hold it took me about 15-20 mins to get there. When I walked in the door (still on hold ) the hostess still hadn't picked up the phone  terrible ! Other than that I honestly love this place great food friendly people and a great atmosphere !"}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed when I go to Nicky's for lunch. We arrive promptly at 11:40 because the place gets packed super quick and its small-ish inside. 

I ordered the Thai Style Fried Rice with chicken. I got a Thai 6 for the spice level. I like spicy food and have gotten a 9 there before. The rice was a generous portion. I ate a little over half and took the rest to go. I really enjoyed the large chunks of green onion and the slices of chicken. The salad my meal came with was also delicious. It had the perfect amount of dressing and the mango was fresh. 

I didn't get an appetizer this time, but when I do, I go with the crab Rangoon. It's amazing! One comes with your meal, but who can eat only one!? 

This restaurant is also great for take out. If you're running late to lunch or even if you want grab something after you leave a happy hour downtown, it's perfect. I ordered it once and it was ready in less than 30 minutes. 

Overall, Nicky's has the best Thai in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Nicky's offers delicious food and a great atmosphere. The outdoor patio in the back is a very romantic spot, with lots of plants and you'll definitely feel like you're on vacation-- anywhere except the Burgh. Very Cool vibe. I'd highly recommend it for a date night or birthday celebration."}
{"text":"Ugh terrible service but food was awesome! Our waiter seemed to be in \"the weeds\" the entire night. We sat on the patio, food took about an hour which was OK because we were on a date but definitely was annoying; we will try it again and hope we just had a bad waiter but the entire service staff seem like it complete state of chaos!"}
{"text":"Great thai place. Good food, expansive menu."}
{"text":"On a recent trip back to the burgh in June,  we had already had Thai at our usual hangout and decided to go out for Thai a second time.  Being that NTK had made the top 25 restaurants in the burgh, i had to try it. So we made a rez and headed over.

Let's start by saying it is in an interesting neighborhood.  They are rehabbing lots of houses so there is some other activity on the street.  But it is a teenie tiny little house converted to a restaurant.

When you enter, you will look at those front steps and think \"it's not too late to turn around\" - but ignore the cracked steps and keep going.

Then you enter the house and walk down a long hallway when you think \"i should have turned around at the steps\" but keep walking.

When they seat you, you immediately realize that you are in a tiny little dining room and it is rather cozy.

And then - the menu comes.  Wow. Just wow.  Yeah, they have pad thai. and they have curry. and they have rad na noodles. and then they have lots of other choices - vegetarian, thai-hesitant (for those who don't like thai or are fearful of thai), and just some really really cool dishes.

So here goes the rundown of what was ordered.

The appetizer dog choice was the fresh spring rolls. So how do you differentiate yourself from the competition?  Slice them into manageable chunks so that they can be shared easily and dipped into that Yummy  dipping sauce.

I start with me as I can't rave enough about what I had.  Phar Luck Chicken.  it was a plate of steamed veggies (gr beans, snow peas, broccoli) covered with rice noodles, chicken breasts that were lightly spiced, then a peanut sauce on top.  I ordered a level 5 not knowing how it would be as one restaurant's 5 is another one's 3or 7.  Veggies were nicely steamed and crisp.  The chicken was mildly spiced atop a bed of noodles. And finished with a medium spiced peanut sauce. Just enough to taste but not over soaked.  And the surprise?  Two shrimps and some lump crabmeat.

Ok chef - one comment here. I loved the seafood but I know not everyone can eat that so including something that can trigger an allergic reaction without disclosing it can lead to disaster. And no customer would ever assume to ask about shrimp in a chicken dish.  Maybe add it to the description or have waitstaff mention it when it is ordered?

DH had green curry with chicken.  Lots of veggies, nicely spiced but nothing out of the ordinary.  It was good but maybe not as strong of a curry taste as he was used to.  But it held its own with the other Thai restaurants.

DSS had crab pineapple fried rice.  Ok. Seriously. How could you not love that combo. It took self-restraint on my part to not just grab that plate from him. Now THAT was an unusual combo I have never seen elsewhere and according to DSS, it was great (first sign of a good dish?  No offers to share :)

Our server was excellent.  Never was a water glass empty.  plates were removed promptly. We were never rushed as we lingered in conversation.  

So this is now added to my \"places to visit when back in the burgh\" list.


7/16. Update.
I decided while back in the burgh again on business to revisit NTK.  I ordered takeout to nibble back at the hotel.  A few comments. 
1.  The Phar Luck was as good as I remembered.  Yum again
2.  I passed on an appetizer so I could Try their sticky rice with custard.  Imagine my surprise when I opened it and discovered black sticky rice....oh my....wow.  Topped with a square of creamy smooth custard topped with coconut.  Again the little details that make NTK just stand out from the pack.
3.  I was surprised to be charged a surcharge for a takeout order.  Seriously? Each item was marked up for the privilege of saving them the salary they pay their waitstaff when I took the food out. No, it is not a big deal (a little over 10% or so). Again, disclosure would have been nice. Or no surcharge at all.
4.  Speaking of takeout, chef, how about using some of that surcharge to pay for decent plastic ware? I don't do chopsticks and found that it was impossible to spear the steamed veggies with those dollar store forks. Since I was in a hotel without a kitchen, that was the only fork I had and when it snapped in the broccoli....well....let's just say it wasn't pretty.  So maybe think about some decent flatware, so I don't need to pack my own next time I get takeout?"}
{"text":"Food is so so. Patio is great. Make sure to call for reservation to sit outside. Patio is covered from rain. I ordered diet coke. It came so hot but with glass of ice."}
{"text":"Love LOVE this place. Every single item on the menu I've ordered is delicious, from lunch to dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food, generous portions, amazing staff and the outdoor dining is delightful.  Can't wait to return on our next trip through Pittsburgh.  Lovely neighbor for a stroll after dinner on the block behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"Good service, quality Thai, your typical Thai plus some special items. Good dessert place right next-door if you're into stuff like that."}
{"text":"Still my favorite Thai place in the burgh thus far. It's small and cute. Reservations are suggested, especially for dinner, but is always crowded. Their back patio is extremely nice, great atmosphere with Thai decor and gardens. Everything is always great and I have yet to find a better yellow curry, anywhere. Their tofu is always spot on too. In addition to everything being so delish and consistant, their prices are excellent. Lunch is especially cheap and comes with soup or salad. 
They are BYOB
Pros: 
Summer, great outdoor seating.
cheap
excellent quality food
Cons:
Always busy and quite loud inside"}
{"text":"Food was incredible but the service was even better.. Highly recommend this spot. The price was reasonable especially for being downtown."}
{"text":"We ordered the appetizers sampler, high recommend! I ordered the ginger bourbon hot tea, it was delicious and one is more than enough. For my meal I got the spicy noodles and my husband got the crab fried rice. Mine was delicious and perfect at a spicy level 2. My husband did not care for his dish too much, not the fried rice he was thinking it would be and spicy level 3 was not hot enough for him. The service was excellent and the decor is beautiful. We will definitely be back to sit on the porch area this summer!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place, its honestly probably in my top 3 for food places in Pittsburgh. I first discovered this place during my internship last summer and I've been coming ever since. From the atmosphere to the portions do the variety and quality in their menu, there's nothing negative that I can think of when it comes to describing this food joint. I usually am one to order the Gaprow Lad Kao or the Pad Thai but there's an assortment of other items on the menu that are sure to put your taste buds in a euphoric whirl. Their range spice levels (ranging from 1-5) allow for even the most sensitive of pallets to enjoy their food and their lunch and dinner specials are enough to fill up the largest of tummies. The two things I would make sure you make note of though if you plan on dining here is that 1.) They do not do reservations for lunch at this location, only dinner and 2.) This place gets packed relatively quickly, so if you plan on sitting down and enjoying your meal in, definitely try to come in earlier rather than later, especially for their lunch hour."}
{"text":"Really really really really good. Maybe a little more expensive than other thai equivalents, but the veggies in my pad see ew (sp?) were fresh and the sauce was amazing! My only qualm is that my buddy ordered drunken noodle, which they didn't have, so they suggested their stand in: spicy noodle. It was just noodles and basil. Oh well. The pad thai was also amazing."}
{"text":"I must preface this review by saying that this is the only time I visited Nicky's Thai Kitchen (or Pittsburgh for that matter), so it could just be a fluke - maybe the chef had a bad day - but this is the second worst Thai food I've had anywhere in the world...  The worst was in Aruba. 

I'm a fan of Thai food as you can tell - craving it even when on vacation in Aruba - so I have a certain expectation when I saw the 4-star ratings for this restaurant.  But wasn't I disappointed!  We ordered Drunken Noodles and Panang Curry, both with beef, and spicy.  Typical Thai dish right? Wrong.  What we got are two tasteless dishes.  The Drunken Noodles dish is not just bland and way too mild, but both the veggie and meat tasted stale.  The Panang Curry was equally unimpressive. The color of the broth may be right, but there is only a hint of curry taste in it.  The meat was chewy to the point that I gave up on most of it.  As hungry as we were after a long day of driving, you would think that we would find anything tasty.  But unfortunately for us, we threw away at least half of it and had to look for a second dinner.

I don't know, maybe the chef just isn't very good at the common dishes.  Not sure if I'll have a chance to give it another try, though."}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere and always busy! I try something new each time and it's always amazing. The red curry, see yew, and sweet and sour chicken are great! I will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"With so many restaurants on penn ave. I picked this place since I wanted something spicy and they didn't dissapoint. Started out with the crispy Eggrolls  which came out nice and hot with a nice dipping sauce. I'm used to vietnamese style which are bigger and fuller but these were nice little bite sized Eggrolls (qty 5).  I tried the pineapple curry with chicken (8 heat) for my main meal. It came out pipping hot with the warm rice on the side. It was amazing. I wish I had a bigger stomach. The blend of the curry spices and peppers complimented the sweet pineapple chunks.  Topped it all off with a sake bomb which was light n refreshing. Great place I'd highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed a lunch here yesterday. My co-worker and I split an order of the steamed pork dumplings which were excellent. I had the pumpkin curry and chose chicken to go in it. (You get to pick your protein). You also get to pick how spicy you want it. I really like spicy food so I ordered it as a 4 (out of 5). It had a lot of heat but the flavors still came through.  Any more and I would have been sweating and struggling to enjoy it. The pieces of Asian pumpkin in the dish have a texture and taste like an almost al dente potato. Highly recommend. The service is fast and attentive and they easily managed the lunch rush. The place is crowded and loud (our table was 8\" from the couple next to us.) So it's not the place for an intimate or private meeting but if you want some great Thai food quickly it is a very good choice."}
{"text":"I've been here many times as well as their North Side location. Food is consistent at both places but I personally like this location a bit more. The decor is beautiful and their serve ware is also a bit more fancy here. Nicky's Thai has a reputation of being the best Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh and although I think it's great, there are dishes in which I've had better at other places. If you're in the mood for curry and soups, Nicky's Thai is hands down the best. I love their tom kha soup and pineapple curry. However, they can improve on the noodles. There isn't as large of a noodle selection as other places and the signature Thai dish, pad thai, is a little too saucy and sweet. Don't get me wrong, it's still pretty tasty but I've had better. All in all, the best Thai restaurant downtown but there are other Thai restaurants in the city worth trying before declaring Nicky's as the best."}
{"text":"If I had to choose between the north side location and the downtown location, I would pick downtown only because of the decor and atmosphere. Otherwise, this one is just as good. One thing, though, the north side location has an interesting smell (that doesn't smell like food) when you walk in. Has anyone else noticed that? Or maybe it's just me, heh. North side, however, has outdoor seating that is quite nice in the warmer months. 

The food has always been great here, whether it's take out or dine in. I've never had anything I hated. The service is also always great; your water is refilled after every single sip you take. My complaint with Nicky's Thai Kitchen is its selection of noodles; I wish it had more options that you usually find at other Thai restaurants. 

My favorite dish to order at Nicky's Thai is their pineapple curry, but I haven't had this anywhere else so I don't have anything to compare it to. Honestly, though, there isn't much you can go wrong with."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 5 stars but two things caused me to not do so:  the quality of the ground beef was not there.   Every other bite I got little hard pieces of gristle. Yuck!  The spring rolls were chewy. Not like thin wrapping that I've had with other spring rolls."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday afternoon with a group of 7 including 3 small children. No one in front of restaurant and no one eating in restaurant. A few people dining on patio. Waited about 7 minutes then went to hunt someone down. Came out to seat us and promptly waited another 15 minutes to take our order. Went to see what was going on. Looked into kitchen and our server was munching on some food. Unsanitary and unacceptable. These people had not a care in the world. Won't be back."}
{"text":"My family including me love this place. Their spice level of 5 could be too much but anything around 3 is pretty good. Love shrimp pad Thai, papaya salad."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio and outdoor garden ambience.  Food was just OK, not phenomenal.  Summer rolls were bland, including the dipping sauce.  I ordered the scallop special, and asked for an 8 spice level.  Why I got was about a 4, in a watery broth.  Veggies in it were nice and fresh, scallops were well cooked, but the dish as a whole was just... Ok.  Veggie dumplings were also bland.  Tofu and cabbage was good.  Glass noodle salad was good.  Again, nothing knocked my socks off, as happened at Red Orchid.  I'll give it another try (the patio is awesome)..."}
{"text":"Nice authentic atmosphere, relaxed. Great service. Extensive menu selection. Reasonable prices. Good size portions,excellent flavors. Started with Tom Kha soup and this was one of the best I have had in my travels. Had Pad Thai with shrimp for main course. Great flavor, well balanced, lots of shrimp.
Overall, very good meal."}
{"text":"This place saved my life. I was in PGH for business & the restaurants around my hotel were pretty dismal. A local recommended I check out Nicky's and now I can't stay away!

I eat a ton of Thai food at home in LA and I had very low expectations for Pittsburgh. Nicky's is the real deal. Every time I go I try something different and let the waiter order for me.  The portions are big enough to have a tasty lunch and leftovers for dinner. 

The mango chicken curry with brown rice is divine. It's very basic but the mangoes are freshly cut & dropped right into the curry sauce which may not feel right to some people but trust me. I asked for heat level 6 which was just enough to give it a kick & I was not clearing my sinuses every two minutes. I've also loved the garprow chicken lad kao.  It was spicy, delicious and the egg on top brought another savory element to the mix. Every dish I get has chicken and here it's the real deal. It's lean & good so don't worry about weird grisly meat.

The only bummer was their pad kee mow, or spicy basil leaves. For some reason every Thai place in Pittsburgh serves it with very little basil and a bland gravy... much different that anything else I've experienced.

If you're on the north side, tuck yourself into Nicky's. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Mt. Nebo road location. Horrible service from the moment we walked in. Hosts ignored us for 5 min. Then told us all tables outside were reserved. There were 6 empty tables when we entered and 8 empty tables when we left. We ended up sitting at the tiny little bar with the waitstaff bustling past us in and out of the kitchen. And the food tasted like dirty feet. Worst $50 ever spent."}
{"text":"Given the positive reviews, we decided to come here even though Thai hadn't been on our minds. I am so glad we did!  This place exceeded my expectations, fusing Thai flavors with modern taste.

I ordered green tea Thai iced tea (how unique to see this on the menu) and really enjoyed it.  My husband ordered the red tea Thai iced tea, which was wonderful because it had the right amount of sweetness, not overpowering the tea.

For appetizers, we ordered Tiger Cry Beef. It was delicious. I loved the sauce (found in BUN dishes), with just a splash of pepper - awesome.

For entrees, we ordered one of their new specials, Coconut Curry Scallop Basil.  It was AMAZING; see picture for evidence.  It contains scallops and eggs in a delicious sauce inside of a coconut shell, which was perfect. Separately, the dish contained coconut curry and brown rice, which was also phenomenal and can be eaten together. Artistic and exquisite - I would come back here for this dish alone.  My husband ordered their Hung Lay Curry, which was so tasty and unique as well.

If we lived in Pittsburgh, we would definitely come here all the time.  The service was excellent and price was decent.  Restaurant felt upscale with a cozy traditional feel and lots of Thai decor.  You likely need reservations."}
{"text":"As much as I want to give this restaurant a five star rating, I can't. I have had some absolutely fabulous meals there but for every great meal, I've had one that's been just awful! There is simply no consistency at this restaurant. When the owner is cooking it's great and the spice levels are good. When he has someone new in the kitchen -- which seems to be very often -- the food stinks, it's bland.. The boxed stuff at the grocery is better. I hope they will read this review and do something about it. I've mentioned it to them but no one seems to care. People keep coming. The problem is they don't come back if the food isn't good."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious. My friend insisted that I go there with her. Although I was scared about the spiciness level, I ordered a two, and that came out perfect. The noodles were extremely fresh and the vegetables in the mix were absolutely fabulous. I loved my experience even though this isn't the usual food that I eat. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Thai food."}
{"text":"Nicky's Thai Kitchen (in both the downtown and northside location) has some seriously great Thai food. Nice restaurant ambiance with plenty of different selections to chose from. Lots of vegetarian options, which is something I am always looking for! I particularly love the Pad See Ew.

I'm actually writing this review just to point out a weird thing this place does... in both locations... you can't go more than 3 minutes without someone filling up your water. I think management has told them that people always need to have a full glass of water but the amount of times they refill your glass is actually disruptive. It's a running joke between my husband and to see how many times they will fill up the water! Sometimes they even top of the water after they already filled it up and I haven't even sipped it yet. Both husband and I try to move our glasses to the back of the table and stop drinking water so that they stop disrupting our meal to fill our water glasses.

So next time you are at Nickys Thai Kitchen, count how many times your water glass gets refilled. We can't be the only people this happens to. I'm thinking about starting to ask for a pitcher of water on the table so they quit with water barrage."}
{"text":"Going downhill.  Used to really like it here.  Now the past 5 times I've either had to get my food to go because the service was so slow, or the food was just not good.  Today I had chunks of sugar in my pad thai and it was very very watery."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Nicky's a number of times now and I order something different every time.  The food is absolutely delicious and has some of the best overall flavor of any Thai restaurant around.  However, a lot of times when I want Thai, I want something spicy, and Nicky's seems wholly incapable of making spicy food.  I consider their \"Thai hot\" to be comparable to a three or maybe a generous four out of ten at other restaurants, and that really leaves me disappointed every time I eat here."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The atmosphere is great.  I would think I was in NYC not Pittsburgh.  The pad thi is incredible and the spice level of 5 is nice and hot."}
{"text":"Some of my co-workers and I love going to Nicky's for lunch during the workday. Like any other downtown restaurant, it gets pretty busy around noon, but you won't ever have to wait long if there does happen to be a wait. They're very good at getting people in and out.

You can't beat the amount of food you get. Most entrees also come with a soup or salad. And unless your appetite is huge, you will probably be able to take half of your food with you as leftovers. My favorite thing to get is the Pad See Ew. Their rice noodles are really wonderful. I've also tried a few curries and they are excellent as well. I also love the little crab Rangoon that comes with your meal. I often find myself craving Nicky's on days I've already bought lunch....

The one thing I'm a bit confused by at Nicky's is the scale they use for the spiciness level of your food.  When you order your server will ask you to choose a number between 1 and 10 for how spicy you'd like your meal to be, 1 being least spicy, 10 being the most. For my Pad See Ew I usually get a 3 or 4 and that's right where I like the heat of my food,lots of flavor but not burning my mouth. But once I chose one of the curries and ordered a 4 and it was so spicy I could barely eat it. I asked the waiter about it and he said that dish is already spicy to begin with before the scale is applied. So I guess you just have to be careful and consider the ingredients that are already in your meal before choosing your heat number!

I could really come and eat here multiple times a week, but then I would have an empty wallet and weigh 300 pounds. I definitely recommend this Nicky's location for lunch if you work downtown, or for a meal any other time!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best Thai food restaurants I've ever been to in terms of flavor.

The appetizers...yes I love them. 

Spring Rolls were flavorful and the dipping sauce was heaven.

Crab Rangoon (C.R.) is my barometer for most every type of Asian cuisine that I encounter.  My friend, when you buy this version of C.R. it will ruin every other C.R. you have ever or possibly will ever eat. 
The shell, unlike most C.R. shells, is soft and easily opened revealing the sweetness within. The filling: sweet, decadent and creamy with seasonings I've never experienced in such a simple appetizer.  I don't live in Pittsburgh anymore, but whenever I'm in town this is what seduces me to come back to Nicky's Thai the most.

Ok, Ok on with the rest of the review...

Nicky's has a spice rating from 1-5. Usually, most menu's \"spicy\" is a mild to me (raised eating habaneros), but this spice is legitimate. 

A friend of mine recommended I start with a Pad Kee Mao with a rating of 3 or less. I chose the 3 and boy am I glad I did. It was like fire in my mouth in a good way. The sauce on the noodles was not overwhelming and it left me licking the crevices of my mouth for any residue goodness.

Even after the meal the small cup of sherbert they serve makes me warm, while ironically cooling my still smoldering lips from the entree.

What more can I say if I speak of the curry dishes, the tofu dishes, the other desserts.  Just try it and taste the greatness for yourself! 

Maybe you'll even see me there.  

I'll be the guy stretched out on an outdoor patio seat holding a Crab Rangoon puff in the air and nodding my head approvingly."}
{"text":"Me and my wife came back again after 2 years during our visit to Pittsburgh. I would say nothing has changed with respect to quality of food service and ambience. All perfect. We ordered the crab Rangoon which we had before and on the spot- same perfect preparation. This time we tried the grilled salmon with vegetables in yellow curry and was very well prepared. We shall come back every time I suppose now that we see the quality is well maintained. The only minus point would be the green tea we had which was not hot."}
{"text":"For the best Thai food in Pittsburgh, enjoy a taste of Thai flavors at Nicky's Thai kitchen.  I've frequented both this location and downtown.  I like the decor both indoor and outdoor of this location.  So when I crave either the spring rolls or Pad Thai, this is the restaurant that best satisfies my taste buds."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in the city and quite possibly the best Thai food i have ever had. This is our go-to Thai restaurant when the craving strikes. 

The service is always good even when they are slammed with tables."}
{"text":"So happy to have Nicky's close to home.  Quite a gem of the northside and pittsburgh!  Try the panang chicken.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"I love thai food and it tends to be my \"go to\" when traveling. Not only was Nicky's subpar--- they charged $1 for hot sauce. WWHHHAAATT?

$1 for a extra sriracha? You can buy the entire bottle for $1.89. Lame and marginal food."}
{"text":"I like Nicky's, but have had several off experiences for togo orders. Once I got a piece of plastic in my food and another I bit down on a staple. Their food is great, just spicy enough, but I wonder what happens when you order togo that so many things end up in your food that are not edible.

I will probably still go there, but check your food."}
{"text":"I love the beautiful décor--really embodies that Thai feel. I called in for a reservation an hour beforehand and had no problem reserving a table for a party of 6. The service was super friendly and helpful. 

As for food, the spice level ranges from 1 to 20, with 20 being equivalent to fire on a plate. Even the spiciest eater in the group was content with just a 10/20. Instead of settling for the typical pad thai or curry dishes, I attempted to order something unfamiliar. It was a total shot in the dark. I ordered the Lhad Nah, which is a noodle dish in this thick gravy-like brown sauce. The sauce had the consistency of egg drop soup, but without the eggs. It was quite flavorful and surprisingly tasty, despite how thick it looked. The Tom Yum soup was on point as well, with the right ratio of citrus and spices. 

Overall my dining experience at Nicky's was really enjoyable. The food was good and the service quick and friendly. Prices weren't too bad either, with entrees ranging from $10-$20. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this restaurant is the bald guy who refilled my water everytime it got low. Other than that it's best to just stay away from this restaurant. My boyfriend got food poisoning and the staff was very rude. It took forever just to get our order taken and we only got silverware after asking 3 different people. So yeah, just stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food we've had in Pittsburgh. Come during the summer, and sit outside in their back patio, which is like a little slice of Thailand tucked away into a quiet pocket of Pittsburgh. The service is very nice, and the food is wonderful. Our favorites so far have been the mango tilapia (tilapia is usually just meh, but this is legitimately good!) and the pad see eu. The sticky mango rice is divine for dessert.

I'm not sure how this place makes money during winter, because it doesn't seat a lot of people. So, I bet the line for this place can get long. But, come anyway! It's truly a great little gem.

Note - the thai ice tea is a bit on the watery side for us. But in no way did it deter us."}
{"text":"A little hidden door restaurant, this place is a gem. Crowded on weekday afternoons and nights, I can see why. The food is absolutely amazing. Went for dinner one night and lunch the next day. Get the green curry, crab Rangoon, tofu tamarind or anything else they have."}
{"text":"Nicky's is my favorite Thai place in takeout distance. I love the chicken pineapple curry, but also the spicy basil stir fry and panang. The downtown location will make Som Tum, which makes me so so happy, but the people on the Northside look at me in confusion most of the time. Their fresh/summer rolls are definitely among the best in the 'Burgh, which plenty of fresh cilantro, mint, and basil. When someone asks me what are the best Asian restaurants in Pittsburgh, Nicky's is in the top 5."}
{"text":"OVER RATED: i wish i could give u a (zero) Went in with 3 friends, first time here. People can i just say sooooo sad. Save your $. Food was awful. Let's start with the gooey bland chixn Padthai. The Awful papaya salad soaked over night in (water) im sure to keep it looking fresh then fish sauce added (yuk) and i love fish sauce. The sticky rice that they microwaved then placed in foil to appear fresh like it was in the oven? I could have thrown the rice through a car window it was that hard. We almost cried trying to eat. We packed up everything to go as to not be rude because we didn't eat. It went straight in the trash. It was that bad. I YouTubed a video once and followed the recipe for chixn pad thai. It was 10000k better than what i had at nikkis. 
We spent over 100 for the 4 of us with tip. Very disappointed. Too much hype. If you have ever had authentic thai food i promise you you would never eat at nikkis. Amen and good luck."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally go to Nicky's, and it pretty much lived up to my expectations. The only reason I didn't give a 5 is because I don't know that the Thai was any better than a place, like Thai Spoon in Dormont (shout-out!), but with much higher prices - hence my 1 star drop.

I had the Pumpkin Curry with Chicken and I would get it again a million times. I've been on a huge pumpkin kick, but the best part is that pumpkin curry is not as \"earthy\" or autumn-tasting as something like a pumpkin pasta. It's a good change. Mild was the perfect amount of kick for me.

I personally loved the environment. It's not quite gaudy, but it's close and I have no complaints. All the shine and large decor on top of purple walls somehow actually makes me feel warm and I thought it was a nice change of pace for a downtown stop.

By all means, this place will be a downtown go-to spot!"}
{"text":"Back home I have my favorite Thai restaurant with my favorite meal. The seafood spicy noodles was way better than what I enjoy so much at home. We also had the calamari as an appetizer, also excellent."}
{"text":"The absolute best Thai in the Burgh! I've tried many other Thai restaurants and nothing is close to Nicky's! Best Tom Kha soup I've ever had! The back patio is beautiful and service is fantastic. Been coming here for years and never had a bad experience yet."}
{"text":"Came here again for dinner last week.  Another great meal with outstanding service.  I love a place that's consistent.  Prices were decent as well for the dinner menu.  Our wait staff earned their 20% tip for sure.  I'm not going to even bother trying out any other Thai places in town-this is it."}
{"text":"I've recently begun eating Thai food and can't seem to get enough. Pittsburgh, for whatever reason, has plenty of Asian influenced cuisine options so I seize the opportunity to eat Thai as often as I can. I must admit, Nicki's is my favorite. 

Tonight I dined plus one; we shared the samoas appetizer followed by green curry with chicken and shrimp pad thai. What really impressed me was the pad thai (typically left underwhelmed). Generally, I find the rice noodles quickly soak up the sauce and you're left with a chewy, greasy dish. Not here! Plus, they finely chop the peanuts which gives each bite a nice even consistency.

Not only is the food fresh and flavorful but presentation can't be beat. Curries come in decorative golden dishes with burnetts to keep the food warm. Portion sizes are generous, perfect for sharing. The restaurants decor is adorable - patio diners are surrounded by plants, fountains, and Asian inspired statues which enhance the experience. 

In addition to accepting reservations, indoor/outdoor dining is available upon request and staff are accomodating to parties. This joint is BYOB so don't forget the wine! Upon my last visit we brought three buckets of sangria and the plesant (and efficient) staff only charged us for one cork fee. Side note: I believe the staff is on tip share, something to keep in mind when the bill comes. 

Whether searching for a quiet dinner get away, a date night, or even a group get together coupled with a delicious (and fairly priced) menu I think you'll find what you're looking for in Nicki's kitchen."}
{"text":"This may be the best Thai food I've ever had in my life, and my party of 4 agreed. The prices were good, the service was quick, and there was a fantastic ambiance to the place. I called ahead to make reservations, which a lot of people recommended on here, and it turned out to be a good choice because the place is on the smaller side, although they do manage to cram a lot of tables in the small space. There were several parking garages in the area which was convenient for us as we drove into the city. The food, though, was obviously the best part of our visit.

It was totally out of this world. I got Pad See Eau, a friend got Pad Thai, and two in our group got the curry, and everyone finished their food despite the portion sizes being pretty big. It was phenomenal. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great value. It's a hole in the wall and easily missed, but do yourself a favor - don't pass it up."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Nicky's until a couple coworkers offered to order take out for all of us to grab for lunch.  It was good.  A little on the greasy side, but good.  The Thai style fried rice was rich in flavor and the 7 level was kicking enough to clear the sinuses but not so hot it overpowered the palate.  And while the portion side was great, the bottom part of the dish was greasy enough where the rice was rather soggy.

One thing is for sure, this is one of the few places where you can always trust the spicy scale."}
{"text":"So sad and grossed out at the same time.   I loved eating here until I saw the news.   #RIPNTK"}
{"text":"Chicken Pad Thai was pretty good. Great flavor to the thai chilis."}
{"text":"The absolute best thai food I have ever had! If you happen to be in pittsburgh then you have to try this place you won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"Yumma! Their green thai ice tea is bomb . Com 

Everything was delicious here as it was my first time.

Fresh spring rolls were surprisingly fresh with tofu! Delicious and they cut it into small finger pieces.

Tiger Spicy Beef was nothing special for an appetizer. Beef was actually really good tho. 

Pad Thai was great with beef.

Spicy Basil rice was amazing.

Tom Yum Soup was good, but I didn't like it with the chicken as it was dry. Try getting it with beef or seafood. 

Chef Special: Spicy Basil Fish: something I was not expecting. It was fillets of fish, but I thought it was a WHOLE fried tilapia fish ): but it was still tasted okay. 

They customize the spice to anything you'd like from 1-10, and I always get 10 cause nothing is ever really spicy to me especially at places like these who accommodates to non spicy eaters. 

*refer to pics for food!*"}
{"text":"Okay, I've wrestled a cramped hallway, the backs of chairs, and avoided having my head hit by servers rushing around with trays... was it worth the journey?

ATMOSPHERE
This place is much bigger than it looks with an inside and outside dining area--but it's still cramped! Every inch is stuffed with a human body scuttling about or dining. It may feel hectic, but also give you an energy surge if you like crowds.

FOOD
Our basil stir-fry, curry, and stewed fish (arg! I forgot the actual name of the dish) smelled as good as they tasted (and tasted as good as they looked) The veggies snapped in my mouth with that crisp texture and the meats were not drowned out by the seasoning. Yet there were still a lot of spices--but easily calmed down via the fluffy white rice. 

SERVICE
The servers here sure can dance the avoid-running-over-diners dance. Somehow our server still managed to arrive at all the right moments. Despite the crowds, we were also seated in a timely manner but beware, if waits are longer there's not much room inside to wait your turn. Step outside."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Thai food. I had the spring rolls as an appetizer and the Pad Thai with chicken as my entree. Both very delicious. I like that you can tell them how spicy you want it based on a scale of 1-10. Just be careful, my friend who loves spicy food got her meal at a 6 and it was very spicy. I got my pad thai at a 4 and it was perfect. What i also LOVE is that its BYOB. $5 corking fee but totally worth it. BYOB restaurants with great food can be rare. My only dislike is how small the north side location is. There is absolutely zero space to wait, just a crammed hallway so my recommendation is to make a reservation. I did hear the downtown location is much bigger. The service was great, we stayed an hour after our food to drink some wine and no one rushed us out. I am definitely going back and telling all of my friends!"}
{"text":"Very tasty Pad Thai. Sit in the zen garden out back if the weather permits. It is an escape from Pittsburgh city life, even if only for your lunch break. Beware that a 7 on the spice scale is pretty darn hot, eye watering- nose running-hot."}
{"text":"Fave Thai place!  Fast service even when they are busy.  BYOB at the north side location, bar is available downtown. Great quality food and of course, they do vegetarian well.

One thing to note - it is always busy, weekend or weeknight, but they will take reservations if you call."}
{"text":"I am just getting into Thai food and I do have to say that Nicky's Thai Kitchen is getting me hooked on.  

First, I am impressed with the interior of the restaurant.  While walking in, I thought this was just some cheap restaurant that my friends dragged me to.  But the moment I walked into the dining area, I couldn't stop looking around.  This place was TINY.  Super tiny but it was nicely decorated EXCEPT for the chairs.  The chair corners kept stabbing me in the legs.

I love their Tom Kha Soup.  The bowl was large, it was rich and all the vegetable in it made me feel good to eat it.

I also had their Pad See Eaw with beef.  It reminds me of Beef Chow Fun but with a sweeter taste (and less oil).  

I also had their Basil Duck and Seafood Noodle.  The Seafood Noodles were good but I didn't prefer it over the previous two dishes.  I wasn't impressed with their Basil Duck but did love eating all the vegetables from the dish.  Their Thai iced tea was good but isn't the best I've had.  I could be a tiny tiny bit sweeter.

If it is your first time, try the Tom Kha Soup and Pad See Eaw.  As a college student, I found this place moderately priced.  Definitely wasn't cheap.  If you're eating by yourself here, you'll be out a pizza and some wings."}
{"text":"Good food at a really nice price for the location. Its a classy restaurant that wont' break the bank like many places in the cultural district. Great vegetarian options and love the tea. I would highly recommend reservations if there are any events in town"}
{"text":"Food, service, and lunch portions were extraordinary! We'd definitely come back if in the area!"}
{"text":"We had a few dishes, Tom Yum was great (low on broth and then charged us for more broth), veggie dumpling special (not good at all), Thai iced tea (decent), Tamarind Tofu (delicious but even with a high spice level, was still sweet) and Basil Fried Rice (good quantity). Overall, atmosphere was great and staff was friendly and portions were large. They were not accommodating for broth and spice levels were not accurate. None of the curries were vegetarian either (never had this happen before)."}
{"text":"Less than a month after eating at their North Side location I had the chance to eat at Nicky's downtown. I actually like their downtown location even more than the other one. Like its sister location it features cool themed decor and offers the same calm and welcoming atmosphere (and quiet places to eat downtown are VERY welcome in my book!). Unlike the North Side restaurant, which is small and cozy, this place had plenty of room to seat a decent number of people indoors. In fact it was the perfect place to reserve dinner for a group of 10 people after a Symphony show, and we were all able to speak with each other without shouting over loud music or anything like that during our meal. Two BIG thumbs up just for that!

And of course, their food is as fantastic here as it is at their other location. A friend and I split their samosa appetizer - it was quite sweet and tasty - and I ordered the Param Chicken. When the food came out my rice was on the side, where I could mix it in with my food as I wished (a nice touch). You can also pick the spice level you want in your dishes - I stuck to a measly two, while another friend got the eye-watering 10. He's a braver person than I am! Everyone enjoyed the food immensely in my group. However there wasn't a rangoon with every meal, which I observed during my last visit to Nicky's - maybe that's a North Side/lunch only kind of deal?

I definitely have to send out a major thank you to the staff for taking such good care of my group - 10 people is not a small group and the attentiveness we received was impressive and very appreciated. Also, a word of notice: they called to confirm my reservation a couple hours before dinner, at which time I was in a Symphony show. Luckily I turned my phone on in intermission and got their message, so I was able to call back and confirm that we'd have our table. So if you're going to eat here after a show, keep this potential call in mind and be ready to take it or call them back. 

Overall I think this place can be summed up in six words: great service, great food, great place. Nicky's, I'll be back soon so I can sample some soup and more appetizers!"}
{"text":"At long last I had a chance to eat at Nicky's - I am REALLY late on this one, aren't I? - which has always been praised by friends as a great place to eat tasty Thai food. And I have to agree!

Admittedly walking in to this place is a little funny since it was built in a classic old Pittsburgh home - so, compact in the front but long overall. You have to walk down a long hallway towards what just looks like their kitchen to get to their seating area, which is on the other side of the wall in that long hallway. From there we were seated in their lovely looking if not a little small dining area, had our orders taken quickly, and also got our food fairly quickly. It was definitely a pleasant dining experience.

Firstly, can I just say that I'd come back here just for a glass of their jasmine green iced tea? It was infused with something - Milk? Cream? Seriously message me if you know what it was! - and the result was a really unique and absolutely delicious beverage. Don't worry, though, the food's good too. I enjoyed a fantastic order of Pad Thai that can be summed up in one word - yum! Everything was cooked, spiced and mixed perfectly, and after some of my past experiences with Thai food it was a relief to enjoy a meal that was tasty even though I ordered a mild meal. Thankfully Nicky's is not one of the places that confuses spiciness with flavor! 

Oh, and just to make everything even better, my meal (and my friend's salad) both came with a single crab rangoon on the side. Seriously, more places need to do this! I adore crab rangoon but ordering a whole appetizer can be a bit much sometimes. This was the perfect compromise and it added yet another layer of flavor to my meal.

I am now 100% dying to return here, explore the rest of their menu, and eat in their gorgeous outdoor seating area out back. Is it too early to start a to do list for summer of 2015? Well, even if it is, eating at Nicky's is on the list now - and hopefully I can come back before then!"}
{"text":"Another 4 star rating. :) I keep getting lucky at the places I eat at. Nicky's Thai Kitchen...keep in mind, there are two locations. We went to the one in downtown last night. Interior is really captivating. Tons of Thai and Thai inspired artwork all around. It's not the largest place and if it's an extremely packed night, you may feel a little cramped. Lighting is really good. Softly dim but bright enough to see everything clearly. Dress code...it's not an uptight place so wear whatever you feel comfortable in. Service is friendly and very attentive. Okay, on to the food! SO FREAKING GOOD. To start off they'll give you a spice level. 1-5, I like spicy but I was eating with a Russian so to be safe for him :), we went with a level 2. We ordered the shrimp cakes, chef's special the Param Chicken, and the Crispy Pomfret. Seasoning was phenomenal, wait time for food was way better than expected and portions were filling and perfect. Appealing display of food :). My only negative is the sound level in there. They weren't playing any music to set the ambiance and because the ceiling was so high, noise sounded twice as loud.  Other than that, new favorite place."}
{"text":"Truly the best Thai food that I have ever had.  Hands down.  It doesn't get any better than Nicky's.  I have been going here and to the Northside one for years.  You should make a reservation especially on Friday and Saturday nights just to make sure you have a spot.  It's very popular and people come in droves from all over to eat.  I have a co-worker who comes up from DC and says that there is nothing this good in DC.  Especially for the price."}
{"text":"Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, Drunken Noodles, Pineapple Fried Rice, Panang Curry, Sweet Basil Stir Fry - this place completely nails all of my essential Thai staples.  So you've heard how the rice can make or break sushi, well with Pad Thai that's the noodles.  They have to be dry, but not undercooked, and moist, but not wet.  Nicky's has that perfect balance.  I wish I lived closer so I could take out on a weekly basis.  Also that Thai Iced Tea, every day if I could.

Eating at the restaurant is also a great option, they have that covered garden in the back of the restaurant that makes it a perfect place to grab food and BYOB.

I love this place and highly recommend, but I'd feel guilty if I didn't mention one instance of contention.  

My fiancee ordered the Massaman curry, which came with potatoes and there was clearly a rotten potato in the batch.  It had black going through the inside.  The kitchen came back and said it was because the potato had oxidized, but I cook often and know that oxidized potatoes don't go black through the inside!  Also keep your potatoes in cold water so they don't oxidize!  We didn't push the issue, but were miffed about the bold face lie.  I have always had quality every other time since I've been, but my fiancee still refuses to eat there."}
{"text":"Appetizer was the Thai toast and it was very good. For dinner got the pad cha squid which the squid was very well done and good overall, but it was a bit over salted and worst of all when I got my leftovers the dumb waiter left out almost all of the curry sauce, which is what most of the point is to getting a curry item. I wish I could go back and take some of my tip away as I usually over tip but this makes me extremely mad. If you work at a Thai place, you should know the importance of this."}
{"text":"Food quality is consistently good"}
{"text":"I'm a Thai food fiend, and I've had a lot of bad Thai food in my day, but man, this place is GOOD! They have specials all the time and combos so you can try a lot of good things without breaking the bank. I also love this place because it's rarely ever crowded or requires a wait. This is my go to spot when I want good food, I'm starving, and don't want to wait too long."}
{"text":"The food here was exquisite. This might seem like a weird way to describe pineapple fried rice and tom Gha with shrimp but the word works because it just had a special flavor that you know took a lot of drag ingredients and a good chef to creates so glad we went here and we will definitely return."}
{"text":"The Thai food here was excellent, but the curries were pre-made and even mild was very spicy. I had the pumpkin curry with beef which had excellent flavor. My daughter had the mango curry with chicken which was too spicy for her to eat. She ordered the mango sticky rice which was delicious."}
{"text":"This just proves that I shouldn't review restaurants based on only one experience. I usually don't like to review a restaurant without having eaten multiple dishes, but during my last trip to Nicky's, my friend was just as disappointed as I was, so I figured I might as well. I stopped in again today again. The chicken noodle soup that came with lunch was delicious and the red curry was exactly how I like red curry - creamy and well-seasoned. There was enough rice that I used up all of the remaining curry sauce, and there was a nice variety of vegetables in the curry. There could have been more chicken... I think I found about 5 pieces. 

And it's a good deal. I think lunch came out to $9ish plus tip and was a pretty generous portion (except for the chicken). I may come back, but I am seldom downtown. 

I'm really on the fence as to whether give Nicky's a 3 or a 4, because Pad See Ew is the food that I would choose to eat if required to pick one food for the rest of my life and Nicky's had really sugary Pad See Ew. I think that the service was good enough to bring it up to a 4. On a busy weekday, it took 20 minutes for them to seat me, take my order, and bring me my food."}
{"text":"Went for lunch-- oh my.  Talk about a hidden gem!  It's a tiny little place tucked away into the North side-- looks like it was in a house at one point or another.  I'm super disappointed that I didn't get to see/sit on the patio- it was raining on the afternoon that we went.

Regardless, we walked in 5 minutes before they closed in between lunch and dinner (we had no idea, eek!)  But we were seated and served with no complaints.

We ordered the Fresh Spring Rolls (or Summer Rolls) as an appetizer-- yum!  the sauce was a bit different than what I'm used to; less peanut, more soy and a little more liquidy but still excellent.  The veggies inside were fresh and crispy.

For my meal, I had the Pad See Ew with chicken... whaaaat!  So simple.  There was nothing extraordinary about this dish except that it was well made with quality ingredients.  YUM.

What made me give this place 5 stars is the price that we paid for lunch; my plate was HUGE, delicious, and $7.  Blew.  My.  Mind.

I'll be returning on my next trip to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"You'll get absolutely no complaints from me about the food at Nicky's Thai Kitchen.  I had the Spicy Basil Fried Rice with shrimp and it was easily the best I've had in the city.  Next time I come I'd like to try something a little more adventurous, but it's hard for me to pass up fried rice.  This dish had big Thai basil leaves, plump shrimp, and a delicious flavor without being too greasy.  I asked for a spice level of 7 and easily could have gone with a 8 or 9.  

We had a group of seven and the service was good, with no issues having separate checks.  

BYOB so don't forget your B! 

Can't wait to go back, hopefully in nice weather so I can see the patio."}
{"text":"Some if the best thai food I've ever had. I lived in DC prior to moving to Pittsburgh May 2013. I try a new restaurant every weekend and haven't visited a place twice since I've lived here, except Nicky's! Which I've visited 4 times. Phenomenal food. Dishes I've never seen before and dishes everyone is familiar wish. I recommend the catfish, but it's seems you can't go wrong with anything."}
{"text":"I visited this place on the advice of the Yelpers, and it was lovely. 

I hadn't had time to make a reservation and they were completely gracious about it and squeezed us in. Sitting outside on the back patio is really lovely, as it really does feel like a little oasis. 

I had the red curry, which was excellent. Spiced perfectly and the vegetables were just cooked enough, but not mushy. The jasmine rice was also well prepared (I loathe mushy rice). I also had the spring roll, which was easily the best spring roll I ever had, with the balance of cilantro and basil perfectly complimenting the noodles and vegetables. The dipping sauce was also light, without veering into sickly sweet territory. 

My husband had the noodle curry which was AMAZING. I like my curry, but kept trying to steal his. Again, perfectly cooked vegetables and the rice noodles also weren't overcooked. However, Nicky's has only four levels of hotness--mild, medium, hot and thai hot. I ordered hot and my husband ordered medium, and his dish was easily as spicy as mine. 

Our two dinner companions ordered the chef special soft-shell crab, which I wasn't overly impressed with, but it wasn't bad, necessarily. The coating for the crab was a little greasy and a little soft. 

The wonton soup which everyone else ordered was very delicious. The broth was extremely flavorful and the wontons were so light and well seasoned. I could eat buckets and buckets of the stuff. 

They were quick to refill water glasses and attentive in their service. I wish I lived here so I could get takeout from here all the time. I would recommend for fresh, quick and extremely flavorful thai food."}
{"text":"Love their Pad Thai with #7 heat. And those little crab rangoons........I could eat them all day. Good service too."}
{"text":"Crab rangoons and pad thai are our favorites.  We always have attentive service and love the BYOB!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. I walked in for the first time yesterday and was greeted by a very friendly and attentive staff, ad I looked around a saw many people of Thai heritage dining in the facility, it's always a great sign of quality food when people of that culture are dining in. The food did not dissapoint! Check them out if you have the opportunity!"}
{"text":"Nicky's is my 2nd favorite Thai restaurant in the bugh.  There are so many here to choose from, so to get the #2 spot it's pretty great!

I have been here twice and the outdoor patio is the place to enjoy your meal.  It's as if you are transported to Thailand. 

Their spicy level is VERY high so be aware when ordering.  I normally do a 7, but I have to do a 4-5 here.  

I have had the LadNa/Rad Na and the Pad See Eww, both are excellent, but the Rad Na/Lad Na are better at my favorite Thai, Smiling Banana leaf.  

The service has always been spot on and course timing was appropriate.  I have also had the Thai iced tea here, it's a little too sweet for me, maybe it was the person who made it that day.  

Overall this is a solid Thai restaurant in the area and I recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, my favorite in Pittsburgh is the Smiling Banana leaf in Highland Park, this is a close second.  I have been here 2 times for lunch.  I have eaten on the patio both times which feels like you are in a beautiful tropical garden nowhere near Pittsburgh.  I had the Pad See Ew and the Rat Na/Lat Na/Lad Na.  The Rat Na is not on the lunch menu however the chef was nice enough to make it since they weren't super busy.  I do have to warn you that they do NOT mess around with spice.  I normally get a 7 at most place, but at Nicky's I get a 4.  I got a 5 the first time and needed extra napkins because my nose kept running.  So please be mindful of the spice levels here.  Overall I think this is a wonderful Thai restaurant, great service, and delicious authentic Thai."}
{"text":"If I am in the Cultural District for anything at all, I usually swing by Nicky's Thai first. The food is good and the portions are large, especially for the price. My husband and I can generally split an appetizer and an entree and have more than enough food (but we'll get our own in the name of next-day leftovers) and it's a really nice setting for a date night. I love the decor of this location, too! The staff is always friendly and the service is incredibly fast. The menu is also very large."}
{"text":"Nicky's is great. So far, the best Thai that I've found in or around Pittsburgh. The dishes are all well prepared and the staff is friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"I love Nicky' s so much. It's definitely one of my top favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. You can't beat going in for lunch during the week. That's if you can get a table of course. Get there before 11:30 or after 1 and you should be ok. The portions are big enough that I can generally take home leftovers. The soup or salad prior to the meal is great. I highly recommend the salad with the pineapple dressing. My mouth is watering thinking about it. I kind of rotate between a few different dishes. Phad Thai, Phad See Eaw, and the pineapple curry.  The level of spiciness changes every time I go. I can get a 3 one visit that tastes like a 0, and a 3 the next visit and it's more like a 7. If you don't mind being surprised you'll be fine. The atmosphere at lunchtime downtown is fast paced so you never really have a chance to chat with the servers. 
One other recommendation.... go to the northside location in the summer and sit outside. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food I have had in the United States. After visiting Thailand last year I have been on a constant search for good authentic Thai food. Their yellow curry is absolutely amazing and my favorite dish on the menu. Always good service and atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"You know when you go to a Thai place and ask for spicy and they go \"silly white girl can't do spicy\" and give you the weak stuff? Not a problem. My face is numb right now. I had the red curry which was delicious but wish I got a 7  spicy level instead of 10 so I could have finished it instead if filling up on water.

We got the crab rangoons as an appetizer which had a delicious filling but the wonton part was a bit soggy.

My friend got the green curry with a mild spicy level and really enjoyed it. It was pretty fluorescent green.

I would come back but would get a more reasonable level of spicy of 7 or less."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch last week with a big group.  There was a conference going on at the nearby convention center, so that bumped up the waiting time quite a bit.  It turns out, the food was worth it though.

We ordered a mix of things (two types of curry, classic pad thai).  The menu had a good mix of Americanized favorites and some more exotic Thai cuisine.  *Important tip*: they'll ask you what heat level you prefer (1-10).  We sampled 5-7; 6 would be about right for most people, I think.  Head north to 7-8 if you like to sweat a little.  Everything we had was very good.  Nothing to be head-over-heels in love with, but certainly Nicky's is a solid lunch or dinner spot.

Also note, the portions on some dishes are huge.  The pad thai could easily feed three people."}
{"text":"Best EVER! Great ambience and decor either inside or out. Friendly staff. Reasonable prices. Great food and nice presentation. You will not be disappointed here. My only suggestion is I found the beef that's used in a lot of the dishes a little bit too tough. I'm being really critical here. Seriously this is one of my favorite spots and I will be going back often"}
{"text":"Jeeze, this place has the reputation of being one of the best in Pgh. Definitely not at this new location. Outdoor patio is very pleasant. Service wasn't horrible, but rushed and with zero personality. Food was pretty bad. Shrimp was so overcooked as to be inedible. Appetizer stone cold. Pad Thai bland. Presentation on plate was an outright mess. Food was whisked away without a care as to why none of us ate very much. What is it about Thai restaurants in Pgh? Its a problem."}
{"text":"I've only had lunch here but it is the best pad Thai I've ever had.  Always a line but worth the wait.  They need to expand because there is plenty of demand."}
{"text":"Was in town for an event with friends and they suggested we all go here for dinner after.  Every liked their dishes, and most of us order from the vegetarian menu.  I obviously didn't try every ones, but I'd like to say the vegan duck curry was stupid delicious.  The vegan duck was definitely canned seitan, but the curry and veggies were amazing.  They will slice each dish to your tolerance, and I went mild cuz I had a drive back to Ohio, bit would definitely consider returning if their weren't so many other places I'd like to try in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in service and wrong food delivered.  The springs rolls were like grass rolled in a rubber hose ... inedible.  The panung curry with shrimp had great presentation but there was just something missing plus the Thai basil had stuck to the roof of my mouth.  I had to pick it out as they were like twigs. Shrimp was so rubbery. Just not worth an $80 meal. Plus the girl had an attitude when we told her she brought the wrong appetizer.  Mango tilapia was good. Crab rangoons good but they're near impossible to mess up.  Eggs rolls looked like the tiparella old time skinny cigar which probably would have tasted better.  I will go out of my way for Thai in Bloomfield... the best"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. We had pad thai, pad see eaw, glass noodle salad (amazing), and chicken noodle soup. But the one thing that disappointed us was the Tom yam soup!! Wasn't even near expectation. -_-;;;"}
{"text":"Used to be better (and the North side location still is). I just ordered take out and what wasn't inedible (like physically inedible) was totally bland. Isn't the first time, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I consider myself to be a connoisseur of pad thai, and Nicky's did not disappoint.  I especially liked that the peanuts were on the side, so I could decide how much to add.  The outside patio was great for dinner and there are umbrellas in all of the tables for those venturing in the daylight.  You can BYOB, and all of the servers were super nice without hovering too much.

It's located in the recently renovated Allegheny West neighborhood, and the only reason it doesn't get 5-stars is that it's a little out-of-the-way even for North Siders."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night with girlfriends. Made reservations for 7 ish. It was packed. There were people waiting at the door to get in. I definitely suggest making a reservation to save yourself the hassle. First issue, my crew thought that it was BYOB. Turns out only the north side location is. So we were there with our 3 bottles of wine that we couldn't drink. 

It was crazy packed like I said. So service was extremely slow. I was the first one to order an appetizer and my server forgot to put it in. I didn't get my egg rolls until I received my entree. I will say, the Pad Thai is sooooo good. Nice size portion, perfectly seasoned, appropriate spice level (lol, I recommend getting a 2 spice level).  It took about 45 minutes to get our dinner, but it was worth the wait. It took another 30 minutes to get our check. 

I did order a drink. It was strong, but it wasn't too tasty. A basil Hendricks with gin. Ugh. Don't get that if you want a fruity drink. Lol. But I drank it because I'm a lush!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Wait staff was very nice and helpful. Outside seating had a very nice ambiance"}
{"text":"Dope Thai food. Ordered chicken satay, samosas, shrimp pad thai, and a green thai tea. Everything had great taste and nice size portions. Our waiter was very helpful and explained all the specials they had. Do yourself a favor and make a reservation; it can get very crowded, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. It's a bit out of my way to get to but For something this good it doesn't phase me. I've had the tofu Pad Thai and then wanted to try a thicker noodle and found the Tofu Pad See Ew with extra vegetables was everything I could've hoped for from a Thai restaurant. The dark soy sauce is the perfect balance of flavors and the tofu cooked to perfection.  I enjoy mine extra firm and not many places serve it as such but Nicky's does, and it's something so delicious that the thought is actually even making me salivate while writing this. I've had take out more than dining inside however both my experiences were rather nice. The restaurant seems a bit crammed but quaint. Wish I could give this place 5 stars but the prices are a bit steep I end up paying more because I like veggies in my tofu Pad See Ew, not just 5 pieces of broccoli."}
{"text":"My date and I tried this place primarily because we like Thai, it was within walking distance to our hotel, and they said they could accommodate a gluten free patron when they took our reservation.  We both had the tom kha soup (mine w/ shrimp and #5 on the 1-10 spice level) -- it was AWESOME!  Incredibly flavorful and fresh ingredients.  Just delicious.  One of the best soups I've ever had.  He had the same but w/ no shrimp & no spice - loved it as much as I did.  

For entrees, I had the pineapple chicken curry and he had the chicken pad thai.  The servings were generous (enough for leftovers) and we both liked them.  The atmosphere was pleasant (Tuesday night, so not full or obnoxiously loud); the decor was the usual somewhat tacky Asian place.  The server was excellent - he understood what gluten free meant and could quickly point out which dishes were gluten free and which ones could be made that way.  My date was a very sensitive gluten allergy and didn't get ill so that was a win as it's always a big risk to eat in a restaurant.

Definitely recommend this place; it's a gem in the heart of the city and easy walking distance from many hotels, the sports stadiums and everything downtown.  Oh, and the prices were very reasonable for a downtown city restaurant."}
{"text":"Chicken mango salad with Thai iced green tea, best meal in the last year. Definitely Ty this place out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"There use to be a Nicky's Thai in Verona that I visited regularly.  I came here expecting the same.  The Won Ton soup was delicious and one of the better versions that I have ever had.  The Spring Roll Delux was meh in my opinion.  I ordered the Garlic chicken.  It was good, but nothing to write home about.  I was expecting more spiciness with a request of 8/10 when I ordered.  I give this place a high three."}
{"text":"I can always count on this place for great food and atmosphere. Ask to eat in the back garden, it's a must! The appetizers come with many pieces (e.g. the fresh rolls come in 12 pieces) whereas other places only serve 4-6. The food is flavorful and the presentation is beautiful. The staff is friendly and patient in making recommendations. Love to bring new friends here and will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai dish is none other than Chicken Pad Thai. Every restaurant has their own spin on it - some good some not so good. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Nicky's Pad Thai was wonderful. I like how they incorporate the level of spicyness into the dish instead of giving an insane amount of hot sauce on the side, which just ends in a world of hurt.

Also, the price is amazing - $8.51 for a lunch portion and they give you a decent amount of food. I definitely had leftovers.

If you don't like loud noises, I suggest you sit outside. You're jammed into a small room with a tall ceiling so the noise carries to the point where you don't know if you're even talking anymore. Other than that, I give Nicky's a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Pittsburgh for 4 years and have also lived in Philadelphia and New York. I can safely say that this is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh and easily compares to Philadelphia restaurants. Nicky's Thai Kitchen is literally a gem - I wish I had discovered it earlier. Great food, great service, great everything. Perfect place for a date. It's a small restaurant. During the summer time the patio opens up and it's pretty awesome.

The wonderful manager- Jean Paul - made some great recommendations including pad thai, beef pad phet, and (pineapple/tofu curry?), along with some ginger tea for the table. Soooo good! Thanks Jean Paul! Made my night - thanks for being so courteous and attentive even though the restaurant was pack on a Saturday night, dinner time!

Also, just so you know, its byob. I recommend you make reservations and not to be later than 15min...(store policy)...we went to the bar next door to while waiting.

Warning: Desert and food preparations are big!"}
{"text":"We love the food , atmosphere and drinks at this highly decorated little splendid place with great food and good friendly service. Sometimes we luck out if there is not a lot happening downtown and get free on street parking after six."}
{"text":"Such a beautiful outdoor dining area. You wouldn't believe you're in the city while there. Charming flowers and fountains (beware the one may squirt water on you).  The food is wonderful. I only wish they had a vegetarian soup like other thai places.  Simply wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"I've only had Nicky's Thai Kitchen twice, but I will definitely be back.  The first time I ordered the garlic chicken lunch special and crab rangoons to go.  The garlic chicken I ordered was a spice level 6 which I found was a bit too spicy for me.  The portion size was fair for lunch and the chicken and vegetables were cooked very well.  They didn't separate the garlic chicken from the rice, which I didn't mind because I mix them together anyway.  The side salad that comes with the lunch special had expired lettuce in it, but the pineapple dressing was really fresh tasting.  The crab rangoons were a little bit soggy on the bottom, but they had a generous amount of filling and tasted delicious.

My second trip I went there to eat with a co-worker on a Thursday afternoon.  We got there just after they opened around 11:45 and sat on the back patio.  It was a really nice afternoon, about 75 and sunny.  The patio was decorated with flowers and other ornaments like Buddha's and dragon statutes which made it a really fun atmosphere.  It started getting more busy as time progressed and the temperature started getting a little uncomfortable, so if it's any higher than 75, I'd recommend eating inside.  I ordered the cashew chicken with a spice level 4 and it was a good spice level for me.  I might go up to a 5 next time just to see what that's like.  The salad this time was great, the lettuce was fresh and the dressing was sweet.  The chicken and vegetables were cooked perfectly and it even came with a crab rangoon which was again delicious.  The flavors were great, sweet and spicy just like I like.  My co-worker ordered the panang curry with vegetables and said it was good, but a little salty.  She said she prefers Thai Foon's panang to Nicky's.  Although I would still eat Thai Foon over Nicky's, I really enjoyed my lunch and thought it was a better value than Thai Foon and a better atmosphere.  If I had one gripe it would be that they didn't give us any type of knife and both the lettuce in the salad and the vegetables in both dishes were rather large and hard to eat without cutting.  I'm sure they would've given us a knife if asked.  I'll definitely be back for lunch again!"}
{"text":"My first time here and Nickys was great, lived up to the hype I have heard from friends. The food was delicious, crab rangoon was very rich, spring rolls had a fresh taste to them, and my scallop entree was generous, fresh, and had just enough spice in it (ordered it 7). The patio is beautiful, with a new roof, the only thing holding this back from 5 stars was the service, waiter was not that great, but maybe he was having a bad day, guess I'll know for sure since I am already planning a repeat visit

great food, great enivronment, def check it out"}
{"text":"Service and food are second to none here. The best Thai dinner my family has had in years. (We eat Thai at least three times a month) This place delivered and then some, WOW!! Loved everything!!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this restaurant since I moved to Pittsburgh years ago and have always wanted to go. I've grown up on Southeast Asian foods my whole life and in my opinion, this place was overrated.

Their Tom Yum didn't have that perfect blend of spicy, sweet, and sour that makes it so delicious - but you do get lots and lots of veggies in it. My pad see ew also lacked a little in flavor. 

The presentation was very nice and the atmosphere was also great, but the flavor was lacking overall."}
{"text":"The steamed veggies are the perfect start to summer. However the sticky rice is slightly too sticky, they do give you a decent portion though. The prices seemed to be different online compared to in house, don't rely solely on what you see on your screen - give them a call and they are happy to help!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I highly recommend their Thai iced tea. Sweet and refreshing! The spicy peanut is very good, but as the name suggests, it's most definitely spicy. After once again stuffing my face, I topped everything off with pumpkin rice something-or-other dessert. Bonus, this place is BYOB."}
{"text":"The myth has finally landed I'm the golden triangle.

I have heard numerous counts of high praise for Nicky's on the North Shore, and they didn't disappoint.  Went early for lunch around 1140 and got right in.

Staff could have been a little more attentive...  it took 5-10 minutes to get our menus and water, but the food more than made up for it.

Pork red curry and jalepeno chicken slathered in their assortment of hot oils and dressings can't be overlooked if you like your stuff spicy.

Definitely will be going back again.

Update (second visit):  Went to Nicky's for a second lunch with the fiancee after I ranted and raved to her about the food.  Still rather good, however the service was extremely sub-par.

On both occasions its been hard to ask for input about the menu, and this time, it apparently landed me with an entree completely different than what I ordered.  The real issue came when I brought it to my servers attention and she accused me of being wrong.

I'm torn because I truly do love the food, but on two occasions now, the service has been below expectations.  I'll probably give it a third try and strike option as I still need to try the pad thai."}
{"text":"I tried a bunch of different things....but wow, they were all very, very salty. I have a high salt tolerance but it was even too much for me."}
{"text":"I got pad Thai with tofu to go, as well as the fresh spring rolls. Unfortunately, it was all disappointing. Because I came for lunch, I got a free salad. The salad was swimming in dressing, and was soggy and almost inedible. The spring rolls had too much rice paper used as the wrapping, and the sauce tasted just like hoisin with chopped peanuts on top. The pad Thai was dry and inedible, and unbelievably bland. I ordered it with a spice level of 4/5, and it had no flavor at all. I have no idea why this restaurant has such high ratings and I'm hoping my meal was just a fluke."}
{"text":"I ordered Tofu Red Curry. It was delicious and full of flavor. The noise level is very hight but the atmosphere is vibrant ! If you are going friday nights, reserve table by calling ahead of time !"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Beautiful patio(although i didn't sit there) I will definitely be back. Since I just moved to Pittsburgh, i was unaware they closed at 3 and open back up for dinner, so i was unable to sit on the patio and had to box up my food to go... my fault. Seems like a really great little restaurant though and plan to spend many summer days eating pas thai on their lush back patio. neighborhood is really adorable too."}
{"text":"Tried the garlic duck medium spicy, not bad and a lot for an entree. The place is a little bit crowded though."}
{"text":"Doesn't get any better!  Nicky know Thai!"}
{"text":"Anytime I visit a new area I always look out for the best Thai Restaurant in town.  I was recommended to try Nicky's where I was pleasantly greeted by the hosts in a small and very cozy environment.  The amount of people inside and the atmosphere really set the tone for a great meal, I felt.  I know these things don't play into the food being good or bad but when I think of my favorite Thai Restaurants, Nicky's felt like part of that group simply based on appearance and atmosphere.  I ordered the Duck Curry at a 10 spice level (along with a local brew) and was given a very large bowl filled with duck, pineapple chunks, cashews, and plenty of other ingredients that flavored the curry to perfection.  I mixed in my white rice and dug in.  The Curry was incredible.  The spice was perfect for my taste, the duck was well cooked, and the pineapple chunks burst with flavor every time I bit into one.  The portion size was certainly enough to fill me up as I unfortunately even had to leave some behind.  

While I can't say for certainty if Nicky's is the best Thai I have had, I can say it is within the top three.  I would put this toe to toe with my favorite places in New York and LA.  I was very, very impressed."}
{"text":"Friendly, attentive staff. Gorgeous little covered patio area (with heaters so even on a chilly, rainy night like the night I ate here you can enjoy it.) The food was delicious. It made for a great first-date location. I'm excited for my return visit in a few weeks."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I've never had Thai before and it was great. The menu is very plentiful. There is something for everyone. Very filled when we got there, thank goodness we had a reservation! We were seated immediately. Staff was wonderful and quick. Corkage fee is a little high, but that's alright because the atmosphere is worth it. Decorated nicely inside, tight seating. The place never felt too loud either though, which was great. Food was absolutely amazing!! We couldn't be happier with all of our options that we tried (party of 7). We can't wait to come back and try this place again! This is our new favorite spot!!"}
{"text":"I went to Pittsburgh to visit a few friends. We ended up at this place and it was amazing. We started off with \"Vegetable 4 u\", and it was delicious! It included samosas, spring rolls, veggie sushi with peanut and cucumber dipping sauces. I got the chicken pad thai and it was bursting with flavor. It was an extremely large portion. I was able to eat the leftovers for my next two meals. I definitely want to come here again."}
{"text":"This is the most delicious Thai food I've ever laid mouths on. Just from walking in and inhaling the breathable air I knew I made the right decision for a Friday night.

I had the mango curry and it was absolutely amazing. Large, supple slabs of mango and crisp strips of thinly sliced ginger made for bursts of flavor my mind was unaware were possible.

They had a full staff that worked together to ensure my glass was never half empty and my questions about life and happiness were never unanswered.

Bonus: the shorter server with the sight accent has a smile and a sideways glance every bit as delicious as the cuisine.

I highly recommend everything about this place!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai and chicken satay are really good. The sauce is delicious, and they also offer food in a pretty fast speed."}
{"text":"The best, Jerry. The best. 

The red curry is delicious! It never disappoints,  and because it's minutes from my apartment,  it's going make me poor."}
{"text":"A lovely spot in downtown Pittsburgh for authentic Thai food. Highlights for me were the Shrimp Cakes, an appetizer, and the Grapow. The shrimp cakes are full of kaffir lime leaf. Delicious. I make a Grapow at home, so I had to try theirs. It was really terrific. 

A note on the spice. If you ask, they will light you up. Order plenty of beer."}
{"text":"You need to make a reservation before you come here because it is always packed. I love the duck soup with coconut base and I love their red Thai curry. Their pad Thai is really great as well and their crab Rangoon"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  We go as often as our budget will allow - it's one of our favorite spots in the city.  The atmosphere is phenomenal.  If it's nice out, ask to sit out back - the garden is relaxing and beautiful.  The food is terrific and the service is always very good.  The crab rangoon appetizer is our favorite."}
{"text":"Yelp, you have steered me well again. This place was a breath of fresh air in a city stuffed with bread, meat, and cheese. The food was quite good, the atmosphere was great, and I generally had a good time. BYOB though, which is weird. Definitely the best place I ate in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great dining experience, wonderful service, and very reasonable (especially for the heart of Georgetown) prices. 
I'm giving it four stars only because it was the first visit and I'm hard to please, and I'd like to see if they can sustain their work at the next visit, which will be soon!"}
{"text":"I always try to find a Thai place that can come close to Bangkok 56 in Harrisburg, PA , because bar-none that is the best Thai you can find in America. When I was referred to this place by some locals...I was skeptical. Once getting seated on the back patio dining area (which is great during warm months) I had a hinkling this was going to be good. Well I wasn't let down at all...in fact impressed - this is bar far the 2nd best Thai I have ever eaten! Their food is fit for a king and is extremely authentic. I will return to this place and brings friends many times over. Great menu selection and prices. Awesome Thai!!!"}
{"text":"My foray into Pittsburgh. I absolutely love Thai food. The place is nicely decorated. I had the mango salmon and it was delicious. They have Singha beer if that is of interest along with other beers and wines. The food was tasty, piping hot, came out on time.
The only thing they could improve on would be service. The servers are slow and don't pay much attention. Took me a few tries to flag someone down. They are really pleasant just inattentive. I was one of the last diners there and they patiently waited for me to finish before starting to close up. Bonus points for that. Most places usually start mopping and putting up chairs as an indication for you to go, thereby effectively ruining your dining experience. Nicky's was very good in this regard. 
Overall, great food, good prices and average service."}
{"text":"Nothing for vegetarians, Everything has fish sauce in it.. 1 vegan option on menu is never ever available."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Pgh. The soups are heavenly good. Only negative is the cramped seating and chair-on-floor squeak noises.  The owner is Thai but worked in restaurants in L.A. and Las Vegas(I was told anyway)before settling here in PGH. to open the 2 locations.  I have been to both locations and even though the Verona building is not as elegantly designed and furnished, the food seemed better, somehow but at both places, you will find the BEST Thai grub in this god-forsaken city ... The crab rangoons are mind-blowing.  Pad Thai is perfect.  Other dishes on special are always good .  Hard to go wrong here.  Just wish they had more space. During warm months, try to get seated out in back in the very lush garden patio.  You'd think you were tele-ported to a jungle in South East Asia, somewhere and not the grubby crappy North side . Amongst Top-5 PGH. restaurants, imo . Gods help you if you walk in with a group and haven't made a reservation(especially at night ...) you'll be turned away or waiting forever ."}
{"text":"This place is amazing the food is impecable just make sure to make a reservation during peak hours"}
{"text":"Wow, a Thai restaurant that actually honors your spice-level request.  This is the first thing I noticed when I went to Nicky's.  Okay, that might be a lie.  What I really noticed was a unique Thai restaurant in a converted Pittsburgh house that happens to have a very extensive menu which took me well over 10 minutes to analyze before making a selection.  That in itself was quite impressive.  

The fun continued when the food came out: very hot, very spicy (as requested), and incredibly tasty.  There are so many options to appease even the pickiest of Thai connoisseurs.  You will not be disappointed.

To be blunt, this is perhaps the best Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh, or at least in the top 2.   It's really tough to say, I guess when you consider the awesomeness that is Smiling Banana Leaf.  You really should do yourself a favor and check this place out."}
{"text":"Ahh the outside dining area here really makes this place what it is..

The food is delicious all around. I love the \"sampler\" appetizer option. As a spicy food connoisseur I always opt for the 8-9-10 heat options lol. The curry is fantastic and I always lean towards a tofu/veggie option. Even though I am not vegetarian I sure do eat that way most times.. 

The service is always friendly and fast also. You can BYOB but I do believe there is a cork fee. But hey why not we brought a liter of wine with us last time haha!"}
{"text":"I took my husband out for his first Thai food experience. He finished all of his food and mine when I wasn't looking. Obviously it was delicious. Service was great too."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing staff! Everything we ordered was amazing. The special pork belly bun app was the best thing I've ever eaten in a Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here this past Friday around 6:30. Parking lot was PACKED, but there seemed to be plenty of seating inside and on the patio. Lots of people waiting for takeout. Wasn't starving so ordered the Tom Kha soup and their crispy chicken wings with basil. Friends order other dishes. The other reviewers complained about the service, but we NEVER had any problems. We were seated immediately and were served by no less than 3 people, including the very pleasant waitress who was from their downtown location. Everything came fresh and hot, and the water glasses were kept filled. The only small issues I have were with the large cabbage leaves in the Tom Kha - have never seen this ingredient in this soup before, and it seemed a little off-putting - and the Crispy Thai Chicken Wings could have been crispier. But the flavor of everything else was delicious and, all-in-all, would not hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"Never will go there again.  Place was nearly empty at 4:30 pm after being sat all the way in the rear in virtual darkness, I asked waiter if I could sit up near the window so I could read my paper while eating.  Waiter said he didn't mind, so I moved up front. Apparently this was some big no-no,because some rude lady started rudely berating me that \"you no sit there, you sit here-\" gesticulating to the back of the restaurant.  I simply informed her I wouldn't be sitting anywhere in her restaurant and crossed the street to have an excellent meal and service at \"Sharp Edge Cafe\". NOT RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"One the best Thai meals I have had hands down!! This is my first time to Nicky's and while parking is a pain, the food makes up for it. My 5 star rating is explained below on the basis of service, proportion of food, taste, quality and overall experience.

We went there at 10 p.m. on a Saturday, which was almost closing time. I have found that you get very good service around closing but on the flip side, you are rushed a bit and the staff starts cleaning around you.

Anyways, once seated we looked over the menu and made our selections (drinks aside). We got the Thai Roti as an appetizer, which was fried dough with curry and peanut dips, served with lettuce and carrot garnishing. One plate was well portioned for 4 people. While delicious, I was hoping to get some more curry rather than just a miserly dip-sized bowl.

On to the entrees: we ordered the Red Curry with fish (extra spicy), Basil Fried Rice with chicken and shrimp (medium spicy), Gap rap Lad Kao with chicken (medium spicy) and the Siracha Noodles with chicken (medium spicy). While their medium spicy was pretty hot, I really enjoyed the Red Curry too - a real good sweat!! The fish and vegetables in the curry were not an afterthought, and the curry flavors had permeated very well into them. 

The Basil Fried Rice was tasty in its own way. I got the strong basil flavor and the spice level was perfect. I usually find the meat in the rice and noodles to be pretty bland, but not in this case. Very well flavored again and in the right proportion.

Siracha Noodles were flat noodles with hot Siracha sauce. I did find the noodles to be a little mushy (overcooked) in places but maybe that was just me being too nit-picky. Again a great noodle dish and it was not too spicy (atleast for my taste buds).

Another star entree was the Gap rap Lad Kao. It had minced chicken on top of boiled white rice, and a fried egg decorating the dish. If you mixed everything well, each bite was delectable and it definitely had some punch to it. I was afraid that the white rice would dim the spice and flavors but I was surprised with each and every bite. Truly, another awesome dish on the menu.

I have to say, the portions were huge, the flavors were plentiful and the service was prompt. We probably got our meal in 15 mins (closing time means faster service), but we did not feel rushed at all. A pleasant 5 star dining experience, coupled with elaborate decor. I look forward to visiting the other location and comparing my experience at Nicky's."}
{"text":"Had a pregnancy craving for pad thai which had to be answered. I haven't been here in years... as in, since it first opened. The pad thai was delicious but the portion was small. I opted for shrimp and had to remove the tails from all five of them. Yes, an upcharge for shrimp and only five in the entire dish. You get a free ragoon which is pretty tasty and lunch entrees come with soup or salad."}
{"text":"Save your money and your time and try one of the other Thai places around town.  A group of us went to Nicky's during our lunch break for some good Thai food.  What we got instead was tiny, flavorless portions.  The restaurant was way too hot with a single fan pointed at the hostess.  When we complained about our portion size and food we had to talk to three different people and eventually the hostess (possible manager) came over and argued with us that it was lunchtime and that's why we had small portions even though our plates were bare in comparison to those around us and even in comparison to past experiences at Nicky's.  We will not go back here."}
{"text":"This was the best Thai food I had ever eaten! We were in town for a conference and once we discovered this place we kept on going back, we didn't care if it was lunch, dinner, or if we had more Thai food than we had ever had in a row. We just had to have more. So delicious. My favourite was a vegetarian green curry with mango dish."}
{"text":"After reading review after review on Yelp to see if this place was tasty and I am so happy we decided to come here. By far the best Thai in the city!!! The atmosphere was intimate and romantic perfect for the date night that my husband and I had in mind. We ordered and the staff was patient and polite. Food came out in about 15-20 and it was piping hot and very very fresh! My husband had the Massaman Curry and I had the Pagnang Curry. We also each had the Tom Kha soup with shrimp  and everything was absolutely delicious!!! I will never eat regular Chinese again, Thai is where it's at! And even more so at Nicky's Thai Kitchen!! Most definitely will return ... Maybe in a few days."}
{"text":"LOVE the patio. LOVE the food! Make a reservation-no matter what day or time! This place is a Jewel on the North Side!! The only item I was not impressed with was the Green Thai Iced Tea. Otherwise, everything I have ordered as well as the folks I've gone there with has been terrific."}
{"text":"Nobody does a fresh spring roll like Tram's Kitchen, but this Nicky's location comes close.  I had a pre-show dinner with a fellow fabulous Yelper and enjoyed a fresh spring roll and the chicken/mango salad as my meal. At $8.50 for the salad, I wasn't expect anything huge. I was WRONG. The salad is plentiful and amazingly delicious. The tomato was on it's way to rotten and the spice wasn't what I would call a \"Five,\" but aside from that the mango was wonderful and the chicken grilled to perfection. Bonus - when it appeared to our server that I was having trouble reading in the [very] dimly lit dining area, he quickly supplied a mini flashlight. Now that's service. Dangerous having this one block from work.."}
{"text":"Good Thai food. Decent prices. My only criticisms are the space itself and the staff.

There's a patio out back that is serene with great ambience. Unfortunately, the night I went was chilly and rainy so we chose to sit in the dining room. We were seated next to the patio door, which 6 out of 7 servers were not courteous enough to close as they entered/exited. 

The dining room itself is one giant rectangle of a room, decorated as you would expect with Thai art. It's brightly lit and extremely loud when the room is full, as it was that night. All in all, the indoor dining room does not make for an intimate dining experience.

Lastly, the service was good, but the staff were slightly over zealous filling water glasses; there's a fine line between being attentive and annoying, and that night they edged towards the latter.

Would go again, but would choose the patio."}
{"text":"Fresh spring roll appetizer was good.  For my entree, I got the fish basil.  I ordered a '6' on the spicy level, not having been there before.  (I didn't want to get blasted away).  What I got was what I'd consider to be a '0' heat-wise.  The primary seasoning flavor that came through was salt. The \"crispy tilapia\" was not crispy.  The eggplant was mushy, though perhaps that's hard to avoid.  Overall, it wasn't bad.  But I'd definitely not make any effort to return."}
{"text":"This has the best Thai food in Pittsburgh. The curries are delicious and you cant beat the aesthetics.  The decorations on the wall are absolutely beautiful and the dishes that the food are served out of are beautiful.  I have never seen anything like it before.  The price of the food is cheap for the amount of food.  My one complaint is that they ask what level spicy you want and its difficult to gauge exactly how spicy you want it.  The first time i ordered it too spicy and the second time it was not spicy enough.  Overall I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Finally the 5 star meal that I knew was coming. I have always thought that the waiters at Nicky's are professional and sweet. I get the feeling that they know they work at a good restaurant. 

The shrimp red chili just wasn't doing it for me and I eaten that dish close to five times.  It lacked that wow factor that so many other Yelpers had written about.  So on my last visit I had previously promised to myself I would change it up.  I went with the spicy fish basil, spicy number 7.  Talk about flavor.  Here I had found just what I wanted.  The spicy fish basil was one of the very  few Asian dishes I had ever eaten where the vegetables were every bit as good as the meat.  Finding the eggplant in the dish was like uncovering little treasures. Yes the fish was good but the veggies were also phenomenal.

The spicy fish basil has it all:  basil, eggplants, onions, shoots, tilapia and yellow bell peppers.  I am sure I'm leaving something out but this dish had it going on!  This was the first time I had ever experienced the herb basil used in a non Italian dish. I was blown away by the preparation .

 There was less sauce on the dish then I'm use to getting a Nicky's.  So I found myself having to tilt the plate and scrape sauce from the bottom to spoon over my rice. I would as for a little more sauce please.

I also would like to mention that dining here on Sunday night was my first time BYOBing .   I researched online what was considered \"B\" . I got a six pack of tall boys and brought them along as my dining companion.  It went over very well and BYOB is the way to go! 

 There are many  special touches around the restaurant too.  Here are just a few that stood out to me.  The golden chalice that the rice is served in.  The fresh yellow daisies on all the tables, and the gold flatwear and also I am so in love with the golden Buddhist deity statues everywhere it really makes the restaurant look opulent. I never gave up on Nicky's and I've found a dish that I love. Plus they have the best pork dumplings."}
{"text":"Thai food is rapidly becoming my favorite cuisine.  I may be late to the party but I'm still having fun. 

I ordered the Tom Yum mixed sea food soup, and green tilapia mango.  The mango tilapia was really  good, lightly breaded and served in a green curry sauce with green peppers mini corn, mushrooms and broccoli and fresh mango.

The broth of the Tom yum soup was absurdly salty. I tried to strain as much of it from every spoonful as I could."}
{"text":"Great taste! Friendly hardworking staff. Crying Tiger was perfect! And they had Thai Pumpkin custard! You don't even see this in California!"}
{"text":"If I could eat one meal for the rest font life it might be pumpkin curry from Nicky's. I dream about this place. Every time I go to Pittsburgh I try to eat here. Green curry, pad see yew(spelling?) and Tum kha soup and all the curries are my favorites. Much easier to park on the Northside than the downtown location and the outdoor seating is really nice."}
{"text":"Admittedly, Thai food is not for everyone. However, at Nicky's Thai Kitchen you can customize your order rather easily. Your server will ask \"how hot?\" and with your response  (1 -10) you can adjust the heat, or you can ask for the hot tray which has 3 selections including crushed red pepper, a siracha type red sauce, and peppers in fish sauce. The peppers in fish sauce is very hot so use sparingly at first. There is a group of us from work that come here (Western Ave on the North Shore) regularly and I cannot recall anyone even remotely unhappy or complaining about the experience."}
{"text":"Affordable good food. Was packed when we came here, lunch time on a Tuesday. We were able to get a table tho in less than 5 minutes. We ordered curry. Wild curry (real spicy) and green curry (sweet) The restaurant looks very Thai and the only down side is the noise. You can barely hear yourself. All in all tho, good good good food and affordable. The salad that comes as appetizer with the curry was very good too! I would come back again and again if I lived in Pittsburgh but I don't huhu So yeah, definitely a must try if you're craving for Asian food."}
{"text":"I have always heard great things about this place and have several friends who always give it huge accolades.  We decided to go to dinner here this past week with those same friends.  Expectations were extremely high, so high that you can easily be disappointed, however, that was not the case....not even close.  This place met and exceeded all expectations (mine anyway).

Located on the North Side, it would be very easy to pass the place when driving by.  Even if you did see it, by looking at it you may not stop in.  I would not blame you, but that would be a mistake.  

Our party of 7 was promptly seated in the outdoor garden.  It was a tad brisk that night, but the outdoor seating is covered and they do have large heaters, so it was perfectly fine sitting outside.  The garden is a very relaxing environment and really set the tone.

The dinner menu is fairly robust to begin with, offering plenty of soups, salads and appetizer options.  On this night, we let our friends do the picking of the apps and they were spot on.  We started with an appetizer special, which was a combo platter of an assortment of appetizers including small crispy egg rolls, chicken satay, and I want to say small steamed dumplings ( am missing two items but for the life of me I cannot remember exactly what they were, but let it be known, the plate was empty).  We also got the Samosa appetizer which was delicious.  The main entree list is expansive, very expansive and I find myself wanted to try pretty much everything on the list.  All entrees can either come with seafood, chicken, pork, tofu, beef, shrimp or vegetarian style.  You can also determine the style of 'hotness' you would like your dish cooked at on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the hottest).  I opted for the Pork Ginger on a level 8.  It was absolutely fantastic!

This place is also BYOB, so that is an added bonus.

The staff was very friendly, prompt and willing to answer and questions.  

I would highly recommend hitting up Nicky's, it really is fantastic food and the prices are extremely affordable."}
{"text":"First visit in town. Excited to get Thai food in this beautiful place. My husband and I order food (each one appetizer + entree.) My Tom kha soup arrives, his appetizer doesn't. I wait to eat for 15-20 minutes. No food for him. I get the suspicion that they forgot his part of the order and call the waiter. He heads to the kitchen, comes back and asks \"what spice level?\" 40 or so minutes go by... still no food. Ignored by the wait staff. We finally asked to leave. They charged for the beers but not my soup. A real letdown."}
{"text":"This is a fairly regular stop for me downtown at lunch. Nicky's Thai kitchen offers a large menu and quite frankly great prices and portions for being in the city. 

I went with the Cashew Chicken , spicey level 4. If you are a dare devil you can really go hot in this place but I don't need any rumbling tummy the rest of the day. They start you off with a tasty salad with sweet dressing. As for the lunch, just look at the picture.  The plate looks divine, the taste is great, service is easily under a hour at lunch. Plus the look of this place is neat.  Add it to the rotation or visit when you head downtown."}
{"text":"I tried the basil with tofu last week and was pleasantly surprised -- one of the better Thai meals I've had around town. This is definitely going to become a regular lunch spot for me, especially since they have a bar which makes meals for one more convenient. On a Tuesday around 1 PM, it was a bustling place, so you might have trouble getting a table!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here for Valentine's Day which is perhaps not the best occasion to review a restaurant, so I'll be lenient. The dining room is very \"cozy,\" and the table I was sitting at experienced an icy cold draft from outside which forced me to wear my coat  through dinner. The servers were not very attentive, but I'll assume that was because of the holiday rush.

On the plus side, the menu had many interesting choices, and the quality of the food seemed decent. I think I was expecting the best Thai food ever due to all the positive reviews, but I came away thinking it was no better than the other Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh. On the other hand, it wasn't really any worse either.

To sum it up, since the North Side is a bit of a drive for me, I probably won't be back, but if I lived in the neighborhood I would certainly give it another try."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting and was craving thai food.  This place is amazing.  I went with three of my friends and we each got something different.  We were all raving about our meals.  I have tried a lot of thai places and this place is by far one of the best.  I highly recommend stopping here if you are in downtown Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Nicky's Thai lived up to my friend's recommendations.  Delicious, fresh food, delightful presentation, prompt unobtrusive servers.  It's amazing how charming the outdoor patio is!  The banana coconut dessert is quite unique and beautifully presented."}
{"text":"A friend/coworker introduced me to this place and it is really good. A friend of mine taught English in Thailand for two years and he said that Nicky's tasted very authentic. I personally do not care for the taste of cilantro which is in a lot of the dishes that I've had so far, so that I don't particularly like. But that's my own personal hang-up. Outside of that, the food is good. Also, do not be afraid of the roasted duck soup. It is fabulous."}
{"text":"Does not take Amex. Would help if this was on their website."}
{"text":"Came on for lunch with a colleague.

Decor and staff were very inviting. Opted for the massaman duck curry which came with either soup or salad. I chose the soup which seemed freshly made and had cabbage, hot peppers, cilantro, mushrooms and a clear broth. It was very good on such a cold, snowy day.

The curry was excellent (ordered at spice-level 10) and was not overly spicy despite this. It had plenty of thinly sliced duck, potatoes a side of rice and a tiny shrimp puff. The flavor was quite good and had a wonderful creamy texture.

The condiments were also welcome as the fish sauce/hot peper/garlic combination added some extra heat to the dish."}
{"text":"Fellow Yelp friends got us hooked on Nicky's so we were very excited to hear that they opened up a location closer to us.  We stopped in for lunch on a Monday.  They place had a nice little lunch crowd when we got there and it grew as our meal continued.  

They have a large indoor seating area for dinner, with a small bar area.  They also have a small outside seating area.  The service here is fast, efficient and prompt.  

We ordered the crispy egg rolls and steamed dumplings for appetizers.  Both came out quickly and tasted really good.  Our meal also came with a small house salad which was decent.  When you order your entrees you can get them on a spice level of 1-5, with 5 being the hottest.  I ordered spicy peanut with beef on a level 3.  The spice level was decent, not as hot as I would have liked, but I know better for the next time.  The better half had the pad phet with shrimp at a level 4.  Definitely had a nice little kick to it, but she too wanted more spice.  We are into spicy foods so take our recommendations with a grain of salt, the level 3 did have some heat as did the level 4.  Both dishes tasted great.

Overall this was a good place for lunch and I would imagine dinner as well. I find that I liked the atmosphere at the Nicky's on the North Side to be better, but this place still delivers.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this gem while visiting on business. Best curry I ever had and I have been to Thailand. I sat at the bar and I asked everyone around me how they liked their food. Every person said it was the best they ever had. I had the spring roll and red curry. Omg! Amazing...try it! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Nicky's has been on my radar for a long time now, but since I'm living on the eastern edge of Bloomfield closer to Shadyside I've been sticking to Noodlehead for sit-down Thai and Thai Gourmet for takeout. After a long, cold day yesterday I decided to take the plunge and treat myself to takeout from Nicky's on the way home from work. I phoned in my order, and it was ready eight minutes later when I showed up to collect it. The lady at the front was incredibly nice and the space looks cute, so it's somewhere I'd consider coming back to for a sit-down meal.

I ordered the Phad See Eaw  with chicken at a 5/10 spice level. I like what I would consider a middle of the road spice level for Thai. At Noodlehead I get a 4/5 for the Phad Thai (It literally starts out with no spice to begin with) and a 3/5 for the Street Noodle #1. The level 5 at Nicky's was perfect for a regular evening. Just a little kick, but not too much. If I was in the mood for more spice a 6 or a 7 would have been appropriate. The sauce was evenly distributed and not overly sweet, which I really liked. The chicken and broccoli pieces were surprisingly good as well. Meat and vegetables can be sadly over or under done in all forms of takeout, but Nicky's did a great job. Overall this was some of the most delicious Thai I've had in Pittsburgh, and I can't wait to come back and try more menu options."}
{"text":"Great Thai cuisine in the Theatre District. If you are looking for somewhere to go before a show this is my pick. Its casual and won't break the bank like some of the other choices in the area. I had the Red Curry level 10 heat. Nice and hot!"}
{"text":"Yikes.... some harsh reviews for a location that JUST opened!!!  Hopefully people will give them a second chance, because Nicky's in Mount Nebo could be good - especially with how well their other locations do!

I have no idea what this building used to be before they remodeled, but Nicky's newest location is still so fresh, you can still smell the reconstruction of it when you walk in!  It is clean and beautifully decorated with gem tone & gold décor and has a really pretty outdoor patio.  I came here last Monday with my dad for lunch - it is conveniently located to our office, just 10 minutes away.

There were only a few other tables occupied, but I noticed during our lunch that a few people came in to place takeout orders with the hostess.  Maybe because the phones are not yet working, as other reviews might suggest.

I ordered the Phad See Eaw with veggies at a spice level 3.  My dad ordered [cant remember the name but it was] the one under  the Phad See Eaw with thin noodles in a garlic sauce at a spice level 3.  Lunch comes with either soup or salad.  I chose the soup (chicken rice) and Dad had the salad.  Both were good.

Our food was good. Mine better than his.  His had zero spice. Mine was making me sweat.  Slightly inconsistent. Large portions for the lunch price.  I like their Pad Thai so I would probably order that next time.  Both meals came with one of their amazing crab rangoon.

Our service wasn't bad, our waiter was pretty dry and monotonous, but he took care of us.  Two things, though: the lights - not sure if they had a short - but were flickering on and off the entire time and also....the music.  It needs to be turned down or the selection needs changed because both of our heads were banging by the time we left!


I'd like to come back once they have a few kinks figured out because i think this location has great potential - plus I'd love to sit on the patio next time!"}
{"text":"Authentic good food. A little on the sweet side and you have to like fish sauce because it is in everything. Inexpensive. Friendly staff like most Pittsburgh restaurants. The patio area was pleasant but, would be a bit nicer if there weren't so many colorful statues and less stuff."}
{"text":"Umm yeah, great meal!  My second visit to Nicky's was just as good as the first.  This time I ordered the mini egg rolls and cashew chicken vegetable entree.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed.  The eggrolls arrived, nicely garnished with a delightful dipping sauce.  5 mini egg rolls, that were fried, but not at all greasy.  Pretty tasty.  The entree, was very good, huge portion, lots of tender chicken, crunchy cashews, crisp broccoli, carrots and onion in a delightful sweet/spicy sauce.  I substituted brown rice ($2.50 upcharge) for the white rice.  The brown rice was much different than I expected, really dark brown, and a bit sticky, but yummy and a great accompaniment to the entree.  I didn't have room for dessert, maybe next time. Also my server Ben was very cordial and accomodating.

I'll definitely return to Nicky's!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, service is great, and prices fantastic. You can take a lunch date here and leave with a $20-50 bill, or grab lunch to go for around $8-15 for yourself. 

The atmosphere inside is nice, if not a little cramped. It can get a bit noisy in the main seating area, but the food presentation is great. I believe there is also outside seating which would solve the noise issues.

All in all, Nicky's Thai Kitchen is one of those great little gems in Pittsburgh. You won't be sorry you tried it."}
{"text":"An awesome lunch at a decent price. I'm a vegetarian lover of Thai food and there were many choices that looked good here. I went for the Hung Ley Curry with tofu. Delicious. And served with a tasty little salad for lunch at $8.95."}
{"text":"Good lunch with a fair price. I like to add coconut rice and there is enough for 2, even though I pig it all down myself! Yum."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good Thai food at more than reasonable prices for downtown dining.  While the décor and ambience is a little \"over the top\" and quite possibly too much gold and elephants, the meal itself is just what you'd be looking for in a Thai place.

Ample portions and good eats in a vibrant atmosphere, make this place a solid stop for anyone's \"Thai fix\" for food.

One caution would be not to mess around with the spiciness of your dish, as if you choose the path of spice, be prepared for its wrath!  If you like \"a good kick\" then a 5 in the hot scale is probably your best bet.  If you're feeling adventurous, then you might want to turn up the dial towards 7...and if you downright want to ruin your meal and take on something way too hot, then 10 it is.  Either way, Nicky's can deliver what you want!

At the end of the day, this place serves quality food that leaves you full...which makes it a winner in my opinion.  Just watch out for the shiny, gold elephants...they don't bite, but they may try to steal a bite of your food.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurant you can find in Pittsburgh. The decoration is superb, especially compared to normal Thai restaurants you may find in the corner of your street. Foods tasted great, although a little bit over-spicy to me. The flavor was in-questionable though."}
{"text":"Situated in the Cultural District, Nicky's is a great choice for a good meal before going to a show. I was served very quickly and had lots of dinner specials to choose from. It's a little different from your typical Thai restaurant, the chef is creative and willing to try new dishes. 

Although the Northside location is still my favorite, the downtown location is darn convenient. The decor is upscale and lovely."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Nicky's Thai Kitchen for several years, and every time I go back they seem to have improved and they seem a whole lot busier.  It's getting to be a very popular place, and for good reason.  They serve excellent food at reasonable prices.  Also, I absolutely love the patio garden in the back.  The decor and plants are beautiful.  I asked the staff who waters the plants, and they said they do the work and that it takes an hour to water everything.  Regardless, I love the Spring Rolls, plus just about any dish on the menu is good.  I ordered a \"7\" on the 1 - 10 spice scale and my dish was definitely spicy enough.  The wait staff is attentive and helpful, and our food came quickly.  I had the Chile Mango Scallops, and they were delicious.  I highly recommend Nicky's."}
{"text":"They serve really good and tasty food. A must try in Pittsburgh for Thai cuisine. My rating for the restaurant are:
Food - they serve vegan 5/5
Quality of food- 4.5/5
Service- 4/5
Ambience- 5/5..."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite Thai around Pittsburgh. The ambiance is unique while casual (Check our the North Shore location for a great back garden patio)

I've probably tried more than 10 dishes at this point and have never been disappointed, but my go-to is the Gaprow Lad Kao with ground chicken. 

I mean come on, what dish that comes with an egg on it isn't good?!  (Lunches have a bonus crab Rangoon too, sometimes)

The lunches come with a salad or soup, but you have to get the salads because of the dressing. It's like a Thai sweet pineapple dressing.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent Thai restaurant in the city on Penn!! The food was delicious and the service was very good. I don't claim to be a Thai food expert like some of the reviewers, but I know good food when I taste it, and I definitely recommend Nicky's!!"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food in a gorgeous, ornately decorated setting - with authentic spice levels!
Thai salads & noodles have all been good. Personal recommendations: grilled mint beef salad, panang curry, and basil chicken!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in This area. Loved it so much. Service and environment is also great!!! Strong recommend!"}
{"text":"Vegetarians beware!  This is not your typical safe space.  Many of the usual vegetarian items contain hidden fish products.  I first ordered a curry dish (with tofu), and was asked if I wanted a crab rangoon on the side.  Huh?  No.  The my server said there is shrimp powder in the curry.  I said I would order something else.  She then told me that all of the curry dishes contain shrimp powder.  All of them?!?!  So then I moved on to another section of the menu, and ordered a vegetarian staple.  Menu said it had black soy sauce.  Server tells me no, it's actually oyster sauce!  Wtf.  I think I finally got it on the third or fourth try.  Food came out very fast, considering we got the last table during a very busy  (and loud) lunch rush.  It was very good.  I had to deduct a star for the menu not disclosing the additional ingredients.  I actually worry just as much for people with fish allergies, they would really have no way to tell."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Nicky's Thai Kitchen. It is simply the best Thai in the city, and also the best service. I have been to both the North Side and the Downtown locations frequently, and they are always offer delicious food in a fun and casual atmosphere. 

The North Side location is typically where we end up, since it is easier to get to if we are just headed out for dinner. In the winter the inside area is cosy and warm, and in the summer the outdoor patio is beautiful, with a unique ambiance not usually found in the city. I even like it better than the outdoor garden at Pusadee's in Lawrenceville. We recently ate here on a Friday night, and it was bustling! We had reserved a table outside and arrived a bit early, so were on hand to watch the waiters and waitresses perform their serving magic, always hurrying around but never bumping in to each other. When we made it to our table, it was back in the corner of the space, which was full of patrons enjoying food and wine (BYOB, with corkage fee of $5. It is $10 at the downtown location, since they have a bar). We had brought a bottle ourselves, and settled in for a lovely meal. Our server was kind and patient, and explained to us the new options on the menu. We stuck with our usual appetizer of the fresh spring rolls, which are always delicious and served with a tasty peanut sauce. I ordered the green curry, which was perfectly spicy and full of vegetables. My husband tried something new, a chicken and shrimp dish with red curry. He enjoyed it, but wished that the North Side location offered the duck dish that he enjoys so much when we eat downtown. 

Nicky's will always have a special place in my heart, because my husband took me to the downtown location before proposing to me on the Roberto Clemente Bridge. But, I will keep coming back for the amazing food and wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Coming to Pittsburgh from the West Coast a couple of years back I have been desperately seeking authentic Thai food. I'm a deep lover of Pad Thai, Thai ice tea, curries, and well if it's Thai food I'll eat it. Unfortunately time and again I have had my hopes crushed with subpar wannabe \"Thai\" food.
Then a change of pace... I moved to downtown next door to Nicky's and my faith in humanity was restored. Nicky's is more than just thai food it's the real deal it's THAI FOOD!!! The servers are friendly, polite and helpful. The atmosphere is spot on it's like being transported to a shop in Thailand minus the 150 degree temperatures. If you don't sit at the front of the restaurant with it's large windows looking out onto the fun Penn Avenue scene you wouldn't know you were still in the confines of Pittsburgh, PA.
Their food is phenomenal, service superb, and ambiance enjoyable. I'll be going back there as much as I can and if you're downtown don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff! Lunch came with a choice of soup or salad. I chose the soup (chicken/rice soup) and wasn't thrilled about it but they had excellent green curry chicken and egg rolls. My son devoured most of my lunch! I'd definitely make a trip back next time I'm in Pittsburg!"}
{"text":"Nicky's Thai Kitchen is an attractive, very small restaurant with good, but not great Thai food. For that, you should try Silk Elephant in Squirrel Hill.

Although the hours state that it is open all day - at least on Saturdays - do not be fooled.  They are closed until 5 PM for dinner; there was a line of people waiting at the door 20 minutes prior to that time.  Parking is on the street, so it could be a problem, but was available on the evening of our visit.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  The dining area is attractive, but extremely noisy, with tables set very close together.  We were unable to have anything resembling a pleasant conversation.

The Crab Rangoons were excellent although the sauce could have been kicked up a notch in seasoning.  My husband and I judge every Thai restaurant by its Pad Thai, so he ordered Chicken Pad Thai and I ordered Shrimp.  Both were very good, but the sauce was too sweet for our liking.  (We prefer a savory flavor.)

All in all, we had a good dinner, but the excessive noise will keep us from returning."}
{"text":"Nicky's is a restaurant that's been on my list to go to for a long time.  So when a friend of mine suggested meeting for dinner, I suggested Nicky's.

We went on a weeknight (Wednesday) at 6 and the place was crowded when we got there and got progressively more crowded (and loud) as our time there progressed.  We went on a summer's night which was not super hot but with all the people in the restaurant, it did get a little stuffy, but not completely uncomfortable.

They had a menu of daily drink specials and one of food specials.  My friend got a Thai beer and I got a mango sangria drink made with pino grigio.  It was nice and refreshing.  We both decided to skip the entrees.  I got a bowl of Tom Yum soup and a mango and grilled chicken side salad.  My friend got two items from the daily special, it was called \"puff puff\" I think and looked like a miniature fried pie, and the mussels.

The tom yum soup was amazing, very full flavored and filled with herbs and vegetables (I got the vegetarian option).  The \"side\" salad of grilled chicken and mango would have been an entree salad anywhere else, it was quite large.  I ordered both at a 4 for spiciness, and it was perfect mild to medium hot.

My friend liked the puff puff but being deep fried cornmeal based app, she said it was a little heavy but very good.  She raved about the mussels.  She ordered the sticky rice with mango for dessert and loved it.

My only very small quibble is that I didn't get a knife with my meal and the mango grilled chicken salad had no mango on it (unless a very small amount was pureed into the sauce).  The vegetables in both the soup and the salad were in large pieces and it would have made eating them a little easier.  Of course I could have opened my mouth and asked for a knife, which I will do next time.  :)

Given the portion size, the prices are reasonable.  Everything was also very fresh and you could tell freshly made, too.  I would highly recommend Nicky's."}
{"text":"Once again, I move from Pittsburgh only to make a weekend trip back for a Breast Cancer Volleyball Game to find another great gluten free Thai place. 

Its downtowns so be ready for traffic and crappy parking-if you are from Pittsburgh know already know this-if you are not-be patient!

It was a saturday night and we did not make reservations-we actually were planning on going somewhere else that had a long wait so I hopped on this wonderful world of YELP! And found Nicky's. 

They sat us right away, the space is VERY small and cramped, you will be getting to know your neighbor very well. 

The menu is extensive, I was overwhelmed and stuck with the same thing I always get, as did Jason. All my sensories were overwhelmed by the menu, the hustle and bustle and the amount of people in this tiny place!

Jason got sake and I got the jasmine hot green tea. Both came out quickly. The waiter was not 100% certain of the gluten items they had so he waved another waiter over to help. She knew the menu well and informed me of some things I could and could not have. 

We started with the crispy peanut tofu-I loved it, Jason was not sold. He is not used to tofu though (the texture canm be different for some people). It was a large portion, I probably would have been full and content with just that. 

But of course I had to order my ever trusty red curry! Its probably the best curry I have ever had. I loved the presentation of the food (gold bowls and plates). The portions were very large, I took home enough for two more meals. I did have to ask for extra rice, they skimped on that. There was an extra charge for more rice. 
I ordered mine hot (6), and it was perfect! Many places do not get their levels right, this place has no issue. It came with peppers, eggplant, peas and chicken in it. They have other protein for it if you wanted something different. My curry was loaded with ingredients, again you don't see that often. 

Jason ordered the pad thai (this is his go to as well). He doesnt do well with spicy so he got mild. It was perfect temperature for his NY/Canadian sensitive mouth. (they don't know what spicy is). (level 3)
His had great flavor, sometimes thai can be very bland-this was not even close. It has an authentic flavor-he ordered shrimp with his. They were larger shrimp, not the little baby shrimp you see most places. 

The price was somehwat up there, I think our meal came to about $50.00 for both of us. 
I didn't have to ask for a refill once on my drinks-the service was that good. I could not believe the amount of people who were working such a small place, but they really are on top of things. If you read my reviews you know I am HUGE on customer service. This place does not disappoint on any level. I can't wait to go back to the  Burg' and eat here in April."}
{"text":"Nicky's is the best thai food around. Why? Because they do... everything... right. From their service, to the presentation of the food, to the quality of the food and finally the taste- everything is wonderful. The decor in this location is just gorgeous and it's so cozy in there. It's an escape from busy Downtown Pittsburgh that you must experience. I've eaten in this location and have gotten take-out, both experiences have repeatedly been wonderful. My favorite item is the masaman curry, I'm quite literally obsessed. Their pad thai is great, their salads are delicious- everything I've ever had I liked. Eat here, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I had to update my review considering Nicky's has become my favorite thai restaurant of all time. Their masaman curry is OUT OF THIS WORLD. Literally, if I was going to die and had to choose a final meal, I would choose it. It's incredible. I order take out from here incredibly often, but had the wonderful opportunity to come here for a friend's birthday last week. It's so beautiful inside- the indoor area is quite small and cozy and the outdoor area is an incredibly beautiful oasis. We tried their massive appetizer sampler, which was great. Everything was so tasty! I love their crab rangoons, and I found the shrimp cakes to be really tasty as well. I also ordered a small garden salad- theirs comes with mango, pineapple, peanuts, cucumber, tomato, etc. and a delicious pineapple dressing. It was so tasty. Of course, I had the masaman curry with chicken (spicy level at a 3- there's only goes up to 5, so keep that in mind). Incredibly amazing. I tried the coconut sticky rice for desert, it was SO good. Not too sweet, but really satisfying. You cannot go wrong with Nicky's.

Word to the wise: if you want to order extra rice to go, just ask for extra rice to go. Not extra \"sticky rice\" to go, like I did. I came home and was a little surprised to find coconut sticky rice in my bag. It surprisingly wasn't bad with the leftover curry, but still.. something to keep in mind :)"}
{"text":"Great Thai food in Verona. Small seating area but recently renovated. Good menu selection, with a wide assortment of dishes. Chef specials everyday. Soups are very good. Note that spicy meals are truly Thai SPICY!"}
{"text":"This seems to be a hot spot for lunch in downtown Pittsburgh!!! Even during busy lunch crowd, we had quick service! Portions were definitely generous for lunch pricing! Great variety of menu items and everything was tasty!"}
{"text":"Solid Thai food restaurant.  Big portions for the price.  Gets busy in the evenings and the restaurant is a little cramped.  Went with kids, bit they didn't have a kids menu or crayons or anything, so if you take them, make sure they will eat the chicken satay, fried rice, or dumplings, or whatever.  Ours did."}
{"text":"Not as good as I'd hoped. The place was PACKED and loud. I get it, downtown at lunchtime is packed an loud, but this was like 3rd class on the Titanic packed. In order to be seated, you had to run your ass on people's shoulders as you scooch by. In turn, asses are rubbed on your shoulders too... just expect it. The owners simply try to fit too many people in. So, you're crammed and yelling the whole time because SO IS EVERYONE ELSE. 

Anyway, the food: I got pork Thai fried rice,- good Thai barometer. The server didn't give a shit about being nice because he's obviously playing a volume game and figures he can make more money by serving more customers poorly that fewer customers excellently. The rice came out too spicy to really enjoy which I hate; and this is not surprising given the choices I was given up front about spice: \"Do you want no spice, sweat a little, or sweat a lot?\" I said \"I want a little spice, but I don't want to sweat.\" Either he didn't understand what that meant or more likely didn't give a shit."}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best Thai food I've had.  I've been to many Thai restaurants, and Nicky's Thai kitchen absolutely leads the pack.  Nice decor, excellent service, and the selection and quality of the food is amazing.  There's very little signage, so finding it is tricky, but you'll be rewarded for your efforts.  The appetizers are excellent, and each of the several entrees I've had are excellent.  

Great spot!"}
{"text":"Best that food I've had to date. We got the Tom Ka soup with chicken, Panang curry with chicken and red curry with chicken. Everything was very flavorful and fresh. We got a couple of drinks which were also very refreshing. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Pittsburgh. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"What a nice little place. The outdoor seating is extremely pleasurable. BYOB is a plus, and the food is great.

They do have sort of weird hours. If you are going on the weekend, make sure to check, as they close between \"lunch\" and \"dinner\"."}
{"text":"Love this place for Thai!  Cute outdoors area where you can BYOB or get takeout for a super convenient mid week dinner.  All the food we have had there has been delicious!  Of course, I have had the Pad Thai more than once but who can blame me when it is so delicious?  The chicken basil is also very good.  And always start with the fresh rolls:)"}
{"text":"Quite probably the best Thai food I've ever had. The Crab Rangoon is super creamy and exquisitely tasty. The Tom Yum soup lived up to its name with perfectly cooked fresh veggies and tender chicken. The true gem here for me is the Massaman Curry - delightfully peanut-buttery with great consistency and tons of flavor. The service was spot on, and the ambiance pleasant, if maybe a little on the loud side. 

... and the serving dishes made me feel like a KING."}
{"text":"I love this place... I am totally addicted to their Tofu Tom Yum soup... I love how sour they make it bc not all tom yum soup are created equally. The tofu that they use is the softer one and I really like it in the soup. Their fish cakes are so good too... they are about 2\" in diameter and about 1/3 inch thick fried to perfection. Service is great and food comes out fast. Their papaya salad is not bad... but not the greatest. I've also tried their pumpkin curry which is on the sweeter side from the natural sweetness that the pumpkin brings. I didn't like that too much. Oh... I've also had the Basil stirfry with tofu and that's yummy. This is a street parking kinda place so if you come after 6pm M-S or anytime Sunday, you can avoid paying for parking. I've never had trouble finding parking. This will probably be my once a week place if I can help it. :D"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, this is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh and vicinity.  I have tried probably 80% of what's on the menu and there is only 1 meal I didn't care for (the teriyaki chicken).  Aside from that, I say try everything!!   Nicky's is so good, I have learned to make some Thai dishes so I can satisfy my cravings when I can't make it to their restaurant.  It's also BYOB and I hear reservations are suggested (I usually ate here for lunch)."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and decided to try this place, definitely love Thai food. Ordered Pad Thai and Panang Curry and both were tasty! They use really unique silverware/dishes which makes it a fun, authentic experience. If you like any kind of spice I would suggest ordering medium spice - we ordered medium curry and mild/medium pad Thai and I definitely preferred the medium level of spice."}
{"text":"Love this place! So cozy and nice. The food is awesome, and the back garden is fantastic!! My only complaint is about the service,  it can be really slow. But friendly nonetheless"}
{"text":"I came here last night with some friends before seeing a show at the Benedum.  Seeing that they accepted reservations, I made one for 6pm, and even though we were slightly late, this gave us plenty of time to enjoy dinner before our show, which started at 8pm.  My friend and I had heard good things about the Pad Thai here, and when another friend said she'd never had Thai food before, that provided us with a perfect opportunity to try it out while expanding her culinary horizons.

We started out with an order of crab rangoon, which had a nice crisp wonton on the outside and filling that was creamy and a bit sweet on the inside.  Three of us ordered the Pad Thai with chicken at varying levels of spiciness--one non-spicy, one a 2 (me), and one a 4 (another friend).  After explaining the typical Thai options to my friend unfamiliar with Thai cuisine, she settled on the Pad See Ew.  While I wouldn't call myself a connoisseur of Pad Thai, I would deem this version excellent, compared to other versions I've had in PGH.  The spice level of 2 was just right for me--at other places, I usually order a 4, but thanks to other reviewers, I knew to tone it down a notch, since this place likes to lay on the heat.  As for the dish itself, the noodle:sprout:meat ratio was perfect.  The sauce was sweet, as it should be for Pad Thai, but not overly so.  The flavors blended together very well--none of them overpowered the others, making for a harmonious combination--as did the combination of textures from the main ingredients.  The noodles were cut up, making them easy to eat with a fork.  I also tried a bit of my friend's Pad See Ew, which was also very tasty, and which she enjoyed as her first introduction to Thai food.

Generally, the service was very good, with one hiccup: my server confused my order of Pad Thai with Pad See Ew.  (I checked with my friends, because I have been known to accidentally order the wrong item, esp. when two items have similar names, but they assured me that I had ordered correctly).  This mistake became apparent when our dishes were served, so everyone except me received their dishes at the same time, making for a bit of awkwardness.  The kitchen did rectify this mistake quickly, however--I didn't have to wait any longer than 5 min. The waitstaff also did a great job of making sure that our water glasses remained full the entire time we were there.  The space itself is beautifully decorated with shiny statues and sparkly wall hangings, and has a very festive feel.  Overall, I'd say this is the best Thai cuisine I've had in PGH, and I'd highly recommend it for lunch or dinner should you happen to be downtown."}
{"text":"I went to the picklesburg festival and decided to get sonething to eat ....
I saw this place with it's golden idols.
I never had Thai food before so I looked at the chalkboard sign and menu and saw some interesting dishes. 
The interior was filled with sparkly golden idols. .. which I liked..... and was filling up fast.
I ordered the scallops with garlic, vegetables and sweet chili sauce at medium heat.... they ask you how hot you want it. 
It came out with golden utensils and my rice was presented on a golden stand like an offering .... which I  liked....  
It was good,  I would eat here again.
My service was also fast even though it was busy."}
{"text":"There's a reason why this place is always packed to the gills by noon (even on a weekend) and gets its rep for the best Thai food in Pittsburgh.  I came here with a group and we were seated surprisingly quickly for how busy it was.  I got a nice and spicy curry, and cooled it down with a Thai iced tea.  I have zero complaints about it; it was absolutely delicious and I'm glad that they didn't condescend on that spice.  (Sometimes restaurants around here think you really want a 3 when you legitimately ask for a 7 or 8!)  The service was friendly and quick too.  For a downtown office worker, I don't stop by to at least get take out  nearly as often as I should be doing."}
{"text":"I came here twice in my week in Pittsburgh. One of my favorite Asian restaurants. Excellent service. Excellent menu (explained in English). Excellent pad see eaw. Excellent coconut rice."}
{"text":"Oh my god!!! You need to come here. I'm from Hong Kong and I always go to Bangkok once to twice per year. This restaurant is very authentic. It tastes better than Thai food that I had in Bangkok! Can you believe that? I ordered Tom Ka soup and green curry with tofu and veggie. They are super yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Yet another good Thai restaurant in The 'Burgh! 
A bit pricey, but hey it's downtown! 
We liked most of the foods ordered. In general more spicy than some other Thai places out there, so be cautious when answering how spicy you want your food!
Nice environment is a plus. Note it could be crowded sometimes."}
{"text":"The pad thai was nothing special.  In fact, it was not very good.  The noodles were easily broken which means it is overcooked since it didn't have the chewy texture it should have and the sauce was not impressive at all.  We ordered the chicken satay and they gave so little peanut sauce and then wanted to charge us another $.50 for another small portion.  REALLY?  Two unusual item was the green thai ice tea and pumpkin custard sticky black rice that is worth a try.  Again, more of a novelty than a cornerstone by which to build a Thai Restaurant business.  Pad Thai is really the standard unit of measure of Thai restaurants and if you can't do that well, then well, you really aren't that good."}
{"text":"I went to Nicky's Thai Kitchen last night for the first time. My friend was in town visiting from Cleveland and we both wanted to try somewhere new. 

Upon entering the restaurant, it was full of people in the hallway. Our reservations were at 8:00pm and we didn't get seated until 8:30pm. It seemed like a common problem on a busy night, but we weren't in a hurry and didn't mind waiting for our table. 

We started with the fresh spring rolls which were all fresh vegetables wrapped in rice paper with a peanut soy dipping sauce. They were delicious. I felt like it took the place of a traditional salad before dinner. We also got the fried tofu which came with a sweet and sour sauce. That was also amazing. I would order either of these appetizers again when I go back.

For our main courses, I got the Pad Thai with shrimp (I figured I'd try their signature dish since it was my first time there) and my friend got the Yellow Chicken (Chicken curry) with potato dumplings. I did have a bite of that and it was a little too spicy for me, but other than that really good. 

For dessert we got a black sticky rice with pumpkin (we had two bites and couldn't eat anymore of it - definitely not a favorite) and the fried banana dessert which was amazing. 

Overall - I give it three stars. Thai isn't my favorite cuisine but this restaurant had great food. It's a very small room and you're sitting very close to the people next to you. I probably wouldn't recommend it for a first date situation because it is a little loud. 

Being BYOB makes it nice - we brought a red wine (a $5 corkage fee) and Rumchata (a $10 corkage fee). We were confused about the difference in price and the only thing the waitress could tell us was \"$10 fee for liquids\". Eager to sip our Rumchata over ice after dinner, we just went with it, but not sure why the difference."}
{"text":"Had a great meal. The green curry chicken was very tasty and well presented. With soup it was a good lunch for $9.

The decor is a bit much. Imagine a TGIF, but replace the old license plates with Buddha heads.

Highly recommended if you are looking for a quick and spicy meal on Penn."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place so, so much as a badly needed new addition to the North Hills dining scene. Unfortunately, 12 calls to order takeout and a 90 minute wait (after being told 20 minutes for takeout) just isn't going to work. Hopefully this can be better with more staff - the food great, they just need to figure out how to get it out the door!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food.

I've visited for lunch a few times.  All of the food is awesome.  The portions are very large.  You won't leave hungry.

If you like spicy, they will make it spicy for you."}
{"text":"Didn't get to try the food but still had to post this based on our experience: We drove 2 hours through a monsoon to get there and when arrived at 8:39pm, we were told they closed at 9pm and we couldn't be seated. I pleaded and explained the situation and how we already knew what we wanted but still turned away and only offered take out. In my experience, you get seated up until closing time. Now It's a dick move to show up one min before closing, yes, but we were more than 20 min b4 closing and places like this burn and turn tables like the best of them and you still offer take-out? Totally disappointed. Especially seeing tons of patrons in there and several just getting drinks, probably didn't get their food order in yet. I'll give the place another try but all in all, that experience sucked..."}
{"text":"It was my first time there with my mom recently. Decided to swing by because we were in the area that afternoon. Mom loved the atmosphere... Felt so zen and relax with all the Buddha statues around the room and the music was very soothing too. 

I ordered crab rangoons for appetizer and chicken penang curry spicy level 8. So good. Mom ordered the vegetable pad thai and she really liked that too. Every entree comes with a house soup or a house salad but by the time we came the house soup were out so we settled for the salad. Which is fine too bc the dressing was very good. 

Definitely will come back soon bc we loved the food and the service was very friendly. Wish we came a little earlier in the afternoon though so we didn't have to rush and eat (we got there at like 2:40) bc the lunch/kitchen closed at 3 then open back at 5 for dinner time."}
{"text":"We are fairly regular customers on Sunday nights. We bring 2 bottles of wine, even our own red wine glasses, and we each have 3 courses. There use to be no corkage. We went in last night and they told us $5 per bottle which is a big increase from nothing. We asked if they could just charge us for the one bottle since we were unaware of the change and were told no. We asked nicely again and were told 2 bottles would be $10.  We just left. A simple courtesy could have been in order since we have frequented this restaurant since they opened. I have recommended this place to many wine drinkers but no more."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd get into Thai food, but yesterday was one of those mornings when I just plain ole forgot to pack a lunch.  I was getting a little tired of the typical burgers, hoagies, hotdogs, and pizza slices.  Well a coworker suggested Nicky's and indeed a few of my subordinates order from here quite frequently.

Nicky's has some good, reasonably priced lunch specials.  For about 8 bucks or so, you can get a complete lunch with either soup or salad.  I tried the chicken basil with garlic, eggplant, and a whole bunch of Asian veggies too numerous to list.  The chicken was tender, the veggies fresh, and the garlic not overpowering.  I'm normally a soup maven, but I tried the salad with the pineapple dressing and found it very refreshing.

I'm not sure if Thai will become my everyday \"go to\" cuisine, but Nicky's was a nice change of pace and I'll recommend it for our next supervisors luncheon."}
{"text":"Best Thai food ever! And that's coming from New York! I guess only Thailand can compete ..."}
{"text":"I wasn't really impressed with Nicky's Thai Kitchen which is really disappointing because I had such high hopes for it. The dining space is small and kind of cramped, the service was a little slow, and my meal was mediocre. 

I did enjoy the fried tofu (I'm obsessed with fried tofu) and crab rangoons as appetizers. They were both well done items. The thai iced tea was also a hit.

I got the Thai Style Fried Rice for me meal and thought it was kind of bland, but maybe that was my fault for picking a fried rice. If I ever make it back, I'll probably try one of their noodles. 

I know a lot of people have had a better experience than I did, so maybe it's just a matter of finding the dishes I like for me to fall in love with Nicky's."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the North. It is hard to find non-chain establishments up here that aren't your standard American fare. When I first saw that this place was literally right next to 79, I was concerned about the atmosphere of its patio, but they did a fantastic job. It is very large, lush and had to cost a ton of money. Outdoor dining is also something the North Hills lack and this is a great option. The interior is also nicely decorated. The food is what you expect of Nicky's. It is high quality Thai cuisine. I don't think I've ever had anything here that I didn't like."}
{"text":"Not bad, but really not worthy of rave reviews either. They have a nice outdoor seating area and the place does have a certain charm to it, but the food is a bit heavy-handed and clumsy to be considered anything beyond above average. Sorry Pittsburgh, but it's just not all that ..."}
{"text":"Food and portion size are exceptional, I've had everyone of their curries and they are on point. Only concern I have is that their spicy scale is not consistent. I usually get the 4/5 and sometimes is fire hot and sometimes is underwhelming (but more times than not it's good). I'd recommend this place to anyone. I've only eaten in 4 times there but usually get take out. My girlfriend usually can break her Pad Thai down into 3 meals and bring for lunch. We get 2 dinners and it's usually around $27, good deal for the amount."}
{"text":"So being from the beautiful Bay Area, I am definitely an Asian food snob. My work friends took me here and said \"it's really good.\" I thought \"pfft yeah right.\" Boy was I so happy to be wrong! It was delicious! I tried the Chef Special the Gaprow Lad Kao. It was a dish served on a bed of rice with ground chicken, basil, spices, red pepper, and an over easy egg on top with a yolk so tender that as soon as you touched it, the ooze would coat the dish giving the rice and the chicken some moisture and richness. I loved it. I also got a Thai Iced tea on the side. 

I ordered spicy level 10 and I feel that the kitchen went a little easy on me, but it was still delicious and I felt that beautiful kick."}
{"text":"Disappointing.

The reviews for this place were really good, but overall, the food and the service were a letdown. 

I ordered takeout chicken pad thai, tom yum soup, and crab rangoons. 

The pad thai was the worst of the bunch. Heavy on the noodles, not enough sauce, making the dish dry.. and the chicken was dry, as well.

The tom yum soup wasn't bad, it was actually pretty good.

The crab rangoons were very good. 

The review would have been higher if the entree was great and the appetizer failed, but... this was a flop of a dinner.

Also, the woman answering the phone was rushed and a bit rude."}
{"text":"I wound up here for dinner twice during my 4-day business trip to Pittsburgh. It's pretty rare I eat at the same place twice on such a short trip, so that's all you really need to know. 

Both times Nikki's accommodated our oversized groups with ease. Service was efficient. Checks were split perfectly. Food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.

Nikki's lets your order your dish spicy on a scale of 1-10 or 20 (Thai Spicy). My group was all over that range. A few people ordered a Pad Thai = 1. One brave soul ordered her curry at 20. Everyone was happy with what they received. 

Definitely was on the best places to eat in downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I never leave yelp reviews but for this place it's a must. Fresh, very trustworthy ingredients. Every experience that I've had at the Thai kitchen in downtown and also on north shore is great. The employees are super friendly and the food is great. It's a great Thai experience for someone who has never had it before or for someone with limited knowledge. Idk my servers name but my husband and I were there on Super Bowl Sunday on north shore and she was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Everything that you've heard of this place is true! Great food fast service! And friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Nicky's is a classic Thai restaurant in terms of menu and decor. The dining room was completely remodeled. It's attractive in a Thai sort of way and displays more gold than Trump Tower. The wall decorations, tableware, serving bowls are all gold. The vast menu is pure Thai, with all of the standard items you expect plus a number of others, and a long list of specials. It might be a little too much choice for those of us who are indecisive. It's also a lot to expect from the kitchen. Our dinners were pretty good - pad Thai and cashew shrimp with the samosa appetizer- pretty standard stuff. Spice levels were as expected but be advised that they use a 5 point scale not the more typical 10 point version. There is a pretty good wine list with adequate choice and fair prices. Service, which many reviewers criticized, was good, if a little unusual. The restaurant was nearly empty, so the servers were not stressed. We were served by at least 5 different people. Overall Nicky's is a pretty good weekday dinner choice. I would avoid the weekends until the service issues are completely resolved."}
{"text":"I love the menu at Nicky's.  the food is always fantastic as is the service. I only gave it 4 out of 5 because of the noise level inside. Can't wait for warmer weather so we can sit outside."}
{"text":"I have been to Nicky's on Western Ave in North Side many times, have had take out from Mt Nebo several times and are outside at Mt Nebo once.  When we ate at Mt Nebo in July 2017, we noticed the dishes were significantly spicier than the same ones we had previously. We happen to like spicy so it was great for us, but we were happy we took the server's advice and chose lower numbers for spice levels. The outside atmosphere is great at both places. We will return."}
{"text":"I would have given four stars but they lost a star at the end. The food was very delicious as always. I had the pineapple curry with shrimp. My girlfriend had the wild curry. My suggestion is when ordering your heat level remember to take into account if your curry is sweet or not. This effects the end result. The food is good and the service was above par. The only thing is when we got the remainder of the food to go they wrapped our curry and rice together in a to go bowel instead of separate. This gave me a rice curry soup when I got home. Not a good practice in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is a good little Thai place.  It's a small location, but the food is great and the atmosphere is authentic.

Pros:
Food is fantastic (especially love the Crab Rangoon and the Pineapple Fried Rice)
Service is prompt
Staff is very helpful
Atmosphere is wonderful

Cons:
Small interior (it's a good idea to make reservations for the weekends)
Street parking only (but this is Pittsburgh and that's to be expected)

In summary, this is a great place to satisfy a craving for Thai food.  While the interior is small, if you're visiting while the weather is nice, they do have an outdoor seating area.  Definitely make reservations on the weekends."}
{"text":"Had Pad Thai for the first time today and I don't think anywhere else will ever compare. Wonderful service, wonderful decor, affordable and wonderful food- I had an excellent time."}
{"text":"Great place. Attentive wait staff. Very good tasty food. Nice atmosphere. Had papaya salad and curry with chicken. Delicious. Excellent value."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious! I ordered takeout while in town for a convention - tofu basil and spring rolls. Though I ordered by entrée medium spicy, it had basically negative amounts of spicy - I detected no heat whatsoever, which is usually important to me in a thai dish! So that was disappointing, but everything else was great. The dish was full of fresh veggies. I found it interesting the \"brown rice\" was really more of a black rice. Very tasty! 
I'd love to visit again the next time I'm in Pittsburgh! The menu had a wide selection and deciding was difficult."}
{"text":"For a man who claims to love Panang curry as much as I do, how on earth did I resist their special of softshell crab panang curry?  I can totally see why this place has gotten the high reviews, it's cozy, the service is good, and they even have an elderly Thai woman working in the kitchen (can't get much more authentic than that)!

Instead of the softshell panang, I went with their \"signature\" mixed seafood pad thai.  As soon as I saw it.....smelled it, I immediately regretted my decision.  When you think of ideal seafood, you might think of pristine scallops and shrimp, and crabs gently plucked out of the crystal blue waters surrounding, say, Fiji.  The seafood in this Pad Thai looked like it was dragged in off the coast of New Jersey, pulled up in oily nets and left to sit in the smog filled air.  It was not good.  To be honest, the shrimp wasn't even edible, and the pungent taste kind of scared me off from the rest of the large white \"seafood\" chunks on my plate.  The rest of the flavors were decent, although I got absolutely NO heat from my medium spice preference.

Don't get me wrong, I'd definitely come back to this place, and I'm sure it's great, just avoid the seafood pad thai."}
{"text":"Pretty good Thai food and was decently priced for lunch.  The line was out the door and we had no reservation however we were seated relatively quickly and go our food pretty fast.

They allow you to pick spice level from 1-10.  I of course got 10 and it was nice and hot.  I had the jalapeno peanut dish with tofu.  It was great!"}
{"text":"My favorite go-to take out Asian! Two blocks from our apartment Nikki's is convenient, reasonably priced and consistent."}
{"text":"Delicious curries we great flavor. Good soup and appetizers like fresh rolls and pork dumplings. 
The patio in the back is a great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Thai food in Pittsburgh! Loved it! Everything from the soup to the fried rice to pad kee mao everything was delicious! And guess what it is so wallet friendly in this restaurant we had 2 appetizers and 3 entrée it was only about $60. The service is very good, lovely decor!"}
{"text":"I had the vegan duck and it was amazing!  I ordered a level three on the spicy scale and it was the perfect balance of flavor and heat.  Any spicier and I may not have enjoyed it as much. The decor is beautiful and the staff is so helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Loved it! Crab Rangoon's are crispy and the filling is perfect. Pad Thai is delicious. Spicy levels are very accurate. Best fried rice I've ever had. Best Asian cuisine I've ever had, this will be my Asian go to choice. Soup was perfect and clean (not sure what it was...cilantro with rice and some protein?). I only had take out but the people were nice. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food: Oh my goooooosh- soooooooo good! Came here for the first time a few months ago and I got the mango curry. Yes, mango! I've never had anything like it- it was delicious!

Service: Service was excellent- servers very attentive. 

Ambiance: Unique, but in a good way! I really liked the decor. It kind of reminded me of a restaurant in a larger city like NYC or Chicago- loved it!"}
{"text":"This was my first foray into Thai food, and Nicky's has me hooked. The atmosphere is great, staff is pleasant, and the food is delicious. I was impressed by the low costs and quality and authenticity of the food. I can see why this place comes highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying Nicky's but was underwhelmed. Ordered the crab rangoons which were a bit salty and greasy compared to the ones I get at other Thai restaurants. Also ordered the pad see eaw which was okay. We asked for the hot chili peppers/oils to three different people but never got them :("}
{"text":"The mango green curry tofu was phenomenal! Lots of energy in this restaurant - customers clearly having a good time! Can't wait to try anther dish!"}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and I was suddenly having a craving for Thai. We went in without a reservation and were seated immediately since it was still pretty early. But if you want to go after 730, a reservation is definitely needed. 
I ordered a spicy noodle dish with pork. On a spicy scale 1 to 10, I asked for 10. The dish came out to be spicy, but definitely not a 10. The portion was huge. I had a hard time finishing half of it. I'm not an expert on Thai food so I couldn't really tell if it was authentic. The dish was a little too sweet and greasy for me. But it might be that's the way Thai noodles are supposed to be. 
My friend had a pad Thai combo. It came out with three chicken skews, a yummy creamy soup with shrimps and veges, and two dumplings. I didn't try his pad Thai since I hate peanuts, but the soup was so tasty! There was so much coconut in it, which I love!! Other than that, the skews were dry. The dumplings were plain.
Overall I'm not too impressed with the food. 
The ambience was very nice and cozy though. Loved the exotic decor and service was great!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. My co-workers and I go here a few times a month. The food is generally amazing and the setting and ambiance are both decent for downtown. Also, the prices are reasonable. 

I've had the pad Thai here, it was fairly good. What I loved though was the garlic chicken entree. So amazing! I now get that almost every time I go here. 

If you plan to go here, you'll have a great meal! Just be sure to arrive at around 11:25, otherwise it'll get very busy and you'll be waiting outside. There's a wait for a reason."}
{"text":"I've been to Thailand twice, and my entree here (Pad Thai) was hands down the most authentic, best Thai food I have had since then. The wait staff were also extremely friendly, making for a perfect dining experience."}
{"text":"So glad to have a move accessible  Nicky's around instead of having to go DT when I'm not working. Atmosphere is different from DT but food is just as great. Enough space and parking that there isn't a wait."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars and I gave Nicky's 5 before which I think I'll have to take back. Still love the food here, but I think in the future I may opt for different options Thai options unless I'm already downtown. My most recent time here, I tried the Tiger Cry beef (really tiny portion even for an appetizer), the samosas, the spicy eggplant tofu, red curry, pad Thai, and pad phet beef. Everything was delicious, but Nicky's pad Thai definitely used to be much better. They also used to do a 1-10 scale for spicyness which I preferred much more to the current 1-5 scale. I also had the hot tea that had bourbon in it which was good and pretty well worth the $10 it was since I got about 3 cups of tea out of it. Overall, I think I'd opt for Noodlehead over Nicky's, even though their selection is lower...I just don't think Nicky's is the absolute best anymore."}
{"text":"I actually like this location better than the one in Northside, and it's not just because they have a bar! Went here right before a Pirates game yesterday and were seated immediately without reservations. Service was quick and great. I'm pretty boring so I usually get the pad Thai, it was excellent. Some of the entrees are a little pricey but I think for the quality (and quantity!) of what you get, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and atmosphere. I had the shrimp red chili with a spicy level of 4 and it was delicious. I would definitely get that again."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai was excellent. If you are new to Thai food, give this signature dish a try."}
{"text":"So much better than we thought it would be. Wish they had Larb salad, but everything g we had was delicious and priced well. Also good were the ice-cold Thai beers..."}
{"text":"hot, fresh, very tasty.
not so great for vegetarians - their curries (green, red etc.) come pre-mixed with fish sauce so we couldn't enjoy them.
the basil fried rice was great, as was the noodle dish recommended by our waitress. we arrived just as it opened on sun eve and it filled up in 30mins.  this place is happening, and i can smell why!"}
{"text":"I work around the corner from Nicky's and finally had the time to try lunch. It was very busy even after 1pm. I ordered the Shrimp Red Chili. I chose the salad with sweet pineapple dressing over the soup. Great flavor, fresh salad. Also ordered a Thai Ice Tea. Very unique flavor,  very good though. Got my lunch very quickly for being so busy. Very good dish,  great flavor, not to spicy. Everything cooked perfect. Love the jasmine rice. My only complaint, not enough shrimp for the price. 2 or 3 more would have been worth it. Staff was very friendly. Will be back to try the chicken teriyaki soon."}
{"text":"There are half dozen of good thai restaurants in Pittsburgh area that I can name, but I give Nicky's the best rating. It is small but cozy and clean. The servers are very friendly and know very well about the foods (which sounds odd but some restaurant EEs dont know much about the foods they are serving). I usually go there with a group of friends to share appetizer plate, tom yam soup, main and a dessert. Anything with basil is my personal favorite. it is BYOB."}
{"text":"Was staying in Downtown Pittsburgh and had Nicky's Thai recommended to me. We got the Pad See Ew, Red Curry, and Pumpkin Custard. All were pretty solid! The pad see ew had plenty of broccoli and tofu and could probably have been enough for 2 for dinner. Vegetable Red curry was flavorful and I love that all the vegetables tasted fresh. I wasn't the biggest fan of the pumpkin custard, but it's probably because it tasted more like a sweet bread than a custard to me. I wouldn't call this the best thai food I've ever had, but, the food is good and will satisfy your craving for thai."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have a non-chain near where my parents live and Nicky's was some of the best Thai I've had recently. We ordered a bunch of food and split it all so we could figure out what is hit or miss. The Massaman Curry and Tom Khai Ga were two of the best versions I've ever had and I try every Tom Khai that I can find. The crab rangoon and Pad Thai were both also fantastic. However, the crab fried rice, chicken satay, Thai style dumplings were all just okay. The service was fantastic and our server was incredibly helpful in suggesting and explaining dishes to my mom, who had never had Thai before. 

We got here right at 5pm and I would suggest doing the same or dining at off hours. Looking through the reviews for this place, most of the complaints seem to be around wait time and service. By the time we left at 6:15 the place was packed and there were 10 or so people waiting at the front. They seemed understaffed so I can see where these complaints are valid."}
{"text":"Husband and I enjoyed our visit. Went on a Wednesday around 5ish. There was a good amount of people dining inside and outside at this time, but not crowded. We were seated right away, food came quick. Actually our entrees came before our app but were okay w that. Ordered the Thai iced tea which I've never had before. It was good but a tad too sweet for me. I ordered the tofu hang lay curry, really good! My husband had the pad Thai combo. It included chicken satay, a chicken coconut cabbage soup, two dumplings and the pad Thai. He liked it all. One note: I believe the heat scale is 1-5 not 1-10. My husband ordered 4 and the waiter said NOOO. So he got the 2 and it was just mild heat. He'll try 3 next time. Everything was delicious. Go."}
{"text":"While I absolutely love Nicky and his dishes, which is why I am giving this as many stars as possible (wouldn't want to give anyone the wrong idea), the blond hostess at the Penn Avenue location is terrible.  Very unfriendly and quite snippy when you call in an order and pick one up, she makes me not want to come back.  Looks bad on such a wonderful guy!"}
{"text":"Wow, totally amazing. I'm a believer. Service was great and genuine. Drinks creative, soups the best we've had in Pittsburgh. The vegan duck was superb!.veggie spring rolls perfect, fried rice very tasty. If I had to say anything negative I would  say a bit much oil was used in the fried rice.

We left very content. They accommodated us by putting 2 tables together for our comfort.."}
{"text":"Yum!   This place is on my go to list.   I ordered the shrimp pad thai at a spice level of 6.  It was perfect.  Just the right amount of spice to wake me up, but not so firey that I didn't enjoy it.  My companion ordered some sort of curry with fried fish and pineapple.  He, of course, ordered it Thai spicy (level 10) and enjoyed sweating through the entire dish.  Service was excellent - they kept on top of the water glasses and the food took no time at all.  A winner."}
{"text":"Very respectable Thai food in the heart of the cultural district. Came here on a cold Sunday night so the place wasn't too packed. The table ordered an appetizer sampler, of which I liked the Thai toast the best. Might consider ordering them separately next time. chicken Satay was ok. So was the steamed pork dumpling/shiumai. We also ordered a hot pot style of tom yum soup with shrimp, very good flavor. As for entree I had their red curry with mixed seafood, which consisted of some squid, one scallop, two mussels, 3-ish shrimps. Flavor wise it was rich and delicious. One wouldn't be disappointed. Also had their Thai iced tea, served in glasses a bit on the smaller side. Compared to Thai iced tea elsewhere, I liked that theirs weren't super sweet. Overall the price I thought was reasonable for the location and food. Obviously not super cheap but not gonna break the bank. Would recommend and go again."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Started with a Tom Yum Soup, followed by the Kao Soy (yellow noodle curry).  Service was great.

Not many tables, but worth the risk."}
{"text":"So maybe my expectations are high, but terrible service, slow to arrive food, overly expensive and for the love of all gods, do not get the Thai coffee.  I don't get why this place packed!  The food is ok, not great, and certainly not at the top of the Thai list in the PGH area.  More so certainly not good enough for the subpar service and premium expense.    

Lunch on 6/8, seated at 11:25am, 3 guests, food ordered at 11:30, food arrives at 12:05!  

This my third time at this restaurant and it is consistently bad, plus it made me really sick today within 30 minutes of finishing the meal which is unusual for me."}
{"text":"I have resisted writing a review of Nicky's for a long time since I've tended to view this place as my own for the last 5-6 years. I've only ever recommended it to my closest friends in an attempt to keep the crowds down and to preserve this as a special, hidden gem for only MY use. I've taken friends there to introduce them to the pleasures of a truly great dining experience and EVERY ONE of them has been blown away. Alas, when the Pittsburgh Magazine list of top 25 restaurants included Nicky's, I knew it was over. Now I have to share this place with the great unwashed who haven't grown up with it like I have over the last several years. It pains me. Simply stated, this is WAY better than top 25. It might be top 2 or 3 in Pittsburgh. It's THAT good. But you won't like it so don't bother to go. (Will that keep you away and restore my own private relationship with Nicky's to what it used to be???)

First off, the appearance from Western avenue is not very inviting. You walk into a somewhat decrepit looking building down a hallway to the hostess station. You can see into the kitchen and all the activity and smells that emanate from there are assurance that you've come to the right place and that this is gonna be GOOD! You don't know the half of it. Seating options are inside or out. Outside is a magical garden filled with plants I didn't know could exist on the Northside. How they keep the appearance of an urban jungle is beyond me - but the atmosphere is instantly relaxing and soothing. A host of Thai-related accents, umbrellas over the tables, brick walls - all take you so far away from the Northside you can't even imagine you aren't in Southeast Asia. With a no corkage fee (except on weekends) policy it's one of the best places for BYOB in the city. So bring some wine or champagne and feast your eyes on the menu. Oh my. If you can read through that without needing to wipe the drool from your mouth you need to have somebody check your pulse I've eaten here probably 35 times or more and have sampled so many things - not one of which I didn't rave about or wouldn't order again. The flavors are unlike anything you'll see anywhere else. Thai food is one of my all time favorite cuisines and Nicky's tops the list! And don't associate Thai food with HOT - it isn't unless you want it to be. I always do - on a scale of 1-10 I always order \"Thai Hot\" which is above 10. But the flavors? The curries, noodles, spring rolls, pork/chicken/fish dishes, the soft-shell crabs - all filled with amazing sauces and flavors that you want to savor every bite. My mouth is watering even now as I think about it. Amazing. Plus, if you're a vegetarian, you have a huge selection of entrees that will knock your socks off.

Service is always excellent and attentive. Specials are so tempting and the price is right. I couldn't recommend it more highly. I could eat there several times a week. Wonder if they have a meal plan????"}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Small little quaint neighborhood and a great spot for this restaurant. Very intermittent and the servers are extremely nice. The food comes out hot and is great. I will surely be going back here when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"I'm very picky about my Pad Thai and Nicky's made some good Pad Thai! We also had a green curry with pork. My only complaint was that both the chicken in the Pad Thai and the pork in the curry were sliced thin, fairly dry and tasteless. I would just order it plain next time."}
{"text":"Overall the service was not great but the food was delicious. Waited about 10 minutes to be greeted at the door even with a reservation. The server almost never looked at us and kept walking by without checking on us for. The food, when it did arrive, was actually as good as Thailand quality. Wish they provided more rice with the two curry dishes we ordered. The panang curry was a 10 for me."}
{"text":"I've only gotten take out from this place- which I highly recommend if you plan on going there on a weekend without a reservation. This place gets a big crowd!

There food is great! They use a little more fish sauce than some of the other places around the city. It took me a few bites to get use to. Pad See Ew is really good! Big portions! Super friendly atmosphere! 

Definitely check it out if you like Thai food! Just be aware of the crowd! It's right on Penn surrounded by bars. If there is a wait, you have plenty of options to grab a drink while you wait!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite thai restaurant in Pittsburgh!

There is nothing on their menu I don't like.  Their pad thai with shrimp is EXCELLENT, and they make my favorite curry--mango curry and I always get tofu in it.  The spring rolls are delicious.

Be warned, the spice levels here are high.  If you want just a little kick, don't order higher than a 2.

There are some complaints about the service here, but I have never had any problems."}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite Thai restaurant, if not our favorite spot for dinner in town.  No matter what we order, the food is incredible.  You cannot go wrong.  We really enjoy dining outdoors in the summer, and the cozy indoor dining area in the winter.  Truly a gem!"}
{"text":"Heard it was the best Thai in Pittsburgh, and that is 100% accurate. We've tried many others, but always end up back at Nicky's. Neither of us have ever had anything other than top notch, and I try something new every time. Seating is tight, but I see that more just as the way it is as the food makes the squeeze well worth it. Dining on the back patio is very pleasant when the weather cooperates. The only thing I wish is that they would open another location in the South Hills somewhere. We have three Thai places within 10 minutes, but 5/6 times make fight the traffic into the North Side because it's just worth it."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good Thai food for Downtown Pittsburgh. The spicy Mussels were right on the money and the beer was reasonably priced as well..."}
{"text":"Best thai food in Pittsburgh (tied with Smiling Banana Leaf). A little on the fancier, pricier side but worth it! The green curry and cashew chicken were our go-tos! We have tried the appetizers too- good chicken satay!"}
{"text":"I am a big Thai food lover. This place is definitely high ranking on my list- dare I say best Pad Thai I've had in Pittsburgh? Decor was awesome and the service was great. The silverware is very unique! Loved the authenticity of the place and will definitely be returning again. Spice levels were pretty accurate and the portion sizes were great. Kudos!"}
{"text":"For me the food is just average. I much prefer the Thai Gourmet in Bloomfield."}
{"text":"Horrible management. Don't ever send back food there. My friend was alergic to cashews and had to send her food back. Cashews were not listed on the entree description and when she recieved her modified meal 30 mins later it was still not correct. I don't think they take kindly to corrections and took it out on her meal. It was watery and not spicy. I really think they our dishwater in it. When we spoke to the manager she claimed she would take $10 off and then it didn't show up on the check. When confronted she denied she said she would comp anything. Expecting us to back down I guess. We had to ask for her manager who was no more helpful. Very shady and unplesant. We will not go back."}
{"text":"I always thought that Thai food was only OK prior to coming to Nicky's, but I discovered that I really enjoy it here!  Our group made a reservation on a Friday night, and I think it is probably necessary to do so to get a seat.  There are probably enough seats for 50-75 people total.

I like the ambiance of Nicky's. It is definitely a slightly upscale but still casual feeling. The tables are close together but not claustrophobic feeling.  Service is quick and friendly enough. 

The actual food is quite delicious. My friend and I decided to split the pad Thai ($12.50) at spice 2 and Red Curry ($13.50) at spice 2. I am going to go against what other reviewers say because I thought the spices went mild, personally. I would probably choose to order a 4. The Pad Thai was really delicious with a super portion, but the Red Curry won me over. I have never tried the dish previously, but it was a super interesting mix of tastes in my mouth. Huge fan of the red curry!

Additionally, Nicky's was spot on for the extreme allergies in our group. There was no contamination of gluten, sugar, or meat in the dishes of the people who had dietary restrictions, which is super impressive!

Overall, I really enjoyed Nicky's and would especially recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced dinner before a show in the Cultural District."}
{"text":"What can you say.  Never disappointed but strongly recommend reservations unless you like standing in the small entry.   Great food, fast service and no one wait person.   If you need anything, someone is always ready to assist and or clear plates.   Food is very good and I recommend the Thai beer to complement any dish."}
{"text":"Decent Ambience. Food was pretty okish. Its loud because of tables placed very close to each other. Small flies spotted."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Thai food I have had in Pittsburgh.  
I have been many times to Nicky's.  I love the curries there and I love them hot.  But I definitely learned my lesson the last time I went.  I usually get a number 7 but decided to up it to an 8.  Bad choice.  I couldn't eat more than a few bites.  It was sooo spicy.  There must be a big jump in spice levels between 7 and 8.  
Also, make a reservation!  It is usually packed!  
Bonus: It is BYOB!"}
{"text":"Nicky's is among the best Thai food around, there's no question. The downtown spot is conveniently located near the Cultural District, so it's a great place to grab dinner before a show (and they do take reservations, which I advise that you make if you're doing that).

On our most recent visit, we started with the creamiest crab rangoons of all time, along with a plate of their steamed dumplings. They have a full bar as well, so we got some Pinot Grigio (which for some reason has become my Official Wine of Thai and Sushi). They truly have enough appetizers and small plates on the menu that you could make this a tapas adventure if you wanted to.

For entrees, we both got the spicy noodles (mine with pork, husband's with beef). The noodles are wide but thing, perfectly cooked with napa cabbage (those big chunks of cabbage) in the spicy basil sauce.

And remember: Nicky's is *real* Thai spicy. So what you might be accustomed to ordering as a medium, is actually a mild here. And if you're used to ordering your Thai food 'hot,' well... be prepared to sweat. The first time I went to Nicky's (with my fellow Yelp buddies Linda W. & Rachel C.), we all truly underestimated how spicy the food would be, and spent our entrees crying, sniffling, and saying, 'oh god this is sooooooo goooooood'.

The space is beautiful, although it can feel a bit crowded during the busy times when they're at capacity. They are quite generous with refills on your water (thank goodness, with all that spice!).

However, there's still something that just seems a little disorganized about the service. All of the servers are incredibly polite, friendly, and welcoming. Things just seem to take a little bit longer than we should. At our most recent visit, we were greeted immediately, but prior to us being able to look over the drink menu. So we said, 'Just one minute please,' which turned into almost 10.

Regardless, we'll certainly be back to Nicky's. The food is so flavorful, and the room is so pleasant. We'll just be sure we make our reservations for a little earlier so we have time to enjoy the meal and make our show."}
{"text":"As a long-time fan of the downtown Nicky's, I was so excited to see that a location was opening up literally down the hill from my parents' house. The suburbanites NEED access to delicious non-chain restaurants, and without much or any Thai in the area, I thought this would be perfect.

But it was.... well, one of the most mixed-bags of all the mixed-bags I've ever experienced.

The terrific: 
~ The ambiance. It is BEAUTIFULLY decorated, very ornate and yet somehow cozy. The restroom smells of earthy incense that takes me back to my college dorm room. Even the wood on the tables is pleasant: smooth but rustic and just very calming in general. They have a lovely outdoor seating area that is fitted with those tall heat lamp thingies, so you can enjoy your meal outside even when it's chilly.

~ The food. And let's be honest, this is the number one reason you're going to visit Nicky's. We had the Thai toast, which was that lovely mix of crispy and gooey and hearty. The Tiger Cry Beef was fantastic and not as spicy as the name might imply. And the entrees were a good size, where I didn't feel overwhelmed after a round of small plates, but I also had enough leftover to wrap up for lunch the next day. The soup portions are GIGANTIC, and you can certainly make a meal of small plates and appetizers and be very content.

The okay:
~ The alcohol situation. It is both BYOB and full-service bar. Because of this, the corkage fee is $10 per wine bottle, instead of $5, like their Northside location. And as far as we could tell (at least on the night we recently visited), there was not a dedicated bartender, but servers running back and forth to the bar to grab drinks. It was just strange and a little confusing and not the fastest situation.

And now for,
The really not cool:
~ The service. And it's not why you think!! Our server was as pleasant and friendly and accommodating as could be. However, service was..... slow. Painfully slow. First, they lost our reservation. They fixed that up reasonably quickly, but then no one even came to our table to open our wine bottles or bring water for 25 minutes. I think we just got lost in the shuffle, so we didn't 'belong' to any server. I don't think the server we eventually had was 'supposed to' be ours. When we were there, it just seemed chaotic, like no one was dedicated to running the bar, greeting customers at the door, or waiting tables.  Everyone was SO DANG NICE but they all seemed panicked and disorganized and stressed well beyond their limits. I wanted to be like, 'hey, while we are waiting, show me what I can do to help, give me some plates to deliver.' 

~ The parking. YIKES. I know it's a hot and popular spot right now, but husband had to circle the lot 4-5 times to get a space. They do a lot of takeout business here as well (which was contributing to the staffing confusion it seemed), so the parking lot is full of way more cars than seem to match the capacity of humans inside the building.

I know they are a new restaurant, and I really think that's all it is. They are working out the kinks, getting adjusted to how one deals with a sudden swarm of business. The truth is, they are one of only like 3 sit-down restaurants in the immediate area, and the only one serving Thai food, so I think everyone is rushing in to check it out, and perhaps the management didn't plan for quite such a huge turnout.

The food is excellent, and the servers are sweet as can be, but I think the workflow needs some improvement for this to keep up with the high standard of the other Nicky's. I'm sure we will be back, but I think we will give it a few months for them to get more settled into the flow of traffic. But if you're in the North Hills and not spoiled by having restaurant options all over the place like we cityfolk are, set aside a long block of time and bring a couple of bottles of wine and come on down."}
{"text":"This place lived up to its reputation!! Penang curry with tofu and Tom yum soup is out of this world! Grateful Pittsburgh has this authentic Thai restaurant"}
{"text":"This is one my favorite restaurant in downtown Pittsburgh.  I usually go about once every two weeks during lunch. You MUST go early in order to get a table. 
Pros: the food is reasonable priced which is about $8 for chicken/pork/tofu. There are many dishes that I've tried and really liked. One of them is the sweet and sour dish. I was never a big fan of curry but I enjoy their curry selection. I would recommend the Massaman curry. It's a peanut and coconut base. Most of the meals come with soup or salad. I usually get the soup which is a ginger base with rice and veggies. There is some meat, I think it's pork. The salad is like a summer and light dressing which consists of mango and peanuts.

Cons: the waiting time takes forever during lunch. I dislike the seating arrangements since each table is right next to each other which makes you feel as you are sitting right next to the people on your left and right. I also do not like how loud that place is. If you are meeting friends to catch up, do not go there during lunch. It's hard to hold a conversation when the noise drowns everything out."}
{"text":"I love Nicky 's location in the Northside but I was certain I would love this location. Some restaurants with multiple locations can have something amiss at times, but that definitely was not the case here.

The environment is definitely more upscale appealing than the Western Ave spot.  It's more in line with being in the Cultural District I presume.  They also have a liquor license here unlike the other location.  

We ordered items we would normally get and they definitely were consistent with the other location which was awesome.  Equally as awesome :) 

Service was great too.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"The best Thai in the Burgh.  I was first turned on to Nicky's last summer before I moved back to Pittsburgh and it has become a regular go to for dinner and I always need to bring out of town guests here.  Great food, great service, BYOB (which I love), and beautiful surroundings (love their garden patio in the back).  I will continue to venture to this hidden gem :)  If you have not yet been here, it is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I agree with Jason G. about his review I don't understand the high reviews for this particular Thai restaurant its mediocre Thai food at best and I've had a lot of Thai food. I wanted to like this place a lot but a las its so-so. There isn't a lot of flavour  with any of their curry dishes and they ARE EXTREMELY RUNNY. Maybe its me? Maybe I need to up the spice level a bit? I don't know but I was hardly impressed with either their Yellow Curry or their Pineapple Curry.

 The staff is super friendly though!"}
{"text":"We really liked this place. I had the Massaman Curry and husband had the yellow curry heated up to a 7 on a 3-10 scale. Both dishes were delicious! We also had the crab Rangoon appetizer and that was also very good. Nicky's is located in the Cultural District which was an easy walk from the Omni William Penn hotel where we were staying.  We would totally eat there again if we are ever back in town."}
{"text":"The food was great! The special green curry tuna was really quite nice. The service was HORRIBLE! The waiter was rude, snatched the check from my husbands hand and ignored us most of the time we were here. I even had to yell across the room to get his attention. Would have been a 4 star place but the service flat out sucked!"}
{"text":"Quick and clean thai food! Perfect spot for some great food at a decent price. The waitress was friendly and helpful and our waters never got past the halfway mark. If you like thai, Nicky's thai kitchen is a great spot."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place I found on Yelp when I visited Pittsburgh for work. The outdoor area is so cute and the food was in incredible."}
{"text":"Great spot. Appetizer sampler and Pork Belly Buns. Tied the boat up at Convention Center. Joy at the bar was truly delightful."}
{"text":"Best seafood Tom yam and dumplings! Stuff is good too, always keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"The outside dining area is pleasant and clean. Although our waitress wasn't the greatest the rest of the wait staff took great care of us. The food is amazingly clean and fresh. I have also eaten at the downtown location and that too I highly recommend. We got the appetizer platter and covered all the bases and then got shrimp pad Thai as a 2.5 on the spicy scale and it was perfect. I wouldn't go much hotter for my first time. It is BYOB so be prepared."}
{"text":"We went to Nicky's for a Saturday afternoon lunch before heading to Homemade Arcade. It was very busy. We were deceived by being seated so quickly...our actual meal took FOREVER once we got to the table. Our waitress was very sweet, but seemed new and not able to answer some questions we had about prices or certain menu items. If you don't know, that's fine, but maybe offer to go ask someone who does instead of just guessing and leaving us no more informed than before! She took our drink order, brought them out and then left us to decide on our meals. I have no idea where she went because it was a REALLY long time before she came back over!

When the food finally came out, it was just ok. We ordered Crab Rangoon as an appetizer and while the flavor was there, the shells were completely soggy which was a huge disappointment. The other server who brought out our food apologized for the delay and thanked us for waiting. I ordered a dish with thin rice noodles, shrimp and veggies in a garlic sauce. It was average. The shrimp wasn't very flavorful and seemed to be thrown on top of the platter rather than seasoned and cooked with it. My boyfriend ordered soft shelled crab and again, the flavor was there but it was another soggy disappointment. 

Two dishes that went over well were the green curry and a tofu stir-fry with wide rice noodles and a dark soy sauce. Each order came with thr option of a salad with pineapple dressing or chicken noodle soup. The salad was ok. I had a bite of my friend's soup ans would have preferred that. 

It was reasonably priced for lunch, it came to about $15 per person. We got a good portion of food for a god price, so I'd probably give it another try."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Nicky's Thai on the North Side, although I have been to the downtown location many, many times. The inside seating area is a little smaller, although I believe they have outdoor seating at this location. The food was great, service was great, and ambiance was great -- just as I expected it would be! I ordered the green curry noodle dish (which I've had numerous times at different Thai restaurants) and it was delicious here! I was happy the server gave me the warning that all curry dishes are rated around a 3 to begin with because of the spice in the sauce. I'm a little bit of a baby with spicy food, but I went for it and it was just spicy enough for me.

This location, unlike downtown, is a BYOB. Always a plus!"}
{"text":"Pretty much your typical Americanized Thai restaurant with a fairly lengthy menu and the typical fare of popular curries, stir fries, soups, and salads.  While nothing I tried here was mindblowing or very original, it would be unfair to say it didn't hit the spot for my (perpetual) Thai craving.

Nicky's was packed both with clientele and narrow-aisled rows of tables on a Saturday night.  Despite how busy it was, service was quick and attentive for our party of 5.  Our server spent quite a bit of time answering our questions about spiciness levels and whatnot and was super patient with us, despite probably having heard our same requests thousands of times.  My jasmine tea was lovely.  Our food came out surprisingly quickly at all, first my VEGETABLE TOM YUM SOUP, and then my BROCCOLI entree and my fiance's BEEF PAD PHET entree.

My soup was packed with veggies, which was great, but lacked a depth of flavor that I usually take for granted in typically in this pleasantly super sour and umami dish.  My broccoli stir fry, however, was wonderfully seasoned and slightly sweet, and I regret absolutely nothing about it.  My fiance's stir fry was much more one-noted as mine.  Not untasty, but just not that exciting either.  I also tried a bite of my friend's GREEN CURRY, which was coconutty and sweet but fell a bit flat otherwise as well.  Having spent a year living in Thailand and as a lover of the cuisine, she was not impressed.

The biggest disappointment, however, was that nothing was as spicy as we wanted it to be.  Our server had tried to talk our table of chili heads out of ordering anything higher than a 7, but my soup at an 8 had nothing spicy going for it besides a few chili flakes on top, and my entree was more sweet than anything else.  The pad phet was the only dish that turned out slightly spicy, but we considered it much more of a 6 or 7 than the 10 we had ordered.  We ended up asking for the condiment caddy to take matters into our own hands, which vastly improved the matter.  I feel like the condiments would find a welcome home on every table to begin with.  When she gave us the check, our server told us they have a spice level 20...would have been good to know.  It's totes understandable that spiciness levels are completely subjective and hard to gauge or recommend, but if you get customers asking for fire, don't hold back.

So long story short, Nicky's suffers from the typical popular Americanized Thai restaurant ailment--lots of potential, but it doesn't dare to be Thai enough.  Please, bring on the heat and the fish sauce.  Some, if maybe not all, customers are ready and willing.  Besides that, everything I ate was totally satisfactory and I would order it again--if I came back, that is.  But with Smiling Banana Leaf being much less afraid to drop umami bombs, I'm not sure if that will happen anytime soon.

And a tip for the proprietors: update your online menu!  It's missing an entire vegetarian section and a bunch of awesome sounding dishes.  Please and thanks."}
{"text":"Best Thai in town. There is a reason they are always crowded, but the wait is short and worth it. Be sure to explore the menu. Lunch time specials are a great deal."}
{"text":"Great service! My water glass was never empty. Friendly staff and delicious lunch. A must when downtown."}
{"text":"I am absolutely thrilled by this edition to downtown.   The Penn Avenue area was in desperate need of some more restaurants and I'm even happier that it was a Thai restaurant and is providing some food variety.   Apparently everyone else in Pittsburgh is just as excited as I am because I can't manage to find a time during the lunch hour when there isn't a wait!   I've gone at 11:30, noon and 12:30 and stood in line every time.   I guess there are worse problems to have though!

Every time I've gone here (except my first visit), I've gotten the spicy noodles.   I almost tried something new the last time but then I asked the waiter which of the two options he recommended and he said spicy noodles, so my consistent choice now feels validated.  I will warn you that the spicy noodles are very spicy.   There are some dishes here, where you can order an 8 or 9 and say, eh that wasn't too spicy but the spicy noodles isn't one of them.  I'd stick with a 6 or 7 the first time (assuming you like some heat).   You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nicky's Thai Kitchen has been on my bookmarks for a really long time and I was glad to finally come here. We had a reservation for 8pm on a busy Saturday night. It took us much longer than expected to find parking, so we ended up reaching at 8.16pm. By then, our table was given to someone else. So, we had to wait for an additional 20 minutes before we were seated. The ambience is really nice, with Thai artwork decorating the floor and the walls. 

For the appetizer, we shared a Mango salad (spice level 7). The sweet mangoes complimented the spicy sauce very well. However, the sauce had a fishy aroma to it, which I did not appreciate too much. I was expecting the salad to leave a fresh feeling, but instead was left with a fishy feeling. 

I got a pad see ew, which is my favorite Thai item. Really liked it. The flat noodles were really soft and juicy. My wife had gotten the tofu Llad Nah, which she found too watery."}
{"text":"Nicky's is good Thai food. Not a BS restaurant. They do a very good job. Best Thai in Pittsburgh IMHO. Go here, be happy."}
{"text":"Horrible experience here tonight.  We were asked to leave so that someone else could have our table.  This was very rude, especailly when there was another group who had been finished linger than us.  And yes, we tip very well."}
{"text":"Nicky's Thai Kitchen is a beautiful dining experience tucked away in the middle of downtown. I might spend as much time staring at the golden mirrored ornamental designs around me as I do the menu or talking with my friends, which is not to say that the quality of the food is anything less.

I am always impressed by their wide selection of curries, noodles, and appetizers. My favorite dish so far is the panang curry - the notes of lime, basil, and cilantro are soothing and comforting, the right mix of sweet and savory, perfect with a side of rice. Their appetizers are delicious as well - I recommend the deep-fried shrimp cakes which go well with the accompanying light cucumber sauce. 

Just writing this review makes me want to go back when I get the chance to have the same exact thing as last time even though there's so many things on the menu I promise myself I'll try next time."}
{"text":"OMG. This place is amazing!! We sat outside on the patio even though it was a bit cold. My husband whined about it like a baby- but I thought it was fine since they had heaters near the tables (my husband sat closest to the heater btw.)  The service was prompt, helpful and friendly.  I got the Koa Soy and it was out of this world.  It was a little more like a soup than I expected (although not quite a soup either.)  I highly recommend it.  
I got the sticky rice with custard.  It was very good (although not as good as Pusadee's)

Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Make Nicky's Thai a stop if you like Thai food. I've never had a bad meal or inconsistent flavors. It's always spot-on. The soups are delicious; I prefer the coconut based over the sweet and sour base. The servers are excellent, the atmosphere is quaint and the prices are great."}
{"text":"So glad I trusted other reviews and came here. Ben was very friendly and attentive without being overbearing. The food come out really fast and was absolutely delicious. I had the Pad See Eaw which I've had at many Thai restaurants and is my staple at Thai Taste in Charlotte. It was on par with Thai Taste which is saying something. We also had the spring rolls which were okay in flavor, but a bit dry. I give them a pass on this as I honestly feel like they maybe weren't prepared fresh as the rice paper seemed a bit dehydrated. This could be because we were in not too long before close. 

Overall, great service and a great experience. We will be back next time we are in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Cozy little Thai place on the North Side, Nicky's Thai is number one in Pittsburgh for unbeatable Thai fare. Nicky's Thai has unique offerings that other Thai wannabes do not offer."}
{"text":"Still absolutely delicious. I finally had the chance to dine in. When I worked downtown, I often offered nickys for take out lunch. It was great then, but im glad that I finally dined in.

Service was great. We had one main server, but others were also on top of checking up on us. I'm pretty sure a person had a job of constantly refilling water. It was appreciated lol

I ordered pineapple curry with chicken. It was not my first time trying this dish at Nickys, however, the gold dish it served in is much better than a take out dish.

My boyfriend ordered duck curry. He loved it.

Spice level is 1-10 which could either make it easier or more difficult to determine your spice level.

Great meal here as always. Dining room has my h more space than the north side location. The decor inside was nice also.

Nickys is the best and I've tried many nice Thai places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This was perhaps the best Thai food I've ever had. This is a small restaurant so we called ahead for a table of 10 which took up half the place. Big, golden statues adorned the window area and our food was served in tall, golden goblets. Nicky's gets and A+ for presentation and it only helps that the food is stellar. My yellow curry tofu was about $14 but the portions are extremely generous."}
{"text":"I've been to 4 or 5 Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh over the years. Nicky's is the best. I have yet to eat a bad meal here. The outdoor patio is beautiful in the summer. It's byob so stop by the liquor store on your way over!"}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan. I gave four stars instead of three for one reason: Chicken Garprow Lad Kao. You can get it with other meats but im telling you, it's amazing. Spicy, basily, with a fried egg on top. The curries ive had here have never been consistent. Sometimes theyre good other times my meat was rubbery. The thai toasts are a great appetizer, and the lunch specials are a good deal."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant for dinner on a week night. I had no reservation but was able to get a small table. I ordered the samosa, crab rangoon, green curry chicken, and Thai iced tea. All of the food tasted good. I liked that the food differed a little from other Thai restaurants that I have visited. The service was good."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best Thai in the city.

I've been ordering Take-Out at Nicky's for the better part of year. To put into perspective how i feel about the food, consider i drive 6.4 miles out of my way each time to snag the Pad Thai.

The price and quality make Nicky's special. For under $20 you are treated to a large portion of perfectly seasoned and spicy noodles, sprouts, and chicken. The spice level ranges from 1-10, which really allows each person to tailor the dish to what suits them. The more you go back, the better understanding you get of the spice levels.

Overall i could not be more pleased with all facets of Nicky's truly a treat each time i order."}
{"text":"I've been back multiple times over the past few years and have never been disappointed. They are always packed and have a cute outdoor space in the back."}
{"text":"I just had the red curry and it was hands down the best red curry I've ever had. It was sweet and not too spicy. I ordered a 7 as the spice factor. Was hoping it would be hotter, but I ended up asking for more spices on the side. One of them made the dish spicier and even better! Happy I went. Give it a try if you like thai!"}
{"text":"I tried the Thai style fried rice and there were not bad. Two days after I tried the red curry and I must say that it was awesome! I guess they make good curries than rice. The rice quality was better than other asian restaurants."}
{"text":"It's been so long that I had amazing Thai food. This place has it all. The traditional items that you'd expect and then some very interesting creations. Small and a little cramped but so yummy. I wished they open another open over in Jefferson Hills."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Get the pad see yew. So good. Salty and delicious. It is definitely my go to place to thai food. Probably the best in the city albeit I've only gone to 2 others. 

The ambiance is nice and the decorations are pretty cool too. You'll notice that if you don't get there at 11:30 you will have a tough time waiting for a seat. This place gets packed every day so either arrive early or expect to eat a late lunch. The prices are fair although a little expensive. They have a lunch menu too. 

This is definitely a once a week kinda place and if your in the mood for thai food definitely check this place out first."}
{"text":"NY'er trying to find thai in Pittsburgh came across Nicky's Thai.  Curry sauces had too much brocolli and red peppers.... Curry sauce very thin and too much coconut milk.   Had the chef duck special and was very salty .  On a brighter note pad thai and thai ice tea was good.  conclusion this is not authentic thai!"}
{"text":"Very interesting setting, especially if the weather allows seating in the back outdoor garden.  As close as one is going to get to the tropics in Pittsburgh.    The food is quite good with many familiar dishes.  I'd give this place a slight edge over the location on Penn avenue which is more crowded."}
{"text":"I wish I had realized that Nicky's has a lunch version of their menu sooner, because we find it quite sufficient as compared to the full menu. Since it's still pretty extensive but with lower prices overall (plus a soup or salad with most items), there's no reason not to! We chose the rice soup to start with, and it was so hearty, being seasoned with some herbs and spices and some pieces of meat. Our entrees were the phad see eaw and wild curry. The former was made just as well as you can find in many other Thai restaurants. The wild curry came with an assortment of different vegetables; it was interesting because it lacked coconut milk and was more like a spicy soup. They also came with a crab rangoon each, which I found kind of weird, but it was an interesting bonus. The food here tends to be on the sweeter side, so that's something to keep in mind."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend who lives in the Cultural District in Pittsburgh, and she made reservations at Nicky's Thai Restaurant for Dinner. It was a Friday night, so the restaurant was busy but we were seated promptly at our reservation time. We started with the crab rangoon, spring rolls and dumplings. All were good but the crab rangoon could have been the best I have ever eaten. We each got our own entrees, I had the Salmon Mango Curry - Grilled salmon, slice fresh mango, pea carrot stir-fried mix vegetable basil leaves, topped with green curry sauce. It was very delicious. I tried to save room for dessert but ate the whole thing. My friend had the pumpkin curry and would recommend that dish as well. Nicky's is BYOB, which made the evening even more pleasurable. 

Definitely give Nicky's a try when in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"It looks like a popular place for lunch because by 12pm the place was full and we saw people waiting for the table. 
But food wise it was very mediocre Thai locking any flavor but spiciness. Ambiance was beautiful, but the noise level was just deafening. Though the service was efficient and nice we are not planing to come back."}
{"text":"Nicky's, one of the staple Thai restaurants that is on everyone's top list of restaurants, has finally moved into their newest space - much to the joy of disinterested downtown diners who were sick of lackluster lunch locations. I had the joy of Nicky's Thai at being only a short walk away, back when I worked on the other side of the river. Now being nowhere near, I would constantly crave food as flavorful and spicy as my old lunch haunt. And It appears I'm not the only one to take notice, the Downtown Nicky's is expectedly packed during the lunch rush - being pretty difficult to get a table between 12:00 and 12:45.

Entering Nicky's, the space is comfortably decorated, but larger and less cozy than the North shore location. As far as I can tell, gone is the beautifully decorated patio which made the atmosphere really shine, I can only detect interior seating here(though I will update if I find out differently). The waiting area upon entering is narrow and sectioned off by some shelves - too small for a party to wait, and barely large enough to wait for your takeout to be brought to the front. This is probably the largest complaint of the place - The second group to arrive and wait for a table will inevitably be waiting between seated people as they dine.

The restaurant is currently BYO if you care for it, though I expect many lunchers can't take full advantage of that option. Dinner-goers, though, will certainly find a downtown BYOB spot nice - but should utilize it while they can.. A full bar is being planned and the fate of BYO is dubious. N/A drinks are standard fare for a thai place - hot tea, coconut water, thai iced tea. The cost here is reasonable, and depends on what protein you select. For lunch, veggie entrees are usually around $8, pork/chicken for $9, beef for $10, shrimp for $11 and mixed seafood for $12. 

The menu is quite large,  larger than I remembered at the north shore location. It comes on a two-sided flat board which is grouped into sections like 'Curries', 'Rice', 'Noodles', 'Soup', 'Chef Specialties'. It's difficult to go wrong on the menu, but ordering Thai(or any ethnic cuisine) can be difficult for people, so some of my favorite items are the Green Curry, Red Chili Shrimp, Pad See Eaw, and Spicy Noodles. There are appetizers on the menu, but be aware that each entree comes with a soup(usually chicken and rice) or salad, and a single crab rangoon off to the side. Spiciness is usually requested on the classic scale of 1-10, but I have recently been experimenting with \"Mild/Medium/Hot/Thai Hot\" for a more consistent experience. I always go with 10 or Thai Hot, and unlike the unfortunate Smiling Banana Leaf, Nicky's is not afraid to deliver - It is not for the faint of heart or delicate of palate.

 The food is really where Nicky's shines. Fresh and flavorful veggies that are crisp and not mushy, proteins that are full of flavor and cooked to tenderness, and sauces that burst with flavors full of spices and herbs, sweetness and spiciness. Garlic chilies, coconut, ginger, thai basil, and countless other flavors permeate every bite, making each subsequent taste both irresistible and enthralling.

I have gotten takeout here a few times with perfect accuracy(8 entrees with correctly labeled spice levels, protein choices, substitutions/omissions, and soup/salad choices) - but it appears that my penchant for spice may have kicked up everyone else's choices a bit by proxy. Be aware if you're going to order a 10/Thai hot dish to potentially order everyone else's dish a step milder than normal.

In my opinion, if you enjoy ethnic foods, you've found the best dining option in the downtown area. Look no further.

I'm surprised to see so many reviews scolding Nicky's for service before they even get a month under their belt. Initially you could tell they were understaffed at the lunch hour - but I would expect nothing less from a brand new restaurant, especially in a difficult-to-plan downtown lunch area. There now appear to be more servers and the last time I came into the restaurant around 12:50 there were plenty of open tables - so I'll assume they've been fitting meals into a standard lunch hour."}
{"text":"Best. Thai. EVER.

This small, neighborhood delight is unassuming at first glance. Make no mistake about it, those chefs in the kitchen you see upon first walking into Nicky's are hard at work, creating not only the best Thai food in Pittsburgh, but perhaps anywhere. The dining room is small but nice enough, but the real treat occurs when the weather is nicer and you move your dining experience to the patio. Beautiful foliage, babbling fountains, subtle twinkling lights, glass top tables with protective umbrellas...it's what I imagine dining in a secret garden would be like if Buddah was watching. And then, your food arrives.

The spring rolls are light, tasty, with just a hint of crunchy peanuts. They are served with an amazing sweet dipping sauce. The samosa are incredible, lightly fried, and in addition to the traditional fillings such as potatoes, peas and carrots, they have added a very welcome layer of...pumpkin. Any samosa I've had since trying these treasures has fallen way short. Now, I'm the kind of girl who orders Pad Thai pretty much everywhere I go. I can't seem to stop myself. Nicky's Pad Thai is in a whole different league. The plate that is presented to you is vibrant, fresh, the tofu is always perfectly cooked, beautifully sauced, and the portions are definitely enough to provide lunch the following day. After trying the Pad Thai, it took me probably 5 visits to Nicky's to finally branch out and try something else on their ample, tasty menu. Other standout dishes for me? Definitely the yellow curry, the spicy noodle dish (rice noodles, cabbage and a yummy spicy basil sauce), the kao soy (yellow curry remix with rice noodles, pickled cabbage, tofu. My new go-to dish). 

There is another Nicky's location in Verona, and we have gotten take out from here on a few occasions. The menu is the same. The quality and consistency of the food, however, is not. It's decent Thai food, but certainly not what I've come to expect when I think of the extraordinary flavors of Nicky's.

This is a special, wonderful restaurant. The service I have had here has always been nothing short of stellar. I will continue to frequent here and hope that they continue to be successful. I just hope with all the new people that discover this North Side gem, there continues to be a table on the patio for me."}
{"text":"food was ok.  satay was not fully grilled and was spiced for American taste   (not authentic)

when we asked to grill the satay longer the waiter was happy to do so but brought back the same food, charred, and with the skewers burned which gave the meat a charcoal feel and taste

Suggestion:  when something is off clearly, remake and comp the item for goodwill

vegetables and beef quality were poor   
you could see the color and texture were off before tasting

pineapple fried rice was good however"}
{"text":"I could not love Nicky's more than I do. It is always wonderful quality and perfect spicing. This location is very nice inside, but I do love the North Side's porch. During the winter months, I prefer this location since it is a little roomier though."}
{"text":"The absolute best Thai! I'm obsessed with this place and go any time that I can. There are no bad dishes. The tables are very close together and small, but for the food it's worth it"}
{"text":"Truthfully, the food is excellent. Service is hit or miss. We've had excellent servers and some so so. They accept but do not honor reservations. We were not seated 20 minutes after our reservation and walk-ins were being seated before us (I know they were walk-ins because I asked them if they had reservations and they said no). The hostess then tried to tell me the couple did have reservations and that's why they were seated first... I'm normally pretty patient, but the lobby/stairwell we stood in for 25+ min smelled like fecal matter."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place.  Good thai food in a downtown location and reasonable priced.  Even considered dining here two days in a row.  I have had better Thai food but it was great to have good food near the convention center that was quite a nice break from what I typically associate with convention centers, a sea of chain restaurants.  The basil chicken and red curry noodle were good.  They have plenty of classic thai dishes and large portion sizes!  Price point was very reasonable at 10-15$ for most dinner entrees.  They take reservations.  Weekend parking at Ninth and Penn garage is only 6$ per day."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in the city! Someone who is from Thailand recommended this restaurant, and I wanted to visit it from so long. We went there to celebrate a friend's birthday and boy, we were all pleased.

First of all the ambiance of this place is great! They have these golden sculptures, and sort of bronze bells hung all around. Transported me back to the feel of a Buddhist monastery! The place seemed rather busy even for a weekday evening. Reservations are probably a must for weekends. The service was great, the waiter was extremely courteous.

I can't even get started on the food! There are so many options, that we took a lot of time to decide. For appetizers, we ordered the Chicken Wings (with basil sauce). It was incredible. What we loved was that it came with a lots of side salad, and had a nice flavor to it. We were curious about the samosas in a Thai restaurant so we ordered it. It was basically sweet potato samosas, and tasted sweet and really unique. We also ordered the Thai iced tea, nothing phenomenal there, but decent enough.

For the entrees, we ordered the green curry and trust me, this is  the best curry I have ever eaten :) I loved the way they presented the food in golden colored cutlery :) We had the Garprow Chicken Lad Kao, which is basically an egg, minced and flavored chicken over a bed of rice. 

Overall, I am definitely coming here again and recommending the place to friends."}
{"text":"Not the best Thai food I've had but pretty decent. Food was yummy and we loved their Thai tea. Good for group. A little bit crowded tho."}
{"text":"Best THAI food I've ever had. Prices were reasonable, service was excellent, ambience was wonderful!! We had mussels, fried tofu in peanut sauce, Tom kha soup, and pumpkin curry...it was all to die for! Many gluten free choices and the wait staff were very helpful. I will only be in town a week, but can be sure I will return."}
{"text":"I gave this place a second chance and I am glad that I did. I went with a large group for lunch and the food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I ordered Nicky's Thai Kitchen through Door Dash due to great reviews. Unfortunately, my experience was just so-so. The Pad Thai was horrendous. There was absolutely no flavor, the noodles were dry, and the pork was tough. 

Luckily, the green curry stepped in to save the day. The green curry was savory and creamy, with the perfect explosion of flavor. The curry was almost good enough to make me forget the Pad Thai. 

Given this experience,  I wouldn't rush back, but I'd be willing to give this restaurant another try."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time to meet up with college friends. We made a reservation and we're seated quickly. 

I'll be honest. I was disappointed with my service. My waiter was Putu and he seemed unable to handle the crowded restaurant. My friend ordered first for appetizers and he forgot to put hers in as well as give me the chopsticks I asked for. I had to call him over to get them and have him put in her order. The same friend ordered pad Thai and it came after the rest of the table and the egg rolls came after that. 

The food it's self was ok. My chicken was over cooked so it was a little dry but the curry was good. There was only one small bowl of rice for two people to share. It was really enough for one person if they wanted to use the curry over rice. To get more you had to pay extra. 

When it came time for the bill. Putu only took some of the bills and after waiting for a long time we had to call him back to get the rest. We had a party of 5 and they automatically included gratuity. I'm not usually a fan of that for this very reason. We received very poor service and he received a full tip. 

Next time, I would probably order take out or go to the one on the Northside."}
{"text":"Excellent on all levels. 

Best Thai in the City w 2 locations. Downtown on Penn Ave is great for city dwellers and visitors. Thus location can get very busy, so of its a Wednesday -Saturday evening, call ahead for rsvp. 

Food quality is on par. Best ingredients for Thai recipes from Curry to Hot Pepper Flakes to coconut. Sometimes the specials are out of this world. Def try the Pumpkin Curry dishes. Seafood is always fresh tasting. 

Great for groups, date night, sitting solo at the back bar...Restaurant can get loud so acoustics are a bit annoying on very busy evenings. 

Good comes out quickly so order in a timely manner to get to enjoy everything.  Also, there is a lot of food in a plating so sometimes splitting a meal is a good option if you are not too hungry or have a smaller appetite.  

Pad Thai and Fresh Spring Rolls are quite popular. Tom Ka Soup is excellent. Get it as a hot pot!

Fun dining and great food, can't go wrong if your a Thai connoisseur or a novice. Encourage friends to try if they haven't been."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food, but sometimes the service and the pace are extremely slow. Don't go to eat here when it is busy. It just gets way too noisy and starts to suffer in quality."}
{"text":"Wow!  Great food, diligent service, good atmosphere.  Watch the curries if you aren't accustomed to spicy Thai, server said base line is 3 on a scale of 10, and she wasn't kidding.  Yummy stuff."}
{"text":"Got their lunch special and it was delicious! I ordered the Pad Se Ew and asked what the spice levels were, the lady on the phone said it went up to 10, so I ordered a 5. When I got to the restaurant to pick up and she confirmed my order, she said the top spice level was actually a 5. I was a little nervous my food was going to be too hot. 

When I sat down to eat it, I forgot I even asked for spice and didn't taste anything. Besides that blunder, the food was really good!!"}
{"text":"what happened to the real thai spice level? the only thing they offer now to spice up the food is red pepper flakes or pickled thai peppers which don't offer much eat and are off-putting if too many are used. Bring back the fresh peppers and the /10 spice level. I'm so, so disappointed."}
{"text":"I was traveling on business to Pittsburgh and came across this place in downtown. Awesome food. Ordered food at 8 (out of 10) spice level and it was super spicy (and I liked it that way). The tofu eggplant entre was delicious and so was the tom yum soup. The place was quite empty on a late weeknight and the service was great as well. I recommend the place."}
{"text":"After reading a number of positive online reviews of the original Nicky's location, I had somewhat high hopes about this newer location (despite several disappointing visits to other Thai restaurants in this area already). Unfortunately, both the food and the experience fell short of that expectation.

Perhaps it was because we visited at an especially busy time (i.e. the weekend pre-show dinner hour), but we were given a table after a relatively long wait - under the condition that we free up the table within an hour. Really? I've never heard that before. Ever. Maybe that's a more common practice in restaurant culture than my personal experience shows, but it truly baffles me that efficient \"table-turning\" is predicated on customers watching the clock during their meal rather than a prompt/competent wait staff. Isn't giving guests a relaxing, enjoyable experience the whole essence of a restaurant? Maybe I'm asking for too much here.

As for the food itself, the Pad Thai was overly sweet, which only became more and more prominent with each successive bite. One of the friends I was with said her curry left much to be desired as well. Also, pro tip: providing more thorough lists of each dish's primary ingredients on the menu can ensure that fewer things get sent back to the kitchen due to food sensitivities/allergies.

It's a shame, really; this is a great location with a ton of potential, but location and convenience alone can't save lackluster food or service. Well, at least the decor was nice, right?"}
{"text":"Went to this place on a whim for lunch. Great food and service. \"Spicy\" is hard to find around Pitt but this place delivered. I had the pumpkin curry with chicken, friend had a beef dish. Both were outstanding."}
{"text":"Fantastic little restaurant tucked away in a cosy North Side neighborhood.  I had the dumplings and Massaman curry.  The curry was very balanced, exhibiting a richness and hint of peanuts but not overpowering.  Perhaps its years of eating spicy Indian cuisine but the only major complaint I had is the lack of heat in the food, which has been highlighted by previous Yelpers.  

If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again I'll definitely make the trip to stop here."}
{"text":"Loved it!!!! Really I don't want to say more. It's always busy apparently, but rightfully so."}
{"text":"What a fantastic time I had at Nicky's Thai Kitchen during my first experience with Thai food! Now, going into this I was pretty excited yet nervous to try Thai food. I had heard nothing but great things about it, but what makes me so nervous was the heat factor. Anyone who knows me, will tell you I'm a huge baby when it comes to spicy and hot foods. On the other hand, my girlfriend enjoys eating spicy foods. Leave it up to her to sike me out about how hot the food might be.

Upon arrival, we walked in and headed up the stairs to a somewhat dim dining room. Did not bother me much at all because we had just come from Lefty's (local bar nearby) where we had 2 very Strong Islands! So needless to say, nothing bothered me about the lighting, but for some maybe too dark. We were then meet by our kind server, who was nice. 

My first time being at a Thai food spot, I wasn't sure what I would like and maybe wouldn't like. I was actually able to come to a pretty quick decision when I saw the Pumpkin Curry Chicken! I'll be damned, how good that turned out to be! Now I was a bit nervous because I was preparing myself to tell the waiter how not hot I wanted my food haha. It was painless, my GF got a 3, and I ended up getting a 1. I just thought folks would maybe judge me because I was getting a 1, I know right, how silly of me to think that. 

All was well when the food hit the table. The pumpkin curry came with 3 chicken thighs, the curry and white rice. Also had some peanuts tossed on top for texture. Unreal good! I am also very happy with my visit because other than my girlfriends curry, this has to be the best curry I've had! The chicken was cooked wonderfully, and the flavor of the pumpkin curry was unlike anything I've had. A tasty dish indeed! I would recommend Nicky's Thai Kitchen! Even if you are like me and not too big on spicy food, you can still come here and enjoy your Thai food. No worries about how spicy things can get, if I can take a 1, anyone can handle it. Great place to come get stellar food!"}
{"text":"This is my go to favorite Thai restaurant! All the food here is amazing. 
Recently I went and ordered the spicy peanut stir fry entree! It was delicious as usual! I got a 3 out of 5 spiciness level and that was perfect for my taste buds. 
My only minor complaint would be is that the chicken could be softer. It was a little bit hard but nonetheless still very good.
I would recommend calling ahead for a reservation as it can be packed especially on a weekend.
Service is mediocre, I have had experience where it was very good and experience where it wasn't that great but it really depends on how packed the restaurant goes.
I would highly recommend Nicky's for Thai out of all Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"Samosas were not the traditional samosa. They were tasty but quite greasy. The chicken rice soup was delicious. The green chicken curry was very tasty and I enjoyed all the vegetables, but the chicken was tough."}
{"text":"So this is the second time I tried Thai food and I loved it! Way better then my first experience.

First of all we called and got reservations. I highly recommend it and ask to sit on the patio weather permitting. 

When we got there the place had an old home feel to it. The staircase and thick wood rail were very unique. After we got waited on we were sent back to the patio. This patio was amazing it felt like you were whisked away to another world. Even though right through the dense is the road like a little slice of paradise. Place filled with fixtures and statues. The fountains and waterfalls give it a nice touch. 

We were seated we were quickly given water and explored the menus. So to start we got the chef special spicy  mussels. They were delicious but bordering on my tolerance for spice level. For my main course I got the mix seafood grill pad Tai since I was familiar with it. It was AMAZING! It had a nice flavor with right amount of spice for me ( I got level 3 ). The seafood was not scarce either. It had mussels, squid, shrimp, crab, and scallops. There was not a bite that didn't have seafood in it.

My date got the SeaBass which he absolutely adored. I had a bite of it and the kefir lime gave the dish a lovely citrus taste. 
I found everything about this place intriguing and can't wait to try it out again. The dishes I saw come out of the kitchen all looked so yummy!"}
{"text":"Heard this was voted the best Thai in Pittsburgh so I had to come check it out. It definitely lived up to that name! I ended up coming twice in about a month. I got the sweet and sour tofu the first time and the broccoli with tofu the second time. I had a very nice waitress that had a list of everything on the menu that was vegan and she was very helpful. My family that is not vegan also really enjoyed their meals. I'll definitely be coming back to try more items that are vegan on the menu!"}
{"text":"Finally standard Americanized Thai food. Process are high but the food is ok. Won't be going back but I wouldn't tell you not to check it out"}
{"text":"The crab rangoons were the best I've ever had. Hands down. The pineapple chicken curry was very good, but not spicy at all and I asked for medium. Still good, but if you want it spicy you have to ask for five on a one to five scale - my colleague ordered his a four and said it wasn't spicy either."}
{"text":"For Thai food in Pittsburgh this is the place to go! Good food. Love the curries. Get the fried banana and coconut for dessert you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Awesome food- true to its spice level ... Great ambience (even the restrooms had beautiful fragrance) Superb service... 
Love it :)"}
{"text":"Typical Thai food, with pretty creative selection for curry. We got the spring rolls, pork pad thai, Thai fried rice, pineapple curry, and duck noodle soup. I loved the curry and the spring rolls best!
For seating, make sure to request outdoors if weather permits, otherwise inside seating can get quite stuffy if it's a hot day."}
{"text":"Did not think it could be louder than Western Ave. I was wrong.   Food is still great and getting used to the new 1-5 hot from the old 1-10."}
{"text":"We got Nicky's to go.  It came highly recommended to me by others, and I will pass along the good word.  I love it - I got the pumpkin curry, crab rangoon, and tom kha soup.  The pumpkin curry was really good - a bit on the spicy side for a '3', but I'll know that for next time.  These spice levels are all relative to the chef anyhow.  The crab rangoon was probably some of the best I've had - not too fried, not overly creamy - just right. The ONLY complaint I'd have is the tom kha was super sweet and super rich (probably the 'worst' I've had in Pittsburgh...but by NO means was it bad.)  It had good flavor otherwise, so the super sweet coconut milk won't prevent me from getting it, but I'll make sure I have a bit of chicken broth around to water it down a bit.  Of course, that will only work when I get it to go.  I likely won't order if it we are dining there."}
{"text":"NIcky's is a great place to go on a date. The food is amazing. The manager is flexible and gregarious. The setting is loud, but that's totally fine. I don't mind.

We were a group of eleven. Speaking of Eleven, that restaurant on Smallman Street looks totally pretentious. Don't go there. Come to Nicky's!

I ordered the green mango curry tofu dish. We also got vegetarian dumplings, a hotpot of Tom Yum soup, and I tried the spicy green bean tofu. My green curry was on point as expected. Green curry is the best curry, even though you may temporarily stink up the hotel bathroom the following morning. The flavors were so complex.

One of my relatives mentioned his green curry chicken was too spicy (the minimum spice level for the green curry is 3 out of 10). Beware if you can't handle the spice.

The dumpling was exquisite. It looked cute.

The soup was somewhat sour, but I don't really mind. It came with tofu and mushrooms that my cousins didn't eat because they're picky.

The Singha beers cost $4."}
{"text":"I tried this place on my recent visit to city. I think other yelp reviews are very accurate. Place is very nice and cozy. Food is good. You can definitely taste different spices. Desert menu needs an upgrade but over all very good Thai food."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and expected to have a great experience - as we have never been let down by Nicky's before. 

I had ordered a noodle dish that came back severely undercooked and when it came back it seemed like they had mixed my old noodles with fresh ones because half if my noodles were still undercooked. My friend got one of their entrees and the first time she was served it was the wrong protein, the second time her order was incorrect. After sending it back the waitress came over to tell my friend that she was wrong and then we proceeded to wait almost an hour for her food to come back. At this point we asked the waitress to take her meal off the check and were still treated with sarcasm and rudeness. 

Bottom line I will not be returning to this location of Nicky's, I will only support their northside location"}
{"text":"Very decent Thai food, great ambiance, and good, humble service. This is a small BYOB restaurant (no charge for BYOB) in Verona. It is cozy and friendly. 

We got the spring rolls, which were well prepared and vegetarian, as appetizers. Then, we shared the green curry (with brown rice) and seafood curry special. They were both very tasty and spice levels were good.  We finished with the banana coconut roll, which was warm and very filling -- it came in six pieces. Overall, the quality and quantity was great. 

The restaurant is cozy. There are only 6-7 tables. The dark interior added romance to the air... along with our wine.  I definitely recommend Nicky's Thai Kitchen. It is worth a little scenic excursion to Verona."}
{"text":"Paying for the \"Thai\" spicy all night. They must use an oil as opposed to extra Thai peppers. Completely ruins that fresh Thai taste."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere outside! Delicious food, you can't go wrong on any order/ item. Always quick staff, but never feel rushed. Plus it's byob!"}
{"text":"I like their Thai style decor and the Thai music. I will recommend the red curry with 8 spicy level. And their salad was delicious. I love the pineapple in salad. I have tried a coconut icecream in a Thai restaurant before. I thought all Thai restaurants will provide it. But actually it wasn't in Nicky's dessert menu. I ordered one and it was so sweet that I had to drink a bottle of water."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place for lunch while in town for a conference, and it was wondeful.

I ordered mint steak salad, medium spicy. Only medium because in other places the medium is stronger than I can appreciate. I think I would go a little spicier next time. The steak was flavorful and had a good balance of lettuce, mint, and cucumbers.

The thai tea is more tea-like than I have encountered, but it was still flavorful.

I definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"A friend treated me to Nicky's Thai for my birthday earlier this fall. We had a reservation and were seated immediately; the service was great considering how busy they were. The food lived up to its reputation, and I especially enjoyed the unique and fun brass serving pots they used for my curry. The portions are very generous -- I think I got about three meals out of the dinner I ordered. 

The only drawback for us was the noise and closeness of the tables. I realize that space is at a premium downtown, but our table was literally a foot away from the others around us, and the background noise eliminated the option of conversation. We did go on a Friday night, so I would assume that this is not always the case. I would definitely return, but probably for lunch rather than dinner."}
{"text":"Nicky's Thai is a great Thai restaurant with a huge menu and a nice staff. I ordered Drunken Noodles (called Spicy Noodles on the menu). I also tried some of their spring rolls, which had a great rice wrap. Their foods are extremely spicy, so just be wary. The portions were huge and prices were reasonable, but not cheap. Service was pretty good, but nothing special. The restaurant is dimly lit and relatively quiet. I'd recommend this place for anyone wanting some Thai food and able to eat spicy. Blessings!"}
{"text":"Lunch was delicious and the portion was perfect. I had the Red Curry at medium spicy and would absolutely order it again."}
{"text":"The spicy noodles are amazing and live up to their name. The wait during lunch is a little long but also not unexpected."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are moving to the North Shore, so we figured we would check out some of the local restaurants.  We wondered into this little Thai restaurant this afternoon and we left amazed.  We walked in the front door, a little confused by the entryway that looked like we were now in someone's home.  We were seated in the small but cozy dining area that seats about 30.  The waitress was quick to come over and grab us a couple drinks.  We love crab rangoons and got an order asan appetizer.  She ordered Beef Pad Phet, and I got their Beef Pad Thai.  Within 5 minutes of entering the restaurant, we both had drinks, and our fresh rangoons were in front of us.  Our favorite rangoons to date came from a small Chinese restaurant in china town in Chicago and these blew the china town rangoons out of the water.  They were light, but PACKED with flavor.  We had barely finished the rangoons when our food arrived.  Everything was delicious! We have had some Thai food in the past so I wouldn't consider us experienced by any means, but this was incredible.  After our delicious meal, they boxed up the rest of our lunch and brought the check.  The food was incredible, but I was even more amazed by the great and quick service.  We were done eating and the check was paid within 20 minutes.  I have never had more quick and thorough service anywhere.  Overall we would rate Nicky's a 5/5 for the cosy atmosphere, great food, and even better service."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. 
Large tables (4 of us) have to wait much, much longer.. there were about 3 groups of 2 or 3 that went ahead of us, and we were standing for a good 20 minutes.

Once seated, the tables are pretty cramped.. so much so that their floor decor touches your seat. I had the dubious pleasure of sitting next to one of their statues of women with the prominent nipples staring at me at eye-level!

All lunch entrees give you a choice between soup or salad. The salad was amazing: mango slice with tomato, red onion, and some kind of sweet red (light) dressing. 

My entree, on the other hand, was not as enjoyable. I ordered the Wild Curry. It is one of the few curry dishes without coconut milk, and it was horrible!  It was either overly salted or contained too much fish sauce (methinks the latter). The folks I was eating with also could smell the fish sauce. 

Everyone else at the table enjoyed their dishes: cashew chicken and red curry.
But do yourself a favor and stay away from the Wild curry, folks (unless you want your stomach to do wild flips on ya!)"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I was stoked to see all of the veggie-friendly appetizers, and my friend and I split the Veggie 4 U appetizer.  The fresh rolls and spring rolls were good but nothing special.  Just fine.  The samosas were pretty bland and just tasted like sweet potato.

I ordered the Panang Curry with Tofu which was perfection - definitely the best thai dish I've had yet.  My friend wasn't overly fond of her green curry, but I'm writing this review on my perception not hers :)

Our server was really pleasant but misunderstood my friend's drink order twice, but he was very apologetic so it was hard to be annoyed about it.  I would really give this place 3/3.5 stars if it wasn't for the phenomenal Panang curry that I have been dreaming about ever since my visit.

Go for the Panang Curry and $4 glasses of wine and you will leave a happy customer."}
{"text":"For the area this is one of my fav thai restaurants. Its very clean and the whole staff is nice. The place is kinda small so it fills up pretty fast but the wait isnt too bad. They also have a small bar to sit at w/a tv so great for the games!

Now the food- veryyyy fresh i loved everything except the spice scale seemed a bit off. I love spicy food i ordered a 4 prob could have gone with a 6 on their scale. Great thai tea and i had thai basil chicken. So good! 

Deff worth trying!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend Nicky's Thai Kitchen for lunch. Not only is the food delicious but it is also very reasonably priced. We go there quite often for lunch on Saturdays. The lunch includes the entree and either a soup or salad mostly priced under $10. They typically have chicken noodle soup which is like no other chicken noodle I have ever tasted. There is a hint of ginger and other flavors to the soup which makes it delicious. I have tired the pad thai along with various curries. They are all delicious but my personal favorites are the pineapple curry and the massaman curry. When we first started going (about a year ago) I would get a spice level of 1 but have built up to a 3. I am not usually one to like spicy food but the mix of the spiciness and the sweetness of the curry is amazing. My husband loves the garlic chicken and the ginger chicken. They always include a crab rangoon with each entree. This is a nice touch and they are delicious. The decor is very pretty and they have a beautiful outdoor eating area for nicer weather. The staff there is wonderful. There is one particularly sweet waitress who remembers us each time we come in."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy the Thai fried rice with seafood. But today not so much. The calamari was over cooked and no shrimp!"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. Hands down my favorite restaurant to go to. I have been there at least 20 times and never disappointed."}
{"text":"Caught this place towards the tail end of the usual lunch time. My party of 4 was seated immediately. Pretty attentive service throughout the whole time. 

Crab Rangoon - Cream cheese was not extremely overwhelming. Perfect balance of crab as they don't skimp on it. This comes in about 8 pieces.

Pineapple Fried Rice - Pretty solid with large portions. Once again they are generous with their meat which I appreciate."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was happily surprised by the delicious and fresh food. The chicken Panang came with a choice of soup or salad. I chose the soup, yum. The Panang was spicy (I asked for it) and loaded with fresh veggies. Really a great deal and delight for $9.00!"}
{"text":"So we were craving Thai food so my brother brought us to the \"best\" Thai restaurant in town. When we ordered our waitress had limited knowledge about the dishes on the menu. We asked if the coconut juice was fresh or canned and she said not fresh or canned. So we ordered one glass of it. For appetizers we got chicken satay. I've been to Malaysia and Singapore so I know my satay. This was NOT satay! It was boiled chicken on a stick! No grill marks. 

When we tried the coconut juice and it was pure sugar. So we asked our waitress to change it for a coconut mojito instead and her response was \"we can't\". You can't change our drink for something else we want and will pay for??? She walked away and never returned to our table to ask about the food. Such awful service!!!

The food was so underwhelming!! 
Don't fall into the trap of the reviews if you're a real Thai food connoisseur!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried on their menu has been excellent. They get ridiculously busy during lunch, so make sure you get there by 11:30 if you don't want an hour long wait.

After trying almost everything on their menu, I keep coming back to Garprow Pork Lad Kao. For around $9, this dish can't be beat. It has flavorful meat, rice, egg and some greens. The steamed dumplings make for an excellent appetizer, and the dipping sauce they serve with the dumplings is very well done.

My only gripe with this place is the inconsistency in their 1-10 spice scale. A 9 tastes like 6 one day and 8 the other. I just gave up and started ordering 10. Maybe I should try 'Thai Hot', but I don't think my colleagues will appreciate that ;)"}
{"text":"My go-to dishes here are the spicy noodles (spice level 5) and the basil entree dish with veggies (spice level 5).  For the most part, they are always consistently good.  

On my most recent trip, I decided to venture away from my usuals and try out the Hang Lay curry (I think that's the name).  The description sounded appealing, with peanut sauce, chili paste, coconut milk, etc.  I got mine with veggies and my usual spice level 5.  

The taste of the curry was great - definitely hit the spot.  I wouldn't have minded more spice so I'll have to remember that for next time.  My only issue with the dish was there were these ginormous pieces of potatoes which took up most of the space in the curry.  I would've preferred more of other (green) veggies (broccoli, beans, etc.)  All in all it was very tasty."}
{"text":"Nice dark wood tables, clean.  Can get busy for a Thursday Night.  Staff is friendly and attentive.

Note a spiciness level of 4 is about a 6 to me.  4 is hotter than sirracha sauce.  

We ordered spicy chicken wings.  Fried wings then tossed with sauce.  Tender, good heat, still a bit hot.

Pumpkin curry Duck... Heat level 4.  No spice at all.  Large chunks of Japanese pumpkin with thin slices of duck... Initially I thought they gave me BBQ pork by mistake since I have not seen duck sliced do thin.  It had a reddish hue, they said it's marinated.  I confirmed the Duck when I had a piece of skin and fat.  Yummy over white rice."}
{"text":"Go here. So much food for the price! Authentic Thai food with true spice levels. I got the red curry with tofu and extra veggies. Made friends with my server - great customer service from everyone. Quick seating for a table for one. Stumbled across this gem while strolling around the city after an out of state work training.  I wish I lived in Pittsburgh for so many reasons - Nicky's is one of them and I'd be here every day if I did indeed live in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"The worst Thai food we have ever ate and bad service. Not a place for vegitatians! Read till the end!
Ordered two Pad See Ew with tofu, fried rice with tofu and chicken teriyaki. 
Chicken teriyaki was tough and pieces was too large. Our not-vegitatian friend who have been to Thailand and knows Thai  coisine didn't like this meal at all.
But the worst for us was that our vegitatian Pad See Ews: they were with small pieces of meat!! We asked a manager to change both Pad See Ews, we explained that on our opinion kitchen staff either use meat in the recipe or don't clean pans. The guy answered that the meal is vegitarian and asked us whether we want same meal if it's gonna be maid on the same pan (!!!!). And he asked us that what he will suppose to do if we don't like new meals again. What???
So we sad that we want fried rice instead because it wasn't bad at all. But later we cancelled this order at all because we were afraid that with this kind of service and manager they can even spit into our food. Manager agreed to cancel our order but asked us in a sarcastic way why we eat eggs if we are vegitatians. So, dear manager, you shouldn't talk like that with costumers. And people who don't eat eggs they are vegans , not vegetarians. Read about different types of nutrition and know that for most vegetarians cross-contamination with meat is not acceptable."}
{"text":"Great Thai on the north side and BYOB!  Be careful with their 1-10 hot scale, it is horribly inconsistent. I like hot and go with a 7 every time I'm there, and every time it is a different 7 ranging from no heat to melt your face. Wish they had the crispy duck salad that was at their downtown location"}
{"text":"Had a most delicious dinner at Nicky's the other night. The wait staff was so very friendly and attentive. The appetizers were scrumptious (though I do like Thai Cuisine's fresh rolls slightly better). The Tum yum and Green Curry rocked. Do yourself a favor and plan to visit Nicky's for dinner."}
{"text":"Yeah, so it pains me to write a poor review about this place because the food is not bad (I still like Thai Cuisine, Bloomfield better) but here goes the sad, short story.

I take a client to Nicky's.  Arrive at 11:50, check.  Place order at 12:10, check. Receive salad at 12:15 (not enough dressing), check.  Then silence. Food going everywhere except our table.  12:40: We flag down the waitress.  Hey waitress, everyone is getting food except us. Could you check on our order? 12:45, waitress returns: yeah, sorry, big mistake.  They bagged all of your food for take-out and it's been sitting on the counter. 12:50: Fine, guess we're not eating lunch.

So shit happens, right?  Here's the kicker.  We go to get our food and after wasting an hour of  our time, leaving us famished, and turning warm green curry from a tummy pleaser into cold, congealed take-out, they ask us to pay full price for our meals!  Like, what part of keep the customer satisfied don't you get?  So we do, and there it sits on my desk for another two hours. 

This is not rocket science.  You fail to serve a customer for an hour, you give them their food and maybe a discount coupon to get them to return.  Apparently not here.

I'll take my business to Thai Cuisine, Bloomfield.  Recommend you do as well."}
{"text":"I have decided to give this place an upgrade - a five star review from me is rare. I have eaten here about 30 times now and only 2 times the food was not as good as it usually is.

I still stick to my favorites, the Massaman Curry and the Pad Thai. Notable things left out of my prior reviews is that every few days they put real flowers into the table vases and switch the arrangements each time. There has been a serious effort designing the interior walls and decorations, but the place can feel really cramped on busy days as the tables are really close together. Each dish comes with a flower made out of carrot, and a crab/cheese ragoon placed on top, which is a nice touch. There is a nice looking outside dining area with a little fountain and lots of canapes. Some of the Thai servers should smile and be a little more happy, but you can expect several water refills throughout the meal. Each lunch dish comes with a salad or soup. I tried the soup once and wasn't a fan, but the salad has a really nice dressing. They could improve by using a more green salad and skipping the iceberg, however. Hopefully they will keep their lunch prices about the same ~$8, because I have to commute from downtown to get here for lunch and i would hate for them to stop making it worth my effort.

Food Quality/Taste = 5 Stars
Portion Size Given Price = 3 Stars (could be more, but I don't leave starving)
Price = 4 Stars
Service = 5 Stars
Experience with Staff = 4 Stars
Decor = 5 Stars

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I eat in here or get takeout usually once a week. When I think of Thai food in Pittsburgh, Nicky's is the first place that comes to mind. Their out back area is serene and a nice lunch hour retreat. I love so many dishes here it's hard to pick a favorite. Eat here. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Really good food! I had the chefs special steamed pork buns, the only reason I'm giving it a 4 is because the meat was slightly over cooked and chewy. Great ambiance and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I had such high expectations for Nicky's and sadly I left underwhelmed. The food was ok. I've heard several people say it's the best in Pittsburgh and I'd have to disagree. I got the Tom yum soup and it was ok. I also got the red curry with chicken. It was good. I got a spice level of 4 (on a scale from 1-5) and it still wasn't that spicy. I guess next time I need a 5. Based on food alone I think this place is a 4 star. What really brought this down to 3 stars was the service. Even on a busy Saturday night I would still expect service to be ok. Our server barely paid attention to our table and we had to ask several times for things like chopsticks. A couple times we had to get his attention when he popped up from the back."}
{"text":"Order the pad see ew! The mango salad with tofu was too spicy for me even at mild. Prices are okay and options are good. Wait wasn't bad for 6 and it was busy"}
{"text":"The food here is great. I'm not typically a huge fan of Thai Curries but Nicky's does an excellent job. I'm a local so ever time I go there I see some of my neighbors, it's a great neighborhood place. It's small, but they have seating in the backyard in the nice weather."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently stopped here for lunch and I'm SO glad we did. I get so frustrated with Americanized Thai cuisine but this is as close to authentic as you're going to get here in the burgh. Their spice scale is legit. My husband ordered his pad Thai at a level 10 and I thoroughly enjoyed watching him sweat it out! 

We started our meal with some Thai iced teas and an order of their crispy tofu peanut. The teas weren't overly sweet and were a nice offset to the spicy food. The crispy tofu was light but full of flavor with the peanut sauce. 

Both of our meals came with the soup of the day, which happened to be their chicken and rice. I have to say I wasn't at all disappointed. Slight hint of lemongrass was a welcome surprise to what normally would be a bland soup. 

We both ordered the pad Thai. Mine was a level 3 shrimp, his was a level 10 beef. No complaints on either end. The serving was quite large for lunch. 

All in all I would highly recommend and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I don't give out the five star review often but I can't deny Nicky's the highest marks.  Honestly if you are a fan of Thai they can do it all well.  I have never ordered anything that I didn't really like (even if it wasn't something I would order again).  My go to order is the spicy noodle with tofu and it is always great.  Always.  Also, I have never had chicken satay that comes close to their preparation - perfect flavor and always moist.  I know it sounds strange but the chicken noodle soup is one of the best things on the menu.  The broth outrageously good.  Overall fantastic which is probably why it is constantly crowded."}
{"text":"Loves this spot! Maybe become one of my favorite place to go in Pittsburgh! The scenery on back, the outside patio, beautiful!! Plants and lighting make the environment amazing there. 

The foods is amazing, great options, beverage is amazing as well. I order pineapple fried rice with chicken and Thai teas. Both cooked/brew to perfection. 

The Thai tea serves in two different flavor, green tea and original, I would recommend both to anyone. :) 

The waitress are friendly. 

Definitely a deaf friendly spot to go!"}
{"text":"Recently came here with a large group of friends for a birthday.  Excellent service and great food.  Corkage fee is first 2 bottles free, and the rest are 3 dollars.  Can't beat that!

Here I ordered the Lhad Na with tofu and at a number 8 on their spicy scale.  Very good.  However, I feel like they didn't give me a real \"8\" on their scale, because I'm white.  My asian companions ordered 8's and their dishes were notably spicier.  

Nonetheless, very good food!  I can't wait to come back.  Definitely the best Thai I've had in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Thai To Try
Hungry for good Thai food that is hard to find back home, we go to Nickie's for our very first night in town. Are we glad that we did.The food was excellent in every way exceeding our our most modest expectations.
Our choices:
Spring Roll assortment
Mint Beef Salad
Pad Thai Combo
Not in the best neighborhood,but, well worth the trouble."}
{"text":"Boy, has this place gone downhill. When I moved to the North Side of Pittsburgh in 2009 I was excited to discover that a Thai place was within walking distance, and that it was pretty good! Over the next couple of years I'd order from Nicky's occasionally and the quality of the food seemed to slide. I just got takeout from Nicky's for the first time in a while. It was packed, with a bunch of people waiting outside for a table. I ordered Pad Thai and a mango salad. The salad was disappointing - the pineapple in it actually tasted fermented and not in a good way. The Pad Thai was straight up disgusting. As hungry as I was I couldn't finish it. After a few forkfuls all I could taste was SALT and a sour vinegar-ish flavor. Sorry Nicky's, good for you for having throngs of customers and a new downtown location, but I'll drive across town for Thai takeout before I walk down the street for your nasty food ever again. Yuck."}
{"text":"Great flavor. Very reasonably priced. Gets very crowded so get there early during lunch. Nice setting"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai. The crab fried rice came in heaping portions with a lot of crab, but a little bland. The Tom Kha soup was silky smooth and the best I've had. The service could have been more attentive."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST tom kha soup I have ever had! My sister lived in Thailand and she bet me that this tom kha would not compare to the tom kha in Thailand she had on the beach made by a little old woman, I told her to try Nikki's and she was astounded! Needless to say I won that bet!  Love the atmosphere love the service and don't get me started on the crab rangoons omg. So good! I just moved here and literally went 4 nights in a row! Haha you got to go! Get the tom kha!!!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna go out on a limb and vote this my personal best restaurant in the city. I crave their \"chicken noodle soup\". You can feel it healing you with every sip. It's under the noodle soup section and I'm telling you it's the best broth you will ever have. I feel the same about their hot ginger tea, it's medicinal. The food is delicious, the service is great, the price is right. What more do you need when you're out to eat? Try both locations. Downtown is a little more upscale in its decor. Full bar in the back. Great date place. North side is quaint and fun too. Especially outside when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"On the basis of one visit, Nicky's deserves the praise. Wide array of menu choices. Great atmosphere. Fine service."}
{"text":"Ehh. I wasn't impressed. Lots of people told me about this place before I went and tried it. Once we finally got there the staff weren't the friendliest and the food was overpriced and not overly tasty."}
{"text":"This is from a visit a while back.  
Food was perfect, portions were great, service was friendly. The outdoor patio was worth the wait. So cute! I think about driving 5 hours just to eat there again. I'm not saying I would, but I think about it a lot."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai cuisine in the burgh. Everything is perfect, from the curry to the rice to the tea!!!!  God... I'm getting hungry again just writing this review"}
{"text":"Their food is absolutely amazing. Try their fish entrees and curries, these are usually very good. But best of all is the pumpkin curry... it even blows away the other \"best\" Thai places around town. For a real treat, get the pumpkin custard dessert, served over warm sticky rice - my teen daughters have begged me to bring it home on occasion!"}
{"text":"Sooo disappointed in this place last couple times there. Prices high, service pleasant, great atmosphere but food is just ok. Not very tasteful. Had the pineapple fried rice in which there were only a few pieces of very dry tasteless chicken and about 3 cashews. Must say their crab Rangoon the absolute best anywhere.  In no rush to head back. North side one better."}
{"text":"Good food, but poor service.  I called the restaurant on Aug 5th 2017 to place a pick order and was rudely addressed by their service person.  The lady hung up on me three times.  I normally frequent their penn ave.  location where the service is great and the food equally delicious."}
{"text":"Just an update to note that Nicky's now DOES charge a corkage fee."}
{"text":"Really?  You have several tables open and no line but you won't put one person at a 4 top - even after I tell you I can't sit on high bar seats because of bad knees and a recent knee replacement.

Update:  40 minutes later 3 of the tables are still available."}
{"text":"I ate here this past Wednesday evening with my girlfriend and two other dining companions.  Our dining companions got there before us and had a 5 minute wait before being seated outside on the patio.  Whenever we arrived we had a hard time finding them since no one really stepped up to ask us anything but we eventually did. The patio here is actually a really cool place.  It has a jungle-esque feel with plants all over the place with a fountain in the corner as well as a large amount of umbrellas to block the sun and space heaters for the winter.

It took about 20 minutes after we were seated to order and my girlfriend and I decided to start off our meal with the crispy tofu.  It came served on a plate with what was supposed to be a sweet and sour sauce although I believed it to be a sweet chile sauce.  In any case I really enjoyed it.  The tofu itself was fried up nicely and the outside tasted great.  However it seemed to made with semi firm tofu whenever I would have much preferred extra firm.  Whenever we finished up our appetizers we were once again subjected to another long wait before our meals came.  For my entree I ordered the duck curry (Thai spicy) which was a regular menu item.  Confusingly there was also a grilled duck curry special that was $6 more that I did not see but ended up getting.  It came out in the normal coconut and red curry broth with tomatoes, peppers and a side of jasmine rice. The duck was actually perfectly cooked and not greasy at all which made me happy to have gotten the special.  The curry also had a good flavor and was slightly spicy but not Thai spicy in my book.  We had originally been thinking about ordering dessert as well but after the long waits we decided to cut our losses and head home without it.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  The food by itself was easily 5 stars, now if their service can only match the food."}
{"text":"Amazing.  I had the Pineapple Curry with shrimp.  So so good. Can't wait to go back.  The atmosphere is lovely and the ginger tea also good."}
{"text":"I had been so excited to try this restaurant since I moved here last year as I am a lover of Thai food and the reviews of this place are really good.  Well, I just tried the North Side location tonight and am SO disappointed!  We ordered three appetizers and two entrees: crispy spring rolls, crab rangoons, Thai shrimp toasts, pork pad thai, and cashew chicken.  There wasn't a single thing I liked.  We did takeout, and the appetizers were all soggy in our 15 minute door-to-plate trip.  The crispy spring rolls had a curry filling which was unexpected and unwelcome.  The crab rangoons had a sickeningly sweet and very soupy filling.  The shrimp toasts had the texture of cold fried tofu or savory Bread pudding chunks:/. And the pad Thai - It may have been the pork that caused the pad thai to be bad... It smelled weirdly like dog food - don't get me wrong, I don't mean they serve dog food; but the smell was bothersome.  I didn't end up eating any of the meat. Lastly, the cashew chicken was waaayy too heavy on the fish sauce.  This is my favorite Thai dish and I couldn't eat it because of the strong fish taste.  I will continue looking for my favorite Pittsburgh Thai restaurant.  So disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm going to go with 4 stars here HOWEVER, I think the North Shore location is slightly better even though I would also give them 4 stars. 

When coming for lunch during the week, get there when they open at 11:30. They fill up very quickly. Food will come fast and there are a ton of staff members but it does get a little chaotic. 

They take reservations for dinner but if you go early enough you would be fine without one most days. 

This time I came during lunch and it was a group of 4. I had the pineapple curry, one coworker had the panang curry and 2 other had the Phad Phet with shrimp. All recommended! 

I wouldn't say best Thai in Pittsburgh but there are a few at the top of the list and this is included!"}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions for lunch and some late night meals when I've been downtown.  They have a rather small restaurant, and during the lunch hours it can get fairly packed.  The restaurant is tactfully decorated to match it's ethnic background.  

The menu here is fairly simple with some basic but creative dishes.  My favorite by far has been the spicy basil fried rice with chicken.  It is spot on with some vegetables and rice as well as having a good amount of kick to it.  If you aren't a huge fan of heat, you can choose to have a lower heat level for any dish.  Last time I was here, my wife ordered pineapple rice with chicken.  She thoroughly enjoyed it which had some sizable chunks of pineapple and other vegetables.  The only complaint I would have is I've noticed a less than ideal amounts of chicken in the dishes.  Other than that, the portion typically is more than a single meal.

This is a cool place to have some good Thai food.  If you are nervous about trying Thai, but enjoy rice dishes, this will be a great place to start! I've also had their pad Thai here and it was extremely excellent.  Not a bad price for a downtown meal and their service, food, and staff has been very consistent."}
{"text":"Came to Nicky's on a weeknight for a wonderful Thai dinner. There was plenty of seating and it was not too busy on a weekday evening. The service was quite fast and at several times throughout the meal, multiple waiters came and checked on us. Though it is a bit pricier than other Thai restaurants in town, it is very authentic and you are able to customize the spice-level of your dish (from a 1 to 5 range) which allows you to get exactly the level of heat you want. Though it can be hard to find parking in the Cultural District, this meal is worth it!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Pittsburgh and have been to the original Nicky's Thai in the Northside.  My parents swear that is the best Thai food they've ever had to this day.  While I was in town over the holidays my husband and I had dinner at this location.  It's probably been 8 or 9 years since I've had Nicky's Thai and honestly I was a little disappointed with it.  The décor and the atmosphere was nice and the food was tasty but non memorable.  The drink selection was really poor with the exception of Chang beer which is what I drank the whole time I was in Thailand a few months ago.  
What turned me off the most was that the portions were absolutely ginormous, and the entrees were expensive for Thai food.  If they didn't serve enough food for 3 people in an entrée they could lower the prices to something more reasonable.  I split an appetizer and an entrée with my husband and it was more than enough food.  Maybe the original is still better but I wouldn't rush back to this location."}
{"text":"I like this place but it was: too expensive, food was mediocre for price.  Still doesn't trump my favorite Thai place in town (which I'll be reviewing next!) which is still tastier than the others and hella cheap."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try either of the Nicky's Thai Kitchens for over a year now. Our one attempt to try Nicky's in the North Side was on a Sunday, which we quickly discovered is not a day that they are open. 

I work Downtown and decided on Monday that I was going to finally try the newer location of Nicky's just a 7 minute walk from my workplace. Well, this would've been a great idea if it wasn't about 20 degrees outside with an even lower wind chill. However, I somehow innately knew that Nicky's would be worth the (extremely cold and face numbing) effort to get there. 

I got back to my office and opened up my $8 Pad Thai to-go lunch. I had selected the side salad to go along with my meal... and it made me laugh. It was in the tiniest takeout container I had ever seen and contained 3 pieces of lettuce, 2 chunks of pineapple, and even smaller portions of everything else. I must admit it was tasty though! My recommendation? Save the cost of the teeny to-go container and offer a larger version of the same side salad for +$2-3 that contains some substance. 

Now let's get back to the important matter... the Pad Thai. I consider myself a snob about just a few dishes, and Pad Thai is one of them. If going to a Thai restaurant, I order Pad Thai about 90% of the time. If the Pad Thai is too bland or not sweet enough or contains too many bean sprouts or too little meat, I am not interested in returning to the restaurant.....

Nicky's Pad Thai was the. best. Pad. Thai. I. have. ever. had. I sat at my desk listening to my Monday conference call inhaling the delicious noodles, the perfectly sweet and mildly spicy (the way I like it!) sauce, the crumbled peanuts, the large chunks of green onion, and the scrambled eggs mixed throughout the dish. This is Pad Thai heaven. 

To top it off, my meal had a little Crab Rangoon on top, which (behind Pad Thai) is one of my favorite Thai foods. Needless to say, I'll be back for lunch often and can't wait to bring my husband as well."}
{"text":"The hubby and I have been wanting to try Nicky's Thai Kitchen for years now. I recently had an amazing experience at Nicky's in Downtown and had been really wanting my husband to try Nicky's. Since we were leaving for NYC the next day, I decided Nicky's would be delicious yet affordable for New Year's Eve dinner.

Though I thought it may be silly (since I didn't imagine Nicky's being a popular NYE spot), I did make reservations. However, the restaurant was full the entire time we were there! It was a lot smaller than I had expected, and my hubby and I were packed at a small table between two other couples.

We started our meal with a glass of Riesling - gotta love BYOB! - and some appetizers, the Crab Rangoons and Thai Samosas. The Thai Samosas were delicious. I loved that instead of being filled with regular potatoes that the lightly fried pastry was stuffed with sweet potatoes. Crab Rangoons are a favorite of mine, and these were literally the best I've ever had. I could drink that crab meat and cream cheese mixture. So yummy!

I ordered my typical Pad Thai for my entree. It was tasty, but not quite as delicious as the Pad Thai that I had gotten a couple weeks prior at the downtown location. I was a little disappointed... once you've experienced a 10/10 on the Pad Thai scale, having an 8/10 is a little bit of a letdown. 

Though we were stuffed, I just had to try one of their desserts. My husband and I split the Black Stick Rice with the Pumpkin Custard. I immediately felt cheered up... it was incredible. I am often disappointed by desserts in Asian cuisine due to their lack of sweetness, but this dessert was the perfect balance of sweet and savory. 

Overall, I had a very nice experience and enjoyed my NYE dinner. I look forward to coming back again!"}
{"text":"The food here was really good and was about a fifteen minute walk from Point State Park (with 3 kids under 9). I was really looking forward to some Vietnamese food, but everyone else was in the mood for Thai. I ordered the noodle soup with beef, and it was pretty close to the Vietnamese Pho I love at Pho Lang Tang in Findlay Market in Cincinnati. The broth in my soup was incredibly flavorful. I have a pretty high tolerance for \"heat\" in my foods. The waiter asked me how spicy would I like to go, on a scale of 1 to 5, 5 being the hottest. I asked him how spicy be thought 5 was, he said pretty spicy. . . so I went with 4. I don't like my food so spicy that you can't taste what you are eating, that being said. . . I could have easily gone for the 5. . . everyone had different pallets for heat I suppose. The soup was really good. Some of the other things ordered at our table was crab rangoon, a mango scallop something or other, and crab fried rice, which my wife said was the best fried rice she has ever had. Overall, we had a very good meal and it was reasonably priced. 3 adults and 3 kids, one being 2, and the bill was less that 50 dollars. We chose to drink water, and we are aware of what our children eat, we do our best to never over indulge. Still walked out with leftovers."}
{"text":"It's addicting.....I keep trying new dishes and keep loving this place.....it's a little more family recipes tasting then basic Thai food......my favorite"}
{"text":"Just finished my soup and grilled squid appetizers. I don't need to wait for the main course to give my review. Something horrible would have to happen to lower my opinion opinion here.

Got the pumpkin curry. I swear I teared up. Please come here. So good...so good."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes yes! Those are the first words that come to mind after my experience at Nicky's. This is one of those restaurants I've been dying to try for so long. Not only does it have a great Yelp reputation, but many friends have tried it and say nothing but positive things. 

I arrived around 5:30PM and I was one of the only tables in the dining room. By the time we left, nearly every table was full. The dining room was quite small and sort of awkward, but the food definitely made up for that. I know Nicky's is known for it's beautiful patio section, but unfortunately I visited during a snowfall. Bummer.

The food was incredible. Not only was the presentation beautiful, but the quality and taste were superb! I'm not too much of an ethnic food fan, but Nicky's has me making an exception. I ordered the cashew chicken dish and ate every last bit. Everything from the veggies, to the sauce to the meat was excellent. It definitely had a bit of a zing to it (they ask you how spicy you would like your dish beforehand), but I wouldn't have it any other way! Two meals and a tip came out to be around $40. Not bad considering how much food you get. 

Service was decent and we didn't have to ask for more water as they were already a step ahead. Oh, btw-- It is BYOB! Nothing better than that. There is a $5 corking fee. 

I can't wait to return and check out their patio. Now with the weather breaking up, I'm sure I'll be visiting soon!"}
{"text":"Very little to pick on at Nicky's We were a five with two pumpkin curries, one spicy peanut, one green curry, and one massaman curry. A mixed veggie app platter, a few desserts to split, a couple drinks. The banana dessert was a bit rough on the wrap, once deep fried, but still nice. Overall, some of the best curry I've had anywhere. The heat gauge seemed to be right on, the service was impeccable, and it's a lovely atmosphere. We'll be back on our next trip to Pittsburgh. Oh, the total for five at dinner was $110, a great price."}
{"text":"Ordered the Hung Ley curry w/ vegetables ($8.95) and crab rangoon appetizer ($6.50).  Curry was delicious, but the whole peanuts made the dish too crunchy for us (it does list whole peanuts in the description, we just expected a different texture).  I would skip out on the crab rangoon since although tasty like the cream cheese wontons from Panda Express, I couldn't taste any crab.  

Our server was friendly, and asked about allergies when we asked to have the pineapples taken out of our curry.

Gets crowded!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Pittsburgh, hands down.  Everything I have tried was fantastic.  Rather than go into detail about specific dishes, I will tell you that the service is fantastic with all the wait staff extremely attentive and the food comes out piping hot, something I wish more restaurants would pay attention to.  Every dish has been fantastic, all hot and served by great employees, what more could you ask for?  

This is one of my select few of go to places every time I come to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Giving Nicky's a very solid 4!  We had reservations, and were sat right away.  We were greeted soon after and given water and got our orders in.  The food came out pretty quickly as well.  Everyone there is so polite, and what everyone on here says about the refills on water is true.  It is constantly refilled!  I got the Pad Thai level 1.  Not spicy at all and the flavor of the noodles were great.  Only complaint I have is that the chicken was a little dry and not flavorful, kind of reminded me of the chicken you get from Chinese takeout.  The pad Thai itself made up for that.  We also got the steamed dumplings appetizer, highly recommend!  Very flavorful and a perfect portion size for 2 people.  We will definitely be back to try more from Nicky's."}
{"text":"It's beautiful on the inside!  However the tables are very close together, and I feel like it was kind of loud.  But the food is amazing, and the portions are huge.  I had the salmon salad which was unbelievable.  The service was good, pretty quick.  Definitely need make a reservation on the weekends for dinner, though.  But it's probably the best Thai food I've ever had."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly and served quickly! We went for lunch very near to opening and it did get quite busy.

I had the spicy noodle (I think one spice away from the spiciest?) and it was great! Glad I did not get it any hotter. The noodles are thick and delicious, I could bathe in them all day. The serving size is enormous, to be expected, I could not finish, but they gladly wrapped it up so I could take it home.

Service I will mention again, is very efficient, which I enjoyed. The place is nicely decorated."}
{"text":"I've been to Nicky's over 2 dozen times since it's opened and have never had a bad meal or experience there. The food is excellent and the service is typically pretty speedy. It's definitely our Go-To place for Thai food."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! Never disappointed with my meal here! Love the pad Thai, and green curry. I recommend the north side location!"}
{"text":"Thai food is one of my favorites and I always make a point to try new places when traveling or venturing out to a new place at home. I happened upon Nicky's Thai Kitchen when I was in town for a business conference. I was craving some Thai food and luck would have it, there was a restaurant a few blocks from my hotel. I have to say that I was not disappointed with my decision to try Nicky's. The service was great. Even though we had dropped in during their lunch rush, we got a table quickly, the wait staff was very attentive, and the service was still extremely fast despite how busy they were. The food was amazing and the portions were huge. The owner of the restaurant made a point to visit with every table to check in on each customer and they even gave us a few Thai donuts for free. Overall, I'd say that Nicky's has fast service, amazing, authentic Thai food, large portions, and cheap prices. This is definitely a place to try if ever in Downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Went there last night. Seriously one of the best Thai placed in Pittsburgh. My boyfriend and I shared the crab Rangoon and I had the Param tofu and he had pad phet. He did order a level 4/10 and it was a bit spicier than expected but overall good food. The service was very fast too."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner before seeing the Book of Mormon. It was not crowded which was a nice surprise.

Our server was very friendly and prompt. We started with crab rangoon, which was excellent. It's nice to have the house-made version rather than the big-box Chinese fast food version!

I tried a catfish dish (can't quite remember the name because their online menu is slightly different from what I actually saw in the restaurant). It was good, although I'm not sure I'd get it again. I know that doesn't make sense haha! Their spiciness scale is just a pinch hotter than I had expected, so my 7 was a little beyond my comfort zone as someone who enjoys spicy food.

The space is a little cramped, like there are two or three too many tables in the space. The servers are always getting in each other's way, and it was difficult to maneuver back out of the place. But that's a minor detail.

This will definitely be a stop for us before events downtown!"}
{"text":"Nicky's Thai Kitchen attempts to whisk you away to a far off land with the ambiance and decor. I find this location appropriate for date night (although it can get loud) or a delicious meal out with friends. 


The  service is fantastic. I have visited many times before baseball games or plays and they almost always can get us in. And above all, I love the flavor profiles (especially the spice) here. 

Personally, I like to order the shrimp toasts as an app. Then I like to get the basil bok choy tofu. Spicy #7.

Perfect amount of spice. Delicious amounts of flavor bursts.

I will say that I took 1 star off for take out. Spicy #7 is more like NO SPICE when you order take out. I think they forgot to add the spice.... which is my favorite part. I won't order takeout again, but I will definitely return for more in-restaurant meals."}
{"text":"Amazing, and amazingly affordable. The food is delicious, the atmosphere is perfect, and the service is spectacular. We got our entrees in under 10 minutes, but it tasted like it too an hour to cook. Just eat here now!"}
{"text":"An enthusiastic five stars. 
Wow.  I've had Pad Thai a hundred times in my life and I'm pretty sure these guys just topped em all. Savory and sweet but not overly so. And, my lovely wife Carmen had the Thai Crab fried rice. They should give it a new name because it's nothing like the thrown together rice with some egg and soy splashed on that you get at most restaurants.  Just spicy enough and a mindful diner would notice that every bite was a little different than the last.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We got takeout and I'd had Nicky's once before and thought it was good. Last night I found out it's so much better than I gave credit. We had the spicy noodles and I got a 6 and it was pretty hot. I can handle spice and it was an impressive kick. The chicken was almost kind of crumbled and i really, really enjoyed it this way. We also had green curry with tofu. I don't fancy myself to be a curry loving kind of gal but the flavor was so fresh that it was impossible not to enjoy it. We ordered rice for the kids and poured wonton soup on top and I pretty much gobbled that up too. Already planning my next visit. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food and they give a lot of it! This place has lines during lunches and dinners so expect a bit of waiting. Food is worth it! Tom yum soup, crab Rangoon, pineapple curry were my faves"}
{"text":"It's easy to drive by and not think anything of this Thai restaurant. But don't make that mistake. Both the indoor and outdoor seating is very welcoming.  
Don't expect to blow through either. This is a sit down, relax and enjoy your meal.  If you want fast this is not the place for you. But if you want a nice experience with authentic Thai food you will be pleased. 
The staff is pleasant and the food is awesome. 
Try anything, it's all good. I particularly enjoy the green curry.  On a scale of 1 to 5, 3 is spicy. 4 will make you sweat, but wash it down with their traditional ice tea. Don't scrimp on desert. The Mango with sticky rice and ice cream is refreshing.

It is best to make reservations, especially for parties of 5 or more."}
{"text":"You know when a friend, who's an amazing cook, with a small apartment invites you for dinner party and you're like, gahhh, it's so small and noisy but I want her foooooood...? 

Nicky's Is that friend. 

Up the front stairs, step in a long narrow hallway, bump and shuffle to the teeeeeny hostess area and put your name in, call ahead if you're bringing you're crew. 

When your name is called, you get to enter the small dining area. 
The size of my moms living room. 
Who cares? 
I'd stand in a coat closet with my arch nemesis if it meant I could eat this food. 

It's noisy, tight, warm and fabulous.

The food was pretty spot on. There was 6 of us, once seated, all comfortable. We had some wine (BYOB no corkage fee except on weekends!!), and had a fabulous 2 hour dinner party. 

We did a sampling of appetizers. 

Fresh rolls were good, they had tofu in them. Would've liked to have had an option for shrimp.  I'm pretty sure they were pre-made and stored in fridge which isn't the worst thing in the world....except it's a FRESH roll.  I know fresh rolls, my friend. Anyway, still tasty. 

Dumplings. Flavorful, a little chewy. 

Crab rangoons. Good.

Fish cakes. Good. 

Chicken satay. Great. 

Tom Kah soup. The bomb. A nice spicy sour base broth with a lovely lemongrass balance with lots of fresh veggies and seafood. We got the large pot to share...an okay size. I'd get this again in a heartbeat. 

I had the garlic chicken/mild spice, delicious. I'd def go back for it. Smooth sauce with rich flavor, snap peas/chicken/mushrooms. 

My dinner companions were pleased as well. 

Portions were good. Not ridiculously big but ample. 

Not great for kids. 

Outdoor seating are looked nice, but it was just to hot outside. Lots of plants and a pergola.  

I had mango sticky rice for dessert. Perfection. 

I will alert you that I am a Thai food fanatic. So any Thai food makes me happy. But this ranked above average."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've found north of the city. I've only ordered to go, but I find that the food is still great after the 15-20mins it takes for me to get home. The potion sizes are HUGE. One order of pad thai literally lasted me 3 decent meals, which really helps to justify the $14 price. The 3 out of 5 is on the spicier side of medium, as a heads up. I love this Thai food, and it's become a staple in our take out rotation."}
{"text":"It was okay, but I wouldn't rave about it. Maybe it was what I ordered (pad see ew with chicken) because I ended up comparing it to another place I go to, which is a bit cheaper and delicious. The portion was a good size and the waiter was wonderful despite it being somewhat busy. I ended up having leftovers for the next day...bonus! I disliked how small the inside was, which is where two of us sat in a corner. Walking in is crowded right off the bat with us standing by the doorway waiting to be seated while other people try to escape through the narrow hallway. We didn't make reservations at all and it worked out for us somehow. I would give this place another chance and pick something different off the menu because I love Thai food."}
{"text":"This place is great!

Location... residential but not out of the way
Food... delicious, very flavorful. Was able to let them know how spicy I wanted the food on a scale of one to ten, and it seemed correct.
Seating... back patio is awesome... very nice.
Service... was visited often, my glass of water was continually topped off.
Drinks... people next to me brought in wine, so it appears to be BYOB. Always a plus!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and service.  I had the banana seafood curry. I liked it but cant say I loved it. The bananas were super raw and I usually prefer little sweetness. That being said, the patio is so beautiful. Great crowd too."}
{"text":"Very busy at lunch time. Good food, nice decor and great service. Spring roll appetizer is huge. I couldn't empty my water glass before having it refilled even though my food was 'Thai hot'"}
{"text":"As big fans of Nicky's North Side location, we were pretty optimistic that their new(ish) downtown location wouldn't disappoint. Simply put...it didn't.

The vibe is definitely more \"downtown\" and upscale, but the service and food are equally excellent. This location has a liquor license, and we were surprised at their reasonable prices on many of the alcoholic beverages. The menu looks a bit different, but is nearly identical to the North Side location.

Similar to the Western Ave. Nicky's, this location gets crazy busy, and the layout has even more tables crammed into a fairly small space. Be prepared to get a little cozy with your neighbors.

Overall, we were really pleased with every aspect of our experience, and will likely be back soon. The food standards were on par with their other location, and it was nice to see some of their top waitstaff from the North Side working downtown!"}
{"text":"Now, I'm no Thai connoisseur but in the last year since first trying Thai food, I've tried it just about everywhere I can in Pittsburgh and anywhere else I've ventured. I've also been obsessed enough to take Thai cooking classes and begin cooking at home. So, where did this little obsession begin? Nicky's Thai Kitchen.

My wife and I frequent Nicky's about one-a-week, on average, and it's currently one of our two favorite Thai places in Pittsburgh. We love the Smiling Banana Leaf, as well, but our proximity to Nicky's usually gives it the nod.

We've sampled just about every part of the menu at this point, and I can't say that I've ever been truly disappointed. The biggest food disappointment was probably the choo chee fish, but not because of flavor. The complaint is due to the new dish that they serve it in. The tables are just too small and cramped to deal with the giant fish-shaped metal serving dish they're using now.

One other potential complaint goes out to those of you with a lack of love for spicy food. My wife usually orders a spicy level of 3 or so, but we've had a few meals of hers come out in the 5-7 range. Considering how often we've eaten at Nicky's, I'd say your odds are still good, though, that you'll get what you want.

The only other complaint is that when it gets crowded, you REALLY feel it in the winter. Your personal space can feel non-existent depending on the layout of the tables, and the noise levels start to get a little too loud, but hopefully your food will make up for it. The warmer months ease this issue, as the outdoor patio - while also small - provides enough alternative seating to open up the floor and make for a more relaxed dining experience. Not to mention, the outdoor space is really nice.

As far as the food, I've tried an assortment of curries, noodle dishes, rice dishes, soups, and appetizers. I'm a huge fan of their fresh spring rolls. The rest of the appetizers aren't going to standout too much from the pack (all good...just pretty typical), but the fresh spring rolls are done really well, with a nice balance of flavors, and perfectly-softened rice wrappers. My favorite app there was the corn tods, but those were only on their specials menu for a while. They were excellent corn fritters that weren't too greasy and heavy. I hope they bring them back in the spring/summer.

The noodle dishes are all very good. My favorite is the spicy noodle, but the pad thai is an addictive go-to, as well. In fact, I could probably eat either dish every day of the week. 

All of the curries that I've tried have also been excellent, as well as some of the chef specials. The Gaprow Lad Kao is a fun spicy basil & ground meat dish over rice with fried egg on top. It came as a recommendation from our server once, and it's become a regular dish of mine, although it's usually a little too much food. The other basil dishes are excellent, and their Tom Kha soup is very good. Recently, they've had crab fried rice on their specials menu, and it's incredibly good. When you think \"fried rice\", you tend to think of that heavy, greasy kind from your hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant or hibachi, but Nicky's pulled off a fried rice that's light, simple and incredibly flavorful with a nice amount of crab meat!

Stopping short of reviewing every dish I've tried at Nicky's, I'll just say that it's worth checking out if you're looking for good Thai in Pittsburgh. Nicky's is a nice BYOB spot that doesn't charge a corking fee, has nice, speedy service, a great outdoor area, and wonderful food that you'll likely become slightly addicted to."}
{"text":"This is my first review. Take it with a grain of salt, but the pad Thai I had was excellent! Texture was fantastic, spice was definitely a 10/10 as I asked for. Mixed seafood was not overcooked and not overpowering. 
Highly recommend this place for the reasonable price, more than adequate amount of food, helpful wait staff, and comfortable environment. 
Oh, and the sweet salad was unexpectedly refreshing, and I would almost only want that if I didn't want the spicy noodles so much!"}
{"text":"Food was out of this world!! I've had my fair share of Thai food, and this restaurant just serves such unique flavors I've never had before. Boyfriend and I were blown away! On top of that, the staff is extremely friendly. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait a while, as this place is far from \"speedy.\"  In a half-full restaurant, we waited about 15 minutes just to get our order taken, and food came out at a snail's pace as well.  The guy in charge of water refills was totally on his game, however, and though we were hungry, thirst was not a problem.

The food here is really good.  The menu offers a decent and well-rounded selection of the standards (curries, rice noodles, soups) plus some more interesting house specialties which add the restaurant's own flare on top of traditional choices.  They also provide some welcome rarities, like the Wild Curry (a curry dish with no coconut milk for those who want a change of pace or something less sweet) and some dessert options (like pumpkin custard).

Recommendations:
-If you live nearby, make this a take-out place.  Call in the order and avoid the rush.
-If you don't live nearby but are in the area, stop in if and only if you have a lot of time and are craving Thai (there are plenty of other good nearby options as well, like Carmi Family Restaurant practically across the street).
-If you aren't in the area and want Thai food, there are lots of other good options in Pittsburgh, so you might consider passing this one up."}
{"text":"First time there and the food A-MAZING!! We ate outside, get there before winter hits and enjoy the atmosphere.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Got there for lunch right at open and had trouble opening the front door and thought they were closed. Luckily, someone came and opened the door! The dining area was already nearly full, and by the time we left people were cramming the hallway waiting. I got the tom kha (which was nice) and my boyfriend got pad thai, not being familiar with thai food and unsure what to try. We ordered spice level 9/10 after being heavily warned by our waiter not to do 10/10; he convinced us to get the spice tray instead, since it's easier to add spice than remove it. Well... after tasting our food, we both hit up the spice tray pretty hard, so I was expecting a little spicier! But overall it was good. (Warning for those reading: we are probably more accustomed to spicy food than the average pittsburgher.)"}
{"text":"Pad Thai is my favorite thing to eat period. Nicky's Thai has the best Pad Thai. Period. I appreciate that they can accommodate my requests to make the dish vegan and really know how to make a dish SPICY. Every other Asian restaurant I've been to, I've asked for a 10 in spice level and get a 3 back. I LIKE HEAT. This place knows heat! If I could have their Pad Thai every night, I totally would. It's THAT good."}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place, but postponed my drive to Verona until my last supper in Pittsburgh. Verona is not far from the urban East End, but it is unusual for me to travel that far for a meal. I think Verona is perhaps the sweetest little town, with a bangin' antique mall, and this might make a great day coupled with some Nicky's food, but I don't think you can review entire towns on yelp. 

Anyway, Nicky's Thai Kitchen. Suitable for a hungry vegan, vegetarian or omnivore, the menu is full of tantalizing options. We started with the fresh spring rolls, which were tasty and beautifully presented. Unfortunately, there was nothing too special about them. They were acceptably good, but not exceptionally great. 

Generally, I order a pineapple curry at any new thai place - this is a \"gold standard\" by which I can draw even analysis of all thai places. However, I had heard SO MUCH about Nicky's pumpkin curry, well, my apologies to the neglected pineapple curry. My dining companion & I shared this pumpkin curry and a panang curry. They were both delicious, but the pumpkin was better. The pumpkin stood in for a \"meat\" with its texture and density. The subtle sweetness of the gourd balanced the delicious spiciness of the curry. The vegetables accompanying it were crisp and tasted ultra-fresh. 

The interior is well-lit, but small. The staff is attentive & quick. The decor is interesting, but low-key. The bathrooms were clean and private. The sidewalk presence of Nicky's Thai Kitchen - with bright tiny strings of lights, precious tables, and a potted jungle - is more adorable than Sarah Palin when she's been trapped in her own backpedaling and tries to \"cute\" her way out of it. 

I'm pretty sure I ate at every delicious Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh, and I'm willing to go on record and say that Nicky's is worth leaving city limits for. It will charm your pants off without any heavy-handed cheezy crapola and leave your stomach and mouth begging for more. I seriously think about that pumpkin curry at least once a day, and it's been almost a month since I ate there."}
{"text":"Finally, Nicky's. Where your cup runneth over with... water. Seriously, every time I reached 90% empty, REFILL! I tried to make it a game to see if I could empty my cup before it was filled again, but decided I didn't want to pee myself.

Anyways, I was pretty impressed with Nicky's; It's hard to distinguish between the two, for me at least. The service and quality of food at both were on the same level - excellent. 
I mean, the service alone was just outstanding. Super attentive and very accommodating.

On top of that, the most important thing is obviously the food. I'll admit the only entrée I've had each time I go here is the curry. It comes in this great metal bowl with a side of rice. For me the flavor is a 10. I usually get around a 7 on the spice level. I got 9 once and my face hurt, and certain parts of the next day weren't pleasant. But. If that's your thing, go for it!

I've also had the thai toast appetizer, which are yummy little bites of fried pork served with a vinegary sauce. And the thai tea, good strong flavor, no complaints. 

Last time I went, I was with someone who is obsessed with thai food, and he said it was on his top two thai places he's ever had, so I'll take his word for it... can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"It was amazing! I got the Green Curry with Sea Bass. The fish was fried to perfection and the green curry had a complex and sweet flavor, BEST I've ever had. My boyfriend got Lad Gawpro (sp?) - a pretty traditional thai rice dish with ground pork, and it was so flavorful and full of spices. The interior had dark red walls with various golden elephants / Buddha / peacocks / various deities - felt very luxe compared to your usual casual Thai place!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Pittsburgh. The service is always exceptional, and the outdoor seating area is beautiful. I can't rave enough about their food. BYOB! One of our favorite spots."}
{"text":"Overrated. 

Pad thai was mushy and gross, felt like I was gumming my food.  
Spicy thai fish was okay but not spectacular and definitely not worth the money.  

What I liked most was that the food came out really fast, but I guess that didn't take any time to prepare it."}
{"text":"I'm baaaack!! And had the same amazing experience. Hung Lay Curry and Tom Yum Soup, both excellent! I ordered both dishes as spicy as possible (level 10) and, oh man, it was delicious. Definitely not for the faint of heart though! Thank you, Nicky's for being so consistently awesome. I can't wait to come back, yet again!"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant I've ever been to! Better than anything I've ever had all over the west coast. That's seriously saying a lot given I'm from CA. Great flavors, perfect spice level (I usually get 8-10/10 @ most restaurant but my friend wanted only 5/10. Even then it was just perfect. Can't explain), generous portions (green curry mango with tofu had so many veggies. My fav!), nicely decorated, great ambiance, wonderful staff and all those authentic dishes. Can't wait to come back. Posted some pic, too. :-)"}
{"text":"Walked in to play Musical chairs between a waitress and host to finally be sat down and waited on to be told to move because of a reservation. The table we were asked to move to was in a far small corner and wedged in between a family of 12 which had seats on the end of both tables and also a additional family beside us which is considered a FIRE HAZARD! My partner and I came in 10-15 minute prior to the 6pm  reservations. We were barely waited on a already had bad service. So in other words we got up and left."}
{"text":"This is a review on take out only since, unfortunately, we were not able to dine in this past Friday night. In an old Victorian house, this is such a cute building with a gorgeous outdoor patio, tucked away in such a revitalized area of the city. I called to place a take out order at about 8 pm this past Friday. My call was answered quickly and I was advised it'd be ready in 25 minutes. We ordered a basil chicken entree at a 6 and a pad Thai chicken, also at a 6 spice level. Both portions were absolutely ginormous ! The basil chicken was plentifully packed with green beans, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and eggplant. The meal was flavorful and not overly spicy at all. The pad Thai chicken was also flavorful but not spicy.  I tasted a small bite of it and it was the best pad Thai I've had in quite some time! The food was ready when I arrived after 25 minutes so it was great I didn't have to wait. Parking was very easy too although it is street only. I'd love to go back in the future and up my review to five stars once I get a taste of the in house service!"}
{"text":"I must say that I find the few reviews for Nicky's new location to be harsh, so I hope others that have had a good experience like me take to Yelp and post about it, although I think Nicky's is doing just fine by word of mouth with its business. I visited as a party of 5 at around 1pm on a Friday, and the dining room was filled with about 10-12 other parties besides us. The location is great, IMO, because the restaurant options in the immediate area are rather slim. My parents live a short drive from here, so we decided to go here for lunch after my parents enjoyed a previous lunch experience here. 

The building used to be Recipes Remembered, and then it was a potential Chinese restaurant that was never finished. The building had been vacant for a few years and then, one day, Nicky's opened pretty quickly. This was my first time at any of the (now) three locations in Pittsburgh. The patio is beautifully decorated and would be an ideal dining spot on any non-rainy day. The inside, where we sat, is ornately decorated with lots of gold, glittering tapestries, and colorful paintings. There is a room in the back paneled in wood with a bar and a TV. While there was a hostess, we were seated by a friendly woman who ended up being our server. 

A friendly young man brought us waters while we perused the menu. Our server was extremely helpful in assisting my mother with ordering since, due to her shellfish allergy, she cannot have anything with shellfish or products like oyster sauce, which is actually found in more dishes than you would think. She was also helpful when my dad asked for suggestions under the \"chef's special\" section, pointing out the spicier dishes. Soon after she took our orders, everything started to arrive.

 My mom and dad ordered Thai iced teas and really enjoyed them. All of the lunch meals are served with either salad or soup. The soup of the day on this visit was chicken rice. It was flavorful and spicy with plentiful amounts of rice and chicken. It came out hot which was perfect on this cooler day. The salad had a pineapple dressing with crushed peanuts and included tomatoes, cucumbers, mango, pineapple, carrots, and onions. I really enjoyed the sweet dressing and the added crunch/saltiness of the peanuts.

For entrees our table ordered:
1. Wild curry with chicken- this was my meal and I loved it! I ordered a 4 (out of 5) and found it to have a very nice spice to it (cleared my sinuses!) but was not so spicy I ever felt uncomfortable. The dish included a variety of veggies: bamboo shoots, mushrooms, snap peas, red and green peppers, corn, eggplant, green beans, basil leaves, and many herbed spices that provided a delectable flavor profile overall. The chicken was plentiful, and I was more than pleased with the lunch sized portion.

2. Pad thai with chicken- my mom and fiance both ordered this dish, and my mom's was made without oyster sauce and not garnished with the crab rangoon.  My mom ordered at a 3 and she found it to be quite flavorful, the chicken was tender, and she still had leftovers to take home with her. My fiance ordered his at a 4, and thought it was perfect with a kick but not overpowering. He felt the dish was a bit heavy on the purple cabbage in the dish. 

3. Sriracha spicy noodles with chicken-My brother ordered this at a 4 and thought it was flavorful but really spicy, which is what he wanted. He said if anyone orders this be prepared for heavy spice.

4. Pad phet combo-My dad ordered this and it had chicken, beef, pork, and shrimp with wide noodles and a spicy sauce. He ordered a 3 and said it was flavorful and very tasty.

While the food was excellent, the service added to make this a 5 star dining experience! Our server was attentive, friendly, and efficient throughout our meal. The atmosphere here is really nice and we were never rushed even though we had finished eating but were still conversing. The plate presentations are also beautiful, and I loved the little crab rangoon garnish atop the rice (on my plate) or the carrot garnish (on the other plates). I have no complaints about the noise as there was not much of any during our visit even though the dining room was crowded. I did find the lights that were flickering to be slightly distracting, as another reviewer noted. Also, I found it interesting all of the servers and the hostess were wearing phones, presumably because they are all responsible for answering it. While neither of these two things led to a bad experience, they are just something to note. I'd definitely recommend dining in here for the full experience, and I will definitely return upon my subsequent visits to the Burgh."}
{"text":"I'll admit it, I'm a Thai food snob. I partially credit it to the time I spent working at an authentic Vietnamese & Thai restaurant. That experience definitely kicked off my Thai food obsession and now I'm on a venture to find the best Thai in every city I visit. 

I am celebrating a decade in Pittsburgh this year. I can say without a doubt that Nicky's Thai is THE best Thai food in da 'Burgh. Both locations (downtown and north shore) offer high quality, flavorful food and beautiful decor. Neither location is terribly spacious but they do their best to accomodate large groups. My friends and I have squeezed in a table for 12 at the downtown location!  

The service has greatly improved since opening Downtown. It was a little rough in the beginning but I let that slide. I've never had an issue with the North Shore location. I also order Nicky's to go fairly often and they've never missed a beat with the flavor, portion size or estimated time of pick up. 

Let me break down my go to dishes at Nicky's (and almost any Thai restaurant)  Appetizer: Thai summer rolls. These are cold, rice paper wrapped spring rolls and the filling varies slightly depending on the restaurant. Nicky's are served with a peanut dipping sauce and they are fantastic. Fresh and bursting with mint! A+
Entree: Thai curry. I usually go for green but sometimes branch out and try mussuman. I've had both at Nicky's and I was not disappointed. They know how to make a mean curry. Served with either white or brown rice and plenty to take home as leftovers! 

Fair warning to all Thai food enthusiasts: Nicky's doesn't mess around with their spice level. If you order an 8/10, it is not weak. I LOVE spicy food and I've never ordered a 10. 8 has always satisfied my palate. 

I rarely get dessert because I don't have much of a sweet tooth (plus, it's tough to save room for it with the delicious app & entree!) But, if I go for it, I get black sticky rice with mango. It's a filling dish but well worth it. The sticky rice is made with sweet coconut milk and the mango is fresh cut! 

Go to Nicky's Thai. Your tastebuds will thank you."}
{"text":"All you need to know about the North Side location: Outdoor garden delight! 

I've been to this location on Western Ave before but only sat inside or ordered takeout. My date and I had lunch on a Friday and the only seating available was in the garden. It was a chilly day but that didn't stop the Burgh's Thai lovin' crowd! Nicky's also posted up a few standing heaters to keep the patrons warm, if their spicy food didn't do the trick.

Before I got to the restaurant, my date ordered green tea. To our disappointment, it never came. The lunch rush was in it's prime so we opted not to re-order the tea. For starters, we ordered the Tom Yum soup, Thai spring rolls (the cold, non-fried ones,) massaman curry with shrimp and spicy basil noodle with steamed tofu and vegetables. Our spice level ranged from 7 for the Tum Yum soup and curry to an 8 for the spicy basil noodles. I am a huge spicy food fan so I am happy to report that Nicky's got it right this time. I've discovered that it's a hit or a miss with a spicy level of 8 actually being an 8. All of the entrees include either soup or salad. Simple chicken and rice soup and the salad is mixed greens (mostly iceberg, unfortunately) with a tomato, single piece of pineapple, ground peanuts & sweet ginger dressing. Along with the spicy level being on point, our food was delicious. I have never had a bad meal from Nicky's! The portion sizes are enough for two meals. I love that patrons can really get their money's worth at Nicky's :) 

Our service wasn't the best but with the mass of people there for lunch, I didn't make the less than attentive service an issue.

If you head over for lunch, keep in mind that this place gets very busy. It IS worth the wait, especially the outdoor garden!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here while visiting from NYC. We loved it so much, we returned the next day.

The decor is unique and classy, with a lot of Asian-themed gold and bejeweled items adorning the walls. The interior is relaxed, clean, and comfortable. We were able to charge our phones.

Service is friendly and prompt.
 
The portions are heaping and generous. I had trouble finishing my meal!

On both visits, I had the beef Pad Phet. I had it made to spicy level 8 the first time, and 7 the second time. I have a very high tolerance for spicy food and still found it to be quite spicy, so keep this in mind if you are sensitive to spicy food!

My boyfriend had the Glass Noodle salad on our first visit and raved about it. On our second visit, he had the Pepper Steak special, which I sampled. It was better than any pepper steak dish I had ever eaten, and it comes with a fried egg on top. It was cooked to the lowest spiciness level (4), but was not anything most people can't handle. 

Their wine selection is basic, which is not an issue for me, because I found that their white wines are drinkable and simple - most people who already like white wine would probably find them enjoyable.

They also have a selection of liquor. I am not sure what beers they carry.

I can say with certainty that if and when we return to Pittsburgh, we will be eating here again! The place fills up fast for dinner, so I recommend arriving right as they are opening at 5 PM."}
{"text":"Four stars for seating us on a Sunday without a reservation, for serving us quickly, and the nice decor. Also, the price was right (around thirty dollars for an appetizer and an entree, the latter of which yielded leftovers). My husband got the tiger cry beef salad, which despite its name does not involve any tears. This came with sticky rice and a Thai vinegrette and was enough to fill him up. Minus one star for my 1/5 spicy green vegetable curry being almost too hot to eat. I just finished the leftovers, and they were really rather uncomfortable for such a low spice level. Many people we know say Nicky's has the best Thai food in town, but I will only go back if I can find something on the menu I like that leaves my taste buds intact."}
{"text":"1. The food is delicious, top notch.  I ordered the massaman curry and a Thai ice tea, and I highly recommend both.  The curry is already spicy, but they will ask if you want it served spicier, perfect for those of you who like love spice and don't have stomach issues

2.  Service was on point!  Food was delivered quickly, and I was checked on several tines, but not in a pushy way at all

3.  Presentation of the food was among the best I've seen. 

4.  Ambiance was very nice, decorations and setting were simple and in good taste.  Good for individuals, families, dates, etc.  

5.  BYOB

6. Go there!!  Totally worth, will be back next time I'm in Pitt."}
{"text":"Hands down I would say this is the best Thai food in the city of Pittsburgh and probably surrounding areas and maybe a biased opinion but they have really good food.

I like to warn people who go to the location in downtown Pittsburgh the place opens at 11:30 be there at that time if you come later it's kind of odd but you have to watch other people eat while you stand in line for your turn to sit down.

There are other locations there's a location on the North side and there is a location in the North Hills of Pittsburgh the location North Hills of Pittsburgh is a larger location so less stability as the city.

I love this place it's been awhile since I've been there I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"This was our second time visiting and the food, once again did not disappoint! Absolutely the best Thai food I've had- and I tend to try Thai food wherever I travel to. 

The Veggies 4 You appetizer is huge and delicious. I'd get the spring rolls on their own as a lunch bc they're that good! The pad Thai is flavorful- I'd recommend getting at least a 3 as spice level (though be warned that last time, I got a 5 and almost cried...but kept eating bc it was so good). The massaman curry was delightful- a wonderful peanutty, coconutty dish. 

Looking forward to our next visit here!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and the atmosphere is warm and comfy.  My only issue is that the the waitstaff will serve you at random.  One guy for drinks, one person for food, one to bring the check etc.  It gets a little hectic and unorganized.  Peace!"}
{"text":"Had to wait till it opened at 5 pm, but it's worth the wait! After I ordered the food, it came within 10 minutes and totally met my expectation!
I ordered Gaprow Lad Kao with pork and spicy level 6. It came with two fried eggs crispy on the outside and little running in the inside. Perfect Asian way of making fried egg! The dish came with enough veggies, Basil, and the presentation is very good. Flavor was good but not too heavy. 
Service was attentive and good as well. I asked for water with no ice and the whole time they remembered. The ambiance is very classy. Good for dates or just coming for food. 
Wish I could eat more. Will certainly return!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try Thai,  saw the great reviews here on yelp and love it! Really great food! Great prices!  Attentive staff."}
{"text":"Tried multiple curries, noodles, and entrees between this location and the one downtown. Dishes very flavorful, reasonably priced, and filling. My favorite so far has been the duck curry.

Atmosphere is versatile- good for casual dinner or more special occasion.

Would come back for curry, but go elsewhere for noodles."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a 4.5 but a 5 will do. This is a cozy little place in downtown Pittsburgh. I've never had vegan duck before but was intrigued. The curry sauce was excellent with peas, corn, carrots, etc. The soy duck had an interesting taste. Not that I loved it but certainly didn't hate it. I would get it again. 

Adding to the excellent food was excellent service. My water glass never went dry. 

I will certainly return."}
{"text":"One of my fave's,  my last visit was not as good as usual,  so I am going for 4 stars. I will visit again soon and hope to bump this back up to 5 stars!
*They are conscious of gluten free adjustments, which is a big plus in my book!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff & delicious food :) We visited with friends on one fine night after visiting Pittsburgh and returning back to Philadelphia. Its a small place and gets crowded. Samosas, Panang Curry, Red Curry, Green Curry, Drunken Noodles, almost everything on the menu was amazing.  Nice drinks too!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous decor, super chill music. I feel like I should be at the spa lol. I really enjoyed the pork shu mai, but their prices are way off base. I don't know what it is about downtown, that they charge so very much, I guess because rent prices are higher? I doubt we will be back, as I've had similar food for much less elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food was good and flavorful. I'd come back next time we are visiting the city"}
{"text":"Best thai food in the Greater Pittsburgh Area! Their noodle dishes are just so flavorful and the red curry is delicious.  I also had the jalapeño chicken and the peanut chicken and the ginger chicken from the entrees and they all just busted with flavor.  Their spicy is very spicy if that's what you're into and their mild is just as flavorful without the extra spice."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Service and presentation was really good. 
Ordered the chicken with cashew nut stir fry and the boyfriend ordered the Panang curry. We also got the vegetable4u entree! Would recommend everything!"}
{"text":"Had the Crab Rangoon (great!) and Pad Thai (spice level 7). Really good! The dining room is kind of an awkward layout, but the food and service were top notch. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once for take out and once dine in. We've ordered the pad tai, spicy fish and beans, and another fish dish I can't remember. The flavors were good overall, but the dishes were incredibly salty. My friend and I had to split the rice bowl and neither of us could fully appreciate meal because of the salt load (think numb on your tongue). I had asked the waitress before I ordered if they could make the pad tai less salty, and she told me they did not add salt so the only thing they could do was completely take out the fish sauce. I did not want an entire ingredient left out, so I just left it as is. Gave the place two tries, will probably not be back."}
{"text":"We were excited to try Nicky's out upon recommendation from others. Unfortunately, tonight was not our night. This is a negative review, not just because of some poor service and sub-par food, but because we felt an overall lack of care from multiple people on multiple occasions throughout our visit. Many other fellow diners seemed to be having a great time and this made us more uncomfortable.

We arrived at 5:30 and were told we would have to vacate by 6:30. No problem, we were going to a Pirates game at 7p anyway! To be fair, it was quite busy. However, the wait staff seemed to rush us to the point of brusqueness. We ordered promptly and received our appetizer shortly thereafter. We then waited for 45 minutes while at least 8 new, and larger, groups arrived, ordered, and received their appetizers and entrees. Around 6:15 we asked the hostess if we'd still have to be out by 6:30. Since we still did not have our food, we were told we could stay. A few minutes later we were asked to move to a different table so a new couple could come and take ours. After an hour of watching other groups arrive and get their food, we were planning to ask for out check and leave without our entrees when our food was deposited on our table without any apology. The food was cold and regrettably not very good. Mine in particular appeared as if it was hastily prepared and then left to sit for awhile. We had to eat quickly and were still billed the full amount. We could have eaten at PNC Park for less! Multiple dropped balls and missed opportunities made this a very bad experience."}
{"text":"I've heard from many people that Nicky's Thai was the best Thai in the Pittsburgh area but I would have to disagree. I've tried Nicky's Thai 3 separate times and each time I was never as impressed with Nicky's as I was with Noodlehead. My first visit I got the pad Thai and I wasn't a huge fan. It smells and tastes like it has an overwhelming amount of fish sauce on it. The second time I tried a noodle dish that was supposed to have a sauce on it but my noodles tasted like they had been drying out for an hour on their back counter. I tasted no sauce whatsoever on it. I will say that their side salad that comes with the lunch entree was very good. 

As for the decor this restaurant is beautiful. I love looking at all of the decor hanging up around the restaurant. The only complaint about the environment is that they squeezed too many tables into the restaurant. Each time I eat there I struggle to get out from my table without hitting the people at the table next to me. I am not large by any means so this is something they should probably work on."}
{"text":"As mentioned in my review of the downtown location, I have never been much of a fan of Nicky's Thai. I think it is overrated and definitely not the best Thai in our area. However, I will say that I had a much better experience at the North Side location. We started the meal with the Thai toast which I would highly recommend. The pairing with the dipping sauce is a great combo and it has so much flavor. 

As my entree I got the Pad See Eaw and it had the perfect amount of sauce. It wasn't swimming and it wasn't lacking in sauce like some other dishes I've had there. 

In comparison to the other location I think this location is set up a little better with more room between tables. I don't feel like I'm eating dinner with the people next to me or like I'm going to elbow them as I try to leave my table. The waiter was also very nice and didn't bother us when we sat for a while to finish our bottle of wine which was nice."}
{"text":"From this location, I've only ever ordered delivery through Postmates. The portions are decent for the price. I did get lunch with a salad once and they put the salad in the same bag as the food so I ate a hot salad."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of the outdoor patio! Great food and staff! Crab Rangoons and Spicy Noodles are to die for."}
{"text":"Third time's the charm! Took my mom who has never had Thai, and she LOVED it! Her fave was the fresh spring rolls. They are some of the best I've had, great size, yummy peanut sauce! The waiter was super sweet and friendly and recommended a dish for my mom to order... Basil something, with chicken and rice. I forget the name, but it's one of the specialties. She was ballsy though and ordered it a bit too hot even though the waiter warned her... The dish started at a 2 or 3. I of course got the pumpkin tofu curry AGAIN (I have issues) and it was a home run. Great amount of pumpkin, tofu, all mixed in the lovely coconut-y sauce. Heaven. This is my new favorite place to take people!"}
{"text":"Great curry and staff! was able to get us in last minute! I love any type of asian food! YUMMY"}
{"text":"I really like Nicky's. It definitely ranks up there with some of my favorite thai places. They do my favorites well, red curry and pad thai, so I'm a fan. I haven't tried a large variety of their menu because of this, but I have a feeling they do everything pretty well."}
{"text":"The place was so loud and lights were so dimmed, I don't know which one made me run out of there."}
{"text":"Nicky's needs to rename their \"vegetarian\" section to \"pescatarian.\" Everything on the menu contains either fish or oyster sauce. Not only is this frustrating for vegetarians/vegans, it could cause someone allergic to take a trip to the hospital.  We also waited 20 minutes from paying for the food to getting our credit card back. I finally had to walk up to the front and ask for it back. I would give one star but I added one back because we asked for a manager, who was helpful in finding us something to eat (we had to choose from a few options, none of which were on the vegetarian menu, and ask specifically for no fish/oyster sauce). Another waiter came over and said he heard we were vegan and was also extremely helpful, as he was also vegetarian. The food was delicious in the end and the atmosphere was great."}
{"text":"5 star food is not necessarily the best of everything combined in perfect harmony, better than any food we've ever had.  Instead, I think it is when a restaurant does everything right, like Nicky's.  Duck perfectly cooked and seasoned, service wonderful, spring roles well flavoured and perfectly presented, Thai iced tea full of tasty goodness, and prices rock-bottom in the middle of the city.  Lovely ambiance - an oasis of calm in the heart of downtown.  I count myself lucky to have visited."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend here on a busy Saturday afternoon for lunch. Swan Lake was playing and the place was buzzing, but I was able to snag a table pretty quickly. Needing to be warmed up I ordered a flower tea and a bowl of Tom Kha soup with chicken while I waited for my friend to arrive. The tea seemed already sweetened, which was fine with me, and the soup was in a way bigger bowl than I expected and was absolute coconut creamy goodness. 

My main entree was the Thai fried rice with crab. I sampled this dish a few years ago at the Northside location and loved it. What I had today wasn't bad, just not nearly as good as I remembered it. I would get it as a side dish, but not my main dish. Don't get me wrong, it was good! Just not out of thing world and not something I'd want a whole plate of again. 

The place was beautifully decorated, and the service seemed a bit scattered, but food was pumping out of that kitchen quickly even with a full restaurant. The lunch portions were extremely reasonable for the price ($9-$12 per entree at a fancy downtown spot) and tasty. My friend liked her sliced beef salad but said it wasn't filling. Docking one star for scattered and unorganized service. Though very friendly, our waitress didn't seem to be very experienced or quick, and split our checks wrong. 

Oh! Even though this place is prob twice the size of the Northside location, they still crammed in about three tables too many. When you factor in the chairs because they use no booths, things get can get cozy REAL quick!!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. To go orders have large quantities so beware when ordering for a small group not to over order. Love their red curry!"}
{"text":"Well, I guess take-out is out of the question. I called at 11:32am to put in an order for takeout and was told \"It will be ready in 30 minutes\". At exactly noon I was there at the door ready to get my order but there was a line, out the door, for takeout orders. After waiting 25 minutes out in the cold and seeing ONE person get their takeout order in all that time I left. I could actually see my name on an order sitting there behind the desk but they didn't have a single person actually giving people their food. The one guy who did get his food only did so by harassing the hostess to give him his order already. Since I didn't feel like screaming and stamping my feet I went back to my desk where a protein bar awaits as a really cruddy substitute for my thai lunch. Even had I gotten it eventually it would have been cold and soggy after sitting around. Nicky's does realize that they are downtown and catering to working people who have very limited lunch breaks, right? The real nerve is that they did have time to call me later and yell at me for not paying for my food. Well, if you won't give me my food how can I possibly pay for it?"}
{"text":"I love this place. 

I've tried a few things here, and I've loved basically everything. I went there last night and waited for 45 minutes for a table. The hostess came out and apologized every 10 minutes, despite having already told us that we'd wait for around 30 minutes, which I thought was pretty wonderful service. 

After being seated, she gave our group some complimentary Crab Rangoon for the wait. She asked us to order, we got another appetizer, and the food was out very quickly after finishing our 2nd appetizer. 

I had the Pumpkin Curry, and it was delicious, and a lot of food. I brought it home the next day and ate it for lunch, and it was still so delicious. 

I'm excited to go back to this place. I'm excited to try as much of their food as I can."}
{"text":"My husband and I were up for some thai food after a long day, so we decided to go to Nicky's at Penn Ave. 
The service was amazing from the word go and the food was even better. 
We ordered ginger tofu and hung lay with vegetables. 

They were both really well served and the taste was right at the spice level we wanted - 7 

We recommend this to all the thai lovers and good food seekers."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and I have never been disappointed by the food here! While it isn't my favorite thai restaurant in Pittsburgh, it is still an amazing restaurant. It's great as a quick, midday lunch or even as a nice dinner date on the weekend. 

I'm not sure if it's on the menu but my favorite dishes here were the curries (I believe one of my favorites had chunks of mango in it) and the fried rice. One of my fav fried rice dishes here was the crab fried rice but I don't see it on the menu anymore. 

I loved the downtown location and how it's an easy walk to other places on Penn Ave."}
{"text":"I was recommended this place by a Yinzer I used to work with.  He is a foodie and beer connoisseur.  Since I'm not from the Burgh it has taken me a long time to get out there.  So I finally was able to take another Yinzer friend of mine for his birthday when I made an impromptu surprise visit.  I am so glad that we went.  It was raining and dismal.  We walked in and they asked if we would like to be inside or outside.  Anyone who knows me knows that I will choose outside 100% of the time when it is gorgeous outside.  I look at her and say it's raining.  Is it covered?  She said it was covered.  Sold!!  That choice was simple.  What a beautiful patio.  Serene is the best way to explain it.  You could hear the rain drops on the roof.  So nice.  Calming.  There was a fountain in the middle of the room and plants and statues everywhere.  

Onto Service.  Our server was V.  I say like Vee and she said nope just V like as in victory or vendetta...hmmm this is going to be an interesting meal.  I am a server and I can appreciate her wittiness.  She comes across dead pan serious when she is talking to you but with the things she is saying you can understand that she is intelligent and knowledgeable.  What is not to love!!  We find out that she is studying for some god awful intelligent subject.  She is destined to make some difference in the world.  She did a fabulous job and I hope that she will be there when I visit the next time.

So we look at the menu and it is vast...all the options are represented.  My buddy is a Pescatarian.  So his options are limited.  I am thankful that my options are limitless.  However, I do have to concede on a few things if we are to share an appetizer.  Oh well...I'll make due.  We choose a dish I believe is called Veg for You or something like that.  It is like a sampler of sorts.  It had the Fresh Spring Rolls, Somosa, and another item I just can't place right now.  But everything was delish.  I would easily get that again.  I also order the Shrimp Cakes.  After all it is his birthday so let's Fish it up.

Onto the main course.  A dish catches my eye not for me but in general because of the name and the location on the menu.  I know that my buddy would probably enjoy this dish if it fits his dietary requirements.  So when V comes back we ask what exactly is the Vegan Duck Curry.  Completely serious she says that they feed the duck only vegetables for 12 months and then waits for the response.  Wow...funny!  She says she is kidding and explains that it is a vegetarian protein...yada yada yada.  So he chooses that and because I want to try something new I ask for suggestions.  She gave me three and I settle with the Garprow Lad Kao (I just called them to find out the name since it is not on the online menu).  Say that 3 times fast.  It had two cooked over easy eggs on top.  She asks both of us the level of heat we would like to have 1-5.  5 would be the typical Thai Hot that I am used to.  I usually get that and then ask for more powder to up the level of heat.  V then says Thai Hot?  No refunds?  Now that gives me Pause to think.  I have been to several places and gotten Thai Hot.  I have always added more heat at the end...Can this place be so hot that they are like No refunds?  What do I do?  I say what the heck!  If it is too hot then I deserve that.  I order Thai Hot and she also gets us the Sauce tray.  Why not right?  Everything was so good.  The sauce tray was a nice added touch and I did still add some more heat.  I found out that she could have done a 6 Level of Heat!  Maybe on my next trip.  

Now it is time to find out if I can surprise my bestie with a Birthday embarrassment.  It would only be the second time this weekend.  V is more then happy to oblige.  She comes out with a nice Pumpkin Curd and a candle and of course we sing and embarrass him.  The curd was also amazing like the rest of the experience.  Thank you V for helping me make this time special.  Thank you Nikki's Thai Kitchen for just having the right atmosphere and food to match.  Anyone who is planning a trip to the Burgh make sure you add this to your visit itinerary...ask for V she is delightful."}
{"text":"First time here. It was really good. Small crowded place. Decor is awesome. We had as an appetizer fresh spring rolls and crispy egg roll. Both delicious, fresh spring rolls are in are rapped with rice paper and have a price of tofu in the middle with the vegetables. I'm not big on tofu but the spring rolls are good. Look like sushi when they bring it out. The crispy egg rolls were amazing as well very skinny and small. 
Dinner we all ordered but shared because the portions I think are generous. First yellow curry which is almost like a stew. I was hesitate to try but was delicious tasted like a home cooked meal over rice. Can't go wrong with phad Thai so we got that at a 3 spice level. I would get a little spicer next time. It was really good I love Phad Thai. The server suggested the shittake duck. The mushrooms were awesome first time I had duck it was good. sauce was awesome. Also had spicy green bean with shrimp those are amazing at a spice level 5.
Overall good place but pricy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants in the city. The service is great, the food is delicious and the atmosphere is fun. I've been there for lunch and dinner and both times are great times to go."}
{"text":"Good Thai. Extremely spicy, and I would not order above a Level 1, personally - I would usually order \"medium\" buffalo wings anywhere o go, for reference. I like their crab Rangoons, and everything that we have gotten there has been solid. The takeout time on a Friday or Saturday night can be very long."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of Thai food and Nikky's did not disappoint! From the elegant decor and atmosphere to the cocktails and absolutely delicious food, Nikky's delivered and I can't wait to eat here again. 

We started with the Crab Rangoon which was delicious as long as you like cream cheese which I do. Also, the coconut Mojito was delightful! A little pricey at $10 but definitely a good Mojito and I really wanted two! My favorite Thai entree is always red curry with tofu and extra vegetables. My request was accommodated with a few extra dollars for the extra veggies. Spice level is 3-10. Three here is basically not spicy at all. I've had up to 7 which was spicy but not too spicy for me (I like medium spice level usually). Food is served in fun \"gold\" dishes and flatware. I LOVE coconut rice. It might sound weird to those who haven't had it but you must try it once! I haven't had it with the mango here, only the ice cream which is amazing! 

Staff had always been polite and service quick even when they are busy. Prices about $10-15 per entree. Parking is on the street or nearby lots. 

Can't want to eat here again!"}
{"text":"First time in pittsburg and we decided to try this thai place based on the reviews. It was one of the best thai food places i have ever been to. Their service was amazing as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Service seemed to be pretty good and the restaurant overall was clean and comfortable.  I started out with the fresh spring rolls.  They're a little different at this restaurant...vegetarian using tofu in lieu of shrimp and crab.  Somewhat dry and tasteless.  Then I had the seafood Tum Yum soup.  It was ok, again not the best I've had...somewhat salty and lacked some of the typical flavors I've had at other Thai restaurants, i.e. Light on the lime juice and too heavy on the fish sauce.  Finally, I had the grilled Squid...not very good at all...overlooked, not much of it and unimpressive dressing.  Sorry folks...not very impressed with this place."}
{"text":"Nicky's Thai Kitchen was truly a great experience. I was really surprised with everything here, and did not expect such an experience. 

I had heard about this place once or twice and was all about going. I ventured over with two friends (one who has been there before) It was a stormy summer Pittsburgh night, but he insisted that we sit outside, which was fine with me!  We got there around 5:45 on a Monday evening so it wasn't busy at all. We walked out through a small dim lighted dining room then out to the patio, which was beautiful little oasis. Filled with plants and Buddhas. It was actually the perfect environment to sit outside during a storm. There were about 20 different colored/patterned umbrellas covering the patio, which made it all the more charming.

The service was good, and the waitress was patient with us while we decided what we wanted. She also carried food outside while it was raining (the patio was completely covered by umbrellas so she didn't get wet at all!) But nonetheless we tipped her well! 

My friend & I ordered the Grilled mint Beef Salad & Pumpkin Curry with pork to split. I could not pass up either of these entrees! The waitress asked us how spicy we wanted it, and we said very spicy. 

The Beef salad was first, and might I add it came out rather quickly. It was a refreshing combination of tender beef, lettuce, red onions, tomatoes, cucumbers, cilantro, mint, and a spicy Thai chili sauce. It was an excellent array of flavors in my opinion. Although, I can't say I've ever had a similar dish, so it was easy to impress me.

Next was the Pumpkin Curry. I've had pumpkin curry one other time and it was good, but this blew me away. Soft nibblets of Asian pumpkin, basil, coconut milk, and a spicy red curry. It was a good level of spice for me, but I'm assuming they brought us the spiciest level, I would expect a little more for 'the spiciest level' though.

I also ordered a Thai iced tea, sweet & refreshing. It is BYOB, which we didn't know. Next time we will bring our own bottle of wine for sure!

I gave this place 5 stars ( I am easily impress though) The food was excellent, I left there completely satisfied, Service was friendly & quick, the outdoor seat was perfect! If you go there definitely request a table outside, even if it's raining. Honestly the stormy atmosphere made it more enjoyable, for me at least! And all for just under $25, you can't go wrong. All the curries were $12.50, usually good curry is around $14 so I was super impressed by this."}
{"text":"Solid meal well-prepared. I enjoyed a mild scallop dish with excellent coconut milk, potato, pineapple sauce. My colleagues had a duck dish (very good), red snapper (ditto), and a vegetarian dish that was FAR too spicy. 

In general the spice levels seemed uneven given that three of four people ordered \"medium\". (I ordered mild and  mine was in fact mild.)

Service was not super fast, but not problematically slow. Cheerful server, very flexible and willing to put the check on two credit cards. I would go back!"}
{"text":"Yum! Came here for a date night with the huz and I'm so glad we did. The place itself has a cozy atmosphere perfect for an intimate dinner with your partner, close friends or even parents. Good thing there was no wait (we were starving) and our waiter was on point with everything. The food was delicious and if it didn't take us so long to get here, I would make this our regular Thai place! So much flavor and taste that we left super full because we couldn't stop eating. Love it."}
{"text":"The food was perfectly spiced and wonderfully flavorful. It felt so good to have AWESOME thai food again. I loved the intimacy of the restaurant and the other patrons seemed to genuinely enjoy themselves too. The only reason I am giving it three stars and not four is because the service was astonishingly terrible. There were only three other couples dining and it was really really strange how our waitress wouldn't look in our direction or come over to our table to see if we needed anything. When she finally did come over she apologized with a laugh but then continued to act the same for the duration of our dinner. My boo eventually got up and went to the kitchen and asked for a refill on my soda. Judging by the other reviews this is not the norm, but I was extremely disappointed. 

I will be back though, everything else was great."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from Face Book, which listed (the Western Ave. location) as one of the 10 best unknown restaurants in Pittsburgh. Since we were going to the theater, we decided to try out this one on Penn Ave. and we were not disappointed in the least. Since we were on a tight schedule, I made reservations for Friday night at 6:30 about 1:00 that afternoon. They were able to accommodate us and even though we arrived about 10 minutes late due to heavy traffic, they seated us immediately. Which was great since there was a line out the door when we arrived! I guess some others read that FB page too! I highly recommend making a reservation on a weekend night!
After being seated, we did wait about 10 minutes for a waiter to come by. But they were crazy busy and turning tables over as fast as they could. We ordered a  couple of speciality drinks and placed our order for Spring Rolls and one Pad Thai, which we shared. So glad we did,  cause when it came, it was huge!
Our drinks were brought with the appetizer. My Dirty Thai Martini was really good. A bit different with basil stuffed olives, but delicious just the same. The Spring rolls were fantastic. So fresh and a nice dipping sauce with lots of carrots and red cabbage on the plate.
Then the Pad Thai came. Ours was made with chicken and my friend who moved here from Chicago said it was the best she has had since she moved. One of the best I have had as well.
Even after arriving late and waiting for our initial contact with the waiter, we were able to get out the door on time as they must be cranking out the food from that kitchen at an unbelievable pace. Not just fast,  but beautifully presented and delicious.
I won't comment on the decor as others have. It's a Thai restaurant and pretty much what I would expect. The tables were very close together and the noise level was fairly high. But you could talk easily to your dinner partner without shouting. 
I definitely want to go back and try some other dishes,  but I think I would be fun to go in a group of 4-6 and order dishes to share so we can try more things. I grabbed a take out menu on the way out the door so I can study it before the next visit. I hope it happens soon!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Pittsburgh in the nothside location two month ago and caught wind of a fabulous Thai resturant on western ave not far from where i live. I must say its the best thai food I have ever eaten! The servers where kind, the out door patio is breath taking as if I where actually in thai land myself and the food was exquisite! From the day i moved here i have been crazy for their food. I highly recommend you vist them."}
{"text":"Hmmmm...I'd heard so much about Nicky's Thai Kitchen, but never got to the Northside location, that I jumped on the opportunity to hit their new downtown location.  I have to say, the food was everything I'd heard it was.  Flavorful, fresh, beautifully prepared and perfectly delicious.  Clearly Nicky's knows how make their dining customers happy when it comes to Thai cuisine.  A solid 4 stars there definitely. And they are definitely gluten-free friendly...big plus there.

My standard for Thai is always Green Curry.  This time I ordered it with chicken.  Big pieces of soft eggplant, crisp snowpeas, al dente green beans, peas, carrots, big pieces of broccoli enveloped in a sweet and hot (I ordered it HOT) green curry kissed with coconut satisfied every expectation I have of that lovely dish.  It came with a choice of soup or salad.  Salad it was.  Iceberg lettuce was graced with a pineapple peanut dressing that I think I could put on everything and be happy.  It was beautiful.  That is, when it finally arrived at the table.  Let me detail the lowlights of the visit.

The service is abysmal.  Does it sound like I'm overstating how bad it was?  Nope.  The three of us waited and waited until finally we stopped a server to ask where the salads were.  Immediately the salads appeared on the table.  Were they waiting at the pass simply to be picked up and delivered?  

Entrees?  Same slooooooooowwwww experience, but with a new twist.  After an extended time my dining companions got their entrees.  The assumption was made that mine would arrive next.  And it did....10-15 minutes later and only after (again) asking the server.  Some major improvements need to be made in the service area.  Do they need more than 2 servers?  You betcha!  The place was crammed with diners!  There were potential diners out the door waiting for tables to open up.  

Unfortunately, the service doesn't come close to the food.  I'm hoping it's just a matter of finding their sea legs and the service issues will clear themselves up quickly.  If not, those lines out the door will disappear quickly...downtown diners mostly have a lunch HOUR to abide by.  PLEASE, Nicky's, let the service match the quality of the food soon.  The only reason there are 3 stars instead of 2 is because the food is SO blasted good! Fingers crossed that next time the review will be stellar for BOTH!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice. The first time was about a year back and we loved the curries. We had a chance to visit this place a couple of days back. We ordered the Fresh Spring Rolls, Tom Yum Soup and Pad Thai. The Fresh Spring Rolls were great. I did not care for the Pad Thai and the soup so much. It was flavorful and did not appeal to me. 
It's a good spot with great ambiance."}
{"text":"Let me start with this: I spend a few days in Thailand and Nicky's food holds its own. Nicky's curries, noodles dishes, salads, and stir fries are all delicious. I highly recommend their lunch special that includes a refreshing salad and a single crab rangoon. The massaman and yellow curries are my go to, but I've started to really enjoy the spicy mint beef salad. The tom yum soup for the table with the flaming bowl is pretty neat (and tasty).

When ordering, keep in mind that they aren't kidding about spice levels so anything above a 7/10 is sure to burn at least a little. The services has always been solid. They have very small water glasses, but they are very attentive and make sure they're nearly always full."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options. Lovely outdoor space. BYOB. Weekend reservations a MUST!"}
{"text":"If I could rate this place a zero, I would. They can never get my food correct whenever I go there. If I order something spicy but at a bare minimum level, they magically make it the hottest level possible. It's quite frankly annoying, especially me only going there 3 times."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the authenticity of Nicky's, but the food is consistently delicious and the service is efficient and pleasant. Pad See Ew is a great cold weather dish, and the patio is perfect for summer nights."}
{"text":"Bad info on Yep site regarding hours. Checked hours and drove down here only to find out they were closed!  Update your info Nicky's!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints.  I usually dine at the North Side restaurant but recently had take out from this location.   I agree with another reviewer that the spice level could have been slightly higher but to each is own.  I would recommend asking for spices on the side if you prefer your meals on the spicy side.   Great take out size portions.  Perfect for sharing!"}
{"text":"It's a shame I had to give this place a three because the food is good. It taste like what you expect Thai to be and fresh. But the service was not great.

We came here on a Saturday night busy at 7pm. We made reservations and that is suggested because of the size of the restaurant.

The website offers BYOB. It says there is a $5 cork fee for the north side location and $10 for downtown. The waiter said that there isn't BYOB downtown so this was misleading. 

Our waiter was not attentive or friendly. I asked him what the best curry was and he just goes \"I don't know whatever you like\" ummm ok. No. He also messed up my friends meal and didn't put in her appetizer at all and she got her food last. He never came by to check on us and the food runner was more attentive then our waiter. O and he also messed up the check. It took super long to get it corrected. 

As far as the food, the fresh spring rolls were good. Filling as well. They could easily be a meal for someone who doesn't have a robust appetite like I do. The presentation was great too. Very nice decor in the restaurant but it's pretty loud. Might be good for a first date, because there won't be any awkward silence since you can't hear each other anyway. 

I also ordered the panang curry medium. The sauce was great but it wasn't too spicy. I would have gotten it stronger by personal preference. It's too bad the service wasn't great because I would eat here again based on the food. Maybe I will try the other location."}
{"text":"I was hoping for good Thai food in Pittsburgh, but I didn't think the food here is really good. The pork schu mai's were just ok, I think if they added some crab or shrimp in there, it would be a lot better. The Beef Noodle Soup, which is basically their Boat Noodle (I guess Pittsburgh people don't know Boat Noodle) was really flavorless compared to real Boat Noodle. The staff, however, gave great service and were really nice, so this review is based on just the food and not the staff."}
{"text":"I like it here, the food is really good. I like that you can have alcohol at this one. They don't have it on western ave. I enjoy the Pad Thai but make sure you go very low on the spice if you can't take the heat. I am not about that spice life. The crab cheese wontons are really good too!!!!!"}
{"text":"I loooove eating Pad Thai and it was pretty decent here. I really enjoyed the crab rangoons; you have to try that if nothing else. I'd check it out again."}
{"text":"First of all I want to point out I don't know Thai food very well.  Ok not at all. I looked it up on yelp after a friend told me to come. The reviews were soso but he told me that he was picky and To try it. So I did. The place is small, a bit loud but very nice. I ordered the soup chicken Tom kha and omg it was so good. If i didn't order the main i would just had 3 more of the soup. Then I had the chicken black. That was soso. The fried wonton on it was cold. Then the sauce was way to runny.  Felt like another soup. Plus the mushrooms and garlic was not cook.  Before I was done they brought the check and kinda rushed me to pay as she came 3 time to ask Are you ready sir. All and all was good and very affordable."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places, ever! I went to Nicky's on Western Ave a few months ago for my birthday. The place is pretty small but very cute, a calm and pretty ambience for dinner. The waiter we had was very nice and knowledgeable. The food was great! The curries, rice, and noodles we ordered were all very good. The Thai Iced Tea hit the spot. Overall, no real complaints and I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Smiling Banana Leaf has some competition for best thai in this town ...

Admittedly, the first time I ordered from here I wasn't impressed (that seems to happen to me a lot?). I ordered the green curry with tofu, spice level 3. Yeah, I was being wimpy as I wasn't sure of how they handled their spices. It just tasted so very bland. I was a little disappointed as I had heard so many people call them the best thai in town.

Round 2: since I work in north side three days a week my immediate options are rather limited. Fast food or a handful of other places, most of which I do not want to visit. I decided Nicky's deserves another try. I ordered the same lunch entree, but this time spice level 6. Whenever I'm giving a restaurant another try I also reorder the same thing (unless I found it to be really disgusting) to see if maybe they were just having an off day or I really don't like it. This time it tasted absolutely phenomenal! I still should kick the spice level up to a 7 or 8, but I was pretty happy with what they did.

I've only ever done take-out so I can't speak to the waiters/waitresses, but the front of house people have been fantastic both times. Very nice and welcoming. Sitting and waiting for my food, I've noticed that they treat each person who walks in very well. Gotta love service with a smile. :D"}
{"text":"Winner Winner REAL Thai Dinner.

Anybody who has had authentic Thai can attest to the fact that Nicky's is hands down Pittsburgh's most authentic Thai food.

Don't be swayed by the entrance or the shady North Side around it Nicky's is a diamond in the ruff.

Nicky's does it right. What is right? Well ultimately it's subjective but my opinion matters damnit. Sooo soak this in. BYOB to begin with bottle and corking fees on the weekend, but completely reasonable and not at all minded.(.25 a bottle for beer, not sure for wine)

AMBIENCE: Their outdoor seating area takes you outside \"the city\" and transports you to Phuket island...Not really. But its a lovely little atmosphere perfect for dates and what not, but certainly no good if it's a hot afternoon(in which case you should stay inside where it is air conditioned) It really does have nice ambience with water features and thai-ish decor.

APPS: Now the important stuff. Apps are great. Crab Rangoon, Crunchy Spring rolls papaya salad. All perfect and not all that expensive. Each cooked to perfection and with the flavor and taste you ultimately are looking for in a good app with actual thai roots. Their chicken noodle soup is also delightful and garlicy with flat rice noodles. A nice twist on an otherwise 'american' soup.

MAIN: For the main dish the Red, Green, Yellow blue whatever curries(had them all) are ALL great. Chicken, beef, shrimp or seafood you can't go wrong. The complex spices of indian cuisine collide in a blissful manor with the far east as Thai food is expected to do and you are presented with a delightful filling and delicious dish. Their spice scale is as you should expect and they are darn good and gauging how spicy you want something. Their \"brown\" rice is beautiful and purple and beautifully presented so don't be alarmed when you ask for brown and it comes out purple.

Drinks: Well you can bring your own alcoholic beverages but their thai iced tea and iced coffee are made the real way, the way they do in Thailand and for a reasonable price since you'll want to have two most likely.

Overall: GO HERE! it's great for dates and good for familys. The staff is friendly and forgiving of indecisiveness and alterations to your specifications. Compliments to the chef and Nicky for opening a great authentic Thai food restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Chili scallops sweet and sour flavor. Very yummy the the sauce is really creamy yet very flavorful. Definitely go there again

Pineapple fried rice both are flavorful and awesome I had brown rice. It's is very well-cooked"}
{"text":"Food was good but a little too spicy for the medium spice level. Not as fresh as I'd like today, but I've been here before when it was better. Had tofu eggplant basil which a little oily. Place was packed for lunch and very LOUD. Table setting is very cramped. Would come back. Hopefully better next time."}
{"text":"A staple of my visits to Pittsburgh. Lucky to travel solo as tables can be harder to come by. Friendly staff, quick service and delicious food. Highly recommend the Pad See Ew."}
{"text":"Please be aware...the Sunday hours on wrong on this site!  They do not open at 4:00.....but rather 5:00 (which is silly for a Sunday when people have time to go out). Made arrangements and had the visit timed perfectly ...for 4:00...... door was open but they don't open until 5:00.  It was a birthday plan for dinner with my college daughter....ended up with leftovers at home.  Businesses should make sure info is correct"}
{"text":"Have been to many Thai restaurants throughout the USA and in Thailand.  This place definitely ranks in the top 10%.  Has the standard items, plus some unusual items like pumpkin curry.  Small interior dining room, but elegantly done.  Lively atmosphere.  No liquor license and BYOB, but be prepared to pay a corkage fee (wine and beer).  Management should look into getting a liquor license.  Papaya salad is a must try here as it is very authentic.  Though we didn't sit in backyard patio, definitely would want to sit there next time."}
{"text":"The BEST Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh! I love that it's BYOB and they have a beautiful patio in the summer. It CAN get a little noisy (especially if someone has children with them) and the wait staff can be a little spotty, but the food is excellent and the decor is very tasteful."}
{"text":"First time trying Thai food and couldn't have been more pleased with the overall experience at Nicky's. We got to seat in the beautiful outdoor patio, what an oasis. Had the most delicious crab rangoon I've ever tasted as appetizer, along with the crispy egg rolls. For entree, I ordered the Spicy Basil Fried Shrimp bc read many positive reviews on Yelp. It was amazing!! Enough to take for next day's lunch. All of the servers were very kind. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"As you first enter you are welcomed to what appears to be someone's former house. It had a quirky feel to it which adds to the awesome food. 

Food was excellent. Service was great. We were seated immediately and had our drink orders taken promptly. This is a proper thai restaurant so if you are looking for a commercial vibe this isn't your place. They do their spicy food by numerical value. 1 the least spicy 10 the spiciest. I went with a 5 and was pleased with it but could have easily have gone hotter. 
The best part besides the food is the reasonably priced food. My wife and I didn't pay over 20 dollars for our meal."}
{"text":"The food was average and it didn't wow me. I've definitely had better Thai food in Pittsburgh, and it's a pretty chaotic restaurant (buncha tables close to one another, super crowded & noisy)"}
{"text":"My wife and I love to enjoy a meal here any chance we get.  The atmosphere is great, especially if you eat outside in the courtyard.  In the winter months the inside can be a tad noisy, but that is due to the close quarters.  The fresh spring rolls are one of the best things on the menu.  I usually chose my go-to option of Pad Thai, which is always great, and my wife rocks the Coconut Curry, Veg option.  

The BYOB option is great if you care to enjoy dinner with Beer or wine, which we have done, the corking fee is very reasonable.  I believe it is $5.00 for the table and not per bottle. I recommend bringing your own alcohol.  

Great place and Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had Pad Thai and pork Wild Curry... the best in town so far. This place makes me feel like I'm eating in Bangkok. Especially Wild curry, you don't see this menu often in U.S."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after I'd tried Nicki's in downtown. This place has the best thai food in pitts.. we had mango curry, crab rangoon, crying tiger wrap? everything was so good and big portion for dinner. They has variety of curry and also has \"Koa Soy\" which is northern thai traditional dish. Will be back many more times for sure."}
{"text":"This place is bomb! If you want some authentic Thai food this is the place to go.. You'll be leaving this place satisfied"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal! 
We had dinner here and the reviews excited me. We started with pork dumplins that were unlike any I've had before. Packed full with pork and water chestnuts and steamed. These were delicious.
For the main course I got pumpkin curry with chicken and it was great. My wife got a grilled duck curry. She said the duck didnt appear to be grilled, but she loved it. 
The interior here is beautiful and our waitress was attentive and kind. 
Great place! I shall return."}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Thai food. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic, always a good go to when craving Thai. I do however wish that the services was a little slower, I know that's probably a strange statement. Sometimes feels a little rushed, but hey it's my FAVORITE Thai in Pittsburgh so I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal at this place. I love the noodle curry and the beef noodle soup. I love that it's BYOB. I get take out there a lot and I also dine in.  My favorite thai place in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"When it comes to Thai food in Pittsburgh my go-to is Noodlehead and unfortunately, my last experience at Nicky's Thai confirmed that. I always go for the Pad See Ew with vegetables, but the last time I had Nicky's the food really had zero flavor. I don't see consistency with their cooking. I ordered a spice level 9/10 last time and it had zero spice; the workers warn you anything above 5 is extremely spicy. Also in recent times my noodles have not been fresh, tasting hard and stale. And the flavor was basically all oil and zero spice/flavor. Sad to review this because the staff is truly wonderful, as is the outside garden for dining. If you do go definitely go in the warmer months to take advantage of the beautiful ambience of the back yard."}
{"text":"Cool restaurant with good food.  Bring your own wine and sit out on the terrace when its warm."}
{"text":"The pad see ewe was way too sweet. it tasted like sweet noodles, not a savory hint in sight. My co-worker got the spicy noodles. it tasted good but you could not really taste the basil, which is the key ingredient in this thai dish. 

The location and prices were good. I'd give it 1 star for authenticity though...."}
{"text":"Was excellent at one time but like so many great restaurants, I think they've over extended themselves.

Food was fair.  What was supposed to be mild was way too spicy.  Wait was ridiculous.  Service was very good.

Spring Rolls we're still amazing!  Great!! Samosas were ok.  The rest of the meal mediocre to not great.

We went often as a family but everyone left unenthusiastic, barely eating our meals.

Sadly, the Nicky Thai food we ate at in downtime Pittsburgh is not the same quality as it once was in Oakmont/Verona."}
{"text":"Very nice decoration and food was good too. Try the coconut sake, it's very silky"}
{"text":"Finally tried Nicky's out last night.... And the verdict is: delicious! I had the green curry with chicken, and it was creamy, fresh and flavorful. Also, it was served in this really unique brass urn- looking thing... which was cool and impressed me.  I'm a wimp and can't do super spicy, and they accommodated that easily. My date had the spicy basil fried rice, which was good, yet too hot for this girl. He loved it though. The atmosphere was comfortable, employees nice, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We found this place via yelp.  The restaurant decoration is nicely done.  We were first excited.  However the hostess lacked facial expressions, not even a smile to greet us.  My kid has peanut allgery,  and we told our server as soon as we set down.  However they still put peanuts on our salad.  She bit into a mango already before we realized that.  They gave us another salad but didn't seem all concerned or apologetic.   She was okay at the end, but the dining experience just went south.  The food was okay but wouldn't recommend based on the service experience.  Plus they automatically charge 18% tips.  No wonder the service is less standard."}
{"text":"Great food! Always busy at lunch. One complaint is that you feel rushed and you're basically sitting on top of people (once seated) or standing huddled like you're on the T on a steelers game to get a table. Slower hours great service and fantastic food!"}
{"text":"LOVE Nicky's Thai Kitchen! I usually stick to Pad Thai or Pad See Ew and they are always great! I love the soup that you get with it, I wish it was available for purchase on its own. The crab Rangoon's are my favorite out of anywhere I've had!  The only downfall I've found is how squished together the tables are but it's still worth it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat for lunch in the entire city. I go here at least once a week and most recently went here three times in one week. It is located on a non-busy side of town on Penn Avenue right past Pizza Parma. Inside there are gorgeous pictures and a dimmed lights atmosphere perfect for a date or a lunch gathering. I go here with friends and even by myself. Most of the lunch meals are under $9.00 and they include your choice of a house salad that has a unique pineapple flavored dressing or chicken & rice soup which is always extrememly hot and tasty. The server staff is excellent and very quick in bringing out your food. As soon as my order is taken my salad or soup is immediately brought out and once I finish that here comes my entree. 

Onto the entree selections. I typically try and get something new here, but my very favorite is the Beef Phad Phet with a 9 spice level. I typically get between a 7 and a 9 depending on the day, but the spice levels go up to a 20 so if you like spicy flavors this place is for you. This dish includes beef, garlic, bell peppers, green beans, carrots, onions, thai basil and an incredible spicy chili sauce with rice on the side. i have also gotten the Spicy green beans, Spicy peanut, Jalepeno, and the Red Curry which are all amazing. My friend really likes the Green curry. I might try that once next time. You have the option of choosing chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, vegetable, duck or tofu. I like the beef the best and like the chicken with my curry.

I am always full when I leave this place and you cannot beat the prices or the quality of the food anywhere. I would recommend to make dinner reservations or if you go for lunch to go either at 11:00 or 1:30. I like to go at 1:30 because it is not crowded when I arrive and even less crowded by the time I finish up and leave the restaurant. 

Bottom Line: Seriously give this place a try. Even if you don't like spicy food it is all excellent."}
{"text":"Best Thai in the city - as far as my opinion is concerned. If you go to the location in North Side there's great outdoor seating. Spring Rolls are fresh and refreshing for that matter. Pad Thai is always a hit and their curry (any curry) is right on."}
{"text":"One hundred percent certain that this is the best Thai in the city. I've had Thai in a few different areas around town and this still holds the number one position. Curry is great, pad Thai is amazing, Thai tea is delicious and cheap. Worth it."}
{"text":"Extremely hot inside, the hostess not welcoming..      The older lady who goes around pouring water is terribly rude (to the point of spilling the water in my lap) and should not be, as this is a restaurant and she works in it.  It stinks like a sewer in there...really stinks like a literal sewer.   The tables are too tiny to be comfortable. We walked out.  Next time, try saying Hi or Welcome.  My recommendation is to not give them your money based on terrible uncaring, and unappreciative service.  Never again."}
{"text":"Great food, nice staff, decorative dining room. The staff was helpful in navigating the menu and the kitchen did a good job of getting each party member's level of spiciness right. The appetizer sampler was great, and the entrees were delicious. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes Thai or wants to try it."}
{"text":"I've been on a quest to try all the thai places in the city for awhile. There are still a few left, but I feel confident calling this one the best. Authentic thai food with high heat levels (love). Usually I'm more adventurous with my meal options but here I almost always get the pad thai. Simple things done right can't be beat. All that said I have only ever done takeout, and hope to amend that soon."}
{"text":"Great Thai food in downtown Pittsburgh.
Staff are pretty friendly for sitting patrons. They try to be gracious to takeout folks if they are not too busy.
The Panang Curry is lovely. Carefully order the heat level. I ordered 'Thai-Hot' and I was humbled as it made me cry / but it still tasted good.
The crabbish appetizer looks good but its boring & not very good (see photo).
Mr Tee at the Mgr is great to talk to.
Take your time & relax at a cool throwback decor with good food & conversation."}
{"text":"Went with a large group to Nicky's on Sunday. As always the food was great. We sat outside in the garden and really enjoyed the ambiance. They renovated the garden since the last time I was there about a year ago and freed up a lot of space. It was a little dark in our corner, but you should try and sit in the garden.

While everyone enjoyed the food, the spice levels seemed pretty arbitrary. Some 6's were spicy and others not at all. We also ordered an order of spring rolls that never arrived. 

The Tom Yum soup was excellent. Highly recommended if you're headed to Nicky's."}
{"text":"I've read the reviews on here and heard many praises for Nicky's so I thought I'd stop in for lunch today and see what all the hoopla was about. I got there at about 11:45 on a Friday morning and I'm glad that I did.  The place started to fill quickly. 

I was seated promptly and given a minute to look over the menu. Decisions, decisions... there were so many items that I wanted to try but settled on the spicy green beans with chicken. The waiter took my order and ask me, on a scale of 1 to 10, how spicy I would like it. I do like spicy foods so I went with an 8. 

My house salad came quickly: lettuce, tomato, carrots, a slice of mango, a cube of pineapple, sprinkled with crumbled peanuts and lightly coated in a sweet dressing. Delicious!

I thought it took a little longer than it should for my entrée to come and used the time to take in the décor. Lots going on here with all of the art. It was almost museum like.  When my dish finally did arrive, I just sat there and admired it for a few moments. Visually it was a work of art. The greens of green beans against the reds of the pepper with the sprinkle of red flakes on the chicken all on top of the red sauce was simply a thing of beauty. Then on the other side of the plate laid a perfectly shaped round mound of rice with a single ragoon elegantly placed on top. In front of the rice was a swirl of carrot strips and a green leafy garnish just for appearance. The chef gets an A++ for presentation!

When I finally did dive into the meal it was simply delightful. I never had green beans taste this good! The amount of spiciness was perfect. The texture of the beans and peppers was crisp and the chicken was cooked to perfection. I now know what all the hoopla surrounding Nicky's Thai is all about. I will definitely come back again and again."}
{"text":"Nicky's downtown location is amazing, great atmosphere and food; so I thought this location would be the same. It was not the same food standard. The place is absolutely beautiful I love the ambiance. The service was okay kind of slow, but it was packed and busy on a Saturday night. The menu is plentiful and diverse, full of delicious choices. I enjoyed the spring rolls. They have a unique unexpected Indian spice to them, similar to Samosas. My green curry with shrimp was not up to par. The shrimp was completely overcooked tough and rubbery. It also was NOT fully deveined?! The curry was flavorful but seemed to be low on vegetables. My friend and I were also only given one side of rice between us even though we both ordered curries and should have each had our own. I was so excited for this new location to open, but was sadly disappointed with my visit. I might give the place another try in a few months. More likely to return to the downtown location.

*update
I did return & had a much better experience. I stuck to chicken though!"}
{"text":"This is the BEST THAI I've had in a really long time! 

When we got there, we had to wait about 15 minutes even though we had a reservation. It was well worth the wait though! The dining area is really small but the restaurant is authentic and the atmosphere is relaxing. 

Ordered the Thai Toast for an appetizer - they weren't crunchy or soft. Perfect consistency and they came with a wonderful cucumber sauce which made the dish complete. 

For my entree, I ordered the Shrimp Red Curry. This was my favorite dish of the night! We got a spice level of 5 and it was perfect. YOU MUST GET THIS DISH! My boyfriend got the panang curry, which he also loved.

The service was excellent. Can't wait to go back to Pittsburgh so I can go back to Nicky's Thai kitchen!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and friendly staff. The crab rangoon is one of the better ones I have had out in recent memory. The food was fresh and flavorful. Thankful to have a closer location in the North Hills now!

The only thing I was disappointed in was the house salad/lunch salad. That flavor was bland and the lettuce was very wet. 

Allergy notes:
While not noted in any description the salad came with crushed peanuts on it. // Always mention allergies to your server. // I am not allergic, but we tend to avoid due to family member allergy. (Although if you have peanut, tree nut, or sesame allergies you are probably not eating asian food out.)"}
{"text":"My family has been eating at Nicky's Thai Kitchen long before the rest of Pittsburgh discovered it and you needed a reservation to get in here on the weekends. They recently opened another downtown location but the Western Avenue Nicky's will always hold a special place in my heart, especially in warm weather when the Zen Garden around back is open for dining with it's beautiful foliage, Buddhas, and trickling water fountains. You forget you're on the Northside!

Nicky's seafood dishes have won my heart over the years so much that I pretty much order whatever seafood dish is on their specials list. In the summer it's often Seafood Phad Cha and I'm always delighted to see that because its my favorite one ever - the sauce is amazing! Their sauces are always so flavorful with lots of fresh veggies & delicious fresh seafood like shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, tilapia and often some crazy corkscrew looking piece of seafood that I can't identify but thoroughly enjoy! Recently the special was Chili Mango Seafood which had a slightly sweeter sauce with the addition of the fresh mango. You can order your preference of heat from 1-10, and I always go 6 - I enjoy a good kick!

Since 2 of our family members are vegetarian, we've probably ordered every vegetarian appetizer they offer over the years and they are all delightful. There is often a sampler vegetarian option on the specials menu. You also can't go wrong with the veggie spring rolls or samosas.

Nicky's on Western Ave. is also BYOB & typically there's no corkage fee.  Love, love, love Nicky's!"}
{"text":"Nicky's is gorgeous inside, with ornate, gold and colorful Thai decorations. I got the fried egg rolls, spicy basil fried rice with tofu and a Thai iced tea and it was all ridiculously good! The egg rolls looked to be spiced with turmeric inside and were yellow. Crispy to perfection and came with a pineapple dipping sauce which I thought was unique from other Thai places dipping sauce. The spicy basil fried rice was very good as well. I asked for it at a medium spice level and I am Indian and can handle crazy spicy and this was perfectly nice and spicy. It is a true Thai spice level I would say so if you are worried about spice levels, maybe start with mild. Love this place and will be back here again soon! Highly recommend going!"}
{"text":"Can't get enough of the green curry with tofu! Absolutely delicious. Wonderful service and the outside seating is a patio in the back that is really beautiful. A new favorite."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for some after-night-out food.

Heard good things about this place, and it just about met my expectations... didn't exceed them. My go to disk is the Pad See Ew, and the presentation was wonderful, but the taste was average. Also, they used the wrong kind of broccoli! You need to use the Chinese/Asian broccoli for Pad See Ew, or the whole composure of the dish is messed up!

Regardless, the food did the trick and I was full and happy afterwards. Good food, but nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"The food was too salty for my liking. I got pumpkin curry with shrimp and was expecting something slightly sweet with coconut milk. However, the food was too salty. It was a strange flavor and will never get this item. Actually all of the dishes my party ordered were salty. For the price, it was not worth it. Won't come back again."}
{"text":"This place was right down the street from where we were staying so we decided to give it a try. It was so good! The spring rolls were amazing! My husband got the Won Ton soup, which I'm normally not a huge fan of, but it was also really good. My Pad Thai was also really good. I wasn't used to their heat scale rating though, so I could have used a little more heat in my dish, but other than that, a great place!"}
{"text":"Love Nicky's North Side location! 

Came during lunch on a Saturday with a pretty big group, and they seated us immediately outside. Having been to the downtown location as well, North Side definitely has more space and wasn't too crowded! The outside area is probably one of my favorite outside restaurant venues, similar to Pusadee's Garden in Lawrenceville. They preserve a lot of traditional Thai pieces outside amongst the greenery and fountain decoration! 

In terms of food, I had pad see yew with chicken and was pleasantly surprised that the chicken wasn't as dry as other places I've had this dish. Since we came for lunch, all orders came with soup or salad as well! A lot of my friends enjoyed their curries here, although they serve in more elaborate dishes at the downtown location during dinner. And their Thai Tea is quite good, although I prefer thicker and creamier than their recipe. They serve Green Thai Tea which is special though! 

Service was so kind, I accidentally knocked over my water, and they helped me clean up and brought a new one out immediately. Most of all, we were able to split the check with 7 people (THANK YOU) and overall loved the space and food!"}
{"text":"Second location for this place. This one in the Cultural District and a little bigger. BYOB until PLCB approval. Food great. Especially the curries, of which there are tons, and the pictured Phra Luck. Black stickie rice dessert...mmm.  So, so good. If you are a fan of Thai, get there now!  If not, you will be after a trip!"}
{"text":"I feel a bit let down by my curry I ate last night... and curry is such a warm dish. You want it to hug your mouth with flavor on a cold day... not remind you of the flavors your taste buds can't find. Like kissing an old boyfriend you thought your feelings would return and then.... Nothing but little shreds of disappointment. 

So why three stars? I've eaten at Nicky's other times and the service is excellent also a second dish I'm reviewing here fared a bit better than my lacking Massaman. 

Room for improvement: I couldn't taste the hints of tamarind, cinnamon, garlic or nutmeg or mace. Which should be key stars of the paste. My meal was prepped and brought to me fast but also means it probably was in part pre made. The results were more of a generic salt peanut tasting sauce. More of something I've had on satay. 

They used dry red pepper in the sauce which is fine for the paste but it lowers the hot spice flavor. Using oil or fresh red pepper will fix that fast. In addition to the dried pepper I ordered it at a 7 spice level but personally it felt like a 4 or 5 tops. I do not eat spicy food often so my tolerance is not high. 

The better dish -- my boyfriend's pumpkin tofu curry was a better bet and really I think Nicky's pleases better with its non traditional dishes. The pumpkin was soft and sauce a nice middle between sweet and spicy. Sadly the spice level was missing like a thief in the night..... No sweat beads made an appearance. The tofu was chewy but not underdone which is a tofu fear of mine ( texture fears). 

Overall it's gorgeous in here and you get about 4 inches more elbow room than the Western st location. You also can eat without a reservation at 5 if you can be done eating by 630. The prices are decent for portion size... Service is prompt polite and they will offer more rice if you need it. I think I'll try some other dishes and hope for a better outcome next time."}
{"text":"Nicky's Northside is good, but I have had better (more comfortable) Thai in PGH.  The wife, daughter, and I visited to celebrate my wife getting an A on test.  We sat on top of another couple and even eating in Japan could not prepare me for the closeness.  
The wait staff was great - attentive and polite.  
I got the crab rangoons and my wife got Tom Yum Gai soup.  The rangoons were pretty good - good crisp, nice filling, the sauce was stolen from a Chinese buffet though then stripped of seasoning.  My wife's soup was thin....huge chunks of what have you floated in the broth.
Luckily the main courses were good.  I had the street noodles and my wife had green curry.  Both were top notch.  Too bad the seating is Jenga'ish and the appetizers are totally meh."}
{"text":"Great food and quick service. We had chicken pad Thai and red curry with shrimp. Very tasty"}
{"text":"Must be on of my all time favorite Thai restaurants.  Food is fantastic.  I eat here regularly."}
{"text":"Best carry out Thai I've ever had.  Huge portions and high quality ingredients.  Worth the extra few dollars."}
{"text":"Came back after 2 years and barring one, nothing else has changed. They let go of fried fish in Wild Curry (which I drove for 5 hours for) which hurt me, physically. The wild curry itself remains my personal favorite. Yummm ...

Everything else is still amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food! Had one of the curry items for lunch, which came with either soup or salad. The only disappointment was the salad was made up of iceberg lettuce. Do people in Thailand really eat iceberg lettuce I wonder?"}
{"text":"Super service, very good food, and five stars due to the delightful, verdant back patio. BYOB is just a bonus - reasonable five dollar corkage fee. Pad Thai is excellent, and enough to feed a small family."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars. 

We made reservations but were a bit late because of traffic and luckily they were super nice about it and weren't busy so we were able to be seated. 

I got the Thai tea ($2.50) and it was SUPER good. I thought it was very well done I drank mines super fast! 

We ordered the Panang and pad see eaw. We got them 5/5 spicy. I didn't think it was actually 5/5 spiciness. The Panang was solid and super yummy, but the pad see eaw was super disappointing. To make it spicier, they literally drenched it in red chili flakes. It gave it a super weird texture that wasn't even spicy, so I didn't really enjoy it. I feel like the underlying flavor is super good, but when it is drenched in red chili flakes, it tasted really odd. The Panang comes with rice, and it filled like half of the bowl it came in. There wasn't a good Panang to rice ratio so we ordered more rice and it was $3!!! I thought that was kind of crazy, it was more expensive than the drink! Also, the extra rice is a lot of rice, so I wish that the rice that came with the Panang actually filled the bowl so you didn't have to order $3 rice."}
{"text":"I usually go to Le Thai Cafe for Thai food but I live only a few blocks from this place so decided to try it last night & I was so disappointed :( 

I'm originally from NYC, & lived in Philly for a few year so I have had my fair share of Thai food. I guess that has made me a Thai food snob because I got red curry with chicken from Nicky's and it was just very unimpressive and nothing like I'm used to.  It tasted like canned tomatoes with an overwhelming flavor of string beans  (almost as if they used canned string beans and dumped the string bean juice in with everything **yuck**). Also, there was so much red pepper flakes in it that I was actually crunching down on them with every bite! Couldn't taste (or see) any coconut milk in it or any red curry flavor for that matter! It was just a clear liquidity red sauce with red pepper flakes. I like the real deal Thai flavors so this made me sad. I probably won't be back which sucks bc i'm so close by...but  I like authentic Thai food so I'll be driving back out to Glenshaw for the real deal."}
{"text":"Went twice for dinner.  Two dishes blew me away...The Fish Basil, and the Pad Thai.  I've been to 20-30 Thai restaurants, and the the Pad Thai was perhaps the best I've tasted.  Other dishes were ok, but didn't stand out.  These included: Beef Noodle Soup, Massaman Curry, Red Curry, Pa Ram Chicken, and the Somosa, and Steamed Dumpling appetizers.

The place was full by 7:30 Saturday night, so you should probably make a reservation."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to come here for some time and it certainly delivered. 

The decor was beautiful, zen, interesting. 

The food was amazing! The general consensus from myself and those around me: 4-10 spice level. 5 is hot, I get 7 and my friends always are shocked, my native Indian friend gets 10.

I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Lawrenceville's Istanbul was closed for the evening once again (gone for good?), and I desired supper since milady Kay was away with a girl buddy for the evening, so to this newest incarnation of Nicky's I arrived with a raging appetite after work this past icy, windy Friday. 

Golden elephant gods and nearly naked female deities loomed over me in the shaded, candlelit room, watching me curiously but benevolently. 

Nicky's fare is deceptively infernal. I ordered my entree at a humble \"medium\" when asked and was left with a tongue as numb as the mind of an avid \"Jerseyliscious\" viewer. 

Beginning the proceedings was a serving of their Salmon Curry Cakes, which I might have liked even more had they been spongier and less springy. Saving this close-to-mediocre dish was the syrupy cucumber sauce that itself was piquant enough to wake a sleeping palate. 

The main event consisted of Pad Cha Squid, a dish that brought me to my knees with an essence that burned like scorpion venom. 

My nose ran with goo, my eyes filled with saline, my cheeks became ruddy, and my mouth sizzled, rendering me almost mute as I struggled to eat the al dente calamari, the Thai eggplant (!), the white rice, the curry sauce that deluged the entire dish, proteins, vegetables and all. 

I heard the spice fiends of the Yelposphere cackling then as I hear them now in my head. I curse thee sadists!

Unsettling me further was that I almost requested a spice level of 10 instead of a mere 5. It's too horrible to comprehend what might have been. 

Barely finishing the dish, I quickly paid my tab and hurried across Penn Avenue to Ben and Jerry's for that which exorcises demonic, maniacal, and racy foods: Ice Cream. 

P.S. The service was excellent, friendly, and seemed heartily amused to watch me attempt to wrestle Ravana in a bowl. My soul is safe...for now."}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant for dinner while in the city for a few days.
We both liked the embiance. Started with a spring roll, samosa, egg roll platter. They where crispy and light. The sauces where flavorful.
I had the phad thai w seafood. The serving was good size. The amount of seafood was balanced well with  the rest of the ingredients. Very tasty.
My girlfriend had the seafood noodle soup. Be prepared for a large bowl. It could easily serve two or even three people. It was flavorful. Both meals  where eye pleasing in presentation. 
The server's where attentive. Checking back but not too often. My GF ordered her soup at a 7 and then requested additional spice. This was delivered promptly.
We have a new go to place while downtown."}
{"text":"We were just there for lunch.  There were 3 adults and one 9month old infant.  The food was so good, we all ordered takeout for dinner.  We had several of the appetizers for lunch along with soup.  The staff were very friendly and very good with the baby.  I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Walk in to a small hall with a staircase.  
Meet the staff at the door by the kitchen.
Get seated in a small crowded dining room.
With reservations, the hostess said we have someone coming in in 2 hours so we need you to be done with your meal.
That is OK with us as long as the kitchen doesn't take to long, we reply.  
BYOB.  Maybe it was because we had a few bottles of wine, they thought we might linger.
We were eager to order...love Thai food.  We were not disappointed.
The veggie dumping was delicious.  Soft with some nice spiciness, yet mild.
I order the Gaprow Lad Kao with pork.  Stir fried with bell pepper, garlic, basil leaves, spicy brown sauce, topped with fried egg, served over rice.
Nice and spicy, but not to much, some sweetness too. 
Well we finished with no room for desert and easily made or deadline!"}
{"text":"Amazing thai place in town!
Loved the food and the service.

Food is great
Staffs are super friendly
Service is good
Prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"Came here on the suggestion of a friend and was not disappointed. Had a great meal. The spring rolls were a bit unique (comes as sushi rolls) and packed a lot of flavor inside. We also ordered crispy tofu with peanut sauce which was quite delicious too. One should definitely try the green curry. That was really good with lot of different flavors to pack your mouth ( little sweeter for my taste but that's the coconut in it). We also had the rice noodles with sauteed tofu and basil sauce. I would absolutely come back to this place next time I'm in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Such a find...great food, perfect service, and a dozen different \"I'd like to try that next time\" things coming out of the kitchen.\" Would definitely repeat. 

The appetizer platter for 4 is a great value."}
{"text":"Great spot i found on the fly. Great location, cool decor not to mention Amazing pad thai and pot stickers!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that I haven't been in the mood for Thai food much in recent months, but decided to try Nicky's Thai Kitchen since it's been on my list of restaurants to try for a long time. That was a great move on my part because this place is so good. I thought there would be a wait, as I arrived at 7:30pm on a Friday evening, but to my pleasant surprise I was seated right away.

The interior of the restaurant is beautiful. (Part of me thinks the atmosphere inside made the food taste better.) I really felt like I was transported to another world. The restaurant was only about half full (you would think that it would be way more crowded), so there was the perfect amount of chatter around you to make it feel like a restaurant, but not an overwhelming noise that made it hard to talk or hear the person across from you.

I ordered the green Thai iced tea (new to me) and the massaman curry. It took them a while to get me my green Thai iced tea and it seemed like they had forgotten about it, but they were nice and did not charge me for it. The drink was pretty good and its green color made it look pretty cool too. My massaman curry was very, very good. It was so rich in flavor. I thought it wouldn't be enough, but surprisingly I was very full after just finishing half of it. My friend and I also shared the samosas for an appetizer. They were made with sweet potato. I usually don't like sweet potato, but these didn't taste that bad at all. They were light and crisp (but also very hot, so wait a bit before you eat).

Nicky's Thai Kitchen is a great restaurant and probably the best Thai restaurant I've tried in Pittsburgh. Yum! I will most likely be back and bring all my friends who are Thai food fans with me.

{"text":"Many great choices, including vegetarian options. Flavorful but not nuclear-spiced food. Charming interior and reasonably priced. Win. Win. Win."}
{"text":"I got the pad thai here, because I'm *that person* that always gets pad thai when I go to Thai restaurants. And I got it at a level 0 on the spicy-scale. Man, I wish I would have got a level 2 or 3. At level 0, their pad thai is REALLY sweet. But otherwise, their service is EXCELLENT. My water glass was always full and the staff was ridiculously friendly and warm."}
{"text":"We were traveling through Pittsburg and found this place on Yelp. I loved the people and environment. Our server was very friendly and helpful. She made some recommendation and we loves it. We order Tom yun, red chili shrimp and fried rice basil and regular. We order extra hot papaya salad. That was a mistake.. It was too hot but still good. Good portion was good size we end up taking our left over food."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many Thai restaurants and this one is at the top of the list. I go out of my way when in Pittsburgh to eat at Nicky's. The staff is very friendly and the food is amazing. Definitely a must if you're in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food in Pittsburgh can be found at Nicky's Thai Kitchen. Upon entering, you're transported to another world - the interior is lavishly decorated with golden statues and other cultural decorations. During several visits, service has always been exceptional and prompt, and the food is always absolutely delicious. Some notable dishes that I've had are the Sen Mee Pad See Ew, Thai Basil Chicken (note that the entrees don't come with a side order of rice), Drunken Noodles, and the Crab Fried Rice. Their appetizers are exceptional as well. This one time they had Thai style chicken wings that I still dream about to this very day. 

This is a must visit restaurant in the heart of Downtown, but be sure to make reservations if you go on a weekend, especially for dinner."}
{"text":"This was my third time dining at Nicky's downtown location, and the second time for New Year's Eve. Nicky's Thai food is always delicious. The 5 mini egg rolls with sweet dipping sauce were hot & crispy. The Tom Kha coconut soup is fantastic & was full of fresh veggies & tofu (choice to add chicken, shrimp, etc). My husband had the whole crispy sea bass and I had green curry with chicken. Both entrees were very good & served with white rice to share. Even though they have a bar, you can still BYOB with a corkage fee. Service was quick & friendly. It's a small place, so when it's crowded, which is all the time during prime dining hours, be prepared to have other guests seated very close to you. You can choose 1-10 spice level. I like some spice, but even a 4 could be too spicy for some. We will definitely return & hope to try the North Hills location soon."}
{"text":"I stopped here before the theater and loved it.  I had the scallop soup and the seafood noodle dish both from the Chef's menu.  The décor was beautiful, the whole place smelled of jasmine, and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Thai tourism should blame this place for not wanting to make subsequent trips to Thailand. Having visited Thailand, the food out here gets as good as the real stuff. I could imagine myself back on the Koh Samui island. Being a vegetarian, this place has amazing options. Please do yourself a favor and get the Tom Yum soup pot. The flavors will turn you on and get you crazy! Also Singha beer is the thing! Go for it!"}
{"text":"I had the spicy fish with green beans and Thai iced tea. The fish was really good! A good amount of spicy and not too oily, salty, or sweet. The veggies seemed pretty fresh, and presentation was nice. A server came out quite often to make sure our water was filled, which was convenient since the food was spicy. Thai iced tea was also good."}
{"text":"Went for the first time recently and fell in love. It's affordable and delicious!! Always get the pad Thai and spicy basil mussels. The pineapple fried rice is another favorite. BYOB. (Which I love) and the patio is amazing and you feel like you're on vacation. New favorite place!"}
{"text":"We've been looking for good Thai food and finally found some at Nicky's Thai kitchen!  The service is quick and attentive. The restaurant is spacious inside and out (although can be noisy outside w/ road noise & the air compressor). The food is delicious and presentation was a nice surprise!  We ordered the vegetable samosas for an appetizer; it was a bit greasy, but nice sweet flavor.  Then Chicken pad see ew and yellow curry w/ chicken for main dishes; both very tasty w/ good quality chicken."}
{"text":"Wish I lived in Pittsburgh! I went with my daughter (5) and husband who is Chinese. We are always looking for authentic Asian cuisine. We came to Nicky's by way of a recommendation from a friend's brother who lives locally. I also found it interesting that it was the top recommendation from the man at our hotel as well. We waited about 15 mins around 1:45 pm and boy, was it worth it! We ate chicken pad Thai, beef noodle soup and Thai fried rice. We went light on the heat (6) since our little girl was with us, but we could have stepped up a level I think. The food was amazing and my husband declared it the best pad Thai he's had. We would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nicky's Thai Kitchen is the perfect place to go if you want a great sit down Thai restaurant. It's classy and reasonably priced and all of the food is amazing. I've been several times and my go to is the classic Pad Thai (I usually get a spice level 2), but I have also tried, the Vegetable 4 U appetizer, Sen Mee Pad See Ew, the Cashew Entree, and the Red Curry with Tofu. Every dish has earned this 5 star rating. You should definitely give it a try. If you want to go on a Friday or Saturday night I would recommend making a reservation as they do get busy, but from my experience other nights of the week you will usually be okay without one."}
{"text":"The food came out fast and every bit of it was excellent. We started with a Thai chicken and rice soup that was incredible. We shared an appetizer platter that featured curried crab rangoon, shrimp toast, chicken satay, and pork dumplings served with four dipping sauces. We also shared an order of shrimp phad thai. The ingredients were very fresh, hot and cooked to perfection. 

My only complaints are that the food came out almost too fast, with our soup, appetizers and main course back to back. Also, the prices were a bit high for lunch (but would have been fine for dinner). Overall, I would absolutely go back for lunch or dinner. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"They have a really nice outdoor patio!  The service was good, but unfortunately I didn't like my meal.  I had Teriyaki Chicken.  The chicken was tough and the whole meal didn't have much flavor"}
{"text":"Came with a large group and had quick service, but more importantly really flavorful food. Started off with Thai iced tea that was a nice refreshing drink. For dinner, I ordered the spicy thai basil fried rice with tofu spice level of 5. The tofu was nice and crispy and the fried rice had nice hints of garlic. Had the mango sticky rice for dessert, which did not disappoint as well. Definitely looking forward to coming back to trying the curries and noodles!"}
{"text":"My favorite for Thai! Friendly staff, quick service, awesomely delicious food!! The pineapple curry is by far my favorite, but haven't had one bad meal here. We always leave stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"I'm sure this place doesn't need another glowing rating, but I can't help myself! I've eaten here dozens of times over the last several years and my recent trip was just as expected - wonderful. The food is the best Thai in the city as far as I'm concerned. I ordered the green curry chicken pot, but also ordered won ton soup for my son to go. It's amazing and full of garlic. He would have disowned me if I didn't bring him some. The service is also always wonderful. I never feel rushed and the time between courses is just right."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Great ambiance in their outdoor seating area; very intimate and quiet. Their fresh spring rolls are my favorite, but everything is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here for the first time recently and I thought it was just ok. I ordered the Siracha noodles with chicken, crab rangoons, and spring rolls. The spring rolls were 5 stars-crispy, tender, and delicious. The crab rangoons and noodles, however, were disappointing. I've had better crab rangoons from the Cheesecake Factory. The noodles were over-cooked in my opinion and the chicken dry. I've heard so many great things that I'll go back and order something different. To be continued...
On another note, the service was excellent."}
{"text":"This restaurant has good food with just the right level of spices and flavors, but seating arrangement and loud atmosphere makes it almost impossible to Interact with others when at this place."}
{"text":"Mmmmm. This place gets an extra star just because they were able to accommodate my extra cilantro request and actually delivered! 

My friend and I went on NYE, thankfully we had made a reservation because I didn't know how tiny this place is! 

We ordered & split:
Vegetable 4 U app: Two fresh spring rolls, three crispy egg rolls and three samosas with dipping sauces.
Spicy noodle: Wide rice noodles stir-fried egg with tofu and Napa cabbage in a spicy basil sauce
Tofu tamarind: Deep fried tofu, over steam mix vegetable Topped with a sweet Tamarind sauce.
Extra cilantro on both the entrees! Yaaaas. Spice level 1 which actually varied between the two dishes. 

Our server was pleasant and helpful and overall the night was a success. I definitely can't wait to go back and try more of  the menu."}
{"text":"If you have Indian taste buds, who enjoy a mouth full of flavors and you are looking for something not Indian, this is the right place.
I ordered Spicy noodles with chicken (hot). The portion was a good size. So was the portions for all the dishes I have seen across the tables. Most of them had take away boxes in hand while leaving.

I went on pirates game day and still the place was packed, thanks for the early reservations I did for the garden table.
Tip: If you go with friends, or family, or on a date, get the outside table. Make reservations so you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in Pittsburgh. The mango salad has a wonderful spicy taste. Every meal I have had has been wonderful. Side note, at this place the hottest ranges from 4-10 not 1-10 so just be cautious. A 5 is usually as hot as I can go!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times. The decorations are gold and extravagant. The tables are pretty close together, and it does get packed- especially at lunch. That being said- the crab rangoon is out of this world!!! So delicious. It comes with many of the lunches as well as a soup or salad. 

I'm pretty new to Thai but I do love the pineapple fried rice and the basil fried rice with vegetables. The spice scale was 1-10 and now it's 1-5, so that's a little confusing but I like some spice so I'll order on the higher end. Prices are much more reasonable at lunch as opposed to dinner, but the portions are big. They also do takeout, so that's a good option if you're in a hurry. I'd say it's a great option to take someone for a meal when you're downtown."}
{"text":"Great Tai food. We picked it up and ate in our hotel and we loved it. It was quite crowded, likely because it seems to be a favorite of lots of people. Definitely would go back when in the area, would love to sit down and eat there."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in the area.  I've gotten a lot of different entrees here over the months, and I would recommend:

- wild curry (fantastic)
- spicy eggplant
- pad thai
- fish with basil
- most of the salads

The curries tend to be OK, but not stand-out fantastic.  People in my party have occasionally gotten the green curry (but, thankfully, have never had the upsetting salmon-colored dish alluded to by Dr. K).  It didn't strike me as particularly memorable in either direction."}
{"text":"I would give it a 31/2 probably. With the plethora of Thai places in pittsburgh, I was expecting a little more than average when I went there. The food was decent, but nothing like what I haven't had before.

There were 6 of us and we had ordered 5 dishes, with 2 more servings of rice, everyone was pretty full. I really really liked the duck dish that we got (it was gingery, forget the name though). The mushrooms were really good in both the chicken and the duck dish (couldn't say the same about the chicken). The pad see eww( I never order pad thai, i usually get this instead so I judge places by how they make these), was ok, a little on the saltier side, but still decent (we had got the vegetarian one so dunno how the meat ones would fair).

All in all, a good place, I would like to go again sometime. I was  glad it was open on christmas eve."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for dinner on a Friday night. Do yourself a favor and make reservations! The place is decorated nicely and has lots of culture on the walls.

One star loss for service- just my server. The rest of the staff seemed great. He was just not keeping up. Look, I don't demand much, but when I have to beg for a refill and I'm eating an 8 out of 10 level spicy meal...please, PLEASE keep the cup full. :)

I ordered the Tiger Cry Beef for an appetizer and it was freaking amazing. Perfectly cooked.

As my meal I ordered the Green Curry Mango Salmon. Looks like a sloppy mess- taste was on par. It was served with a side of rice but it didn't need it. It was very tasty- and relatively healthy if you don't eat the whole dang plate, but fair warning, that will be tough."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because this is the only true thai restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh, but I feel like it's a pretty good start and will give me high expectations for anywhere else I eat.  The spice levels seemed appropriate, and the food was delicious.  We got some appetizers that were so yummy, I almost didn't want my meal to come, but of course I was glad it did.  The portions are a good size and the price is reasonable as well.  I'd definitely recommend it to anybody willing to take a trip to the North Side of the 'burgh."}
{"text":"Very beautiful place - that is what you will notice the first thing you enter the restaurant. Every corner of the place is adorned in Thai decor which gives the place a very calming effect. We visited this place on a Sunday night and even with 30 mins left to close, they took us in and the place was still packed. We got the Crispy Roti for the appetizer and the Pork Red Curry with spice level 5 for the entree. I really loved the Crispy Roti and would recommend that you get it. It is a Chef special item and I can guarantee you will not find it at a lot of places. This is a rare dish to find. The Red Curry was also very good. It was just the right amount of spice and if you are used to having Indian curries, you should be fine. The quantity was also just right that you are able to finish it without wasting. Since we went on a very packed night and close to them closing, we had to wait a long time to get our food and in the rush, we were also accidentally served our Red Curry with Tofu instead of Pork which we later got replaced, which is completely understandable. So, maybe you want to catch them at a lesser peak time. I would still love to visit the place again for the food."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy noodle. It was tasty but it was way too oily. I removed all my noodle to another plate and there were at least 2-3 spoon of spicy oil, not including those oil on my noodle."}
{"text":"My first time eating at a Thai restaurant and I have to say this did a good job. Very tasty and the new place in Mt. Nebo is very nice. I will be returning."}
{"text":"What an oasis! We went into Nicky's Thai Kitchen on Friday and due to the small entrance of the restaurant I looked skeptically at the waiter who was going to bring us to outdoor seating.

Lo and behold a minute later we found ourselves in Thailand. There are a lot of props around you but it adds to the experience. A con was that we were seated at a table for two with the table umbrella exactly in the middle, which was cemented to the floor tho we just shifted our seats over.

Food errs on the cheap side for dinner generally speaking - $10 - $20 for entrees and under $10 for apps. Nicky's Thai Kitchen does not skimp on the portions. We ordered fresh rolls and I ordered the Beef Phad Phet. Delicious. Waiter was friendly and checked in on us periodically. I would be back to Nicky's Thai Kitchen though will be bringing back some wine."}
{"text":"Having enjoyed the Western Ave restaurant, I was thrilled to walk by and see Nicky's on Penn and Ninth. Wow, they are so not ready for business. 

We were seated with Lunch menus (at dinner time - we thought perhaps this site had lunch on one side & dinner on the other side so didn't ask) and not asked if we wanted anything to drink - I called the waitress back to request water and ginger tea. Someone else asked if we wanted appetizers, which were listed on the Lunch side, so after a moment of confused hesitation, we asked for the tofu with spinach & peanut sauce (okay). 

It wasn't until I asked if the curries on the lunch menu were available that they said we had the wrong menus, handed us dinner menus, and then stood there, as if we would be ready to instantly order off the huge dinner menu we hadn't yet read. At that point, with more/different options, we realized there was a different appetizer we would have preferred. I asked about the wild versus green mango curry, was advised to go with the green mango curry, and then was delivered plain mango curry. They admitted the mistake when they came to the table - when I asked what type of curry the mango curry was, the waiter said it's the same as the green curry only without the green color. Hmm. I am happy to try anything, and my friend's dinner was there of course, but I should have insisted they switch it for the correct dish. What I got had no flavor at all other than the hot pepper - and no ingredients other than mango and fried tofu (I'd specifically asked about the vegetables in the other curry dishes, so their absence was unwelcome). I'd asked for a 7 - it made my nose run a little, but I could discern no actual curry taste. I asked for some steamed broccoli to put in, which they brought, but it was mushy - and I still could not taste curry when I soaked the florets. Very odd. I should have sent the dish back and asked for something else - especially since they charged full price for their mistake (and I did not eat even half of the dish - and did not take any to go). They did not offered, even when they saw I wasn't eating the plain mango curry, whether I wanted the green mango curry entree I had ordered (though, at that point, we needed to get going anyway).

Very very disappointed with the service and food."}
{"text":"Had the Pad Thai and spicy flat noodles.  Great flavor, did not disappoint. Much better than other thai places in the city.  Cant wait to come back for lunch special and sit on outdoor patio space!"}
{"text":"The first thing that strikes me about this place is the decor. It's like walking into a mini Thailand. I really like the decorations.  The bar is set up in a separate room and is also really cool looking.  The staff is very attentive and I was seated quickly.  I ordered thai toast and another meal that I can't remember the name of. Both items were very good. I think you would be hard pressed to find better thai food in Pittsburgh.  

If you're in the mood for Thai food. You should definitely check this place out. 

I would like to make one suggestion to the owners. The cash register at the bar makes this crazy loud beep every time it prints a receipt.  It gets really annoying when you're sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Hands down best Thai in the city. They also know how to spice it up authentically. I've had a variety of options off the menu and have always been impressed. Also, this place is a sneaky great pick to go to pre-pirates or steelers as it is conveniently located a few blocks from the north shore."}
{"text":"The place doesn't look like much from the outside but it is quite spacious inside (I believe there is outdoor seating available but I was seated inside). 

The food was good (I had the mango curry seafood) and was prepared quickly. The staff was extremely friendly without hovering too much. 

Ambience was ok, maybe one step above perfectly casual."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dined here for lunch yesterday before visiting The Mattress Factory.  We sat out on the patio, which had such an interesting atmosphere, but in a good way and we loved it! The service was super speedy, and we never went without water (and we were drinking a TON of it). We ordered the fresh spring rolls for an appetizer and, although it wasn't my boyfriend's favorite, I thought it was very refreshing and delicious. I ordered the pineapple fried rice... it was one of the most wonderful things I've ever eaten. I could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. My boyfriend ordered the sweet and spicy chicken and also enjoyed his meal, but he said that he liked my choice better.  We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"They charge a 25% gratuity for large parties- for mediocre service. 

Food is great though."}
{"text":"I wanted a little nibble. I don't usually eat a lot, but here,  well, I could go all Miss Piggy. Especially on the Jasmine Coconut Rice. That stuff is so good, I could just eat that, and call it a night. Daughter loves it so much, I've seriously considered using it as a bribe. Hey, don't  judge me until you've had it, or need to motivate the kiddoes to clean their room, etc.

Tonight I ordered the Mint Grilled Beef Salad. Totally forgot with the delicate mint, that ordering it a \"7\" on a 1-10 spiciness scale would be a mistake. I took a couple bites, and ordered Jasmine Coconut Rice to help counteract the spice. I also sipped my Thai Green Ice Tea, which is sweet. Think of it as the Thai version of a dessert wine, but ice tea instead. Like an apertif.

The rice did the trick. This isn't the first time I've ordered that rice to pull the spiciness down, and it perfectly complements many dishes.

Guess what's for breakfast (I took a huge portion home)? The portion is so big, If always take about 80% home. It's great with marinated beef or pork, or grilled chicken. Might even be good with salmon or steelhead trout.

The server, a young, petite Asian female whose name I didn't understand,  was very nice, helpful and efficient. Very attentive,  without being intrusive.

I love it that though I was dining alone, the hostess didn't seat me in the worst possible seat. Rather, she asked if I preferred a table along the wall, and I said no; the table in the middle of the restaurant was fine."}
{"text":"Came in and the staff completely ignored me.  I finally made eye contact with someone on a register and asked for a table or where to go if this wasn't the host stand.  I just got an EXTREMELY rude \"uhuh\" and the woman buried her head into a computer.  So I just interpreted that as she was possibly in the middle of something I guess?

I could have totally misinterpreted her body language and vice versa.  However, then another staff members comes up to her and starts talking to the woman about something so irrelevant I can't even remember at the host stand and minutes go by...Still ignored.  Woman even turned her back to me.  

\"I will be with you in just one moment\" or something to that affect would have been great.  Or better yet, an acknowledgement of my presence in a slightly less rude of a tone? 

Too bad!  The place looked like some good eats.  Owell :(."}
{"text":"My beautiful bride and I came here for Valentines day weekend.  I made reservations ahead of time for 530pm and we actually got here right when they opened at 5pm.  There was already a line building up to get in here.  If you plan on coming here make sure to call ahead for reservations just to be safe.  Even though we were early they still sat us at our table right away.  It's a small dining room and it was packed.  So if you don't like eating in a small place maybe just order take out and go to a brewery.  Hey that's not bad idea!  Anyways we were seated and got comfy.

 We have been eating a lot of Thai food lately and we both have been in a wide noodles type of mood so that's what we ordered.  First we started with Spring rolls with shrimp in them that were delicious.  We were hungry and ate every roll with no problem.  Like I said we have been eating a lot of Thai and this was up there as one of the best rolls.  Carrie asked for their hot spices to whip up here own spice which turned out pretty good.  I used some it too for my rolls.

 It took about 15 to 20 minutes to get our main dish.  I ordered the Phad See Eaw and my wife ordered the Spicy Noodle.  Her dish was really good so check out her review on that.  My Phad See Eaw was good too.  I ate about half of it cause I wanted to leave some to take for home.  I'm glad that I did.  I thought my Phad See Eaw was a solid 4 at first.  I thought at another Thai restaurant my wide noodles were slightly better.  It wasn't until I got home and reheated my food the next day that I liked it even more.  I'm not sure why but sometimes reheated food does it for me and it sure did here.  It's a solid 5 just like a lot of our Yelp friends who love this place.

 Overall we had a very nice dinner here and we are looking forward to coming back soon.  It is a little small in there but it's not too bad and it's a decent price for a lot of food."}
{"text":"Very good food and ambiance. Small place but nothing short of excellent food. The banana split was just terrific."}
{"text":"Amazing food....great ambience...lovely staff....this is my second visit to Pittsburgh and I made sure to have their delicious food on the very first day :) we loved the spicy noodles, veg dumplings, basil fried rice and red curry!!"}
{"text":"I live in the War Streets, and I have to give a shout out to Nicky's Thai. I ordered the spicy peanut chicken, spicy level 5.  My girlfriend ordered something else. I picked it up 15 minutes later, and brought it home. I pulled the lid off and prepared to crush some Thai. I got some peanuts, chicken, and peppers on my fork and hungrily plowed them into my face, at  a medium pace. It was delicious.  I was going for a second bite, and very suddenly my forehead was as wet as Lake Elizabeth.  My mouth was ablaze. I ran to the sink to get water to get a small measure of relief. When I bent my head down to put my lips to the spigot, blood poured out of face hole.  I spit 4 teeth out, my gums were melting!!!  I started stuffing wash rags in my mouth, I lit a sparkler and chewed on it to cauterize the flow, I then gargled bleach.  I burst a few blood vessels in my left eye, and suffered minor hearing loss after a 20 minute bout of vomiting.  I am now recovering, doing well, and am slowly coming to peace with what happened.  I will order out again from Nicky's."}
{"text":"Panang curry and fresh spring rolls are awesome! Pad Thai and crab rangoons are also great. BYOB. Very cute patio area if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I have been waiting a long time to try this place and was so glad I did. I stopped here for lunch prior to my theater show. Place was empty so I was seated right away. They have small utensils but I loved the atmosphere as well as the service. If you order a luncheon entree you get a choice of their soup of the day or salad with a pineapple dressing.

I opted for the chicken teriyaki with mixed vegetables. It comes with white rice and took the salad. The salad was your traditional tossed salad but the pineapple dressing was out of this world good! My entree was generous and I knew I couldn't finish all that rice but I loved every bite of it. 

They do have dessert menu but I figured I'd save that till next time. Reservations are accepted but you probably don't need them for a Sat lunch. I would advise it more so for dinner since the place is small. The staff was very attentive to my needs.

What I also like is the fact that they ask you how spicy you want your food. I can't handle hot spicy food so I'm glad I can have it mild and enjoy it as well. Nicky's Thai kitchen has a second location over on the Northside which I will assume is just as good.

They do have a full bar area in the back if you are interested with TV sets.

Good food, great service, A definite must return!"}
{"text":"I didn't expect I could find a good Thai in Pittsburgh. Good foods and service. Some dishes are deviated from authentic Thai but they are within expectations. Hope they gradually shift to more authentic side as folks gradually understand Thai foods."}
{"text":"Went right at 3:00 pm. Walked in and was told they were closed. Yelp shows green \"open\" as I write this from Proper Brick Oven Pizza at 3:15 pm. Couldn't believe they didn't offer  to seat seat us. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Wow! I am speechless. I have been to so many Thai restaurant and so far this is the best I ever had.  The Chef Special menu is outstanding and nobody comes close.  We have Arun's Thai restaurant in Chicago but still this place is better."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing! I'm upset that their prices have tremendously shot up in the past year. You used to be able to eat here with a table of 4 for under $30. My boyfriend and I just ate there this past Friday evening and our meal was $60! I do recommend trying this place. But you must always call and make a reservation for dinner! this place is very small and can not hold that may people! The steamed dumping's are the best appetizer and they have very fresh and yummy won ton soup. The crab rice is also very delicious."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, but it's always crowded and a bit more expensive than other equally good Thai restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"BYOB for $5. The atmosphere here is very relaxing and comfortable, especially outside. Make sure to make a reservation because it fills up and stays busy throughout the night.

We ordered the steamed dumplings, thai toast, spring rolls, pad thai, and chicken and vegetable green curry. Everything was very fresh and you could tell that it was all made from scratch. I liked the fact that they ask you how spicy you would like your curry on a scale from one to ten. I was very impressed with Nicky's Thai Kitchen"}
{"text":"Food was good and the people packed in. Word is out that you can get real Asian food in the Burgh. It would have been a 5 star experience if the service matched. Unfortunately I had to repeatedly ask for water and then fight for my check. If you have all the time in the world then go ahead. At least the food will not disappoint."}
{"text":"I really love Nicky's Thai! I have only tried the massaman curry and a few appetizers, but everything I have had is very high quality and delicious. If you don't like spice, I don't recommend getting above a five spice level. I usually stick to a six because I like a little bit of spice. Also I definitely recommend dining in rather than take out as you definitely get a larger serving if you dine in."}
{"text":"I had my first Nicky's experience last night and thoroughly enjoyed it! This place is really cool and I will definitely be checking out their downtown location.

The restaurant itself is very small inside. I thought it was interesting that the host/hostess desk was situated in a spot with a full view into part of the kitchen. In a way, I guess this transparency should be appreciated--they have nothing to hide.

It was raining when my friend and I arrived, and we were quite confused when they asked if we preferred an inside or outside table. Once it was explained that the outside was covered, we decided to go with that option. No regrets! The garden area is really cute and unique. Lots of kitschy statues and a wide variety of plants made the area charming without being tacky. There was something oddly enjoyable about eating outside (under a roof) during a rain storm.

We started by splitting the crispy fried tofu which was served with a thick sweet and sour sauce. The portion was very generous (eight triangular pieces) and honestly I could have eaten the entire plate myself. They were delicious and I definitely recommend them!

Whenever I'm eating at a Thai restaurant for the first time, I like to order Pad Thai.. I guess it's sort of like a gauge for the quality of the restaurant. The portion was generous, but it was so good that I almost finished the entire thing (I was looking forward to having leftovers for lunch today, but just I couldn't stop!). They have a ten-point scale for spiciness, and at our waiter's recommendation I went with a four. It was fairly spicy--I could probably do a five next time, but it was spicy enough for my liking (and I DO like spicy foods quite a bit). 

The place is BYOB and the prices are reasonable. I'm not in the North Side too often but this place alone makes it worth the trip!"}
{"text":"We were extremely disappointed with the service at this establishment.
This place was unacceptable. 
Let's see, examples:

One waiter had overfilled a glass of water that had already been drunk out of, so he POURED THE GLASS BACK INTO THE PITCHER AND CONTINUED POURING INTO OTHER GLASSES. Imagine if that person had mono or was sick! The whole restaurant would get sick!

The waiters forgot our appetizer.

One waiter spilled curry on my friend's shirt and proceeded to ignore that it happened.

One waiter was pouring a glass of water and almost spilled it on my friends; she ducked to avoid it.

For both of our entrees, we asked for 4 and 6 spice level out of 10. Both had ZERO spices.

They first sat us down at a nice window table, but the hostess said that she set us down at a table that had been reserved. So she made us move one table over. Then one chair was too close to one of our chairs, so she made us move one chair over, but it made no sense because she could still sit there and have the chair moving. The reserved group came, drank a drink and proceeded to leave.

In conclusion, do not go to this restaurant if you want to live."}
{"text":"Came here to say the crab Rangoon is the best I've ever had,  by a mile.   What sets it apart is it's not too crunchy to deal with.   It is perfect. 

Had the red curry with chicken also,  it was very good. 

But the Crab Rangoon.   Mind blowing."}
{"text":"Good stuff! I had the pad see euw with tofu and it was a decent amount and yummy. I went here by myself and it was packed. Would love to eat on the patio again maybe in early fall with friends. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was my ol' wobbly table. I almost successfully wobbled a glass right off a' there. Would be back again. It seems like they have pretty authentic dishes."}
{"text":"\"Oh my god, when I die, please put one of their dumplings in my mouth and I'll be able to die happy!\" 

I know this is going to sound terrible, but I almost didn't want to write a review for Nicky's because it is so good that I didn't want to share it with everyone in Pittsburgh!  It's just that special!!  (Or at least my love of their dumplings is!)

Quick, caring service and great food.  I'm not a huge fan of super 10+ spicy food but according to others that if you order something that you want to clear your sinuses they'll give it to you!"}
{"text":"I go here every once in awhile with family. wish I could go more! it's affordable. Good service. it was jammed packed but, we were seated fast. I was in the mood for spicy thai chicken food. chicken was so moist and tender. Got a lot of veggies . veggies had a nice crunch along with slaw. nice, touch with fresh herbs. I got a seven, it builds up after a few bites but it a nice heat!"}
{"text":"Fantastic find! I'm in town for work this week and next, and found Nicky's on Yelp. What a find! First of all their patio out back is just gorgeous with all of the water fountains, plants, statues, and the umbrellas providing shade. I had their Chef's Special Garprow chicken lad kao and hve never had Thai food I liked as much as this dish. Also the chicken rice soup had wonderful cilantro flavors. I'm coming back next time I am town!"}
{"text":"The patio on this place is a hidden oasis. It's georgeous and relaxing despite being rather large. While a roof does cover the space, you still feel like you are dining outdoors in a lush Thai garden complete with a water feature. 

The food was really good. It's the most authentic Thai food I have tasted in the nicest of spaces. Normally the best food comes out of a hole in the wall dive, but the latter doesn't come anywhere close to describing this place. 

For appetizers I tried the crab rangoon. These slightly crispy wontons were stuffed with crab and cream cheese, the latter being the overwhelming flavor. They were served with what the menu called a pineapple sauce; while I found the sauce a great accompaniment, I didn't sense an overwhelming amount of pineapple. 

I also tried the Thai Toasts appetizer which was my favorite of the two. The presentation of this dish was really creative - they really were made to look like little mini finger sandwich triangles. 
These contained pork and a wonderful selection of spices. They were also a little crispy on the outside as they were fried in egg. They were served with a really light sauce (cucumber according to the menu). 

I ordered the pepper steak for my main (dine-in only). The meat was cooked to a medium well temperature I would say. It was thinly sliced and atop of pile of fresh veg. A large side of white rice completed the dish. 

I can't wait to come back and try something else from the rather extensive menu."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from this location. I will say, it is a little difficult to get someone on the phone to take your order. After three tries, we were successful. Three meals ran about $45. Which is a bit on the pricey end and is no big deal if the quality is there. Two orders of pad Thai and an order or kao soy. Everything ordered at heat levels 2 & 3 (out of 5) Nothing was spicy. The flavor of the pad Thai was ok. The chicken was very poor quality. Lots of gristle and very dry. The kao soy had good flavor, there just wasn't a lot of it. Small portion at full price. The noodles that come on the top are supposed to be crispy. Other places will package this part separately for a take out-out order, they did not do this. This dish, as with all the others, seemed to be lacking the chicken we ordered them to be made with... very little chicken. This certainly wasn't the best Thai I have ever had. I may come back and give them a second try, but I'm in no rush to pay for more disappointment."}
{"text":"This place has a beautiful interior and a quick-to-help staff; however, the food is not very consistent. One day you can get very good, authentic-tasting Thai food, and next week it could be something very different. Their spice levels are pretty accurate and tolerable. Being downtown, parking may be an issue, but there is a parking garage right up the street which is pretty big and about a 2 minute walk away from the restaurant!"}
{"text":"This experience was quite possibly one of the worst displays of customer service I've seen. We had a reservation...fine. We waited over 10 minutes to even be acknowledged when we walked in. 

Once we were seated, we looked over the menus and watched 4 different servers walk past us at least a dozen times. Not one of them stopped at our table. Not one of them would even look at us. After sitting there for 20 minutes being blatantly ignored, we walked out. 

We were prepared to spend a good amount of money on drinks, appetizers, and our meals. Instead I spent it elsewhere."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Its one of the best thai places I have ever been. I always take vegetarian options..flavors are amazing, the produce they use tastes so fresh. Portions are pretty good. I believe they have different menu for lunch and dinner options. Their spicy level is higher than usual so make sure u order less spicy level than ur usual preferred one. Ambiance and service both are pretty good. Their desserts are worth to check out!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful restaurant, but I suggest going in the spring or summer night and sitting outside on their beautiful patio. It's decorated with so many flowers and statues, and is a beautiful ambiance for such a great meal. I enjoyed their paid Thai with shrimp, which was slightly spicy and delicious. We also split a few appetizers, the pork dumplings and the egg rolls. Both were very good, and the dipping sauce with the dumplings was very savory and delicious. Definitely a spot I would want to visit again! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have heard great things about This place... Unfortunately I did not have a great experience. The food was good - I feel like I have had better Thai food in town... BUT the worst part was the actual dining experience. I met my friend for dinner. We both ordered drinks, soup, split spring rolls and then ordered a meal to take home for the next day. We had been there for an hour, we haven't seen each other in a long time, and they kicked us out! Because they had more people coming in. I'm sorry, but that was completely rude and it is why I will never go there again. It wasn't that we just sat there drinking water and took up hours and space. It was two people, we ordered more than enough and we were told we needed to leave after an hour to make room for others. Well? I'll never take a seat there again."}
{"text":"In town on business and this place was recommended. Did not disappoint!!  Had Thom Ku soup and Basil Chicken. Spiced perfectly to my request, servings were large, and service attentive. Good vibe in the place. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in the burgh. I eat here once a,week with co workers and we all love it...atmosphere is cute and service is great! The pineapple curry and spicy noodle are my favorites."}
{"text":"We are from Kansas visiting to watch our beloved Steelers beat the Browns!!! Everything was delicious and very fresh, highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places in Pittsburgh. I always come here when my family visits. This place got great atmosphere and the service was great. Even though the glasses provided were very small, the waiter never once failed to fill up my water. I've been here twice now, both times with family. My family asked to come to this place again because the curry they had previous time was the best they've ever had. They got the same things again - yellow curry and mango curry with pineapple in there. Mmm they both enjoy their food so much, they left Pittsburgh with food comas. Everything I tried from appetizers (we got the veggie one) to entrees (duck curry, pad see ew, and larb gai), I am super satisfied with so I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"No one does Thai food quite like Nicky's. I've been to many Thai restaurants all around Pittsburgh, and I can honestly say that none even come close. Without question, Nicky's Thai Kitchen is one of my absolute FAVORITE restaurants! 

The decor is unique and elegant, giving the restaurant its traditional Thai ambiance. Absolutely incredible sculptures and artwork! The food is high quality from the preparation down to the ingredients. Additionally, the menu is very vegetarian and vegan friendly! I have tried many of their different appetizers and entrees, but nothing beats the Phad Thai and the Phad See Eaw. The BEST noodle dishes I've ever had! Insanely delicious and flavorful, plus it comes in large portions.
 
Since this is a popular spot, the restaurant can get congested and loud plus, there can be a wait if you don't throw in a reservation. The employees are usually running from table to table, so service can be slow, but in my opinion, it's a small price to pay for an amazing meal. If you are unfortunate enough to have never experienced Nicky's Thai Kitchen, drop everything and get some Phad Thai!!"}
{"text":"The Tom Kha soup was amazing and my curry noodles were very delicious. I'm looking forward to my leftovers and to going back to try more from the menu!"}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant for Pad Thai in Pittsburgh. I always order extra chicken."}
{"text":"I've had Thai food all over the city and Nicky's remains at the top of the list. The soups are perfection. When I worked in Greentree they would make deliveries to our office and the food was as fresh as if we were at the restaurant. Get the spring rolls!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really good! I just went here for the first time a week ago! 

1/23/16: We went on a Saturday night and didn't have a reservation but luckily they seated us at the bar, which was very comfortable for the two of us. Their menu is huge! I had such a hard time picking out what to order. For an appetizer I ordered the Chicken Satay and it was delicious! They gave me like 6 pieces of chicken! The sauces that came with it were very good as well. For my dinner I had the Cashew Chicken. It came with white rice in this beautiful golden bowl. The cashew chicken had a great sweet red pepper chili taste! 

5/9/16: I took my dad here and he was incredibly impressed. He had never had such authentic Thai food in his life. Of course I had the cashew chicken again but we shared the banana and coconut dessert and it was delicious! This place just can't be beat! The best Thai food in Pittsburgh and probably on the East Coast!

The servers are very helpful but they're a little hard to understand sometimes. Other than that, the food and atmosphere here is great!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my husband and some friends last night.  I think I had tried the North Side location a few years ago for lunch, but it wasn't very memorable. 

My husband and I both could not resist the Pad Thai combo which comes with shrimp and chicken pad thai, 3 skewers of chicken satay with accompanying sauces, tom kha shrimp soup, and two dumplings.  I ordered it at a 10 while my husband ordered his Thai hot.  The waiter was very concerned that it would be way too hot for us, but I am happy to report that the 10 was actually a 10! Most places I can order a 20 and still need to add chili.  Here the sauces were flavorful and hot! The Tom Kha was amazing!  

The service was great and the drinks were constantly full. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This was wonderful for a nice quiet lunch. 

We sat inside overlooking the outdoor space. 

What we had: 

Chicken Satay (good grilled flavor and the satay sauce was delicious!)
Spicy Noodle Lunch Special (very good flavor and nice and spicy like I asked for)
Pad Thai (a great version!  Peanuts were on the side to make it easy to add as much or as little as you wanted!)

Food was good and service was quick.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Exceptional food, gracious service, and a great atmosphere.  Truly a gem, highly recommend the pineapple curry with a Thai Island Iced Tea :). Nicky's was recommended to us when we passed through Pittsburgh, we will be stopping in for lunch on our way back...we might have to order some extra to bring home too.  I'd like to consider myself something of a connoisseur of Thai food having eaten at many restaurants across our fine nation and in Thailand--Nicky's has hands down the best curry I've ever had.  I really wish it were close to me."}
{"text":"It really pained me to write that 3 star review a month back, but I stayed committed to Nicky's just like Nicky's has stayed committed to good food and service! So after some bumps along the way, I think this downtown location has smoothed things out to run the great business they are! Service this time around was stellar with no complaints!

I just can't stop saying how much I love the space in general. It's gorgeous! Great for a date night or just catching up with your lady friends. Funny enough, it's so dimly lit that the servers will give you a flashlight to read your menu! Hysterical and thoughtful.

I'm really coming into my own with Thai food and was excited to order the Green Curry, as it's my latest obsession (I know, Thai food two days in a row here!). It was fabulous. The spice level is always a little iffy, meaning you never really know what you'll get even when you order the same level every time you come in. I ordered a 5 on the spice scale and got maybe a 6. I know, not that big a deal, but I was definitely reaching for my water glass!

It had loads of veggies mixed with a creamy coconut sauce. I also like that you can order brown rice. This certain brown rice I've never seen before. It's very dark and is actually cooked so that it pretty much has the same texture of white rice. You can still taste the brown rice flavor, but I've never had such fluffy brown rice before. 

I have a feeling this place is going to fast become my new downtown go to spot. Add that pending liquor license and you'll compete for my dollars with Meat and Potatoes!"}
{"text":"I finally went back to NIcky's after almost a year! Time flies when you're having fun. Or taking time to eat my way through Pittsburgh. Irregardless... I believe the last time I was here I sorta wanted to be impressed more. This time, I was!

I went all in and swayed from my usual Pad Thai and get crazy with another menu choice. Okay, I admit it wasn't super crazy. It was still a noodle dish, but hey, you gotta start somewhere, right? I ordered the Phad See Eaw, which is rice noodles with stir fried broccoli and sweet soy sauce. I 'm always into the shrimp, so I had to add some into the dish. 

And you know what? It was awesome! Maybe better than the Pad Thai. Wait, it was better than the Pad Thai! Huge portion, enough to enjoy the next day. Now I'm excited to go back and try other dishes. Since there's a new location downtown it will give me that much more of an excuse to head down there to \"try\" the new joint out. 

Hot Tip: BYOB and they do take reservations. We went on a Friday night and it was packed for such a tiny place, so remember to plan ahead!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. I got the beef hung something curry with spice lvl 4 (I like spicy food), and they come out really good. The beef is cooked pretty well, the curry has a thick umami broth that comes from the spices, coconut milk, and peanuts. It comes with chicken noodle soup/salads too, which is great. The server is nice and attentive. This is probably one of the best thai food I ever visited."}
{"text":"We choose Nicky's from the yelp website. We also love Thai. The host was polite, funny and we sat down quickly. The menu was great. Mrs went with the Thai fried rice and I ordered a chicken special. Our orders came out quick but this is where the problem started. My wife had a piece of metal shaving almost three inches long in her food. Thin and sharp. Well it was from a metal scrubber, we were told they used these metal brillo/pot scrubbers. It wasn't much of a surprise so I assume this had happened before. But what if my wife would of swallowed that? 
I hit the men's room before leaving, a male employee was in the stall. When I came in he walked right out, I held the door and he left without washing his hands. As good as the food was we would not go back if it was free! There are some issues at Nicky's someone needs to look into the terrible careless employees!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant. I've had at least half the menu but always end up going back to the red curry. It's a better value for lunch and the soup that comes with the entree is really nice (not included with dinner). Whenever I'm in Pittsburgh Nicky's is must."}
{"text":"I love Nicky's!  Every time my friends ask me where I want to go for dinner they always laugh when I say Nicky's because it's my automatic response.  From the kind and friendly service, to yummy food, Nicky's is never a disappointment.  

My favorites are the pad see ew (sp?) and the pineapple fried rice. Yummm!"}
{"text":"They serve very good lunches here. Make sure you go early or you will not get a table. Their spice level is not really hot."}
{"text":"I called in an order of Rama tofu to go. Initially, there was some confusion about if it was sold on the lunch menu or not, but after that was cleared up, my food was ready in 15 minutes as promised. 

I ordered medium spicyness, but it was mild at best. There was a good ratio of sauce to veggies & rice. The Rama tofu and the salad it came with were both very tasty. If I'm in the area & have a chance to eat here again, I will ask for it to be a little spicier."}
{"text":"Dropped by here last minute with a friend for a nice dinner. She had heard really good things about this places and so she dragged me along. They close from 4-5 just FYI in between the end of lunch and to prep for the beginning of dinner. So we had to walk around downtown a bit but I would say that the wait was definitely worth it! We got an appetizer of egg rolls which were pretty good and flavorful even without the sauce. And she got green curry and I got red curry! The serving sizes were pretty decent but I didn't like how they gave us a bigger bowl of rice to share, rather than our own individual bowls. But the curry themselves were super delicious and the rice was perfectly cooked.

The service was weird but oddly really attentive. Like even if I took a sip of my drink, they'd come to refill it right away, which I'm not complaining about. That was nice. But the waiter who took our order and the waiter who refilled our drinks and the waiter who took our plates away, were all different people so I didn't really know where my tip was going. . . or who I was supposed to ask when we needed something. But I mean we were taken care of, so I guess that's what's important.

This place is a little pricey, but then again it's downtown and it was for dinner. So that's somewhat expected. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I had heard that this was the \"best Thai food in Pittsburgh\" so I wanted to try it out and decide for myself. I came last week and tried the Tom Kha soup and the Kao Soi. Both were good but not quite as flavorful as I am used to. Eating the Kao Soi was a bit of a challenge as it was served in a giant chalice-like bowl (I'm sure there is a name for it that I just don't know). It was too high to eat directly out of the bowl, but since it was a bit soupy, I couldn't exactly move it onto my plate. Aside from this minor point, everything else was good, but it wasn't quite good enough to become my favorite. I do want to come back when the weather is better though so I can check out the patio!"}
{"text":"I can't believe my favorite thai food is found in Verona.  Lucky for me I spent part of  my  youth in this town and am familiar, but this is pretty shocking for this small town.  I was a little disappointed I didn't get to write the first review.  I've been here a few times and the owner is a really nice guy who you can occassionally find waiting on tables when he isn't cooking.  They've done a good job of trying to make this place a little bit more pleasant for in-house dining, but I usually do take out.  They have a few good tables on the sidewalk with big umbrella's to block the sun and they also have a bunch of potted plants which is a nice touch.  If you kind of squint your eyes you can almost forget that most of the view is a closed down pizza shops, some shabby housing plans and a dumpy bar.  The inside is nice enough with the required pictures of the hindu gods and a map of the world.  They have about 8 tables.  I'd guess the room could seat about 25, but it would be extremely loud and cramped quarters.  I've taken staff here and ate outdoors and the service was good.  I wanted to try something different today, so I tried one of the specials.  It was duck with very crisp vegetables, lots of ginger, and green beans.  It was served with a curry sauce, but unlike most thai curries  it didn't have coconut milk in it.  It was delicious.  The sauce was one of the best I've ever had.  There wasn't a lot of duck and overall the portion quite frankly was on the small side for a thai restaurant.  But, the flavor is an A +.  In the past I've ordered \"very hot\" which is supposed to be just under \"Thai Hot\", but I didn't find it that spicy, so today I ordered thai hot and it was perfect.  I suggest you get a little courageous and get the \"thai hot\".  The rice is fine and the complimentary egg roll is not good.  I suggest you skip the egg roll and stick wih the entree.  The egg roll really has no ingredients in it that I can decipher and just tastes like a piece of fried dough.  The wonton soup and lemongrass soup which I've tried in the past are both fine, but Nicky really seperates himself with the flavors of his main dishes.  The pork dumplings are wonderful maybe the most flavorful I've ever tried and not as heavy as these dumplings usually are.  The City Paper reviewers gave this place 4 stars and the PG's notoriously tough food critic China Millman gave 2 stars which is considered \"very good\".  This is worth a 20 minute trip out of the city.  Verona isn't much to look at.  It's pretty much considered the red headed step child of Oakmont, but after dinner you  can pass on through a 1/2 mile to Oakmont and walk along the beautiful storefronts and check out some of the unique shops in Oakmont."}
{"text":"Nicky's seems to be \"the\" thai place to at least try out in Pittsburgh and it didn't disappoint! 

Food: Anytime I go to Thai places, it's so hard to order outside of the pad thai. Most in our group went was thinking the same and got the chicken, shrimp and veggie with varying spice levels. My veggie was FULL of fresh veggies and the sauce was super light and refreshing. Others got the pumpkin curry, chicken teriyaki, wonton soup and all cleaned their plates. Next time I am eager to order other fresh spring rolls, fat noodles and a curry as they all looked so good coming out of the kitchen!

Drinks: BYOB which is always nice. $5 cork fee per wine bottle and 50 cents per beer bottle

Atmosphere: Outdoor patio is great! Covered top and lots of greenery around. Our party of 10 sat comfortably in the back. 

Value: $13.75 is quite pricey for pad thai, however, the BYOB helped in keeping the whole cost of the bill down."}
{"text":"If you like Thai food, you have to try this place! Their shrimp pad Thai is amazing and the restaurant has such a nice vibe to it. Definitely one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I've ever had, perfectly balanced flavorful savory dishes served in an attractive atmosphere by friendly staff, thai food perfection!"}
{"text":"Lunch was excellent. Maybe my new Thai favourite now.  The green curry was excellent! They don't hold back on their spice. If you ask for a 10/10 spice, you are forewarned."}
{"text":"Amazing! Not much more to say other than the fact that the food is wonderful and the service was good."}
{"text":"Is Nicky's or Smiling Banana the best thai restaurant in Pittsburgh?

I would go with SB, but honestly this place is a little bigger, has a better patio, and is a little less busy. Really though both are solid and if you were going to drive for Thai I would say that when I lived downtown I would not have driven to Highland Park and now that I live in Morningside I am not driving to Nicky's. Both are great in a city low on Thai food. Bring on the spicy noodles."}
{"text":"My favorite place downtown to get Thai food! 

I'm a fan of the Pad Cha and Pad Phet combo meals and the soups are always delicious. Crab rangoon and spring rolls are great ways to start the chow session. Usually able to get in, order, eat and pay within an hour if you're going on a lunch break. Flavors are great here and the wait staff is pretty consistent with refilling water but often forget if you order a different drink. Spice levels range from 1-10 or 1-5 depending on the waiter. Ask for them to bring out the sauce tray for even more flavor. You used to get larger portions where you would almost always have some left to take home, but they've decreased the amount of food given. You also get even less food if you order takeout. Save the rangoon for last! Be careful sitting by the front window as there are almost always flies buzzing around up there."}
{"text":"This is the best thai food I've ever had. With that being said, I placed a to go order over the phone then got there a couple minutes early to grab a drink. I sat there for about 10 minutes during a semi busy time and was never greeted so I decided to go across the street to have a beer while I waited. Although the service wasn't good, it's great food. I would recommend just doing to go and be prepared for leftovers. It's a lot of food."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh - it is my go-to when I want Thai food.  I've gotten take out and dine in the restaurant and I've gotten consistent quality with the food every time.  I love their Pad Thai and the Spicy Peanut is another favorite of mine.  I order everything from there \"Thai\" hot and it is usually just the right heat for my palate.  I also like the crab fried rice,  Phad See Eaw, and the Sriracha Seafood Noodle Soup.  You really cannot go wrong with any dish that you order there.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good food, nice staff. I asked for their vegan options and the host provided a solid list of options. I would have given it a 5 if my meal wasn't so oily. Each piece of tofu was super huge and hard to cut with a fork due to the breading used for frying."}
{"text":"Panang curry was very good. I love that it had a ton of red pepper, green pepper and broccoli. Curry had a good flavor and perfect spice at a level 5. The choice of soup or salad with lunch is great. With a water, my meal was right around $8.50."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Pittsburgh, and although I didn't have a lot of time to spare, Nicky's Thai Kitchen was worth the wait. I ordered a spicy shrimp dish, and it was delicious. The wonton soup and sake was amazing also. This restaurant is a place you MUST try if you're searching for an authentic experience."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite! My coworkers and I often went for lunch. Unfortunately, the spice levels have become very inconsistent, especially if you order a 3 (out of 5). The biggest disappointment though is how insanely long it has taken us to get our food the last few times. Twice, we ordered take-out and waited an hour! (for only 2 dishes!)"}
{"text":"Plenty amount of food. Very yummy curry and chef's speciality. But long time to wait for the cuisine"}
{"text":"This was our first time at this location. Normally we went to the one in the city of Pittsburgh. It is very clean and the decor is on point. Much more space for seating here. Very efficient staff. We never had an empty glass of water. Great chef specials too. We felt that the spice scale wasn't quite aligned with our orders.  I requested a 2/5 and my husband 3/5 and mine was more spicy.  He also got a big hunk of sugar in a bite he had so something's wasn't cooked all the way through. Other than that, food was good. We will give it another go."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food. Turns out our server was from Bangkok and we spoke with him a bit about our travels to Thailand. He was very curious about how the food was in comparison and I'd say that this place is very close to authentic Thai food. In fact, the pad thai (which I haven't had in a long time), was better than some of the street food versions of this dish  consumed in Thailand.

So yes - the Pad Thai is an excellent choice - it has a slight kick with just the right amount of sweet and salt. It's a bit oilier than other versions of the noodle dish, but it works...the oil gives it more moisture. Chicken satay was delicious and the green curry was terrific. The only thing that was odd about the curry: the chicken took on the color...it was green. I've never seen green chicken before...so that threw me off a bit.

Mixed drinks were nice; they had a few specials and I tried the Mango Sangria (with red wine; there's a choice of red or white). Went down easy and fast.

Thankfully we arrived before the rush. By the time we left, there weren't any tables available."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to visit this restaurant for a while and have never made it there. Well after my wife went to their new downtown location and raved about how good it was well we made time. We went on New Years Eve for a little new year Thai food.

Everything was very good. I had the Grilled Duck Curry which came in a brass looking bowl with candle underneath to keep everything warm and a bed of rice to accompany it. 

We also had some sweet potato samosa and some crab rangoon both were delicious. 

Nicky's has great food and when it's not freezing outside you can sit on the back patio which is hear is pretty nice. Do yourself a favor and give it a go."}
{"text":"Went with a friend after work and sat outside- would definitely recommend!  It's a very nice atmosphere, the staff were very attentive and the food was very good for the price, in my opinion."}
{"text":"We have been coming for over a year and are always happy with our meal and service. 
Wine and beer prices are very good. Lower than most places in Pitt for such a nice Restaraunt. 
Spice is there is you ask for super Thai hot. Very nice.

Above all, the largest problem with Nicky's is that the curry is made with fish sauce and shrimp paste. I have been to hundreds of Thai places without fish sauce and nothing is lacking.

Ditch the fish and 5 stars is within reach."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an upscale, authentic Thai restaurant than look no further. You will be in for a sure treat. This place is amazing. My husband and I went to Nicky's for the first time last weekend and absolutely loved it. You will definitely not leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Went with my family this summer. We love Thai, but damn the spice levels make the food uneatable. order HALF your usual spice level. The pad thai was good, and make sure you sit on the patio. Get the Pad Thai. Yes, Paid Thai. Do it. That & Thai Tea. Yum!"}
{"text":"Anyone who says Nicky's Thai isn't the best value downtown is a bold faced liar. Any dish stands up to the best Thai food I have had anywhere and especially in Pittsburgh. You can complain about the lunch rush or small dining area all you want. Shut your trap unless you have another samosa to cram down your gullet. The waitstaff is accommodating, friendly and knowledgeable. Now, who is up for a saki bomb?"}
{"text":"Superb dining experience from all staff.   Caring and very prompt.  Food was absolutely delicious !  Very very tasty plate soft and crunchy rolls followed by red curry chicken soup.  Nice clean atmosphere.  Little chilly air temp but hey, can't have it all.  I will be returning very soon."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is the best dish ever.  Usually when I get something different at a Thai restaurant I usually regret not getting the Pad Thai.  Last night was different.  I ordered the Spring Roll Deluxe, Tom Kha Soup and Glass Noodle Salad.  Everything was delicious,  I was worried about the Glass Noodle Salad, I'll be getting this again.  I did not regret not getting the Pad Thai.  I also got a little bit of Garlic Chicken leftovers the following day."}
