{"text":"Like others have reviewed, you really don't feel like you're in a hotel bar here.  Came here with my date for one of their jazz nights just to hang out and have a drink between dinner and dessert.  Parked in the hotel basement ($6) and got a table up in the bar area; all of the tables in the lobby were already taken.  The jazz was good and my date's drinks were good as well.  

One downside though; due to medical problems, I can't drink alcohol so I ordered a Diet Coke while my date ordered his mixed drinks.  Ordered 2 Diet Cokes during our time there and when the bill came, I was actually charged $4 for each small glass (the soda was served in a 10oz size wine glass).  Now I know that this is a bit upscale and all, but $8 for 20oz of soda?  Really?  Those prices were worse than when I was living in France and could buy a whole bottle of local wine for the same price of a 12oz Coke.  My date's mixed drinks were only slightly more expensive."}
{"text":"Good Music and nice selection of food. The staffs are great and very nice open bar concept to lobby. I'm glad they have grass fed sliders and organic greens!"}
{"text":"Do NOT go for happy hour. 

Bartender was rude and not the least bit helpful. 
We went after work for a drink. After waiting at one of the tables for a couple of minutes without service, I walked up to the bar. I asked what their happy hour specials were. The bartender sighed and and said he wasn't sure. Then he looked at a sheet and said some beers and maybe wine were $3 to $4. He didn't specify which brands and seemed annoyed that I was even asking. 

My co-workers went in the past and had a similar, if not worse experience.

I will not be back. There are much friendlier and better places downtown."}
{"text":"Visited Andy's a while ago and loved it for its music and ambiance. I would go back anytime for a drink but not for food. The dinner was overpriced for the quality presented. For a meal I would give it a 2 but as a jazzy bar hang out a definite 4, it's nice to have a little places like this to go to after work."}
{"text":"Hotel bar desperately trying to be a foodie and mixologists heaven. Fails miserably on both. Overpriced. Food is mediocre at best. The mixologist drink specials are laughable. Do not waste your time here."}
{"text":"Stopped in just for the live jazz. The venue has a real classy vibe and the band was very good. They serve wine by the glass at very reasonable prices. Parking is a nightmare but we found a garage near by. Great location for date night"}
{"text":"I stopped in Andy's for a quick drink. It's a really fancy place, located in The Fairmont. I was disappointed in their wine selection for how expensive it is - there wasn't much variety. I had a simple white wine blend (mid-priced at $10 a glass). I'll most likely go back again, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I am a bit perplexed by the reviews proclaiming that Andy's does not feel like a hotel bar.  It is a fairly typical hotel bar that you would expect to find in  a modern/boutique hotel.  Andy's is right off of the main lobby and extremely bright.  Andy's could actually stand to dim the lights a bit, to be quite honest.  

I have no idea what the cocktail scene is like in Pittsburgh, but I don't think I would opt for Andy's as a destination if I were not staying at the Fairmont."}
{"text":"Great live blues / jazz music. Service is good as well. But I'm a huge food fanatic and the food is only ok and limited. But I guess you shouldn't expect much from a hotel bar/restaurant.  Eitherway I had a good overall experience just wasn't impressed with the menu. But if you want to stop in for a quick drink listen to some good music and maybe impress a girl good spot to go."}
{"text":"When I moved to Pittsburgh a year ago, I crossed state borders with the assumption that the Steel City's night-life (especially the live music scene) would be lacking. While our city could do some work on offering late night dining, the live music scene happily surprised me. One of the first places that I sought out live music in Pittsburgh was at the Fairmont Hotel on Fifth Avenue. The bar at the Fairmont is called Andy's, and it's everything that you want from a hotel bar: large, professional, and true to Pittsburgh. Named after Andy Warhol himself, Andy's doesn't just know how to make a great Manhattan and give off a contemporary-art vibe. They also serve a fulfilling American and offer live jazz music throughout the week (http://andyswinebar.com/jazz/). It gets even better, though. After several months of living in Pittsburgh, I realized that most downtown restaurants close fairly early (10pm on weeknights, or midnight on weekends). When I have found myself in a pinch and starving during late hours, I have always been able to strike gold at the bar at Andy's. They serve food past midnight!

The bar environment is quiet, friendly, and professional. This is the kind of bar that you go to when you don't feel like talking to anyone. At the same time, I have met some fascinating people at Andy's since it is in the Fairmont. The bartenders do make a mean Manhattan (my favorite drink) and they have a variety of alcohol's available.

The food menu is diverse, offering a variety of American fare items. Being vegetarian, Andy's Wine Bar strikes gold for me again because they serve a fantastic veggie burger! My favorite part though, is that when you ask for condiments (ketchup, mustard, and mayo), they give it to you in glass baby Heinz jars. So cute! I'm weird and save the jars because I have this obsession with all things Pittsburgh and happen to live in the Heinz Lofts! (Read my review on the Heinz Lofts, here: https://www.yelp.com/biz/heinz-lofts-pittsburgh)

Andy's is a great place to unwind after a long day at work, meet some new folks visiting Pittsburgh at the bar, enjoy live music, or enjoy late night dining. I highly recommend Andy's to professionals in the city. It's a breath of fresh air, after trying so many equally wonderful but very different restaurants and bars in Pittsburgh.

Enjoy!

{"text":"Tucked behind a towering crystal staircase in the downtown Pittsburgh Fairmont, this place is more of a bar that sells some wine, than a wine bar. Noise reflects easily off the polished floors and the back-lit bar. We popped in on a Thursday night for a drink and there was a live jazz band playing. Tall blue plush seats, swivel by the windows and 4 tops cradle the lobby allowing for 360 views of clients sipping cocktails and enjoying the music. What was missing was a good list of wines. The sole cardboard menu on the table showcased their wines by the glass, to which we were told were alllll of their wines, and a bottle just costs 4 times that price? We opted for a Malbec, that was drier than normal, much darker and tannic.....odd choice for the representative bottle on your list. Either way, if you want a classy cocktail or are staying in the Fairmont, this local is a sleek stashed away oasis for a quick cocktail. I might hit up one of the near by $$$ Italian restaurants for a better wine selection."}
{"text":"Not your typical hotel bar!  This place is really cool and mellow yellow. We have been there twice but our experience last night warranted a review. My bf loves jazz and i like cocktails so we decided to have a grown up  night at Andys. We got there at around 8:30/9 and parked in the hotel basement ($6). The seats by the lobby were all taken (friday night) but we got a table at the bar area. They have a range of unique cocktails, some beer and vino. They also have a mini food menu. Cocktails range between ($9-$12). The bloody Mary is amazing!!!!!! seriously!!!! probably the best i have had...I also got the pop art martini and it was also pretty good(gave me the buzz i was yearning for).  My bf tried the Bellini Manhattan (comes in a martini glass) and it was done pretty well too. He also got a local beer.  We ordered some chips and guac and hang out until the music stopped. The crowd was eclectic. Not too dressy ..i spotted some jeans and tennis shoes...  I didn't feel out of place neither did the Bf. There were mostly older couples when we first got there and then later it got younger( not douchey). It was very relaxed and mellow. Our waitress was great. We ordered a dessert at 11:10 (kitchen closes at 11) but they were able to accommodate us. Ps that dessert was amazing (Kahlua torte with vanilla bean cream) we devoured it with a glass of champagne and some irish coffee.  The band stopped playing at 11 at which point they played jazzy tunes in the background. They also have a large TV that played the hockey game (on mute).  If your looking for a mellow night over some cocktails or just a place to drop by after work, dinner or before a big night out then this is definitely a place to check out!!  Did i mention that its mellow? 
We both loved it and I think we will be regulars."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed. 

When entering the Fairmont, the bar is all the way in the back of the lobby. There are steps up to the bar but otherwise, the bar is not really separate from the lobby. A few tables were scattered around the bar and the atmosphere and decor were nice: very modern. Despite this fancy-hotel-bar-feel, the drinks and service did not impress me. Drinks were expensive and the signature cocktails I've tried weren't memorable. Additionally, the service my table received made the experience even less enjoyable. Our server had something smart to say after everything. Maybe this was just his personality, but this kind of attitude just didn't make a guest feel welcomed. I didn't really appreciate a sarcastic and smart aleck server when I was paying nearly $15 for my drink. 

I try to avoid Andy's but unfortunately, it's close proximity to my office means that I'll probably return for happy hour in the future. Hopefully my next experience will be better."}
{"text":"Where can you go to hear great jazz, drink super cocktails, be served by very special people and listen to great live performers of American jazz? Andy's Wine Bar, that's where. Also, there is no cover charge. The menu provides many options fo all."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best places for people watching. It has a nice bright modern decor. I had a few glasses of sparkling wine, which hit the spot as a nightcap. The bartenders are friendly and engaging. Live jazz is almost always playing, but honestly the crowd is more entertaining than the music!"}
{"text":"I love this bar! It's pretty affordable and has such a cute vibe to it for being right in the middle of the city. I love the view as well, since the whole lobby area is all glass, you really feel like you're in downtown and not just anywhere. I also think that even the bar is \"classy\", it definitely comes off as \"accessible\".  They also have live music most nights, I think, and if you want food or a quick drink before a show or ice skating, then I highly recommend a visit to Andy's. 

My secret tips:
- Plan a visit during the winter. The Fairmont puts free hot chocolate out in the lobby during the winter and my goodness, it's amazing. It's worth the trip alone! Don't believe me? Try it for yourself and tell me I'm lying!
- Steal their coasters. They have cute little sayings on them and could be framed. No kidding!
- Ask for the \"bananas fonda\" drink. Don't ask, just do.

Enjoy! :)"}
{"text":"I loved this little bar at the hotel!  bartender Bianca was fantastic!! she made excellent drinks and is a very nice person!  i had french martini with grey goose and my boyfriend had couple of different drinks and they all were great!  we also had some food..the tuna burger and salad was delicous...if you want great drinks and good snack food..go here!  if you're staying at the fairmont hotel def take a walk to the lobby and have a drink!!"}
{"text":"\"The idea of waiting for something makes it more exciting.\" - Andy Warhol

Andys Wine Bar had that quote by Andy Warhol printed on its menu, and when he saw it my husband joked that he guessed that means the service would be slow. Well, he was right! We ordered wine and a cheese plate, and we had long finished our wine by the time the cheese was brought out 30 minutes later. The server was like \"you want some bread or something with that?\" We were like, um, yeah, the menu said it comes with bread. So then we waited a few more minutes for bread. The same confused server also wrongly tried to deliver to us a dessert we didn't order.

It's worth noting that the bar is in a hotel, which I did not know based on the ads I had seen for it - I'd wanted to check it out for a while after reading about it in the LivingPittsburgh.com newsletter I subscribe to. It's also worth noting that the average age of customers was probably 65 - I don't know if that's because of a specific event that was going on or if that's the usual clientele.

The wine and cheese were good, the atmosphere was nice and we enjoyed the music, but the service was pretty unfortunate. I would like to go back again and see if this was just an off-night for them. It was a Saturday night so they were pretty busy."}
{"text":"This is a good spot to meet up with friends, serve as a jump off for date night or just to chill. Since the bar is located in the Fairmont lobby, there are multiple seating options away from the bar as well. There is a wide variety of wines and craft cocktails made with fresh ingredients. Since this was the first stop of the evening and I was hangry, I loved that they provided complimentary popcorn and pork rinds. Score!

The service here is great and if you can't decide, they ask questions to help steer you towards a great decision.  Side conversation with the bartenders was great as well...they were so friendly! The blackberry sour I had was fresh and fruity with the pop of muddled blackberries on the bottom and a hint of peach. This was a great 1st experience and I'm looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Located inside the Fairmont Hotel. Very nice and upscale. . Live Jazz on Wednesdays thru Saturdays. Ordered food from the bar menu. I had the hamburger sliders. Very good. The negatives.... bar area is very small and place is very expensive but that is what you get in an upscale downtown hotel bar. Not a shot and a beer place. Great place to stop in for a drink if you are in cultural district ... all dressed up and want to have a drink with that special someone."}
{"text":"I used to stop in over a year ago after the ballet or symphony and found it a pleasant experience. Since moving back, I tried it several times again and found the experience pretty bad. I like the atmosphere but the service was terrible both times. Will try again someday in the distant future  when hopefully things will improve again. There are far more better places in downtown Pittsburgh that seem to appreciate their customers. I can excuse most things but not unnecessary rudeness."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time; at times the bartender is more interested in side work; but the crowd is always entertaining and a joy to sit at the bar to people watch."}
{"text":"Andy's is nice enough for a hotel bar, but nothing special.  The cosmo and old fashioned I tried there both were just average.  The main flaw of the bar is the floor plan.  There is a wall that keeps the bar unnecessarily cut off from the lobby...This also keeps the tables too close and makes the bar feel claustrophobic--a difficult task in a hotel as grand as the Fairmont.  The live jazz is a nice touch, but certainly not the best jazz in the city."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my Sunday afternoon with a few friends and coworkers. The drinks were pricey but tasty and good and we were able to order wings which were also great. Service was good and the atmosphere is quite quaint tucked back beyond the grand entrance of their fantastic entrance to the Fairmont !!!"}
{"text":"Great place for live Jazz. The musicians are always top notch. The wine list is somewhat limited,  but there are some very good choices on the list. This is a fun place to visit and it's quite elegant. They have recently extended the number of evenings for live music from Tuesday to Saturday evening.  No cover charge."}
{"text":"Perfect atmosphere to unwind after a long day. The live music adds a special touch. We appreciate talent being showcased while enjoying a glass of wine. Our waitress had great recommendations. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"good ambiance, iffy wine (the house was better than the listed wines) and the cheese was not appropriate as spreadable and quite frankly the bread was bad. stay for 1 drink and move on."}
{"text":"I have heard about Andy's for awhile now, and finally got a chance to check it out on Friday night. It's right inside the Fairmont Hotel's lobby downtown, but the Fairmont is not your typical hotel. The lobby is beautiful with a large staircase that leads up to the second floor. There's seating under the staircase, as well as, within the bar area of Andy's. Every weekend they have live jazz right in the lobby area next to Andy's. On Friday night we sat in the bar area, and I ordered off the bar menu. I had their Asian Greens and Napa Cabbage salad. It was awesome! I was a huge fan of the whole experience. The jazz singer was a music teacher at one of the local colleges and some of her students were there supporting her. They started singing a French jazz song; the whole crowd stopped what they were doing and just watched and listened. It was a great, laid back atmosphere to end a Friday night in the city. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for something different to do!"}
{"text":"Jazz bar in downtown! Live music from THU-SAT. They also show the lists of musicians online so please check it out if you are also into music. Two sections  -one is bar, one is for music. For music listeners, the seating may not be the most comfortable and the most visible. Sometimes people share seats too. But since it's hotel lobby, I guess it is the best they can do..? Drinks were good, but service needs improvement!"}
{"text":"Andys (notice no apostrophe) is named for the two famous Andys of Pittsburgh: artist Andy Warhol and businessman Andrew Carnegie. Their coasters include quotes from each figure and decorations pay tribute to Warhol's artwork.

This place has a fantastic cocktail menu. We recommend the Smashed Apple and Cucumber Mint Mojito. I doubt that there are any drinks that aren't good on the menu.

They have 5 beers on tap and a decent selection of bottles. For beer drinkers, be sure to check in on foursquare for a free beer each day as a special.

Our bartender Bianca was fantastic and served us several times during our stay at Fairmont.

They have live jazz music on Friday and Saturday.

This place is upscale and has a lot of class, a must visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This is one of those bars that makes me think, \"You know, Pittsburgh isn't some two-bit town with nothing to do and bland food and drinks.\" It is swanky up in here, and I like it!

Andy's is so named after Mr Warhol, and the theme carries through the decorations and drinks. The bar is located in the lobby of the lovely Fairmont hotel, which is sleek and modern, without being cold. We stopped in here on NYE to grab a drink before heading off to another place to have additional drinks, and were quite delighted by the live jazz and thoughtful cocktails. I had a Bellini Manhattan and the hubby had a maple syrup infused Old Fashion. The Bellini Manhattan was delish-- loved it. The Old Fashion was good-- strong, and you could taste the maple syrup on the back end. Neil said he liked trying it once, but would want a traditional Old Fashion to drink all night. Service was attentive, and we got to valet park for NYE for $15 when there were zero spots available downtown. All in all, a success!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot. I am continually reminded of how rude and unprofessional the bartenders are here, though. This last time he was just short, very non friendly. The time before I was sitting at the bar with a friend. A group of people staying in the hotel approached the bar and spoke to us for a few minutes then went a found places to sit on the other side of the bar, there were about 8 people. The bartenders(4) all playing on their phones finally got their order then made fun of the group in front of our row of customers. They weren't sly about it. Where do they find these guys. The female tenders are usually great...wtf? Who hires these people. I have Been  to this bar over 10 times, I have seen unprofessional and discourteous interactions with customers at least 6 times. It's unfortunate because it is such a great space."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour or lack there of on Friday night. They advertise their happy hour as being from 5 pm to 7 pm, but its a joke. They had $2 Yuengling and that was the extent of their happy hour. 

We ended up ordering two glasses of a random red wine after being told that they were out of the actual wine we wanted. The server informed us that they were re-organizing their wine list so they were out of a bunch of stuff. Weird, or at least its weird for a wine bar located in the Fairmont!

For food we ordered the chips with three dips. The chips were store bought generic tortilla chips. The three dips consisted of Pace Picante Salsa, store bought hummus and Costco guacamole. Terrible!

To top it all off our server forgot to bring our check when we asked for it. When we asked again she apologized for forgetting and we walked up to the bar to pay. 

Overall, the service is slow, the food is a joke and the booze (if its in stock) is overpriced. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My friend knew someone who was performing at Andys so we stopped in last week. I have walked past the Fairmont a bunch of times but never put together the live music with a hotel lobby. The group was great, but the acoustics were pretty bad since the hotel lobby was not designed for live music.

The bartenders were great.  I had a Peach Berry Gimlet ($10) to start that was good and followed it with a whiskey sour, which was really good. My friend and I also ordered the Charcuterie ($17) to split.  The plate was a bit smaller than I expected but good. The plate was a bit boring and didn't match the description so I wouldn't recommend it. I would stick to drinking here.

The atmosphere is casual but chic.  The bar area is casual but cute, and they have giant blue chairs to sit in as well.  There are definitely a handful of regulars but the majority of people were either young professionals or retirees.  Not much in between.

Overall, this isn't a \"cheap\" night out, but the live music and great bartenders make for a fun night."}
{"text":"Love Andys. Great staff behind the bar, Ethan and James rock! Great wine list as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous. We sat down and got drinks immediately. They didn't have brandy and then couldn't make daiquiris. So bummed. We sat and talked for about 25 min. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. Finally the waiter came back and we asked for the check. Then he was MIA for another 25 min. 

We went up to the  bar and asked if we could pay there, and they said no!! He came hurrying over and grabbed my card and then..no joke.. disappeared again!! We found the manager and complained to him and then the waiter came hurrying out from behind the back again. 

I am in shock. This place has awesome atmosphere and delicious drinks. Hate go give it such a bad review but it truly ruined my night. At least there was good jazz music!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's bright and cosmopolitan. It feels like an oasis in the middle of downtown.

The best part by far, though, is the music. In particular, they have someone named Dane Vannatter sing there every so often, and he kicks ass. He sings all types of songs, but I remember his rendition of Al Green's \"Let's Stay Together\" in particular. He's amazing and is alone worth the trip to Andy's."}
{"text":"Just finished lunch here which I guess is a new menu. Pierogies were cold and the chicken on my friend's salad was partially raw inside. The staff was really nice, but we are currently waiting for the check and trying to decide where else  to eat to compensate."}
{"text":"I love Fairmont hotels!  Therefore, I thought I would love this lobby bar.  It had everything going for it, great location, it's a bar and they had jazz music.  Sadly I was disappointed.  The music is away from the bar and facing the opposite direction so the sound wasn't great.  A Moscow mule served in a tall glass isn't the right way to serve one......a copper mug is a must!   The amaretto was a small pour, and the prices were high.   The cool chairs in the lower area look nice and relaxing, but the tables and chairs in the bar area aren't all that comfortable.   

We only stayed for one drink as we weren't enjoying ourselves.  Bummed!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend received a $100 giftcard for the fairmont and,being a fan of jazz, he wanted to check out Andy's. The $100 giftcard covered all but about $10 of our bill and considering we did not order entrees,desserts-only wine and a couple apps-this is rather pricey, in my opinion. We ordered a 5 cheese plate for $20 which went excellent with our wine! We each had 3 glasses of wine-he might have had 4-but I know mine were priced at $12/glass and his was around the same price. The performer that evening was amazing and the atmosphere is so nice! Great place to listen to jazz,have a glass of wine, and enjoy good conversation."}
{"text":"I like to have a nightcap here when I'm staying at the Fairmont. Drinks are proper for the most part, the food is decent, and the people-watching is always entertaining. Prices are appropriate to the hotel it's situated in; this is not the Days Inn, folks. Generally a good place to unwind if you have a few bucks to drop."}
{"text":"This is less a bar than a hotel lobby.  It lacks a cool vibe or any real feel at all.  I did enjoy listening to some nice music but beware the cocktail menu without the prices on the tables.  I ordered a drink and it was $20!  They didn't even garnish it as stated in the menu.  They forgot my wife's garnish as well.  The drink was ok.  It should have been unbelievable for $20.  Just skip it."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here after dinner on 3/30/13 for a relaxing evening of jazz and drinks.  We were celebrating our third wedding anniversary and had a blast!  The drinks were good and the band was even better.  Service was a little slow but they were really busy on a Saturday evening.  I hope to return the next time we are in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Located in the lobby of the Fairmont Hotel, the bar area is brightly lit and the acoustics are poor. A bad combination for a jazz bar. The band is positioned at the base of the raised bar, facing away from the bar (another less than optimal facet). 

The music was decent and the service was average. I ordered a Moscow Mule, which was presented in a tall glass, not a copper mug! I'm sorry, but it is not a Moscow Mule if it is not served in a copper mug. 

Overall, it was a disappointment. Especially considering the bar is located in a Fairmont Hotel."}
{"text":"I basically only come here to listen to my friend Bronwyn song some great jazz tunes. I've gotten a couple beers or wine and have not had a problem with the service so far. The couches are very comfortable and it's a good place to meet new people."}
{"text":"I LOVED Andy's. Made it special-er for me that we unexpectedly found the place on an evening stroll through downtown Pittsburgh. Located at the rear of the Fairmont Hotel lobby, you walk in, and immediately realize you'll be feeling jazzy by evening's close. 

The drinks menu is inventive (i recall seeing fun vodka concoctions using fresh fruit, herbs, and things I can't pronounce or even try and spell). I opted for a white russian as a night-cap after my dinner around the corner at Meat & Potatoes (also amazing).
It also rocked that the pianist looked like Larry David and was jamming with his group, who filled the atmosphere with mellow, cool, and funky tunes.

Check out the sick flat screen on the wall across from the bar-- So no, sports fans, you won't miss the game if you're companion feels like gettin jazzy for an evening :)"}
{"text":"Having stopped in a couple of times, I have found Andy's to be a fun place for a glass of wine.  Have never had any of the food or a mixed drink.  Usually sat at the bar and the bartenders have been very friendly and gave good service.  One of the things that I would like to do is stop in when there is some jazz.  Have never been there when the music is playing.  I find that was easy to get to know others, just seems to be a place that you can talk with the others near you if you want to.  Also met a couple of townies (a couple of couples that live downtown), that stop in once in a while for some wine and to meet friends.  
As a few others have said, it really is next to the lobby of the hotel and has a somewhat cold chic decor.  The wine selection is OK but again, a little on the expensive side for the wines you get.
Plan on stopping back during the days/hours when the jazz is playing."}
{"text":"Um, no.. I went here with a date for what was probably going to be a romantic evening. However , the band that night was El Gato Libre.. They were disgustingly off key and played Pink Floyd and various other unrecognizable cover songs. No one in the band could carry a tune , however they seemed to think they were amazing . 
  We ordered a cheese plate and my date complained that there weren't any grapes with it ..Not a huge deal to me .I found the Moscato to be tasty and the service was acceptable however not exceptional. 
 All in all, I'm thankful we were able to laugh at the situation and poke fun. And being with the most handsome guy ever sure helped but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate upstairs at Habitat and wanted to continue our evening. We ventured into Andy's and saddled up to the bar. We were immediately greeted by the friendly bartender and I ordered Andy's crush. I absolutely loved it. It reminded of the orange crush I drink on vacation in ocean city. Their was a jazz band playing in the bar and the atmosphere was phenomenal."}
{"text":"so i was only waiting around at andy's for a friend to get off work, but i had a pretty good experience while i was there. i had 2 drinks off the specials list and enjoyed both. i also had the naan with 3 dipping sauces which was absolutely delish.
the service was good... they were friendly and attentive.
that's really about all i can say, since i was only there long enough for my friend to finish up. but i'd definitely go back for a few cocktails and a snack!"}
{"text":"Nice place for jazz.  Loved Maureen Budway last night!"}
{"text":"saturday was my birthday. we decided a trip to andys was in order to celebrate! at the end of the evening however, we left a little disappointed. :( it wasn't all that we had remembered it being. 
it was valentine's weekend, so you would think they would have been better prepared. the place was packed. as soon as a chair emptied, it was filled. later in the evening, they actually had to put up more chairs & tables to accomodate all the people. but, once again, only 2 servers. later, they did have another gal come & help, but it still wasn't enough. we've had the same waiter everytime we've been there, & he worked his litttle behind off! he apologized each time he came over to check on us. he worked very hard to keep us & the others happy!
the crowd was great! apparently, word has gotten out about this place! there was a nice assortment of every age, from 20's to 70-80's. dress was just as versatile. one woman had a gown on, while others were in jeans & tennies, & then everything in between.
while the group came with their own \"fan club\", they weren't quite as good as the others we've seen there. my husband said the singer wagged her finger too much while she sang, every song she sang was in spanish, and, she went to the \"school of elaine benice dancing\".
the food was the biggest disappointment. last time, i couldn't stop raving about it. this time, i can only complain. we got the same-the chatcuterie platter & a cheese plate. we got 2 pieces of mortatella, 2 of proscuitto, 2 of a salami, 6 olives & a smattering of almonds with honey mustard. last time we were there in august, and for the same price, we got 4 of each meat, olives in a small bowl, plus 2 killer pates, and a delicious cherry sauce. what happened???? the cheese plate was as pitiful. we got the 5 cheese selection. there were 6 kinds, 3 were blue, and none were that to-die-for cheddar. what kind of selection is that???? there were 2 strawberries and another toss of almonds with a bowl of honey to round out the depressing plate. still hungry, we got an order of loaded fries and the basket of cookies. the fries were good, how can you mess them up? the cookies, again the same price as last time, went from a dozen to 9. do they really think people won't notice?  
we can only hope that this night was a terrible fluke."}
{"text":"I come to this place often for the live jazz, cocktails, wine, and atmosphere. This is also a great place to people watch, inside and outside, since you can see everyone walking along Fifth Ave. 

I went in last week and sampled the new food menu, which was the first change in two years. It includes small plates, wings, sandwiches, and more. The prices are reasonable. I tried the roasted beets with honey and goat cheese. It was ok. The portion is too much for one person. There's only so many bites of this combination you can have until you're over it. I also tried the salmon with celery root risotto. The salmon was a little overcooked, which made it dry and chewy. The celery root risotto was bland. There was also an herb oil, and it was bland as well.

You must try the Green Park cocktail, cheese plate, and the espresso ice cream, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I finally decided to spurge before theater and try out one of the wines at Andy's. When I arrived the place was packed with people and I was listening to a DJ playing jazz music nearby. Since there was no seating at the bar area I asked one of the waitresses where I should go. She told me to have a seat anywhere and they would find me.

I settled into a high back chair that had a nice view of the outside passersby. She came over to me and I asked to try one of their sweet wines. She recommended their Italian moscata for me so I chose that. I got it fairly quickly and sipped it slowly to enjoy its full flavor.It was indeed a very good wine! My glass came to $14.00 but this is the Fairmont hotel so naturally I expected to pay more.

The places as I had said was very noisy and it was a great place to kill some time before the show. I couldn't enter from the side of the bar so I had to use the main entrance. As you come in there is a welcome fireplace. I learned that this bar is named for Andy Warhol as it was noted on my coaster.  I wasn't hungry so I didn't order any light bites. i will return when the occasion warrants it."}
{"text":"One word-AMAZING. The music is exceptional. Hands down one of my favorites in the city."}
{"text":"There is nothing special about this place except for convenience if you are staying at the Fairmont. The drinks are standard, food is about the same, if not below.

Positives- interesting cocktail list, and decent service if you don't sit at the bar (the blond waitress is lovely and great).

The negatives- all of the food is overpriced and not so hot. My friends and I used to put down a lot of money here until we realized we realized we were better off at a places in market square like revel and roost and Poros."}
{"text":"I love coming here for cocktails, light bites and live jazz. Most especially when Tania Grubbs is performing.
Prices are what you would expect them to be as Andy's is inside Fairmont Hotel. Service however can be a little lacking. Sometimes it's over the top fantastic and others it's flat out disappointing. Been here several times and will come again if they're hosting a performer I'm interested in seeing."}
{"text":"Great hotel bar - unexpected find in steel city!"}
{"text":"My fiance come here often. It's the place that 3 years ago I started to fall in love with him,  so the place is special to us. 
We love the casual atmosphere,  comfy seating, Eddie the dog, the loaded fries platter, etc.
The drinks are great.  My favorite is the cucumber mojito,  which isn't crazy priced like their other beverages. 
Last time we went,  we ordered some new drinks to try out something different. ....MISTAKE. The drinks were tasty BUT we had zero idea that our drinks were about $20 a piece...wow... neither were blow you off your feet epic to warrant that pricing..period.
We'll still come back but we'll be less likely to try new drinks as we do not want a billion dollar beverage bill at the end for having a couple drinks.  Lol"}
{"text":"I have never been here for drinks, only for the food.  Specifically, I come on Friday's for the bbq they offer outside.  It's not the most incredible bbq brisket I've ever had, but it hits the spot and isn't bad for something different from the usual market square lunch scene.  They do you give you a LOT of brisket, which is always nice.  One recommendation I have is to provide some sort of sauce - a vinegar-based bbq sauce would take this to four stars for me."}
