{"text":"Nice atmosphere and the restaurant always smells wonderful.  We love the coal fired pizza, the spicy pepperoni, and the fresh mushrooms on the pie.
Our waiter was very pleasant and attentive, both the food & the service were \"spot on!
Check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The pizza here is excellent, the menu said it will have a touch of smokey flavor but we did not notice that, which was fine.  We also got the Italian style wings, they were good, a 3.5 out of 5 as far as wings go.  The main draw is the pizza for sure.  I would lean towards a 4 on the overall food but the service was what pushed it up for me.  The place is new and the server seemed to be running the bar as well.  He was a little green but extremely friendly and attentive.  He made us a full serving of the new signature cocktail he was working on and gave it to us for free.  It was a very enjoyable experience, you always hope new places can keep up their momentum and i really hope this place can as well."}
{"text":"My companion and I had lunch here today.  It was very good. We started with a couple of salads.  I had the house salad with romaine, tomatoes, Garbanzo beans, hard boiled eggs,  and Kalama ta olives. I ordered the 1/2 portion which was still pretty large.  The salad was nice and the olives were delicious. My companion had the side salad with a balsamic vinaigrette.  It was a pretty standard salad,  but she really liked the dressing.  We had a medium Capo pizza. The toppings were roasted mushrooms and onions,  sausage, pepperoni, mozzarella and red sauce. The crust was super thin and the coal fire oven gives it a yummy char. Other reviewers complained that their pizza was burned, but ours was perfect and so good. The pizza cooks so fast that I wonder why they didn't just send it back. 

The atmosphere is very nice and they have a good beer and wine selection for a pizza place. Our server was nice and attentive.  All in all a very pleasant experience.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tony Saccos is always the best place to eat. You can never go wrong. The Coney Island beer is awesome. It's always a favorite. The Napoli pizza is probably one of the best pies going!!!!!"}
{"text":"We sat for 20 minutes no one took our order they got little girls serving they can't handle there job load I suggest they get better services with experienced customer service. Me and my girl just left we ain't got time for that fuck shit!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I have had in a long time.  Great dough fresh ingredients and crispy crust.  You could tell that everything is made fresh.  The staff was great very friendly and attentive.  The restaurant was nice not too noisy.  Wish there was one on the west side, preferably near strings vile or Middleburg heights.  Looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Not impressed had the calzone and it was burnt to a crisp on outside all fillings cold on inside. Just go to food court you will have better food lol"}
{"text":"Didn't really like the pizza. And for the abundance of employees bustling around we had to wait quite a while to get acknowledged. Our waitress was very good though. It's in a mall but has an outside entrance. But definitely still feels like being in the mall. And LOTS of screaming kids."}
{"text":"One star for decent service. It's not the server's fault that they have to serve inferior food.

This place is the perfect example of a great concept ruined by poor execution. We tried the Marco Polo specialty pizza. (Tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil, sun dried tomatoes, oven roasted chicken, artichoke hearts) analysis follows:

Crust - boring, bland
Sauce - like raw pur√©ed tomatoes. This overwhelmed all other potential flavors in the dish.
Mozzarella - I could see it but I couldn't taste it.
Basil - not enough
Sun dried tomatoes - tastes sour, like they weren't fresh when dried. 
Chicken - couldn't taste it at all
Artichokes - raw, usually when artichokes are served on pizza or with pasta, they're roasted beforehand. These were NOT."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza! Super fast service and the cannoli chips were awesome!!  First time there and will be going back."}
{"text":"After scouring the map inside Concord Mills Mall my friend and I decided to eat at this waste of time and money today while shopping a few hours away.  We entered the 'restaurant' and were greeted by a very bubbly blond young woman.  We were immediately asked if we would mind sitting at the bar.  I suppose she assumed because we had no packages that we wouldn't mind.  We vetoed the bar and asked to sit at a table.  We were promptly seated at the very back of the restaurant next to a table where they had tossed their silverware tray where they were wrapping the cutlery and a stack of pizza boxes waiting to be folded.

When our waitress approached we were still studying the options of what to eat and we gave her our drink order.  Nothing out of the ordinary, a soda and a glass of water.  These were delivered back to us quickly...hence the one star (our waitress is the only reason I stayed in the place).  When we asked a few questions about some of the dishes (we were deciding between a burger, a sandwich or a pizzette) we were told that the signature golden potato wedges were not available and would not be ready for 45 minutes if we wanted to wait on them.  Uhhhh no!   So we decided on the 'Famous Four Burger' which according to the menu is made up of tri-tip, brisket, ball-tip and short rib meat ground fresh.  According to the description of this burger I was looking forward to flavor central for my taste buds. Along with this unbelievable wonder of a burger we asked for the hummus with crostini squares.  I wanted my dining companion to try hummus as she had never tasted it before and I knew that she would enjoy the crostini.  After about 15 or 20 minutes our empty plates arrived and our waitress announced \"It will be just one more minute ladies.\"  More like 5 but okay.  Time to bite into this great burger.  First bite, no flavor.  I couldn't even taste that there was meat in my hamburger! Okay I gave it another chance because I was really hungry.  Nope, not worth the $11.  Well, after that we wanted to go ahead and try the hummus only to discover that the crostini had not been delivered to our table.  After reminding our waitress twice and asking the waitress who checked on us about our crostini we were told, \"oh, it's in the oven.\"  We wound up waiting for the crostini for 15 minutes and when we got it it was over-oiled, greasy, bland and several pieces were burnt.  I thought the meal could not get any worse...oh how wrong I was.  The hummus, which was described as a blend of garlic, tahini and olive oil, was flavorless mush.

I would definitely say that this trip to Tony Sacco's was an hour and half I will never get back and I hope that any person that reads this does not waste their time on this really bad restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick beer and a bite.  The beer was good.   I ordered a small appetizer with hummus and crostini.  You would think that a pizza place would be able to serve fresh crostini/dough, but it was so chewy and hard that it had to be from yesterday.  Th presentation and amount of hummus was good, but at least put some fresh bread with it. It is what you do....  On the other hand, the prices were very good."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere good pizza love the thin crust coal oven give the pizza excellent flavor. Salads are also very good usually get the small anti-Pasto, only complaint a little pricey for pizza but I guess you get what you pay for we we've been back several times and will continue to do so ,nice place."}
{"text":"I gave this three stars not because of the food but because the server we had (CHRISTOPHER) or Cy as he was called was absolutely horrible!  Did not make eye contact and when he spoke he would turn away like he was looking or talking to someone else.  He seemed very distracted.  He was like this with several other tables.  Ordered our appetizer and the main meal came out before the app. We had to get another server and let her know to cancel the app. \"Cy\" never  came over to appologize.  When he finally did come over he gave us 2 coupons for free appetizers and we could barely hear him.  The food itself was very good."}
{"text":"This is a review for the Mentor , OH location. Anyone who thinks this is good thin-crust pizza obviously has no idea what they are talking about. The slices are entirely limp when you pick them up. They are not crispy at all like they should be. I would put this pizza on the level of elementary school cafeteria pizza. I also ordered the garlic rolls, which were supposed to come with a dipping sauce. The rolls came in a bowl with the dipping sauce poured into the bowl, which I though was strange. Who wants their bread getting soggy in a puddle of oil? This also makes for a mess when you are trying to pack the leftover rolls to go. The rolls were good (but a little undercooked -they were cold in the centers). The sauce that came with the rolls was excellent and loaded with garlic. I also got a side of marinara for dipping the rolls in and the marinara was excellent. The menu had only one dessert option listed, and it had no chocolate in it. I'm not saying everyone likes chocolate, but many of use do and it was a bummer that there was no selection  of desserts.  I thought it was pretty nasty that NONE of the people handling our food (you can watch them make your pizza) were wearing gloves.  Our waitress seemed to be off in space. We were there during an off hour and she took our appetizer order and then just stood in the distance looking at the ceiling. I am not sure if she thought were weren't going to order a main meal or what, but it was strange. We had to tell her we wanted to order a meal after the appetizers came out. For a pizza place, the best thing on the menu should have been the pizza, and it did not even come close. Therefore, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The pizza is very good. I've had several of the specialty pizzas and thought they all had excellent flavor. For lunch I often order the club sandwich and meatball sandwich. Although the sandwiches have changed they are still very delicious. I prefer the old preparation better but there is nothing I can do about it. Seems like the good stuff that is always perfect gets changed most often. Why mess with something that is already perfect and unique?! Excellent restaurant, always good service."}
{"text":"I love Tony Sacco's! Coal oven pizza is my weakness and they hit it out of the park every time. Their garlic knots (rotolis I believe they're called) are delicious. Nothing is better than dipping delicious bread in oil and seasonings. They're pizza is the star though. I never take home leftovers because I'd rather stuff my face with every last piece.

I highly recommend Tony Sacco's!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever and found a hair in our pizza. Disgusting. Would never go back. Food was brought out at different times and took almost an hour. Manager was useless as well."}
{"text":"This is a nice place  my wife's favorite pizza .don't let the fact that there in a mall stop you from going once inside it doesn't feel like a mall place. The burgers are also good"}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza. Laura n I love coming here.  You can't go wrong building your own or getting one of their  specialties.  Plus I can get a beer at the mall!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza. We have gone there a few times already. The last time though the pizza was soggy and really greasy. I hope that was just an off night as the previous times the crust was just fantastic. 

The antipasti salad is fantastic as well. A great addition to the GLM mall."}
{"text":"Unbelievable experience. Everything from the service, to the beer, and of course the food was absolutely outstanding. The meatball lollipops, the wings and the pizzas were my personal favorite. Will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"First time here at Tony Sacco's and they did not disappoint! We ordered a meatball, chicken and mushroom pizza with the garlic and onion wings! Both were very very yummy!!! Service was just awesome!! Loves the experience here!!! Would definitely fine with them again!"}
{"text":"The third star is for the location. It's nice to have a pizza place in the mall (though it's not close to me). Tony Sacco's specializes in pizza pies that cooked in a coal oven. I was expecting some char on the crust and some coal flavor. It wasn't much better than Brixx Wood Fired Oven. Pretty sad. The service was okay. I ate in the early evening with some friends, well before closing and at the end of our meal our waitor proceeded to clean our table and take our water while we were still sitting and chatting. I wanted another sip :( It's nice and clean on the inside and there's a nice large bar area. The pizza is really lacking in my opinion. Pump up the coal Tony Sacco's!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now, and each time was better then the last. They have half price pizzas on Thursdays, so I figured it would be a great opportunity to try a couple of the specialty pizzas I'd been wanting to try. We tried the buffalo chicken pizza and the Greek pizza. The buffalo chicken pizza was my favorite, (to be fair I don't like olives, which are on the Greek pizza, but wanted to try it anyway). They also give you a side of blue cheese for the buff chick pizza, and I don't know if it's homemade, but it was amazing.

They also have amazing lunch specials. I think the one is like $7 and you get a salad and personal size pizza. I've also had the basil mojito. It was really good, but inconsistent in alcohol content depending on who is bartending. 

This place is great! The crust is thin and crunchy since it's cooked in a coal oven, and I'm a sucker for bubbles or char on the crust!!"}
{"text":"I had visited this in Michigan the week before and wanted my husband to try it.  Our margherita pizza was actually better here than it had been in Michigan, where it tasted like they had coated the crust in oil.

I don't think they use Italian 00 flour but the pizza is good.  We also tried the hummus and that was very good.

I'm so excited this is in Ohio and I hope we can make it back!  I LOVE coal oven pizza!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza for the mall. If you are familiar with any kind of NY style pizza don't expect that here.  They use a lot of cheese but it is flavorful. Garlic knots are good as well.  Like I said overall good just not amazing."}
{"text":"A friend and I came here by recommendation. We each bought a pizza planning to take home leftovers and both ended up finishing them! The coal oven gives the pizza a great flavor. 

The menu offers a nice selection of toppings, the staff is really helpful and they offer numerous coupons."}
{"text":"Do not eat here!! Our waitress was fantastic but the restaurant was out of food...the servers were not interested or educated on the contents of their food to prevent allergic reactions. Wildly disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Absolute best pizza around!  Finally NY Pie in Ohio!  Ingredients are fresh and crust exceptional.  Go as many times as you can!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I are already planning on when we can go back.  I ordered a small pizza, and the very helpful/friendly waitress asked if I wanted the personal pizza (which I didn't see on the menu) so since I wasn't too hungry I went with that, and even took some home!

I LOVE a good thin crust, and this had a great flavor as well.  Their happy hour has half price appetizers, we had the garlic knots and it was yummy. 

I got peperoni, roma tomatoes, and kalamata olives on mine, and it was delicious.  They have romano (I believe) at the table and red pepper flakes, as well as garlic powder.  

Lots of seating, and TVs, which is also a nice bonus.  But we're going back just because the pizza was that good."}
{"text":"First time here and I was surprised by how good it was I always thought it was bigger and more expensive... went for the first time and the pizza was amazing! Fresh mozzarella was absolutely amazing my husband had the Italian sub he liked it but the bottom bun was a little hard we had the garlic knots well there version of them so good and very reasonable prices! Went during happy hour so appetizer was half off but we'll definitely be back 
Server was a little slow though when no one was there she had only 1 other table"}
{"text":"Today marked my first visit and I have to say I am impressed. Firstly our server Karissa was very fast, friendly, and prompt. The place was clean. The food was excellent. I ordered a Bianco Pizza which had 4 kinds of cheese. Top notch experience all the way around."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the Napoli pizza!  We added mushrooms to ours and the taste was amazing!  Trying the Barbecue Chicken pizza next time we go.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Hot, tasty, crunspy (crunchy but crispy) pizza love here!  Fast enough for two toddlers to stay calm and so good that we had to order a second one.  That is also nice as it's wholesome but not overly bready/filling! 

Toppings are delicious cheese blend is fabulously tasty and the server Chris was super nice!  I can say our kids aren't super picky but they have good taste they can be choosy."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza. Enough said. I can't speak about any of their other food, but tge pizza was very unsatisfactory."}
{"text":"Went here last Sunday about 2:30...they weren't busy. Maybe 3 or 4 tables. As soon as we ordered drinks, i checked the yelp reviews and got a little scared. Luckily our experience seemed to go a lot better than some others who have done reviews.  Our waiter did everything right and was nice. They have 1/2 price apps on Sunday so we tried the garlic knots. We also got a pizza with grilled chicken...the food was good. Im not a huge fan of pizza but I enjoyed the experience and would probably go again. I was probably most excited about the bill...2 people ate plenty of food and got sodas for $16."}
{"text":"We went in the other day to meet my brother  in law and sister with there baby. We made reservations and the table was ready upon arriving which is key when you have kids with you. They say is promptly and we ordered the traditional margarita pizza and had salads. The pizza was delicious. It was cooked perfectly. It is inside the mentor mall which is a bummer, but the restaurant is really nice. 
The service was great and she was always quick with whatever we ordered. 
On a side note we attended two birthday parties there where they did an excellent create your own pizza party. The kids absolutely loved it. 
The location is the only reason it's not getting five stars. Mentor mall isn't a great place to shop."}
{"text":"Pizzas are awesome, salads are huge. You have to try the strawberry shortcake."}
{"text":"We stopped in here after doing some Christmas shopping and boy oh boy they did not disappoint! I probably should have stopped after my half Caesar salads so I ended up getting a pizza with pepperoni sausage and I love the sausage is crumbled sausage not hot dog sausage which in my opinion makes the pizza thousand times better. The kids got a half pepperoni half cheese pizza and we had a couple of beers. The server was super prompt and the pizza I don't know what it is about coal-oven Pizza, but it takes a pretty fairly steady hand to cook it and cook it right. Because coal oven pizzas cook at such a high temperature, even a couple seconds too long the pizza starts to dry out rapidly. Then again on the other side too short and it is way too raw. But Tony Sacco's most definitely has this formula figured out and figured out right. Thanks again for another great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Great crust similar to how it's made in Naples, Italy-the city that invented pizza! We had the pizza with mozzarella and ricotta cheese and crumbled meatballs. My 86 year old Italian friends from Brooklyn, NY say you should be able to fold your pizza when you eat it.  Perfect fold here!"}
{"text":"Can't understand the good reviews on here about this place.  Coal oven pizza doesn't make a cardboard crust taste any better than a regular oven.  We were thoroughly disappointed with this pizza.  Like trying to chew leather.  The wings didn't fare much better.  They were tough touted  as being coal oven baked, but were just as slimy as gas station wings.  Total waste of 40 bucks here.  Place looks nice, people are nice, but I'll be surprised if they're here a year from now.  Of course, who knows?  Some folks think Taco Bell is good Mexican food too."}
{"text":"Passing thro' and got directed to Tony Sacco's Coal Oven Pizza. From awesome customer service (they even have their own Ben Affleck look alike!) to the great tasting pizza .....was some of the best EVER! Try the Cano or Aloha pizzas for wonderful tasting pies. And tell  Mike hi from Texas!!"}
{"text":"You had me at $2.50 Happy Hour wine. 

But the delicious, hand-tossed, coal oven pizzas don't hurt one bit. This is a great \"comprise\" spot when we pick up our hungry 9 year old from school. He goes to school out in Mentor--we live in Cleveland, it's a long drive to be a hungry boy! Tony Sacco's has pizza, which is always a win for kids, but it's adult pizza and food--no Chuck-e-Cheese stuff here. 

I read a few of the reviews and I must confirm that yes, they do use fresh mozzarella and now, it's not shredded now. Here are my thoughts: Happy hour dinner is the best time to go, because the cheap drinks for one, but for two--it's a great time to get discounted apps. We know the little guy loves bread, so the garlic knots (at like $2 or something) would be a hit. Hot, fresh from the oven, covered in garlic butter and sprinkled with parmesan--yum! But they should definitely be served with marinara. The side salads are quite substantial! I could have shared mine. Or if you want a big salad, try the antipasto. It's loaded with goodies. They do personal size pizzas for just under $6, which is a great deal and option. The little guy got cheese, I stood by my old pepperoni mushroom combo and my guy got a calzone. I really like their pies--mostly because I'm a thin 'n chewy crust type of gal. Everything tastes super-fresh. My only knock is that I think the sauce could use a little more punch (and salt), but sauce is a pretty personal preference. And how can you complain while eating a hot, gooey slice of pizza?"}
{"text":"Discovered this place as I was walking through Great Lakes Mall.  It was a wonderful surprise and a great alternative to the horrible choices in the food court.  The service is excellent and very friendly.  My husband and I shared a pizza on our first visit and the second visit we had personal pizzas with our own favorite toppings (anchovies, mushrooms for me) and pepperoni and sausage for my husband.  Excellent choices for both of us.  There are lots of traditional toppings.  The salads are huge if you aren't into pizza (are there such people?).  I've been a couple of additional times and we'll be back.  Now I have two places to go for great pizza."}
{"text":"Have been here many times, food had always been great except for today we ordered appetizers got one didn't get other until asked about it. Five minutes later got pizza crust was burnt. Waiter took second appetizer and pizza off the check."}
{"text":"We went here one Friday afternoon (around 4pm) so it was pretty dead. We got an appetizer and a pizza, and our waiter (who I assumed was also the manager) was more than helpful in reccomending things to us, and even brought us extra pita chips for our appetizer both when we ran out, and again when we wanted to take the rest of it to-go. No complaints, great service, and the food was very tasty!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza.  Coal fired ovens make a difference.  Thin crust and not the soggy stuff you get at most other places in the area. Good, fresh tasting sauce with fresh basil.  Nice environment and decent beer on tap.  Adding burgers to the menu, but didn't give those a try.  Stick to what they do best....Pizza Pie!

Service was more than attentive.  Enjoyed the trip and will return."}
{"text":"Great Place! Unlike all the other food court type restaurants at Concord Mills this is a REAL restaurant. They have a great outdoor patio and the inside is warm and inviting. There are lots of huge TV's and a great bar for all the husbands that would rather be watching the game instead of shopping with their wives. 

The food is awesome. You have to try the rotisserie style chicken wings. They are unlike any wings I've had and they're great. The pizza is honestly the best in town! Thin crust, fresh ingredients and a great sauce. I personally love roasted red peppers on a pizza but they're impossible to find...not here. All ingredients are fresh and not frozen. I'm pretty sure I heard the owner say they don't even have a freezer, that's impressive!

Next time you're at Concord Mills you have to drop in and have a drink, pizza or appetizers. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Ate here two years ago it was good. Came back to Charlotte with family. Every bad review about this place is true now. It should be called Tony Suckos! Hostesses had empty tables, told is there was a wait for a party of six. Sat three parties of three? Math is another challenge. NO Go! Left for Giacomos. If you have 12 minutes and want a better experience where you can be appreciated, Giacomo's!"}
{"text":"Called in an order at 12:52 pm and arrived at 1:34 pm to find that my pizza had not even been made! Sarah ( the front of house manager with Red hair) thought it was pretty funny. I disagree since I was on my lunch break and was told over the phone 15-20 mins. I drove 12 miles for the product but don't appreciate being laughed at by your so called manager. There were only 3 tables of customers in the whole place....can someone explain the holdup?
Tip for better business: Hire folks who give a shit about your business/product and you might just make some money! I'm livid behind the lack of customer service at this location. It's not the first time this has happened but it will be the last.
The finished product tastes good but the customer service left a bad taste in my mouth!"}
{"text":"Yelp event+amazing time= a very happy Yelper.

The appetizers here are amazing, I mean I couldn't put down the twisted bread knots and sausage bites.  The pizza was abundant and tasteful coming from a coal/log oven.  The staff was amazing and attentive to their guests.  But what a night.  They give great doggie bags and presentation is a huge thing for this restaurant.  You would never expect this type of establishment in the mall, but oh will I be back.  Its hidden by Dillards but its anything but shy.  The flavors are good and the toppings are large, which I love. My favorite had balsamic sauce on the pizza with portebello mushrooms and sausage.  

I would definitely come back to this establishment, for their pizza oven, good bites, great atmosphere and attentive staff.  This is a very relaxed place that you'll be able to satisfy your pizza and BREAD craving!!"}
{"text":"Called at 938. Placed my order and then was informer that Ian the manager already shut the oven off. I guess we will order pizza hut."}
{"text":"Surprisingly nice bar in the Great Lakes Mall! Sadly, not a very nice patio area. It's cramped and has a bad view. The bar itself has a huge selection of liquors and beers and a surprisingly nice selection of wine. The bar staff is very friendly and attentive. There is a social style table directly behind the bar that is also open seating. The staff in the dining room seemed to be less attentive and friendly but gave adequate service from my perspective. 

The menus, the restaurant itself and the bathrooms all appeared clean and well kept up. The atmosphere was casual and comfortable and slightly loud. The kitchen is open style and everything they make is cooked in a stone coal oven. Interesting concept...

We tried the wings, a pizza and a dessert and all were very good. The Ingredients were fresh and flavorful. I enjoyed the thin crust on the pizza. It had a nice chew and crisp to it. The toppings stayed put and didn't slide off when you lifted a slice. I hate when that happens! Ha! The wings were tasty but could have used a tad more skin crisp and the blue cheese dressing they came with was delicious and loaded with blue cheese. We finished with the berry cake with cream. Very refreshing and not overly sweet or heavy and just enough to share. 

We will be back, but I'd recommend the half priced pizza night as the prices were a tad high, but comparable to other specialty pizza restaurants."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and fabulous pizza. Don't miss the meatball lollipops! The staff were friendly and attentive ."}
{"text":"We came here after the movies and everyone's dinner was very good. I love their baked wings, the pizzas were delicious, and my calzone was excellent. 

The service was very quick and extremely friendly. We will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Caesar Salad with  Chicken and it was Okay but to much Romain and some of the Lettuce were Brown and that  was a Turn off for me and the Chicken was Dry. Had to Throw out most of the Lettuce but that is my first Bad Experience at Tony Sacco's. I will be back."}
{"text":"Tonight's adventure in dining was trip to the mall and a visit to Tony Saccos.  It took a while to find it as its off the beat and path tucked in next to Dillards. ( There is also an outside entrance )  The place is new looking and clean. I was amazed how busy it was for a new place on a Friday night @ 8 PM ?  Then it hit me, they serve alcohol !! people were sipping wine while having pizza and about 10 well mannered folks hanging out having a few drinks.  Another  thing that stood out is there is no shortage of servers and help, I counted at least 15+ easy.  

OK, now the food :)   

We started with the hummus chips all made in house fresh. I asked If I could get the chips without seasoning and the server quickly said \"no problem, I'll have them made for you\"   and they came out fast !  The chips are oven baked right there in front of you :)   

 For my dinner I selected the buffalo chicken wrap with sauce and ranch on the side, good thing I did, the buffalo sauce does have a bite !! (hot)   I dipped in each and in the hummus too from the chips.  The chicken was still hot from the oven and was a generous amount.  Not a bad wrap. 

My G/F ordered the vegi sandwich.  The sandwich was stuffed with vegi goodies and cheese on a toasted sub style bun. She made quick work of clearing her plate !! The bun was a bit crispy so if you like your subs softer, I would request lightly toasted. ( It is a charcoal fired oven so its not like your oven at home)

We had a coupon for 5 bucks off $25 and guess what, our order came to $24.50  a pleasant surprise but the computer system wouldn't let it slide so we ordered up another hummus and chips to go ($6 normally but 1/2 price after 9 pm so $3)   with that we came in around $22 and change with the coupon  plus tip ....all and all a decent low stress dinner. 

NOTE *   

I'm sure they're more known for pizza but  I had pizza twice this week so I just couldn't have it again but it appeared that 90+% of the people in there were having  pizza !!   These are stone cooked oven pizzas so they are not cookie cutter alike since they are hand tossed and moved around while cooking, but the ones that passed our table all looked awesome !"}
{"text":"Customer service was nice but the food was regular...generic. Even down to the marinara sauce. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Bad the first time I went a worst the second time. I ordered a personal sized pizza to go and went to pick it up and It was just sauce and dough with few pieces of thickly shredded mozzarella. I couldn't believe that someone would actually put a pizza in the oven looking like that.  The bar tenders were shocked and a cook who happened to witness me open the box brought it back and had another made."}
{"text":"First time I was here I was utterly surprised on how good the pizza was and how sick the beer selection is.  Visited with Big Red and my lil one on Sunday after an all night wedding bender.  The pizza hit the spot.  Thin and chewey.  Just how I like it.  Thick pizza is NOT pizza...its casserole, dammit.  Now, the staff was all really young and was standing around the pizza making area goofing around.  Not annoying at all just a tad much when there are only 3 tables in the place and its kinda quiet.  Its a nice change from the tight-ass servers in places now adays that act too cool and cant wait to take their tip money for an 8-ball and some Moscow Mules after work.  I didn't mind the kids playing one bit.  Now, our server on the other hand was out there.  Took my 2 of the 3 drink orders at the table and left, leaving Big Red holding the beer menu and not even told her what she wanted.  Um, ok..  All was good the rest of the meal until we got a takeaway box and our bill.  Looney Tunes comes back and takes my plate with food that I WAS EATING away.  Guess she's trying to tell me my tubby ass is done eating?  Also, I know they are trying to have a standout beer selection but this is Mentor.  Home of the Abercrombie, tanning, Bud Lt types.  Hell, Mentor Ave is one continuous strip mall from hell.  Zero originality.  The first 2 beers we tried were draft.  Both tasted like ass.  Either the beer was old, the lines are dirty, or a mixture of both (what Im thinkin').  Had 2 different bottles after.  Both tasted like they were old too.  Diacetyl is a real thing.  If your going to have 137 beers that no one (except for a select few) are going to drink then have  a special once and a while and get those older beers out of stock.  Take a small loss and people with start to know you have FRESH beer...not stank ass beer...

Oh and we didn't get balsamic on our Caprese salad because \"most people don't like it and you have to ask for it on the side\".  That's the quote verbatim I got from some kid working there.  Nothing like oily cheese and tomatoes.  Good thing that vinegar bite wasn't there to ruin my Mentor, homogenized palate...  Again, Mentor needs to step it up a little..."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried them for the first time tonight and we were very pleased.

She got a half-sized Caesar salad and I got a half-sized insalata di casa.  The Caesar was good, but not remarkable, but the house salad was excellent, all kinds of interesting stuff on it with a very good dressing.  The half-sized salads are plenty big for a side salad.

We split a 12\" pizza with mushrooms, roasted garlic and black olives.  The pizza is very good, nice crust, thin and on the crisp side and the toppings were all excellent.  Not as good as the New York style I grew up on, but among the better pizzas around here.  The 12\" was a good size for two people.  

I had a very nice glass of Chianti and my wife had water.  $33 without the tip, not bad.

We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table (Friday night at 8:30).  Service was attentive and friendly.  The place was very nice looking, even if it is attached to the mall.

I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"At best this place is average.  Not bad but not worth trying either, many other places are better in the area."}
{"text":"I proudly claim to be a foody. This place is top notch. Grew up eating New York style pizza and they do a wonderful job here. Is it the best pizza I've ever eaten? No, but for half off Thursdays it tastes incredible. Every month they also do a special pizza. My favorite was the Reuben pizza which was out of the box and tasty. Their garlic knots are also very good. We also ask for extra oil and parm cheese. The main downfall is they do not offer gluten free pizza crust so they limit their customer base in that regard."}
{"text":"Where are the owners?
The food is inconsistent. I wish the owners of this place would show up and be a part of making this place great. The pizza's come out charred on the bottom most of the time. I know this is a coal oven.. but cmon! No one wants a burned pizza."}
{"text":"Three stars because of the setting, the service, and decent pizza for delivery. We had pizza delivered to our home, and the pizza was good. Yesterday, we visited the restaurant for the first time. It has a decent layout with a full bar. A lot of tv screens for game viewing. 

Only two other tables were occupied at the time. I ordered buffalo style wings with ranch. The wings were good albeit really salty. After five, the saltiness was too much. Would be great with beer while watching a game. We also ordered a veggie sandwich with ricotta cheese. The sandwich was good but a little on the bland side. We ordered margaritas, which were horrible. The service was good but the food was below average in my opinion."}
{"text":"Good coal-fired pizza. Lots of cheese and the sauce isn't overpowering. Let's get to the real surprise though - the wings! They're coal-fired too (their menu states they have no fryers or microwaves) and have a great, smokey taste and a firm texture that isn't at all greasy. Don't miss this treat!"}
{"text":"This review is about nothing other than the food.  Service = 5 stars.  Management = 5 stars (there were a few fruit flies buzzing around and the manager personally apologized and said they are trying to fix it.. super professional).  Cleanliness = 5 stars.  The only reason I gave the 3 star rating is the food is just food.  Pizza can be done a million different ways that different people enjoy.  That being said... when you get a pizza... you'd expect the toppings to be 'kinda' fresh.  

  We got the Aloha pizza.  Crust was fine.  Sauce was sauce.  Cheese was cheese.  The ham was obviously out of a bag and obviously the ham used for salads.. the little squares.  The pineapple was out of a can.. mushy and bland.  I don't expect the world to stop when I order pizza but this was just normal bland pizza.  Probably gonna stick with Marcos like we usually do in the future."}
{"text":"Wanted to check this out because we go to the movies at Concord a lot. Ive noticed that it is never busy even at times that should be. Checked out the takeout menu, and it was a 1 page \"flier\" with only a few items. Reluctantly we ate here, and it was very disappointing.   My wife ordered the wings and they came out immediately.  It was obvious that they were cooked earlier and put in the microwave.  I ordered a pizza and it was overloaded with bad cheese.  Also, you could tell by the taste of the pizza that it was not fresh dough and frozen.  I dont think this place will last very long and hopefully Concord Mills can find a better restaurant to serve the needs of the mall goers esp the movie crowd which is right next to it.

**wrote this review 2.5 years ago and predicted they would go out of business. Now they are CLOSED with a new pizza place opening Sept 1st."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but made by people who can't be bothered to wear gloves, making pizza while touching their faces , coughing etc. Don't want their germs on my pizza and when it was brought to the manager's attention, he seemed unconcerned."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying our experience here is USUALLY very pleasant.  However, tonight was awful.  Got sat and server came in a timely fashion.  We put in our whole order at once cause we knew what we wanted.  Then the time starts ticking away.  Drinks we ordered didn't come.  Appetizer didn't come.   But lo and behold, here comes our pizza.   Um could we get our drinks and appetizer please?   Blames the forgetfulness on saying the bar couldn't find the grapefruit juice.  I mean.  Come on.   Reluctant to return."}
{"text":"Went to Tony Sacco's last night with friends and family.  Together we had a party of 11.  It was about 5pm when we walked in and the restaurant was almost completely empty save for about 3 tables.  They refused to seat is stating that parties of 10 or more require an advance reservation.  We advised that we would be happy to divide into into two tables and they said no. We were beyond shocked.  How does a restaurant refuse business?"}
{"text":"I came here to eat around 4pm. It was not busy, and was sat immediately. But after that I waited 20 mins for someone to come take my order. After waiting, many of the servers were standing doing nothing, the hostess sat a couple in an empty table behind me and a server immediately came to get them water and took their order. This was ridiculous, so I left, and will not be going back. Worst service I have ever had."}
{"text":"Our server, Erik was the absolute sweetest. Very attentive and polite. The kitchen apparently dropped one of our slices of pizza so they gave us the first one and made a second pizza for us on the house! The manager (tall woman with short hair) was so nice. Drinks are delicious too! I recommend the Mango Tango and the Lynchburg Lemonade."}
{"text":"One star just because of smell!!! Waited for service for 11 mins 51 seconds never seated or even acknowledged"}
{"text":"The pizza has a very distinct taste. When I'm seated close enough I enjoy watching the cooks pulling the pizzas in and out of the coal oven! Service is great, atmosphere is nice and the prices aren't bad. Come in on Thursdays during their half-price pizza time!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I've only been here once...

My brother in law & I decided to check this place out one night...we shared 2 medium pizza & a salad. I can't believe how much food we had leftover to take home with us. 

No joke, it felt a little yuppie in there. I almost had a heart attack when the Bill came..you would of thought we ordered top shelf drinks with our meal. 

Next time I want stone oven pizza I will gladly go to The Wild Goose in DTW!"}
{"text":"Below average pizza. The garlic knots as an appetizer were wet. They were literally dripping in garlic/parmesan/olive oil... And not in a good way. Ordered a simple Pepperoni Clasico and a supreme (with a forgettable name). The red sauce was much too sweet, the mozz was used very sparingly and the pepperoni seemed to be Hormel brand. The ingredients on the supreme were clearly frozen when added and not fresh. 

All in all, this was a mistake for lunch. Great service though."}
{"text":"This was a treat for us. We went in not expecting much on our way to catch a flick at the nearby AMC theater. They had all kinds of fresh, delicious and homemade pizzas. We went traditional for our first visit - just pepperoni. As simple as that sounds, it was great. Flavorful, fresh, fairly quick and was a nice quick treat. We will return."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the pizza ! Had a white pizza (forgot the name) but it was awesome ! It is my grandsons favorite pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  perfect, light crust with the right amount of burnt taste to it.  Coal/wood ovens are the only way to go!"}
{"text":"(In my horrible Italian voice) \"Mamma Mia itsa Pizza\", I have no idea why I started with that. Hey Tony, Cool joint at Concord Mills Mall. I can't say that I am a fan of the pizza though, and I may have found your issue. I think its the sauce. The sauce is quite bland. I can tell its just a base sauce but you need to add the herbs and spices to the sauce to bring out the flavor. I understand you add your seasoning to the finish product but if you kick up your sauce some more with a little flavor at the beginning you would have a winner. Today I had the small 12\" Napoli pizza and it was just OK! The tomato sauce just had no flavor to it to make me thoroughly enjoy it. BUT!!! There is a but, your crust is pretty freaking good, that may have been one of the reasons I kept indulging into more and more slices. Not to mention I was pretty hungry. The meatballs were cooked pretty well too, Great job with that. I'm glad you all didn't just dump a bunch of basil on my pie either and instead it was just the right amount. 
One Major plus about this place is the service, very quick and upbeat and its not like they don't want to be there. 
Overall I feel like you have some time to work out a few kinks and make a few adjustments since your just opening this new location. 
SIDENOTE: This entire review was written in my Black Italian voice!"}
{"text":"Place is nice. It's not an entrance to the mall, but people think it is. So, you constantly have people walking through all the tables to get to the mall. Also, when we got there, there were plenty of tables open, they told us it would be a 15minute wait. So, we stepped aside and waited. There was another group of people that came in, they were asked if they wanted to sit in the bar area, which they did and were led directly to a table, while we still waited. So, we finally get seated, order some beers and drinks, waitstaff was hit and miss. You could easily tell the difference between the managers and the servers. Pizza came out, hot and crispy, Toppings wouldn't stay on, I HATE THAT, take one bite and have a chin full of cheese. The BBQ pizza was just OK, I have had much better. The sauce tasted funny, maybe too tangy and it looked like it had pieces of package lunchmeat on top of it. We showed the manager our YELP discount we got for checking in there, she aknowleged but didn't put the discount on our bill, we had to flag her back down again to remind her of the discount. Also, I wanted to take some pictures of the pizza and the decor, but NO WIFI !"}
{"text":"On my list of Tonys, Tony Sacco's ranks somewhere between Tony Danza and Tony Blair.  That is to say good, but not great.

Stopped by on a Saturday night around 7:30 to pick up a pie to go.  One of the great things about coal-oven pizza, is that it cooks in no time.  From the time I placed my order with the bartender to the time he brought the box to me, no more than ten minutes had elapsed.

My pizza baseline is the margherita.  I ordered a small ($12.95 if I recall) pie and waited for my pie.  After it arrived, I took it home for further tasting. 

One of my culinary pet peeves is pizza joints whose pizza does not fit in the box that they attempt to stuff it into.  As you can see in the pic I posted, Two pieces of my pizza were bent in the boxing process.  Unfortunate, but not a deal-breaker.

As for the taste of the pie, it was good.  I thought the crust was pretty good.  It had a nice flavor and some nice charring on the top of the crust.  The sauce was okay.  It wasn't bad, but it also wasn't \"this tastes like they made it this morning\" good.  It was pretty neutral in all honesty.  Ths mozz was good and I appreciated the fact that they chiffonade their basil.

It's nice to have a coal-oven pizza joint a little closer than Grimaldi's.  I'll come back as I'd like to try their meatball pie, but I won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"For a last minute decision, my wife and I decided, okay it was my decision, to try this spot. Not really sure about a \"mall restaurant\" but every day you can learn something new! 

Once you enter (they have an outside the mall entrance) this doesn't feel like this is part of the mall. Spacious tables that are large, nice bar and a bar high table counter to eat sets this apart from the rest. Full service bar with a very impressive beer list, both draft and bottles. Wife also loved the wine list too.

As for the food... Come hungry!!! Salads are large enough for two, although we did not have one. Beware of the Garlic Rolls! Oh my were they good!! Try the half order, just right for two and still leaving room for a pizza. 

The pizza....WOW!! we split a large Napoli. Now I can take on any pizza but this time I met my match. Two HUGE pieces were enough to satisfy my taste buds and still have two-to-go home with. This pizza is highly recommended.  No room for desert tonight, but for sure another time.

Finally have to give a big shot out to the owner Mike. Took a nice time to welcome us, explained the newest pizzas, and personally entered the WiFi password on my phone! You can really sense his pride in his establishment and wants to see his guests enjoy their dinner!  We did and as Arnold says, \"We'll be back\""}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if option was given. The chicken wings are good size but extremely salty, to the point where you need two glasses of water to get through them (and I love salty food!) 
My husband and I do not eat gluten so we saw on the menu they offered \"Gluten free wraps\". well we ordered those and were excited about it, until the waitress showed up with a plate of lettuce and some cheese and tomatoes on top and I asked her what that was? And she said those were their wraps!!! Uhh??? 
A gluten free wrap that was actually NOT wrapped and it was just lettuce. She said their wraps are actually lettuce and not gluten free wraps! Very misleading menu that should be corrected to \"Lettuce wraps\" instead. 
Terrible joke. Most wasted money ever! 
Will never return."}
{"text":"The pizza was quite good, with a flavorful, crispy crust and decent. The coal-fired thing, however, seems to be just a gimmick and did not produce any discernible differences in the pizza. Service was friendly and fast. If I crave extraordinary pizza, the place won't be my choice. It's not a destination restaurant. But if I'm in the Mentor area and hungry for pizza, sure, I'll consider Tony Sacco's."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Great service! You don't need to wait to go shopping to check this place out . Parking was easy and the outside entrance is great too. We had the capo and garlic Rotolis , both were outstanding , the dipping sauce for the Rotolis was our favorite . Try the shortcake too , yummy . We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I drive past this place all the time and finally decided to give it a try during on recent 'pizza craving'.  Tony Sacco's is only a mile from my house and this could be dangerous. The pizza is amazing. No longer do I have to drive to the westside for a decent slice of pizza.

We sat at the bar and were happily surprised to hear about all of the specials. Half priced appetizers, house wine 2.25, $ 1 off beers, just to name a few. They also have special nights such as wine Wednesdays and half priced pizza on Thursday. This gave us a chance to sample a few items and try different beers. 

Our bartender, Val, was super friendly and knowledgeable on all of our beer selections. She also helped us on the menu offerings. If you like garlic, order the appetizer rolls. Amazing! We also tried the Greek pizza. The crust is the best I've had from any establishment in the Cleveland area. 

Val told us to give the wings a try. We were already full, but we'll definitely be back after she told us how they're prepared........marinated for several hours then baked. Maybe on Thursday night when it's craft beer might!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a long time!! I wish they would open in other locations near Cleveland"}
