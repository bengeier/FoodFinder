{"text":"excellent service, our waitress Hanna was great, all the food was amazing the salad dressing however was bland, but the BBQ  & all there sauces were good, definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's day. Our server was so nice she insisted we sample the beer before committing to a glass. We ordered the chopped brisket sandwich and  tipsy Texan sandwich and spicy fries. We also had the rib ends for an appetizer.  Rib ends were great. The brisket was amazing but the tipsy Texan was a work of art. 10/10 would eat again."}
{"text":"The food tastes okay, but nothing special. The prices are too expensive for what you get. The menu is a bit confusing since it doesn't give any description of the dishes, so when you order something it might NOT taste the way it think it will.... the nachos, for example, are not served the typical way with tortilla chips, and have refried beans on them (which I hate). I found that $11 was just too much to pay for some meat when nothing comes with it. You will also be disappointed spending $12 for 3 tiny tacos. Pop is not listed on the menu (that I could see), and that's probably because it's $4.00 a glass!! You can get more \"bang for your buck\" somewhere else."}
{"text":"their chicken wings are phenomenal! they have an amazing smokey flavour and are a nice size. they're pretty pricey.. but if you go on wing night they are amazing. had some bitchy servers once in a while, but overall the staff is usually awesome. even on their party nights, security are calm and collected in urgent matters and don't use excessive force on their patrons. (seriously watched a drunk guy try to choke out another drunk guy and security handled it very well... hahahaa!) bartenders are great and take the time to chat a little and ask for your name just to give you that personalized service. the manager gave us a sample platter one night when they were fairly new and we tried the turkey, brisket, chicken, and a rib and they were all soooo amazing. tender and smokey. love this place."}
{"text":"Worst place ever Don't go here unless you want the rudest services and FOOD POISONING"}
{"text":"Tried this place out last night for the first time. Service was slow and inefficient. The rib end appetizer was very good. My wife had brisket and spicy fries, which she liked, but needed to exchange spicy for regular. They are spicy!! I had pulled chicken sandwich. All I can say is SODIUM CHLORIDE OVERLOAD!  Terribly salty, I guess to try to make the beer flow. This place is not likely to be on my return list and shouldn't be on yours unless you have outstanding kidney function or just love a good salt lick."}
{"text":"This place is brutal! Literally had to push our meals to edge of the table asked for the bill and walked across the street and bought pulled pork from Costa Vida. Waste of time and $60 I'll never see again."}
{"text":"I had been wanting some good BBQ for a while. When this place opened, I had to try it. We both had the Brisket, and I would have no problem recommending it. The meat was flavourful and juicy with a nice smoke ring. It was so tender you could cut it with a spoon."}
{"text":"Four of us enjoyed Main Street last night for the first time - Airdrie has been missing a place like this.  Folks are going to say that this restaurant is just Standard Tap rebooted, but more than just a bar this place has quite a good menu and was getting busy when we arrived just before 7pm on Friday.  As a BBQ joint barometer we always start with the fried pickles - they were great but it happens we prefer them in chip rather then spear form - no big problem here.  In typical real BBQ fashion, the smoked meats, including brisket, pulled pork, turkey or pork ribs are served in 1/2 pound portions around the $10 range.  You can also get a half chicken or \"hot links\" sausage (Kielbassa).   I liked the links but found the smoked casings a bit hard to cut - if you like the sausage 'snap', you'll love these.  They happened to be out of chicken but it's ok we'll get some next time.  Sides are extra but reasonable and include the usual coleslaw and beans but more spectacular the homemade mac and cheese and sweet smoked corn - these were beautiful.  Our ordering approach (since we didn't see a sampler) was to order several meats and sides and just shared - between 4 adults this worked out great, we came away stuffed and bill (food only) came to under $70 which seemed pretty reasonable.  The good folks from Half Hitch brewery in Cochrane were trolling around giving out samples of their Farmers Daugher Pale Ale which went nicely with the BBQ...  Decore/ambiance fit the venue with lots of TV including 2 monster screens.  Staff were friendly, relaxed and in good humour, joking with our table - the assistant manager brought us into the kitchen for a quick look at their smokers, already full of the next days goodness.  Well done Main Street, best of luck...will be looking forward to our next visit...  Cheers"}
{"text":"Worst bar ever. Bouncer uses excessive force on females and the management supports it ."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat I have ever eaten hands down!! Brisket and brisket tacos were so yummy  Best food I have eaten in a long long time very friendly staff"}
{"text":"FINALLY Airdrie gets a decent bbq place... 2 months after I move to Edmonton lol.  I've managed to make it for lunch  twice and both times it was awesome. The Mac and cheese is a little to reminiscent of nacho cheese for me but otherwise everything else I've had is excellent. The brisket is very good and I'm in love with their espresso BBQ sauce. Their green beans are phenomenal and for a little kick throw some BBQ sauce on them! Yum."}
{"text":"Our favourite Airdrie pub!  Great beer, food and service!   This place never disappoints!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i came here last weekend. Service was pretty good. I tried a Raspberry beer, not sure of the brand, and it was really good. The food was incredible, although a tad pricey for the portion sizes, and also no descriptions of menu items which would have been more helpful. We tried the brisket, pork ribs, and smoked (hot) chicken wings.Ive never had brisket from a restaurant before but it was amazing! The chicken wings were probably the best I've ever had. Our sides were the baked beans, potato salad, cornbread, and poutine with brisket gravy. All so so so perfect. Highly recommend this place and we will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. Not a lot for the money but good quality. Service was decent and cheerful. I would go again."}
