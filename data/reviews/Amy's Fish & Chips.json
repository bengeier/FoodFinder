{"text":"Best halibut and chips around. The fish is never greasy and the homemade gravy is delicious. The owner is a delight and always welcomes us warmly when we come in."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since it opened, as there are very few fish and chips restaurants in Richmond Hill. This is a small place in a plaza with plenty of parking.  My boyfriend and I ordered to go - a haddock combo which came with 2 pieces of fish and 1 order of fries - about a 10min wait, as the fish is fried to order. The fish were well portioned and the fries were quite large. The fish was perfectly fried - thin crispy batter with delicious moist fish on the inside. Fries are thick and potato-y.   The service was friendly and the food was delicious.  My fish and chips craving was fulfilled and I definitely plan to come back here!"}
{"text":"They make their fish and chip on the spot. A family run business and food prepared by Amy herself. We watched her dip a nice fresh filet of haddock in batter and fried it up. For $8.95 you get a large portion of fish and freshly thick cut fries. I love supporting local family businesses and you can tell the locals having dinner around us just loves her fish. This place is brand new and I'm so glad we have a new go to spot for fish and chips in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"The fish and chips here is pretty good. Not the best but not something I regret. I know thats not a glowing endorsemet but I have pretty high standards for fish and chips. especially the chips. And this place met my standard.   The price is about average. The portions are a tiny bit smaller than at most other places I have been. I only had the fish and chips so I can't vouch for anything else on the menu.   The service was very good and we had a party of 6 and they were able to serve us and 2 or 3 other tables with no problem (I only mention this because some places seem to get slower on some sort of exponential curve when they have more than one table occupied - but NOT this place!!)  I will definitely return here."}
{"text":"Dined in this time and received 10% off by mentioning the yelp dine in discount.  Quite a few tables occupied during lunch hours.  Hope it continues to do well so this local gem sticks around!"}
{"text":"If your looking for excellent Fish and Chips in Richmond Hill, go here.  The place was very clean.  Floor was not greasy like so many other Fish and Chips places I've been to.    I had 2 pc Halibut and chips, wife had 1 pc Halibut, 5 shrimps and chips.  Fish was excellent, not too greasy, lightly battered, crunchy and perfectly cooked inside.  You really taste the flavour of the halibut.  We liked it so much, we bought 2 extra pieces for our kids when they come home.  Coleslaw was very good.  Not too vinegary.  Prices were very reasonable.  We use to go to York Fish and Chips but not anymore.   You want excellent Halibut fish and chips in Richmond Hill, this is the place."}
{"text":"Overall: 4.5 stars  Food: Excellent. Keep in mind I'm expecting heavy, greasy food, whenever I think of fish and chips in general.   I ordered haddock for two, dining in. We were seated promptly and the lady up front took our order. The haddock was made a la carte and came out fresh. The fish was lightly battered and not too heavy at all. It was light golden in colour, which to me, means the oil was fresh. My first few bites were flavourful without any condiments, but obviously it was even nicer with the tartar on the side. There's plenty of chips (fries) on the side and we couldn't finish them all. The coleslaw was nice, cool and crunchy too.   Service: The lady who served us was friendly and helpful. No complaints here.   Parking: Plenty of parking around in the plaza during lunch time on a weekday. No issues there.  Overall impressions: Great establishment in the neighbourhood. It has that local mom'n'pop type of feel and I love that. They serve non fish options as well but I haven't had a chance to try it. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and love that it's family owned. This restaurant is always clean, service is fast and very friendly. Located in a plaza with lots of parking.  We ordered the haddock, fries and pop ($8.95) + a kids meal of halibut, fries and pop ($6.96) this time. The lightly battered fish is crispy on the outside and so tasty on the inside! Never soggy. And the kids just gobble up the thicker cut fries. The kids portion of fish was a good size for a young child. A great casual spot for the whole family and there was quite a few people coming in to pick up take out as well."}
{"text":"Had the combo for 2 (4 pieces of Halibut and fries) and the fish was amazing! Lightly battered and not greasy at all! Generous amount of fries, enough for 2 to share. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Super friendly family owned restaurant. The food was cooked great, with clean oil. The fish was perfectly battered and the chicken fingers were super crispy. The fries were also very fresh (and we even heard the owner peeling the potatoes)."}
{"text":"I had the halibut and chips and the fries came out great but not totally crispy - which is OK with me as I don't mind either.  The fish was about the same as most other place's single piece.  This place splits them out to two smaller pieces which I prefer more.  The batter was light and crispy and the thickness of the fish was pretty good and had good texture.  Would definitely come back to try out the other offerings."}
{"text":"RIchmond Hill was totally in need of another Gish & Chip restaurant and Amy's is my 1st choice now!  Tried it for the first time today.  Friends staff (apparently family owned and run) and great food.  We ordered take out, but the sit down area was clean and comfortable.  Very simple.  Tasted the fish when we got home and am happy to say I loved it!  Delicious!!!! Light and crispy...totally making this my go-to f&c joint.  Reasonably priced too!!"}
{"text":"This was the location of our book club. We were there Sunday and it was supposed to be open but wasn't but just as we were about to leave, the owner came in.  I had a haddock combo with chips, salad and a drink. It might have been the special of the day. I forgot the price but it was very reasonable. Fish and chips is not my favourite but they do do it well. I went to one in Tobermory that was supposed to be really good but was average. This was good, but was it that much better than fish and chips that you can order at any pub? Maybe ever so slightly. If it is any better, it is not that significant. Of course, I am not an aficionado of this type of food.  Maybe it is like me and pho, where many places do it well and I am perfectly satisfied with what I get which on average is excellent. However, I am not expecting any one place to have out-of-this-world pho. With fish and chips I expect pretty good and not many places screw it up or create something sublime.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Solid fish and chips.  I will order again for sure.  The fish portions could be bigger - perhaps they might be, this was my first time.  The fries were excellent.  It's a small little take-out counter with about 10 or so tables for eating in.   No LLBO."}
{"text":"Have been looking for a good fish and chips place around my area and I think this is it. Fish was nicely fried and tastes great. Fries were ok but we all enjoyed the fish very much. We will be back when we are craving fish and chips again!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times as I like my fish n chips lightly battered and this place does them just perfectly. Nice and light, with a nice portion of fries and coleslaw. They could give more tarter sauce though especially when serving 2 pieces of fish. A tiny cup (holds about a tablespoon) isn't sufficient .  If they fix that up and the decor/cleanliness I would give them 5*'s. Newspapers in their front fridge and a bit of smelly cloth smell can be easily fixed."}
{"text":"The two of us ordered the family meal with 4 pieces of halibut and 1 generous portion of fries@22.95.  The fish tasted good, batter was nice and light and fried in fresh oil. Fries were just okay. The cuts of fish were generous for the price. Would go again"}
{"text":"They serve the best Fish & Chips in town. I've added family plate to go so my kids can enjoy them. Their service is great too."}
{"text":"Went here with my mum for fish & chips. We shared the halibut meal for 2 (4 pieces of fish with fries) and my mum wanted onion rings so we got those too. Fish was perfect - nicely battered but not greasy and you didn't get that tongue coated with oil feeling that you get after a lot of fish and chips. Onion rings were amazing. Fries were good but nothing I'd rave about. Service was prompt and friendly. Ambiance is lacking but it's a fish & chip joint. I just want good fish and this is exactly that. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I came with a couple of friends and I had the special that came haddock, fries and a pop. The staff were friendly and the wait for the food was not long. The fish portion of the meal was pretty good, but cannot say the same for the fries. They were a bit bland and the texture wasn't there. My friend is a gravy-addict, and she was satisfied with their fare. I would definitely come back for the fish, but might sub out the fries for an alternative."}
{"text":"Overall very good service! The owner, Amy is very friendly and so is I believe her son! Makes you feel good about where your money is going and I really hope this restaurant runs for a long time!   Now for the food... For $8.50 the portion for haddock is excellent, even including a drink! The only bad part were the chips. They were extremely bland with no seasoning. Maybe they forgot for my meal...not sure. But otherwise, very excellent place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little spot that filled the fish & chip void in my life.  Nice light and crispy batter served with dutch style french fries.  We tried the shrimp, scallops, halibut and haddock.  I loved the fish but was just okay with the shrimps and scallops.   It's a located just west of Leslie and Elgin Mills in the Starbucks plaza (which also has a nice pizza joint, Nonna's Pizza).  This place will be a go to spot for us."}
{"text":"This place is great! I didn't realize they had closed when I walked into the restaurant and instead of turning me away the owner took care of me. She was really patient while I decided what I wanted to order and had a great conversation with me while I waited for the food. The food is fresh and delicious. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Must Try: Fish and Chips (duh) - Halibut (preferable) or Cod (also acceptable)  Rating: (10/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (8/10) Ambience, (9/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness  My Experience:    Finding the perfect fish and chip shop is like looking for a good hairdresser, everyone has their preferences but almost no one lives up to the expectations. Amy's Fish & Chips is the perfect hairdresser I've been looking for.   Their fish and chips have the right (light) amount of flaky batter, so that the fish is still the stand out star. The quality of fish is great and large, and the pieces were fried perfectly. We tried both the halibut and cod, both of which were amazing, with halibut winning out. The fries are exactly what I expect for my fish and chip order, thicker fries, with a nice texture.   The seating and feel is very rustic and old school, a no frills restaurant with a family vibe and delicious food. The service is very friendly, and provide both take out and sit down orders."}
{"text":"been wanting to try this place for a while now. had a chance today to grab some , saw a lot of good reviews but meh . nothing special about this place . the portions are small compared to what i usually get , the halibut's are cut into pieces , when i saw the menu i assumed each piece will be the size of my hand, but nope they weren't . kinda disappointing tbh . but o well .   prob won't be coming back just because i could get more for less $$ somewhere else ."}
{"text":"Small location, but great food and atmosphere. My kids love their homemade batter and their prices are very reasonable.  So far we have had their Shrimp, Halibut and Cod and all have been great."}
{"text":"Its the best fish and chips ever!!! The dough which the haddock was deep fried in was just so crisp and perfect. The salad with it was divine and the fresh cut fries were made to perfection."}
{"text":"Food was reasonably priced and the fish was well battered and not overly oily.   Service was great - attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Got the halibut dinner for 3. Comes with 6 pieces of fish and 2 orders of chips. We changed one of them to a poutine   Best fish and chips in the area and great value.  Just the right amount of batter. Light and crispy"}
{"text":"Went to Amy's Fish & Chip tonight.  We had the halibut dinner for 5 people.  Amy grilled 2 of the 10 halibuts for my father which he taught was perfectly cooked.   He is pretty old and cannot handle salt, pepper or too much oil.     The other 8 halibuts were covered with a light and crispy batter.  The fries were excellent with the gravy.   Gravy was homemade and not from a can.  I agree with most of the reviews posted on Yelp and hope this place sticks around for a while.  It's now my favorite fish & chip place since Old Galley went out of business.  Overall, I give this place 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant with freshly made fish and chips, highly recommend. Fries are freshly cut and good portion sizes."}
{"text":"Really impressed with these fish and chips. With 4 adults and 2 children, we ordered the family meal. It came with 10 pieces of halibut, large fries, coleslaw and gravy. When it comes to fish and chips, halibut is the best and the fish here was very juicy, flakey and crispy on the outside. The fries were also delicious even though they looked under cooked and the coleslaw was decent, but it was an extremely tiny portion for a family meal for 5. The restaurant itself is sort of a hole in the wall, but for the price and taste, I didn't mind the atmosphere. I'll definitely come back here whenever I'm craving fish and chips."}
{"text":"Fish and fries fried perfectly. As simple as that sounds, some restaurants can't do this right.  Only thing I wish they had was a wow factor. Unique flavour.   More fast food style. Wouldn't take date to this place. More of a snack size bro food run."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! We ordered a Halibut family pack for 5 for our lunch today and the portion was big enough. Fries were freshly made, coleslaw was in the right taste, and he 10-piece- Halibut were absolutely amazing.  Thanks Amy."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Reasonably priced and pretty decent portions.  Service was really friendly and attentive. Place is small but it is OK. Would come back for sure."}
{"text":"A great place for Fish and Chips!  Everything are so Fresh.  Thanks everyone for the great review and got me to try this place.   The fish are not greasy and batter are thin!  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"A mom-and-pop joint only open for a couple of months so far. Nice light crispy batter on both the haddock and cod we had and the fish tasted fresh. Coleslaw had enjoyable acidity and tang. They didn't renovate the place too much from the previous restaurant (Mr. kebab)."}
{"text":"The haddock was not over battered or too greasy! The fish pieces were also a good size - not faked by thick batter! The coleslaw is better and more creamy than most fish and chip places I've had it at. The fries are thick!   Very quick hidden gem! Don't let the decor deter you."}
{"text":"Thought we would try Amy's instead of our usual Fish & Chips place. First the good: Chips were very good, and the portion was great. Batter on the fish was light and crisp.  The fish portion, sad to say, was smaller than what we are used to, and the price was 20-25% higher. The higher price on its own didn't seem bad, since the order description said there were two pieces. Unfortunately, the two pieces combined were about 75% the size of the single piece from our usual.  I rated them three stars because the food was good, but I'll be sticking with my usual place for a better value."}
{"text":"Very good old school family owned and operated (I think) fish and chip place in Richmond Hill.  I actually found them by accident when I was next door sharpening my skates.   Great find!  They were really busy but everyone pitched in (including their cute little boy to serve us our fries).  Very fast, efficient and polite.   Now the food:   Very light batter and not oily when is great.  We were able to substitute one of our family order fries with onion rings at no extra cost which is great.  The salad was fresh and crunchy too.  Top notch fish/chips and great service in an unassuming strip mall in Richmond Hill.   If you like fish/chips you must try it!"}
{"text":"Been reading the reviews in the area and decided upon Amy's. Simple, straightforward and good, Amy's has the hallmarks of a great fish 'n chips shop.   On a quiet Sunday afternoon we decided to stop in for a quick bite, just before the evening rush. We ordered a one piece halibut and another with 5 shrimps. The fish was fresh, the batter light and not greasy which one might expect. There was a nice smidge of tartar sauce, coleslaw and a wedge of lemon. The quality was good, the service efficient and attentive. From a price point perspective, it is about $10.00 for the one piece, $12.00 with the shrimp and all in was $26.00. for checking in, we received a 10% discount which was a pleasant surprise.   Overall, I agree with the majority of the reviews in terms of location, value and price. Maybe a bit of a larger portion on the one piece would be nice, but would likely order the 4 piece next time! Good job!"}
{"text":"Reasonable price local fish and chips joint. Owner very friendly to ensure all customers in the cozy joint is well looked after. Lots of take out orders while we were there. Fish, chips are made to order. Salads fresh. Would definitely come back with my family."}
{"text":"Fish and chips are just okay. Nothing special or stand out from a British perspective. Some of the higher ranking reviews are probably a bit higher because the price is cheap. Give it a shot and see for yourself. They use canola oil if you are okay with that."}
{"text":"Ok.....ordered dinner for 3: huge amounts of chips, 6 pieces of, what I would consider, mediocre sized halibut fish. It was more like chips with a side of fish..... The taste was subpar from other fish and chips places and the fish was a bit on the oily side. Overall would recommend other fish and chip places. I miss Fry's Basket down at Steeles and Yonge. Unparalleled taste, portion size and pricing. 2 star because their service wasn't bad at all."}
{"text":"This is our second time coming to Amy's Fish and Chips. Looks like a family run business. Her son and mom hang out at he restaurant and help out from time to time. The place has been pretty quiet both times I came for lunch.  In terms of food, the batter on the fish is done just right. Everything is made to order. We had the chicken wrap once and the chicken was a bit dry. Their specials of fish and chips with a drink comes to less than $10. Definitely a great deal!   The decoration and furniture appear to belong to previous owners, and the lights aren't turned on during the day... so dining in wasn't too comfortable from a lack of ambience and comfortable seating. It feels much more like a fast food joint than a restaurant.   The fish and chips here are definitely worth  eating but we will be getting take out instead."}
{"text":"Service: good Food: excellent Price: fair  Great family run fish and chip place. I ordered the halibut and chips special which came with a drink for under $10. The fish was not overly battered, but still had a nice crisp to it. I definitely recommend going to Amy's fish and chips and giving it a try."}
{"text":"Amy's Fish & Chips is a family owned and run local business.  Amy personally cooked the food and served us the day we patronized.  We ordered one of each type of fish: halibut, haddock and cod, with salad and fries.  All were pretty well made.  The batter was crunchy, thin, flaky, and most impressively not oily at all.  This is a good batter.  Inside the batter, the fish was moist.  Amy told me that she mixed her own batter to make a non-oily batter, since people like to eat healthier nowadays.  I would say Amy is an experienced cook of fish and chips, as the cooking is at par with more established fish and chips places.  The chips were average.  The salad was very fresh.  The tartar is rich, creamy and tangy.  The place is very clean.  Portion wise, the haddock was the most generous, the cod second and the halibut the last.  Order the haddock if you want the best bang for the buck, or the cod for a softer texture.  Of course, halibut reins supreme for meaty texture, but be forewarned that the halibut fish filet is only slightly bigger than half of a haddock.   Overall, the rating is 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"A strong 4 1/2 stars. Popped in today for lunch. The female staff member (Amy?) asked if we were dining in or taking out. When we said dining in, she advised to sit wherever we wanted. She also told us that the menus were on the tables, which they were. She was over about a minute later, as she overheard us say we knew what we wanted....2 orders of Halibut and chips and 2 Diet Pepsi. I asked for lightly battered and she advised us that all their orders are cooked with a light batter...which was correct. After less than 10 minutes, out came the order. Each halibut and chips had 2 generous pieces of fish each, with a substantial amount of fries (cooked perfectly) p, tartar sauce and lemon wedge. The fries were very good, the fish was excellent. Lightly battered, moist, flavourful....it was worth the trip. Ambiance isn't the best, but it's a fish and chips place and decor is better than some other places I've  been to. Two orders Halibut and chips, 2 Diet Pepsi, tax in...just over $32. Well worth it. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Haven't had Fish & Chips in a while...checked Yelp and Amy's Fish & Chips was rated quite high...so, I decided to check it out.  A small and clean establishment in a strip plaza...service was friendly and prices on par for your standard order of fish & chips.  In all fairness, I find fish & chips are all the same in the sense that taste, portion, and price are generally similar...only major differences that one can comment are batter texture, french fries crispiness/cut, coleslaw, and tartar sauce (if homemade).  We ordered a halibut fish & chips and also a couple fish & chips. It was freshly made and everything from the food to the portion was okay...it wasn't to die for nor was it bad...the fish had a lightly coated batter with gently crisp to it & not too oily and the chips were freshly chunky cut, blanched, and fried. The tartar sauce was homemade and tasty but the portion of the sauce was very small. The dish also came with some homemade coleslaw (creamy kind) and it was fresh and lite.  If you're in the mood for fish & chips and in the neighborhood, sure why not...thus, my 3 start rating."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Richmond Hill. Came at 5:00pm on Sunday evening, we just needed some quick dinner after reading some good reviews. I have to agree with other reviewers. This is a family restaurant, small but cozy, clean dining area and washroom.  Service is very casual and friendly, just perfect for a casual quick dining for Sunday night.  We ordered halibut family meal $22.95 for two, 1 piece of haddock $7.25 an its own and small Greek Salad $4.25. All very decent size, fresh and delicious, the best so far in Richmond Hill.  We highly commend it to anyone who would like a quick and quality meal. I would give 5 stars if they don't have sign hanging with Dollar rama price lable beside visible or power bar cord visible on the floor."}
{"text":"The fish & chips were pretty nice. The person running the restaurant wasn't so nice. I felt like she had disdain for everything we said. Still, if you don't mind feeling like you're being served by a bitter ex-girlfriend, then the fish is fresh and cooked quite well :)"}
{"text":"SO HAPPY I discovered this little gem place near my house. I've ordered take out here a few times and the food is quite fresh. They make it right away for you rather than premaking and having it sit out. The fish portion is a little small, but they make up for it by giving a ton of fries, but overall very good!"}
{"text":"Richmond Hill has been in dire need of a good fish and chip shop since the closure of our dearly beloved Old Galley. I think Amy has finally come to bestow our town with her rendition of this delicious classic. Although my experiences have been limited to take out, I've been pretty impressed. The fish is fresh, tasty, not too greasy and isn't over-battered. The fries are thick-cut, a little soggy and very satisfying. Coleslaw is on point and perfectly creamy."}
{"text":"This is my go-to fish and chips place since it's so close to where I live.  The other one is Allen Court and I have been meaning to do a Coke-Pepsi competition some day.  Amy's is great - the fish is done just right - it's crispy on the outside and nice and tender on the inside.  I usually get the halibut and haven't gone wrong yet!  Family run and operated so the service is good even though I usually get take out.   Have gone back again and again."}
{"text":"4.5  I love the halibut fish and chips from here! Once you've tried this, the frozen ones from the grocery store cannot compare and you won't settle for the grocery store bought version of fried fish.  Amy's has a simple, clean storefront in the Starbucks plaza off Elgin Mills. It's not particularly fancy, but upon entering you feel a home-y, comfortable atmosphere filled with the aroma of freshly fried foods. They serve classic fish and chips, and execute it PERFECTLY. The fish is lightly battered but is amazingly crisp when served (even if you get take-out and bring it home, it still retains its crispiness). The fries are also great - thick cut fries that go well with the fish.   They also serve cod fillets, which are great too, but I prefer the halibut. The size of the fish is also generous, and you get really great value for your meal.   They also have some nice sides of coleslaw and salad which are equally as yummy to the fries as a side.   It's honestly one of the best fish and chips place around. I always look forward to my visit!"}
{"text":"Amy's Fish & Chips is probably the best in the neighbourhood.  Nice and friendly owner. And good solid food and a great price.  I love how light and crispy my Haddock was. The fish still nice and moist. My chips though was a mix of cold and warm. Probably because half of that was not freshly fried.  Amy was nice enough to offer to make us more fresh fries after we brought that to her attention.  Their special probably the best deal since it comes with a drink too!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff....friendly and cozy environment!  Don't be fooled by this oriental family, they can make a heck of a halibut...."}
{"text":"Fish was lightly breaded and very nicely seasoned. Everything was fresh and cooked fast. Price wasn't too expensive. Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"Where to go for Fish and Chips?  Hmmmm....Allencourt?  Their OK but I find it to be a bit too heavy and greasy.  Fry Basket - nope...got way too expensive for some reason.  Flip the YelpApp and boom, Amy's shows up and reviewed by many of my Yelpie-Friends.  Did the read and off we went.  $8.50 for haddock or cod - fish and chips.  They also had a halibut sandwich for the same price.  What a special - it included a pop too!  Wait...maybe it's not good!  Maybe the portions are really small and the fish is off!  Nope!  It's a good serving of food.  Absolutely surprised.  The lady there - I'm assuming it's Amy was busy working away on some paperwork when we got there.  A young lad was at the till and we ordered up a haddock and a cod.  Also got a Halibut and Chips too.  Try all their wares at once...see what we like...right?!?  We sat down and Amy went off to do her thing.  In no time, we had perfectly golden and crispy battered fish with a good amount of chips.  A sprinkle of salt, a splash of vinegar and everything was done in no time.  Amy runs a good clean ship here.  The young lad was very efficient and polite.  Definitely a repeat place and my go to for F&C.  My favourite place for F&C was off the coast of Newfoundland, on a small island, but that's a bit far to go so Amy's it is.  Cheers!"}
