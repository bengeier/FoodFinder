{"text":"I had high hopes for the coffee here, but sadly I was disappointed - my americano came out burnt tasting.   The interior was fairly large with space for lounging or working, but the decor definitely was not to my taste - kinda like a Homesense shop - kitschy things everywhere that didn't really have a rhyme or reason. I know some people love this sorta thing (think framed plaque that says \"ESPRESSO YOURSELF\" in quirky fonts) but it's definitely not for me."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore the decoration and the taste of the coffee at Goldstruck. BUT! THIS SERVER at the bar (who makes coffee)is being so rude and super unpolite. She didnt give me the coffee I want, and she blamed on ME and mocked at me. RIDICULOUS! I guess she is being RACIST, because I am not a White-Canadian. The cashier, however, was very kind. This is my first time write bad review for a store, I will never go there because of her. It is a shame because the coffee are so tasty. Canada is a society with equality, I have never been so angry."}
{"text":"He interior is beautiful, nice ambience and very well lit. There was nice music playing and almost every seat was filled, mainly with people on their laptops.   I ordered an Americano that tasted very weak and nothing special. I always drink my coffee black without sugar.   I more than likely won't return as I would prefer a great coffee to a nice place."}
{"text":"IF YOU LIKE STRONG AMERICANOS, be sure to ask for less water. The staff put a lot of water in Americanos by default, probably to serve the mixed tourist/local clientele. However, when not watered down, the coffee is excellent. Even flavoured, not citrusy or sour.  If I lived in the area, this would likely be my daily coffee shop. If you're looking for real coffee (not Starbucks or Tim Hortons), you'll find it here. Note that I only drink espresso-based coffee, so I can't comment on Goldstruck's drip coffee (if they even have any).   Nice cozy basement atmosphere with typical trendy-caf√© furnishings. A hidden gem with integrity in often superficial Yorkville."}
{"text":"I ordered americano with bad taste I asked the barista to change it or different beans answered was this is the only beans we have.  I dont know if its from the mug or beans but bad communication with the customers and good customer service should satisfy everyone for success"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but no tea selection - only green tea which tastes slightly of mushrooms? I believe it was a rishi blend, or a cranberry tea. Not many options if coffee is not your favorite,"}
{"text":"super cute little spot. Nice coffee"}
{"text":"The customer service in Toronto sucks and this place is no exception! I've been here twice now. Today was the last time... literally. It wasn't even busy around 3:30pm when the barista (tall, Mediterranean looking guy with dark curly hair) took my order, and then proceeded to fumble around on the stereo for what felt like an entire minute, while he complained to the other counter person working with him about not liking the music that was currently playing. Rather than making my Americano, they both started messing around trying to figure out how change the station, while I just stood there thinking to myself, \"Wow this is some sh!tty customer service.\" If I were the owner of this cafe, I would try to step up the customer service experience, so that people who live in the neighbourhood actually want to return to this location on a regular basis, instead of going to one of the other 20 coffee shops on this street. Just sayin\"."}
{"text":"Came here to get a bit of work done before an appointment in the neighbourhood. At 2pm on a Friday, it was surprisingly busy with all sorts of people: students, shoppers and tourists. Although many of the two seater tables were filled up, at the back there is a communal table that will fit about 6-8 people comfortably. I ordered a flat white and personally, I felt it was too milky. It tasted more like latte - which isn't a bad thing but I was expecting a flat white. The music is not the best as noted by another reviewer, but i generally listen to my own music anyways or I'm too involved in a conversation and forget the music is even there. It does get loud when it is busy.   Overall, I think it's a nice place to get work done if you're in the area and you don't mind nose, but I would go somewhere else if I wanted to enjoy a delicious caffeinated beverage."}
{"text":"A nice place with decent coffee. Baked goods could be better, but we usually bring our own cookies anyway."}
{"text":"This is a cute little cafe. It's super small and there isn't that much space for seating if it gets crowded. Their cookies are very tasty!!"}
{"text":"Nice little coffee shop. Quiet, spacious. I like the warm light inside. Super friendly staff. Had my favorite combination: flat white and almond croissant. The flat white was perfect in terms if taste, but presentation could be improved. The beans they use are organic. The croissant was okay, not too flaky, still prefer the ones at Sorry coffee co. across the street. Definitely going back for coffee."}
{"text":"A cute little coffee shop tucked away on Cumberland St in Yorkville. Honestly, everything on Cumberland St is \"tucked away\"; all the places are small and squished into a small area. That being said, Goldstruck has super low ceilings which may make it seems slightly claustrophobic to some but it's quite a large space. It's quite a \"lengthy\" coffee shop and you'll see what I mean if you ever visit.   I got a flat white and my friend got a cappuccino and we both a cute little heart in our coffees, and they were super cute. The actual coffee itself was delicious. Normally I'm not big on enjoying the bitterness of coffee and I prefer it on the sweeter side but this flat white was delicious as is. It was very smooth and perfect for sipping on a chilly (March) afternoon.   There isn't really much to say about a coffee shop. If the coffee is good and the ~ vibes ~ are good then its a good coffee shop. And Goldstruck is a good coffee shop.  Next time I'm getting the Vanilla Raf!"}
{"text":"This place has a beautiful decor and some great drinks!"}
{"text":"Goldstruck coffee fits the York Ville area very well. It has a fantastic interior design and a generous seating area. The service is exquisite and quick, and the prices are also very reasonable. The items on the menu are a bit limited, but they have a few different coffee specialties for hardcore coffee fans that you do not find in most coffee shops across the GTA. They also have a few creative latte flavors.   If you come to Yorkville you have to stop here, even if you are just going for a tour. They do deserve a 5-star rating, but it would be unfair to them as they are a new business, and there are minor things they need to improve on. The menu needs to be a bit more descriptive for amateur coffee drinkers, and perhaps a few, not too many, items need to be added to the menu to cover more type of customers. As it stands, it is a bit too coffee-heavy."}
{"text":"The interior design of the cafe is very nice and modern yet relaxed. All their hot beverages can be iced which was nice but their menu list wasn't much. Decent amount of seating area. Wi-Fi was not really strong and didn't connect most of the time. They didn't play any music which I found very odd. If you're trying to catch up with a friend or anything I wouldn't recommend this cafe because everyone will hear you."}
{"text":"Love this coffee joint. The first time I went, I looked at the menu and ordered the vanilla raf coffee. Maybe I just got lucky and stumbled on this drink, but this is the only thing I get now because it tastes and smells so good. I just wish they made their drinks with a little more consistency (sometimes it's a little watery, or the foam consistency isn't quite right)."}
{"text":"One thing's for sure - you feel so hip thumbing through a magazine or working on your Macbook in this cafe. The decor is minimal, unique and inviting. The barista was definitely friendly. It might take you a couple orders before you know what your \"regular\" will be - they have things like \"halva latte\", made with the indian/middle eastern dessert, halwa/halua.   3 stars because the cookie I got was a bit too sweet and the coffee was alright. I wasn't overly impressed - there weren't a lot of option (but I guess, coffee is coffee?) Its a good place to check out or to enjoy a coffee while waiting for a friend, a bit off the beaten path and the ambiance is very nice."}
{"text":"Quaint little coffee shop tucked away in Yorkville. There seems to be plenty of seats in this cafe (compared to a lot of the independent cafes in Toronto anyway) and I like the minimalist decor. I ordered matcha and shared half a chocolate chip cookie with my boyfriend. Cookie was good. There really wasn't anything outstanding about Goldstruck to be honest. Overall, okay place to stop by for a visit."}
{"text":"Super cute little coffee shop in Yorkville.  Cozy atmosphere with a fair amount of seating. Looks to be a great place to bring a laptop and get some work done.  Enjoyed a deliciously smooth Americano while waiting to meet a friend for lunch.   Will return again soon!!"}
{"text":"I had the unfortunate experience of ordering a cortado for 4$ at this coffee shop. I couldn't order tea because they only had two bad options available.  Not only was the drink watered down, it was also so bad. The barista didn't even finish the drink with a rosette. Normally that wouldn't be an issue. But if you're charging me that much money for a tiny drink I expect something of it. Never coming here again. Save yourself the time and money."}
{"text":"Very good coffee.  The decor and interior very pleasant.  This addition really adds to a DRAB stretch of Cumberland/Yorkville.  Main NEGATIVE.. I know it's subjective, the music HORRIBLE. Really bad dance mix of Bel biv devoe, other cheesy dance tracks. You hope the music compliments not hinders the experience, most individuals on a laptop, having conversation will hate it."}
{"text":"This is a welcome addition to the Yorkville area.  Opening just a couple days ago, one could easily see the place still needs a bit of fine tuning. It's beautiful and clean but somewhat sparse. It lacks warmth. Don't get me wrong, it's lovely but it's just missing that something that makes it their own Goldstruck rather than a successful execution of a reclaimed, hipster modern interior.   The most important thing, the coffee. Acquired from a local roaster, the latte was wonderful. Rich and lingering on the palette, the coffee exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, coffee is well balanced and not too acidic. Also, the wifi is pretty reliable and there's a decent amount of seating. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a coffee after my hair appointment at Toni and Guy. I'd rate it 2.5 for the latte and 4.5 for the interior design. Since this is fundamentally a coffee place I rounded that out to a 3/5.  It's absolutely beautiful inside, I love how they decorated it. It has a minimalist industrial wooden vibe. In the entrance there is a coffee concepts chalk board with a hessian sack full of coffee beans. There are individual and communal tables along the wall each with an individual and unique light bulb hanging above. The counter is wooden and decorated with fancy pour over equipment. The washrooms are in the same theme with the doors faux wood and nice iron hooks inside. I think this would be a nice place to work. The tables were full but because the place is spacious it was still quiet and peaceful.  As for the service and coffee, both were just ok. The girl who served me and the barista were neither overly friendly or unfriendly, nor were they in a particular hurry. The almond milk latte was 5.37 and just ok. Is was a pretty big coffee - steamed milk bubbles at the top so not my preferred crema, and no latte art. The milk seemed thin, not sure which one that they used. I did like the beautiful cup and saucer it came in.  Would I return? Maybe to try an Americano or pour over. If I was in Yorkville and wanted a latte to go I'd probably stick with Sorry. But this place has a much nicer ambiance if you want to sit down."}
{"text":"I may have found my new favourite cafe for the Yorkville area! While there are other independent cafes in the 'hood (Sorry, Zaza), the seating is often really limited. Goldstruck is way more spacious than it looks from the outside. Lots of seating and the space is inviting and cozy. When I came in on a Saturday morning, they had just taken the baked goods out of the oven and it smelled divine. I had to try their whole grain croissant which was super buttery, flaky, and still warm. My cappuccino was solid as well. Service was swift and attitude-free. I hope they bring in a loyalty stamp card... ;)"}
{"text":"Based on a very unscientific study, I've decided this coffee shop has some of the best croissants in the city! I've had them a few times and they're always suuuuper fresh. Coffee is good too, today I had a decaf iced Americano. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Awesome place with cozy atmosphere for studying and working. Their Vanilla Raf is the best coffee drink I've tasted in my entire life. This will definitely become my go-to place for coffee and work meetings with my business partner."}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to the Yorkville area.   The decor is so cool.  I've have had their Halva and Vanilla latte and both were superb.   I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop in Yorkville. Definitely gives off the \"hip\" vibes. We ordered a tea and a coffee and both were well made.   They steeped my tea in a little steeper which was nice, so i didn't have to worry about where to dump my teabag.   The place is a bit narrow, but has a good amount of tables of you to do work at."}
{"text":"Had goldstruck coffee for the first time this past weekend. The place is surprisingly big and very busy inside. The main draw for me was that their beans are apparently roasted within 14 days, which I thought would be cool.   On this particular sunday afternoon, there was one cashier and one barista. The barista and the cashier seem to constantly have miscommunication as the barista doesn't know how many or what drinks to make. They also don't take your name down when you order, so when they call out \"latte\", everyone kinda walks towards the drink.. As such, the wait was a bit long.   The latte was fine, but nothing special. There was no latte art, just a straight pour of the steamed milk into the espresso shot. There was also alot of foam...more than a latte should.   Nothing particularly good interesting about this place, so I would not come back."}
{"text":"Tried their iced latte. Decent but nothing special. Definitely better coffee in the area. The space is cool looking but pretty dark because it's below ground with just one window at the front."}
{"text":"In the heart of Yorkville, a gem of a place for excellent coffee. This is the only place worth your time and money in the area."}
{"text":"Its a cute place, a bit stuffy inside, coffe was ok, a bit mild, i would like a more bold/stronger/ more prominent taste"}
{"text":"LOVING the coffee & vibe of this cafe !! They only have a small menu but it has some delicious coffee drinks. If you are in the Yorkville area, come try them as an excellent alternative to the 3 (yes 3) Starbucks in the area. The cheese pastry is so buttery, rich & delish, I had 2! The Vanilla RAF coffee, decaf with almond milk, is one of the best I've had. Not sure what the RAF stands for. They are open 7am - 9pm, 7 days a week. They took a gamble by opening their cafe infront of a Starbucks & it worked!"}
{"text":"It was a bit hard to find because it was below ground. Ambience was great and nice decor. I had a flat white and was $3.75 and tastes great. But i wish they did latte art. Washrooms were very clean. Came here in thr afternoon during IceFest so it was pretty busy. One thing negative that I over heard was this barista complaining to another barista just came to work that it was so busy and how he hates making cayenne lattes and if customers ask him what it is he will jus say nothing much special so that he does not need to make it because it takes so long. Also they did not have napkins for customers? Or they ran out and neve refilled it the while hour we were there?"}
{"text":"coffee is good. The staff are not that friendly. Generally good. The environment is perfect."}
{"text":"Ordered both the halva latte and the cayenne mocha; the first was a little sweet for my palette but that could just be me. The cayenne mocha was delicious but could have been served hotter, good customer service."}
{"text":"This is the best coffee I have tried. I bring my friends to this place all the time and every single one of them falls involve with Vanilla Raf or Halva Latte. Staff is super nice and friendly, they make you feel very welcomed every time. The design of this place is nice! You never see someone putting so much work and thought into a coffee shop."}
{"text":"A+ on the atmosphere! Great place to work or catch up with friends. They have lots of 2-seater tables with a 8-seater rectangular table at the back. Free wifi here too! We got a cranberry detox tea and a green iced tea per their recommendations. Unfortunately, it tastes quite diluted so hopefully better luck with coffee next time."}
{"text":"Very cozy and warm place! Lack of space, but still OK. For small companies=)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, customer service, and location. Perfect for studying or a coffee date. Manager and owner are really sweet and the washrooms are adorable! They may take a while to make your coffee though."}
{"text":"Strictly from a specialty coffee and service point of view, Goldstruck is not up to par.   Hygiene: The bar is lacking in cleanliness; coffee grounds are spread everywhere, the milk pitchers are covered in scale and grime, employees are using their phones, debit machine, handing cash, and then continuing to make beverages without any hand sanitization between.   Service: The employee who served me at the cash was quite nice and clearly put effort into interacting with the customer. The barista who served me however really through off the entire experience. He was very clearly distracted and lacking any drive to work. Upon asking what coffee he served me he answered \"flat white\" and stepped to the side to do something else. There was a miscommunication as I was wanting to know which beans. When I clarified what I was asking he answered \"um, our own special roast\" while walking away to do something else.  When a customer asked about the Hario v60 drip brewer, the employees very clearly had little knowledge about the brewer, and offered an apathetic response similar to that of when I asked about the coffee.  Both employees sat down to play on their phones for 5-10 minutes despite the dirty dish waiting on another table in clear view.  Coffee: flat white was rich and creamy, however lacked in any nuance from the espresso. Milk texture was quite nice and overall it was a reasonably good beverage. It was unfortunately under filled by about 2 millimetres.  Overall, this shop is acceptable for takeout coffee for someone that appreciates a decent beverage. I would not recommend this shop by any means if you are an experienced coffee consumer with interest in the product. This shop very clearly does not strive for excellency and by no means offers anything to the specialty coffee scene. For the price and availability, there are shops in Toronto that are making waves in the rapid innovation of coffee service, while offering amazing genuine service and unique, delicious coffee.   Please note that this is a single experience and only one drink was ordered."}
{"text":"This place is super charming!  Located below a bunch of \"Yorkville\" shops. This long hallway of-a-coffee shop is cozy, industrial and unpretentious like its neighbourhood. They specialize in creative espressos with their fancy machines and it's not just the hype. They serve up some sexy drinks. I had a very memorable Halva Latte. I know halva as a nutty, grainy, super sweet pudding - the Indian version. So I was curious to see how it would play into a latte.   After speaking to the super delightful barista that schooled me on this drink, I was sold! It's one of their signature drinks that blends together two shots of espresso, honey halva and organic steamed milk. It was frothy, rich, nutty and definitely a treat.   Definitely going back there again! This time to work and to overdose on coffee."}
{"text":"Ok coffee and cute place but not coming back. The service wasn't great or friendly and the coffee was ok but not special."}
