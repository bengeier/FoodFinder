{"text":"The quality and order accuracy varies so much its no longer worth it.  Used to love this place but the last several orders have been more than disappointing.  Usually get delivery through Order it, they rarely get it right even though its typed out for them to read.  The owners have attitude problems and its evident as the staff turnover is so high, no wonder there is no consistency in quality.

Save your money, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I liked the food here, not a busy place. I ordered a beef burrito, 2 pulled pork hard tacos and a chicken quesadilla. I had ordered the beef in the past and wanted to try something different - preferred the beef to the chicken for sure. The tacos were surprisingly good - I was used to eating tacos at a mexican place in downtown Portchester NY - this reminded me of those days. The pork was very nice and tender. The burrito on the other hand had too much filling - I could not finish all of it. Will be going back."}
{"text":"My  1st. visit to this mock Tex-Mex bistro did nothing to give me confidence that I was going to enjoy the food ...
My date ordered the Brisket and I selected the Pulled Pork and Rib combination...with Beers to cheer our mood. 
The atmosphere was sparse with earth tones abounding everywhere..even the chairs...I wondered how the cleansing process happened if you couldn't spot that elusive dried gravy spot on the table.  
The meals arrived tepid...the Brisket was chewy, with the attached beans and slaw served in small ceramic dishes , resembling the urine sample containers at the Doctor's office....
My ribs were seasoned , but not meaty...I gnawed on the bone to salvage what nourishment I could. 
The Pulled Pork resembled a disassembled hawser...and stringy as the last pair of a Huskie's halter.
I had lived in Texas, Oklahoma and Arizona....but the food resembled nothing that I had eaten in my feisty younger days.  The prophecy of popping some Zantac came true...and we skipped dessert.  
My wallet was thinner by $65.00 including a tip."}
{"text":"I'm sad to see mediocre reviews of this restaurant. Yes, it's not as crowded as downtown Toronto's popular \"Burrito Boyz.\" And yes, the service may not be all that; but one still needs to give this place a chance. For one, the large burritos are HUGE. As a vegetarian, I have to say the soy burritos are probably the BEST in the city (THIS PLACE IS A MUST TRY FOR VEGETARIANS). And for my lovers of spice, ask to get your burrito extra spicy: this place makes their own hot sauce (which they have been reluctant to sell to me by the bottle), which is one of the hottest EVER."}
{"text":"I happened to drive by Barburrito one night and decided to fill my hungry stomach with some yummy burritos. I went in and ordered a fish burrito and my friend ordered a trio of tacos.  The server proceeded with taking our orders but he didn't seem to be very fluent in English. We had to repeat a few things several times.

After about 10 mins wait, the food finally arrived. My Burrito came out hot and toasted which was good, but I was very disappointed very soon after that. There were several problems with the burrito. One, the ingredient is mediocore at best. The salsa wasn't well seasoned, the refried beans has no favor, nor the rice.  The fish that I ordered was very small in size and has no fish flavor.  It tasted like some lettuce, tomatoes with flavorless rice and beans put together in a wrap.  One bite I tasted mushy flavorless refried beans, another bite, dry and tastless lettuce.  It was so bad it left me unsatifised. The portion is great but it lacks serious flavor.  

My friend's tacos were worse. The taco shell looked just like the ones you buy at grocery stores.  Yellow-ish, dried, hard tacos. The lettuce was all over the place and sour cream was placed right on top of the lettuce instead of with the meat. Seriously, it looked worse than taco bell.  My friend also complained that it was very salty.  A probably sign of hiding stale, unfresh meat that has been sitting in the counter for the whole day.

The total came to 18 dollars including a drink.  I think I could get a much satifying meal at taco bell for much less.  Parking is also a problem in the area.

I hope that the owner read this and rethink how they run their business. There is no passion in the food they produce and you can tell they absolutely have no clue on what it takes to run a good burrito joint. I have had great burritos at Burritos Boys in Downtown and Mucho Burrito in the past. This place pales in comparison and frankly they should close it down."}
{"text":"I ordered a large steak burrito and they barely put any steak and the guacamole is an extra dollar. Why? didn't taste too goof either. The steak needs more flavor. I wouldn't try it again"}
{"text":"Passable food; too bad about all the styrofoam packaging!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Bland meat, terrible salsa (I think that it's just store bought jarred crap), no fresh pico de gallo. 

Do yourself a favour, don't go here."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Not as tasty as the downtown spots like Boyz and Banditos, nor as vibrant. But they're the only burrito place in the area.

For best service, phone ahead for pick-up."}
{"text":"I dropped by with some co-workers one evening and I tried their promo for the pulled pork burrito. I got corn and some veggies added and an Iced Tea to drink.  I don't know how much it costs because it was a group purchase but the food was alright. I don't see myself going out of my way to go back there because personally I'm not the biggest burrito fan but if you do enjoy burritos I would tell people to check it out, compare it to other burrito experiences.  It was hot and full of ingredients, a lil messy but I'm a fan of messy food, it's usually the tastiest.  The order took about 10-15 min. to fill, probably because we overloaded them with a group of 8 order.  Nothing about this particular dish jumped out at me or has made me wanna go back.  Perhaps the other dishes are better, I'm not recommending this place but I'm also not going to tell people to stay away."}
{"text":"This is the worst place to go if you're looking for a great burrito, quesadilla, etc. the place seems cold and you get the feeling that you're not welcome. The food is really nothing worth mentioning. Somehow the staff seems always annoyed. Look somewhere else for good Mexican food because you won't find it here."}
{"text":"Pretty unimpressed with it. I went in on a whim because I was in the mood for a burrito and also wanted to \"test\" just how good my favorite place which is just west of Bathurst & Sheppard is. The food wasn't bad by any stretch but it felt like a step step down even from the major burrito chains (like the Boyz). 
It all tasted just not super fresh...I dunno how to describe it.
Good on them for having beer available though! Gotta love that.
And what was also good to see/taste was their spicy is actual spicy...not Frank's Red Hot \"spicy\""}
{"text":"I rarely buy food for lunch during the work week. Bringing my own food is healthier and less expensive. However, there are those days when I am craving some outside food, and last week, I was CRAVING for a heavy, carby, burrito. I am not the right person to go to for advice on the city's \"best burrito's.\" In fact, I don't think I have ever been to a place for burrito's before...except this place 2 minutes from my work.

By the time I entered, it was empty (2-ish) and I was intimidated because the guy was just waiting for my order. I quickly ordered a regular Chicken burrito with mild spicy sauce. I added a coke and the whole thing came out to be $9 and change which I thought was kind of pricy. But, the burrito was hefty...the kind where you could seriously injure someone if you hurled this carb-haven rock.

I was extremely hungry and back at the office, I was in my own little world as I bit into warm sauce, beans, lettuce, tomatos and chicken all-in-one-bite. I promised myself to eat only half and save the other for dinner, but I managed to devour the whole thing. I definitely felt full after. In the end, this burrito satisfied my hunger for the rest of the day, so I guess my 10 bucks was worth it (two meals). 

Seating is quite ample and there is an outdoor patio."}
{"text":"I don't normally post often but this place is absolute GARBAGE!!!!! I would give it zero stars if I could - 1 star is already too much. I took out steak quesadilla, and to my chagrin, it was BURNT when I opened the box. I posted a picture to the gallery so everyone can witness their audacity to serve crap.

What wasn't burnt tasted like Taco Bell anyway, but at least I was never served burnt food at Taco Bell. I am obviously fuming because this restaurant has ruined my Sunday evening and they deserve to get shut down for their audacity to serve crap. DO NOT WASTE ANY DOLLARS ON THIS PLACE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awful. A lousy version of Burrito Boyz. Service was terrible and the cheese on the burritos wasn't even melted because they wrapped the burrito the wrong way. All the toppings are hidden behind the counter so you don't know if it is fresh. While the burritos were large enough, they aren't yummy so what is the point."}
{"text":"After a couple of years in California, I've fallen in love with great Mexican food, or even decent Mexican food... but this is not it by any stretch.

I ordered the 3 ground beef tacos and I really must say I was having a hard time remembering if I've ever eaten a more bland and flavorless taco in my life. In my mind I was trying to compare it to Taco Bell (the standard for bad tacos) and Barburrito might even be worse in taste, though larger in size.

I don't think there will ever be any compelling reason for me to ever want to have it again, this wouldn't even pass for hangover food."}
{"text":"This place is simply average in my opinion. Came here around lunch. A regular pulled pork burrito was $7.90 (no guacamole). The service was good too. Taste was average as well."}
{"text":"Being in the neighbourhood for quite some time, i find myself frequenting this place quite often. I feel even though it does not come up to par with the quality of burrito boyz and also fat burrito or chipotle. I feel some of the reviews have been harsh. They have tons of toppings to choose from and their quesadilla is actually very tasty. MAybe because i love to drown my food in hot sauce i find it delicious. They are little on the stingy side when it comes to the amount of meat they put in though."}
{"text":"I was recommended to go here by my work friends and boy am I happy I went! I had the bean and cheese burrito and my boyfriend had the tacos and we both give it a 10/10 in quality I'm so excited I found a great place to come and get a healthy(somewhat) healthy meal. It was so fresh tasting...nom nom nom I wish I could treat it :) I can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Took my teenage son there on a Thursday night at around 8 pm. We drove by it a few times, so thought it might be good to try, since my son likes mexican. well.....i have tried worse, but i definitely won't be back. Nachos supreme were cold, mind you, we were eating in. Burrito's were okay, but no more than that. For the taste it was quite pricey - 6.99. It would help the owner, who was serving us to be a little more careful to the customers, instead of chilling with his friends in the front of the store. I paid debit and never got the receipt, since the clerk that ran through the card turned around and went away as soon as he handed me over the debit machine. overall, it is merely 1 star, and no, I won't be back. It makes sense to drive for Pita Nutsies, where they really make it fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Been to this place about a hundred times. I love their chicken burrito. BUT.... seriously... SERIOUSLY... when are the employees going to learn CUSTOMER SERVICE? This place has THE worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life and this is over the course of 3 years I've been going. I CANNOT stand the guy with the greasy hair and accent who thinks he is the SHIT. Hello, you work at BAR BURRITO, do your job RIGHT! This guy is a joke and bothers me. I get angry when I deal with him."}
{"text":"I think the many negative reviews don't give true credit to this place. To my mind it is way better than most chains, e.g. Taco bell mucho burrito etc mentioned hers. It would lose to some of the  downtown joints like burrito bandidos on Peter st, but i think its the best in North York, as far as burritos go. The meals are huge and have enough taste, tortillas are fresh.. Solid 4 stars from me.."}
{"text":"I give up on this place! I have gotten burritos and other things from this place on several occasions and it's always been sub-par. Bland food, overcooked, sometimes burnt (nachos). As a result, I haven't bothered going or ordering from there in well over a year. Well, today I had a craving for Mexican and since Toronto has a huge lack of Mexican restaurant choices and because I'm busy working at home, my husband and myself decided to order from BarBurrito's delivery. I should also mention that if you go to justeat.ca BarBurrito charges $7 delivery. Orderit.ca has no charge. Don't know if that's the ordering website or the restaurant, but it's a tip for anyone who decides to order from this place.

So I went ahead and placed the order...only to have it be \"rejected\" by BarBurrito, because they are busy right now. This restaurant is listed on two different food ordering sites, but they won't deliver if they don't feel inclined?? SERIOUSLY! 

So I have learned my lesson. Don't give places second, or even third chances. And this place...don't even give it a first chance. Not worth it at ALL."}
{"text":"$8.50 for a large ground beef burrito. Nothing really surprising. Nothing really different. Not much in the mission-style burrito thing going on in the strip between Sheppard and Finch. If you're hankering a burrito and don't want to travel downtown, this seems to be your only choice. 

There's a nice cozy patio to enjoy your eats. That's about its only stand out feature."}
{"text":"I'm glad to see I wasn't the only one who thought their food literally sucks.

I've had tastier fare at *gasp* Taco Bell!! At least you can use their sauce to make things taste better..here you have nothing to help you save your meal.

Too pricey, tasted stale, and the \"extreme' fries really leave a lot to your imagination! Save your money, try finding mexican elsewhere. This just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"Had the steak burrito.  It was OK.  Nothing to write home about, but if you're in the neighborhood and want a burrito, go for it."}
{"text":"This place is pretty average. Was in the area for training and needed to grab food, so decided to go with a burrito bowl. There are a surprisingly large number of staff there, but only two of them are doing any work. 

Servings/Scoops are small (had to keep asking to get about a total of 1 tbsp of tomatoes) and they definitely give larger servings and preferential service to the high school crowd (that probably make up a very large portion of their sales). 

There's a small sitting area, but it is a purely by necessity kind of place."}
{"text":"Burritos made to order so during lunch peak hour, expect to wait about 5-8 minutes. That said, the ingredients don't taste super fresh. They were simply okay. Prices are about $6 for specials or $8 for regular sized burrito. Service wasn't exactly friendly or welcoming which is kind of sad. Burrito tasted okay, was a bit messy due to juices from salsa leaking out and taste was fine but not delicous."}
{"text":"For some reason I decided to try and do a Paleo Whole30 challenge right before my monthly trip to Toronto.  If you've never heard of it, google it.  

Basically it means you can't have anything with added sugar, most oils, butter, grain, legumes, dairy, etc., etc.  So wtf was I going to eat?

Enter BarBurrito.  It's kind of like a lesser step-cousin of Chipotle.  Definitely not up to that standard, but the options of meat and vegetables with guacamole and salsa fit the paleo bill close enough.

The woman gave me a strange look when I requested a naked burrito without rice, beans, cheese, sauce, or sour cream.  I think she did give me extra meat though, so there's always that.

It was actually pretty tasty despite leaving out all the accouterments and topping with some salsa verde."}
{"text":"Pros:
Uniformed worker was great

Cons:
Owner/supervisor(?) wasn't as much.

I almost want to write two separate reviews for this place.  One for the uniformed worker here and another for who I am assuming is the owner or at least supervisor.  The food is here typical for what you would find at your typical Mexican fast food eatery.  It's not the the best you can do, but it will get the job done if you're craving a burrito.

I want to praise whoever the uniformed worker was here.  She was very nice and polite too all the customers she served.  When I got in, it was just her by herself with a lineup of about 4 people before me.  She tried her best to keep the line going but being by herself, it was tough.   She didn't rush making the burritos though, she put the effort in to make sure they were made well.  She kept looking back outside as if she was looking for someone.  

All of a sudden, a lady who looked like she was dressed to go clubbing walks in and gets behind the desk,  She mumbles a quick sorry to the worker and gets the next customer. She, does not have the same service as the worker.  She slaps things together as quick as she can with not much care.  Her tone with the customers wasn't much better.  It felt like she just wanted to get out as soon as possible to go out.  This lady had to be at least a supervisor or could very well be the owner.  It shows a lot about the business when the person in charge sets this kind of example.  I'm happy it didn't rub off on the other staff here.

Again, if you're craving a burrito, this place should suffice.  I think Burrito Boyz up the street is a better option though.  If you come though, and see a lady not in uniform and looking more ready to club, avoid her if you can."}
{"text":"Average,  but doesn't hurt to get a burrito here if you're looking for something quick and dirty."}
{"text":"Just finished choking down my questionable Barburrito, so I thought I would leave a little review in case I don't make it to tomorrow. 

What an interesting type of chicken they use. Vegan friendly, too! It's one part foam, one part water, two parts PVA glue. 

The kibble Barburrito uses for beef was an interesting choice as well. I usually prefer Fancy Feast when i'm going to eat cat food. But that's okay. 

In terms of low quality...this place truly reigns supreme. It looks the same coming out as it does going in. 

Good luck everyone! :)"}
{"text":"I tried their steak burrito yesterday and it was just ok... Can not really complain about the food, but it did not taste the way that a good burrito should taste... Do not forget to add the Guacamole  to ur burrito if u stopped by this place"}
{"text":"Pretty good joint. I got the chicken and steak buritto and some extreme fries. Although the fries didn't seem super fresh, the buritto was very fresh and flavourful.. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Average burrito -- pricey, but a great size, even for 'regular'.  Although it's made 'fresh' for some reason it always tastes a bit on the soggy and oily side. There are other items on the menu including tacos and quessadillas, but not much else.  Takes quite a while to get your order as well. Gets an extra star for being a rare burrito joint in the area."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!! They kicked us out in the middle of eating saying they had to close right on the dot and weren't willing to let us finish our food. The crazy Middle eastern woman was so rude and disrespectful we couldn't believe how bad she was in customer service. After we ordered our food and sat down she yelled at the guy who made our food for letting us in saying it was too close to closing but we actually had 20 mins. She was just too lazy to stay a second longer. Food was also blahhh .. Tasted old and leftover ... NEVER going back and wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you want to be yelled at!"}
{"text":"Like other reviews have stated, service is not particularly friendly but the burrito was quite delicious. Had the large Chorizo and it was tastier then the Mucho Burrito's that I've had in multiple occasions. I will visit again."}
