{"text":"Similar to my review of Jonathan's... Where this place hasn't changed in 20 years. Food is great actually, but I find myself looking for newer places that are hip.  Oliver's reminds me a lot of Sears Canada, they are trying to hold onto a dying customer and guess what, Target just moved into town. If Oliver's doesn't adapt quickly, they will continue to have just the 5 front of the restaurant tables filled for dinner service only. \"Wake up, Maluca just opened across the street and it is the place that the younger crowd is going too. Why not re-do the front of your restaurant to be a Bistro Bar and move the dinning towards your ever empty back part of your restaurant?  Great food, but when you are done with dinner, my apr√®s drinks are not being poured by this restaurant. Oliver's don't become Sears Canada...your existing customers are dying off and so will you if you don't change with the dynamics of the younger downtown crowds who now have money to spend."}
{"text":"We went out on our anniversary, a perfect choice for the occasion, bit too formal for my taste. The place has a nice character and good service"}
{"text":"It's been twenty years since last going there, and the decor was then and still is now dated. I find restaurants without carpet a tad noisy for my hearing. However there is no deny that the food is good.  I like that they will accomodate changes to the set menu. I always prefer rissotto with my steak. I also like my steak a little more than medium rare, and it was. The waiter seemed a little nervous, maybe he was new.  It was Friday night and was not busy, which was a suprise. I dont mind paying top dollar but left thinking it was hard to justify the cost. Dinner to two, two glasses of wine, one liquer, two appertizers, two main courses, no desert or coffee etc - $190.00"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend for dinner here for his birthday. The service was great and certainly a 5 star. Nothing we tried we didn't love. We shared the escargot app which was my first time trying it and really enjoyed it. I had a steak and lobster tail, both were cooked perfectly. My boyfriend had the rack of lamb which he said was amazing. Will be going back for a special occasion for sure. It isn't cheap so expect to spend at least $200 if you want any booze as well."}
{"text":"Food is simply divine! It's been awhile since eating here, but one of the best meals I have ever had was at Oliver's in Oakville."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 4.5 out of 5. Great steakhouse and one of the better steaks I get in all GTA. Their sister restaurant in Burlington (carriage house) is a tad better as the atmosphere is nicer and they use mesquite BBQ."}
{"text":"Great restaurant from the moment you walk in. Great service and attention with regular visits, but not too many. The menu is a comprehensive list of everything you'd want from a top steakhouse. Can vouch for the lamb: extremely great.  This is a destination that you want for business, personal or pleasure. The team is very accommodating and management has a clear focus on the customer. Definitely stop here when in Oakville!"}
{"text":"Olivers is not just about steak, though if you want melt in your mouth tenderloin, this is where to go. Seafood and fish are always exceptional.   So glad the original charm has been maintained. I hope we can count on that in the days to come.   For those who know how to appreciate fine dining, eloquent service, and a great evening out, it's the place to go in Oakville."}
