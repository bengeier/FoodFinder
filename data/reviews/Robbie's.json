{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service. The name of the place is actually Robbies smokehouse and burger bar. If you like smoked meats they have a variety of choices like smoked chicken, brisket, prime rib, pulled pork and more! The head chef has a great reputation in the city and is often employeed to do openings fornew restaurants Canada wide. He is recognized for being innovative and extremely passionate with food. 5 stars for Robbies located right next to playground poker club"}

{"text":"I've heard some good things about this place sad that I can't fully agree with others.

Upon arrival the hostess tells us we need to check in our coats at coat check because there's no space left. Once we get seated at the table we notice that everyone else has their coats on their chairs. There were even hooks at the back to hang your things,so not sure why we were obliged to check in our jackets.

We started with steak nachos,beef wrapped in bacon, cheese sausage dip and a clam chowder soup. The entrees were DELICIOUS! So much flavour, not overly salty and the clam chowder had actual chunks of seafood pieces.

We ordered 2 bottles of wine averagely priced, a cocktail called Khaleesi (taste just like a mojito with less mint).

Once the main course arrived that's when things went from delicious to mediocre. Lobster was good, the 911 burger with 4 patties was very dry, not spicy (they use Franks red hot sauce). My Go big burger was good but very very oily, I had to dab it with a napkin. Steaks were average. We asked for medium well they gave us medium, it was too bloody for the person. 

Good service,waiter was very attentive asked if we were celebrating anything,he brought a cake with a candle bc it was someone's birthday.

Overall it was ok,really good starts main course is meh. Not sure if I would comeback.

Pros: ITS TAX FREE!!"}
{"text":"Interesting story; we met the owner and his finance of Robbie's Smokehouse on vacation in Puerto Vallarta.  
As one week vacations go, you make friends but usually never see them again...!

Well, not this time as our visit to Montreal we were able to go and experience this smokehouse restaurant in kawanahke.

The place is nicely decorated with the rugged look of a smokehouse complimented by flatscreens and a full bar.  

We got the;
* Jack burger 5 stars big and tasty meat
* Lunch smokehouse sandwich 4 stars not enough smoky flavor or taste
* Beet salad 4 stars too much red onion not enough beets (suggestion add some yellow and white beets)
* Lunch rib and chicken combo 4 stars ribs were good chicken just ok
* The coleslaw is too vinegary, served in a plastic container (should be switched it to a porcelain cup)
* Fries were good with just amount of seasoning
* If you like red ale beers, get the Ridgeback

Service 5 stars 
Food 4 stars good but room for improvement 
Ambiance 5 stars
Price 5 stars 
Overall experience 5 stars 

Although Chad was not in town the day we stopped by, but we weren't disappointed having lunch there.   Too bad we didn't get to see our friend.  Till next time...

{"text":"Reviews got us excited . Well bad attitude and service is slow and terrible. Order pork rib special
Looked create tasted great .. then cut into centre it was layered in fat.. 2/3 was just fat. See attached picture . The waiter was shown the food and told us that nothing he could do since we ate part of it, the manger told us that he would give us a free desert. When asked to replace it he said no 
Overpriced for the quality and bad service 
Do not waste your time or money better BBQ places in Montreal and Laval . Love Social media where you get the opportunity to share honest feedback"}
