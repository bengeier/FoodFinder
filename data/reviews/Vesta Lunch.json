{"text":"Most of the reviews of Vesta Lunch, the good ones and the bad ones, are right.  It's a 24 hour, seven days a week greasy spoon with all the pluses and minuses such places have.  If you're lucky, however, George Golias will be the cook behind the counter and he's a fascinating fellow, a 73 year old Czech who has been in Canada for forty or so years, speaks, reads and writes ten languages including Japanese, Arabic, Greek, and Russian to name a few.  A one hour documentary movie (The Night Cook) was made about him in 2011 and has aired at least eight times on TV Ontario.  He'll make you a good breakfast and entertain you, if you ask, with stories of his life.  The place is worth a visit if George is there!"}
{"text":"Went there for weekend lunch. Worst hamburger ever, and one of the old cooks had a really bad Oder. To many better places in T.O. to ever go back."}
{"text":"This place is frozen in time. Even though I've never lived within walking distance, I've been here more times than I'd like to admit, at all hours of the night, generally involving a request to the cabbie for a drop off half way home.  And they don't judge, they're just there to serve you food is hearty, quick and cheap."}
{"text":"The Good:  1. Cool looking place it reminds me of a old school dinner out of the states.  2. Great Asian Chef working mostly in the nights who takes pride in his work  3. Friendly people and atmosphere   The Bad:   1. Out dated paying methods; you pay either cash or use their ATM to withdrawal.  2. Not the cleanest place I been too, i noticed it has a weird odour as your sitting waiting for your food.  3. Not the cleanest bathrooms  4. There is a older white male as a chef in there  who is in his 50's and does NOT look clean at all. Numerous times I've been there and seen him deal with meat,fish, eggs and touch other foods which leads to cross contamination and which is unacceptable. Im surprised that he still even works here for that long after all the complaints I heard from customers and employees.   The Truth   Its just a place to swing by and get some fast food and pray that you don't get sick. Its also a nice drunk spot after a night out and you need some type of food in your system. Not a place i recommend on a first date!"}
{"text":"Like the guy said when I came here, \"Our place is only seven feet wide, but our menu is thirteen feet long!\" Vesta Lunch is a fantastic counter-style diner that's been around for over sixty years, is open twenty-four hours, and is staffed by real characters.  You can come for steak & eggs, burgers, souvlaki, and, of course, banter--in other words, all the hallmarks of a classic greasy spoon. If you want to get the delicious breakfast special, don't show up too late: the price goes up after 11 AM. It's served lighting-fast, although if you're not assertive, you might not get much input into how the eggs are done."}
{"text":"I think this may be somewhere that needs a star rating for drunk and sober experiences because I'm sure I would have enjoyed it much more had I been too drunk to regret wasting calories on greasy food that doesn't even taste that great.  The atmosphere has a really cool old diner feel.  There is just one long counter with stools, behind which the chef prepares your meal.  I was served by a nice older gentleman who made friendly conversation with us while we waited.  It is definitely not fancy or even very nice but it has a great old fashioned vibe that I really liked.  My food wasn't great.  I had fish and chips and both were clearly right out of a package and fried.  Also the fries were floppy and barely brown which is not my cup of tea. It was served with coleslaw and two little packets of tartar sauce.  At 8 bucks I guess it is an ok deal.  My boyfriend had the liver special.  It was swimming in gravy but apparently satisfying.    So I think this is a great place to check out for historical value and the nice staff but I wouldn't say that the food is anything to seek out.  It also has virtually no vegetarian options which is a little disappointing but not surprising.  You could probably get the BLT without the bacon but that's basically it."}
{"text":"The poutine here is frozen fries, the worst skin-coated gravy in the city, and a kraft single slapped on top. Do not go here. Not even if you are super tanked."}
{"text":"They cut everything on the same cutting board, raw chicken and tomatoes for a salad go on the same board that is simply wiped after use, so you know, don't order anything that doesn't get cooked.   Also they undercook everything, so don't get chicken.   One time I asked for water, and the guy who was cutting raw chicken didn't wash his hands before getting my water, so my glass had raw chicken and marinade juice on it. It was really gross.   Pretty much you can only safely eat eggs, toast, and fries. Everything else, at your own risk.   It survives because it's the only 24 hour restaurant in the area, but if another one opened up nearby it'd be out of business in a week."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years for their all-day breakfast and it's not fancy but they serve an honest bacon and eggs. I was working in the neighborhood this past weekend and with few options in the area on a Sunday afternoon, I popped in. Not in the mood for breakfast that day, I went for the fish and chips. What a mistake! I don't remember the last time I ordered fish and chips in this city and got served a piece of frozen fish. I don't go to \"fish and chip\" places a lot and I don't know if pub fish and chips are typically frozen or not but this place doesn't even try to pretend. It's a straight up rectangular frozen fish patty. And it must have been really frozen because when I cut into it, it was still firm and cold in the middle. The fries were gross and left a brown oil stain on the edge of my plate. I don't know if the fish and chips were different when the original guy ran it but it seems like the man and woman running it now don't really care. I write this as I sit on my toilet with food poisoning for the second night in a row thanks to Vesta Lunch."}
{"text":"Best burger and fries I have ever had after midnight. After a night of partying, don't go to a fast-food place, come here instead."}
{"text":"Here goes: It's unsanitary. I now only order poutine, as the deep frier seems like the most sanitary option. I once ordered a burger and it came cold in the middle, you have to specify well done, and even then I wouldn't have much faith.   When I get poutine, I ask for crispy fries but they don't always succeed in fulfilling that request. The poutine comes with cheddar sandwich slices which while hilariously unauthentic I've become accustomed to and really enjoy now. They also offer a feta cheese poutine, which I'm sure has never been ordered by anyone.   You will only ever visit this place late night and drunk, and it will be full of unsavoury people, yourself included."}

{"text":"Was everything I was hoping for, a perfect greasy spoon diner. Ordered a clubhouse and a milkshake, both were served up very fast by the only cook on staff, mind you it wasn't busy at the time. Decent sized menu fir such a small place too. All around great experience."}
{"text":"This diner has been around as long as I can remember and today I finally decided to try it. They are a 24 hour diner with decent prices and loads of options to choose from. It's very small and you're sitting bar style. I decided to order the steak and eggs and for the price of 13 dollars, it was pretty good. It also comes with toast and home fries. Something about their home fries just tasted better than most places; maybe more pepper?  The service wasn't too great cause I asked for water twice and never got it but I did go in at 2am with half a full restaurant and only 1 server. Beware they only take cash so be prepared."}
{"text":"One of the last authentic old school diners left in Toronto. No tables, just a counter facing the open kitchen, open 24/7. Put on your fedora, pull up a stool, and take a trip back 60 years!  Vesta Lunch - Reputable Since 1955!"}
{"text":"I am usually a fan of dives, greasy spoons, mom 'n pop shops etc, but the food here just isn't good. It isn't even good if you've been drinking. It's really a pity considering I live nearby. To put things into perspective: if there was a fast-food place next door (e.g. Wendys) I would choose to go there over Vesta lunch despite in theory wanting to support local businesses."}
{"text":"This place is a godsend on the long trek home after a night of drinking. Let's be clear, I would not go here if it weren't on the way. But because it's on the way home and open 24 hours a day, I find myself squeezed into the tiny place every couple of weeks.  The food itself is not great. It's greasy diner food. I always order the liver and onions, and it's always fine... crispy fries, great dairy-free out-of-the-box gravy. The fact of the matter is, I'm usually so drunk by the time I get there that anything I eat tastes delicious. The husband always gets a BLT, which he seems pretty satisfied by every time.  The service is friendly, jokey and great. I honestly don't know how people manage to be nice to drunks, but I guess we're their bread and butter.  It's a great place for post-boozedown eats, people watching and overhearing dumb college students' drunken ramblings about life."}
{"text":"I live nearby and have wanted to try this place foreva-eva, however it looks so grimey that I needed some good excuse to go in.  Welcome statutory holiday an 24 hour diner a few blocks from my crib.  Went there at the wee hours of the morning yesterday knowing only that I was starving and not ready to spend a lot on food.  Being a semi-part-time-vegetarian there was not much option for me (predictable) however my friend got a deluxe burger (which comes with fries) and I upgraded it to greek style poutine and just ate that. We also got a chocolate milkshake which we devoured.   The food was okay-pretty much what you would expect, but the service was great. They were very kind and being the middle of the night, it was pretty fast, as well.   Not bad for a 24 hour nearby greasy spoon."}
{"text":"There is nothing high brow about this place.  There are hardly any seats, and often you have to sit beside some obnoxious drunk guy, who is too loud, invading your personal space and is hitting on your best friend. But that's all a part of the charm of this 24 hour diner at the corner of Bathurst and Dupont.   For the longest time, I use to drive-by this place on my way home, when I lived in North York and I was always curious as to how greasy their spoons were. Well when I finally stopped in, I wasn't disappointed.   My staple is to order a grilled cheese sandwich with bacon. The bacon isn't on the side, it's actually a part of the sandwich. delicious. I don't make a habit of coming here, but if it's late night, and I'm passing by, you may catch me enjoying a sandwich here."}
{"text":"This 5-star rating is based solely upon how fantastic Vesta Lunch is for a hangover on a late Saturday afternoon following a staff party where too many alcoholic beverages were consumed the previous night.  With that clearly out of the way, one has to give Vesta kudos for both its longevity (est. 1955), the sheer volume of its eclectic menu, its price point and the hours of operation cannot be beat.  With a waning 24 hour diner scene in the city, Vesta is a welcome sight at 3:30am or whatever other ungodly hour one deems fit to enjoy authentic Souvalaki and a milkshake.  With an all-day breakfast and light speed service  thrown into the mix, Vesta is worthy competition for even the greasiest of spoons."}
{"text":"Vesta Lunch is purportedly an iconic institution of Toronto. I'd suggest that has much more to do with the highly visible location on the northeast corner of Dupont and Bathurst, and its Hopper-esque appearance, than with the quality of its food. Anything I've eaten here has been bland and covered with a thin layer of grease. I'd go for the coffee, if I was waiting for the Dupont bus that stops outside, but that's it."}
{"text":"I love a good diner so I decided to visit one. There's just something about a diner that, despite the shapes and sizes they come in, feel something like home.   // Diner Dash: Sunny Side Up //  I went to check out Vesta one evening. With just one bar and a row of stools to accompany it, It has to be the smallest diner I've ever been in.   I was greeted by the lady you see in my photo and ordered some breakfast. My eggs are usually scrambled, but I decided to get them Sunny Side Up.   The food was good and as I was about to take my last bite, the lady asked me how the meal was. We started talking about diners and why the food sometimes feels like home. Back in the 70s, the lady was just a little girl entering Vesta with her 6 siblings and father. They just arrived in Canada and Vesta was becoming their morning routine. She remembered how her father would proudly tell others that the 7 kids were his and it was there that she had eggs for the first time as breakfast. It just wasn't a breakfast item where she was from.   When she explained how later she would call back home to her father to tell him that she now worked at this tiny diner, there was so much heart found in her voice. Her father, Canada as her new home and eggs for breakfast all become rooted in Vesta. The lady hopes to continue cooking there for a long time.   I smiled back, told her I hope she can too, and took the last bite of my eggs. They really did taste Sunny Side Up."}
{"text":"Old school diner in a great way! Simple good food in fair prices. Service is okay but don't expect much of a conversation or a smile (which is perfectly fine!). I just love this place"}
{"text":"Wow, here is a place I haven't thought of or been to in years.  Unless it has changed, my memories are of a true, retro diner--that isn't actually trying to be retro.  I ate here twice.  The food is basic of course.  And inexpensive.  There are always characters and the like having a meal here.  It is a real greasy spoon.    I can't really complain...no, I can.  I remember why I didn't eat here again.  I got sick.  But that was a long time ago.  I'd go back.  I now live pretty far away and have similar places along the Danforth.  Sit at the counter for the real experience!  Recommended if you are in the area or working on some check list of \"Toronto greasy spoons to try\"."}
{"text":"Its a small diner with very little room.  Its open 24 hours, and if you're are looking a place to eat where you can good value for your dollar, Vesta is a great place to go.  The food is very hardy and simple (better value than going to a harveys.)    However I would like to highlight something on their menu that is tops, its the 'house fries' they have.  Its actually chopped potato mash, that are cooked on top of the flat grill, and its given a sprinkling of salt, pepper, sweet paprika (and will never find its way into the frier.)  Wish other places did this.  Anyways, the food is simple, filling, and perfect for those people who are hungry after hitting the clubs/bars, and they don't over charge you.  Don't expect anything gourmet, its a greasy spoon that serves comfort food for those who are hungry at 3am."}
{"text":"Really awesome diner style restaurant with all counter no tables or booths, very retro feel and good vibes all around, greasy spoon type diner, cute date place to share a burger or milkshake, the chicken fingers were great and the fries were amazing! Service was very quick and friendly, it is cash only though just as an FYI, there is an ATM located in the downstairs part of the restaurant. Slightly pricey for diner food but a great experience nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Vesta Lunch On Wheels - the food truck  Korean fusion Canadian food was the theme of the day for the truck. I got the bulgogi poutine. For $10 it was a large serving almost ate the whole thing but was really full & it was delicious - covered in LOTS of gravy the way I like it. They didn't skimp on the beef and kimchi - which added sweet and spicy flavours. It's everything you want a greasy poutine to be and it just hits the spot with an asian spin - I would definitely get it again! Their regular burger was $8.00 and was solid food truck burger no complaints. The older asian man serving was very nice as well"}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  All i know is that this is the best place to go for food after some drinks...sorry i mean a lot of drinks hahaha  food was decent but that's what you get for late but the friendly staff makes this place a must go if you are in the area.  Next time you go tell \"Momma\" Chris says hi.  she is the one that wears the little cute black hat.   Go with the breakfast special or chicken club with fries."}
{"text":"One of the few, and probably last, truly 24-hour greasyspoon diners in the city, and still with the same formica counter that graced the place when your grandfather had his morning coffee there.  It's not classy but it's classic, not cuisine but it has character.  And when you're hammered at 3am, there's nothing quite like a plate of hot eggs, toast, and coffee under fluorescent lighting to wake you up pleasantly."}
{"text":"REPUTABLE SINCE 1955. Reading their ridiculous sign, I'm overjoyed with this place before I even walk in. What I walk into suits me just fine--the long bar that extends in front of me makes up the entirety of the dining space, and wafting in the air is the faint smell of my grandparent's kitchen (cooking grease and formica--mmmm).  Two orders of eggs, bacon, potatoes toast and coffee plus a chocolate shake to share are ordered.  The breakfast potatoes were AMAZING.  The scrambled eggs were 30% butter, which, as it turns out, is amazing. If this frightens you, have your eggs fried. My DP's were fried to perfection. Bacon was acceptable.  Coffee was good, and refilled promptly.  Choc shake was I think made chocolate with syrup (don't quote me on this), but it was served with one of those great tins that holds everything that won't fit in the glass, which made up for it.   Service was perfect.   Everything was absolutely classic except the Sirracha sauce offered-- and I'm fully willing to sacrifice theme for Sirracha.   This experience came in at $22. Get your tush onto one of these stools, man."}
{"text":"I live only 5 minutes walking to get here, but never really get a chance to try it. Then yesterday they opened a one of the stand on the busker fest at yonge-dundas. I thought that why don't give it a try, i bought their pork souvlaki dinner for $9. I thought that they would give me a generous portion with roasted potatoes, etc ( like most of the souvlaki has ) but all i got was a rice, little amount of pork and lettuce.. I think it's ok if the taste was good, but it was really bland!  I was totally devastated and it wasn't worth at all!! No doubt there wasn't many people buy from them. There's a lot of different greek restaurant that offers better souvlaki than them."}
{"text":"All I wanted was a poutine, and it was really, really sad. I don't expect much from a greasy spoon, but decent fries at least! Better to go up the street to the Annex Grill."}
{"text":"I want to hate Vesta Lunch given the quality of their greasy food, but its so cheap and its close proximity to where I live keeps me coming back. Mind you I don't think I have ever been to this place earlier than 3:00am and I have definitely never been when sober.  It's down the road from me so if I am walking past on my way home from a night out then it seems like a good idea, but it usually isn't. I tend to order things like sloppy burgers with homefries and it always tastes like the most amazing food given my state, but in reality I know it's probably not. The homefries tend to be undercooked and this concerns me when it comes to eating anything meat-based. But at least it's cheap and all the drunks sitting along the tiny counter are likely thinking the same thing.  The place is absolutely tiny. You walk in and hope it's not crowded because I can't imagine what it would be like when things are standing room only. I imagine you would have to wait outside for your order. I recommend getting take-out because you really don't want to spend more time in here than you have to. Plus the food will likely look less appetizing under bright lights. There's been some instances where I have been waiting for food and I have to entertain drunken knuckleheads, but if you're cool with the staff/cooks then they will have your back in a second if things get out of line."}
{"text":"If Edward Hopper lived in Toronto and decided to paint his famous painting \"Nighthawks\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nighthawks) in Toronto, you'd see a few people at the counter and a cook making cheeseburgers in front of the grill at Vesta Lunch while traffic slid by in the night along Dupont.  This is as diner-y as you can get.  Forget the faux quaintness of the Fran's franchise (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/frans-restaurant-toronto), this is the greasy spoon of all greasy spoons.  It's a shoebox of a place that has possibly four to five tables, and a counter that runs the length of the restaurant with stools for singles to sit, eat, and not bother to hang around long.  You go in, you eat, you leave, and are able to do so, 24 hours a day.  The clientele will run the gamut from locals looking for a quick bite, those of a \"harder\" ilk, looking for a cheap lunch, and those that are hammered from a night of drinking looking for something to put in their bellies at 3:00am.  All of this does not take away from the fact that as diner food goes, this stuff is really good.  Never had a bad meal here, but since they've been slinging hash since 1955, you'd assume they've got it right by now.  The interior may not be for everyone or even first-date-friendly, but this place more than serves a necessary purpose.  You're able to get good food quick and cheap.  And not just lunch, as you may infer by the name."}
{"text":"I feel like we all know the sign. We've past it hundreds of times and up until the other day I never even thought about stepping inside to see what type of food they serve. I ended up going in because I was waiting for a store in the area to open at 12.  It's a greasy spoon in every sense of the word. You don't come here for a gourmet dining experience or even a night out with friends. It's only limited counter seating and everything is made before your eyes. The menu has a fair selection of greasy spoon favourites; you know, sandwiches, breakfasts, souvlaki, etc. and everything is done well. I had a sandwich was toasted to a perfect golden brown. I will admit the accompanying fries had a bit of a strange taste but they were still easily finished. I believe my meal was supposed to come with coleslaw which was replaced by a tomato slice, but I really wasn't looking forward to the coleslaw anyway.  Service is prompt and despite sitting at the counter, they are fantastic about not hovering over you. Price point is reasonable. It's ideal comfort food served in a relaxed setting. I will be returning to this location in the future."}
{"text":"I really can't help but laugh at the motto... \"Reputable Since 1955\".  Notice it's not saying it was established in 1955 - but seems to suggest some 'irreputable' in the early 50's at least.  So it's a 24-hour greasy spoon that's set up like a narrow bar.  Really just a perfect place to get a cheap, filling, greasy breakfast.  Alongside your usual eggs and meat offerings, there are burgers, pork chop dinner and liver and onions.  I like that it authentic - this place could easily be owned/run/patronized by hipsters - but it's not.  Not the cleanest, best tasting or even cheapest place around.  But the kind of place that makes me happy that it still exists."}
{"text":"Surprisingly awesome! I happend in this place bc I got dropped off in the area 30 minutes before the buses started running...they are open 24 hrs and it was freezing outside. Hence I ran in!   Much to my surprise...it was great! Obviously not gourmet, or fancy, or modern, or large (how did I rate this a 4 star lol?!) BUT if you go in knowing that it's an urban diner/24hr cafe...it's great!   The saff is really friendly! But keep to themselves (I imagine they get quite a few drunken characters!) But at 530 am you can dine with the finest construction men in the city. Lol. It's a greasy and wonderful breakfast (think ulster fry status) and the coffee surprisingly good!   If it's any 'randomly early/late' hour and you're in the area cold, hungry, drunk etc...worth the stop!"}
{"text":"I finally had my first visit to this Toronto fixture a couple of weeks ago.  So greasy... Might I recommend only trying it if you've had a considerable amount to drink first. You can tell at a glance that this place has been around forever, but they've had a long time to perfect service and it gets the job done. Menu and one long low counter with seating run the full length of the place. A TV in the corner keeps you informed of the news, and staff are happy to chat while you wait (not long) for your meal.  I had the gyros breakfast on this visit and enjoyed it, but kept looking over at my vesta-companion's meal of liver and onions - it looked kinda good - not what I would have expected of liver and onions at all.  Open 24-hours, I have to assume they get most of their business during the hours that most other places are closed. Still, not bad."}
{"text":"Turns out you don't need a machine to go back in time. Step into Vesta Lunch and you'll find yourself right back in the 1950's when this Greek family-owned diner opened. This spot is really a special place and worth a detour - but only if you're someone who gets a kick out of vintage haunts and aren't too fussy about service. Take a seat at the counter (there are no tables) and check out the food options posted above the kitchen. If you are there for breakfast try the Breakfast Special for $5.95: two eggs, bacon or sausage, homefries, toast & a coffee. The owner, an older gentleman, will ask you gruffly what you want (and may make a face if he isn't happy with your order!) before getting to work. Watching him work is quite hypnotising - he's obviously done this a million times. I'm sure this guy could make eggs in his sleep. Check out his portrait as a young man behind the counter - he wasn't smiling back then either! As for the food, it's cheap, it's greasy, it's filling. You really shouldn't expect anything more than that. Stick with the classics and don't try to get fancy - nothing good will come of it. Vesta Lunch is open 24/7 and the patrons there will vary according to the time of day / day of the week. Go for breakfast during the week if you're looking for a genuine experience. You'll share counter space with older local gentlemen, many of whom look like they belong at Vesta Lunch."}
{"text":"At Vesta, you get what you expect.  There's no need to pretend here at Vesta.  It's a mom & pop (without the mom) cash-only 24h diner located on the NE corner of Dupon & Bathurst.  You're don't go to Vesta at 2am expecting gourmet food.  It serves its purpose.  I work in the area, so am only here during lunch hours.  Having said that, the food isn't spectacular.  I come here sober, during daylight hours, sans food beer-goggles.  So my rating is based on comparing Vesta with its surround places around Bathurst, and it falls short.  I tried it out a couple of weeks ago.  Although the menu has primarily Greek items, I opted for the Fish & Chips, which only came with one piece of fish.  The fries were nothing special.  It also came with a serving of salad.  The tartar sauce is given in packet form.  They do have a solid male-only following during the day.  These regulars seem to be in no hurry when dining here.  Since I am not in the area at the wees hours of the day, I won't ever get to experience Vesta in its full glory, but that doesn't bother me."}
{"text":"I liked this place, but I think I was more in love with *the idea* of this place. You know what I mean?   I love me some diners, some burgers, some souvlaki. And this one has a super-cool atmosphere on top of all that, with its long, skinny counter and flourescent lighting. The staff were definiitely interesting and friendly, and twenty-four hour joints always get bonus points with me. Maybe if I went during the wee hours and not the early evening, maybe if it was a post-drinking visit (which is tough, as far as I'm concerned, cuz it feels too far away from most things, at least in the winter), it would have had the magic I was looking for.   My burger was good; I enjoyed myself; the bathroom was a little terrifying; it's close to my friends' house. But no, it didn't change my life."}
{"text":"Blech. As soon as I moved into this neighbourhood, everyone and their mother told me, \"YOU HAVE TO GO TO VESTA LUNCH\". So one day, I finally walked down the street and went there. And never went back.  I guess with this place, you either love it or you hate it. Personally, I didn't like the fact that the place made me claustrophobic. I've been in bigger bathrooms than Vesta Lunch. You have to sit down at the counter and watch them make your food, and watch them pour the pounds of butter and grease into your food....only to come home and realize you smell exactly like the food you just ate because the fried smell is in your hair.  Nope, not for me. My food was so basic, I could have made it myself at home, and I wouldn't have gained 5 pounds from eating it.  Basically if you have more than 2 people with you, you should not come here simply because you will not all fit inside. And if you are a germaphobe, you'll be happy to know that you will be able to see exactly how many times the cook washes his hands. But I firmly believe that ignorance is bliss in this scenario, and the only way to be ignorant and healthy is to abstain from Vesta Lunch at all costs."}
{"text":"Updated review:  Another visit:  this time I walked out without even being served.  SO disappointing after walking all the way there.   NO consistency in this place.  .............................................................  Please don't think me too fickle, but my most recent trip there was good.  The cook was nice and didn't mind my 10 requests for how I specifically wanted my breakfast prepared.  The breakfast was good.  ...........................................  Below is how much I didn't like the servers the last time I was there:   This place has gone DOWNHILL!  In the past, it's been nice for a greasy bacon and egg breakfast - but the hacks working there now just aren't cut out for serving food.  I don't want to insult the rotund woman serving the food - but they need to widen the space behind the counter because she can't walk behind the counter without bouncing off it frequently and knocking things over on the serving counter.  And she is rather clueless as a server.  I didn't get the Coke that I asked for, and no Ketchup for the fries.  No toast.  It sat waiting to be toasted after she asked if I wanted brown bread or white.  And then - when I was done eating, and pushed my plate to the side and wanted to get the cheque - she just kept walking past me and walking past me and ..... ..... .....  And it would be nice if the cook did a little better timing his preparation.  I asked for fries for the second breakfast I ordered (OK - call me a pig) - because I couldn't stomach more than one bite of their pitiful excuse for fried potato mush (I guess they call that crud home fries or something - but it's about the most mushy, soggy, luke warm excuse for such a thing you'll ever see).  I mean that mess was WORSE than your usual crude they reheat to go with bacon and eggs.  But my mistake asking for fries meant that the rest of my food got cold sitting on a plate after the cook took the eggs and bacon off the grill to wait and wait and wait for the fries.  So the eggs and bacon arrive cold.  Thanks.  And the grunge in this place!!!!  Little flies sticking to a sign that hasn't been cleaned in years - and you don't - I mean you DON'T want to see the handle of their frying pan or the block they use to clean off the grill.  Some genius has taken rope of some kind and wrapped it around the handles on those two tools - and the handles are a disgusting grease soaked grungefest.  Someone really should grab a picture of what I'm talking about.  Sorry I didn't get a pic for you.  Because words can't begin to describe the completely grease soaked through dirty rope wrapped around the handles of the tools they use to prepare YOUR food.  There is NO WAY IN THE WORLD those two things could pass a health inspection visit.  No way."}
{"text":"They say customer service is a relic of times past and perhaps the sign outside is indicative of such antiquated practices - but here's a helluva story to renew even the most cynical with faith in mankind:  I wasn't feeling too hot at 11:30 at night after a slight bout of food poisoning a few days prior and had just begun to get my appetite back after eating nothing all day. I wasn't too keen on consuming anything too heavy so I figured I'd call the restaurant which, according to its awning, has had a pretty good reputation for 60 years.  \"Hi there,\" I said as my stomach growled in the background. \"Do you guys have chicken soup?\"  \"Our soup of the day is lentil,\" a kindly female voice replied.   \"Bummer. Well I wasn't feeling very well and was looking for something light to fill me up because I have been ill. Thanks for your time anyway.\"  I was about to hang up when the kindly female voice assured me that she would indeed make chicken soup from scratch and that I should stop by in a half an hour.   Surprised at such magnanimity, I hung up the phone with famished bemusement.  At midnight I walked in and introduced myself.   \"Hello there,\" I said as I extended my hand with gratitude and humility. \"I was the one who called and requested the chicken soup.\"  A slight woman with short grey hair grabbed my hand and with a smile that could warm the heart of someone with the most frigid of demeanors said, \"I'm Miriam and I treated you and made this soup as if you were one of my own children.\"   Needless to say it was the best chicken soup I ever had and when I called her back 20 minutes later after finishing the entire container I told her so.   It was so good in fact and I was so touched by her effort that I said that I was going to sign up for Yelp and write a review because the world needs to know that kindness and culinary expertise are not mutually exclusive.  So I hope you have enjoyed my first official yelp review dear reader. Never has a woman like Miriam or her place of employ - Vesta Lunch deserved it more.  - Fin"}
{"text":"one can only assume why I was at Vesta Lunch 1:30 in the morning...but when you can sit down with four friends, order your meal, and have it served within five minutes, you know you've found a great spot."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for Vesta Lunch: The \"reputable since 1955\" sign always makes me laugh, I find the tiny bar seating space cute, and it is open 24/7. It has a very classic diner feel, so you shouldn't expect anything else from the food. The menu is classic: all-day breakfasts, triple decker sandwiches, entrees like hamburger steak and onions, and milkshakes. Most of these are under $10. I went with my partner at around 9:30pm on a weekday and it was almost empty. The service was great: one guy worked the counter and the kitchen and he was so friendly and cheerful. The club sandwich was exactly as I expected, not amazing, but hit the spot. I wouldn't expect anything else from a diner though! And I will definitely be back."}
