{"text":"Fantastic wine bar with great ambience and service!! Amazing happy hour and reverse happy hour. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Stopped in for lunch and had their cheese board to start and then finished up with the Pesto Chicken Sandwich.  The cheese board had 3 different cheeses, prosciutto, salami, grapes, candied nuts, grilled bread and olives, amazing for $18.  Pesto Chicken Sandwich was delicious as well.  The staff is great and I will definitely be back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun. Perfect service, Marco is a fantastic host. Loved the Mediterranean themed menu and the wine list is amazing. Perfect evening dining outside!"}
{"text":"Tired of hotel lobby bars, this place is percent across the street from a few a marriott properties .. low key, great affordable wine selections and great small plates ... friendly people"}
{"text":"Great food. The meatballs are excellent.  But the service is HORRIBLE. 30 minute ticket time for the meatballs and when we asked for our check it took them 15 minutes... AND MY HUSBAND AND I WERE LITERALLY THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE RESTAURANT.  No exaggeration."}
{"text":"I can't imagine a better experience.  The staff is great, the food was wonderful and they have a great selection of wines!  We will be back many times."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed by this wine bar. If I could give it zero stars I would. I came here on a Thursday night with a couple friends and was appalled by the deplorable customer service we received. We came for the happy hour that was advertised until 7pm, only to find out that it ended at 6pm. That would have been fine until our waiter assured us that he'd honor the happy hour for our first round of drinks and our appetizer. We were even given the happy hour menu to order off of! The bill came at the end of the night and needless to say we were surprised to see that NO discounts were applied whatsoever. We confronted the waiter about this and he brought it back to the manager. This continued on for several more trips back and forth to our table as the manager decided to debate- through our waiter- the accuracy of the happy hour we saw advertised! On a $100 bill they decided to prove a point on a measly $10 happy hour discount. Not to mentioned the entire place was empty on a Thursday night. Piece of advice, Uncorked- think about the big picture when running your business. You've now lost 3 potential weekly customers because of a pathetic $10 error on your part. Good job."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Service, food and wine selections are all fantastic. I'm a wine lover and Allie and Tim knows their stuff. I'm a weekly customer now and it never gets old. I love it. I will recommend this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Visiting the area for the first time. If we lived here we would come every week. Ambiance, wine experience and food are top notch, especially if your looking for a wine bar that isn't fufu or stuffy! Icing on the cake was the staff and especially our server, Ash. She was down to earth, \"real\", made us feel comfortable and was very attentive to our needs!"}
{"text":"Great Place to explore wines. We had three different appetizers and several  (!) wine flights. Once we discovered the wine we liked best, we ordered a bottle.  Service was outstanding and very friendly"}
{"text":"Awesome creative food and it looks like the menu changes periodically.  The owner has a lot of wine knowledge and is willing to help you pick a great glass of wine or recommend a flight of 3 different types.  The two bartenders seemed a little shy but were very attentive and pleasant.  The decor is very nice with colors of various shades of browns and maroons. Lighting is low but not dark, kinda relaxing.  TV over the bar, community table in front of the bar, tall tables, couches for a more intimate setting, regular type 4 top tables, a counter style bar as well.  In addition there is a separate room with another TV. This room looks like it can be closed off for private events or large parties. And there is a pretty large patio with lots of seating. My wife and I were in this past Wed late afternoon, 5 or 6 I think, and there were people on the patio, in the bar and at some of the 4 top tables....nice crowd.  Pricing seems to be inline with other Scottsdale establishments."}
{"text":"Even better than before! Bigger but yet cozy and all the things you missed! :) Love the wine love the people!"}
{"text":"Poor experience on a Sat night for happy hour. Horrible sun glare in front room, without an awning or sunscreen.  Not enough real happy hour specials to keep me ordering or spending more. Only one employee most of our visit, which made wine and food wait times too long."}
{"text":"It's a cute and perfect little place for a fun night with friends or a nice intimate date."}
{"text":"Always trust the Yelp reviews and this one did not disappoint!!

They were fairly quiet when we arrived about 2 pm Saturday afternoon. The several tables that were there you could tell we're regulars, a lot of familiar conversation with the staff.

They were preparing for a monthly wine tasting, but we were not rushed. Loved seeing everyone that came in that appeared to be regulars!

My husband and I each did a wine flight and found a new wine we loved and had never tried before. To eat, I had the KC sliders and the hubs had the Italian sub, both were amazing!!

So happy to find a new place I think we will make a regular \"go to\"!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and we were not disappointed!  Bartender was friendly and gave great beer, wine, and food recommendations. I tasted a couple reds and then decided on a great glass of Niner Red. My husband tasted Oskar Blues Mama's Little Yella Pils and went with a glass of that. It was light and refreshing. My husband ordered Sean's Italian Sub with homemade cole slaw that were both delicious. I had the Uncorked Chopped Salad and ate every bite. We topped it off with the Chef's homemade special dessert...Irish Caramel Cheesecake!  Delish!"}
{"text":"Buyer beware as opposed to customer service focused mentality. 
My husband and I took friends who are relocating to the area here. We had been occasional customers of the previous location and knew they had a decent sparkling wine selection. We were celebrating, after all! 
It was a Saturday afternoon, and was not busy. (Three at the bar, and I think one other table of two) Service speed was pretty slow. 
Two of us ordered sparkling, two of us ordered a wine flight (red and rose). 
When the flights came, the server was quick to share that the 3rd rose should be tasted last because of its intense flavor and the taste would overpower the other wines. She explained it was grapefruit-based. Following the instructions, when arriving at that wine, and taking a sip, it was like squeezing a grapefruit-half into your mouth. When our server came back to check in sometime later, we shared how dissatisfied we were with the third rose and we politely asked if we could try an alternate rose and were told, \"no,\" and \"that's the point of doing flights\" ($18 3 pour flights mind you). First, I've never had a wine flight with a warning/disclaimer on the flight regarding the flavor. Second, if a customer expresses they aren't satisfied after they taste something, offer something else. I hope they dumped the remainder of the bottle after we left (in addition to the full pour left in our table's glass) We won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Poor experience. Much more of a college pub feel than wine bar. I was hoping we would love this place and it could become our bar of choice, but we won't return. We went for a wine tasting night which was supposed to feel special, but it was just strangely pieced together. Trying to find the entrance was confusing because outside they had a \"Coors Light\" branded easel so I thought we were at the wrong place. The owner appeared a bit frazzled, wearing jean shorts, not really connecting with anyone or inviting us back for another time. Tried to introduce ourselves and ask more about the business (initially I was possibly thinking of hosting a future private event there), but got no response really. Mediocre food. We left starving. Water served in beer branded glasses. No fresh wine glasses given throughout the evening which meant throughout the 5 course pairing you had to drink what you had or dump it - otherwise you'd be mixing varieties. Old holiday garland hanging in the private dining room. (It's April.) They barely sold the chosen wine to us at the end of the evening and it was unclear how and to whom we should pay the bill. It was all very disorganized. I got the feeling the vineyard owner who flew down for the night was a bit disappointed with how the evening was handled. The entire place also has a DIY decor feel which i know is their brand but it felt ordinary and thrown together. I did like the sofas though. The wine was great, but when i go to a wine bar i want to feel like it's a special night in some way -- otherwise why not drink wine at home? It doesn't have to be snooty -- their brand is \"the unpretentious wine bar\" which is great -- but it *does* have to feel special. I hope they start adding things up and figuring out they can do better. Just making a few inexpensive changes in the appearance and service would go a long way. (For starters, how about swapping the deli sign out front for a lovely chalkboard, having enough glasses for people, taking down any old holiday decor, and showing some interest in your customers and future business.) if they can up their game we'll give it another try."}
{"text":"This is one of the most unique and romantic wine restaurants for a date night! Perfect candle light illuminates the barn door decore and comfy couches. It's basically like walking out of Scottsdale and into your own little world of Italy. Try the cheese board (18) and flatbreads (11). They are both amazing!!"}
{"text":"Much better location than before. Lots of seating. Easy parking. One of the nicest patios I can think of in the area. I had the big red flight. 2\" of the 3 were OK. The Klinger brink from lodi was my best. Cheese plate generous with the meat. The blue was amaze. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Relaxed atmosphere, friendly, knowledgeable staff, excellent menu offerings (Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheesecake and Crostini Flights!!!), wine superb"}
{"text":"The service was perfunctory. We had the impression the server could care less if we were there or not. Our food was so-so. The mac and cheese was bland, and the soup over seasoned. In spite of this, our wine selections were very nice, and aside from the loud guy at the bar announcing his conquests to all who could hear, the seating was comfortable and ambience quite nice. Just wish the food and service matched the wine."}
{"text":"We always get the chopped salad. It's amazing. The mac and cheese was also fantastic l"}
{"text":"What a fantastic venue! I like the way the different seating options available, high tops, couches with coffee tables, bar seating and traditional tables. I was at this lounge for a fundraising event benefitting The Arizona Pet Project and absolutely love businesses that support the animal welfare organizations. There were multiple food samples passed throughout the event and all were incredibly delicious! I loved the savory Parmigiano-Regiano Cheesecake (so yummy), really liked the Tangy BBQ Chicken with Port Caramelized Red Onions flatbread, and the Chicken Parmesan. Everything was incredibly fresh and delicious. Thanks, Ally for the wonderful hospitality and supporting local nonprofits! I'll be back with some friends for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Just tried their new location. Great atmosphere and service. Outdoor patio and nice, comfortable atmosphere inside. The wine selection is awesome and the food is delicious. Not only do they serve appetizers they have full dinners. Our group had the duck nachos, a Delphonie flat bread, rustic pasta,  lamb meatballs, specialty salad and the steak salad.  Everything was delicious. Check this locally owned place out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had a great time here. It is a nice casual place to get drinks with friends. The guy who was there was super friendly and nice, and even patiently waited until my friends and I were done with our conversation despite the fact that we had stayed past closing time. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great wine selection and the food is fabulous.   The service is always good as well.   I love the feel of the place.  I often eat dinner alone at the bar and am always comfortable and treated well."}
{"text":"What a cool place! Very relaxing environment, dim lighting, comfy sofas and spread out tables for privacy. The interesting white wine of tap from Portugal is very good, different than anything I've tried before. Def will be going here often!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous! Great menu. Great wine list. Superior craft beer selection. The cheese plate is a work of art. Extremely generous with loads of accompaniments. The candied nuts are a favorite. Pasta Rustica is unbelievably delicious. Run, don't walk to try this place. The owner is here all the time watching over the quality and service. It's simply wonderful!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the comfy atmosphere and delicious food as well as the wonderful flight of wine!"}
{"text":"We've been waiting patiently for the new location of Uncorked to be open and it was definitely worth the wait. Went by there on Monday night for half off glasses of wine and it did not disappoint! Not only is this location much larger, but the menu items are even better than ever!

This is not your average little wine bar, but it's like visiting family every time you go. Ali and Tim (owners) makes you feel like you've known them forever, and the same goes with the \"regulars\" you'll often sit next to at the bar. 

This place is excellent for groups, couples and even perfect if you just want to get away by yourself. This new location has a wine room that can be closed off where you can schedule private events.

This will definitely become a North Scottsdale staple!"}
{"text":"This would be in my opinion, a true Diamond in the Rough.  Not just because everything about this place is spot on, but because it's kinda difficult to find.  Located just a few hundred yards north of Frank Lloyd Wright on Scottsdale Rd., it's tucked in the middle of a small strip center that doesn't have strong street presence.  If you know where Sushi Brokers is at, Uncorked is about 5 doors down from them.
The owner has a wealth of experience in the food business and equally smart when it comes to adult beverages.  Her beer & wine selection was \"the best of the best\" and sold at very fair prices.  I saw the bartender assembling a Sampler for some people that were given 3 small glasses of wine each to try a nice variety.  I would imagine you could do that with their beers on tap, but I forgot to ask.
The food that I tried was excellent.  Very much like her adult beverages, the food was a very nice collection of both American & International favorites.  I wanted to try a few of their Italian dishes - the lasagna and then the meatball plate.  Both were very, very good.
My only complaint is they don't serve liquor.  I enjoy rum every once in a while and wish they had that license.  But, for a great wine, beer & food experience, I'm giving Uncorked 5 stars all day."}
{"text":"So many, so grateful Uncorked is back! This little wine bar was the \"Cheers\" for so many regulars over the years. When they lost the lease at Promenade, we too were a bit lost.  Owners Tim and Ali made the wait worthwhile with the opening of Uncorked in their new, convenient location. The have created the same warm and friendly atmosphere we all love, in a bigger space, that somehow still feels cozy, like you are at the home of a friend....and YOU ARE. Belly up to the bar solo and get to know your knowledgable server, a friend for girl/guy talk, a date, or even a large group of friends. The wine selection is first rate and the full menu complements the wine with perfection. PROMISE, you will love the new UNCORKED!!!"}
{"text":"This has to be the most un wine bar I have ever seen. I have traveled to many a wine bar in many states & countries and thought it was lacking in wine offered. The wine flights is the only saving grace which is why I gave it a 1/2 point. Also the decor I give it a 1/2 point.
Not sure how a wine bar can survive with no white bottles for sale on menu and a very limited wine bottle menu of only 20 reds wines by the bottle with 12 out of 20 being between $100- $250+?? Wine bars usually have 100 plus of each red / white wines to offer folks by the bottle and glass and the staff knows the wines they serve and even know the off the wall ones that folks may seek out. They need a a better assortment of wines and a much better price point for me to buy a bottle here if I was to ever to return again. The key issue will I ever return is probably no I will not with the current line up of very limited wines by both the bottle & glass. Perhaps the staff should be hired that are the ones more \"wine geek like\" than servers whom are clueless!
Cheers"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I move to Arizona... I've always told people about this place and have taken my out of town visitors here. Today's experience really ruined my views and thoughts on this establishment. I messaged them in May asking when the next 10 for $10 tasting was, I was told Saturday  June 16. I invited my hiking group friends to the tasting for a girls afternoon out. I even called in and made a table reservation for the 9 of us the week prior to the tasting. We show up today and was told the tasting was moved to next weekend, since it was Father's Day weekend they didn't think anyone would come. I would be lying if I said I wasn't TRULY disappointed!!!! No one at this establishment even bothered to call or message me and my group of 9 to tell us that the date was changed. We got there and it was like nothing even happened , no care in the world. I had friends that drove 40 plus mins to come to the tasting and this establishment for the first time ever. The thing that got me is that we weren't even offered an apology or anything. I have worked in the restaurant and service industry for over 8 years and just feel this was such a let down. If you know you have a party of 9 coming in for an event and the event is canceled you should notify them. I'm just very displeased with the way this entire situation was  handled today and feel very let down."}
{"text":"Great food, good wine and excellent service!!! The lamb meatballs were absolutely delicious!! We talked with a couple of employees and they were extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the area. I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"So glad this place reopened in new location. Super comfortable atmosphere. Great food. Great wine choices. They have beer on tap and also getting a liquor license for those who prefer a cocktail. The baked cheese encrusted with hazelnuts is to die for."}
{"text":"Great wine bar! We went in a Saturday evening and tried a few of the red and white wine flights. We shared the cheese tray and we truly enjoyed our evening. Everyone was courteous and knowledgeable. We will visit again!"}
{"text":"This place is bigger inside than you'd think. A group of friends sat in one of the couch sections to enjoy some wine and beer. They offer wine flights and some pretty good food options. My husband and I shared the Italian sandwich that came with a side (we ordered chips but got slaw, they corrected and gave us both). The sandwich was very good and both of us felt full with our 1/2 sandwich. My husband really liked the slaw, I thought it was kind of spicy. 
Nice place, our server was nice and kept checking in on us while we were there.
My only disappointment was that we were there on Thursday night and it's football season and they don't have any NFL channels so don't try to watch sports here."}
{"text":"Great service and friendly staff.  Local ownership.  Beer and wine only but some really great choices.   Only had time for a quick visit but will be back soon for happy hour and flank steak sandwich.  

Well worth the stop."}
{"text":"This was a favorite hideaway in its previous location. After trying it in its new \"storefront\" location' I was left underwhelmed and disappointed.  The space is cavernous now and to my surprise mostly empty on Saturday night at 7:00PM in high season. 

The menu definitely looks delicious. We tried the cheeseboard and it did not disappoint.  One small slice of each of three cheeses seemed a little skimpy, but we broke it into tiny pieces and nibbled through.  Cleaned the plate!

My real disappointment - the server had no clue about the wines or cheeses. My first glass of Chardonnay was amazing. When I asked her about the notes I was tasting she said she had never tried it and knew nothing about it. The second glass of wine, supposedly from the same bottle, was horrible, harsh and undrinkable.  I sent it back. Ordered a different wine. Later she brought me another taste of the first wine after I suggested perhaps there was soap in the glass. It was as bad as the first. Mystery.

When the chessboard arrived I asked her which cheese was which. She said she did not know what I ordered nor did she know the different cheeses on sight. Mystery. 

This restaurant would be the perfect set up for a small stage area where light acoustic guitar could be played. Instead they played some canned pop music. They should take a page from 5th and Wine's patio before it ended its run in downtown Scottsdale. 

Although they comped a glass of wine due to the experience, my honey and I will not be back unless something dramatic changes. This is a place that could be special. But it's not. So much unrealized potential. 

I hope the owners read this and make it better. I am so rooting for them."}
{"text":"Uncorked - also a great place for food \"to go\" ! I so enjoy this wine bar- great food and ambiance so when I had my BF fly in from the west coast on her birthday- Another of our BFs joined me in picking her up at PHX- flight delays- she was 2 hrs late- Arrived my home to bottles of wine (from Uncorked) and food that I had picked up earlier in the day... The Parmesan savory cheese cake, cheese board, cobb salad and a chocolate birthday cake were a plus plus hit with the 3 of us and of course the wine...."}
{"text":"We were excited to try something new in the neighborhood that we could potentially ride our bikes to this summer.  We were disappointed from the outset with the smell of nail polish eminatng from the shop next door. That took a bit to get over. Suggestion; a candle or something to mask the smell near the front door. After a while you got used to it but we sat as far away from that side of the room as possible and at the bar. The bartender was nice and helpful. Only 1 option for the happy hour \"Daily Drinker\". A Zinfandel, nothing white and it was 96 degrees outside. Suggestion; Billy Joel (\"A bottle of red, a bottle of white...\"). Tried the BBQ chicken flat bread. Not good. Chocked it down. Asked for a caraf to share another glass, no caraf's. Oh well. We were thanked for coming as we left but not talked with while there. Too bad. Good luck. 2 wine lovers and potential patrons lost."}
{"text":"Came here last night because it's right across the street from my hotel. It was definitely a breath of fresh air from the usual tilted kilt I went to the two nights before. The food was absolutely amazing. Mac and cheese and sliders were awesome. The mac and cheese could've well been the best I've ever had. Upon walking in and leaving I was greeted both times. I can't stress enough to business owners and restaurant owners how important this really is. The ambience was great, slightly casual, which gave it a  unpretentious feel which is good. As a wine lover and drinker, living in San Francisco for 4 years and visiting napa every other weekend I would say the one thing they need to change is they need to have their wine flights in standard wine glasses. The point of a flight of wine is to really analyze every sip, from the beginning nose and swirl to the finish. With the smaller glasses, you take away the beginning enjoyment of the wine. Other than that, they are doing an amazing job and can see great things in their future."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared several wine flights and enjoyed tasty salads with our wine.  Everything was fresh with unique flavors - Spiced Pear Salad and Uncorked Cobb salad with dried blueberries, pumpkin seeds turkey and smoked cheese.  Everyone was friendly, helpful with a comfortable atmosphere.  Several fun seating areas and tables."}
{"text":"Excellent wine choices, with good beer options for my husband.  Salads and sandwiches are excellent.  And, then, of course, there are the lamb stuffed meatballs - which are a favorite.  Good service, nice vibe, you may walk in alone, but you'll leave having made new friends."}
{"text":"This is a perfect  place to come have a good glass of wine and a delicious cheese board. Our meals were yummy and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"While we have never eaten here, we LOVE the atmosphere and wine options! Duh a great date night place either after dinner, for the date, or even with friends. It has such a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere. Also, card games etc. that are always enjoyable to play during drinks! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The outside and inside seating was comfortable. We started with wine, beer , and a cheese tray  It was  really ridiculous how small the portions of cheese were and the stale toast that came with it.  So many other places offer cheese plates that are far better and more generous  We then all had assorted sandwiches that were just average. Prices were high and the bill came to 200 dollars for the small amount we ordered. Don't waste your time or money. There are far better places to drink and dine in the valley."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the service, atmosphere, and the way they serve wine flights. Gives an opportunity to enjoy several different wines.  The servers were knowledgeable and made it fun. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"5 stars for the wine, 4 stars for the food.

Don't get me wrong, this place has delicious food, but the wine is FANTASTIC.

My mother and I have made a point to try as many wine lounges around the Scottsdale area as we can find. Of the ones we tried, this one has the best wine for a great price.

Twice I've gone to this place - both times ordering a wine flight (and each time buying a bottle of wine). I've tried some of their flatbreads, salads, and a dessert. 

My favorites food-wise include the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheesecake with sliced pears and a toasted baguette (I love cheese and this is just the right amount of food and savory flavor for an appetizer) and the poached pear salad (I guess I like pears - what can I say!).

But, as I said, the wine is hands-down my favorite. I'm more of a white wine person, myself (even though, I have tried a red wine flight). My favorite flight is the fun and fruity one. My mom and I have bought two wines that I highly recommend - Argentinian New Age White and the German Selzer Osterberg Riesling."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed. I've read good reviews but that was not my experience. Wine was good and half off for happy hour, hence 3 stars. The service was fair... 3 of us walked in and we get one menu. Had to ask 2 times for more menus and we were the only ones there. Food was less than good but not horrible.   Had great expectations but this place didn't deliver. Doubt we'd go  back"}
{"text":"So glad to have them back!  Beautiful location - looks like home!  Great food and promising new additions to come!  Great service - excellent happy hour. Congrats - great to have you open again. Will
be back often!"}
{"text":"What a great place to sit outside on the patio or at an intimate table with excellent food and extensive wine list.  Our service was perfect with great recommendations. I will for sure visit again when in the area!"}
{"text":"Very quaint neighborhood wine bar awesome owners great service and the food is absolutely amazing. Everything I've eaten there has been top notch. They have a nice size room for private parties"}
{"text":"A friend and I came here the other night.  We enjoyed a few glasses of wine and several small plates. I personally like the ambiance.  They have many tables and a few spots with couches for a pretty chill and relaxed atmosphere.  Nice, large bar area. It is an extremely clean facility.

The wines were good, crisp whites-perfect for summer in Scottsdale.  They were recommended to us.  

The food was tasty-love, love, love the cheese board.  The other times we tried were good as well.  

Our service was top-notch.  We were very well taken care of throughout the night.
I would definitely come again!  In cooler months they have a really nice patio too!"}
{"text":"I feel bad as we stepped in and sat outside than moved in but the place stunk (bad odor) and was dead.  I know when she was across the street we liked it but more options now, friendly peeps and right timed Happy Hours close by!  Step-it up or Cork it...try an early HH with nibblers and pop in some live music at times?  Populate that here..."}
{"text":"familiar with the vineyards they sold.  We tried a few flights and the wines were just ok.  The wine glasses for the flights are rather tacky though, I'm used to a wine bar having better wine glasses.

Food was decent, nothing really special, but decent.

The place was rather dead when we went, so made us wonder how popular this place is.  
Overall, the visit was OK, worth giving it a try for yourself and seeing what you think."}
{"text":"Love this place! So happy they have reopened at this new location...great food, wine and ambience!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Whether I'm feeling adventurous and want to try a flight of different wines or choose a glass, they always have the best selection. Shockingly, I love the FOOD even more! Parmigiano-Regianno Cheesecake is a must. It's a savory appetizer that is unlike anything you could order anywhere else! Perfect for date night or a relaxed night out. Feels very \"homey\", almost like an extension of your own living room."}
{"text":"Uncorked is a great option for a girls night out or just any night out! They have great specials and options. My favorite is the champagne flight! The charcuterie board was so-so. You are able to pick your cheese options to include on the board, I think we may have just selected the wrong cheese choices. The patio out front is a great space with the twinkle lights at night! I love this place and will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Great wine and food and excellent service!! I usually go to postinos but after coming here I don't think I would ever go back to postinos! Great atmosphere especially for a date night. Have to go on mondays for their wine specials!"}
{"text":"Unbelieveable Duck Nachos. Great wine and atmosphere. Must do while in Scottsdale. Excellent pkace for a quick snack or a great dinner."}
{"text":"Good food. Chicken pot pie was great. Disappointed a wine bar did not have a Riesling wine."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The staff is friendly, and the food is not only reasonably priced, but also delicious. Unlike other restaurants of its kind, I can get a pulled pork sandwich here without getting nauseous since it's not slathered in sauce, yet it's still wonderfully tasty. Everything is done quite tastefully, and it's a wonderful mix of classy and casual. You could come here for a special occasion, but you could also pop by any day of the week for a very relaxed yet lovely time. There are many nooks and crannies to this space--typical tables, high tables, lounge areas and couches, etc. The decor is very nice and filled with subtle character. It's a very dynamic space, which makes the different parts worlds unto themselves. There's also an event room that can be rented. It's very nice. They have events in there somewhat regularly I believe. 

I've tried: pulled pork sandwich, club sandwich, uncorked chopped salad. All were perfect. The club was probably my favorite though! Everything's in a great price range compared to some other places of a similar caliber. It's only been here for 6 months, but it's already amazing! Go!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The unpretentious wine bar.  Very true.  Great Monday madness flight specials.  Awesome staff.  Nice relaxing atmosphere.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Meh. Sterile and not the greatest service. The bartender kinda mad dogged us the entire time we sat there. Which is weird because we were a couple. Bad flirting?

Who knows. Will not return."}
{"text":"Wonderful place that deserves to succeed. Food was interesting, well prepared, large menu with good choices. Server was very knowledgeable about the choices. They allowed us to taste the wines too.  Comfortable atmosphere with good background music to allow for conversation; not so loud that you couldn't enjoy the people you are with. Nice couches for relaxed happy hour too. Just can't rave enough. Brilliant recipe of simple and comfortable. Reasonable prices for quality!"}
{"text":"So glad to have Uncorked back! It's a great wine bar with plenty of drink options, delish food, and fun staff. The owners are two of the best people you'll meet. My favorite eats are the wine lovers Mac & Cheese and the pear salad. Yumm!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Always a great time at Uncorked.  Just finished a wine tasting there.  Food is delicious and staff is amazing."}
{"text":"Popped by this place while on a business trip. Quiet on a Tuesday night but service was A+. Enjoyed a wine flight and the duck nachos. The nachos were filling for dinner and so incredibly delicious. Cute spot and will return when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"If your looking for a great wine bar in north scottsdale you've found it. 
It's been around for a number of years. But their new location is bigger and better!
