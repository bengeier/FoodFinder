{"text":"For a restaurant in a mall, this is a pretty good Italian place. The food is good, hot and arrived quickly. Quite a large menu of standard restaurant Italian fare but the cooking standard was high and it looked, smelled and tasted good. Outside seating has the advantage of being a great place for people-watching while you eat. Drinks prices are what you'd expect, pricey for a not particularly inspired selection of wines. Beers were OK but again not a huge selection. Only disappointment was the so-called Tiramisu for desert, which was nothing like a real one."}
{"text":"On a recent hungover trip to the Trafford Centre, my friends and I decided to stop for a meal. We craved a lot and we craved it now.  Seated in the lovely 'outside terrace' of Est Est Est we quickly ordered drinks - the fruit punch is divine and perfect for combating extreme wine intake. As a starter I had the breadcrumbed mushrooms and mozarella with tomato salsa which was delicious and the sauce was just the right amount of tangy to balance the richness of the cheese.   For my main, I ordered the Pollo Al Forno which was chicken on top of a pasta base with grana padano and spinach. It was lovely but the wait for the food was really long and we did have to ask what the reason for this was. The fact that it wasn't terribly busy, being a weekday, didn't help their case.   The food is good but quite expensive and is probably replicated elsewhere just as well. All the Est chains are now changing to Gusto now anyway so in the near future it will probably change over."}
{"text":"Very good service from the staff. Good selection of pasta pizza and chicken dishes on the menu. I had the bruschetta starter which was fantastic some of the way bruschetta I've had. Price wise, reasonable and a nice spot in the Trafford Centre to have an informal meal. Will be back!"}
{"text":"A mixture chain of Zizzi's and Piccolino's menu with a mature atmosphere and decor. It loses some relaxation to your experience here because of this. You are seated and your waiter/tress is attentive but it's hard to feel pleased when the place is situated next to the funnel walkway allowing the stream of shoppers with hungry stomachs to peer over your shoulder at what you're eating - being watched whilst eating something quite delicious extracts the enjoyment. The menu serves a variety and the chefs provide hot, tasty tasty grub. If the situation of this restaurant was elsewhere, I'm sure I would enjoy it more."}
{"text":"Hey - what do you expect?  It is in a mall, it is in a thoroughfare and it is pretty standard Italian.  I guess it gets a 3* - A-OK because I wouldn't say a Yay! I'm a fan.  I'm pretty sure when next at the Trafford Centre we won't be saying 'Let's go to Est again\" more likely \"Let's see what somewhere else is like\".  Now all this said, there was nothing wrong with the service, food, wine or ambience for that matter.  Everything was fine, OK, alright, not bad.  Do you see what I mean, there just wasn't enough to make it a firm favourite.  Service was relaxed, polite and attentive.  There was an activity pack for the children which is always a bonus.  We had a steak focaccia sandwich, a goats cheese salad and side of fries and a sausage and fries for our daughter.  All the food was hot, tasty and fresh.  I would say not to come here if you are really hungry.  Portions are small and £2.95 for about 20 fries in a bowl is a bit of a sickener.  Luckily we were not there for a banquet and it was a nice interval to a days hard shopping.  \"Does what it says on the can, well but not exceptionally so\"."}
{"text":"Wow what a difference in customer service, in comparison to the Hourglass at Piccadilly..  I popped in Here for lunch as I had a cheque of £35 to use from Trg Concessions , after an appalling service in Hourglass at Piccadilly Train Station..  The food here does not offer homemade burgers but Italian food. Approaching the Italianesque restaurants, we were greeted and seated outside with great enthusiasm. I could not fault the level of care from beginning to end. Even the manageress came out several times to ensure everything was okay.  To start we chose the garlic bread to share accompanied by mushrooms rissoto balls. I have to say this was surprisingly one of the best garlic pizza breads I have had. The base was light and airy with lots of garlic...nom! The risotto balls were tasty , firm on the outside and soft and ricey in the middle.  The Mains where everything drops slightly in wow factor. It is rare I choose a veggie dish, but I decided on the butternut squash with pine nuts, and my companion the chicken scallops. The presentation was not great , and mine was just a roast butternut squash, no hidden surprises and a bland salad to match..also not enough pine nuts! The chicken was also apparently bland and very dry...  The Peroni was good to wash this down..Overall I think this place is a tad pricey in reflection to what you receive. If they offered the same quality and variety of food as the Hourglass but maintain the high level of customer care this would easily be a 4 star place."}
{"text":"Decent fast-food chain Italian, ala Zizzi and Strada (though, better than Strada). Good selection, fast service, all in all, a good choice for a quick meal. Plus, they have entree-size salads, which are great for a lunch (shocking lack of good salads at most restaurants I've found), when you don't want to be loaded down with carbs as you're wandering around the shops at Trafford. I had their EST salad, which was a delightful combination of lettuce, roasted peppers, tomatoes, goat cheese and avocado, topped with pine nuts. I would have liked the pine nuts to be toasted, but hey-- it's a minor grievance. My husband had the seafood risotto which judging by the expediency of his cleaning his plate, I class as pretty good. My starter-- meatballs, was perfectly seasoned and served with deliciously toasted ciabatta; My husband's calamari was a bit soggy... unfortunately something that's becoming the norm at too many restaurants (come on people-- get it together! Fried calamari is meant to be CRISPY!). In all, decent mall food experience."}
{"text":"Est Est Est or also known as Mathematics nerds as Est^3 (or is it just me?) is a single restaurant serving Italian food in the Trafford Centre, I'd like to start off saying how interesting I find it to find a chain, which isn't part of a large brand to be in a shopping mall, but sadly this wasn't a good thing in the case of Est^3  Upon trying to enter, there were multiple queuing without a member of staff in sight, I waited a minute or two just to find out about their gluten free options before I had no choice but to call them, sadly the phone was nowhere near the customer queuing, but I still stayed right outside in view of the staff here while chatting to them on the phone.  I'd like to firstly state that to be in a restaurant and to find service so bad you actually have to phone them to get someone to come over to you and help you is quite outrageous.  I asked about gluten free options and once again the staff didn't seem to be too friendly or helpful, they told me they didn't have gluten free pasta or pizza, but they didn't want to tell me what, this made me have less confidence in dining here, making me feel I would become ill which wasn't right, chatting to the waitress felt awkward, it felt like she had a lack of interest in her work and helping me find something to eat, in the end I decided to visit somewhere else having been given up with poor service and the staff seeming careless with a reasonably quiet restaurant with so many people queuing outside, this was mishandled."}
