{"text":"They have vegan milk powders here !!!! However I only ordered a jasmine tea, so yummy !! Son ordere a chocolate milk tea with brown sugar boba...pretty tasty as well. Staff were all helpful and friendly my only complaint is the parking. Same plaza as restaurants, bars and the comedy club so even though it was free, it was a pain !"}
{"text":"We ordered a passion fruit slushy with boba and two of the house swirl milk tea.  First the service, they were friendly and helpful seemed enthusiastic about their products.  The regular brown sugar boba is one of the best we have had in town and the tea was flavorful doesn't seem to be drown out with the sweetness of the sugar and cream.  Will definitely come back again!!"}
{"text":"I adore this place, the service, and the variety of boba flavors. The place also has such a pleasant sweet smell too. I have had the galaxy drink two times and the other times, I have generally had their jasmine tea and other milk teas. Their drinks are super pretty.  The employees there are always so sweet and kind too. The only drawbacks would perhaps be the generally high costs and sometimes long wait times (when it gets crowded) but otherwise, this little location has great drinks and is a fun go-to place for university students."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite place to get some real boba tea! Not only is the space really cute (probably not big enough for study parties, sorry!) it's got one of the most comprehensive boba tea menus I've ever seen.   My friend brought me here on a Sunday afternoon, and I was pleasantly surprised by the menu- everything looked super refreshing, and I especially loved that you can customize your drink by sweetness level and ice. (I recommend 50% or less sugar)   They brew their teas fresh everyday, and their milk teas are legit. Their crema teas have a layer of salty cream on top that is just so, so good. If you've ever been to 85c bakery in California it's a lot like their sea salt coffees or sea salt green teas.   Their boba is just the right texture and sweetness. I seriously love this place and would recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Everyone here is super nice and friendly, I love this place (: my favorite is the mango slush with boba!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  They have a great selection of different teas, slushes, and toppings.  Plus you can customize your drink with sugar and ice level.  I tried the House Swirl Milk Tea with pudding and 50% sugar level and it was great!"}
{"text":"Great selection of tea drinks with good mix-ins.  Good clear menu that shows the choices and how to customize them.  Quick service.  A Chinese menu is available."}
{"text":"I LOVE how customizable the drinks are here. The ability to choose the level of sweetness is brilliant. Only downside is that I got there right at opening and there was no boba available"}
{"text":"I went again and tried a different set of drinks. This time I had the taro milk tea and the strawberry cream slush. The taro milk tea seemed to have a weak flavor to me and I would have liked it to have had a stronger taste. The strawberry cream slush was quite delicious, but it is one of their more expensive drinks."}
{"text":"Great selection and they were able to adjust the sweetness which i like. The place was packed. Too noisy to hang out and chat with all the blenders going, but it was a nice space. Just wish boba places had a decaf tea option."}
{"text":"Good service; patient employees that are willing to take the time to help me decide what to order. Also, interesting variety of drinks, such as the fizzy drinks. Pleasant and very bright atmosphere. Downside: the only black tea available is earl gray which is not everyone's fave black tea. But ok, I got the earl gray and...it was too milky to really taste the tea. I would definitely come back, however, and give Tea Swirl another go."}
{"text":"Nice boba tea shop with a helpful staff. It was my first time here and was graciously guided through the endless menu options. Decided on a drink and tried white peach boba per their recommendation and boy was it tasty. Great place to sit down and work on the computer in a calm laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pretty good boba! Was honestly going to give up on finding decent boba in Arizona, but would recommend this place!  Got the jasmine green milk tea and it was great! Boba had a nice chewy texture and tea was good."}
{"text":"Was not impressed.   I usually judge a tea shop from their basic milk tea which this place doesn't really have? I don't know, I'm a little confuse. There is a picture of milk tea on the wall so when I asked for one and they say that they don't have it, I don't really understand. They did offer something similar so I went ahead and order it but it's definitely not the milk tea I'm looking for. To top it off, it was pretty pricey and I left feeling disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this little boba shop! They have a good variety of flavor options, good boba and allow you to pick your sweetness level. My favorite is their Okinawa tea! I like how there is plenty of seating space and wifi. All drinks are custom mixed so while their prep may be slower than other shops, the end result is well worth the wait! It also helps that their staff friendly, helpful and does a great job of keeping the place clean!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of Baba tea in my life and Tea Swirl is by far my favorite  The owner Ting is also super hospitable."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the tea there. Good quality of tea and great customer service. You also can customized the flavor. I visited the shop every time I visited the town. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I love that you can choose the amount of sweetness and ice for your drink. The house special and Hokkaido milk tea is highly recommended. The staff is super nice, too!"}
{"text":"Tea Swirl is great! I wish there was one closer to me in downtown Phoenix. They had lots of options without being overwhelming. I liked being able to choose the sweetness and ice level, and the customer service was excellent. Multiple options for boba and other mix-ins."}
{"text":"One of my favorite boba places in the valley. Awesome vibe, awesome workers, awesome drinks. Not to mention the owner here is super chill (aaaaye Ting).  I've gotten over 90% of their menu items over the two years. Overall, positive experience with the drinks. The consistency of sugar level is satisfactory.   Pretty good place to work/study. They take feedback well and have made some arrangements with seating based on customers' suggestions.   The only downside of this place is the parking - you get some kids who just can't park/drive to save their lives. But hey that's no fault of Tea Swirls :)"}
{"text":"Tea? More like a cup of straight up diabetes. The taste reminds me of Kool-Aid, but sweeter. Came here for tea, ended up paying $5 for a cup of Kool-Aid. Over hyped and overpriced. 2 stars cuz it did look pretty cool before mixing."}
{"text":"Very strange tasting drink.. looks good in pics but not palatable.   I had the \"blue\" drink. It tastes like 7-up, blue food color, and very strong vinegar..   Not good at all.. the place is modern, and staff are friendly, but how can they survive when the drinks are so off putting..   Maybe try a different drink on their menu, but avoid the drinks with vinegar!"}
{"text":"Not as great as I thought it would be. Drink is mediocre...not great. It is near by a college place so maybe that is where they gets most of their business."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The tea is great and the atmosphere is great! My favorite thing is if you bring your own mason jar or cup they will use it! I usually get an earl grey milk tea no ice w/ honey, brown sugar boba and 20% sweetness."}
{"text":"This place is legit. They don't have quite as many options as some places, but they make up for it with delicious drinks and amazing service. They are so friendly! The menu is a little difficult to navigate, but they are happy to answer questions and give suggestions. I highly recommend this place. I love the jasmine milk tea, taro milk tea and okinawa milk tea. Brown sugar boba is super yummy! Thanks for being awesome!"}
{"text":"Drove all the way from Phoenix to Tempe to try this place and we were not disappointed. We got the Pomegranate Sparkling, The Special Galaxy , and the Blue Angel. They were all really good and the staff was very helpful and answered every question we had. I will definitely make the drive to come back again and try the milk teas next time!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to get boba. Customer service was excellent and very helpful in helping me select my drink. I ended up taking the house milk tea with boba. The tea was $3.75 and the boba was $0.50. The milk tea itself is very authentic! Best I've ever had in along time. They allow you to pick your level of sweetness as well! I picked 80% which was perfect for my liking! I will definitely be back no doubt!"}
{"text":"Great place! The bf has marked this his new favorite boba spot. He had a milk tea with regular boba, and I had a slush with white boba."}
{"text":"For a boba tea shop, they can do much better. I went on a Saturday night and it took 25minutes to get my boba tea. The quality of the slush had large pieces of ice. The pearls were difficult to get through the straw because the ice chunks would get in the way.   They had their blenders in a separate room, so the noise level was moderate unlike most boba tea shops. They have a loyalty program if you're into this place. I appreciate the Yelp check in discount though!"}
{"text":"Awk, I'm reviewing this place again just to amend my previous statement. There is actually a better milk tea place in town, especially for the salty crema. I won't mention it on this review though. I'd go back to Tea Swirl if I was in the area and had a hankering for boba. teehee"}
{"text":"Cute little boba shop by ASU. I like that they give you an option on levels of ice and sweetness. Mango lychee black tea is my drink of choice here. One complaint is that their milk teas taste very watered down."}
{"text":"Glad this area finally got a boba place. The interior is simple, and clean. Small amount of seating, but adequate for the amount of retail space the store occupies; a narrow sliver of space. Seating is less desirable, as they are uncomfortable and cheap. There is no restroom inside, instead you have to use a locker restroom outside of the store, via key provided by them. I've been to my good share of boba places and this isn't kid friendly at all.  Seats are too close together, nothing to entertain the kids, and I didn't even want to attempt the bathroom to know if there was a changing table or not. Now the drinks, the menu would be confusing if your a first timer to boba drinks. Menu doesn't tell you what some of the flavors are; some are self explanatory like taro, Thai, etc.; but there are other flavors or blends they've signatured that you'll have to inquire about. There is only ONE size... and on several of the drinks they ask you what sweetness % you want... but what do you have to compare?! Take the safe route and go with 20%... ordering boba drinks shouldn't be this complex or difficult, but you might scratch your head and perplex yourself as you stare at the menu. I tried my safe flavor -- Taro Slush with boba, and it turned out good as expected. I'll defiantly try another flavor next visit, and yes, regardless of my comments, I'd still give this place another try."}
{"text":"One of the best boba places I have been to in Arizona! They have a really great selection of milk teas (which are dairy-free... score)!  The first time I was here I had the jasmine milk tea which was very good.    This time, I had the Okinawa milk tea, which seems to be a very popular option. It is a pretty sweet milk tea that almost has a custard flavor to it. I also had it with the brown sugar boba, which only comes in the Mini size now.   The best thing about this place is the fact that you can customize your sweetness and amount of ice. You can get no ice, normal, or light ice. The sweetness comes on a percentage scale. This means you can get 100% if you like the sweet like me, or anything in between! Some like it at 20% for just a little bit of sweetness or they even offer sugar free!   The also have many different add ins. Boba, white boba, brown sugar boba, lychee, etc."}
{"text":"Decent price for smoothie and tapioca. They have friendly customer service.  The inside is very minimalistic but works well with the atmosphere.  They make the smoothies relatively fast without skipping the quality.  Overall,  if i was in Phoenix again,  i would stop by for more"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times already and I can honestly say that their drinks are very decent. They use a combination of tea and milk so you can really taste a good portion from both. You can customized your ice and sweetness level. Kudos to that! The place is pretty small but besides that everything is great. Good customers service and they make your drinks fast! Will definitely be back to try their other drinks!"}
{"text":"The best boba tea ever!! I like the creamy milk tea and the milk tea here is so rich. As I know, they use Organic sugar to make every drink! Just love it?"}
{"text":"Ever since this place has opened, it has a close relationship with my heart. I have ordered countless drinks and taken a lot of great photos. I highly recommend trying ice jelly, but more on tea based drinks because of the flavor combo. I think the crema drinks are very slept on, I've never tried it until a friend ordered it and after going here since the beginning have never thought to ever order or try it. It's a nice blend of tea/cafe and a cream on top waiting to get mixed in. The blue angel and rising Phoenix are also one of my favorite drinks here. I usually visit once a week or so when I have time."}
{"text":"Being Chinese and from the Bay Area in California has left a serious void for good pearl milk tea in my life in Arizona. This place has hands down the best milk tea I've been able to find in the Phoenix area since moving to ASU four years ago. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is usually my go-to place for boba because of 1) convenience, it's right next to ASU and very close to my apartment, and 2) quality. The boba here is consistently good, with good texture and chewiness. Since I'm not very adventurous I usually just stick to regular house milk tea boba or okinawan milk tea boba, both at 50% sweetness and less ice. I'd recommend that you start at 50% sweetness if you want a sweet drink that's not cloying and 20% sweetness if you really want to appreciate the taste of the tea more. The boba here is a bit pricier but you get what you pay for I guess? The service is also usually quick which is a huge plus for people like me that just swing by grab a boba and run."}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday. Really small spot, kinda easy to miss. It's hard to find good bubble tea spots in Arizona. However, I was really happy with this place! I got the jade tea swirl with crema and boba. I loved it, so delicious. Will be visiting this place when I'm around the area!"}
{"text":"Yelped a boba spot while in the area and Tea Swirl popped up.  We had the galaxy and blue angel. Both drinks were super sweet. Not my favorite drinks but I we did pick the drinks based on the pictures. Lol.   Next time I'll stick to the regular milk teas."}
{"text":"Tea Swirl has a variety of fun drinks to try! It's a cute little shop with friendly staff and a minimalistic feel. I have tried most of their milk and fruity teas and toppings, and would recommend any fruit tea to be paired with the lychee jelly (a personal favorite)! For milk teas, any of their bobas are great! They usually have a new sample of something off menu to try.   Pro-tip: Of you're specifically looking for boba, come earlier in the evening. If you wait until the last hour or two of the day, there is a chance that they may have run out of regular boba.   Overall, this place is worth it. It's popular among college students and has a convenient location just northeast of the ASU Tempe campus. Students can stop in for a drink and grab a seat to study. There is a lot of parking for those who are driving!"}
{"text":"Best regret I've ever had! Being in a diet and finding a great boba place is like playing tug of war with your dog: you'll never win.   Growing up in 626 California, land of boba, has made me spoiled. So when I moved to Arizona, I've been on the hunt for similar boba drinks to back home. Found T swirl on yelp and have never been happier. I've gotten the oolong (house) milk tea, jasmine green milk tea and the Okinawa milk tea. I've had all of them with black and white boba.   Boba: black boba, texture is perfect! But wish they had a honey boba option to make it a bit sweeter. Otherwise, near perfect boba! WHITE BOBA, texture is near perfect. The times I've had white boba, the texture made it seem like it was a bit of older boba? Other than that, the taste is basically the same. 4/5   Okinawa milk tea: VERY sweet. So if you're a sweet tooth, this will be the drink for you! 4/5 (I'm not a sweet tooth).  Oolong (house) milk tea: perfect drink if you're looking for a caffeine kick. Perfect sweetness. Perfect all around drink for the caffeine addicted. 5/5  Jasmine green milk tea: perfect light milk tea that doesn't weigh you down when you're done drinking. Light and floral-y taste. 5/5   Servers are awesome! Always happy to serve you and willing to give suggestions if needed. Also patient if you're taking a bit to order(oops!)   Parking lot can be crowded on certain days because of buffalo wild wings and the improv club. But otherwise it's free. There are other cuisines in this plaza as well so if you get hungry, you can just walk right over.   Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I really like how they divided ice and sugar options in the menu for every single drinks. So far I have tried Oolong Milk Tea with baby boba, regular House boba, and Matcha greentea with boba. I usually order regular ice with 80% sweetness, and I'm good to go. Staff are fast and super friendly, and don't forget to use the check-in deals. They honor that as well!"}
{"text":"Super fast service and the staff is EXTREMELY friendly. I was really craving boba and just happened to be in the area. The guy at the cash register let me sample some of their boba, and he also helped me decide on a flavor and sweetness level. I got the earl grey milk tea with brown sugar boba, 50% sweetness. I wish it was a little less sweet, but the flavor was fantastic! And this place is  CUTE! I would definitely study here if it were closer. Also, parking shouldn't be an issue because there's a large, shared private lot."}
{"text":"Super yummy tea and really friendly staff. The place has a great atmosphere, you can sit and study or just grab something to go. I will definitely be back to study."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly and helpful. They explained every details that we, newbies, asked. Also, since it is on the FiveStars app, I can start getting discounts too. Way better than Chatime in Tucson! Wish I found  this out earlier although I live 10 min away"}
{"text":"I love going here to grab a quick okinawa milk tea after class. One thing I love about this place is the people who work there: Friendly, but no bull. Just get in and get out. It's exactly what i'm looking for. To be honest, I'm not typically the type of person that would sit down for an extended period of time at a cafe, and this place probably isn't great for those people who do. I would definitely stop by on a date with my girl, grab a drink and get out, but I wouldn't want to take someone that I just met here to sit down and get to know someone. That being said, the vibe of the place is cute. I miss the wall post-it notes, but honestly Tea Swirl is the place to go for a quick great tasting drink."}
{"text":"I've got no complaints! This is a solid $5 cup of boba.   The Boba is tasty, the tea taste fresh... And the service was very friendly! I brought my daughter in at one month old and they were very receptive to her... Very family oriented."}
{"text":"Great quality tea in a humble space. A bit overpriced but they do cater to specific requests like sugar and ice content. The staff is quite friendly and the tea used for the drinks seems to be genuine, minus the honeydew and taro powders. But you can truly taste the difference in their regular milk teas and be certain they don't skimp on quality!"}
{"text":"Great tea after you figure out what you like. The first time I came here I was beyond confused and had no idea what to order, but I've discovered that the assam milk tea with 50% sweetness and boba is perfectly up my alley. Worth a stop!"}
{"text":"Idk about this place.. this is my second time here.. and they misled or made a mistake on my order each time.. and they don't offer to replace or fix it. Probably be my last time here.. the first time I was here and I got the oolong milk tea and then at asked them what would they recommend and they said \" the house special\" so I got it. Upon receiving both my drinks they told me it's the same thing.. like seriously? Why didn't you tell me that before ordering? The tea was good but I'm done because the same thing just happened. I asked if they had regular boba milk tea so I that.. but I wanted to try something new and I tried the early grey milk tea .. it turned out to be the same thing.. they need to advertise and better word their product. I'm done with this place. Only come here cause it's close to my church but I rather go somewhere closer to home now.   Wish the workers would be knowledgeable and help the customer and not laugh at me when I order the same thing because it is an honest mistake."}
{"text":"Found out that this place accommodates for those who are vegan or lactose intolerant! I love that! I always get the Thai tea. Delicious! The service quick and friendly too :)"}
{"text":"This is a quaint spot located near ASU. I am always satisfied when I go here and they are very consistent. This is not the best boba spot I've been too but I go back for one main reason. Their brown sugar boba is awesome and nobody in this state has it down like them. This spot can get packed very quickly because it's small so my girl and I always take it to go.  The staff is super nice and are laid back people. I love that they give you levels of how sweet you want your drink."}
{"text":"I've only tried their house milk tea and I really liked it. Their tea has a nice floral taste. The decor is also very cute and simple."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and the staff was extremely helpful in helping me choose a delicious tea! I had just finish lunch so unfortunately i was too full to get boba but I went for the Mango Lychee tea with Lychee jelly!! I can't wait to go back and try their slush, milk teas, and add some boba!! So happy this little shop has opened near my work for a perfect refreshing lunch time drink/snack"}
{"text":"I live in Northern California but was visiting my sister in Tempe over Christmas break. The place has nice interiors and an elaborate menu.   Will recommend the Jasmine Green Milk Tea!   Great place and the staff is nice!! They have a huge choice for Jelly- including Mango and Passion Fruit which is amazing!"}
{"text":"I love my boba and I love trying new combinations.  Tea swirl makes that easy because they have some of the most creative combinations I've seen.  That and the perfect boba I am hooked."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the house milk tea with boba and the galaxy swirl with lychee jelly. Every time i've gone the tea and boba have always tasted great."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with boba lately and this place is one of the best. It's completely customizable - you pick your tea flavor, cream, add ons (boba, pudding, jelly etc.), even ice and \"sweetness\" level. Today I got the galaxy, but usually I get the taro with black and white boba (it tastes like sugar cookies!) The service is great, it's fast, and the drinks are delicious. Their loyalty program is also great, and they offer great rewards and incentives. Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"I love earl grey milk tea here. It is creamy and fresh. I like Tea Swirl because it seems like they brew real tea here, unlike other places where they use powder. The price isn't cheap but with the size of the drink you are getting, I guess it isn't so bad. Everytime I'm in Tempe, this is a place I get my boba tea fix."}
{"text":"Overhyped. I went here because my Instagram was buzzing it about it. The cool drinks were the carbonated colored drinks. It looks pretty but its taste were average. I'd rather by a sprite and add flavoring myself.  While the decor was really cute, if you are going for drinks, there are better boba or soda shops around"}
{"text":"The House Swirl Milk Tea is a delicious fragrant oolong milk tea, not the usual black milk tea, as expected, and I loved it! I arrived just as they opened, and needed to wait a few minutes for the boba to be ready, so I ordered my tea first and they brought the boba out on the side later! Tried both the dark and the white boba, as I've never had white boba before...I think I like the flavor of the dark boba better (although the white boba was pretty!)"}
{"text":"I went in yesterday not having a clue what I wanted to drink. I just really wanted some jellies...random, I know. Anyways, I ended up having such a great experience. There were three staff members working, two girls and one guy.     The male took my order and I said I wanted something fruity. Super bland description. He ended up going above and beyond and making his own concoction. I wasn't really loving it so he said no worries and he remade something else. All of us ended up testing out different variations until we found the perfect recipe. It was just fun to laugh with the staff and customer satisfaction was definitely their priority.     I ended up leaving with two customized teas and they were so delicious! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Finally authentic Taiwanese boba in Tempe, maybe all of AZ. Authentic milk tea, delicious boba, great tea and a perfect place to stay and chat with friends."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Almost a 4 star rating if my hot tea came out hot rather than just warm. Nonetheless, you can tell this place brews real tea and none of the milk tea is from a powder mix. The store is very clean. I would visit again to try other drinks and perhaps bump up the rating."}
{"text":"I love Tea Swirl! Wish they had Thai Tea. Their black boba is A LOT smaller than regular black boba - keep that in mind. I might have accidentally choking on a few because of how small they are. LOL. Overall, would come back again.  Pretty pricey though."}
{"text":"Depend on the day that you can see different faces who taking order with friendly smile or having a bad day face's. Adding level percentage of sugar could be different every time = inconsistent taste"}
{"text":"I was craving tea and found this place.  I wanted Jasmine tea, but they seemed to only have Jasmine green tea. It was a little bitter for me but wasn't bad.  Lots of seating and nice staff. Service was good."}
{"text":"Cute small little milk tea/boba cafe located close to ASU. The store has small little benches and tables to sit at to bring in your laptop and just chill, do homework, or just kill time (like me).   They had the wifi password written really small in someones handwriting in the front of the register which is kind of inconvenient as i had to cut a bunch of people in line to just take a quick picture.  The little white chairs were really loud when u scooted out which brought alot of attention to me and i wished for a second they didnt have them lol.    When I made my order there was an option to tip.....(?) I was kind of confused because they arent servers..... if one of you workers reads this review and your paycheck actually relies on customers tips, lmk because if not... like wtf LOL.   and I ordered the house swirl with boba which tasted pretty good. 4 stars for the actual drink, 2-3 stars on atmosphere, decoration, and overall vibe."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Love all the employees and the tea is to die for! 5 stars!! keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"The boba is very fresh tasting. The staff is super nice and the best part is you can choose your sweetness level! A lot of times boba tea is too sweet but the 50% sweet earl grey tea tasted perfect."}
{"text":"Too pretty to drink!  It was a scorching 100 degrees outside and I needed a cup of boba to refuel. Came here on a whim and got the Galaxy Swirl and the Mango Lychee Green Tea, both with lychee jellies. They were too pretty to drink! But of course, I gulped it all until not a single jelly was left in the cup. Service was quick and friendly. The girl at the register actually recommended the Galaxy Swirl, saying that it was her favorite. So I fell for it, and I'm glad I did! It tasted like Go-Gurt, the yogurt that's squeezed out of the tube instead of being eaten with a spoon. Brownie points if you know what I'm talking about! Anyways, it tasted just like that, but in boba form. As for the Mango Lychee Green Tea it was super refreshing, especially on a hot summer day. They were also generous with the lychee jellies. I think they filled up like a third-half of the cup in jellies. It did take them some time to bring out the beverages, however. There wasn't a line or anything but I guess it's time consuming to layer the different colors in the drink? Nonetheless, it was worth the wait. Also, feel free to customize your drink and let them know how much ice/sugar you'd like in your drink. I'll come back fasho, the next time I'm around the area."}
{"text":"The drinks and boba are a solid 3.0 for me, but service was definitely a 5.0. I'm going to choose a happy medium and go with a 4.0.   I went by with my friends on a random afternoon to get my boba fix of the day. The menu was somewhat confusing since it didn't have any descriptions for some of the special drinks. However, the cashier was very thorough about explaining the various drinks to me. I ended up getting an okinawa milk tea with brown sugar boba and my friends had the okinawa milk tea with pudding and the mango lychee green tea with black boba. I'm extremely glad that the cashier warned me about how sweet the okinawa can be at full sweetness. She gave me a sample of the 50% okinawa so that I could adjust the sweetness accordingly. I ended up with 50% sweetness and my friend chose to get his okinawa with 20% sweetness. So, flavor-wise, I may have just chosen the wrong drink. The okinawa milk tea was extremely sweet and rich and almost seemed to have a buttery undertone. Halfway through the drink, I started feeling somewhat queasy and definitely had to slow down. My friend felt the same way about the okinawa as well. My other friend seemed to love her mango lychee green tea and had no complaints there. The brown sugar boba was good, but somewhat tough and hard rather than chewy.   Overall, it's a cute place where you can get a variety of different drinks. However, boba/tea wise, I'll have to give it a 3.0."}
{"text":"Tea Swirl has legitimate California Milk Tea. I've tried at least 5 tea bars in Arizona and none of them come close to tea swirl. The only reason I rate them 3 stars is because they are so inconsistent! I expect consistency for a $5 drink. I get the same thing everytime: Assam milk tea, half ice, 50% sweetness, with brown sugar boba. But sometimes my whole cup is ice, the boba is stale, the tea is too sweet or not sweet enough. Once my boyfriend got a 80% sweetness tea and I got 50% but his tea was less sweet than mine. Maybe the managers need to put a chart up explaining how to create the drink consistently. It seems like each employee has their own way of making their drinks."}
{"text":"This joint is a hit or miss with boba. Sometimes it's made fresh with the perfect amount of sweetness (at least for my standard of boba) and sometimes it tastes a day old with no sweetness added. Aside from the boba, the drinks are pretty good! My favorites to get are the milk teas and the cremas!! I have tried the Rising Phoenix and although I love sweet things, that drink was a little too sweet for my taste and I had to add water when I drank a little bit of it! The customer service is wonderful and I love how the workers are willing to educate you on their menu even with a line forming. Tea Swirl is very close to campus and has my vote ~ give them a try and see what you think!!"}
{"text":"Okay people, this is one of the only milk tea shops that I frequent here in Arizona. The tea tastes fresh every time and you have control of how sweet your drink is along with how much ice. My absolute go to is the jasmine crema 80% sweet with half ice. That's it, no added toppings. Delicious and refreshing. Give it a try and don't look back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately one of the worst milk tea places I've been to in a long time. I came once and tried the Assam Creama, couldn't make up my mind if I liked it or not, came back a second time and sampled three drinks, and ended up disliking them all.   Tea Swirl is a cute little milk tea spot located in a strip mall with a good amount of parking. I found it interesting that most of the menu was in Chinese, but there are english translations on the main electronic menus in front of the cashier. There's a variety of milk teas, slushies, creamas, and lattes. Service was pretty friendly and quick both times.  Assam creama: The creamas come with tea on the bottom and a layer of semi-salty cream on top. I found the assam tea decently strong, although the creama on top was a little strange. It literally tasted like salty dense whipped cream, which I couldn't decide if I liked or not. I've had many creamas at other milk tea places with differing levels of saltiness, but this was particularly strong and salty. When I mixed the tea and cream, the saltiness was still pretty evident.   Jasmine milk tea: This was probably the worst rendition of jasmine milk tea I've had in the past decade. The jasmine was really watered down, and the powdery taste was so strong I only took two sips before tossing the entire drink. I appreciate that the powder is dairy-free, but I honestly would've preferred the side effects of dairy to the powder. Would absolutely not recommend.  Okinawa milk tea: Super artificially flavored, this drink tasted like syrup and milk. It was pretty sweet even at 50% sugar, and though I couldn't taste the powder, the artificial syrup was almost equally as bad.  Matcha latte with brown sugar pearls: My friend loved the brown sugar pearls, but I personally found them overly sweet and rubbery. I don't know whether they'd been soaked in brown sugar syrup or cooked in brown sugar water, but the taste of brown sugar was pretty evident. I guess they would be good if you didn't mind the sweetness, but I felt like I was chewing on sugar gummies that had been sitting out for a while. The matcha was really watered down, to the point where I could see through the liquid (even with the milk mixed in). I've made better matcha lattes at home, and this was definitely not worth it.   I think Tea Swirl has the best intentions, but their products fall short. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I had the galaxy swirl... which was described as a mocktail. I'm not really sure what's in it but it tasted good and looked really pretty. LIKE A GALAXY! I also had jelly with it too which came up to a total of $6 after you check in on Yelp. They seem to have a lot of variety on the menu and fast service, but the store does get crowded in there when it's busy. I was there on Friday night and there was a huge line. In addition to that, there's very little seating, however, there is a small room in the back where you can sit. I also like that you can have dinner at Sushi 101 or Asian Fusion Cafe beforehand since it's right next door and then you can come get some boba tea afterward. It's a good hangout spot!   Next time, I'm looking forward to try the Okinawan Milk Tea."}
{"text":"I love love love Tea Swirl but I wish they opened at 11am or 11:30am instead of noon :( I recommended the Honey Earl Grey Milk Tea with brown sugar boba.  I used to get original jelly but they took it off the menu since it tasted too similar to lychee unfortunately.  I hope they bring it back!"}
{"text":"Best boba in town hands down. Try their Taro milk tea with crema,brown sugar boba and honey. That brown sugar boba has me addicted"}
{"text":"I really wanted boba last minute so I decided to try this place since I was near campus. I ordered the Okinawa milk tea, 50% sugar, with brown sugar boba. This was so disgustingly sweet that I couldn't finish half of it. It also didn't taste like Okinawa milk tea. The boba in my cup was heavily clumped together and very mushy. The only upside was the boba taste was on point. I won't be going back here for a $5 cup of disappointment."}
{"text":"This place is very cute and the boba tea is great. We got there at 8pm and they were out of boba but the lady was very sweet about. She let us know there would be more in 15 min and offered to let us sample other forms of boba available. They only have one size drink available which is a bit large than what I normally like but the price is decent. The atmosphere is very modern and simple. I had the spirit wintermelon milk tea and it was very good."}
{"text":"Coming from California, it's hard  in Phoenix finding boba spots that serve real tea and not the powder crap. I really appreciate this place for the tea, environment, and the service. Ting ( the owner) was amazingly kind and helpful. We asked about Rose tea knowing that they didn't have it on the menu, AND HE MADE IT FOR US. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"I got the jasmine tea half iced 20% sugar. I cannot say I loved this placed but will probably go back after yoga at Sumits. They offer a ton of options and concoctions so will have to give it another go."}
{"text":"A lot of options for drinks! Love that you can choose your sweetness level, and ice level."}
{"text":"One of the baristas, Tori, was awesome. I called with a few questions about caffeine content and about how long boba lasts (because it was late & I wanted to get a drink for tomorrow morning). She was genuine, sounded happy to help, and she gave me honest information. I'm pretty sure it was her willingness to answer my questions and her friendliness that brought me in tonight. She ended up being the person to take my order and her sweet personality made my second visit to Tea Swirl especially pleasant.   Having a great product with just enough options is one thing that Tea Swirl does well, but what really makes this place stellar is the customer service.   I ordered the jasmine milk tea half sweet with boba and it came out just right.   I'd have to agree with the statement I saw in another review: Tea Swirl is the best boba in Tempe."}
{"text":"Tea Swirl is a cool lil Boba Tea joint that is located by the ASU campus. The staff that run the place are all very friendly, and helpful in decision making if you don't know what you want. I'm so happy to find Boba growing in popularity in Phoenix... But this place is especially unique as they use Taiwanese style methods.   My friend really liked her Lychee soda-like drink... I forgot the name. And the boba in my  son and my drinks were tasty and perfectly cooked.  Make sure you pickup their frequent flyer stamp card.   (Tina was especially nice, and Allen? was really helpful!)   Might see ya there!"}
{"text":"My roommates brought me to check out this new boba place. So glad I did! The staff was very helpful and kind with their suggestions. I am lactose intolerant and they were all knowledgeable about the fact that their milk teas do not contain lactose. (And they will soon be getting almond milk.) I ordered the taro half sweetened with brown sugar boba. It was the best boba drink I've had! I would definitely recommend getting your drink half sweetened or even 25% sweetened because it was perfect. I can't wait to be back to try other flavors!"}
{"text":"If you know me, you know I'm a huge fan of bubble tea. I definitely recommend checking out Tea Swirl by ASU. I got winter melon swirl with brown sugar mini boba, and my fiancé got the Galaxy Swirl (like a soda) with lychee jelly. The customer service was great. They made samples for us, and really helped us with the ordering process. I love how custom you can make your drink here. Major plus: they have lactose free milk tea!! Yayyyyy! I can't wait to come back to try their other flavors like taro, Okinawa and Jasmine tea."}
{"text":"My favourite place for boba. I live 30min away from the shop, but will only go here for my jasmine milk tea with crystal boba. I've tried at many different boba location, but this is by far the best...!!!"}
{"text":"You should add food such as crepes. That would be quite a high selling point. Over all every time I go here the service is great!"}
{"text":"I'm new to this whole boba thing still but coming in I was greeted & welcomed instantly! I was lost on how to order but one of the girls was guiding me and even offered me samples and walked me through the whole process. They take their time making the boba because it's more natural compared to regular \"fast\" boba places. She explained so much and I'll definitely be coming here more often for my boba!"}
{"text":"Came back to try a different drink and was served powdery milk tea. Won't be back again."}
{"text":"Little boba treasures, get in mah belly!  I really like this place! I've been to some shops and so far this place really holds up as a great boba tea shop not far from where I live. You can pick different levels of sweetness, ice, boba, etc. and I really like that!  I usually get an Earl Gray Milk Tea, they use non-dairy creamer as their milk base, no ice, with boba, and 50% sweet. I've yet to try the others since it tastes so good, but eventually I'll have to so I don't get bored with my usual.  The only thing that kinda hurts about this place being so centrally near ASU, is that when there's a game, the entire intersection AND the parking lot where the shop is located turns into a congested parking lot... oh well, this won't deter me from getting boba when I'm craving it!"}
{"text":"We got a little tired after a long walk in Tempe Beach Park and Mill Ave so we decided to get some tea to refresh ourselves. I am beyond impressed by this tea shop! Overall, the shop was very chill with plenty of seats to hangout. We ordered a House Oolong Swirl with grass jelly and a peach green tea with crema. You can choose the ice and sugar level to your liking as well as any toppings offered. The tea was super flavorful and the level of sweetness and ice was as requested. We saw the owner took out its new drink called Galaxy. It looked super cool because it was an array of colors, turning from blue to purple and then red. Out of curiosity I asked the owner about the drink and how he was able to achieve such a cool looking drink. He was super nice and explained that it was due to he PH level of the ingredients that he used. The drink on display was pomegranate flavored. He was nice enough to offer us a Galaxy to try! He creates one raspberry and one lychee flavor for us. It was delicious! Although this was a little sweeter than how I would like it since I always get 50% sugar, I still liked it a lot! It tasted like cotton candy or a popsicle! All refreshed from the drinks, and ready for a long drive back!"}
{"text":"Okay, every time I'm in Tempe, I stop by here before my hour drive home. I always get the earl grey milk tea, and you can set your sweetness and ice level. My drink is always amazing!  They are all friendly, very flexible. Their boba is really good. Sometimes boba places have mushy boba, but not this place! I've been here 4 or 5 times, and their boba have been amazing every time.  Yay for Tea Swirl! I love milk tea!"}
{"text":"Finally, a shop near ASU that sells authentic Taiwanese boba milk tea for a reasonable price! The other places selling boba near campus either depend too heavily on powder or don't have the flavor of milk tea down and are too pricey. From what I could see, the tea is brewed in advance, but makes for convenient and quick service. I ordered the House Swirl Milk Tea and the Earl Grey Swirl Milk Tea with 100% sweetness. Compared to another shop across town, their earl grey milk tea tasted more like earl grey, which I appreciate them getting the flavor correct.  The customer service is perfect. The man behind the counter was polite and very helpful in making my orders. I received my first drink from behind the counter, but for my second drink, he delivered it to the table I was sitting at.  They don't have much for decoration/ambience, but I won't hold that against them because they are brand new, they excel in their drinks, and there is plenty of seating. I saw that they used a powder mix for their Taro Swirl Milk Tea, but I'm willing to excuse that because apart from Okinawa Milk Tea, those are the only two drinks using powder and because it's difficult to make taro milk tea using fresh taro. They also did not have boba today, but that's okay for me because I don't normally order boba in my drinks due to my braces. This place is entirely worth the walk."}
{"text":"A decent place to get your bubble tea fix. Everything was great. The service  was friendly and quick. Make sure you sign up for their rewards program. It's an all digital program so give them your cell phone number.   The one thing I do wish they offered more of is their slush. I do hope they develop more flavors for their bubble tea slush. Besides that one thing, I give this place two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Updating review - their boba has changed, there's no more mini bobas. :( I'm switching this from 5 to 4 stars, because the last two times I've been there, their boba has not been as flavorful with brown sugar as before. The boba here was definitely my favorite but not anymore. Hopefully it'll be back!    I try to come here as much as I can, if I am ever remotely close to the area! Let me tell you why I love this place: 1. they have amaaaazing customer service - they're always happy here, and are so so very helpful to me because I'm always confused on what to order here! 2. They have THE BEST MINI BOBAS here in PHX. Not sure how they do it, but I just love that brown sugar all soaked up in those balls! haha. The only reason why I don't come to this place is because it's far from where I work in Chandler. *sad face* But my sister also loves this place, so whenever she's here, she brings me some! :D There has been a time where she came in here to get some boba for me right when they opened, but the boba wasn't ready yet so she had to wait for it to finish cooking. So don't come right when they're opened if you're here for the boba just as much as I am! So I've ordered many drinks here, many that I don't remember since I take allll their recommendations. The staff knows their tea, and the background of it all so it helps me to not have to choose and I just take whatever they give me. haha. The most recent drink I had was the Assam crema with mini boba and with 50% sugar. I'm not a super sweet drinker, so I usually order my drinks with 50% or even 25% depending on the place. It was a good drink and had caffeine in it, I shook the tea for the cream to mix. Next time, I think I'll just have them not cover the top because I like to sip on my tea. All in all, I love their set up, is clean and simple. And will definitely recommend this place and the staff's recommendations if you're not sure what to order!"}
{"text":"With so many boba tea places in the valley, the competition is fierce and one bad impression can be costly. I decided to stop by here and try them out. Walking in, there's a few tables in the front and the counter with additional seating along the back in a long, narrow space. Perusing the menu, I went with my standard Thai tea latte with less ice and black boba. I requested 80% sugar but the guy said it comes on the sweet side and they don't recommend more than 50%, so I changed my order.  Price was on the higher (typical) side, it was almost $5 with tax.  When I tried poking my straw in the cup, it was blocked by the large ice cubes. Once I tried it, it was hardly sweet, and there was way too much ice in it. After a few minutes, there was no flavor left and it tasted watered down. The boba pearls were fine, that was the only redeeming quality. Not sure if I got a bad batch, but it seems like almost everything was done wrong so I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The best things at Tea Swirl are the real tea and the customer can choose the % of their drink sweetness. The tea here is excellent and I can taste the brewed tea. I love all of their milk tea especially Assam and Earl Grey. The crema swirl is also delicious. It reminded me of Thai sweet dessert that we put coconut cream on top. For matcha lover, the matcha latte is good. I order them with either boba or grass jelly, and 20% sweet."}
{"text":"While slightly expensive at 5$ for milk tea with boba, the drinks here are honestly some of the best milk teas you can get in Phoenix. My favorites when I go here are the Okinawa and Assam teas, which both have a great bittersweet coffee taste that I love. Just a word of caution -- their sweetness levels scale super fast;  go for lower sweetness levels when you order or it will be much too sweet!"}
{"text":"Delicious , great selection , obsessed with their spirit milk tea , I love how you can choose the amount of sweetness you'd like"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I'm not a huge fan of boba tea. The service has been good and friendly here, but the workers don't seem to be incredibly educated as when I asked about ingredients in different drinks they did not know. The environment could definitely be more comfortable. There's only a few chairs and tables and they are all hard and not cushioned.  This place does not really have any healthy options unless you like plain unsweet tea. I got an iced black jasmine tea which tasted a little burnt and bitter. They don't carry any real fruit, just artificial fruit syrups to add to your drink."}
{"text":"Trendy boba tea spot near ASU.  When I have stopped in I believe I have always been the only non college student.  Staff is friendly and helpful when I have sought out recommendations for different boba tea options.  My favorite is the jasmine milk tea, regular ice, 50% sweet with black boba.  It is delicious and not overly sweet as other boba teas I have tried."}
{"text":"Love the look of place but the music is loud and the lighting is very dim. I liked the fact that there was free wifi and power cord plugs for customers to chill and hang out. Perfect for being by college but the loud music might be an interference. Not really a fan of the cashier because I received an attitude when I asked about certain drinks. The line can get long so beware. Order comes out quickly though so that's a perk. Overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"First off, this is reflective of Tea Swirl's recent visits.  When they first opened, there was consistently good boba- honey or brown sugar, every time I went the tea and boba were amazingly good and I would drive the 20 minutes there with no hesitation.     However the visits in the last month have been disappointing.  I would come twice a week because I craved it and sometimes this would be after work about 8:30 and other times early, around 8:30 I would come and order a tea with brown sugar boba- really I was ordering tea with stale ass boba.  The brown sugar boba used to be fresh and chewy and has perfectly absorbed the brown sugar, now it's hard most of the time or the soft boba never absorbs the brown sugar.  Also if I come a little late- about an hour before close- the employees aren't nice and treat you like a burden, PLEASE RETURN TO THE WAY YOU WERE WHEN YOU FIRST OPENED, always CONSISTENTLY GOOD, now it's like I get a good tea and boba combo one in every 5 visits"}
{"text":"Only my second time getting boba (or jelly) so really don't know what I'm doing as far as ordering.  The young lady at the counter was super helpful at answering my 50 questions and did great making recommendations.  She didn't make me feel stupid at all. I got the passion fruit tea 20% sweetness with pineapple jelly - yum!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Favorite boba place in the Phoenix valley hands down. Good boba. Always get the Okinawa Milk Tea, 0 sugar, half ice."}
{"text":"Delicious bobba tea. Amazing toppings! Love that they put a lot of toppings! Never dissapointed at this place! Amazing servicr as always! Love the house swirl milk tea and Okinawa"}
{"text":"Yummy teas. Came here twice so far. They have a lot of customization with their teas such as add-ins, ice amount, and sweetness.  There drinks are colorful too! Depending if you get the special house drinks or not. I have yet to try one as I usually go for my go to of peach green tea. Maybe I'll try one when I'm not rushed to make it for class so I have more time to look :)   The store itself is quite loud for me but I feel that's normal in these types of setting. Music prettttyy loud."}
{"text":"I visited here many times, but they always make me wrong drinks. Especially when I ordered to go, I couldn't exchange when I realized the drink was wrong. Will not come back again terrible experience"}
{"text":"This place has great boba! Trust me when I say, I'm a pro boba drinker. A must try! Yum"}
{"text":"Custom bubble tea! They offer a decent variety of flavors here, with the option for your level of ice, sweetness, and add-in. The shop is in the Tempe Improv plaza a few doors down from Asian Fusion Cafe. The actual space is very narrow, with a few areas of seating in the front, side, and back.   I went with the Okinawan milk tea with white boba, light ice and 50% sweetness. The Okinawan milk tea here, in addition to their taro milk teas, uses a powdered mix that they add water to. What makes this milk tea \"Okinawan\" is the use of brown sugar instead of syrup (I read that Okinawans make a special roasted brown sugar on the island). I think the 50% sweetness level was just right for me, and I loved the earthy undertones of the drink from the tea and roasted flavor of the sugar. As for mix ins, they offer boba and various jellies. The white boba I had was a plentiful amount in my drink, with a perfect chewiness and sweetness.  The menu isn't as extensive as other shops, but I do like what selections they do have. I also enjoy the simple fact that there is a bubble tea shop in Tempe now. I usually have to go to Chandler to get my bubble tea fix!"}
{"text":"Refreshing tea and service. Everyone here was so friendly and willing to give recommendations. I had the peach green tea with lychee jelly and it did not disappoint. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best boba I've had on the east side so far! White boba and coffee jelly were amazing! Loved the great service I received as a first time customer and really enjoyed my House Swirl Milk Tea!"}
{"text":"Love this place come here almost everyday, staff is awesome and boba is great, plus the owner is there all the time interacting with customers all the time, which makes it very personable. Great Experience"}
{"text":"To me, this is just another bubble tea cafe, but it does have a good location in that it's close to ASU Tempe.   So I ordered the classic bubble milk tea. It was like what one would expect from bubble milk tea. One thing that I do give major props for is the option to choose ice and sweetness level. Reminded me of the places in Taiwan. Puts me in control. The other places that I have been to does not have this option, so their drinks either are too sweet or not sweet enough, usually the former.   Anyway, I would come again if I was eating at Buffalo Wild Wings and wanted some dessert afterwards."}
{"text":"I always go here for the Okinawa Milk Tea! I get it with 20% sweetness and it's always on point with black boba or pudding when I feel like changing it up. The boba is never overly sticky, it has the right amount of chew and honey flavor. I've also tried the matcha as well, real tasty. Not the most amazing I've had but would order again if ever in the mood. Bonus points for all their milk teas being dairy free!  Tea Swirl is probably one of my favorite boba places in Phoenix. It's my definite go to whenever I get a craving for milk tea!"}
{"text":"Tea Swirl is one of the best Boba places I've tried in Arizona! I tried the Peach Mango Green Tea with lychee jelly and aloe. It was absolutely delicious!   They have so many customization options like ice level, sweetness level and a large variety of jelly toppings! The workers were very nice and I got my drink super quickly! I definitely recommend coming here with friends for friendly service and delicious boba drinks!"}
{"text":"Cool new place in Tempe go get some boba! We tried 4 drinks over there, the Galaxy tea, a taro smoothie, and a earl grey tea! I overheard this place from some friends of mine and how it was getting trendy in Tempe.   The reason why I'm rating this 3 stars is because only their tea was good! The taro smoothie was powder made. It was very icy too, so the proportions of ice was kinda off. The Galaxy swirl was COOL to take a picture of, but as for the taste. It was nothing that special. It tasted like ice cream sherbet, and the carbonation of the drink kinda tasted like a flat soda.   The tea was good though! We had the Earl Grey tea and the Jasmine tea. Very flavorful, not overly sweet, and very refreshing. The only thing that threw me off was that the earl grey tea looks exactly the jasmine tea. You would think that it has a \"grey-ish\" color to it, maybe I'm wrong.   So I feel like Tea Swirl is only good for \"milk tea\" drinks. The smoothies were not so good, and you can definitely go somewhere else for a lot more flavor options and a lot better quality smoothie. The Galaxy Tea Swirl is trendy and looks cool to snapchat or post online, but the taste is alright."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Boba Tea spots! Never disappointed and the people are so helpful, friendly and kind! There are so many options when it comes to customizing your drink. Definitely will keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place has a wide variety of boba flavors. It's one of the better places I've been to for boba within the Tempe area. Any bubble tea I've tried there has been really good. There's some seating available but every time I'm there, it's pretty busy. Regardless, the service is quick."}
{"text":"Finally! Legit boba near me! As a California grown 626 (San Gabriel Valley yes we use area codes) kid this is my dream come true.  Moved to Arizona for 3 years now and we would have to binge when we got home.. no more !   Favorites:  I prefer the black boba over the white, slight texture difference from a boba eating veteran but TBH I'm just super picky cause I've had tried SOOOO many.    I stick to the basics like jasmine green milk tea and house milk tea.  Both good but jasmines my #1.    Okinawa milk tea is very interesting kind of like captain crunch soaked milk... I personally am not a fan because I don't have a sweet tooth but if you love sweets this drink is for you.    My Typical Order: Jasmine Green Milk Tea + Black Boba + Pudding  My sister in law, husband, and I come weekly. :)"}
{"text":"Best boba in Tempe?   If not definitely a contender for that spot. Tasty flavorful tea with perfectly chewy boba mixed in. Staff is friendly and while the location is a bit tucked away this place is the real deal. I got the house milk tea with white boba and 20% sugar and it was made perfect! The ability to control your sugar/ice is a nice touch and the menu has a lot of varieties to choose from.   Judging by the signage and the dual language menu the owners are Taiwanese (edited) and the boba they serve up is top notch. (Tea itself is quality stuff without the boba!)   Price is reasonable around $3.75-$4.50 on average so I don't think the price is high as Demi said. I like the minimal interior decor as well.  Super happy that a legit boba place is in Tempe and so close to my office!!! Yayayay."}
{"text":"Great tea-based selections that you are unique to Tea Swirl. I love the fact they let you choose the amount of sweetness and ice up front and the staff are knowledgeable about how it will affect your drink. I really enjoyed the taro milk tea and the mango lychee green tea both times I was there, The taro was milky and didn't have that powdery feel that Taro flavored drinks sometimes has and I really enjoyed the hint of lavender that came through. The mango lychee green tea wasn't too sweet either, which I like, thanks to the cashier recommended me to get 20% sweet instead of the 50% I asked for, and assured me that they will sweeten it more if needed. The only qualm my bf had was that they didn't let him add boba to his lychee swirl, because it is a preset drink."}
{"text":"Great addition to the milk tea scene in AZ.  Bringing traditional blends together with hybrid styles and flavors.  They are raising the bar for specialty drinks and boba.  Like the Taiwanese places back home you can select your preferred level of ice, sweetness and topping per drink. It's in a good spot relative to ASU and has lots of parking. Try the house blend or Okinawan milk tea!"}
{"text":"Stopped by one afternoon to kill some time before meeting up with some friends. First of all, the setting is very cute and well put together. There were plenty of tables and stools to gather. Also noted a little table in the back with a reserved sign, I'm thinking for study groups/mtgs. Love the cute post it wall.   Moving onto our drinks - I had the jasmine crema w/ lychee jelly at 20% sweetness. SO had the Blackforest tea w/ brown sugar boba at 20%. Let me preface w/ I'm a long time milk tea/Asian tea drinker being from California....SO is a newbie when it comes to milk tea/boba. I really enjoyed the crema and jasmine, but SO thought it was too \" flowery.\" The lychee jelly was ace. I did not regret my drink order at all. The blackforest tea on the other hand... was way too sweet. My 20% sweetness was perfect. The BFT 20% was a bit nauseating.... unfortunately. The boba was nice and chewy.   Overall, I enjoyed my visit. I've had a lot of good boba and a lot of baaaad boba in the past. Tea Swirl is one of the good ones for sure. Will be back when in the area!"}
{"text":"Walked in and sampled the difference between honey and brown sugar boba, the lady who helped me was very helpful and informative. The boba was so fresh, soft, warm, and chewy. I thought I was about to enjoy some great milk tea with brown sugar boba and coffee jelly. So I took the drinks (I bought 3) to my car, 5 mins later, I had my first sip.  The boba was horrible! The milk tea was good, coffee jelly was yum, but the boba was very hard and OLD!  What happened? Did they give me old boba different than the ones they gave me for sample? Im so mad to myself why I didnt take my first sip when I was still there. I couldve asked them to change it with the fresh ones. Im sitting here in my car staring at my full-cup drink but I cant even drink it. What a waste! I feel being cheated!!! Tea Swirl, you cannot serve old boba period. It's wrong!"}
{"text":"Definitely excited that there's a new boba place in AZ! First time I went, my friend and I got the Okinawa and Earl Grey Milk Tea. Okinawa was great and the Earl Grey wasn't terrible, but I'd get the Okinawa over it any time.   P.S- one of the reviews on Yelp said they had Hokkaido Milk Tea, but when I went there in Sep 2016, they do not have it :( I hope they add that to their menu!  Starting to love places that use \"Five Stars\" as their little promotion, since they often will send you 10% off drinks just cause.  I just wish it was a little closer to where I live, but I'll def be going often!"}
{"text":"First off, my original impression of tea swirl was good because I really liked the simple design of the store. The teas on the other hand, were also soooo good. The best that I've had in the valley. I've lived in Taiwan before and know what authentic, good bubble tea tastes like and this is the real deal! Just like in Taiwan, you can customize the amount of sweetness and ice you want in your drink.   My bf and I ordered milk tea and passion fruit green tea with lychee jelly. We ordered half sweet on both drinks which was the perfect amount of sweetness *for us. I've probably been back 3 times and they've only been open for almost 2 weeks now.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"So dang good!  Okinawa Milk Tea with White Boba & Jade Tea Crema with Black Boba  Drink taste is consistent. Must try if you're a boba fan! Yummmy!!!"}
{"text":"The blue angel is the most disgusting drink in the world. Taste like vinegar. DO NOT GET IT! (unless you wanna prank a friend and watch them suffer)  Atmosphere: 4 Blue Angel: 1"}
{"text":"The boba was okay. Not the best I've had, and I was expecting better considering the reviews. I ordered a taro slush with black boba. It tasted very watered down. The shop is really cute, though! Will still come back and try more of the signature drinks."}
{"text":"I have been eyeing this place for months! So glad it finally opened. This is in the same plaza as Einstein Bros and across from Raising Canes.  The service i received today was top notch! To be honest when i just heard the name I had my doubts. Was this going to be another boba place fail with watered down drinks? *cough* the blend *cough.But i was pleasantly surprised! Their tops drinks are hokkaido milk tea & house swirl which is oolong milk tea. They let you customize sweet level and how much  ice. Its an asian thing to not have too much ice.  I havent had hokkaido since forever so I tried it with white boba. The white boba was perfectly soft and chewy. Hokkaido milk tea was still too sweet at 50 bit tasted like a light custard flavor. Next time i will get house swirl or jasmine creama. This place gets best boba in the valley! Keep it up guys.   Tip: You get 15% off with yelp check in."}
{"text":"This place has a great selection of teas to choose from, and the boba is just as good as the ones we have in L.A.  The owner is from Taiwan, the birthplace of boba, so he definitely knows his boba.  This place even let you customize the amount of ice and the level of sweetness for your drink just so you can have your perfect cup of tea.  If you have not tried this place, you should definitely give it a try.  Did I mention that you also get great services?"}
{"text":"A great start to my soon to be boba tea tour of AZ.   There is so much to like about this place I don't even know where to begin. I guess I'll start with the interior... very modern and minimal vibe. It's a clean, open space that makes hanging out and enjoying your drink a relaxing experience. There were a few other customers but it was chill and plenty of seating. Granted, I came in on a Sunday around 2pm and I'm not sure if ASU was on break or not.. I could see this place being packed when campus is full.   The employees were not only friendly but willing to help two of us order, answer any questions, provide recommendations and also gave us samples not only of tea but of the different jellys.   Once we settled on our drinks (Assam milk tea with brown sugar boba and a Blue Angel with pineapple jelly) I found that with my tea I got to chose my ice level (regular, half or none), my sugar level (0%, 20%, 50%, 80% and 100%) and a choice of black, white or brown sugar boba. I had never tried brown sugar but they tasted a little better than black boba. I also got 50% sugar and loved the option.   I will without a doubt be returning and recommend this place. Can't wait to try other options."}
{"text":"Great service very patient explaining options. Some interesting combinations compared to other milk tea places. Got a jasmine milk tea double crema with white boba @ 50% sugar - tasty but not too sweet. I'd come here again. Only negative not a lot of seating in the front entrance area."}
{"text":"Love love this place! I've been coming here for almost a year and each time I visit my experience is nothing but great. The service is always fast (even when there is a line), the drinks are amazing, employees and super nice and helpful with any questions you might have. They have a good amount of seating which is nice since the place isn't too big, free WiFi (which everyone loves of course) and a rewards program with FiveStars which is great if you come here often! I definitely will be coming back here when I'm in need of a refreshing drink!"}
{"text":"I'm never on the east side so why not try this boba place. My first impression is why is there only two chairs at each table. There were four of us. So My two friends had to stand. It was awkward so we just left.  ummm.  They didn't have a bathroom?! Weird.   My mango boba slush was good. I liked it. It wasn't too sweet it too bland.   The galaxy looks better than it looks. :/   The lychee swirl was super sweet. I felt like I took a sip of sugar. It was not my favorite.   Overall. I'll come back... for the mango boba :)"}
{"text":"I've found my new favorite drink. House black tea with grass jelly at 20% sweetness and half ice. The amount of sweetness and caffeine is a perfect pick me up for the mid-afternoon. The grass jelly adds an interesting texture without being too disruptive to the taste of the tea.   Service: Excellent. I've been here twice and have been treated well each time.   Drinks: the first time I was here, I ordered the Earl Grey crema with pudding. Pudding is one of my favorite treats for bubble tea. The crema though was overwhelming. The first few sips were decadent- I could feel the cream saltiness rolling over my tongue. But I couldn't finish the drink. It was just too much. Perhaps if I'd gotten a sweeter drink it would have tasted like melted ice cream. But in an effort to not get diabetes, I stuck with the 20%. I would not recommend this.   Today's drink, however, was what I look for when I go for bubble tea. I'd come back here.   Ambiance: I'm fond of the back of the cafe. There's a long wooden table that would be great for catching up with a friend or for studying. I imagine the music would be a little too loud for such activities in the front of the building.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a really cool tea place! I got delicious milk tea and boba. Everyone is really friendly who works there too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend got the Earl Grey milk tea and I got the jasmine green tea milk tea, with two scoops of boba. We enjoyed both! I got mine %20 sweet which was perfect! He got %50 sweet which was good, but did take away from the Earl Grey flavor. The staff was very helpful! The inside is cute, modern, hip. Pretty big space. They even had a sample of their spirit tea. I love when places offer samples and the workers are super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is always popping! Very popular choice for ASU students, they offer free WiFi and have a room with a long table, perfect for group projects. Side note: the WiFi is spotty, especially if there are a lot of people using it! The space is rather small, but utilized very well. Cute, simple decor, can be a little tight between tables, especially if you have a lot of books, laptops, or people with you.   The staff is friendly and helpful and very fast at making drinks! I chose an Oolong Tea Latte with boba, regular ice, at 50% sweet. The drink had a very strong and delicious tea flavor, I needed a caffeine boost so this was perfect. I didn't know there was such a thing as brown sugar boba (is all boba that???) Maybe I never noticed before...it seems to me the boba here is sweeter than I've had, still had good chewy texture. Regular sweet must be insanely sugary because 50% was a little too sweet for me! Next time I'll get the 20% sugar. Overall a great experience! I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"This one is a little trendier than the other ones around. My brother swears by the Okinawa milk tea. I tried it and thought it was alright. It's good if you're looking for something different but I have boba milk tea so infrequently living in Cincinnati that I usually like to just order the normal kind when I get the chance.  The level of customization is quite nice. You can choose from tons of add-ins and options, including different kinds of boba, ice level (and they don't skimp on the drink when you lower the ice!), and sweetness level. Many boba places are too sweet at 100% for my taste so I always appreciate when there's an option to tune that. My boyfriend got the 20% and he thought it wasn't sweet enough but I really enjoyed that you could taste that the drink was actually made from tea."}
{"text":"I was excited to get milk tea here, but I feel customer service needs work. I walked in 5 min til noon (not knowing they hadn't open yet) the girl said we aren't open yet. As it was just 5 min before they open they couldn't just asked if I could wait for a few minutes as they get ready. Once I leave the store, I am not coming back."}
{"text":"I do not know why this place gets so many rave reviews. 1. The person who took my order did not know what \"regular boba milk tea\" even was. Then she proceeded to point out the various milk teas they had. I had to repeat my order a half dozen times before she rang me up for what was \"the most popular tea,\" their house special tea... some concoction with oolong leaves. Where is the black tea?! 2. Regular black boba was gone, so I settled for brown sugar boba. However upon receiving my drink, while the tea was okay at best, the boba was wildly inconsistent even within the cup. Some were mushy and had no chewiness, some were firm all the way though, and others were encapsulated in mushiness, with a very grainy center. No \"perfectly cooked\" bobas here.  My philosophy for a boba place is, if you can't even do a normal boba milk tea right, you have pretty much failed in my book, no matter what other fancy things you have. This place has failed to the point that I see a straw loaded with poorly cooked boba and I can't even drink through it any more!  Edit: I bumped it up because the staff refunded me, and offered to remake my drink which I ultimately declined. The excuse was that some customers like the brown sugar boba because it is sweeter, however if you mess up the consistency and quality, can it honestly be a proper product?"}
{"text":"Shout out to everyone old enough to remember Eba being THE boba place for all Sun Devils. RIP, Eba.  *chest pounds and points to the sky*  With all the new development happening around ASU comes a lot of new eateries. While this plaza isn't new and Tea Swirl has been around since 2016, Tea Swirl is now the place for Sun Devils to get their boba fix. From Instagram worthy drinks to its excellent location, it's easy to see how Tea Swirl is so enticing.  We got a Galaxy Swirl with brown sugar boba ($5.55) and a Yogurt Green Tea with crema and brown sugar boba ($5.35). It was $11.78 after tax. So the Galaxy Swirl, left layered and looking pretty, tastes too sweet and artificial. If you mix it all up, it's bearable. The Yogurt Green Tea with crema though was great. It had a strong green tea flavor with just the right amount of creaminess. I think I'd definitely stick with their tea drinks instead of their mocktails.  To be noted, you can customize how much ice and sweetness you want for your drink.  All in all, it's a great place with a huge following.  The tea is so robust and I'm kind of addicted to the Earl Grey right now!"}
{"text":"New favorite boba place in AZ! The Okinawa Milk Tea with brown sugar boba is a MUST try for any sweet tooth! Great atmosphere, great customer service, and great drinks!"}
{"text":"Tea Swirl is the best boba in Arizona, no question. Today I ordered a Honey Jasmine Milk Tea with black boba and it came out amazing. Since I ordered it with light ice, I sweetened it at 80% and it was perfect. I love that you can sweeten it with honey instead of sugar if you'd like. The black boba was a perfect consistency, and the option of a slightly larger white boba is nice. The people behind the counter are always friendly and helpful when it comes to recommendations... I have been a consumer now since last July when they opened and they have always been delicious. Thank you Tea Swirl for your authentic & tastey product."}
{"text":"My all time favorite is jasmine green milk tea. So far this place makes it the best, at least in the Tempe-Mesa area. Get it with 80% sweetness and brown sugar boba.  Tried my wife's Okinawa milk tea. It's good as well."}
{"text":"Decent assortment of teas, milk teas, and more \"juicy\" drinks. Personally, I liked the house swirl and Assam milk teas! Basically the boba place to go to next to campus. I wish they had a smaller size though :("}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday and they don't open until 12:00 pm, so had to wait 15 minutes and then when I ordered they had no Boba because it was cooking and would not be ready for another 30 minutes.   Suggestion for Tea Swirl, if you are a boba tea house and you know it takes 30 minutes to cook the boba, wouldn't you start cooking them at 11:30 am so they would be ready when you opened at 12:00 pm and have available.  Most likely will not come here again, customer service was horrible and that is being nice."}
