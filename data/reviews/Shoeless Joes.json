{"text":"Bruschetta not recommended. Had a pretty good panini for thanksgiving. The kettle chips weren't great. Terrible location."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  Ordered a Portebello and vegetable sandwich. The sandwich was 90 onions some lettuce and no mushrooms.   I sent it back and it arrived with 2 small wrinkly slices of some small type of mushroom, not a Portobello mushroom and more onions.  I turned it back and the chef came out and argued with me about what should be in the sandwich. He said sometimes you get mushrooms sometimes you don't.  That is not the way it was presented in the menu, it was totally misrepresented. He said too bad for me that is what you get.   I asked them to take it back and remove it from the bill.  They did do that.   I would never go back to this restaurant, It is unimaginable that the Chef would argue with me instead of trying to fix the problem.  He was very rude and unprofessional."}
