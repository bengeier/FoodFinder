{"text":"I've eaten at this restaurant a few times. This is the same person who also owns the China Garden restaurant in the Derry and Airport area.   The food is nothing special, I usually go here if I am craving hakka and too lazy to drive further. It's all about convenience rather than the quality of food or the experience.   The owner's name is Philip, and his customer service skills are horrible. He never smiles or even attempts to make conversation with his customers. In fact I would as far as to say that it almost feels like he is doing you a favor by taking your order. His personality is \"dry as bones\".   Another thing I find odd is the fact that his children are running around the restaurant and making lots of noise. I completely understand that his wife and him have to take care of their kids, but if they are going to bring them to work at least ask them to be civil. People are paying money for enjoyment, not a daycare environment!  I usually order the chilli chicken (with gravy), hot and sour soup and Manchurian balls. The chicken is pink sometimes, and when I complain he says it is because \"it is dark meat\"???? I really don't understand his logic, I mean dark meat can still be cooked can it not??? And no chicken that I know of is PINK if it is indeed thoroughly cooked.  Anyway, point is save your time and money... check another place. If you wish to try it (because it is convenient or you're just curious) keep your expectations in check."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst experience Ive encountered in a restaurant. First off, the cashier seemed like he had no clue what he was doing, had me repeating myself several times. The customer service was terrible and had me waiting additional time on my order. The food was no where near what I ordered. The beef was undercooked, the honey garlic \"spicy\" chicken was not spicy at all and got curry noodles. The boss should really pay more attention to his restaurant and workers, rather than sit his ass down and watch whatever the fuck he was watching."}
{"text":"I've gone there a few times around 3pm and it's always pretty quiet. I usually get a chicken dish and a rice dish, and they're flavorful but kind of average.  The real fun at China Garden comes from eating their Hakka food, and wondering as you eat it if anyone has ever died from having their mouth be on fire from such spicy food."}
{"text":"Literally the worst service I have ever experienced. Don't even answer the phone when you try to preorder and they put you on hold and don't answer. Completely disorganized with their picks up and cashing out and taking orders. Had to wait 15 minutes just to even be acknowledged and then was told it would take 40 minutes for my food to be ready. Find any other Hakka place not even worth going."}
{"text":"Good portion and good food. If you don't mind drinking water sub a second spring roll for your soft drink in the lunch special."}
{"text":"The reviewer below nailed it, I couldn't have written it better.  Every single thing written below about \"Phillip\" is true, he never smiles and it's so funny about the \"acting as if its his favor to be taking your order\", I literally get the exact same feeling from him.  Service is pitiful, and I don't care for the food either, the chicken is so fatty and gristly I don't even know where he's getting such low grade meat..  Been a couple times and definitely won't be back.  There's loads of Hakka choices in Peel Region now, no need to settle for junk."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening for dinner. It was a group of 5 of us and we got a bunch of different dishes to try. We started with Hot and Sour soup with chicken. It was good and comparable to many other Asian/Hakka places.   Then we ordered Hakka Fried Noodles, Veggie Fried Rice, Chilli Chicken and a Paneer dish I didn't try.  The Hakka fried noodles were awesome, pretty spice and well seasoned, the portion was also large and we had enough for everyone at the table. The fried rice was alright definitely not the best I've had but not the worst either.   The Chilli Chicken was tasty we got the one in gravy and it was pretty good not the best but again not the worst.  All in all this place is pretty good for a cheap meal to share, I'm sure we'll be back as nothing was bad and somethings were exceptionally good."}
{"text":"It was okay. I had better hakka Chinese.. it's still not the best, as my spot in Toronto. Will I come back again?  The food needs more flavoring, I felt it lacked a bit of flavor, but the vegetable spring rolls were Amazing, I'll buy All of them if I could, lolol"}
{"text":"General Tao chicken and chicken fried rice. Excellent Hakka food. People are complaining about the service... Really? Have you ever been to a Hakka restaurant that had exceptional service? I've been to most of them and they are all the same. This place is legit."}
