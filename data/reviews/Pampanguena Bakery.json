{"text":"I come here almost everyday.
I spend over $100 a week on this place to eat.
After my meal, I just wanted a quick cup of water to wash down the food.
They say, I have to buy my water.
I WOULDNT TREAT A DOG LIKE THEY TREATED ME.
I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Love it. Very authentic Kapampangan. Reminds me of my lola's and aunt's  cooking. I want to see traditional kapampangan dishes next time though like chicken pastel and relyeno. My take out came out to $30 though for 2 small items, 2 medium and 2 large rice."}
{"text":"Excellent no frills Philipino food. It's a well known spot and the menu changes daily. Call in if you want something particular like Kare-Kare.


The store also doubles as a trading store, so you'll find things like mixes, and banana ketchup, etc."}
{"text":"Pampanguena Bakery is a small slice of sunny Philippines in the middle of Little Israel. Only in Toronto. Go multiculturalism.

In addition to being a Filipino bakery selling decent baked goods and spices, it triples up as a hot buffet station serving very authentic Filipino food and a Western Union outlet.

I've tried the food on a few occasions and while there's good variety of pork and fish dishes I can't say that I am a big fan. It's been hit or miss. Sometimes too salty, other times too greasy or too acidic. 

It's all very authentic: from balut to bilo bilo and bangus.

I am a fan of Filipino food and visit Sampaguida Village quite a bit. I was excited to see Pampanguena close by, but unfortunately I am not going to visit again for food.

The servers and the proprietor are always very polite, cheerful and patient explaining things to me. They take great pride in their culture and serve as great ambassadors of the island nation.

This bakery serves as a lifeline for the Filipino expats working in the area: folks line up early morning on Fridays to send remittances home, in the evenings there are quite a few people eating dinner while watching Filipino dramas on the mounted TV and the ebb and flow of Tagalog is a constant here.

For serving as an anchor for the Filipino community in mid town Toronto, I am happy to give Pampanguena Bakery 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"They have very nice and welcoming people. I was impressed by the service. The mangos that they have are juicy and fresh. Take out food is delicious, I got some beans, chicken and pork stems, I was impressed. I also got beef stew it was well seasoned, but dry. However, I will for sure come back. Overall - great."}
