{"text":"We ordered take out from here a couple of nights after we moved.  It took over an hour for our order and they still got a couple of things wrong and we just did not have time to have it fixed.  The food is another story.  I have tasted frozen tv dinners that were better.  I do not understand how you can have cooks that do not taste their own food and I know they did not taste it or they would not have served us what they did.  When we ordered it was around 5:00 pm and there was hardly anyone there so it was not busy enough for order to take so long.  Most, if not all of the food was either frozen or pre-prepped like salads with the exception of a sandwich that was made but it had all frozen and pre-prepped items on it. So.....I am left wondering why did it take over an hour to prepare our meals for take out.  They are suppose to have been changing there menu but that is not all that needs to be changed.  I don't think I will waste anymore of my money here."}
{"text":"The salad bar has no proteins but is decent enough.  We sat on the patio and it was after lunch so there was almost nobody there....our server was nice and we all ordered drinks...took her about 5 minutes and she brought all the drinks in these ridiculous 8oz tumblers.  Refills took even longer. It was like a shot of iced tea.  Seems like she messed up half the orders, however my club sandwich on wheat toast was fine.  I guess my expectations for a family restaurant in Burton were met.  Filled the need but not a destination place for me."}
{"text":"The place has gone downhill. As a family we used to eat there a couple off times each month when it was Belle's and I'd often schedule muy lunch meetings there. Now, I prefer to go elsewhere.  The service isn't what it used to be and the food all rates the same.they need Restaurant Impossible to visit."}
{"text":"Nice place and conveniently located right at the Burton square. I liked eating on their outdoor patio on a nice sunny day. The food was good. Very good selection, and their breakfasts looked real good (I didn't have one cause it was lunch time). It's a great place to stop at when you're out and about or just driving around the beautiful country area."}
