{"text":"Leurs frites sont toujours excellentes! J'aime moins la sauce à poutine (trop salée à mon goût) mais si vous prenez la tacos ou celle au porc effiloché vous serez enchantés! Le service est souvent plutôt lent, il faut pas être pressé!"}
{"text":"Very good food but bad service theres people all over the place and even worst they wanted and asked for a 6$ tip! I will certinaly think twice tho before going in"}
{"text":"Great poutine, and fantastic burger. Wow that Kebab Burger was so tasty... Madly seasoned, but just a tad too small. The dipping sauces for the French Fries were succulent as always in any Frites Alors joint.  The service was very slow, and we waited a long time for food, but it was worth it, I'd catch a grenade for that burger."}
{"text":"The short - pretentious, grossly over-priced and disgusting burgers with seriously rude staff to boot.  Came here with my family, easily the most disgusting food we've had in Montreal.  Ordered a \"Texan\" and a tiny, half-burnt patty arrived soaked in what I can only describe as runny, sweet ketchup. Absolutely inedible and an insult to Texas. The \"sauce\" was pouring out of from between a small, rock-solid bun. Even trying to pick it up, the whole thing was a soggy mess. We told our server and she took it away. They spent the next 5 minutes laughing in the kitchen.   When the bill came, they insisted on charging me for it. The server came to explain she couldn't remove it without calling her boss. In the end, after a phone call, they insist on charging for the burger I had one bite of, one bite that required 5 napkins to clean up the mess.  The kitchen \"cook\" emerged only to berate me and snicker. Appalling customer service and outrageously rude and arrogant kitchen staff. They would sooner laugh and dismiss what was a helpful critique of their precious haute burgers.  Other items on the menu are equally repugnant, unless your idea of a burger includes slices of apple, honey or some deliberately obscure variety of lettuce.  The fries were cold and soggy, and really skimpy on servings. For the prices this place charges, you would expect a honkin' good feed. Frite Alors thinks adding an olive on your plate justifies the ludicrously stupid prices.  Anyone who's ever seen Ramsay's visit to Amy's Baking Company might enjoy the experience. She serves up \"delicious\" food and anyone that disagrees is a \"hater\" and gets ripped off and yelled at.  The one star is for actually getting away with charging that much for this garbage. Never, ever EVER again."}
{"text":"C'est un très petit frite alors, mais il est cool. Des fois c'est super busy et d'autre c'est super calme. La bouffe est similaire (et même mieux) que d'autre resto similaire. J'adore leur sauce! Moi je viens surtout dire allô à mon ami qui travail. Mais c'est tellement le fun manger. Miam. J'aime Ben le comptoir pour manger et jaser avec le staff (serveur, serveuse, cuisinier et cuisinière) pis boire de la bière. C'est comme chiller dans un pub. Ils font pour emporter aussi. Et ils sont à côté de chez moi. Point bonus!"}
{"text":"This is a difficult one for me... Oh the agony... Being from Belgium, once in a while I get this craving for a good \"cornet de frites\" or worse a \"mitraillette\"... Good belgian fries are really hard to find on this side of the ocean and Frites alors! is the closest you'll ever find. There are secrets to making belgian frites and we do not allow it to leave the country, fearing to be forever deported or worse sentenced to eating north american frites for the rest of our lives. The agony being that I am happy having Frites alors! answer my belgian cravings but always leave homesick for the real thing/frites. Having said that, I will head there and eat my mitraillette. PS: Please Frites alors! could you also answer my prayers for a fricadelle, a pouly-croc and a bicky samurai, please, please, please!"}
{"text":"C'est toujours agréable d'aller commander chez Frites Alors : dans n'importe quel restaurant de la chaîne, les produits sont de qualité, les saveurs sont toujours correctes et le service est excellent. Le Frite Alors dans le quartier Villeray ne déroge pas à la règle. L'équipe est vraiment sympa et vous fait même des suggestions. Pour ma part, je viens principalement pour commander une poutine ou bien le burger Savoyard (un délice, je vous le conseille). Mais il y a quand même quelques inconvénients à relever, comme le temps de préparation assez long (une fois, j'ai dû attendre 10 minutes) ou encore l'endroit assez petit : lorsqu'il y a du monde, il est assez difficile de se frayer un chemin !  Un Frites Alors bien utile et toujours idéal dans un quartier tel que Villeray."}
{"text":"The fries were fabulous, and the overall flavour of everything was great, but the smoked meat sandwich had approximately 3 slices of smoked meat on it - definitely not what I would expect in Montreal."}
{"text":"I know this is a chain.  But it's a very very good chain.   They have great burgers (on delicious bread).  Great beer.  Great service.  And AMAZING exotic poutine (not just your regular - although they have that too).  The gravy might not be the best of all the plain poutine options in Montreal, but the special ones are truly special.  Try the Frite Alors! Poutine (they're own special one) - you will not regret it.   This particular restaurant in the chain seems small compared to others.. just, fyi if you need a lot of space.  I thought it was intimate and nice, though."}
{"text":"My experience is limited to a binge order of poutine my friend and I stopped by to eat on the way home.  Firstly, parking is easy at least... at the time of the evening I came in. The location is tiny with a dozen seats or more. It looked somewhat of a dive in the garage of someone's home. Sadly, as it is winter, even with the front door drapes for when it opens and closes doesn't do a whole lot of its clientele and I was pretty cold in my seat furthest to the door. Needless to state, I ate with my jacket on.  We ordered small poutine called \"L'Eau a la Bouche\" and the \"Cochonne\". The main reason is that we thought the poutine price was a bit exaggerated. Once we received our portions we truly realized that our small poutine, is pretty small. Considering it's close to $10, we didn't think we got a great deal.  How did it taste? It was pretty decent but nowhere near the quality you'd get at really popular locations. It wasn't McDonald's quality poutine but it wasn't anywhere close to what you'd get at Poutineville and with that location allowing you to order what you want and their \"small\" being twice as big as what I was served here (and the price tag being somewhat similar), let's just say, I won't be back.  Service was decent and amiable."}
{"text":"11h15 : la porte est débarré donc je rentre. La fille me dit que c'est fermé jusqu'à 11h30 en marchant vers moi. Très désagréablement, elle me pousse dehors et sans blague, du fait même me ferme la porte dessus. Pourquoi encourager un commerce qui engage des gens sans savoir-vivre ?"}
{"text":"C'etait ma premiere poutine, et je reviendrai a Montreal!"}
{"text":"Their poutine and salad were really good! The customer service was amazing as the hostess was very nice and welcoming to us tourists. I would definitely recommend heading here to those interested in eating true Montreal cuisine. I am for sure coming back the next time I visit."}
{"text":"It was the final hours of our trip to Montreal, and if we hadn't found poutine before departing, I'm pretty sure I would have had divorce papers waiting at home. Enter Frite Alors, which saved the day!  We got off to a bit of a rocky start when we sat, chatted with the friendly waitress, admired the mod interior, perused the graphicutesy menus and then had to leave because we weren't carrying cash. (WE NEVER CARRY CASH. Neither do most savvy travelers. Get with the times, people!)  However, once we'd found an ATM, we circled back, because not only does Frite Alors have poutine: in fact, it boasts an entire menu of poutines. Diners choose from close to a dozen variations that include sausage, bacon and / or grilled vegetables in addition to the golden standard of gravy and fresh cheese.  I was craving classic French food and swooned over the Croque Monsieur: ham, cheese, and mustard on toasted bread, though this one also came with fresh lettuce and tomato (they were added after the toasting, so it was a nice crispy-melty contrast. But what really tugged at my heartstrings was the option to substitute a small salad for half the fries that came with the sandwich. I'll repeat that in case any American restaurant happens to be listening: Instead of a GIANT PILE of fries, they allow the option of a reasonable number of fries and a small salad -- full of fresh, crunchy vegetables and drizzled with a creamy vinaigrette. I had been dreaming of that perfect healthy-junky equilibrium for years!  I was really craving a Belgian beer, but thanks to our shortage of cash (we were trying to use it all up before recrossing the border) it remained a dream. That silly, needless inconvenience is the only reason I can't give five stars for such a fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"Vraiment excellent, à la hauteur de la réputation de Frite Alors. Laitue-Tomates ultra fraîches. Petit pain carré et boulette de buf pur font de leur hamburger classique un délice. Les frites sont excellentes également, les meilleures qu'on trouve à Montreal probablement."}
