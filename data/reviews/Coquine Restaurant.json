{"text":"Coquine Restaurant serves up an excellent weekend brunch, with all the charm and flavour of a European patio café. The restaurant is decked out art-deco style, with lots of white tile, dark wood and vintage posters lining the walls. Coquine boasts several large dining rooms and a quaint patio, perfect for people watching or a leisurely meal. A large group of us descended on Coquine one Sunday morning for a late brunch, and found the menu to be both classic and eclectic. Let me explain. .

Traditional Sunday morning brunch normally sees a line-up of the usuals; pancakes, omelets and waffles. While Coquine serves up all of these items, they do it all with a pronounced French flavour, not afraid of adding a little gourmet to your breakfast.  Coquine's wonderful Apple Jack's ($11) offers up a stack of fluffy pancakes, topped with delectable caramelized apple and maple syrup. The delightful Vanilla French Toast ($12) is flavoured with fresh vanilla bean and served with a berry compote and Chambord. The Steak Frites ($19) were delicious, and came with a side of Parmesan truffle fries and mayo. While you may not be able to fly to Paris for weekend brunch, you can certainly enjoy the savoury French-style cuisine just south of Yonge and Eglinton.

Everyone found their meals to be excellent, and I can personally attest to both the quality and quantity of the wild mushroom and shallot Quiche with chévre ($14). Coffee (and Bailey's) was always available, and attentive extras like water for the group, and non-stop breadbaskets make the service at Coquine both pleasant and under-stated.

Overall, the value for meals was very good, as portions were large, and fit for sharing. Both the hostess and the server were polite and attentive, but never obvious. With an excellent location between Davisville and Eglinton subway stops, and great food and service, Coquine should be on your list as a must-try for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"We live in the neighbourhood and have frequented Coquine since they opened. We enjoyed the restaurant a lot right away and the original menu. Naturally the menu has changed, and thats ok but over the years the food has gone downhill in quality.  The salad's in particular are always a big disappointment. The prices don't justify the level of food quality, they either need to reduce their prices or improve the quality of their food. I ordered a dessert recently (the apple cake) and it tasted like they had over microwaved it, where it was dry and hard in spots - these things should be fresh for $9. The tomato salad had about 5 pieces of 'greens' and a chopped up not so fresh tomato on top with too much dressing. Its tomato season so the tomatoes should have been delish. That was $12 for that tomato. My husband and I love the location, the environment is great and the staff are also great - but when the food doesn't live up to the rest we will have to stop going. I would highly recommend Mogette on Mt. Pleasant/Manor for excellent French food - they take the time and care to craft each dish perfectly and never disappoint. Its not the same feel but if you want good food, excellent staff (but a quieter environment) in the area,  go there."}
{"text":"What an experience! Decided on Coquine for a dinner out with friends after reading reviews and was not disappointed. Great atmosphere and the food was outstanding. The French Onion Soup has been voted the #1 French Onion Soup in Toronto and it absolutely deserves that ranking. Main course was a stuffed Cornish hen and it was impeccable. Others at the table were raving about their Duck and Veal and Bouillabase. Our hostess Maria was engaging, thoughtful and courteous.  All around excellent experience at this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to Coquine for a dinner with my family and had mixed emotions:

Positives: 
The mushroom ravioli is to die for. You MUST try that. You cannot go wrong with that. The atmosphere was so nice and the so pleasant and it was relatively easy to get a place to sit ( as compared to the KEG)
Loved the hummus and bread at the beginning. It was absolutely wonderful. Kept on snacking on it even after I was done with my meal.

Negatives:
Wasn't a big fan of the services. The man was nice and friendly but there was something mechanical about the service. It was felt like they were pushing for a quick table rotation. It wasn't such a comforting experience.
My fiancee ordered the steak which wasn't prepared to her liking and she wasn't that much into the fries that came with the steak ( mind you, no options were provided initially to replace the fries, even though we later heard that it could be)"}
{"text":"This was my first time to Coquine and I wanted to like the food in this restaurant as much as I like ambiance (although I did find the seating a little too close together)and friendly servers, but alas, the food fell short in my expectations.

I started with the French Onion soup which I would give a C grade to, as the flavors needed to be more concentrated and more rich tasting. The saving grace was that the Gruyère cheese on top was nicely browned and the bread was good as well.

For a main I had the Moules Frites and my friend had the Salade Nicoise. There was a decent portion of mussels, but I found too many of them had fractured shells and while the fries were OK, they were not very crisp and could have been much hotter.

My friend's salad was also just OK, with the highlight being a nice piece tuna, properly seared on the outside and raw inside, and the lows being the potatoes that were not just firm, but just this side of raw (we noticed the next table did not eat the potatoes in their Nicoise as well). Also, there was some grey at the edge of the hard boiled eggs. where the yolk meets the white. A home cook can do this easily enough, but there is a very easy way to prevent this and I myself found this be disappointing and not up to standard in a restaurant setting.

I will say the restaurant was quite busy and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, as were my friend and I catching each other up. I just wish the food had been a better, perhaps this is also why I gave 3 stars, instead of less."}
{"text":"I had the pork belly and Florentine eggs Benedict here. The pork belly was delicious and I recommend it! I've had better eggs florentine as the spinach was a bit overlooked and there wasn't much salmon..the potatoes that came on the side were well season and tasty. The service was great, our waiter was humorous and very friendly!"}
{"text":"Came here after seeing this place in a cookbook at the CN tower gift shop (yes, I know!). Started with a Kronenbourg beer (the real deal straight from Alsace), then a tomato salad as appetizer.  Pretty good dressing with anchovy infused dressing. Gives it a nice salty taste. Moving on with lamb shank, Moroccan style with couscous, and yogurt. The meat just melts off he bone. A steak frites for our son that was honestly fantastic with the shaved Parmesan on the fries and herb butter on the steak. Just great. Overall a nice place with great atmosphere and French bistro fare. Oh yeah, there is a barber's chair by the bathroom too!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing gem in the area! Go here all the time for special occasions and never had a bad experience or left with something still on my plate."}
{"text":"All their dishes are very good. We had Octopus Terrain for app, mushroom truffles ravioli and chicken roti for main. It tastes amazing and perfectly cook. The ravioli infused with truffle flavour and the chicken was juicy and tender. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"* I am re-posting my review from FEB 16, as it is for some reason not showing up in the review section

I was excited to experience Coquine based on the reviews on Yelp, but I must say I came out underwhelmed. My husband and I have both been to different regions of France and love French food. We both ordered French Onion Soup and Cassoulet since we wanted to bring back a taste of France back. 

I expected more of the French Onion Soup. I`m sorry to say it did not compare to the ones in France. I`m not sure why. Perhaps it was the quality of the ingredients that was not there. The broth was off somehow. There just wasn`t enough flavour in it. I expected a flavorful, rich broth topped with some amazing Gruyere but honestly, the dish just fell flat. It just tasted like a North American version of Onion Soup which I`m not really fond of. 

The Cassoulet was not bad but not the best I`ve had. Again, I was underwhelmed. I do give credit to the duck leg - tasted good and fell off the bone. The individual components tasted good but as a whole there was something missing again. The beans were a bit on the dry side, not infused by the sauce enough. 

I really wanted to like it a lot, but it just didn`t work for us. Perhaps, other dishes are better - we just sampled these two.

The customer service; however, was nice and courteous and accomodating."}
{"text":"Delightful!  I have now dined at Coquine five times for lunch and dinner. Each time the food has been fantastic. It's freshly prepared, no frozen reheat!I The service is exemplary.

The decor in the small back room is charming; the drawings on the walls and the old 1940/50's black and white movies make it special. (NOTE: the tv is muted.) You would never believe that you were in a Toronto restaurant off busy Yonge Street!

The washrooms are downstairs and the steps are steep but there is a hand rail. The pictures and memorabilia on the walls are cool. The barber's chair is unique! They are proud to display their French Onion Soup Awards (#1 in Toronto Life for the past 4 years). I would love to know if there are \"French postcards\" in the men's room... 

I spoke with the owner who is charming. I suggested that his staff  request customers to write online reviews (I'm a marketer and have blogged about this topic)... he showed me a bookmark... his marketing does need a little help!

RE: children... unless your children are very well behaved, and have excellent table manners... this is not a place to bring them. I saw two young girls (about 6 & 8) they sat like little princesses and were as good as gold (to quote my mom!)

I hidden gem!!! Tell only your best of friends.... we don't want it to get too crowded, now do we:)"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch at Coquine. Food and service was great!  Great find on Yonge St.  If you are looking for a great bistro, look no further.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We have visited Coquine several times over the past few years but, for whatever reason, I haven't written a review. My wife and I stopped by for dinner recently as we were in the neighbourhood. 

The ambience/decor is very warm and inviting with a nice dark wood Parisien decor. There is a nice bar area in the front with the restaurant area in the back.

When seated, they give you an order of a nice crusty bread with a warm white bean dip made with \"loads\" of garlic and a touch of honey. Very nice but don't fill up on the free bread/dip. 

There is nothing better in life than a good Foie Gras but the price of the appetizer sized Foie Gras is the same as many of the Entree prices so we skipped that and split an order of the Escargot which were very good. For our Entrees, my wife ordered the Bouillabaisse which today was served with trout, oysters, clams, mussels, shrimp and squid. She loved it and said it was very good. I ordered the Cassoulet, not a dish I would normally order but this one was calling out to me. It was served with duck sausage, smoked pork belly, lamb, white beans and duck confit. It was...Tres Bien! I was able to control myself from eating it all so I could bring some home for later. It was a wonderful meal.

#1 - Steak Tartare - we had it here before, what is a French restaurant without Steak Tartare?
#2 - Salad Nicoise - see #1
#3 - Wine Prices - a tad high, 2 - 6oz (normal sized) glasses are almost $30
#4 - It is 2016, Who doesn't accept Debit?

All in All - a great place with great fare. Tres Bien !"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here almost a dozen times over the last couple years for brunch, lunch, and dinner service.  The decor is casual french bistro as you'd expect it; white marble high tops and black barstools in the front bar with bistro tables and chairs in the dining rooms.  There is an amazing mural in the back room, both unexpected and quite grand.  A fair amount of patio space is provided out front and at the side for the warmer days.

This is definitely a neighbourhood gem with plenty of regulars who come for both the food and atmosphere.  Be warned though, Thursday through Sunday nights are packed so the bar can get noisy, everyone is definitely having a good time but you still feel a sense of welcome when you walk in the door.  The heartbeat of the place is it's charismatic owner Rob, who you will find here most nights it seems, if there is a man in the city that embodies that European sense of flair with such aplomb better than Rob I'd like to see him!

The food here is basic french cooking done very well, you won't be astounded, but you will be very pleased, and prices are fair.  Don't come here and expect Alain Ducasse, Anne-Sophie Pic, Guy Savoy or Joel Robuchon.  What most people don't seem to realize is that true french cooking, the way the french cook for themselves at home is not fussy.  Here you will get  the best and freshest ingredients cooked simply but perfectly every time (everything is made in house).  Of all the times my husband and I have been by ourselves, or on occasion with large groups, every dish has been excellent, to the point where we find it difficult to order because its all that tasty!  If I absolutely had to choose I would say I secretly crave the wild mushroom ravioli and the white bean dip (provided free with the bread) is dreadfully addictive!   The 'piece de resistance' though is the warm maple apple cake, topped with vanilla gelato, baked fresh to order and let me tell you it is worth the wait...I don't share.

As far as drinks go the bartenders are pro's, and very friendly, the cocktail list is short however they'll make you whatever your heart desires.  My main criticism is that the wine list could be more robust, the selection by the glass isn't too bad but the bottle list is a bit too short for a restaurant with such great food.  The dessert wine offering is almost non existent with only one Vidal Icewine and three port's, however liqueurs, aperitif's, scotch and cognac abound (I acknowledge this is in keeping with the french style though).

All in all, this is a fantastic spot for any occasion; date, special celebration, casual get together, just drinks, brunch...your oven is conveniently broken...whatever, go....bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Great food. A bit over-priced. Small portions. But a nice place."}
{"text":"Wild Mushroom Ravioli, Duck Duo, White Bean Dip & Torte au chocolat = EPIC. 

Coquine is definitely a new Toronto staple of mine. Le Carnard Duo dish blew my mind. The duck breast was cooked a perfect medium and the duck confit was crisp and flavorful. Love. Love. LOVE."}
{"text":"I love this little place. So charming!

We first stumbled upon this little gem about 5 years ago and it wooed us with it's checkered black and white floors, servers in black and white and very European looking bar. 

The food also didn't disappoint. More recently upon coming back, I had the French onion soup with was to sue for. Full of cheesy goodness with a rich broth. Mmmm! Next up was gnocchi...a fav of mine. This one was pink thanks to the addition of the beets and also super cheesy. That makes me a happy camper. My husband had the quiche which was just ok. 

I'd totally go back plus they won the award for best poutine at poutine fest so that's always a plus."}
{"text":"Great veal and steak. The wine the waiter recommended 
was perfect with our dishes. The staff is friendly helpful and polite. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Our beef bourgonion pasta was mediocre, the beef was mostly gristly and the arugula salad was limp and tasteless. It was a very forgettable lunch. I intensely dislike having those advertising TVs in the washroom. We did have very good service from our waiter Ronald, he is terrific."}
{"text":"The service here is HORRIBLE. . . . rude . . . so rude.

The food is okay, but won't go back because the service is just atrocious (I have already given this place 2 chances)."}
{"text":"came here for first time on New Years Eve with a small group of friends - despite the place being full we were seated quickly and our food arrived quickly and the waiter was very positive and humorous. 

The management is what makes Coquine better than most comparable restaurants - I got a very positive vibe and no pretension from both the staff and patrons here, which is unusual for many upscale Toronto restos.

The place instantly reminded me of a Paris bistro, not a Toronto bistro trying too hard to look like Paris.    

I would return and I would also recommend this for business lunches."}
{"text":"BEST OGNION SOUP IN TORONTO ?????  NO WAY !!!  Le Select Bistro still has the best onion soup in my view....
It says a lot when the waiter comes to your table and mentions that its been voted #1 in three years.  It feels cheap to say that and makes the restaurant feel touristique.

So the soup was uneventful, lack any flavour and the cheese was not grilled but melted which made you eat big chunk of melted cheese..

The main course was served while we were still eating the entrees...A BIG NO NO  !!!  I did't come to eat at a BUFFET !

I ordered the mushroom ravioli...good...but too much mushroom....stuff mushroom ravioli with mushroom sauce and cooked mushrooms on top....this lack imagination...The spinach/olives and tomatoes were also on the plate.

My wife got the salad Coquine....The walnuts  were at the bottom of the plate, the cheese were huge chunks...this lack refinement....

In conclusion this place feels like a suburban restaurant dressed like a French Bistro...

One more funny note..... the reputation of this place being called Cougarville was true.....;)"}
{"text":"Brilliant place, it has a warm elegant but unpretentious ambience. Delicious food, gourmet - we get the fish dishes. Our waiter is amazing as well, 5 star treatment all the way."}
{"text":"It's a cute corner bistro that offers an above average rosé, great in the summer time. Much of the food is average/mediocre."}
{"text":"Noisy. A place for younger people. The soupe à l'oignon gratinée was average; the mussels were good but sparse and the fries were limp. The waitress was not friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner with my wife, had a great experience.  Plenty of options, portions are definitely larger than what I expected.

Poutine was great (a little salty, but you should expect that with poutine) - how can you go wrong with duck confit?  I definitely suggest that if you want to get poutine that you share it.

Mussels in Pernod sauce were excellent and plump and our server made a great suggestion to sub the frites for Caesar Salad since we were ordering the poutine.  These little touches are always appreciated!

Our entrees were done well as well.  We ordered the Ribeye special and the Salmon - medium rare for both and the salmon was a wee bit raw in the centre but nothing to fuss over.

We were too stuffed for dessert!

Only other suggestion is to watch for the back back corner of the restaurant where the AC unit is.  The restaurant was busy and we were sitting by it where it got kind of chilly.  (French Onion Soup helped out though :))"}
{"text":"Great place with a quaint little patio. Service is excellent - ask for Mike, a true professional.

If you get a chance to go on a Sunday, you might be fortunate enough to hear some live music from Jessica Jones and her two bandmates, Ben and Nick. They were fantastic."}
{"text":"Went to Coquine for dinner over the weekend since good friend of mine who is a chef recommended for the nice French/Italian cuisine. 

The decor was nice. It was very classy and warm feeling. Maybe I am biased but I am not so into the modern interior decor that many other new restaurants are trying to put - Spring Rolls as an example. I just don't feel too comfortable in that type of sleek setting. Coquine gave me that nice relaxing mood for a date with some vibes. 

We've ordered Antipasto Platter for Two. It was good especially the size was probably good to share for 4 people. 

I ordered Seafood Linguine and I've loved it. Generally whenever I go to a new restaurant, I try to pick the most expensive ones in the category. I have learned this from my chef friend. Since a restaurant gets less orders of more expensive dishes, more skilled kitchen staffs are usually responsible for making them and pay more attention. Also, it is good measuring stick to assess the quality of dishes on the menu. 

Anyway, my partner ordered Pan Seared Jumbo Shrimp & Sea Scallops to follow the same rule! This was also very good that it clearly demonstrated the sautee skills by the kitchen staffs there. Scallops are perfectly cooked with shrimps. 

Both of us really enjoyed the dinner there and the only down side was that I think we ordered a wrong wine to pair with these good dishes. We ordered Chardonnay, and I think the dishes we had were probably better matched with Pinot Grigio. But I can't blame them because it was my choice."}
{"text":"experience was ok. i wouldn't say it was the best i have ever had. food was ok, the french onion soup was a bit tasteless. the steak arrived cold, and the frites were powdered in the boxed parmesan. didnt taste fresh. but my friend loved it there so at least she was happy.

service was good, but our server couldn't figure out the bill. i liked her, but after what happened i am not a fan. will definitely NOT recommend it to anyone, because she thought we tipped her $7, when really it was 15% already. my friends freaked out, and threw money at her. after i crunched the numbers, we tipped her friggin 29%!!!!!! it was NOT worth it. Service was NOT deserving of that. The keg servers and food is even better."}
{"text":"Went with my wife on a Sunday afternoon. We ordered Creme Brulee and Bread Pudding and coffee. The taste and quality was top notch. Very happy. The service we got was amazing from Peter one of the waiters. I would definitely go back and would recommend this place to everyone. The decoration was very pleasing too."}
{"text":"Coquine never disappoints!!  It's a neighbourhood gem that has a fairly large group of regulars who have all become friendly with each other because the tables are set up pretty close together.  This, however, creates the best atmosphere you could imagine!! It's fancy but not pretentious.  It's a place you can always go to, even alone, and see people you know!!  The crowd his hip and fun and reflects Robbie, the owner and master of creating an ambiance and experience that is full of great energy and great times that you will never forget.  Epic!!  I have eaten there regularly since he opened and they are always spot on or are quick to overcompensate for any mistake made (They are human after all). It bothers me to read negative reviews because there is not an employee that works there that won't bend over to please you with your food or drink.  Please don't say your fine if your not and then complain on YELP!  Finally, the white bean dip that they serve as a gift to their customers is more than just bread and dip!  It's hearty and generous and delicious, as is everything they serve.  Robbie and his staff create a laid back atmosphere in very chic surroundings, fantastic cuisine and it's always s good time! If you are looking for a quiet night for a romantic dinner you might not want to come here but I would suggest calling them to ask to the staff which night isn't as busy because there is no place in the city that will do as much to please you, as this place will.  Robbie, thanks for being you and doing what you do.  You ROCK!!!   P.S. I have to say it... We miss Adam. Thursday nights are not the same.  Please try and get him back.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Very nice place.  Went on Sunday night - they had good jazz, nice atmosphere.  Two out of three entries we ordered were very good, as was the salad.  The third one (halibut) was a bit bland.  Overall - definitely deserves another visit."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with a couple of friends.  There was no wait for a table inside and about half an hour for outside (though the host said it would be just 15 minutes).  But in the end we stayed inside even after an outside table became available, since we liked the vibe.

We had a couple of beers and the poutine, which I found very yummy.  It had just enough meat in it to make it interesting while staying true to the original idea of poutine.  We didn't sample any other dishes.

The waitstaff was quick but friendly, contributing to the overall positive ambiance.  I liked the interior design, and the crowd seemed friendly.  As another reviewer noticed, the patrons are a bit on the mature side, but there are very few masters-of-the-universe types or hard-trying wannabes.  People generally seemed well put together, cheery, and respectful.  I'm sure this varies from day to day, but my first experience was a good one, and I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place has to be one of my favourites for French food in Toronto, after last night's meal it just cemented it. I think it just became my favourite restaurant in all of Toronto!

We first started off with a onion soup and a poutine with duck confit. The onion soup was done really well, with the right amount of cheesiness. It was quite a chore slurping it without having cheese strings hanging out of your mouth. A great way to have your date laugh at you. The poutine was alright, it had way too much cheese, it masked the taste of the duck., but still yummy.

The stars of the night were up next and wow they gave a great performance. My date ordered a wild mushroom ravioli in white wine truffle cream, that was pure ecstasy. Never had I had such a great tasting ravioli! You can tell the ravioli shells were made fresh, great texture - absolutely divine! I ordered their duo of duck, you get a leg and a duck breast on a bed of potatoes and green beans drizzled in a blueberry balsamic sauce. Oh yes, it was beyond good! 

The space itself is a bit cramped, but walking in here transported me back to Paris. Love the vibe even though it gets a bit loud and doesn't have a warm inviting decor. To me this place has a certain charm that might not please everyone, but I like it the way it is.

They only take reservations for parties over 6 people. Arrive there around 6 and you shouldn't have to wait."}
{"text":"Went for dinner this week and I've stopped in a few times for drinks over the past few months. The food was great. The bartender is great. However they have one waitress who really doesn't seem to like her job. She was quite short with us and just generally unpleasant. You guys probably should think about a replacement. I don't think I'd come back for food. Drinks sure. Food? No thanks."}
{"text":"This place is dark and almost uninviting. Service needs to improve a lot as they seem they don't care.
The food was good. I had an octupus terrine as an appetizer which was good but the bread needs to improve. Main dish I had the pork chop which was perfectly cooked, with some brussel sprouts which were the best of the night, brilliant."}
{"text":"Neighbourhood Favorite!
This is our \"go to place\" for fun and great food. We always have a warm welcome.  The owner is a true \"restauranteur\", he's warm and gracious, and really cares about his customers.  The ambiance is warm, upbeat, good music, and the poutine is absolutely delish! I have to have it every time I go. Service and food is consistently spot on. If you are looking for a restaurant with energy, and good food - this is an awesome choice."}
{"text":"What bad can be said about this place? It is amazing! The food is to die for, masterfully cooked to perfection.

Robbie (the owner) is hospitable and takes care of everything. We ordered the lamb appetizers and couldn't believe how succulent and tasty they were.

Ambiance, atmosphere, and good food makes for a perfect night. I highly recommend this place as it is one of my favorite gems to visit when I am in Toronto!

I reccomend:

French Onion Soup (rated the best in Toronto)

Poutine (rated the best in Toronto)

LAMB CHOPS (you will thank me later)

and Beat Salad (yummy)


Overall, Coquine is a classy joint with superb food, the service is outstanding and I cannot wait to go again."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto on business last weekend and Friday night was looking for somewhere fun for dinner with a client.

Coquine filled the bill perfectly.  Interesting mix of people, a tad cougarish until about 9:00 when a younger crowd seemed to show up.

Food was good.  NY Strip Steak and Frites...yummo.  Steak was cooked perfectly.  My client ordered the Veal Liver and it was actually VERY good.  And I hate liver!

Jeff was our bartender (usually sit at the bar for dinner when with clients as one is less forced to make small talk).  He was great.  Friendly, accommodating etc.

Quite reasonable.  Good vibe.
I'll go back if I get a chance."}
{"text":"French food has been very elusive for me.  For one thing, there aren't that many restaurants that have it and it's a shame because people are missing out.  This is probably my 3rd real French restaurant experience,  The others being Jules and Papillon, and as it stands now this place is number 1! 

My fellow Yelper, Tony C, recommended this place.  He's an Elite and gave it 5 Stars, shouldn't that be enough? hahaha

So does it live up to the hype?

Decor:
The restaurant was definitely bustling when we got there.  We were in the back room in the restaurant which was a bit more segregated but not audio-wise.  It's a pretty loud restaurant which is fine.  I enjoyed the ambiance.  The room we're in had murals of French inspired images drawn in chalk on a giant blackboard type walls.  
Maybe it kind of ruins the atmosphere that there's a TV at the top of the wall showing the game so I could probably live without that.

Food:
I ordered an Onion Soup to start for 8$.  I was excited because sometimes I do say to myself \"Quality is proportional to Cost\" and in this instance, I was eagerly imagining that theory.  It came in the typical onion soup bowl and had all the necessary ingredients like baked cheese and french bread inside.  The soup though, was a bit disappointing as it was a bit lacking in flavour.  But as I dived deeper into the bowl, I found another layer of cheese which was a pleasant surprise so it offseted my disappointment somewhat.  It was a big soup, and I couldn't even finish it btw.
For my main, I ordered the duck which was super for 26$.  I ordered it medium rare as recommended and it came out just right. 

We ordered an Apple cake and Orange Almond Cake to share which was presented quite nicely.  It was a bit too sweet to my liking but still a good texture.  In small portions, it would be a nice treat!

The portions here are large.  Even though I enjoyed my food, I did have a hard time finishing it and I'm not necessarily a small eater in my mind.

Service:
Our waiter was polite and attentive.  There was always someone to take away our finished plates promptly but perhaps almost too quickly sometimes.  It almost felt like they were hovering around trying to get as many dishes to the washer as possible.  That I didn't appreciate so much.  Also, there seemed to be a lot of different service attendants around the restaurant so I was confused.  Our waiter just took our orders, there were different people who collected the dishes, and an entirely different person who filled water.  Now, I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not but I did have my hand signal ignored by the \"plate gatherers\".


Overall:
Splendid French restaurant for a date or a small group.  Atmosphere is a bit loud so don't expect a quite romantic dinner.  Food was spectacular as well.  I will go there again unquestionably."}
{"text":"Mouth watering white bean dip for fresh French bread, with a great chianti. The duck is perfect. Service a little slow"}
{"text":"I've been to Coquine many times and I've never had a bad meal here. The service is excellent and it's always nice to dine in a friendly place where the owner and staff remember you. 

Everything on the menu is amazing, especially the chicken, salmon and croquettes, and steak frites. The roast Brussels sprouts are worth the visit alone!

And for the gluten-free people out there, they have a flourless chocolate torte that is simply to die for. All around, a great casual dining spot deserving of its reputation."}
{"text":"We had never been to this restaurant before but will go again very often.  When we got there I realized that I had mistakenly made the reservation for 6 people instead of 8.  This is a small place and there was a party going on in part of the restaurant.  They were sooo nice and accommodating although they had to squish the tables together and there was barely room for the waiters to serve the food.  All of the food ordered tasted wonderful, was hot, and came together the staff came often to make sure we were ok, but not too often.   We were so pleased with the service and food that all 8 of us said we would be back soon.  You must try this place if you haven't.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is great.  I like it a lot in the winter as there is a thick cover around the door so that cold air cannot get into the restaurant so easily.  Once you enter the restaurant, you feel cozy and warm. We sit in the inner quarter.  

The Escargots has the right amount of cheese in garlic butter.  It is so rich.  The Crevettes et Coquilles is a must try.  It has 3 seared jumbo shrimp and 3 Diver 
 scallops served over a puff pastry tart filled with mushrooms, cream and shallots, topped with crispy leeks.  The puff pastry is crispy fresh.  The shrimp and scallops are almost cooked to their perfection.  Our party are all seafood lovers and all ordered almost the same dishes.  

The restaurant is full. As it is along Yonge Street, the parking is not easy.  The service is good in a sense the server is far away but reachable.  If you want something different to try, here it is another restaurant."}
{"text":"Have been here about 4 or 5 times now......we come here for all of our special occasions.....such an excellent restaurant!

Ambiance is good, food is impeccable and perfectly cooked.  Service is attentive, with staff being informative and friendly.

Now this is not a health food restaurant and not meant to be, BUT you can make good choices if you are inclined to do so.  I have previously enjoyed their French Onion Soup (best I have ever had), their salads are very tasty and the entrees are not only mouth watering, but nicely plated.  A feast for the eyes and taste-buds....

This time I had the steak and eggs.  Also comes with a BIG portion of fries (Parmesan topped, I believe) or you can substitute a salad.  My friends enjoyed the fries and said they were very nice.  My meal was perfectly cooked, very delicious.  Simple food, done well!  However there are many other, more complex choices offered on the menu (with my new Paleo diet limiting MY choices).....there are no incorrect selections (at least from what I have tasted) on this menu!

Maria, our server, was great.  She even brought us a new dessert item to try (bread pudding with a caramel sauce, with fresh berries....delicious!), free of charge.  Yes, I know.....NOT Paleo.....I only had a very small taste..!

We met the owner (Rob).  He was very friendly and had a nice energy.  You could tell he is working at his labour of love....it showed in his smile and his natty attire!  If you have something to say, either complimentary or a concern, I have a very good feeling that he will listen thoughtfully and make sure that you are happy....

We will come back here many many more times......but only on special occasions, as we don't want too much of a good thing (we want to keep it special!)

Lunch for 4 was $135 (tax and tip included), with 2 Capuccinos, 2 coffees and a glass of wine.  A little more pricey than the norm, but well worth it!!

Coquine is NOT hum drum........be sure to visit sooner, rather than later!!  And don't limit yourselves as we do....make it your special date & celebration place!

Just make sure there is room for two more!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here. I usually have steak, the service is ok, not great. The atmosphere is somewhat dark and Cosey . I will definitely return"}
{"text":"Dark woody atmosphere, overly pricey drinks, bathrooms that are smellier than they should be, lots of older dudes with expensive unbuttoned shirts on, and unfortunately 2 TVs playing CP24 that take away from the cache. I think I had a good time here even though that description was pretty bad. 

Would be a nice place for a date, I think."}
{"text":"Un autre restaurant pseudo-français où le décor l'emporte sur l'usage de la langue française. Le service est néanmoins bon, sympathique et le plats réalisés avec des mets de qualité."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the years and I've always enjoyed it.  The food is fantastic and never disappointing.  Yeah, it's a little pricey, but I find that you pay for what you get.

First off, I LOVE the crusty french bread and the AMAZING spread you get.  I have to keep myself from filling up on it.

I typically get the steak frites and it is delicious.  The steak has been cooked perfectly every time, and the fries are yummy.  The presentation and make-up of the dish has been changed over the years, and I do miss the shredded parmesan on the fries.  Over the last two/three years, they've made some choices which I haven't been a fan of. The dwindling menu is a little sad, honestly; I'm really sad that they took the salad nicoise off the menu. 

The dessert, while also pricey, is completely worth splurging on.  I cannot recommend the PUDDING CHÔMEUR more.  It is UNBELIEVABLY good.  It's cooked to order; the last time it came to my table literally bubbling out of the oven.  So good.

The wait staff are always very helpful and friendly.  Overall, a great experience and a place I recommend."}
{"text":"The wait staff is way too cool to actually serve food to people. This pretentious, fraudulent \"French\" restaurant is to be avoided at all costs."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that, as a Francophile of sorts, I really wanted to like this place. Alas, it was not to be. The food is not bad. Not great but not bad. The French Onion Soup is, as others have said, pretty darned good. Close to the best in the city. Not *the* best but close. Throwing caution and Lipitor to the wind,  I followed it with a cassoulet which was also competently done. Le Select's version is, I think, a bit better (they use the right cut of lamb) but coquine's was good. The wines were underwhelming and only slightly Gallic. I'd have wished for more a more creative list but there were options. As others have mentioned, the joint is charming. 

Thus far, we are looking at 3.5 stars. Not great but not bad. What brought it down significantly, though, was the service. Our waitress was, shall we say, less than attentive and appears to have lost some memory functioning with time. When she did deign to visit the table she was a bit crass and familiar in a way that would not have been out of place in a Beamsville Legion. I was not, however, in the mood for pickled eggs and Fifty. In a place whose charm is largely based on atmosphere and ambience as opposed to food, this is not a good outcome and I'd think twice before returning again."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for six on a Sat night, and was very impressed. The service was excellent- they were attentive, organized, and very fast. The cumin-flavoured white bean dip that comes with the bread is delicious. Everyone was impressed with their meals and very satisfied. The liver was excellent, as were the pasta dishes. Would certainly recommend for a romantic dinner or large group out."}
{"text":"We booked the private room at Coquine for a small bridal brunch for 10 and it was just lovely. The service was quite good and the food was excellent. We all ordered off the menu (vs having a set menu) and all of the meals were yummy. We were not rushed at all and had a lovely leisurely meal. We had the room to ourselves and it was perfect for a small get together. The staff was attentive but not hovering, which was greatly appreciated. The frites were awesome; definately a must order if it's not included with your meal. Although we were all full after our meal and didn't order individual desserts, our server did bring in a lovely complementary dessert for the bride (creme carmel) which she did share. All in all, a lovely afternoon with delicious food, good service and wonderful atmosphere. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Calling all brunch lovers - This place is your best bet if you hate lineups! 

Coquine has plenty of seating and a nice cozy patio facing Yonge street and another larger patio facing the side street. This is the perfect place to get some sun while enjoying brunch! 

Our server was very attentive and brought us water immediately after we were seated and throughout the meal he checked on us without being overbearing. 

I ordered the Croque Madame - portion size was decent and the dish itself was delicious! Though not quite on par with the one I've tried at Le Select, but this seemed like a healthier version with less cheese. Nonetheless, cheese does make everything better..

The best part of my whole brunch experience was that we were seated immediately! I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Held my sister's 50th birthday here in February! Fantastic service, food and ambience! Arafat, the manager was engaging and attentive to our needs as well as the servers and bartender.  Appetizers were out of this world and flavourful, entrees to die for!  When I met with the owner to discuss the menu, he provided outstanding suggestions and it was within my budget.  I looked at hotels for this event and found the portions and pricing outrageous.  Highly, highly recommend.  Will look at holding my own birthday here!  The bread pudding! OMG!"}
{"text":"Dinner

Ambience: 4/5

{"text":"Coquine is the crème de la crème of restaurants in the area for atmosphere, food and service!

Coquine has that dark cozy feel to it (my kind of restaurant)! The clientele was a trendy group, the staff extremely friendly and the food amazing, especially the Cassoulet! 

I'd recommend this place to anyone in a heartbeat and will certainly be back."}
{"text":"I was sure I had already wrote a review of this place and now it sucks because I can not remember the details.

Great steak, that is the one thing I did remember.

The only thing I did not like was the small room we were crammed into for eating but that was my friend's choice. 

The other section to this place has a more casual feeling and is more noisy so it is kind of cool how this place attracts people for different reasons."}
{"text":"I came here during lunchtime (in the middle of the workday) on my birthday and was seated in the patio. We had a server named Brad and he was AMAZING. Attentive yet not annoying.  To start with, the white bean dip for the bread was great, a refreshing difference from the typical oil and vinegar combination. 

We order the sandwiches (the one with melted cheese on top and also the one with pork belly), the table across from us ordered the special and it looked LIVE. The portions were extremely generous and we could not even finish half of the sandwich. Because it was my birthday, the server also surprised me with a creme brule and a birthday candle which was a nice touch. He was attentive but not hovering and always ensured our water glasses were not empty (one of my pet peeves).

I would most definitely come back on a weekend for brunch or when I have more time to catch up with a girl friend and people watch. 

Also just wanted to point out that this restaurant is actually not Mt. Pleasant and Davisville but Yonge and...Davisville/Eglinton (it's in between the two stations)."}
{"text":"Went to la coquine for a team lunch on a Friday afternoon. It was a suggestion from someone who lives in the area. It was busy for the lunch session, so I suggest making reservations especially if you're a group.

A work mate and I decided to split two items the croque monsieur and the poutine with had duck confit. 
The croque monsieur was make on a thick slices of bread, the outside toasted to a little crunch while the inside was soft and melted. It was very cheesey with not much ham, so good think I love cheese. It came with a side of salad (or fries) for $12. The poutine was delicious! The fries are cooked in duck fat, its mixes with duck confit and mix with two cheeses, brie and another I can't remember. There wasn't alot of meat in it but the pieces were crispy and tastey $15.

All in all the lunch was good. The waiters were really nice and attentive and the food came out quickly. 

I'd good for the dinner menu to see if I really like to this as I'm just on the edge. I hope to really appreciate the food and the decor at night when there's is a different crowd and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night to celebrate a friend's birthday. It doesn't look much from the outside, but inside you're transported to france, and you could be in an bistro in Paris (without the attitude!). Great atmosphere, great decor, great service and a wonderful menu. I had the beet salad followed by the cassoulet and a creme brulee for desert. I couldn't fault the food at all. The salad was really tasty, the cassoulet was rich and meaty (wonderful confit duck) and the creme brulee was just delightful. Accompanied with a couple of glasses of French Pinot Noir it was a wonderful evening. I'll be coming here again."}
{"text":"Popped in for an afternoon bite and a glass of prosecco.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was attentive and considerate, without being too much so.  Nice place to talk and the food was good.  I had the tuna \"sandwich\" which was more of a salad which the waiter had explained beforehand.  Very tasty.  Nice ambiance."}
{"text":"The wait staff was attentive, knowledgeable and pleasant. 

The food portions were adequate, the presentation was amazing, and the food itself was excellent. 

I had the rack of lamb & my dinner partner had the steak frites. Both were \"perfect\".

I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Make sure you make reservations because this place is not very big.  It's in the Yonge and Eglinton area.  I came here for my friend's birthday and was very pleased with our food.  I had the veal liver and it was perfectly done.  It was tender and tasty with a side of mash.  Loved it!  I know a lot of people raved about the duck poutine, but I found it a little on the salty side.  My entree and the ambience more than made up for it.  I looked around and all my friends were also enjoying their entrees.  They had a decent wine menu as well.  I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday for brunch and sat outside on the patio (its finally summer!- patio season!) . The patio is completely covered so that you aren't burning from the sun.
I ordered the Oeufs Florentine and it was SO GOOD! The Hollandaise sauce was made perfectly- not too thick or too thin like how other restaurants make it.
The restaurant is actually a little far from where I live but it was definitely worth the journey! 
The price is a bit steep and the portions are small, but it is a French restaurant after all.
Highly recommend, I want to go back this weekend!"}
{"text":"Prices are high, but you get what you pay for. This restaurant has won awards for its poutine, and I regret the fact that I did not try it.

Pros:
-High quality dishes
-Decent portions
-Some of the best French fries I've ever had
-Incredible wine selection

Cons:
-Can't think of any!"}
{"text":"something about the line of wishful cougars in the bathroom makes me think this potential whimsical bistro is the local ladies' pick-up joint. no fear. i only noticed them on the way in, through the bar, and downstairs in the loo.
in back dining room (there's two), couples or small groups are able to enjoy conversation that is audible in spite of a hectic hum of many tables... all in good company. the seats are somewhat low and ceilings are somewhat high; thus, making for ideal setting for a first date (read: 20 questions sans romance). 
the menu is offers just the right amount of selection from french foods. all tasty enough, though a touch slow arriving at the table*.
i found the price points to be very reasonable. in fact, if the service was a better trained at fine dining, i would say it's a deal. while staff was friendly and knowledgeable, a little formal training and less cougar loiterers could really bring this place up to its potential.
if said potential was met, the \"slow\" food time might be more reasonably justified as a warm, cozy, date restaurant (vs the mid-life / identity crisis diner it seems to be now)."}
{"text":"We were a party of 6 on a busy Saturday night, so a real test of the kitchen and wait staff.

Only one of us ordered the prix fixe option, as there was only one dessert on offer for that plan, and if you didn't like the option, you were stuck.

Our server was a delightful young lady from France, which added a nice touch of authenticity to the bistro atmosphere. Although busy, she managed to keep up with courses and drink refills quite nicely.

All ordered appetizers, and they were presented virtually simultaneously, and all were good; escargots, salade de coquine and french onion soup were tasty and fresh.

As mains, cassoulet, beef bourguignon, veal chop (14 oz!), and duck magret were chosen, and all were excellent. Bistro fare is essentially French comfort food, and on a chilly October night, the dishes were flavourful, nicely presented and generous. The person who ordered the 14 oz veal chop had declared \"I will never be able to eat all this\" somehow managed after all, it was so good.

Desserts were somewhat limited, as they had started to run out of some options, but the ones available were delicious, especially the chocolate tart (more like a lava cake) and the apple strudel.

The wine list is extensive enough, and there is a wide enough range of price points, both in by-the-glass and full bottle options. 

Definitely, is a \"go back\" restaurant. Reservations recommended on the weekends."}
{"text":"The wild mushroom ravioli was surprisingly good. Came here for brother's birthday and also tried the pork belly and some of their seafood (scallop and shrimp), all great by the way, but I liked the ravioli the most. 

Creamy sauce was mild and goes great with the mushroom. The sweet cherry tomatoes highlights the dish. The sun dried tomatoes was almost too strong and seemed to overpower everything else. But as I ate more of it, I noticed was that the sun dried tomato served to cleanse your palette allowing you to taste the delicious cream sauce all over again. Sort of like the ginger they serve with sushi, if you get what I meant. 

Overall, great restaurant, great cozy atmosphere, great food and should give the ravioli a try."}
{"text":"It has actually been a while since I've been to Coquine but the place has been around for quite a long time and seems to never change. That being said, the food is pretty good here. It's not the best that French cuisine can offer but it's still a solid experience. 

I've had the lucky opportunity to live in France for a while as well so my perspective on their cuisine is fairly well informed. What I have to say though is that a short trip to Quebec City earlier this year has opened up my eyes to French style food and where I stand at this point is that Quebec City has surpassed France when it comes to solid dining! Perhaps France may still maintain a tight grip on the top tier cuisine in its own style, where money is no matter. But for us regular folk, Quebec City seems to have become a bit of a French food mecca!

That being said, if you're not up for the 8 hour road trip, Coquine will probably suit you just fine. ;) I'll close by saying that my impression of this place is that it probably shines the most as a brunch place."}
{"text":"The first time I came to Coquine was a wedding dress rehearsal dinner and I was enamoured by the décor and the wonderful steak et frites I had. I moved away for a year and had forgotten all about it until I ran into my friend last weekend and asked him the name. Well, for my birthday, I decided I wanted to pamper my taste buds and I was not disappointed. Everything was amazing...There were three of us so we ordered two prix fixe and a steak et frites! Just as wonderful as I remembered it. Coquine is high on my favourite spots in Toronto and will now be a recommendation to all visiting friends ... and local ones too! :)"}
{"text":"Had Coquine for a dinner cause I was looking for a place that served oysters ! 

I did appreciate the oysters , we ordered about a dozen I believe they were fresh on the half shell with the vinaigrette and fresh horseradish. 

The main dishes we ordered were pasta. One was the squid ink pasta. I was not overly impressed because the pasta again had a weird taste to it as if the seafood wasn't fresh. The squid wasn't cooked properly in some spots. 

The service was alright, our waiter seemed very angry at something. Not sure at what, but seemed impatient to attend to our needs and made it feel like a rushed experience over all. 

I would come back for Oysters for sure, but I wouldn't be ordering anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"I love French Bistros...Coquine was good, but not great. 

My duo of duck was OK. For $28, it's very pricy. I've had much better duck breast and duck confit (girl & the fig... Slanted Door) and this was really a little disappointing. It was a tad dry and not very flavorful at all. 

The deserts though, were yummy. The warm apple maple cake was awesome. The Choc torte was pretty good...very rich. 
Overall, great vibe, but wish the entrees were better"}
{"text":"They don't take debit. Really? Just credit card and cash.

Service 2 out of 5 stars
Food  3 out of 5 stars

Very quite on a weekday afternoon.

I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"As a newbie to this neighbourhood, I was excited to have a new 'local' as I'd eaten here once a couple of years ago. I've been a couple of times - once just for late night cocktails, and yesterday for an impromptu treat with the other half. It really is pretty perfect, from the authentic decor to those dishes that, as a european, I find hard to find in North America (I had Foie De Veau and hubby had slow roasted pork belly). The staff were efficient, charming, and genuinely happy in their work. The fact that I recognized them all from my first visit several years ago speaks volumes - good restaurants keep their staff! Extra kudos to the bar staff who didn't bat an eyelid when serving me and my transgender 'date' on the night of cocktails - and were cool enough to refer to her as  'Miss' - sadly this is a rarity in Toronto bars."}
{"text":"This review is based on a brunch experience. 

I am giving it 3 star only because it's a cute little French bistro. Neither food or service stood out. 

Poached eggs on the eggs Benedict was cold! Really cold! Coffee had no taste. How can you serve brunch without good coffee and perfect eggs?! 

Service was average. Had to ask a few times to refill water and coffee. 

Surprisingly, this place is full house for Sunday brunch. Is there no other brunch place in the area?!"}
{"text":"We have gone to this place twice and had a good experience both times.

The grilled lamb chops are absolutely delicious and the charcuterie board is one of the better ones in the city. 

The last time we went I had the Frère Jacques. It was a bit heavy but very filling, the scallops were enormous and the mashed potatoes were delicious.

The first time we went the wild mushroom ravioli and the seafood pasta with the squid ink noodles were lovely.

I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We had a ladies night here, chatting over drinks and a French inspired meal. The food took a bit long to come out, but there were 13 of us on a Saturday evening with the restaurant being full. Everyone enjoyed their dishes although some were luke warm by the time it came out.

I chose to get a regular tomato and basil penne since I was craving pasta. They gave me a big portion which was almost double the other dishes so I took a quarter of it to go. Parmesan added on top was a good idea as the dish itself was just okay (3 star). Also had a bite of someones calamari. Yum.

Nice atmosphere with good service (+ 1 extra star). I believe it was the manager who came by later on to make sure everyone enjoyed their meal along with a sense of humour joking about how he is going to tell the kitchen they gave me way too little pasta (when it was the opposite). I would come back to try more of their other more traditional French dishes as I dont think having penne alone does this restaurant justice. Splitting bills also wasn't an issue. Would recommend Coquine as a nice and slightly fancy but not too expensive dining choice near the Yonge and Eg neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Coquine is a delightful treat for a francophile like myself.  This place is bustling on a Saturday night.  For diners who don't plan ahead, you'll likely end up sitting in the bar, which isn't so bad when you consider the food you're about to have.  I've been here a couple times and have tried the cassoulet and duo of duck. I thoroughly enjoyed both.  Though the atmosphere is casual, Coquine is on the \"special occasion\" list of restaurants for me."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing French food.  So authentic.  We were served some bread with a delicious creamy spread (though not sure exactly what the flavors were), and our orders were taken quickly.  I chose the Croque Madame, and while it was ridiculously bad for me, it was prepared perfectly.  Crispy crust, warm ham and cheese, topped with a fried egg.  I felt like I was back in Paris.  My friends' meals looked wonderful too--especially the bruschetta with avocado, salmon and goat cheese.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you love French Onion soup you MUST try Coquine's.

The Coquine version is dark (probably a beef broth, but I didn't ask) and thick but not overly caramelized.  After my soup I enjoyed the wild mushroom ravioli and had two glasses of white by the glass (viognier & chardonnay) and both were good and almost great (but not great).  I must admit I simply ordered by the varietal and what ever I got was perfect in the sense that I wasn't poured the most expensive option by the glass (ie I wasn't taken advantage of - nicely done).

The atmosphere is great for me - I love hustle and bustle of this place and the bar is always a buzz with locals.

The staff was outstanding, friendly, engaging and the service was excellent.

Coquine will be on my regular rotation for sure."}
{"text":"Oh how I adore this place, if you read my reviews you may notice a pattern. I'm a sucker for a nice terrace, and this restaurant has a really nice one. Imagine this, it's a warm evening in July  and your sitting on wonderful terrace on a busy pedestrian intersection with a nice bowl of french onion soup. Ah delightful!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sat, food was good but I would not come back because the service was so horrible.  

- the restaurant was not full but there was only one server working the tables
- did not give us bread while all the other tables had it, we had to ask for it. 
- we had to ask for the bread because the food took forever to come and we were starving
- I ordered tea, they gave me a teapot but forgot the cup... How do you forget the cup?!? 
- I ordered crepe of the day which was good but by this point anything would have been delicious. 

Needless to say, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great food and service! A little bit loud but it's a smaller place with a bar so that's to be expected.  Very accomodating staff and delicious food, magnifique!"}
{"text":"Tried their crab Benedict - instead of ham, it has crab meat and guacamole, which was a weird combination in my opinion. It tasted alright, but would have preferred the egg to be more runny. I wouldn't say they have amazing Benedicts but would definitely come back to try something else. Their frites were amazing though! We sat on the patio and were never neglected. The waiter was friendly and they even gave our dog a water bowl cos it was a hot day."}
{"text":"Beware, if you have allergies.

If, like me, you ask careful very questions of multiple members of staff that your food order is your-allergen free, and you tell them it's an allergen, you want to trust them.

You don't want to be told three bites in that \"they are sorry\".

This is a dismal fail. It's also likely to completely ruin my weekend. Sorry doesn't cut it.

It'd have been nice if the original waiter would have apologized as well. He didn't bother.

To their credit they didn't bill me for potentially poisoning me. And I suppose they had the honesty to tell me - that's something."}
{"text":"We went there for a Romantic dinner, thinking it is a fancy - upscaled restu.

The food is really superb! No bad comment can be said about the food - Had Moules et Frites for starter, then I had some dish with duck - 2 ways...and my gf had shrimps and scallops... Then we shared a dessert (chocolate cake - which was more of a fondant)... everything was great...
The place itself, needs a lot of renovation... tables are too close to each other & they are too small.. no intimacy... very bright - lots of lights... and it is kind of loud!!
I would expect a place like this to have a fancier setting!!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was unremarkable, it neither enhanced nor interfered with my dining experience.

I started with the fritto misto which was satisfactory.  Shrimp, calamari and cod were lightly battered and generally tender.  The dipping sauce light and not particularly exciting.  

I followed this with lamb chops.  They were cooked just right, and fairly tender, but under-flavored: the rosemary and roasted garlic mentioned on the menu were difficult to detect.

As my main, I ordered the duo of duck: a roasted breast, and leg confit.  The breast was acceptable, but a little on the chewy side; similarly, the leg was okay, but a little dried out.  The blueberry balsamic sauce was dull with muted flavors.  Further, the duck flesh itself was not as flavorful as I expect duck to be.

Finally, I had the mixed berry crepe for dessert.  It was filled with a vanilla gelato which allegedly had berries mixed into it, but they were barely noticeable.  The crepe itself was a little stiff (i.e. stale) as though it had been sitting around for a while.

In contrast to the food, the service was quite good.  The waiter even turned up the air-conditioning without us asking (I think he overheard us saying we were hot). 

Overall, the food was not bad or offensive, but really quite boring and mediocre.  I will avoid this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"French Onion Soup Good. Service was okay, they were not attentive but not inattentive as well. Steak Frites, dry-aged beef not done to medium rare as requested, but I did not bring it up because I really did not think the server would care nor did I have the time to wait for a replacement. 

Bread basket was good, white bean dip was a nice refresher to olive oil dip or butter based bread spreads. 

Though I think the food would have been perfect if I asked them to replace it, the service is not special at all."}
{"text":"Environment was nice, very nice decor and tables. Place is situated right at the corner of Yonge and Manor so easy to reach to, however it's hard to see the parking sign, it's literally right behind the restaurant. I ended up parking on the street but that's okay. Service was a bit slow with respect to getting our food; my cod special was lukewarm, but good tasting dish. We enjoyed our time there."}
{"text":"Gorgeous French interior, elegant and cozy, excellent wine, genuine friendly service (and they brought us the bill only when we asked for it), and the food was delicious.  Great menu, great atmosphere, I wish more restaurants would take example to this little place.  Their small cafe L'Express café is  also very quaint.  Marble table tops and Parisian chairs, good coffee and croissants. Very charming.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food and staff..best Croque Madame I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This place is classy,cool and their menus is pretty perfect. At least for moi :) i used to live in that area so, been there 100 times.  I honestly don't remember their menu its been such a long time. But , you will love this place. A perfect place for a first date or to meet someone. No no its not a meat market. But , ppl seem to be cool at this place. Lol"}
{"text":"Took the bf out for an impromptu lunch yesterday and it was quite good. He had the ceasar salad and pasta pommodoro and I had the steak frites. Both were very good...with the steak coming with a tasty bit of au jus and the frites were excellent, topped with parm."}
{"text":"Derek was my server and boy was he dreamy. Yes, I am this shallow.

Food is good, and I will come here for a proper brunch to taste their French toast. Bit so far. everything I've had is succulent. And the crème brûlée, oh the crème brûlée!"}
{"text":"Went back to this restaurant after a few years away to find the same high-quality and good service I remembered.

The wine selection is adequate (though compared to other top restaurants in the city, could stand to be more expansive), but what shines here is the food.  It is fresh, unique, French bistro-style with some infusions from Italian, North American, and other styles, and served attentively and with care.

I had the salad Coquine, which came properly dressed (not overly, not skint), and was appropriately portioned.  I followed this up with the beet gnocchi in a gorgonzola cream, which was perfectly cooked and pure comfort food.

My guests' appetizers included the mussels, which were plump and delicious, and the ceasar salad, which was crisp and fresh.  The steak frites was prepared to order and nicely seasoned, and the \"special\" entree was actually a special - not last week's dregs, as some other restaurants try to pull off.

Desserts were passable but the focus of your meal here should be the apps and mains.

Reading other reviews it's been suggested that Thursday is \"singles night\"; this was not the experience that my guests and I had (nor were we looking for it; just as well).  Our reservation for 6PM was nice, but not necessary, as several back-room tables sat empty (but why?) throughout our meal.  Prices were appropriate given the quality and portion of the food."}
{"text":"great friendly service.  wife had beetroot salade with candied walnuts and goat cheese.  lovely!  I had a croque  madame, rich buttery gooey, awesome.  nice ambiance.  would love to try supper."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Had the pork belly called frere jacques, pear salad, and an assortment of dessert. All the dishes were excellent and portions were large. Many of us couldn't finish. Good service and relaxing environment. Bread and hummus was a great complimentary dish."}
{"text":"Coquine nails the sexy Parisian bistro vibe--the ambiance here is simply awesome, especially after dark. 

Likewise, the food oozes French flair....exceptional bread, great frites, nice mussels, fabulous lamb chops and the BEST onion soup in the city.

Warm service to boot.

Bonus: when weather permits, the front and side patios are wonderful places to partake in the sit-outside-and-sip traditions of gay Paris. Okay, the view (Yonge St) is not exactly the Champs d'Elyesee, but still, I have oft enjoyed parking myself here on a sunny day to enjoy a cold glass of rosé and the flatbread du jour.

Magnifique!"}
{"text":"I have been here for Brunch a long time ago. I have a good memory of that Brunch. 

I am going to go back for food and then report again."}
{"text":"Sometimes you eat a meal that just shocks you with its ineptitude.

We were looking for a nice, quiet patio on a sunny Thursday evening and Coquine seemed to fill the bill. And indeed, their patio is very nice and very quiet. Perfect.

The vibe reminded me of a Montreal-based eatery, so we decided to get a very French meal to share: Assiette de Charcuterie (\"A selection of artisanal cured meats with pan seared house country terrine, hard-boiled egg, Gruyère cheese, Dijon mustard, gherkins and herbed croutons\").

The platter arrived a short time later and the presentation was quite promising (i.e. it looked like exactly what I was hoping for). Our first bites told us that looks aren't everything, unfortunately.

The \"selection of artisinal cured meats\" was just a bunch of prosciutto and tasteless salami. (The prosciutto was pretty decent, to be fair, and ultimately the highlight of the meal.) The terrine was probably the worst item on the plate, unfortunately, as it had a kind of funky flavor that's not at all consistent with the best versions of this French staple I've had before.

Adding insult to injury was the pile of pickled gerkins, green beans, and onions, all of which tasted as though they came straight out of a jar. The black olives were fine, but again, they tasted like what you'd find at the supermarket in their olive bar. And we didn't even get any of the supposed Gruyère cheese.

What a fiasco and a farce."}
{"text":"Not only is the food here exceptional, the customer service here is PHENOMENAL! I came here last night for dinner with a friend and as she was deciding about wines (our server, Maria, brought her a sample of 2), I had decided to order the Foie de Veau (calf's liver, since I'd long ago read about it in Julia Child's \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\"... where better to try it than a French restaurant? Until, that is, Maria decided to tell us about the fish of the day, rainbow trout, cooked in \"the best coconut milk sauce\" she'd ever tasted. Now, I was torn... and upon the advice of the manager, Rob, and Maria, I went for the trout. My friend ordered the foie gras to start, with duck as a main.

The foie gras was AMAZING. Beyond amazing. What's beyond amazing? Use that word instead, because that's what this foie gras was. 

The trout was good (a filet with crispy, perfectly seasoned skin, served with butternut squash and green beans in a coconut milk broth that reminded my slightly of Thai cuisine), and so was the duck... but I'd wished I'd gotten the veal, just to try. Rob stopped by to ask how everything was, seemed to sense my regret and quickly offered to get me a \"tiny piece of the veal\" just to satisfy my craving. This \"tiny piece\" turned out to be HALF A SERVING, and it was every bit as delicious and amazing as I'd imagined. I'm drooling just thinking about it now... 

Anyway, go try it. The veal, the trout... but more than everything else, the foie gras. ALL good!"}
{"text":"Alas, one cannot review this restaurant without mentioning the decor and the setting. The patio and the entrance area does a good job of mimicking the Parisian flair - down to the right type of chairs. The inside walls are packed with Parisian memorabilia which is over the top but tastefully done.

The menu features a good selection of traditional French food staples like foie gras, Croque Monsieur/Madame, escargots, and steak frites. Everything that I have tried thus far, I have liked, which says a lot about the quality of this restaurant since I have been there at least 5 times. 

My favorite part of any meal at La Coquine is the dip that comes with the bread. Luckily for me, the dip can be refilled if you run out."}
{"text":"Went to Coquine this evening with my cousins.  There were 10 of us there and,of course, a lot of talking going on.  We asked the server tons of questions about the menu.  He politely replied.  Our drinks and food arrived in good time.  Everything came as we requested,  ie rare or we'll done, etc.  The food looked as good as it tasted.  My salmon was moist and tasty.  The green beans were delicious, crispy and the cooked tomatoes and olive with the beans was very good.  Everyone was happy with their order.  We all complimented Adam (our server) on his friendly and fun service.  We all enjoyed the evening and the food,"}
{"text":"I'm actually very disappointed in the service that I received today!

After a long week of craziness, I decided to come for a nice dinner @ a place that I feel comfortable with!

From the beginning to end, the waitress was very short with us and seemed in a \"hurry\" with everything! She was so unorganized that she even forgot to ask me how I wanted my steak! Are you serious?! Which place forgets to ask about the consistency of a steak?! 

Upon telling her, she has the nerve to say \"I'm pretty sure I asked you! I never forget?!\" What? So clearly I'm the one daydreaming right? Then she tells me that she'll take it back and throw it on the grill! Appreciate the gesture after the fact but no thanks.

Regrettably speaking, it's such a shame that because of someone else's incompetency the brand of the establishment is tarnished. 

It's only been my second experience, and here I thought this was going to be a place I'd frequent for a very longtime...

Merci.."}
{"text":"First time at a french restaurant, but not the first with french cuisine 
The restaurant is elegant, more into British or American pubs
The service s very good, welcoming staff with smiley faces 
The food is tasty, well seasoned with good flavors, the portion is good, we ordered mushrooms ravioli and duck sausage, it tasted good, thought the ravioli wasn't the best, it was a bit saggy, and the sauce is very creamy. As for the duck sausage i think it was a bit over cooked, but tasty and served with poached egg, white beans, carrots and celery.
We got cream brûlée for the dessert, it was lovely, made with fresh vanilla beans 
I think it is a bit on the high side of the price, but definitely I will come back to try the foi gras and duck breast."}
{"text":"Been there numerous of times, love the French cuisine.  A little bit on the pricy side but worth it. The creme brûlée is a must try!"}
{"text":"Bonjour Mesdames et Messieurs !!

Ended up in here for lunch today.
I'm not an expert on french cuisine but this place was very appealing. 
I'm also not sure about other french restaurants in the GTA but anyways here we go ... 

I believe is more of the 'fine dining' venues to go. 
I had a Chicken Crepe which has mushrooms, spinach, brie, and a cream sauce.  Came with a side of salad greens and it was DELISH!
It really filled me (maybe a little too much with all the cheese lol).
That came to about $14 I believe.

My boss ended up with one of the sandwiches which also came with a side of  salad greens.  The sandwich was also grilled on a smaller baguette and that was eaten in 5 minutes :P 

At night I read that they have Jazz... I think that is only on Sat nights. 

I would definetely come and check this place for dinner. 
They always has specials on mussels after 5 pm which is also a weakness of mine :)

Bonne Appetite !!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with co-workers. I really thought that I would love the place due to all the high ratings here. I must say that it didn't meet the expectations. Maybe it was too hyped up for something good but not outstanding. I had the duck sausage which is not bad. My co-workers had salad and the other the sliders. They were also expecting a bit more \"french cuisine\" from the menu. There were a few but this place seems like a french restaurant that wants to satisfy everyone by adding a lot of American/pub fares.

The place seems to be a little outdated inside, but maybe that's really what they were going for. If I've never read any of the reviews in Yelp, I think I would have rated this higher. 

I might come back for dinner just to try it out."}
{"text":"My wife and I dropped in at 9pm last night after a movie across the street.  We weren't sure we'd have a table, because the place looked full, but the host told us it would be about 5 minutes. We weren't even waiting for 20 seconds and we were shown our seats.  The server was very attentive, and had a great demeanor. I had the moules frites as a main and my wife had the steak frites.  We snacked on some of their great bread, and sipped our wine while we waited for our meals to arrive. Hot and tasty.  All the while the vibe of the place was great.  

We noticed the manager, Bradley, eying every aspect of the place...making sure things came out of the kitchen on time, that the staff was attentive to everyone, that guests were attended to.  You could see that he had the wait staff's respect and admiration.

We didn't have dessert because of how late it was, but eyed our neighbours' french toast.  Looked amazing.

All in all, both of us would highly recommend Coquine.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with my boss the other day.

Simple menu done really well.

Everything from the salmon to the steak is just normal - but it's done amazingly well."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. My family and I dined here to celebrate my father's birthday. 
It's a small, cozy spot filled with dark woods and panelling but warm and inviting. It was a busy place on Friday night. 
Our server was attentive and friendly. He went over menu questions with ease. 
I decided on two hors d'oeuvres - the duck poutine and French onion soup. The soup was fantastic. Most restaurants serve a very salty French onion. This broth was on the lighter side - but the cheese was absolutely the highlight. The duck poutine was delicious and savoury. 
Other dishes ordered around the table: penne with chicken, lamb, snapper fillet. 
My brother wasn't feeling his calamari. He didn't complain about it but our server still kindly removed it from the bulk. That's great customer service right there. 
I don't drink so can't tell you about the wine offerings but it was an extensive list and other tables seemed to be enjoying hearty glasses of the red stuff. 
I'd highly recommend Coquine. It's great for a dinner date, meeting with friends or family meals."}
{"text":"VIBE 
The patio is as Parisian as you can get minus the fence and the Yonge and Eg location. A fantastic black and white striped awning keeps you shady in the heat. Love that, especially in the summer.  Interiors looked equally as gorgeous. 

During lunch, the service is...leisurely to say the least. But he was a nice server and was pretty knowledgeable about the menu. 

WE ATE
The bread was fresh and came with a very sweet hummus which was different than your typical cold butter. Interesting selection for a French bistro. 

Dining Companion had the fritto miso which looked pretty fried to me although it came with a generous portion of aioli. 

I had the chicken, spinach, mushroom and brie crepe with a creamy sauce on top. It's nice to have an option like this on the menu and it was hearty. It comes with a side of greens and they put some parmesean on top for me. That said, the mushrooms did taste a wee bit burnt. I'd probably have something else next time. Their salads looked tasty (especially the caprese) but a bit expensive. 

I ended with a vanilla gelato (which I'm curious as to if it came from the gelato place across the street). It was a nice end to the meal - light and refreshing. 


OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Perfect for a business lunch. This would be a nice lunch date or dinner on the patio as well, though I can't tell you if the food will hold up. But will I be back? Mais, oui!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant in the area. Perfect for a casual/low key date.

Steak frites was pretty good for $18. The frites come with a garlicky parmesan topping, ketchup and housemade mayo. The frites were especially good.

The Coquine salad is delicious, with the perfect combination of blue cheese, candied walnuts, figs and prosciutto on a generous amount of arugula. Good size, too, which makes you feel less bad about ordering all that meat and fat for the entrée. The green salad was good too, as was the rack of lamb. The food is rich and delicious at good value. 

The wine list is decent. Definitely not the highlight of the place, though. They have a martini menu too. The wine list was good for a restaurant at this price point.

Too full for dessert, but they had crème brûlée and something chocolatey (that's all I really look for).

It was Sunday and they had some loud, Spanish language band playing. It was kind of nice but a bit loud.

This place is a solid spot for a casual dinner. Go here if you want delicious French comfort food at a good price."}
{"text":"Great Parisian vibe! Awesome food. I really wanna give it a 4 star  but I don't like restaurants when dining and there are fruit flies flying about. 
My friend had the beouf bourginon, and I had the poisson frites and mushroom ravioli with truffle cream sauce. There was so many good choices! I am looking forward to coming back and trying the duck breasts with foie gras! 

I liked the little Amuse Bouche which was served in little spoons. It was like a filet-o-fish in a ball! 
The calamari and salmon appetizer was nice and light. The piece resistance was the mushroom ravioli, not sure if they make it in house but it tasted like they did! It was pure indulgence! The pasta was Al dente and rich truffle cream sauce I still dream about it! 

I loved the bread and bean dip! I didn't get a chance to try their dessert, next time!"}
{"text":"I am a new fan of Coquine Restaurant. I went there first for my birthday. It was quite full on a Sunday night. We were greeted promptly at the door, and our waiter arrived very shortly after we sat down. He was very patient (I was with family whose first language is not English) and accommodating. 

We shared the roasted beet salad (Salade de Betteraves Rôties) as well as the Salade de Roquette. The beet salad had a very nice balance of the sweetness of beets, earthiness of potatoes, the acidity of the vinaigrette, and crunch of the candied walnuts. The Roquette salad had a good amount of delicious parmesan breaded oyster mushrooms (I am generally not a fan but I really enjoyed those) that had an almost meaty texture. The parmesan on top was also a nice touch. 

For mains, we had the Steak Frites, duck duo (Le Duo de Canard), lamb shank (Jarret d'Agneau) and wild mushroom ravioli (Ravioli aux Champignons Sauvages). The steak was perfectly cooked to a medium, as we requested. It was tender, juicy, perfectly seasoned and the butter on top was a very good addition. The parmesan fries were also delicious. Crunchy yet not overcooked or overseasoned with the parmesan.

The duck duo was extremely well executed as well. The duck was a nice medium, very tender, beautifully seasoned and was well paired with the croquette. I did not try the lamb but it was fall off the bone, I was told it was also delicious and tender. The ravioli were a perfect al dente and the filling went well with the sauce on top. A beautiful meal overall.

The second time I came back to explore more of the menu. We ordered the french onion soup and Foie Gras du Jour. The onion soup was covered in a thick gooey layer of cheese, overflowing over the dish. It was a classic well executed dish. The foie gras was a wonderful medium rare, seared beautifully on top and melting in your mouth. It was perched on top of a thin bacon wrapped terrine that was a great contrast of saltiness to the french toast-like seared brioche on the bottom. It was served with a small drop of berry compote. The one thing I yearned for was a bit more acidity, as the compote was quite sweet as well and the entire dish was rich on top of rich on top of rich. It was still a wonderful dish.

For dessert, we ordered the warm flourless chocolate torte and the vanilla creme brulee. The torte was one of the richest chocolate flavours I've had, and gooey in the middle. It was not overly sweet, which was very pleasing. The creme brulee was rich yet very light tasting. It was a good serving size as well and on the bottom you could see vanilla bean grains. We also ordered cappuccinos, which had a rich thick layer of foam, and a good milk to foam ratio. 

I would definitely recommend Coquine if you are looking for a more upscale, rich and well executed dinner.

Be aware that it can get quite loud in there, I guess because of the acoustics in the building. Also, after 7 or so, there is live music which can also be quite loud. It's a good thing it's situated in the bar area, which is somewhat to the side. Not the quietest place to dine, but the atmosphere is good overall. Our waiter was very prompt, not too overbearing and knowledgeable about the menu. I will certainly be coming back there again. Lots to try!"}
{"text":"I had the most unnacceptable restaurant experience ever at Coquine.  I was part of a party of 10 and we waited an hour and a half for our dinner.  The service was awful- our server was quite rude and never once came to apologize for the delay or let us know what was going on.  Only until after we went directly to the manager did they try and do anything for us...which was giving us a round of shots??  Who wants shots on an empty stomach? The food was definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of french bistro food, this place is for you! Everything on their menu is absolutely to die for! I usually come here for brunch so I can't comment on their dinner menu. The creamy chicken crêpe is so rich, hearty and delicious! Never came here without ordering their onion soup, not going to lie, they do have one of the best onion soup in Toronto!! Their burger sliders are to die for as well, both my mom and fiancé loved that dish so much.

Great service, lovely patio seating, great food! Truly a gem in the yonge/eg neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend on a Wednesday and the place filled up quickly, the tables are situated close together and the place gets very noisy. The waiters were very welcoming, as well as quick and attentive. I had their mushroom ravioli and it was freaking delicious. The cream sauce was so amazing that I was eating the bread with it!"}
{"text":"Came here at the end of the summer and was seated on the patio for late night drinks and apps.
My gfs and I split a bottle of white wine and they ordered mussels and fries to split.  I didn't taste the food but the 3 of them said it was great.  Service was very friendly as well!
We went inside after for our last drink, quite busy, older crowd but fun
Def want to come back 2 try dinner"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. They have Jazz Sundays, the female singer was lovely. 

The food was good. Our waitstaff was very attentive, and the wine was most delicious at moderate prices. Cute bartender too.

One star off for the ramp between the patio entrance connecting to the actual restaurant and location of the bathrooms downstairs..I was wearing stilettos and praying for my dear life! lol.

Regardless..I am definitely coming back. :)"}
{"text":"Even though I have travelled extensively in France, the best escargot I ever had was at this restaurant. The ambiance is so special that I felt right at home even in such a celebrated atmosphere. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Coquine. I come here quite frequently with my parents when they are visiting in Toronto, since it is in the mid-point between our respective places. It is normally quite busy, even during the weekday. The service is not the greatest. It's quite cold and unfriendly, and I often feel that we're being rushed out when it gets close to the end of the night (but before the restaurant is closed). 

In terms of the food, I would say that the quality of the food is hit or miss. I love the bread that they bring to start. It's served with a white bean spread, which is really tasty. I've tried a number of things on the menu. I generally enjoy the mussels in white wine sauce, but last time I had it, the mussels were very grainy and not very good. Other times, they have been really delicious and fresh. The dish is served with fries. These are also generally really delicious, salty and crispy, but other times they have been totally soggy. We most recently went to Coquine on Monday this week, and I ordered the French onion soup and mixed greens. The soup had a pretty good flavour, but there were like four bay leafs in my soup that weren't removed. I also had the mixed green salad, which was way too bitter for my taste. My dad had the steak frites, and his fries were spot on. 

I will probably continue coming here because it's convenient when my parents are in town, but it's too hit or miss for me to recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"I am already in my vacation mood when I was looking through the Drink Menu at Coquine Restaurant. 

I want a beer to go with my lunch... not like I am crazy about Boris ($4). The bottle looks kind of cute, but a cheap beer always taste like a cheap beer...

Lunch serves till 5 pm. The prices are really similar to the dinner menu but for lunch, Coquine does have some lighter fare: sandwiches or wraps.

My Chicken Crepe ($14) filled with grilled chicken breast, sauteed mushroom, spinach and brie with a mixed green salad was quite savory. The sauce was really flavoured and creamy but definitely on the heavy side. Chicken breast as usual can be a tad too heavy and dry for my taste..

Coquine does have this French Bistro Vibe: dark and noisy. My waiter was friendly and professional. I definitely will come back to try other items on the menu when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was disappointed.  I took my Dad tonight for Father's Day.  I thought that. overall, it was over-priced and just \"ok\".  

Good:

The Escargot: for $8 this was a nice appetizer.  Nicely seasoned with Pernod, garlic and butter, topped with cheese

The Lentil Salad: for $6 this was the best item we tasted.  Tasty, perfectly cooked lentils with a nice flavoring and olive oil (I think)

Not so Good:

Martinis: At $13 these were expensive and watery.  Nothing special besides the price.

The Caesar Salad: My mom really like it a lot; I thought it was ok but way, way too much dressing!

The Service: Friendly enough but at least two servers looked like they had no idea how to take plates away and seemed a little worried they might drop them on us.  I was worried, too.

We were 3 adults and one child; we had one glass of wine, 2 martinis, one Shirley Temple, 2 Caesar salads, the lentil salad and the escargot and, before the tip, our bill was $83."}
{"text":"I wish I had the chance to review their food but their service was so awful we just left. We had a 7pm reservation, showed up on time and waited to get greeted by a man (we assume it was the owner), who asked us to wait for a minute and left us standing in the door. We waited for around 10min, while this guy shook hands and had conversations with every person in the restaurant. He wasted no time greeting and seating another couple who got there 15min after us with the same 7pm reservation but obviously knew personally (They shook hands and mentioned the couple's names).

No thanks."}
{"text":"I heard this place was good so I went to try it. Started out shaky.  Ordered what was to be the best French onion soup but tasted like a concentrated burnt onion soup. Our waitress got me another but was very bland.  Probably because my taste buds were off from the burnt taste. It took abt 50 min for my friends meal to arrive.  I was thinking how I wouldn't return here again but the waitress gave us free drinks and took off the soup and was super nice. Great save!
Pork belly and scallops were delish!"}
{"text":"Good decor, great food and service. Tried it for brunch - the food was high quality and well prepared, but the quantity was quite lacking."}
