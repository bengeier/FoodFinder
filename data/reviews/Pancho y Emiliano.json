{"text":"We brought a coupon with buytopia yesterday and ready the reviews, after reading the reviews  i was a bit disappointed. I went to the place with no expectations, we greeted nicely and people are really friendly there. I sat outside it's a bit hot inside, food was really amazing. We loved the food and coke with bottles :-) We were totally happy with the food and service, i would highly recommend this place but sit outside and enjoy (its my suggestion)"}
{"text":"I'm also surprised at the negative reviews, but perhaps they had a few growing pains and the feedback has contributed to greatly improved service. I like the environment, I travel quite a bit and this little place reminds me of open cantinas, homey, casual, relaxing. Like it could become your local digs. We had fish tacos, ceviche and guacamole and it was all very good, very fresh and light. Great combination of tomato, onion, lemon, coriander and Baja fish. I felt good after eating, not overstuffed, but energized. The staff were totally attentive and super sweet - to everyone. Some people like heavier 'franchised' versions of their world foods, me, I love the people who make the more traditional versions or as another post referred to it, 'authentic'. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Food was fresh great fast service place is clean.  Nice to hang out a bit after you eat! Nobody pushing you out.  Good atmosphere"}
{"text":"Anyone looking for a casual drink with your tacos be warned - they do not serve alcohol. This wouldn't be a problem if the experience made up for it, which it did not.   While nursing our water in shot glass sized portions on a wobbly table, we came to realize that they had forgotten our order. Upon realizing this, the food came out randomly, leaving some of our group finishing their orders while some were just being served. They forgot one of our party's meal altogether and brought it out with the cheque and no apology. When asked where our change was after waiting for roughly ten minutes the waitress shrugged and said they were closing and it would take some time. Although they had the best intentions I'm sure the service ruined the entire experience.   The biggest highlight was the washroom - real nice."}
{"text":"We ordered ceviche, fish tacos and chicken enchiladas. The ceviche and tacos were fantastic and the enchiladas were good but not outstanding. Cute little place in Kensington market, definitely one of the cleaner ones. Service was great, my only complaint is that they didn't have their liquor license yet. I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Great Place! I stopped in for some appetizers and found the prices to be so reasonable. I ordered the Fish Ceviche that came with tortilla chips and avocado - all for $7!! The Horchata drink was pretty good too. Its a small place with limited seating but I would definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"Unlike most reviewers here, I'm actually Mexican and I love this place!   I guess I can see how many people would have the wrong idea if all they were looking for were fish tacos and burritos. But burritos are not even Mexican (they are tex mex) and fish tacos are way far from being a popular menu item in real mexican restaurants.  The real gems of this place are the tamales and the pozole. It would be really hard to find more authentic versions of these dishes anywhere in the city. The flavor is perfect and extra bonus points for having pozole since it's rare to find in Canada.  The churros were pretty good too. Unlike most places in Kensington market they were fresh and soft and not extremely greasy.  I can't give them a perfect score because there was no agua de horchata (had to go for just a jumex).  In a nutshell, if you want the fake stuff that is commonly known as Mexican Food you should go to other places. For the real flavor and true experience go to Pancho Y Emiliano."}
{"text":"The menu features an item called the \"WETBACK BURRITO.\" There is no excuse for this. It is offensive and racist. When my friend (daughter of Mexican immigrants) brought this up to the staff, they responded defensively, asking \"Where did you come from?!\" and then absurdly explaining that the item is a burrito covered in salsa and that the name is therefore appropriate. WTF. We obviously did not stay to eat there, so I can't comment on the food."}
{"text":"Holy moly, this goes down as one of my best lunches ever in the history of lunches.  I had the fish tacos and they were amazing!!  My kids shared the cheese quesadillas and I was pleased that they were very authentic.  My husband had shrimp tacos, and said they were delicious, but after a bite of mine, he wished he had ordered the fish tacos.  I loved, loved, LOVED the Mexican coffee.  Guacamole appetizer was also very good.  The servers were courteous and attentive.  I enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came by this place on a beautiful, sunny Sunday afternoon, and it was barely busy. Perhaps a bad sign, but more likely due to the location and underwhelming curb appeal.   My companion and I came to try to the fish tacos, which unfortunately were not that great. They used way too much batter, which was soft and a bit soggy when it arrived. And at $5, it made things even worse! One taco was enough to put us off, so we didn't stay to try any other items on the menu, although the table next to us had the ceviche tostado which looked pretty good."}
{"text":"The baja fish tacos were absolutely incredible. Some of the best I've ever had. Guac was on point, too. Friendly and prompt service. Will be back when it's warmer out to enjoy a margarita on the patio!"}
{"text":"Excellent little lunch spot. Lunch for 6 cost under $90. Very authentic combinations. Delicious horchata.  Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"It's really unfortunate that the service is so slow because that is what generates this star rating for me.  The food is absolutely FANTASTIC.  We ordered 2 Baja Fish Tacos, a pork quesadilla and chips w/guac.  About 20 min later we received the 2 fish tacos and waited another 30 minutes for the rest.  That is almost an hour for a complete order - not acceptable.  Our toddler did an amazing job of waiting patiently for his quesadilla.  But since we didn't want to eat our tacos when he didn't have his food yet, we ended up eating cold, soggy fish tacos when his food finally arrived.  They need to get the timing of orders sorted out.  Although this is the only criticism I have, I think it is a major one that impacts whether  customers come back.  If you guys get this sorted out, there is no reason why you shouldn't receive a 5 star rating because the food is very well done!"}
{"text":"If you like REAL Mexican food, this is hands down - THE BEST MEXICAN in Toronto!  I've been here about 20 times and Carlos and his staff are wonderful, the ingredients are fresh, and it's authentic.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the experience has always been great. The restaurant is nicely decorated and they have a really cool patio. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food is delicious with a wide variety of selections."}
{"text":"Update: while the food is good, the prices have been raised so high I won't eat here anymore. $17 for three tiny enchiladas with a little bit of rice and beans? It's too bad, but they've lost a customer."}
{"text":"Pancho and Emiliano's continues to be the best authentic Mexican restaurant in Toronto.  The food is authentically Mexican. The prices are fair and the customer service is excellent.  Carlos and his team care about their customers and trying to take care of you.  It is a new place and I think it takes time for new places to get everything sorted out but I continue going here over and over and the food is really good. Try the baja fish tacos, the pozole, the sopes, or the quesadillas with chicharron and cheese and you won't ever be disappointed!"}
{"text":"the prices are kinda high for the portion you're getting, e.g i paid $6 for one taco. Probably would have taken 2-3 to fill me up, when i can go to Mexican Salsa down the street and get 3 tacos for the same price.  but anyways, service is fine, food is good, i probably won't be back though"}
{"text":"Waited over 45 minutes while others were served.  They offered the special but it took over half an hr to tell us that it was taking longer than expected.  The food served to others looked fine from a distance. I won't be back"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of baja fish tacos at Emiliano's, and I have to say the quality has gone down. My last few tries have yielded greasy, lukewarm, over-battered fish - not great. I recently had the Seven Lives version, and while more expensive, it was a lot better."}
{"text":"Yikes. Where do I start? Well, we walked in around 2 pm on a Sunday and were told to sit at a two top. Waited around 15 minutes and no one came over to say hi or give us menus. The servers looked a bit frazzled so I went up to the counter and asked for menus. The waitress seemed annoyed (understandable) at me for doing this. Another 10 minutes go by, and while we have a pitcher of water, we don't have cups!  My boyfriend goes up to ask for glassware and is told to wait. He ended up just grabbed two cups from the other table (they were clean!).   At this point, the place had calmed down and was not busy at all. We noticed a couple come in and they were sat right away and given menus, water and glassware. We also noticed that the waitress was about to take their order (before us, even though we had been there, at this point, 45 minutes). We asked if she could take our order first and she didn't like that suggestion. She begrudgingly took our order. We got our food so quickly after that... JUST KIDDING!   The couple next to us that had just arrived, got their food AND finished their meals, while we were still waiting for our order. A different waiter came by with two plates, but it was for another table.   We spoke to the waitress, who really could not care less, about the long wait times and asked how much longer it would be, to which she replied \"Sorry\" over and over again. We decided to wait another 10 minutes for our food. In the end we walked out. The service was just horrendous. The servers just did not seem to make an effort to try to serve us or communicate with us. It was just terrible. It seemed as they did not care for our business.   I suggest waiting in line at Seven Lives. At least there you are guaranteed food after waiting an hour."}
{"text":"I was really excited about going to this place since they have tamales. The food wasn't bad. But the service was horrible. Our Mexican server walked out midway through the meal to get his stuff then came back and sat at the table next to us to eat enchiladas. He never told anyone to take care of our table so we sat there waiting for someone to notice us. Nobody did. The other one server never came. We asked someone else for our desert, I had to get up to get our check. I'll never go back there and I regret having left a 15% tip."}
{"text":"I wanted to take a friend to El Trompo but sadly it's closed on Mondays. I was drawn to Pancho y Emiliano by the  Rancheras that could be heard from a mile away  I like that the menu has a lot more traditional dishes than your regular taco joint. The Tamal was a bit on the dry side, the salsas weren't hot enough but the Mexican platter (2 tacos) was pretty good.  I started liking  this place even more when the bill came. I paid $20 for 1 app, 1 main,tax and tip included."}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly staff. Had the fish tacos and the chicken tamales.  The best I had in toronto so far. Will definitely go again doon"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with the food here. The beef tacos were literally 2 tortillas with some meat on top - nothing else. Super blend. The chicken tamale was just ok as well. With so many good options around, I wouldn't waste my time going there again, especially since it is not particularly cheap."}
{"text":"Ok, this place is amazing!!! I just ordered from Uber eats and my god I was so happy when tried their food. First of all people, THIS IS AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD! First I tried their ceviche, amazing! If you like it spicy, add some of the hot sauces that come in the bag. Spoiler: they are HOT!  Then we had their Chicken and pork tamales, also amazing! And as the main, we had their enchiladas de pollo (they come in a spicy tomatillo sauce), amazing! and we had the enmoladas. Now let me tell you about their mole. This has to be the BEST mole I've had in Toronto! I've tried several Mexican restaurants in Toronto, and their mole have been ok. This place has it right (if you know about good mole, and if you don't, then don't comment on it, because you don't know, yes you Yelp wannabe reviewers!)  Yes, the food is not heavy on salt, that's what  authentic Mexican food is like! That's why you add your own salt! End of story!   So, if you're looking to drink margaritas, sorry, they don't have a liquor license, get over it.   If you're looking for an extensive menu, sorry, they don't have burritos and chimichangas. (For your info, that's not Mexican food)   And last but not least, add salt! Or just go to Taco Bell, I bet you'll be happy there."}
{"text":"This place is a striking contrast to other restaurants at the Kensington Market. Kensington market boasts of many great spots like Seven Lives, El Trompo, Moonbean Coffee Co, Rasta Pasta, Fresco's, Amadeu's, Hibiscus, Krepsez, El Arepazo. I'm sorry to say this one is an outlier.   The food is terrible and the service isn't much better either. Also, was very disturbed to hear from multiple sources (saw the conversation history to verify the claim too) that the restaurant owner creates account on yelp with different names and hurls abuses at everyone who doesn't writes a 4/5 star review instead of doing some introspection and fixing things. Never setting foot in such a restaurant again. Run as fast as you can!"}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say about pancho & Emiliano. Me and my friend visited Toronto and when arriving that same day we went out for a few drinks in which led us here. The staff was very welcoming and I have nothing but good things to say. We even noticed while staying very close to Kensington market it always seemed to be full with people stopping and eating there. That must mean they are obviously doing something right. Will definitely recommend to anyone and happy to visit again in the future!"}
{"text":"Waited a half hour for my food (place was not particularly busy). When the food did come, it was not the right order. But I was starving so I accepted the burrito instead of waiting again for the tacos I had actually ordered. They had a new waitress serving us that day so the mix up of the order is forgivable.  However, when another waitress came by to give us our cheque, I mentioned that it was not the mix up of the order that was the main issue but that it took such a long time for it to arrive. She responded by saying \"this isn't McDonald's\". Sweetheart, we are talking about a burrito here; this restaurant isn't a fancy 5 star establishment. 30 minutes for a burrito is just not good enough.  Ohhh, as for the taste of their \"Wet Back Burrito\".... it was bland. It took 30 minutes for them to deliver a bland, almost tasteless burrito. A burrito I never ordered in the first place...lol."}
{"text":"After spending many afternoons walking around in Kensington Market, I finally decided to give this restaurant a try.  I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, but I enjoy the occasional quesadilla.  So naturally, when I was here last Sunday, I ordered the chicken pibil quesadillas.  They were good but the quantity was way to small for the price (11$).  I wasn't full after my meal but didn't feel like ordering anything else on the menu since I'm a very picky eater.    The atmosphere on the other hand was great.  The decorations were interesting (old tequila bottles, historic Mexican pictures...) and the service was impeccable.  The waiters were all super nice and fully bilingual!"}
{"text":"Food was great... Tostado with tinga chicken and one with barbacoa(sp)?  Also double tacos with chorizo! Delicious and a bit spicy! Food was fantastic but service was a little slow but it didn't matter once the food came out!"}
{"text":"The service was outstanding! Very attentive and welcoming people there! My friend had the choriz tacos they were great. I had the Enchiladas Verde, I suggest having the regular Enchiladas. The verde was too mild for me. Otherwise the experience was all good. Also, the Ceviche was DELICIOUS.   Wish it was warmer but it could not be helped since the door kept letting the cold in when it opened but the food and service was worth it."}
{"text":"Although there is nothing outstanding at Pancho y Emilliano, it is a perfectly good spot to park it in the market. Where other spots have outstanding food, this spot has table service and a great view looking out from an elevated perspective with a neat vista along Baldwin St. The interior is peaceful and has cool and fascinating pictures of Mexico and I found my thoughts wandering there, catching me in a reverie.  Oh, and I hope NOTHING changes when they get a liquor license here. I dig your vibe Pancho."}
{"text":"Inedible.  Imagine if your brother couldn't cook, but he invited you over for dinner.  He put together ingredients that seemed right ~ to him.  Seriously, it was inedible.  We left.  Wish our smartphones had worked in Canada (without int'l rates), we would have yelped this place and not gone in. :("}
{"text":"I had a Baja fish taco during Pedestrian Sunday.  It looked impressive but unfortunately, it lacked flavour.  Even after slathering on the sauces, it really could've been better.    I bumped them up to 3 stars because the service was good and I thoroughly enjoyed sitting outside with two flavours of Jarritos."}
{"text":"Delightful! We're planning on working our way through every item on the menu! I grew up in Los Angeles eating Mexican and Central American food and this was as good as the best I had growing up. Every person we spoke to was kind, friendly, and made us feel right at home. Our new favourite restaurant."}
{"text":"I grew up a few hours away from Mexico, having been raised where I was able to get homemade Mexican food whenever I want. Until getting lost in the craziness of Kensington Market, I was starting to despair. Pancho Y Emiliano was a diamond in the rough. They had homemade horchata, homemade aguas fresca, and DAILY homemade tamales. They were extremely friendly, but their food was what topped it off. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty and very authentic (similar to what I've had in Mexico City) but also quite expensive for what you're getting. spent like $30 last time I was there... Solely because of the over-priced meals I'd give this place a 3.5 out 5.  Food and restaurant design get a 4.5 out 5."}
{"text":"**2.5 stars*  Mexican cuisine is a favourite of mine for the same reason why Vietnamese is  - fresh ingredients are key in these two cuisines be it the avocado or the bean sprouts.  Unfortunately, the Mexican food we get in North America is as about Mexican as Manchu Wok is Chinese.  But tucked away in the melting pot that is Kensington Market, one will find a plethora of Latin American food on the cheap.  So when I heard that Pancho Y Emiliano had opened up shop, I just had to stop by and try it.  Even if it was just to satisfy my hankering for churros.  The first thing I notice about the menu is that it is divided geographically, which represents the hometowns of owners Jose Luis Lopez (Coahuila - North), Serena Prontack (Oaxaca - South) and Carlos Rivera (Central Mexico).  This is reflected on the menu with:   -  Tacos norteños, which use flour tortillas instead of the usual corn variety  -  Tamales, wrapped in banana leaves (couldn't help but associate it with Chinese sticky rice)  - Quesadillas, cooked on a comal (flat griddle sans oil)  A quick glance in the fridge and you'll see the usual array of Mexican soft drinks.  The bottled sangria-flavoured soda caught our eye though we were mildly disappointed in our bottle of grape juice; I think I would've fared better with a can of my usual Jumex.  I tried the Chilaquiles, a traditional Mexican dish made of crispy tortilla triangles (tortopos), simmered in a mole sauce with scrambled eggs. This dish is quite foreign to me so I tried it for experiment's sake. The verdict: I like my tortilla chips crunchy as opposed to soggy :p  Ever since I tried the tamales at the Stop's Night Market last year by SupiCucu, I've been hooked so naturally I ordered a Pork Tamale and boy was it delicious.  A starchy, chili-ajo pork-filled packet of joy, all neatly bundled up in a fragrant banana leaf.  Yummy!  We also ordered tacos of course!  The Beef Barbacoa (where the word barbecue is derived from) and the Baja Fish Taco. The flavours were a little too subtle for me and I would've loved a bolder taco.  On the lighter side of things, a Ceviche Tostada, made with fish which was refreshing.  The tostada held up to the juices.  Though we were both feeling pretty full by the end of the evening, we made some room for a few churros - how could you not when it's 3/$4 and made fresh?  And when there's the option of dulce de leche - I go for it!  You can also get chocolate and strawberry or be a purist and just eat it in all its cinnamon-sugar-rolled goodness.  The space itself is not very big, with just one communal table spanning the restaurant which seats about 10.  We were just a party of 2 and found it a bit of a riot to make table space for all our dishes on the table.  Pancho Y Emiliano, so named for two Mexican revolutionaries is trying to start a revolution of its own - one where the restaurant is more than just a place to showcase food.  Rivera tells me that he also plans to use the space for future cultural events including live music.  And if you're flying solo, you can always crack open one of the many interesting books (such as the taco encyclopedia) that they've started amassing as part of their collection."}
{"text":"Pancho Y Emiliano is small but packs a punch. Love coming here. It's cheap and decently authentic. The menu is small and although they don't offer alcoholic beverages, they do make up for it in terms of choices of meat and sodas.   Overall great place for a quick lunch, especially for groups."}
{"text":"I'm indifferent about this new addition to the multitude of Mexican joints in Kensington. On one hand, the fish taco was amazing, but the regular soft tacos were less than appealing. Not to mention, the 35 min wait which you'd hope that the reward would be an amazing meal, but we were less than satisfied.   It's located at Baldwin and Augusta, on the upper floor. There's a few picnic tables for communal eating and a window seating for people watching. There's also a piano for decoration but seems to not really play any other function - could fit more seats.   As we were waiting there, it was quite noticeable that there was no sense of excitement or energy. It could be that it's that the majority of people were just waiting for their meals.   If you're not savvy with Mexican food, all the names might be overwhelming, but the staff there are nice and are patient enough to explain them to you.  You have your tacos (a soft tortilla) or \"soft tacos\" (smaller $6 for 2) with a corn tortilla.  You can also make any one of these flavours a burrito - chicken, beef barbacoa, pork, veggie.  There's also empanadas and tostadas with creviche. Also Tamales (which I've never tried before til today) among other things.   They also have gluten free shells for all of their tacos, so I requested it, but they just plain forgot when it finally came time to make my meal (at least 20-30 mins later)   We ordered the fish taco, which was filled with some sort of coleslaw, cream sauce and guac. Aside from the fact the tortilla was not crispy and the entire thing ended up being soggy (waiting for 10 mins while my friend's taco was being prepared) - it was very tasty.   We also got two soft tacos, double wrapped in tortilla (not sure why) which ended up with a filling vs shell ratio that was less than desired.  The filling inside wasn't hot either, and tasted a little bland over all.   We also got a tamale, more out of curiosity.  It was wrapped in a Banana Leaf, then steamed (then microwaved to heat up before giving it to us). I quite liked it, but not sure if you can call it a speciality.   Let's cut them some slack, because they just opened, and still trying to figure things out, but unfortunately the food isn't up to a certain standard either."}
{"text":"5/5 service 4/5 food 3/5 environment 5/5 music selection 5/5 to go packaging  For those who like reading: +Coke (Mexican large glass bottle, not the mini or regular glass ones), comes with a side glass of ice If you want more ice ask for more. If want more napkins ask for more. Why complain here when there is service? +Waiter and Waitress came by 5-10 times tend to requests right away. Stark contrast to most restaurants in the GTA today where all they got going for them are looks. +Food pretty authentic, especially don't expect the fast food pulled pork style soft pork for anything pork in dry dishes like tacos. Get chicken dark meat if you can't enjoy carnitas with sausa add guac from guac & chips + hot sauce. It's dry for a reason. Compared to bunch Mexican home restaurant kitchen places in Texas, similar quality, 5 times size of menu selections.  +To go packaging heat sealed + liquid sealed using clear wrap. +5 min or so wait for tacos, 5 to 10 min wait for main dishes even when busy. This is 5-10 times faster than the Mexican place on Baldwin. Efficient operation model.  Try place yourself for the food not the hard wooden chairs, ignore bad reviews and decide for yourself how this place fit into your experience."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great deal! Food is fresh, delicious with a large variety for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. The patio is a great place to people watch and enjoy drinks! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere... Fabulous music, the sweetest staff who all gave super service and the chance to sit by a window watching Saturday Kensington shoppers saunter by. The tamales were full of flavour and deliciously warm (try the jalepeno), the guac was fresh and pretty perfect. Our server recommended her personal favourite fillings for my tacos: al pastor (a little dry as I got it without pineapple) the lemon and pepper steak (amazing) and cactus (surprisingly sweet).  A lovely spot I would definitely go back to... Note you can by their torts which are awesome!"}
{"text":"I came here on a double date this Saturday around 3pm.   Atmosphere: Looks inviting. Is not actually inviting. They should have a sign at the front patio that says \"Wait to be seated\" or something to direct patrons when they walk in. A man finally waved us over to a table where there was a family who had just paid their bill (that must've been awkward for the family because they were obviously still enjoying talking to each other and had no plans to leave right away). We didn't know where to go so we were just randomly standing in the middle of the patio for a couple minutes until a table finally cleared and we were seated.  The cups are small, the tables are low and wobbly. It just added to all the awkwardness that this restaurant was serving up to us.   Service: The server we had was a young guy- he was nice. However, they take a very long time. We ran out of water and had to ask three different servers until they finally brought it to us. It was scorching hot outside and bringing water for your customers should be a priority, especially when they've already asked THREE times.   The food: The presentation is really nice. But that's about it. We all ordered the nachos and guacamole- it was okay. Nothing special. Three of us ordered the Wet Back Burritos. One person ordered the three tacos. None of us enjoyed our meal. Super bland. The hot sauce is not hot at all. We all left with more than half of our food left on our plates. Not one server asked us how the food was or if everything was okay. They obviously just want to take your money and don't care if you enjoyed yourself or not.   Price: Way too expensive for the small quantity (the nacho and guacamole appetizer had minimal nachos on it) and lack of quality.   Ultimatum? Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks nice enough, but I found the food to be a bit tasteless, and too expensive for what it is.  We started with the ceviche which was a bit watery and tasteless (the chips that came with it were good). The tacos de carne asada were okay once you added the sauces that were on the table, but weren't much on their own. The chicken tinga quesadillas were better, but not any better than I can make at home.  Overall - not a disaster, but certainly not the best the city (or even the neighbourhood) has to offer."}
{"text":"Mexican born and raised here. Highly disappointed by the food and outrageous prices. It was not worth the money. I had been here a couple of times before I moved to Vancouver and the food was decent. Came back for a visit and was surprised they now have a sit in restaurant instead of grabbing food to go or eat there quickly. Probably because they can get more money that way. I was excited to try a couple of food items not available in many places, but I deeply regretted it. Their \"cafe de olla\" tasted burnt and was nothing close to what it should taste like. I've been to many Mexican restaurants in Toronto and Vancouver, and P&E is by far one of the most expensive ones and also one of the worst food I've had. Really sad about the downfall of this place."}
{"text":"A good place to stumble upon after a day of walking around Kensington Market. It was a beautiful day so we ate out on their patio. Mexican music playing really added a feel of authenticity. However, I was hoping to have bigger servings with my food. I found it to be quite small, so there was enough room to order churros for dessert. While I usually would have ordered the churros further down the street, there's always a line out the door, so this was still acceptable. I think the real hit, here, is the awesome patio to grab some good food and watch the passersby walk on by."}
{"text":"I like this place, though my experience was limited to pork tamale and horchata. Both hit the spot! A nice surprise!"}
{"text":"Bland, not a hint of spice or seasoning, MASSIVELY overpriced. With not even a liquor license to help wash it down, there's really not much here besides steam table meats and soggy pico. Chips are extra, no salsas to try and flavour anything, tamales dry and soggy at once (how?) Much too common in this city unfortunately. Kensington market remains hugely overrated (not to discount a few gems) but AVOID THIS PLACE. You're better off with old el paso. Not to mention my friend ordered a coffee and asked for it twice and it never came."}
{"text":"No idea how the food was but it took 50 min with no food or acknowledgement after ordering before we left to go somewhere else. By the time we were leaving folks that had sat down within 15min of our departure were eating. Hope they enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This place was just what I wanted. Authentic Mexican. The pozole was the best I've had since I was in Guadalajara. The service was pro.pt and courteous and the atmosphere was great. I sat on the patio and watched Kensington roll by as I enjoyed my meal to the tune of classic Mexican radio. Amazing."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant for lunch, arrived at 12:20pm and the place had a decent amount of people. The service was very friendly and polite and was happy to service our drinks. Would very much like to return and on the place side everyone is bilingual with English and Spanish. The drinks tasted great!"}
{"text":"Walking around Kensington one day my friend and I decided to check this place out.  The patio was full so we went inside.  It's a pretty big restaurant that can accommodate large groups.  It looked happening and the menu looked interesting so we decided to stop in for a small bite.  Maybe it's just me and old age and losing taste buds, but I felt there was no flavour in anything I had here.  We got the guac and chips to share.  The guac tasted pretty bland, no freshness or even salt to the dish.  The chips however were pretty decent.  I ordered the Rojas tamales...ehhh.  That pretty much sums up that dish.  No flavour, no heat, no nothing. Service was a bit slow as some of our dishes came out a tad too slow."}
{"text":"The tacos are all pretty much okay and the price is affordable. It's authentically Mexican including their hours. They may or may not be open. Good luck."}
{"text":"I only get food from here as a last resort of me not wanting to cook Mexican food, I always regret. I have visited this place since 2013 when I used to live in Kensington, and it was overpriced considering their counterparts. Since then a lot of places had close, but this place remain opens because of their ridiculous prices and low quality service, it's tasteless, they never get your order right, and good luck getting salsa or lemons with any of the dishes (basic Mexican sides)."}
{"text":"I only tried one dish, so maybe my lack of understanding for the negative reviews comes from there. Wonderful service - the friendly gentleman taking my order made sure no meat based products would end up in my dish, abd even then I waited less than 10 min on a busy day.   The cactus enchiladas I ordered were delicious, with a subtle kick and simple but perfectly melded flavors. Really loved the tortillas! Tasted unbelievably authentic."}
{"text":"I don't think I can add anymore negativity than what's already been said by others. So I'll be brief and to the point. You really don't need to eat here unless if you have been forced to.  Here are there reason's why.  - The waitresses are inattentive and not very helpful or friendly - The food was dry, dry and dry and not very flavourful - The selection is mediocre - No liquor license - Prices are alright"}
{"text":"Wasn't really great.  Price didn't really justify the quality or portions of the food.  We got an assortment of foods off the menu, and everything really lacked flavour, even using the salsa verde (which also was really meh). The different meat options for their different tacos/quesadillas were so dry. The whole time I was begging for water, in which the waitress didn't bother to refill.   Was really surprised at the end when it came to pay, didn't realize how much it added up towards the end, despite the quality.  Much better locations up the street."}
{"text":"Great food. Veggie enchiladas superb.  Great staff. Fish tacos were as fresh as fresh can be. Chilaquiles really good and authentic.  Wonderful little place."}
{"text":"Best lunch I've had in a long time. Guac and chips to start, tacos, horchata and churros. The best."}
{"text":"Extraordinary tacos, some of the best guacamole around, and a laid back, homey atmosphere makes this spot a great one for some soul foodery."}
{"text":"Great patio seating, friendly staff. The ceviche and sips azteca were authentic and delicioso. Also love the tribute to zapata and villa. Teach us more! Give us a story on the back of your menu! I will return!"}
{"text":"The food was so delicious but very spicy! :) Everything was so well done! The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was great. Loved everything, especially the churros!!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place 3 times, and it's a definite meh.  Each time I've gone here, the food has been passable at a best. Considering how many other latin restaurants are in the area, this place really needs to solve this problem. Compared to its competitors in Kensington, this place falls short.   On this particular occasion, I ordered a burrito. Compared to Salsa's down the street, this burrito doesn't even come close. What's more, Pancho & Emiliano's (P&E) burrito costs $7.63, whereas Salsa's costs $5.65. That's 40% more, and Salsa's burrito tastes significantly better. It is clear that P&E has spent quite a significant amount of money on the renovations, which is why they are charging more, but if your burrito is this much more expensive than the competitor, it should at the very least taste as good, if not better.  The burrito itself had about 3/4 of a cup of rice in it (gross), and a tortilla that was way too big for the contents. I had to open it up, take most of the rice out, and rip off 1/4 of the tortilla. This is not something I should have to do.   The meat is probably of better quality than other competitors in the market, but the combination of ingredients and spices was just off, and left me unimpressed.   What's more, this place takes too long to get your food ready. At other places in the market which are way busier, it takes them much less time. It took 15-20 minutes on average the last 2 times I came here.    About the only thing good about this place is their patio. It is at a prime spot in Kensington Market (on the corner of Augusta & Baldwin). If you're more into having a beer and a snack, and care more about being on a nice patio than what your food tastes like then this place might not be a bad place to check out.   Also, the staff is quite nice, friendly, and helpful.   For people who live in or near Kensington Market, we are truly spoiled with how good the food options are. A place like this really needs to get up to speed with the quality of their dishes, or I can't see them lasting very long."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the negative reviews.  We found this place as a happy accident and it's a favorite now!   Cactus salad is a rare find done this light and refreshing.  The dressing is perfect.  I ordered it with a vegan tamal, which I ate together, along with the guac and chips.  They will bring two bottles, a green and a reddish hot sauce.. Green is for the adventurous but they both add a nice kick to the tamales.  I thought the prices were terrific: a $5 tamal and a $6 salad and I was stuffed. We had great service.  The waitress was young and very sweet for such a terribly hot day, and an older woman checked on is three times to see if we liked our food. (It was around 3:00 pm on a Saturday, outside tables full)  The food comes out as it is prepared vs altogether.. I don't know if that bothered other reviewers but I prefer it that way: hot and fresh.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Okay, here goes.  I have been to this place 3 times.  Love the space and the patio, love the food, love the owner.  First time I went with my partner on a Saturday and we both got green chili tamales and they were delicious.  Second visit was on a Friday and we took a friend from Texas who happens to be hispanic, and we each got something different to share.  I got the fish tacos, which were fantastic.  My partner got 2 different tamales, which were moist a delicious.  And our friend got a ceviche tostada which was amazing.  Our 3rd visit was this past Sunday and we were slightly disappointed.  The tamales were dry this time and tasted as if they had just been reheated....I am assuming the owner/ chef was not in.  I did have some very tasty barbacoa tacos on this visit though, so not a complete loss.  I have made a mental note to not go here on Sunday's b/c of the last meal....but all and all the place is an amazing spot to eat some real mexican food and people watch. (in case you were wondering, my partner is half mexican and both of our families hail from mexico)"}
{"text":"Número uno: chocolate caliente  MUY caliente, MUY bien! This restaurant definitely set a new standard for hot chocolate, especially for a cold winters day in Toronto. Using a special Mexican recipe for hot chocolate, I feel as if I'm drinking the perfect blend of a hot drink with melted dark chocolates. The taste is amazing, the sweetness is on point. Will be coming back regularly."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed when I sat for dinner on Sunday night.   First, this is an alcohol-free restaurant. I wasn't going to drink anyway, but they should advertise this, and they don't. The table next to me left when they were told. It also has NO ICE. What's that about!?  I ordered a cheese-filled tamale, but the cheese was minimal. It was more of a roasted pepper tamale with a hint of cheese.  The carnitas (pork) tacos were bland and exceedingly dry. No amount of green chili sauce helped.  The patio is a prime location for people-watching in Kensington Market. That's all this place has going for it.  Oh...also, no refried beans...and the server brought me the wrong bill."}
{"text":"While wandering in Kensington, we decided to try this big fancy looking restaurant, the interior is pretty attractive. We ordered soups to begin, but our server tried to push to order nachos/ guac etc and also the main course at once, but we had ample to time, so we thought to take it slow & Thank God!  I ordered veggie tomato - tortilla soup.  The soup was tasteless, there was no salt, no flavour or not even the tangy taste of tomatoes. I asked the server for salt when she came to ask if everything was okay. And guess what? she just went away to take orders from another table, while I still was waiting for her to come back and get me the salt, but she totally ignored me again! So I had to get up and get it myself. I somehow ate the half bowl, I couldn't eat the full bowl of that faded soup. The salsas were too flat as well, it seemed they were watered- down. I found the place expensive even before I tried the food as compared to other eateries in the vicinity.  So you would guess,  how I felt afterwards!"}
{"text":"Want authentic Tacos? This is the place to go in Kensington Market! Try the Taco al Pastor, best I've had outside of the upscale Mexican places in the city."}
{"text":"I ordered two different dishes that looked and tasted absolutely the same. Maybe it was just a bad luck choice, but overall I was not impressed. I left most of the food in the plate and went to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant but you may need to squeeze yourself between the wobbly tables and hope to goodness you won't spill your neighbours drinks. The tables are also very short especially if you're sitting on the benches rather than the chairs. It was a somewhat uncomfortable dining experience.   The service is ok, you may need to wave a few times for water refills!   As for the food, it is quite good. We got the Enchiladas ($13) which was decent and filling! We also got the Chicken Tinga Tostadas ($6), which was ok. The chicken is quite bland, but there was a small kick of spicy that made it better.   Wish the portions were a tad bigger, especially for its price.  There are definitely better (flavourful) places around Kensington to try first!"}
{"text":"Ice cold beer .. amazing fresh homemade guacamole .and cool little spot in Kensington market first of my many stops on my Toronto vacation  or I would have ordered more .as the place came past my table I was admiring the dishes coming out of the kitchen"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! I've been to mexico a number of times and it's near impossible to find close to authentic mexican food.   This place is by far the closest to authenticiy that i have found. The staff all came from mexico, everything is made fresh, and the portion sizes are very fair.   I had the baja fish tacos. DO NOT BE TURNED OFF BY THE PRICE!!! It is marked as 2 tacos for $16 or something like that. When i got my meal, the tacos were huge. I ended up cuting the fish peices in half and making 4 tacos.   I highly reccomend you try this place if you like mexican food.!   GS27"}
{"text":"Any restaurant in Kensington should be good cause the place itself gives great vibes and all the things that I have tried there has been best. Thinking on same terms I tried Pancho and was expecting great Mexican experience. I was that very impressed with the food as it did not surprise me. I was expecting some customized signature salsa and it was basic. Hope to see new stuff in the menu and live up to expectations of Kensington.  We tried tacos and burritos and both were pretty normal. Staff is really good and they take care of clients really well."}
{"text":"The \"pozole\" is a must, real Mexican flavours. The only thing to improve is the lack of beer ;)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars really. My Mexican friend wanted to take me to El Trompo but we foolishly didn´t realize it closed early on Sunday evenings.  Luckily Pancho y Emiliano is open a bit later.  Now, my friend is from Monterrey in Mexico and has been in Toronto for 4 months learning English. In that time, he has basically eaten at every single Mexican restaurant in the city 2 or 3 times each. He refuses to eat any other ethnic foods which is a shame.   His opinion is that Pancho y Emiliano is mediocre. My opinion is that it is better than most Mexican places in Toronto. What it lacks in authenticity, it makes up for in trendiness, decor and cool patio.   The prices were decent, two tacos and a rice and beans side for $9. The tacos were big too, loaded up unlike the little tiny things you get at Grand Electric and other fusion type places.   My food was quite good, I had no complaints whatsoever. Mr Mexico says their salsas are not hot enough."}
{"text":"Appetisers arrive \"whenever\": my husband's ceviche (tasty!) arrived in a timely fashion but my cactus salad (eventually very fresh and delicious) didn't arrive until after our main courses of tacos al pastor and Baja fish tacos, all very tasty. But I said I didn't want my salad anymore since it was so late and I was now eating my tacos but the waiter said I had to take it and could not cancel the order. Then he kept staring daggers at me as I ate the salad which made me uneasy about my food. My husband ate most of it though: hope we both survive."}
{"text":"My wife & I visited Toronto this past Easter weekend & discovered Pancho Y Emiliano. Wow! What a find!!! I'm a huge \"Tamale\" snob, so there's no tolerance for bad tamales, & Pancho's tamales, with that lovely flavorful bit of \"heat\", are beyond scrumptious!!! The margaritas were not \"North Americanized\", & you could actually taste the tequila. The staff were totally charming & on point. For all you foodies out there, this place is a keeper, big time!"}
{"text":"Cute little spot with a good patio. The food unfortunately is flavourless and extremely overpriced for what you get.   Better to go to seven lives if you're in the mood for some tacos."}
{"text":"This a long overdue post, I went to Pancho Y Emiliano back in April. It's one of the many Mexican restaurant that enter the Kensington Market scene. It's named after two Mexican revolutionary heroes, Villa and Zapata and it strives for an authentic taste.  Ceviche Tostadas $4.75 ~ Great start to the meal, it was fresh with the perfect amount of \"citrus\" but I wished that it had a little more fish cause depending on which bite you took, there was more lettuce and avocado than fish.  Chili Ajo Pork Tamales $3.75 ~ This was the 1st thing that caught my eye and they were perfect.  ~ The pork is melt in your mouth richly flavored goodness warped with equally flavorful corn masa (dough)  Fish Taco $5.75 ~ There was a gigantic piece of lightly battered and freshly fried fish which is moist and buttery.  ~ No fancy presentation but true yummy flavor with the creamy sauce, guacamole and salsa fresca. ~ Simple, fresh and delicious.    Pork Pastor Burrito $6.75  Churros $1.50/ea ~ Made fresh, this was crispy on the outside and still soft and pillowy inside. ~ Let's just say I like this better than the one next door where it's way mas-produced   Verdict : ~ Will love to come back since I enjoyed everything here ~ Wish it was a tad quicker, there was people waiting and they took way too long to take their order that they left."}
{"text":"Another patio in Kensington, another place for me to park it on the regular.   Go inside, place your order and pay and go back out and soak up some sun while you wait for some authentic Mexican treats. I thoroughly enjoyed my veggie burrito, though it needed some kicking up from the table hot sauce. My partner's fish burrito was more fried and flavourful and I'll go that route next time. There will be a next time!"}
{"text":"I am very picky when it comes to Mexican food, and this place was just okay. We ordered chips & guac, an order of fish tacos, and a few other tacos (a chicken and a pork, IIRC). The fish tacos were definitely the best of the bunch, but the meat in the other tacos was a little on the dry side for my taste. Once we added a little more lime to the guac, it was good too, but could have used a little more pizzazz."}
