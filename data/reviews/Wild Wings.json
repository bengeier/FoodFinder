{"text":"I used Skip the Dishes to have my order delivered.   I ordered 4lbs of Classic wings,  with different flavours.   I will say that, unfortunately, I didn't like any of it.   The wings had more bone than meat and were overcooked.  It tasted flash fried and dry.  I'm still searching for a good wings place in Brampton and Wild Wings was a very big disappointment."}
{"text":"The wings and fries were okay. 2.5 stars for food. The thing that bothered us most was the cleanliness. The salt shaker had hair on it and was sticky. - we didnt use it - Waitress brought another one but salt was hard and stuck to the bottom. Icky vibe the rest of the time. Easy fix would be to regularly clean things customers touch. Wont return."}
{"text":"If I could rate this location a zero star, that would be an understatement. This place deserves a negative star rating. Like minus two or three stars. This is the kind of place that needs an episode of Bar Rescue. Went there for some wings and drinks with my girlfriend. When we got there, we were greeted by a couple of coke dealers asking if we wanted coke or crack. This should've been our cue to leave, but decided to give the place a try anyways. Got inside and was told by a server who was on her way outside to pick a place to sit and a server would be with us in a min. All the tables were moved to sides to make a dance floor that nobody was using. There was a DJ in the corner by the entrance playing music so loud it was impossible to have any kind of conversation. Not a single waitress acknowledged us for 10 minutes. They were too busy talking and drinking with customers at the bar. When the server FINALLY came to take our order, I placed our order and went to the bathroom only to be harassed by ANOTHER fucking drug dealer. Ordered some wings, a glass of Canadian, and a rum and coke no ice. The only thing they got right was the wings, but that's pretty hard to fuck up since it's a WINGS place. The server fucked up the rest of our order though. I got a glass of some other kind of beer in a nasty glass. Sent that back in exchange for a bottle. Kinda hard to fuck that up you'd think. Nope. Got a bottle of blue. The \"rum and coke\" no ice was a glass of coke with ice. Sent that back and ordered a bottle of coors. No dice again. Got a bottle of bud. Sent all the drinks back, finished the wings and left. I'll never return to this location ever again."}
{"text":"One of the best places to order wings from with such a huge selection of sauces. First time ever we dined in at this location rather than doing take out. Aside from the good quality chicken and food the service was poor, our server seemed as if she was annoyed with us. Anyways I always get the hometown hottie sauced up wings, it's my absolute favourite flavour. I've had the buffalo spicy fries, poutine, and spicy gar par fries and none are disappointing.   The food is 5 stars but had to knock it down to 4 stars because of the service and awkward crowded seating. Sorry."}
{"text":"Came here twice with the same group of 5. Both of our experiences at this location were horrible. We should have learned after the first time we came, never to come back here again. After this second visit, we all agreed to go elsewhere since the service was just horrible.  Upon arrival, the owner approached us to sit down at a table that had 4 seats. I said there was 5 of us and he said he'll pull another table and chair for the 5th person. Once the 4 of us sat down, the owner then walked away to serve another table, leaving the 5th member of our group standing awkwardly beside our table. We actually had to grab a chair from an empty table since nobody seemed to help us after our group member stood for minutes waiting. After about 15 minutes of looking at the menu, nobody came to check in with us. 5 minutes later, one of the waitresses came by and said she needed to cash out a few more tables then she will take our orders. Fine. After waiting another 5 minutes, the owner came by again and said \"sorry about the wait. The waitress will take your order once she is done cashing out other customers\" then proceeded to walk back to the bar and stand around to observe his full restaurant. Great teamwork you are showing, owner! Anyways, after some time, we decided to ask the owner when he passed by our table, if he could bring another table over so that 3 of us wouldn't have to squeeze and share one table. He went ahead and followed the request. After about a total of 20 minutes of waiting, our waitress finally came back and took our order. All of us ordered wings, 2 of us ordered pop to drink (1 pepsi, 1 iced tea) and the other 3 ordered water, and I also ordered a side of gravy. Another 15-20 minutes passed and our drinks finally came, but the waitress came with 2 iced teas instead of 1 iced tea and 1 pepsi (even after confirming twice that it was 1 pepsi and 1 iced tea). She said she would return with the other pepsi. Our food finally came after about 5 minutes receiving our drinks, but still no sign of that pepsi, and my gravy was missing. The owner passed by so we flagged him down to ask about the pepsi and my gravy. He brought the two right away.   The food was mediocre. I wish there was more sauce to my wings since some of them barely had sauce on it. The french fries seemed to be undercooked, and my gravy was cold, which was not appetising whatsoever.   Our waitress came to check on us once, which was fine considering that she seemed to be the only person working hard to keep the restaurant going out of the 3 servers that were there. Unfortunately, when we were ready to pay, there was no one to be found that my boyfriend had to walk up to the cash area and wait until someone helped him.   Lesson learned...we are not coming back here. Even after watching other customers and overhearing their experiences here and how the owner dealt with it (he actually didn't...he spoke to one of his waiter in the kitchen on how to deal with the situation/complaint) was just unacceptable as a business owner."}
{"text":"Went to sit and eat ordered the breaded mushrooms they were more breading than mushroom my friend ordered pickled Willy's she said they Were the worst she's ever tried then I ordered the eight chicken wings in the honey garlic sauce and fries with gravy I never got my gravy and the fries tasted like they were out of the bag and just like fried they tasted like they were stale and the chicken wings were good but they were very small the sauce was really good though and my friend ordered the pasta and she said it was so dry and tasteless will never be returning again"}
{"text":"Great food, mediocre service.  As usual the service was slow; there was only one person waiting tables and the bar.  They forgot the cutlery for the fries and boneless wings and it took a long time for the food to come out.  Once the food did arrive however it was pretty damn good. I had ordered the \"Jamaican me crazy\" flavour, which is a favourite of mine, and it was probably the best I've had.  This is neither the best or worst Wild Wing(s) location I've been to, but it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"The bartender was very nice and sociable and that makes a HUGE difference! Had a great time and great conversation."}
{"text":"This food is disgusting. The chicken wing sizes are hella small. Tastes and looks like it was cooked the day before. Their hottest sauce \"ring of fire\" should be labeled \"ring of sweet\", not hot at all. Terrible company cutting corners to make a profit."}
{"text":"Ordered wimgs to pick up.  Was told 15 minutes until they were ready.  Showed up on time and was told 10 minutes later that their cook made the food wrong and was starting over.  It is now 20 minutes from when we were promised that they would be ready.  Also I should point out that there are only 5 other people here.  This is unacceptable"}
{"text":"Well grabbed some dinner with my daughter after our movie and I was craving wings.  Craving not satisfied...  The food wasn't horrible but nothing amazing about it, it was alright.  It was wings lol I can't really brag much.  I love my wings battered, but I find wild wings overly battered, even for my liking.  The fries weren't even that great, I would probably ask them to cook it a little longer to get that crispness.  Our server was pleasant and attentive, so no complaints about her.  Not sure what else can be said...so I'm ending it here! Lol"}
{"text":"Ordered a POUTINE the other night (the good, the bad, and the ugly) and I seriously got a microwaved order of bacon cheese fries, with pickles, and gravy thrown on top. Seriously. SERIOUSLY. I ordered a full size POUTINE, too, and it was in a half size box but whatever.  The stryofoam box was obviously was microwaved, the fries were becoming apart of the box, and the bottom was all warped. (Don't try to tell me it was from putting the fries into the box-- I've worked in a kitchen before), it obviously tasted like crap, and I threw it out.. I didn't feel like ingesting Styrofoam was a good idea anyway.  I also had an order of catch me if you can wings, which were ....Very not right. Catch me if you can is maple, and extra hot... What I got wasnt spicy at all. Very tragic.  My sister works at another ww location, and couldn't believe what sort of food I was given. Sorry WW closest to my house, you will never have another nickel from me.   I would never recommend this location. The staff may be friendly, but, the kitchen guy ruined it all. Who sends out microwaved fries.. ??? Smh"}
{"text":"IM CURRENTLY SITTTING here on Friday at 12:15 am...  As soon as we walked in someone greeted us telling us they are not seating costumers only take out ... So my cousin and I questioned they said it was a slow day so they are closing the kitchen early. As we are sitting at the bar the server ( Sukh Sahota) was continunally rushing us to choose what we would like because the kitchen was closing .. it was only 12:15am they close at 1am. Furthermore as our food was being made the gentlemen beside us we're allowed to sit and eat there food ,but for some reason we have to leave ...they also turned away 2 potential costumers at 12:30am ..(This wild wings is suppose to close at 1am) . I don't know what type of service this was I give it ZERO STARS  ."}
{"text":"Sticky. The floor. The table. I stuck to both.  The food. The usual ho hum wild wings. Ecept for the over cook or double cooked hotdog served to my 2 year old daughter.  And the 15 minutes waiting for my server to check back. Then i waved the other server down and got attitude when I showed my displeasure with waiting.  Wont be back until new management/ownership cleans house."}
{"text":"This place needs help.  Not many of the taps are working and the food is horrible!  Waitresses seem to be in their own world instead of tending to the customers.   Not going back again."}
{"text":"I was there with my family and the service is so slow!  They have drawing placemats for the kids but no crayons.  I think  our food took about 30 minutes to come to us and it wasn't good at all!  I am not taking my family here again!"}
{"text":"It's an old and dainty building and the bathrooms were not the greatest. Wings were not bad but the fries were  a little stale. Staff were friendly and great though"}
{"text":"I visited this location only once for take out and they mixed up my order with someone else's. The wings were good (at best) and certainly not inexpensive. Average, fairly pricey food combined with the mixup made that one visit the only one here."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday around 5 service was really slow took them about an hour to get 2 baskets of wings out i probably wouldn't come here again"}
{"text":"I have never tried Wild Wings before, but after my friends suggestion I decided to order it for dinner today from skip the dishes. What an amazing experience. The wings were absolute perfection. We ordered the Canadian eh with no heat and the Sweet Smoke with no heat and they both were phenomenal. The wing quality was exceptional, it's not overly fatty or soaked in oil... you get lightly breaded and meaty pieces absolutely drenched in the most delectable sauce. I honestly cannot praise these Wings enough. The fries were incredibly oily and quite forgettable, but they're called Wild Wings not Wild fries so honestly couldn't be bother with the fries. Enjoyed the celery and carrot sticks that came with the meal, it helped to cut some of the richness between bites. This will certainly be a repeat order on many the occasion as these were the best wings I've had to date."}
{"text":"Decided to try this location on a whim. The wings were smaller than we're accustomed to from other Wild Wings locations but the flavors were there. In all a consistently good experience."}
{"text":"Food was ok although I don't think I got the full \"pound and a half\" like I ordered.    The  servers are always busy chit chatting it seems.  It took a long while after we were seated to get a menu."}
{"text":"Ridiculous service. I was there for almost 2 hours, and barely got half of what my family ordered, until we decided to just take our food to go. People were being served ahead of us, when we arrived long before them, and half the people there didn't have any food. Just water. Won't be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"One of the better locations in Brampton. The service is great. They have a couple rotational staff. They are always polite and accommodate my random orders. This location is a smaller one. But it's clean and well kept. I typically always get ring of fire with Garpar mix and an order of fries and gravy on the side. Wings anyone?"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was terrible. The wings were small like the wings you would get in the  frozen section at Pathmark or BJs. It was smothered in sauce. Sounds good right? NOTTTT! My friends didnt like the wings at all but still got the 30 wings thinkings it would be good because of the 100+ flavors they offer. The Calamari appetizer was nowhere near the taste or price of $9.95. It was skimpy and looked like it came from a frozen package. It tastes fishy too so wasnt pleasant for my friends to eat. I got a buffalo fried chicken sandwich which was mediocre. The bun was crispy and was actually expecting a salad after reading the description....Giving it one star because food was edible and not tasty and service was not attentive. Our original waiter left halfway through our dinner without telling us she was leaving which I felt was rude. Wouldnt go again."}
{"text":"Sat there for 10 minutes waiting for a menu and the waitresses were taking a selfie never going  back"}
{"text":"Went here today arrived at 7:00pm I had my order in by 7:10 didn't get my food until an hour later I'm typing as I wait to 7:58pm. It does not take an hour to make a burger. It was not even busy. The server was nice but the place STANK, disgusting. Never coming again.. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Decent WW. Went there after a busy day for lunch, sat down alone and had some spicy garpar wings. Was awesome with a beer. I gave a higher rating since the girl who was serving said she was working since 8-9am and didn't have breakfast, but she was still very polite, friendly, and served fast."}
{"text":"Waitresses often chatting with their friends instead of serving.  Crappy bear (tap) selection. Food is a gamble. You never know what you're going to get - usually pretty bad.  Friday nights, music is way too loud and the crowd is pretty scary. Lots of fights."}
{"text":"So I came here yesterday for dinner and forgot to review them. I'm easily giving it 5 stars, mainly because of the customer service. She was a Gemini (like me).. I asked.. God only knows why, lol.. but I did. Best customer service I've ever had for a simple restaurant and I go to even places that are suppose to be 5 star food and service but nothing compares to the amazing service she has given me. She made me a Bob Marley shot, which I've never had before and it was tasty. She made me a sex on the beach and it was amazing, I think it was my first time having it but I am not 100% sure because I've had plenty of drinks in my life and I never ask what it is.. I just say \"Mmm.. Yummy\" lolol, but yeah and the sweet escape wings were fantastic as always and I tried the Gar Par Fish Tacos.. they were decent but kind of tasted like cat fish, haha. Simple food, great service. I hope she's there if I ever decide to come to this location again. Am I falling in love with her? Perhaps, but honestly I genuinely Love It, when somebody gives me good service, even if the food is crap. The End, lol"}
{"text":"Wow. I've been to other wild wing locations and the food has been good. This place was horrible. The chicken wings (boneless) tasted like they had been cooked hours in advance and then reheated. We didn't finish our meal and did not take it home with us. I feel sick. If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Absolutely disgusting. Will not return and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Dropped in on a Saturday night....thankfully prior to the rush beginning.  We found a seat immediately and our server was over shortly thereafter, told us the wing/beer special, took our drink order and off she went. When she returned, we ordered our dinner and some appetizers. Appetizers were Mac and cheese triangles...absolutely the greasiest, worst tasting item I've ever put in my mouth at a restaurant. Potato skins were very dry...no flavour at all. Some of us ordered the wing dinner, which was wings, fries and a soft drink (no refills). The fries came out as an appetizer...not with the wings. They were basic fries and pretty flavourless. When our food came out, it came out at different times. 2 people got their order (one was a wing dinner and the other a burger dinner) while a 3rd was returned because the person who brought out the wings could not tell us which type of wings they were. She said she would be right back with them, but she answered a phone and talked on it for an awfully long time. 10 minutes later, those wings were brought back out, with the other 3 wing orders. WTF? Wings were a huge disappointment. While meaty, they were sprinkled with minimal sauce....no  flavour at all. We would have sent them back but we never saw our waitress until 20 minutes later....she was serving other tables, on the phone, settling bills, etc.  We will not go back"}
{"text":"Do not ever go here late at night. I had a craving for some wings around 11 so me and the gf came here.   The wings: Pretty decent. Just like how I would expect them to be. Which is why it's not one star  The atmosphere: well I had to use the restroom so I ended up walking into a transaction happening in the bathroom between two gentlemen of the illegal kind. Obviously can't blame management except these gentlemen came out and were talking to the waitress because it seems they knew her. Me and the gf quietly ate as one of the men went to the bathroom again with a woman who seemed to be wearing children's clothing as they were too small for her and not exactly covering her. The waitress would come see us every once in a while before going to the front and shouting at one of her friends about his lack of payment and tip. All in all I think I'd rather get wings to go instead."}
{"text":"Entered restaurant and it was 60 percent full for a small restaurant.  Waitresses seem disorganized. Tables were gritty.  Food took a long time to come out.  Boneless wings were Refried and had to be sent back. Nacho app, poutine, and loaded potato skins came after wings were long finished.  They forgot my son's hot dog order too.  Things have really changed.  Seems like they just took over this restaurant."}
