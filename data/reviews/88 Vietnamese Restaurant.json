{"text":"Pho is about a authentic soup base, fresh crunchy noodles, and the quality of meats they put in. Well this place has them all. And given the longevity of this place (opened for at least 20 years I think), and an upscale renovation some time ago that still lasted like new, this place will make you want to go back all the time. I've tried a lot of different styles of pho here, spicy or non, with no disappointment. Also their roast chicken breast with rice smells and tastes awesome. Here and there I would also try their red bean drink with coconut milk too. This is one of the most genuine Vietnamese food amongst a handful of other ones I've tried in Toronto. Prices are very reasonable. Service is acceptable.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"As a native Viet, I honestly think I can be overly harsh when it comes to some Pho or any Vietnam restaurants in general but honestly, I think I am rather fair this time.  Honestly just plainly talking, this place sucks in every single way possible.  

The service here is horrible, as soon as you walk in, you aren't greeted and find a table yourself.  You then wait probably 10 minutes for someone to come actually give you menus.  None of the waiters are fluent in Viet and are pretty young so I learned to not even bother saying the actual name of my orders rather the numbers since last time I did that, they got my order wrong.  I tried asking to confirm their mistake since I know I clearly said \"Pho Bo Vien\" but I was given a Pho Bo Tai, and they argued saying that I ordered wrong... Your eating utensils are given to you not only wrapped in a paper towel but generously taped so you have to struggle your way into pulling apart the forks and spoons.  Also, we were given an odd number of chopsticks, woo! Also, in terms of beverages they forgot one of my mango smoothies. This was the end to my first visit.... As I came for another visit, it was relatively busier this time so the wait seemed reasonable.  While my wondering eyes moved around the room, I noticed that the table beside us got the wrong order and the staff were trying to assist them.  After we received our food, I then notice the manager yelling at one of the staff at the cashier; I'm sorry but I'd like to eat in peace tyvm.  Ok moving on...

The food here is average I'd say, the vermicelli was pretty good with nice touches here and there.  The chow mien was crispy, and the Pho is alright.  I'd probably give 3 stars if the service wasn't so bad.  Anyways, now I know I won't be returning as the service isn't worth my money."}
{"text":"I have tried the pork vermicelli with spring rolls a couple of times and can't complain. The pho dishes are also good, and the portions are huge for Pho."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. Worst restaurant ever. 

 The food is over priced, the staff is rude, the kitchen is filthy dirty and the portions are a rip off. 

A typical chow mein seafood plate has 2 small shrimps and tasteless. I asked for an explanation on why there are so few pieces of seafood the waiter and manager seemed annoyed and said they use little seafood. 

I will never ever go here. I hope they enjoy the 0.01 cent tip.

I would give the place 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"What can't I say about this place.

It's a 15 minute drive from the office and we go for lunch.  We aren't government workers so 2 hour lunches are not tolerated.  This shows you the dedication to the restaurant.

The Pho is awesome!!!  Their spring rolls are good and the sauce is tasty.

The Pho comes in three sizes and with any combination of meats.  I have eaten pho all over the place and this one is def top 5 if not top top due to the freshness, quality, flavor, and speed.  (read note about lunch and not a union or gov. worker)
:)

Place kicks ass!"}
{"text":"We used to come here more often when we lived in Mississauga.  i find the food to be mediocre but their pho ga is okay.  If you ask for fresh noodles they'll serve your pho with them.  We ordered the shrimp salad rolls and they were not fresh and the peanut sauce tasted coconutty.  Not my cup of tea.  The restaurant looks nice when you first walk in but once you're seated you realize how dirty it is.  The washrooms stink of urine so if I absolutely have to pee I will use them, or else I avoid them altogether.  I've never been a fan of black decor because to me it seems you're trying to hide your dirtyness if there is such a word."}
{"text":"This Pho place looks nice, but the quality does not match. And when I tried to order the Black Milk Tea he asked me what flavor. I told him just Plain Black Milk Tea. He told me that would taste funny, so i said forget it. Who in the HELL hasn't heard of plain black bubble tea...especially when it's ON THEIR MENU!!!! Ugh. Don't talk to me like I don't know what I'm talking about just because I'm white. I clearly no more about asian foods and drinks than you. huge pet peeve."}
{"text":"I have a very mixed opinion about this place. We tried the vermicelli with spring roll and pork and it was terrible.  The spring roll was awful, shredded pork is $1 extra and the pork was nothing to write home about. The rice with grilled pork was poor as well. I did not like the pork and they didn't give the standard tomato either. Portions were smaller than usual as well.

What saves this place is the amazing pho and the really nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place every few weeks for almost 5 years. Lately, I've been trying to figure out if I just got used to a higher quality of food and service since moving to Toronto or if this place is just going to hell in a hand basket. Either way, it's pretty dodgy now. Ingredients aren't fresh and that makes me really wonder what's going on in the kitchen..."}
