{"text":"Worst food and service ever. My boyfriend took one bite of their so called steak sandwich and said dog food. My boyfriend is nicer than I am. Seriously, I doubt my cat would've eaten it. What really got me however was the fact that when we politely informed the staff we were questioned 3 times about why it wasn't good. Now, I could have been straight up honest and flat out rude about it but it not our style. The man who questioned us could have been a manager but since he never identified himself he could have been anyone. I suggest the zipps staff eat it themselves and find out exactly why it's worthy of sending back. Don't bother when in the same complex there are truly excellent places to spend your money."}
{"text":"Good burgers.  Good beer selection.  A great happy hour that goes to 7.  What more do you need?

I love the burgers.  They're pretty cheap, cooked right, and served with a choice of wonderfully greasy onion rings, fries, sweet potato chips, half and half of any two, or a salad."}
{"text":"Frequent customer to this location. 
I was denied seating at the only available table, a six top, because my party of two was not large enough (they were full, but no waiting list). The hostess asked if I could \"get more people?\". She said I could sit in the bar which was overfilled or the patio instead. 
I said no to the patio and said I would be happy to sit at the bar if she could find seating for us (there was none). She stared at me blankly, confusion. I then asked if we should leave instead of being seated at the available table, response was silence. Just a blank stare. We turned and left.
As we drove off to find another sports bar I decided to call and let a manager know that I was displeased. I called and spoke to Jason. Jason said he heard the entire exchange and that it was my fault because I didn't give them a chance. 
I assume Jason is one of the owners children, no other explanation for someone that inept hanging on to a management position anywhere. My wife, son and I will no longer be seen at Zipp's. Way to go Jason!

Side note-
Zipps- Please listen- your patio is a nasty smoke hole. No one that isn't smoking or with a smoker would sit out there. I would love to kick it on the patio when the weather is nice, but you've sold the entire space to smokers, so not very friendly to anyone else out there. (Not bashing on smokers, Zipps says it's a smoking section so no foul on you)."}
{"text":"I think they have the worst fries ever.. always soggy and taste like old grease.. always. The fryer isn't hot enough and they over load them probably"}
{"text":"Great drink specials and food!  Service is outstanding too!  Love Ashley, Bailley, and Kalie!  They always take care of us!"}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday for lunch, hungry for burgers. The restaurant was about 1/4 full, wait staff was minimal.  Waitress acknowledged us right away, we placed our drink order (water and iced tea) which she brought promptly.  She was crazy busy taking care of what seemed like the entire dining room by herself.  We ordered two turkey burgers, one with a side salad one with onion rings, and then the 23 minute wait began for our food.  When the burgers arrived, it was the most sad looking display of food I have ever seen.  Turkey burgers were about 4 inches in diameter, 1/4 thick on a very bland white bun with a thin slice of pink tomato, old piece of lettuce and yellow \"red\" onion.  The onion rings were so disgusting, I couldn't even take bit.  The breading was a grayish brown, they were cold and just horrible looking. The turkey burger itself had a weird taste and we couldn't eat them.  The only thing that was pleasant about our experience was the waitress.  Never, ever, ever again will we go to the Zipp's in Chandler."}
{"text":"Good place to go after shopping to get a quick bite with the family, this place was surprisingly family friendly and inexpensive. Our waitress was sweet and prompt. She recommended the chicken quesadilla and it was really good. I wish I would've tried the wings though after seeing other reviews."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  Service was adequate at best. 
Ordered the tuna salad.   The tuna was very good, but was sitting on a bed of brown iceberg.  Not just a little brown, but very brown. How did this even get to the  table ???
When I pointed it out to the server, she apologized and then walked away.   No offer to fix the situation in any way.  
The wings were very good though, so not a total loss."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been waiting for Zipps to come to Ahwatukee for a very long time - we are sooo excited that they have finally opened up in our neighborhood. Being open for one week, we have been their twice and the experience has been great both times. We went on opening night and were amazed at how well trained the staff was.

The nightly drink and food specials make it a great stop after work!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner and to watch a game. Was there eating and drinking the entire game . With 3 minutes to go in our game, they turned the channel to accommodate a table of two who just arrived so they could watch a hockey game. Terrible move, we will pick a different sports bar next time."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had and will never go back.  I hope the franchisee goes bankrupt.  They think that just because you come there to have a drink you should think they are God.   The people in there could care less about you.  Had to clear my own table to sit down, helped clear the table when I left.  Had to summon the waitress over when I wanted another drink.  We were one of three three tables in the restaurant on a Saturday night but the incompetent people in there treated us like shit and then the bartender tried to call us out for leaving a poor tip.  I'm sorry but you are in a SERVICE INDUSTRY and if you don't service me, you don't deserve a tip.  Tips are earned, not deserved.  If you want a tip, work for it.  I hope the owner contacts me and I will tell them I'll never be back.  They thrive on shitty service and good tips from drunk people but as soon as people pay for what they get they have a problem.  Worst place ever!!!"}
{"text":"Really BAD. Had the chicken and beef tacos. Disgusting. Grease grease grease.. The beef is the cheapest I've ever had. Ground chicken. Simply yuck. The waitress handed us our check with someone elses info for their name and e-mail address inside. I mentioned it to her but she didn't really seem to care. Save your stomache, taste buds and personal info. This place is a NO-GO for us."}
{"text":"I have had two experiences at the 16th st. Zipps. The first was great because our server was very nice and on top of things and the second was terrible because the server was very unpleasant. Burgers were priced right and the food was good. I would go again and hope for the first server!"}
{"text":"Good location, nice atmosphere good prices big 32 oz beers. Good bar food. Friendly staff. Lots of TVs."}
{"text":"We came here for football Sunday.  Breakfast only until 11.  They serve wings over potatoes for breakfast, but won't serve wings by themselves because they're on the lunch menu...huh???  Ok...can I do a salad?  You know rabbit food in a bowl?  That can't be too much.  You know some lettuce?  Nope, we can't do that because it's in the lunch menu!!!  Wth?  Manager comes over...our kitchen can't accommodate 1 otherwise we have to do it for all...seriously you have 10!  10 people in your establishment on football Sunday!  That's the problem...your customer service sucks!  It's not management at the stores it's the ownership higher up management!  Sad, sad, sad!  Just wanted some damn rabbit food!"}
{"text":"We are servers as well. We had our work shirts on for the establishment we worked for. The second we walked in the server on the bar side rolled her eye just because she was getting sat. Mind you this was 11:15 and they close at 2. She came up to us. We ordered beers. I had my passport but she denied me and involved her manager to kick us out. She judged us right when we walked into the door. We always tip over 25%. She was really rude and snotty... She didn't even say her name. First thing she said was, drinks? She's probably jumping up and down that she doesn't have another table right now. We understand. We're in th same industry, but if you're that unhappy.. Change it. Please."}
{"text":"The wings here are delicious and they have great specials!  I had the medium golden wings and they were pretty great. Also a 32oz Blue Moon on a Wednesday is a great deal. The bar tender was pretty nice as well!"}
{"text":"Oh...my...gawd...the pepperoni pizza with goat cheese is amazzzzzing!!! Sit at the bar and come see Dayna!!! Best customer service ever!!! (And she's HOT too!)"}
{"text":"Game night, this is the place to be. Green chili burger, medium gold wings and pitchers are my favorite. Lisa is great bartender too!"}
{"text":"The volume at the bar blows!!!!! It's march madness and the speaker volume simply sucks!!!

But the beer is delicious"}
{"text":"zipps is a sports bar.  Zipps serves the need of providing sporting entertainment and food/beer.   

Today, Ryan the manager opted to keep the sound on Barwide for the third day of the US Open (a golf tournament) as opposed to turning on the Sound for the World Cup - England v Italy  

2 complete tables left.   10 patrons total.  

We talked to our waitress.  We talked to Ryan the manager.   She was powerless and he refused to change the channel.  More patrons then left.   The people around us were upset.   With 4 sports bars within 2 miles  - Four Peaks, Twin Peaks, KO O'donnell and Temple Bar so close why ever go back?

Ryan the manager was apathetic at best.....

Seriously, the World Cup - and this is not debatable - is the biggest sporting event in the world.   Except at Zipps \"Sports\" Bar in Scottsdale.    Sad."}
{"text":"I cannot not write a review about Zipps, especially because my jaw literally dropped to see it did not have a five star yelp rating. Seriously? This place is the best.

Apparently the naysayers have not tried their chicken skewers with golden medium sauce. CLEARLY, they have also not enjoyed said skewers with a giant beer for like $4! It must be that they didn't get a side of onion rings or even a freaking side salad at this place! If they came, it must have been during a blackout because they have such a great TV set up. Those giant TVs that merge together to form one mega giant TV? They must have been facing towards a wall instead.  Also they must have come during the like one hour that Zipps is not running a happy hour special.

This place is a god send for the Ahwatukee community. Its a total hit. Apparently their actual customers are not reviewing this place because seriously it is PACKED any time any event happens. It has a great atmosphere and is consistent. 

Really, they don't pay me to say this. I am just an epic Zipps fan who enjoys the finer things in life with a ball game on, a cold beer in one hand and a chicken skewer in the other. Life at Zipps is life well spent."}
{"text":"Our first time here and no one has come to our table to ask if we need anything they are very rude"}
{"text":"Have been here several times with my girlfriend and my husband.  Food is always good.  Burgers are especially great with half fries and half rings.  Servers are always attentive and friendly.  Atmosphere has a nice respite from the outside blistering heat.  Cool and dark."}
{"text":"Wings are great.
Awesome place to go and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"This place is so cheap! Great servers, very attentive. Great place to watch football games, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were excited to move into the neighborhood and find a bar and grill so close to our house!  That was short-lived.  They have an outdoor patio, but no service.  Let me rephrase with the longest run-on sentence ever:  They start out serving you and then disappear so you end up standing in the middle of the dining room with empty baskets of food and empty cocktails while 10 servers and 2 bartenders are running around you completely ignoring you until a patron at the bar offers to move over a bit so you can put stuff down and then you proceed to stand there waiting for more cocktails when the bartender comes over, looks at the empty baskets with a perplexed look on her face but still doesn't look up to take my order or even ask if I'd like anything and now it's been 20 minutes (not kidding) of standing in the bar being ignored. 

Taking a breath...

The patio doesn't have misters or heaters either.  My hubby is a smoker so we always seek out comfortable smoking patios.  Boooooo on this one.  We have been to the Zipp's at 16th and Bethany and their patio is awesome, except for the picnic tables.  

The drinks were short, not much booze unless you are a regular there apparently but the food is consistent and fairly good for bar food.  Love the chicken skewers."}
{"text":"I was in here high as a kite........and so I got a beer i....I don't remember the rest ..how the fuck did I get home?"}
{"text":"FABULOUS!  Service is great and Miss Amber in he bar is dedicated and on her toes!! This was our second time there and Amber totally made us feel at home. She has a beautiful smile and nobody should feel uninvited by her. She was awesome"}
{"text":"Fries and onion rings were soggy and just plain gross. Was told sorry. What happened to the twice cooked fries?"}
{"text":"I've brought a group of about 30 people in here today impromptu and we've commandeered about all of the back half of the restraunt. Our one server is amazing and busting her ass to serve us on this crazy busy world cup day, I've been to many different zipps in the valley many different times and this is by far the best. And best service I've ever had at one even in this crazy busy day.  Props to our server Jessica she's a rockstar! I downloaded yelp today just because of how impressed I was with how well this girl handled my rowdy group!!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Thank God Zipps is in south Chandler! Great food and great atmosphere. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Every time i go to this establishment I feel a mild neglect like a stray unwanted dog that roams on your front lawn. There is only one server that is actually attentive but everyone else is never around. The building is nice and new and thats about the best thing I have to say about it. The Swizzle Inn across the street has been there sense jesus walked the earth and its old and looks creepy but it blows Zipps out of the water.There is a few bars on that corner and they are all better. If I could I would give it no stars. If you work in the food and beverage industry customer service is key to success. The food can be crap and over priced but if they take care of you alls well. Stay away from this joint unless you like being ignored."}
{"text":"If I could have put zero stars I would have. Service was subpar. Asked for a booth and gave us a table when there where plenty of booths open. Not sure If the place was racist or just incompetent. Told server I had a problem, but ignored it and laughed it off. Will never return. Horrible service. Stay away."}
{"text":"I am normally a big fan of this place however I have been there twice this week and the service was horrible both times.  The food was undercooked and also cold both times.   I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Mediocre food not very fresh and service was decent.  Chopped salad lettuce with bits of bacon.  Gordon Ramsey's kitchen nightmares or Bar rescue needs to show up."}
{"text":"Well I gave them another shot. If the manager is reading this. Get out on the floor and talk to your customers and make sure things are getting done. 
Service started out good then waited 15 min for the check. OnionI rings were cold. Burger good. Kids tacos were ground beef with no seasoning.  
They just seem to not want to try at this place."}
{"text":"Went to watch Euro 2016 Croatia vs Portugal we asked the manager to turn up the volume for the game  he said there were not enough people watching the game we had a party of 7 
There were maybe 30 total people in the bar. 
The manager was aloof borderline rude and reluctantly came to our table. 
We left to watch the game at Blue 32 who gladly turned up the volume. 
Done with Zips we have gone there for games in the past and spent thousands of dollars never again.  They call it a sports bar we had to listen to Knock on Wood instead of turning on the game. 
Saturday at 11:30 am"}
{"text":"I had their golden wings I was not impressed at all, and their ranch tasted like mayo it was the worse experience ever I mean the food took longer then I expected my bill was 22.00 dollars I paid 40 and the waitress took it upon herself to give herself a tip like without me even giving her a dollar amount are you kidding me where is the manager ASAP ...."}
{"text":"Totally mediocre. I'd just as soon go to Applebee's or chilis. Came here on a Saturday night for some preseason football, but they only had two games playing.  They got my order of wings wrong, but quick to redeem themselves with $5 \"Zipps bucks. \" the wings were tasty with plenty of meat on them. The service was friendly. Probably wouldn't come back just because there's better places for wings and football."}
{"text":"Food is much better at Goldie's,  the pizza is like cheap frozen pizza, burgers are ok, fries not that great...  Overall experience, don't waste your time!   There are plenty of other sportsbars with way better food and service!!!!  For example, O.H.S.O."}
{"text":"Food was okay, drinks were really good! The place was really loud but big enough to move to another side of the bar if it gets to loud."}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorite neighborhood sports bar's. Great place to catch a game and meet with friends or business associates. Love the jalapeño burger. I've been going there for years and the service has always been great. The only negative thing I could say about Zipp's is their onion rings are frequently over cooked and too crispy. If they cook them just right,  they're spectacular."}
{"text":"Second time my family has eaten at this Zipps and service has bed poor both times. This time three (out of 10) of us ate the chicken skewers and all had diarrhea. We will try another Zipps, like the food, but doubt we'll return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best wings I've ever had !! Drove in Cali and was pleasantly surprised ... Can't speak for the rest of the menu but the wings are ridiculous"}
{"text":"Worst service EVER!  We go to this Zipps weekly..not anymore.  On Saturday night we had a big group of people there.  Playing darts and just hanging out.  We had two drinks that were made terribly but the waitress and manager said we had to pay for them!  After that everyone was so rude and not accommodating and all we wanted was new drinks!!  We left and went to Grassroots which was SO much better!  I also called to tell a manager about our experience and he did nothing.  Never go here!"}
{"text":"Made this account just to write this review. An absolute awful experience, we had a party of 7 at the bar area having a couple drinks. When it came to tab out we were told by the manager, who could only look at the ground and not at our faces as he told us, that they do not split the tab even though they let two people tab out early and somehow split their Checks from the rest of ours. He then told us to do the math and write down what we want to go to each card. After seeing we were getting pretty upset our server came over and said this is how it's always been and that it even says it on the menu, but we never got menus or told that they don't spit tabs. Then she also had the nerve to tell us that the manager was making an exception for us. I guess having us split up our own checks for them is making an exception for us. I will never go back to this place especially with such a priss of a manager that doesn't try to make things right or look you in the eye to say that they were wrong."}
{"text":"Wow I was excited as well to see a new place on Mill Ave and a local place with a good reputation around town.      But this location is a service FAILURE.     Instead of hiring great managers and great people, they must have fired eveyone in training with a brain cause the management here is overrated.    They need to be fired and replaced. 

I have given this place 3 official visits for drinks and food and a few times for drinks each time something wasn't quite right.    First the opened the new place understaffed,  unlike most places who open overstaffed and weed out the bad employees.    They decided to open in March, Arizona's busiest month with Spring Training and they open the week of March Madness.     

The bar seats 30 plus people around a huge horseshoe bar plus about 200 general seating, there was only one  bartender working and one covering the well.    They needed 2 more bartenders,  I waited 10 minutes to get greeted and another 5 mintues for a water and beer,  then took 15 minutes for all three guys on my side to order.    The food came in 20-25 minutes a bit long for just wings, but the wings were good as always.   Good to see they brought the same golden sauce from their other locations.  Order the wings if you want to be happy here. 

Next visit - the place was half empty and service at a table sucked we came in at 7pm and wanted to catch an 8pm movie at the new AMC Centerpointe.   Of course we told our waitress and ordered right away , but food took over 30 minutes.    We only ordered chicken fingers and wings.   The breading on the chicken fingers was a bit soggy and heavy.   The beer batter is too much.   

Last visits we had the worst Manager on the planet give us attitude about walking by the bar on the way to the bathroom.   They don't have any signs at sight level saving the area is off limits , they need to add some swinging doors.    His name was Jason, but frankly all the managers I dealt with or spoke with that night had the same attitude that they didn't care much.   They were too busy to care about giving good service.     I will avoid this bar,   hopefully the summer kills them and they close within a few years,  like Uno's before them or Tavern down the street.   I would rather go see the dbags at el Hefe that support bad management.  

This place is to be avoided , try any other place on Mill.   or another location of Zipps in town."}
{"text":"Customer service was HORRIBLE and do not recommend coming here because they won't play audio for games!!!! Absolutely awful experience! Do not go here! Manager looked at like idiots when we asked to have audio on a soccer game and said no because people are here to enjoy a lunch! IT'S A SPORTS BAR!!!! DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL!"}
{"text":"Wings, burgers and beer!! Oh and i almost forgot, The fries are very yummy too. Of course i dont eat this every day, but once a week wont kill you for a while.. Lol. The place is perfect for having a few drinks and having some sin food."}
{"text":"Service kinda sucks and the servers are bitchy."}
{"text":"I have been here many times since they opened. Happy hour is really good, especially the wings. Food has always been consistently good which can be hard to find these days. I would give them 5 stars but service can be a little slow sometimes just because it gets so busy. Highly recommend ."}
{"text":"I honestly have never gotten such great food or service before! I had the mozzarella sticks and the pepper jack foccacia...mind BLOWN!! I have never had this kind of mozzarella sticks before and they are crunchy, cheesy: basically everything you want in a mozzeralla stick and more! The pepper jack foccacia was delicious with such intense flavors. Above all though, my waitress was amazing! She was friendly, on top of my order and was super helpful. If you ever come here ask for Miranda and you will most definitely not be disappointed. She was spunky, vibrant and knew her stuff when it came to the menu. Ultimately, my experience at this Zipps was better than any other, easily!!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!!!  I had some drinks and appetizers, one of them being some wings.  When they brought out the wings they were the wrong flavor. I told the waitress that they were the wrong flavor and she kind of looked at me funny and told me that because they didn't have a toothpick in them they must be the right order and that I must be mistaken. When I told her I was positive they weren't the flavor I ordered she begrudgingly said she would go put in the order for the correct wings and she left the wrong wings on the table. Since it had been a while since we ordered and we were hungry and they left the wings on the table everyone at the table had another wing.  A couple minutes after the waitress left the assistant general manager came over and asked what was wrong with the wings. We told him they were the wrong flavor and he asked if we wanted a side of the correct flavor. We told him all we wanted were the wings we ordered. He said that he could do that but he would have to charge us for the wings with the incorrect sauce because we already ate some of them. We explained the situation and he told us that their policy was to have all managers come talk to customers when orders are incorrect, which was never explained to us.  The waitress didn't even tell us about the manager and had only said that she was going to ring in new wings. After a few minutes of arguing with the manager we asked for our bill (which they charged us for the wrong wings) and we left. The manager was condescending the entire time and even yelled stuff at us as we left. I used to love Zipps but I am never going back."}
{"text":"Andrew is the worst restaurant / GM I have ever seen.

If I could give them no stars I would. I wouldn't go into too much about our server. She took 20 minutes to greet us for drinks. So we gave her our whole order at that time. Took 10 more minutes for drinks to hit the table. This was at 730. After we sat there for 30 minutes to get drinks. So we never saw her again. I got up went to the server station and refilled all 8 drinks at our table. Mind you there was a total of 12 tables in the whole place. This is where is gets good. At 825 after not seeing our server or the manager. We decided to leave. On the way out the host asked us if everything was okay. She was the only one int he building that even seemed to care. We told her and asked to speak to the manager. She goes and grabs a guy that was sitting at the bar eating and talking with the 4 bar guest. When he comes up we start telling him what was going on. He stops us and says what the F did I do to you. I said are you kidding me I have managed restaurants for 20 years and have never seen a manager act like this. I said you did nothing that is the point you have been sitting there eating since we walked in. He then told me to F off three times and stormed away. I asked if the GM was here to the host. See said that is Andrew our GM. I was taken back for a minute that he was the GM. So we wanted to pay our drink tab and the server was still no where to be found.  I see Andrew in the kitchen yelling and looking at us. So I walked his way he stormed out of the kitchen and said what the F do you want now. Another table said hey there is kids here. He told them to stay out of it. Then he said leave me the F alone I did nothing to you. I said your right just want to pay our drink tab. At this point you would think a GM would pay take care of the N/A drinks on the table. No instead he said here is your Fing tab. Then stormed away again. I have never and I mean never have seen a Manager let alone a GM act like this to guest. Like I said I run a restaurant and would never in my life act like this. Zipps your sales in this location can't be great. Live down the road from this location and normally swing in for a beer or two on my way home. I will never step foot in that Zipps or any other from this point moving forward. I will also being letting my staff of 150 know not to go there either. 
Andrew seems to be the real problem there. Feel free to contact me. I would love to talk to someone about this. The way Andrew acted is not okay for any body let alone a leader.He is not a leader more of a bully. Likely I am not afraid of bullies. Look forward to hearing from someone."}
{"text":"Place is amazing!  Even when busy I still get goo service!  Jus wish they had BBQ wings. HINT HINT ZIPPS!!"}
{"text":"Really good food. The chicken rolls were great and so was the fried chicken salad! The beers are good. I don't know what else to say but Yelp is making me write more for my review. Look you know what kind of restaurant this going to be. It's not a freaking 5 star amazing resultant. It's a sports bar restaurant. It's good. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour. Fries could be better but the burgers were good. Food isn't gourmet but it's cheap and it's a bar. Above my expectations"}
{"text":"Came in and sat outside.  Only ones on the patio surprisingly since the weather is amazing! Had chicken fingers and turkey burger,  AMAZING! Service was great even tho we were the only ones on the patio. Amber our server was top notch!! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We go here fairly often: service is good, wings are excellent. Hard to get in on a friday night and it's loud. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5: lack of quality control. They don't seem super consistent on some of their food, like their focaccia. Sometimes it's hard, sometimes stale and other times it's perfect."}
{"text":"Don't really know how you mess up alcohol and fried food but they did. Cloudy long islands that were 90% sour mix, onion rings (that have obviously been sitting around) came out 45 seconds after they were ordered."}
{"text":"CONS:
1.  Food was passable.
2.  Mediocre selection of anything other than domestic macrobrew.
3.  Service needs SERIOUS help.   The three times i went, the waitresses and front door staff had the charisma of a dejected Hot Topic cashier.  Hey, I'm here to drink beer and run up my cholesterol, let's be happy, ok?


PROS:
1.  When there are better draft beer choices, they certainly have the size advantage.
2.  The seem to handle large crowds fairly ok.
3.  Lots of promise when they tighten up their menu and improve the beer selection."}
{"text":"Great wings and I love how late they're open all week long. Sometimes after 10 the music can be ear-bleedingly too loud, but that's not too often. A good pic for late night food and a place to hang out on weekday nights."}
{"text":"This place is great! I love the service! They are always very friendly and fun! Our favorite bartenders are Jess and Ryan. Jess is really on top of everything. She knows all the regulars by name and she knows their drink of choice. The food is great and priced well too! I definitely recommend the pepper jack focaccia! The skewers are great too!!!  It's always a fun place to hang out and unwind! Thanks Zipps!"}
{"text":"Terrible! Stopped here with a coworker for our lunch hour and when we walked in there was a sign that said to \"please seat yourself\", so we did. All the \"free\" tables were dirty with dishes and food still on them, so we had to stand by one while a server cleaned it off before running away. We then sat and waited... for 15 minutes. During this time no one came by and offered us water or a menu. My coworker got up 3 times and asked different servers each time if we could get a menu. 15 minutes into sitting and no one had actually come to our table to even drop off a menu. We saw multiple servers on their phone's standing by the bar texting instead of actually doing their job. We ended up walking out and going to Perk Eatery in the same parking lot where we got seated and served right away and were still able to make it back to work before our lunch hour was over. Skip Zipps and go somewhere else. ANY where else."}
{"text":"Just waited over hour for bar food.  Manager lied about time and lame excuse about no chefs. We are coming back"}
{"text":"I was dragged, kicking and screaming back into this place

it was yet another low point in my overall experience with Zipps.

the chicken wings came out basically uncooked.. how do you not cook chicken wings 100%? when the bartender asked.... we clearly said they are undercooked and WE WILL NOT EAT THEM.. she ignored them for like 20 minutes and finally slid them into the garbage can.. all while we finished our cheap over-sized beer.. did not even offer to make it right - just threw them out... and I laughed to myself.. served in a basket.. yup they don't even bring you a plate here at ZIPPS. you eat in a plastic basket.. just like 4th grade or prison.. depending on your perspective in life.

if someone offers to take you to a zipps location; turn to that person and tell them, wherever they want to go - It is on you; but don't go to a zipps!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch sports, happy hour specials are great on most days. Food is average to good when compared to other sports bars. Would have been a 4 star review but service was just slow after initial drinks were served. After we finished eating we ended up waiting for approximately 30 min for our server to come back and then finally we just asked another sever to get our check."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever received. Over an hour to get chips and salsa. Waitress never checked on us at all. Will never be back"}
{"text":"Over this place. OVER. I've had too many ups and downs but today was the straw that broke the camel's back. We came in and there was a wait. We waited for about 15 minutes and noticed that there were 4 single guys each taking up a booth- by themselves- in the bar. It was almost comical watching them nurse their beers and play on their phones. While we were waiting on a table so we could get our hangover grub on, we noticed that there were two empty tables (4 tops). Not sure how long they'd been sitting empty, but that was frustrating. 

I guess the manager noticed and came over and asked if we'd mind sitting with some other people at those tables. I, being hungover and not wanting to be judged whilst I shoveled unhealthy greasy wings and a burger in my gullet, said no. I explained that we were just there to eat and would not be camping out to watch Sunday football. Why couldn't we have one of the two empty 4 tops? He wouldn't budge and said that's the way they were seating people. I call bullshit. The last time we were in on a busy Saturday, we sat by ourselves at a booth, ate, and left. No fuss. I didn't even complain when my sweet jalapeno burger came out and was missing the freaking jalapeno sauce. I was too hungry and just ate it and said nothing. 

Well, I am tired of making excuses for Zipps. Their fries are often flacid. The service is hit and miss. The beer selection sucks. Now they won't even fill their own tables? What the heck?Am I decked out in NFL gear like I'm going to pretend your restaurant is my living room? No, I just wanted to eat. But I had to take my money elsewhere to do that. We weren't the only ones who chose to leave either, I watched 3 other couples go while we were waiting. I'm still pissed we weren't told up front that's the way they were going to do the seating. Instead, we had to stand around and wait. At least those single guys at the 4 booths by the bar provided comic relief."}
{"text":"Coldest beer around, and great burgers. Everything on the menu is good, staff is always attentive. I love to get the thousand island burger with fresh chopped jalepenos. Pool tables and shuffle board always make for a good time, whenever there's not a game on one of the many giant tvs."}
{"text":"Went to zipps saturday, food was ok, the service was horrible, server disappeared, v ould not locate her to get refills, bill etc, oh did come by the table once to see if everything was good, did not even get a chance to take a bite!!!!"}
{"text":"In this Zipps the other night and there was a huge RAT behind the bar!! The bartender hightailed it out of there ppl were taking pictures and everything. The manager just casually came with a bucket and used a menu to trap him and carried it out. It was completely disgusting."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of being waited on by Hannah, (the blonde waitress.) She was extremely attentive, had a wonderful personality, and showed amazing leadership skills while training a new employee. Thank you Hannah, and Zipps sports grill! That girl deserves a raise!"}
{"text":"Nice environment, lots of tv's and super friendly staff.  Food needed seasoning but overall ok"}
{"text":"I am a hugeeeee fan of Zipps!! Their golden medium wings are so saucy and full of flavor and the perfect amount of spice. Their ranch,I could drink. It is delicious!! Their fries are the best in town however their onion rings are hit or miss. We went a couple days ago and had the best onion rings out of the 50+ times we have been there. Fully breaded and actually had a crisp to them. Other times they are soggy with undercooked batter or have no breading and  are burnt lil onion rings. But I can never go there and not get fries and onion rings! Now don't get me started on their \"Zipparitas\"...best margaritas everrrr!! Must have if u go to Zipps!! Service is pretty good. Takes a while to get your bar drinks sometimes but they are attentive for the most part. Zipps is a great place for happy hour and reverse happy. I think one of the top 3 in phx for sure. I would like to see them put cool toys in the dinosaur game. My kid was excited to win a spongebob squarepants (plastic) ball. When she opened it, inside was a lil mini plastic body of Mr. Krabs. He didn't even have a head. It had a lil plastic Lego connect kind of ball where his head should be...I guess maybe his head is in another ball in the pit. Lol $1 for that? My kid looked at me like what am I supposed to do with this. *smh put some cool things in that dinosaur game for the kids to grab. ;) we will continue to be regulars tho!"}
{"text":"I woul normally rate the experience here good yet what food establishment runs out of glasses to serve drinks. In addition the wait time for food was unacceptable. I did get my drink in a paper cup."}
{"text":"If your looking for a 5 star restaurant that requires you to have your panties in a wad upon arrival ...this isn't for you. However if you are looking to be a very bad Kitty and get your hands on some wings,  burgers,  beer, and catch a game?? look no further. Just plant your ass right infront of any one of their huge TVs.  They are close enough to leave you crosseyed. The burgers are good, wings awesome and beer?? 32 oz draft 4 bucks on happy hour. I believe that's one step below a personal intravenous draft. Love it! Great happy hour specials, busy crowd and great service.  This was only my second time but I was pretty impressed...although they had me sold at happy hour so check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Ordered wings & burgers, food came all at once. Had to ask for blue cheese dressing for wings,  which was ranch with blue cheese sprinkled over top AND we were surcharge for it. -we didn't even touch the original ranch. PS: Don't sit outside, wood benches are wet and sticky from misters. Go to another sports bar!"}
{"text":"If I could no stars I would. We Wanted to try out the new local Zipps but were sadly disappointed. We were seated quickly and just sat there for 16 minutes without a single server to even take stop by with a simple \"I'll be right with you\". The table next to us had been could tell of our frustration and the gentlemen said they ordered burgers 45 minutes ago and still hadn't received them.."}
{"text":"Have come here several times. Perfect place to come with ur friend. The food is good and service is fast. Really happy with this one. Gonna come again when i have free time"}
{"text":"It was crazy busy but or server was cool and attentive.

Magic Hat on draft for three bucks but 4/5 cause a server crop dusted us."}
{"text":"Rude! Rude! Rude! I will never patronize any of your locations after my last two visits. First Friday September 4th I walked in and hostess said she had tables available but only for parties of 4 or larger. So my party of two went to another neighborhood restaurant which welcomed our business. On Saturday night September 5th we walked in and the hostess says, \"What do you want?'\" We said we'd like a table. Hostess says, \"Yeah I bet!\", in a rude condescending tone. I asked her what she said and she repeated herself. I ask for the manager and he told me he didn't think there was anything wrong with what she said. Fine, Zipps I'll be sure never to visit any of your locations, since you obviously don't want or need my business!"}
{"text":"If you want a greasy hamburger, in a bar, Zipps does that.  They are reasonably priced and I'm a sucker for onion rings.."}
{"text":"We frequent Zipps in Scottsdale and Tempe which is usual good, but this Zipps needs some help. The service was slow and not helpful. We had asked to plug in a charge for our phone in an unused outlet, but they refused to allow us to do so and the managers were not helpful. They had random shows on the TV's, like \"Law and Order\", when a local sports team was currently playing a game. The food was still what we expected so that was nice."}
{"text":"Zipps has and awesome happy hour special. You have to try the zipparitas for only 3 bucks a piece. They limit 3 per person but that's plenty for one person. The wings are tasty, meaty and cheap! Outdoor seating is nice even in cooler weather. There's a big fireplace to huddle around along with heat lamps in the ceiling. Our waitress was a sweetheart!"}
{"text":"This is a cool sports bar & grill that my cousin took me to while visiting Chandler.  They have lots of TVs and yes, the atmosphere is a little loud so its difficult to hear more than one or two conversations at a time but the food and drinks are amazing.  I ordered the chicken fingers with a half & half of sweet potato chips and onion rings.  Their fries aren't as great as the sweet potato chips and onion rings.  Their onion rings aren't heavily breaded and fried so it has a thin ring which makes it pretty tasty.  Their taco salad looked amazing and had a good spicy sauce to go with it.  Their burgers are HUGE !! The meat is pretty thick (at least 1/4 pound) so splitting a burger with a friend isn't a bad idea. I don't drink pop very often so I opted out for a lemonade with some grenadine at the bottom.  It was DELICIOUS !!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous.  We have been here twice for birthday celebrations, on a Friday and a Saturday. About a month apart. Both times, out servers could not keep our tabs straight and made it seem like an inconvenience that such a large group of people, who are genuinely good tippers, had embarked upon their establishment. The bar tender last night was extremely rude to my father in law and we won't being going back to this place. If you want to get together with friends for drinks, this is not not the place to go. I suggest CK's in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"When I lived in AZ, this was my favorite watering hole. I would go after kickball or softball games and it's rare in this part of Scottsdale to have such a bar. Kayla is the best waitress EVER. Always made sure my group was taken care of and never failed to remember my order (so yeah, i was a regular). I have never had bad service from her.
The food at this location is really so-so. I have also been many times to the one on Camelback which amazingly has better food. My faves are the pepperjack focaccia and their burgers are good. Their fries are really hit or miss though. Sometimes they are decent but other times they are just soaked in grease.

Go for the big beers and go early if you want to catch a sporting event."}
{"text":"I understand this is a sports bar but the serving staff needs to learn more about cocktails and the ingredients in basic cocktails."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to chix focaccia's.... 
With extra garlic mayo on the side please.
My side is a salad with blue cheese dressing - no onions - I get this every time I go.

So last night after working on taxes all day I needed a bit of a break and some fun - so of course I chose Zipps and it def was fun.
I worked at their sister co many moons ago - and I love their focaccias - they make me happy. If you haven't tried one I suggest it. 

Overall I like the fun ambiance and layout of this restaurant. It is kid friendly which is important to me as I am dining with kids 99% of the time. Or you can leave the kids at home as they have a bar, pool tables, many TV's with sports games, video games, and a patio. 

My focaccia came out great with bite size pieces of chicken and just the right amount of honey garlic mayo on it. That mayo is one of the reasons I love it so much. My daughters did not come out as great unfortunately. Her pieces of chicken were really small like they were the ends of the chicken and she said it tasted fatty. I split mine with her which she ate with no complaint. My suggestion to the kitchen would be to consistently trim the chicken every time. The salads were good, tasted fresh and had a good amount of dressing on them. We ordered their cookie skillet for dessert. Chocolate chip cookie in a warm skillet with vanilla ice cream on top which is big enough to feed 3 or 4 people. I def recommend this dessert.

The reason I still gave a 5 star review is that the service was super and I'm not one to slaughter a place over one error if everything else goes ok.

My kids left with 4 - yes 4 items from that usually rip off claw stuffed animal machine!
Beat our record of 2 - wow what a night! Met some really cute kids who helped us win the  following items:
A Star Wars lunch box 
A monkey - blue & pink 
A pull-string bag - Star Wars

Now for the best part - we got what looked like a Larry Fitzgerald stuffie. My son was so intent on getting this stuffy and after several attempts and several dollars spent he got it. We learned it was in fact Griffin III not Fitzgerald but I still went home with a very happy little boy :)

Bottom line: it was worth the trip to Zipps

{"text":"I've been going to this place for a long time and even was a busser there during high school. From a customers point of view, it's fallen off a little bit. Still has a great sports bar atmosphere, but the food and even the service is really hit or miss. Better than other locations though."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Zipps for awhile now, however I was EXTREMELY dissatisfied with my last experience at this location. There was an error in both meals ordered, and one was not fully cooked!! After sending the meal back and receiving a new one that was supposed to be cooked, it still was not cooked. Because of the mix up they offered us coupons however would not allow them to be used even after explaining receiving a second dish of uncooked food. (That was not credited nor replaced) Which understandably they would like return business, but serving uncooked food twice is completely unacceptable and has deterred me from dining at Zipps again."}
{"text":"Good location and a popular local hangout for greasy food, cheap drinks, and nightly specials. Can easily drink all night for under $20. Foccacia bread sandwiches are their bread and butter. Not very crazy about their wings."}
{"text":"Went in after the dbacks game for some late night food and drinks... It was dead. And for it being that dead the service was horrible! Had to ask twice for water. Then ask for water refills. Our server Tiffany never asked if we wanted another round or anything. I also found a long blonde hair in my food. They took it off the bill but she was very rude about it and no manager stopped by to see how everything was nor deal with the issue. Will no longer come to this location... Will go out of my way to the Mcclintock and ray location where I get good service!"}
{"text":"Kayla was our server and she was amazing! She had a huge amount of tables, but made each feel special. 

Unfortunately this trip was not as good. We waited 10 minutes to be greeted by a server asking us if we needed drinks. At that point we needed our whole order. Once or order was taken we did not see our server the rest of the night. My drink was empty for 12 minutes when our food showed up. The other server that brought us the food offered something else to drink, but could not have another at that point. My sons order came out incorrect and that was another 9 minutes. Sometimes we have great service here sometimes not. Very hit and miss, poor management as they passed our table 7 times and never checked in."}
{"text":"We were excited to try out the new sports bar in the area and here is what we found.  We were charged for asking for Ranch instead of Ketchup for our fries, you are charged to split a meal, and the waitress seemed less than thrilled to be waiting on us and pretty inflexible.  Food was okay, but certainly not good enough to be \"nickel and dimed\".  I'll try again hoping that my first experience was just bad timing, but our first impression leads us to conclude there are certainly better sports bars in the area."}
{"text":"Very simple, the food wasn't very good. I had the BBQ Bacon Burger - if there is a BBQ Burger on any menu I have to get it - its a personal gluttonous rule for myself. 

The meat here wasn't very good at all but to top that, the BBQ sauce wasn't very flavorful at all either. The only good part was the onion rings, but everything seemed to be sitting in grease just a little bit too long like the grills and deep fryers need to be cleaned or something."}
{"text":"this should an absolute ZERO star review

foods is never prepared the same  - no consistent prep

food is given to you in a basket.. food you will consume.. food you need to live.. a basket.. are you at a A&W fast food place here? or are you paying for food for your body to survive and live? you decide.  who cares about the price? are you some slob that will attack anything in a basket with a beer in front of you (beer is never served cold here.. lukewarm is the best description.. one of the freezers for beer mugs has not been repaired in years...

further, if you sit on the side of the bar furthest away from the door, near the kitchen.. fully expect bugs to crawl up out the coolers onto the bar, at some point of the evening.

staff.. does not want to engage you in any way, shape or form... they want their 20% and they will not talk to you.. this is corporate after all..

btw,,,,, if you drink too much and get a buzz.... don't worry, several of my friends have confirmed that they will call Scottsdale PD on you and report your license plate to the cops to have you arrested for DUI.. (I will give you names if you send me a message)... can't make this stuff up... customer unfriendly as it gets


oh, the patio... yes, your dogs must be kept OUTSIDE the fence. like peasants! not dog friendly here!!

bar, dare you sit at the bar...... unwelcoming and tip 20% or they will do bad things to you... they act like you are not worthy of being served by the great staff... LOL... staff with no experience of actual customer experience.

burgers - grease and never prepared the same
FRIES.. omg.. the fries are kept for hours in a steel bowl in the kitchen and if you are LUckY they might be frest... otherwise LIMP, GREASY and cold
Wings... bad chicken with too much WETNESS is how they actually sell it... they think if you just taste the sauce.. you will never notice how poorly it is prepared for you!!


needless to say, I will never walk in those doors again.

If they call you a regular... you might want to re-consider your role in life..... good luck going here and sooner or later being confronted by SPD!!"}
{"text":"I come here every week for some beers and chicken wings with the guys from work.  I'm addicted to the chicken wings cuz they're so good.  Just a tip, try the golden medium wings \"extra crispy\" with a side of buffalo sauce.  I get the buffalo hot and this way you can kinda control the heat level.  The wings will have just the right amount of crunch and still be tender inside.  I find myself thinking about their wings sometimes and especially if I miss a week.  Ask for Holly cuz she knows how to have the kitchen make your wings just perfect!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan from way back when I lived over in Scottsdale, now I get my Zipps and the nice 16th street vibe... Win/win. Going to this or any Zipps is basically a checklist of what you want in a sports bar. Games? Check. Flat screen TVs every direction you turn? Check. Friendly Staff? Check. Great wings? Check. But there are a couple of things that Zipps does better than most other places:

-Great specials every night of the week
-Awesome fries... Awesome.
-Oh, and they serve giant beers in mugs the size of your head. 

I'm really happy Zipps joined the neighborhood. There is now a pretty good pub crawl to be had without leaving corners of 16th and Bethany Home."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot when I am in the mood for sports bar food and atmosphere. A Blue Moon on tap with an orange slice, to go with some of the golden wings is the perfect combination for me. Zipps is one of my top spots in the valley when it comes to wings. If you are looking at something more for dinner the rest of the menu doesn't disappoint. The salads and burgers are great, but if you are looking for that one thing on the menu you have to try, its the Monaco foccacia. When I go to this place with 8 friends, 7 are getting the Monaco. As good as everything else on the menu is, I rarely venture away from the Monaco. The happy hour here is nothing mind blowing, but def worth checking out, $5 for a dozen wings and a few bucks for a 32oz domestic beer make it a budget friendly dinner before 7.

The food here is 5 stars for me. My one qualm with this place is they will charge you for every extra thing you order. We ask for an extra side of ranch and some celery..$3 dollars. And if you plan on splitting something, expect to pay extra. I worked at a restaurant under the same owners and they take off 7 dollars from every employees paycheck as a drink charge whether you drink from the soda fountain or not. point is these owners will nickel and dime you for every cent they can get.  

Overall if you want a great sports bar to eat at, or a place to catch a game, this is the place you want to go."}
{"text":"My favorite food is cheeseburgers and the burgers here are the absolute best....BAR NONE! Service is always great and on top of it. The burgers are a great price and the zipparitas are delicious. I come here regularly for there tasty burgers....oh and did i mention that the fries are also phenomenal!!! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Bad slow service, if I went into details about examples why I\"d be writing a novel. But I won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, good service, and the food is better than any sports bar in town. They have amazing salads for those who are health conscience. I love this place!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.... but Not my last the food was good and the waitress Jackie and Marissa were wonderful. I WILL MOS DEF BE BACK."}
{"text":"Go here for drinks but skip the food unless you are either starving or wasted.

The food is really just nothing worth writing home about. During happy hour you can get a slice of pizza for $1.50, which is a good deal. I personally opted for the fish tacos. Damn near broke my tooth on the batter, while all along in search for the fish. Never really found it to be honest. We also ordered the BBQ ranch salad, which was yummy. Then again, it is really difficult to mess up a salad that has both ranch and BBQ sauce...will not do a back flip for it.

The drink specials were great. 32oz domestic drafts for $3.50. $3 for a pint. 

So...order 3 32oz drafts and pound them. You should then have a pretty good buzz going. Then the food should taste divine."}
{"text":"The food was good, the server and employees rude. It seems as if they would rather be somewhere else. The server got our drink order wrong and when we told her she said that's what we ordered, we were a party of five,
 we heard what we ordered. It seemed like an unfriendly atmosphere. We are new to the neighborhood and when we told our neighbors about our experience they said that's the reason for them not going there anymore."}
{"text":"9 pm on a Sunday does not go well here!! We ordered 2 waters and when they arrived both had brown sticky spots all over them! Gross! Secondly we order sandwich and french fries. Nope that didn't work out either! Cold fries!!! Also just all around not clean from the tables and chairs to the place where you wash your hands! This place needs some desperate attention!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst places I've been in a long time. The service and food are horrible. Bad service I can tolerate as long as the food is great. But when it comes to food... This day and age you need to be on top of your game.  The \"focaccia \" bread was... Weird and completely tasteless. The Chicado chicken burger was also way under seasoned. The fries and onion rings were so greasy I couldn't even palate them. I normally can eat anything and everything... But these items made me sick. The reason I even have one star is because the golden wings truly are delicious.  But it wasn't enough. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Please do yourself a favor and do not eat here. After telling my server I was allergic to dairy and being assured there was none in the veggie burger I ate it.  However, a few bites in I googled the ingredients and found that Gardenburger lists mozzarella cheese as an ingredient on their website. A manager proceeded to come over and tell me the box did not say it had dairy in it. Unfortunately for me, even managers at this establishment do not know what is in their food and as a result I ate something I was allergic to and STILL have a rash to show for it."}
{"text":"Ordered skwers in glendale..left after 30 min and no food.  Management chased us out for $ when food never reached table!!!  Wtf. Threw $20 for no food. Thanks for nothing. Bartender seemed \"distracted\""}
{"text":"A disastrous experience with food yesterday evening at Zipps Chandler location. The order of Nachos and the fries/onion rings was burnt to the point it was not edible. Both items sadly do not require any culinary skills and a mere acknowledgement would have been better. 

When that was pointed out to the manager there was no recourse available other than an offer for a complimentary dessert. Fast food joints will do a better job with customer service than this horrible excuse of a neighborhood bar and sports grill. 

Want to add that the service by the server and hostess was satisfactory."}
{"text":"This place gets PACKED....,my first time coming here, it was A LONG WAIT to get a table but it was the start of the bball finals. The drink prices were reasonable, I ended up having to order to go, the food was ok. Im sure it would've been much better if I could've eaten there and not had to drive 15 minutes with my dinner."}
{"text":"This place use to be a favorite but I will not be going back. Not only did they bring out the wrong food, they also charged me for it and gave me a $5 gift certificate. Service took forever. I use to come here after my soft ball games but I will have to find a new spot."}
{"text":"In really enjoying my meal at zipp's today. We came here, famished and unwilling to wait 20 minutes to be seated at over easy. What a pleasant surprise! I ordered the tenderloin focaccia. When I ordered the focaccia, I anticipated neat atop a thick piece of bread. However, a thin pita like bread wrap came. Luckily, it was extremely tasty and satisfying. The French fries are tasty and seem homemade. The only thing I recommend is not ordering the onion rings, which are soggy."}
{"text":"I've been to different zipps locations on a number of occasions and have never been dissatisfied. Today in particular I had a great experience as I received great service in addition to a phenomenal Cardinals game! Although I could tell the staff was busy, my server Megan was very attentive, polite, and informative. She managed to keep a smile on her face through the chaos (which I expect is not unusual for the location) and was sure to not only keep our orders accurate, but also separate. It's nice to know I've found a place to congregate for game day. Go Cards!"}
{"text":"My husband and I would go to this location at least once a week. Never had a problem until tonight. We both ordered the Zipps dog. They came cold. Not even warm, just cold like they took it out of the package and put it in a bun. We told our server and he took the hot dogs and brought us 2 more. Guess what,  they were cold too. Watched as our server yelled at the kitchen staff. They didn't charge us for the cold hot dogs but really, they can't cook a hot dog! Will not be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to go to watch a game in Tempe. I went around looking for a place to watch the college football finals and finally settled on Zipps. They have a huge TV where they connected 9 40+ inch TVs into a gigantic screen at the bar. The bartenders were friendly despite the crowds. I like that they serve pints there. Food took a long time to arrive but it was worth it. I ordered the Zipps golden chicken, and it was amazing! I think I ordered it spicy because it was really spicy (bartender warned me), but it was still great! 

Would go there again with friends just to chill and watch a game."}
{"text":"This place is RIGHT next to my gym, which is both good and bad for me.  And my waist.

So, it's a sports grill.  Don't expect fancy, don't expect life changing.  It is what it is, and it's GOOD at what it is.  

The food is not phenomenal, but it's decent.  It's just right for a sports grill.  My personal favs are the chicken skewers, the crispy chicken salad (I have a thing for crispy chicken), and the plain ol' chips and salsa with guacamole. Nom nom!

Now, if you are a fan of imbibing (and, I mean, who wouldn't be if you're choosing to go to a sports grill), this place is pretty hard to beat for the happy hour and nightly specials they have.  Seriously, huge beers for 3 bucks a piece, super strong margaritas for 3.50, and vodka drinks for 3 or 4 bucks?!  C'mon!  That's pure gold!  

It's a great place to hangout with friends and get quite toasty (if you're into that sort of thing).  Nice service, nice food, a few games, good drinks and CHEAP specials every day.  You should go.  You'll have fun."}
{"text":"I usually go there to watch NFL game on Thu. Almost same table every time. Servers are friendly and they know your order in advance. Food is OK, just bar food. One thing, onions rings seem to be too much greasy and flavorless. Compared to other Zipps in the valley, this is the best I've seen so far."}
{"text":"I've been here a few time due to proximity, but Zipps isn't worth going out of your way for.

The first time we were there we tried the Green Chili burger, which had an unusual artificial flavor to it (possibly the cheese) and came with soggy fries.

The second time I tried their chicken tacos which seemed to be a delivery method for sour cream more than anything else.

It's the kind of food that you probably need to be four or five beers in to appreciate, but if you're just there to watch a game and eat there are better options around.

Service is friendly and reasonably quick, they're just not offering a great product from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Great food........ H O R R I B L E service. My fiancé and a good friend of ours went for our first time the other day and I was amazed at how inconsiderate and rude our waitress was. First, we walk in and seat ourselves and wait 15 minutes till anyone greets us, then, without even welcoming us the first thing she says is \"you know you can't be I here unless you are 21 right? Give me your ID\". I understand checking IDs is important, I have been a waitress before, but I mean demanding and being completely rude without even saying hello is completely unnecessary! Common courtesy is to greet and welcome your customers.....how hard can that possibly be? When we ordered our food she had nothing but attitude when we asked questions about the menu, or if she didn't hear/understand a question she would snap back with a \"WHAT?!\" This girl ruined our experience or interest of ever returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Poor service, and food not as good as other locations. Iced tea even watered down.
I gave it too many stars on check in as  thought it would be on par with other locations I have been to."}
{"text":"I love zips. It's my go to sports bar and it's fantastic. With that said, this location is terrible!!! Food is always cold, services is slow, and it's a horrible experience. Go to zips, just not this one!



I've been here a couple more times since this review. They have really worked on services and I can't complain, this is a top notch place. Keep it up. Kayla is fantastic too, if she's your waitress, you are set!"}
{"text":"Usually love this place to watch the game! But the nachos we ordered were SO SOGGY we couldn't even eat them. The waitress gave us a free beer to make up for it but that didn't even cover half the cost of the nachos. Would have rather had it taken off the bill. Won't be back again for food!"}
{"text":"TVs are the only reason to be here. Couldn't order all drums for wings even after offering to pay a little more. Salad came out with everything else. \"Oh, you wanted it first?\"  Yep, I did-like everyone in America. BBQ chicken sandwich was flat dry piece of chicken drowned in BBQ sauce. Move along and find another place to send your time and money."}
{"text":"Terrible Service and mediocre food. Not worth it unless you just want to drink and watch games."}
{"text":"Hey Zipps...Did you change out the fish in your fish sandwich?  The menu says \"icelandic cod\"  it was remarkably like Tilapia tonight and a big disappointment.  Please go back to cod or change your fish supplier.  BTW, your wings are the best."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad. The waitress brought the wrong drink, when told about it she said that's what we ordered. 5 people heard what the order was. Not a friendly staff. This was the second time I've been there, we'll never go back."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great burgers, pizza and sandwiches. Some of the best onion rings I have ever had and I love onion rings.
Great beer selection too.
Sometimes it can get a little loud but hey, its a sports bar.
Great staff and service too.
I try to go there at least once a week."}
{"text":"This is a great place to watch a Sunday Night Football game. There's enough TVs it doesn't matter where you sit or which way you look, you can always see whats going on.
The medium Buffalo wings have great flavor. Probably some of the better wings I have eaten and I eat a lot of wings.
The Mozzarella cheese sticks are different than any I have ever had. They too were great. 
The service was great.  The prices were cheaper than I expected. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"A little disappointed when we sat at a booth several tables away from the bar and were told to move to the other side as our 19 yr old son was not welcome near the bar. I get it, just a little rude in my opinion"}
{"text":"I went to watch MSU today.  Awesome.  The manager was great.  He turned on the game even though AS U was on.  The bartender Amber great.  We are from out of town.  Great food great COLD beer.  Thanks awesome."}
{"text":"I was visiting Scottsdale this past weekend and checked out a lot of different restaurants.  Zipps was on the list for Saturday night at about 7:00.  I was with about 10 friends and we went to grab a quick bite to eat and watch a little football.  We got a seat outside without a wait.  Our server, Emily, was very personable and out going.  Almost all of us ordered a Focaccia because we had never tried one before.  Everyone tried a different Focaccia and everyone loved what they got.  Over all, the services was great, the food was delish, and the atmosphere was fun. What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Went in to watch the World Cup and asked if they would turn the audio on instead of the 80's music they had blaring (it was 3:30pm).  They said no because it was Happy Hour.  There were many other people who made the same request.  With no other major games on.... WTH!?  You're a sports bar!?  I don't think so.  We left and went to Titled Kilt - they had the audio plus the scenery was much better."}
{"text":"Good place to watch a game, lots of fun .

10 dollar 18 inch pizza ! We will be back next time we're  in Chandler.
Gary"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever had! If you have any requests the answer will be no! The guy manager could care less about people so don't waste your time. This is not from one single event. I used to be a regular but finally gave up on this place after being dissapointed time after time."}
{"text":"Zipps is awesome

Local chain but each location has a neighborhood vibe. Staff is always very attentive and I have visited locations all over the valley.

Tons of specials and a great place to have a casual night"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the way they changed making their nachos.  Not as good as before.."}
{"text":"After waiting an hour, we left. They seated several groups from the bar ahead of us. When I asked why she said they had been waiting, but their names weren't on the list?  Won't try again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant ever! The food is always amazing, atmosphere is great as well! Service can step it up a little more, but the foods so great that I can't stop going back!"}
{"text":"second time here never had a problem in the past but this time I found a roach in my drink. so disgusting I still can't believe it!!!"}
{"text":"Well one good thing is the wings we're OK but my onion rings were cold and my beer wasn't very cold our service was very bad lots of great TVs and sports on but no sound for Saturday night it was pretty dead they had more stuff than they had people but still had bad service it seems like a really cool atmosphere but with that service I don't think I'll go back"}
{"text":"First time customer, 4/17 around 8pm.  Sat at the bar for drinks & burger -- FANTASTIC service.  Very attentive bar staff and I could see the rest of the busy place was being taken care of.  Only question, why have a hostess if all she does is stand there?  No seating, no greeting or acknowledging customers, just staring off into space for an hour or so.

Food... sorry I wanted to like it, but yeck!  Burgers took a while (wasn't complaining) but the great bartender was on point and watching, hooked us up when it was taking to long (due to being slammed?).  Order finally came, disappointing.  First the bottom of the bun was super hot, as if sitting on the 'hot' shelf for a while.  Burgers overcooked, dry and flavorless.  Sides of fries & rings were soggy and greasy and barely warm.  Edible but nothing to repeat.  If they were that busy in the kitchen, assumed I'd have at least fresh fries.  Didn't try the wings which everyone raves about.   Who knows, if I'm brave in the future I may give another shot."}
{"text":"Food is pretty average, burgers are definitely the way to go. French fries need work & water tastes like recycled toilet water. Good amount of televisions, good place to have a beer & catch a game in the neighborhood. Don't expect much from the food but location for us tukees' ain't bad."}
{"text":"This location has been our go-to since over 4 years now. We used to love the food and the service, which got us hooked to this place. Alas, their food and service has been deteriorating the last few months. Why? New staff, new management! We waited for over 45 minutes for our food to arrive at 7 pm on a Sunday night. The server was new and probably at her first job - clueless about most things, but somewhat polite. The manager was the most rude I've ever come across! We gave you a lot of second chances zipps, but this is it. Goodbye!"}
{"text":"had the nicest server tonight that I have ever had here, she was so polite! ordered the chicken fingers and fries with a side of ranch and once again it did not disappoint! always get the ranch it's so so much better than the regular store bought ranch."}
{"text":"Sub average service and cold food. This has happened to us before so we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Waited more 30 min for food when restaurant slow, food was terrible (like frying oil needed to be replaced), the chicken fingers were disgusting and my hungry kids wouldn't eat it, and the waitress did not care at all. She wasn't rude, just terrible service."}
{"text":"I've been to Zipps twice and both times had an awesome burger. I normally sit outside because the bar can be loud for a date or get together. Drinks are a little weak but tasty."}
{"text":"Zipps is the place I go for good wings. They are not the cheapest but also not the most expensive. However they have consistently good meaty wings. We also get a side salad which is always fresh.  The only complaint is that their ice tea is awful. Always taste old and burnt. Service is par for a sports bar."}
{"text":"I've only been once, and sat at the bar when I went. The service was excellent. Both bar tenders were very attentive, and always checked in a what I consider a perfect frequency. The prices are great and so is the food."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  I enjoy being able to have a beer, and a great bar meal.  I think their focaccia sandwiches are REALLY good!  Too good, in fact.  Just fun to hang out have a beer, and eat food that is bad for you."}
{"text":"Came here once for lunch with friends. We decided to have a beer before we ordered food. When we were ready to order food and another round we were told by the waitress that we were cut off and they wouldn't serve us anymore alcohol because \"there are off duty cops playing pool in the other room\" this was the middle of the day on a weekday and we were all sober before our one beer. Now I drove by this place to meet friends for wings and beer. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Alex, the manager, was SO rude to us last night. His attitude was so hateful, our whole group of 15 got up and walked out, before evening being seated. Not quite how we imagined our friends 21st birthday. What's really awful is that our group of 15 to 20 people gather there three times a month for dinner, which was mentioned. Obviously this guy doesn't care for our business. We won't be back, as this guy seems to enjoy picking fights and arguing with customers.
WORST MANAGEMENT EVER!"}
{"text":"By far THE worst service and not to mention the staff needs improvement. I enjoy Zipps and this location unfortunately is not something I would recommend to anyone. I will for sure stay on my side of town in Scottsdale with the smiles and welcoming of the staff."}
{"text":"I had a disappointing lunch experience at Zips this afternoon.  I ordered the chicken fingers tossed in golden medium wing sauce as I usually do when i visit Zips for lunch.  This visit was not like the others as I was not served a fresh order of chicken fingers,  The chicken they used for my order had been sitting in a warmer or over the fryer for a while.  I had two discussions with the server around the quality of my meal and neither resulted in her apologizing, escalating to a manager or offering to replace my meal.  This rating is a reflection on a lazy kitchen staff serving chicken nuggets vs freshly made chicken fingers and a lack of operating procedures that focus on customer satisfaction.  Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Our go-to neighborhood bar. This Zipp's far outweighs the Camelback location, in  my opinion. Maybe it's the more \"in-tune\" servers or just the overall better quality of food - but we always choose this one to quench our wing and beer cravings! Their medium buffalo wings are the best in the valley that I've personally had and their happy hour drink specials cannot be beat. It's hard to find a really good happy hour  but these guys do it right. If you want a good premium pint, a dozen medium wings and good service overall - Zipps' on Via De Ventura is the spot you should choose!"}
{"text":"I love love love Zipps. It would be somewhat embarrassing to put into text how many times my husband and I have gone over the years. Have never had anything bad to say until this evening.

My dad and I went in for dinner around 6:30pm, ordered drinks and food right away, hoping for a quick meal.  Out appetizers came out fast, but we literally waited over 45 minutes for two turkey burgers.  The manager finally came over at one point saying it would be a few more minutes.  When I told him that we had already been waiting more than 30 minutes, he apologized and said the kitchen was really backed up.  I worked in restaurants all throughout college and totally understand that things like this happen, but this was a Monday evening, on a non-game night and the restaurant was not busy.  

The server was very nice and apologized as she had made a mistake and did not submit the food order. My issue is with how management handled the situation.  The manager came over and provided $10 in Zipps bucks to be used on our next visit, this amount covered only one of the burgers. Our two burgers that we waited 45 minutes for should have been taken care of this evening, no questions asked."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the extra distance to avoid the Zipps on Warner. Great service, better quality food, and a more welcoming experience than the Warner location. Our waitress' name is Paris and she's done an awesome job so far! Mozzarella stick and golden medium wings!"}
{"text":"Getting worse every time we come in here. Service is terrible. Incredibly slow. Every time we come in people are complaining about either not getting their food at all or having to wait way too long for their food to arrive. Don't recommend at all. We'll be done for awhile until new management takes over.  At least we don't have to waste money on tipping anyone..."}
{"text":"I can't say I have ever actually been to Zipps and received service I was even remotely content with.  This trend of poor service seems to apply to all locations of this sports grill and gives me no reason to go back.

I went with a few friends to the Mill location and all of them ordered the same order except for my order which was the only different of the four.  After an excess amount of wait time after ordering (a common occurrence at Zipps) the waitress returned with my three friends meals but not mine.  

After waiting another 10 -15 minutes she finally returned and when I asked where my meal was she was confused and did not have it.  So she took my order again, with attitude, and my meal wasn't brought to me until about 10 minutes after everyone I was with had already finished theirs.

When I saw a manager approaching me with the food I was expecting some type of compensation or at least an apology, however I got almost the exact opposite.  

The manager attempted to swing their mistake into blaming me for not having my food, which does not even make much sense.  

So after poor service, immature management who can not hold themselves accountable for mistakes, and decent (at best) food, I will not be returning to any Zipps location again."}
{"text":"I'm a regular  at this location. I had brought a friend by the tempe location are waitress was Magon. Close to the end of her shift she was rushing the tab to be paid instead of her offering to pay or transfer  the tab . When I had asked for her name she started to had a nasty attitude and asked why I'm asking for her name. 
After asking her four times she told me . I asked her to transfer  my tab in which  she stated she refuses  to do so . I informed  the mgr in which he stated that he would take care of it. This is the second  time I had bad service. I don't recommend  do to pour service."}
{"text":"Zipps is a rocking place with TV screens in all viewable angles. The atmosphere is great and this place really packs it in on game nights like Monday Night Football. Smoking is outside because this place is around the Tempe border. The service is great and the food is even better. Try the chicken tacos!
Good times had by all!
Check it out some time!"}
{"text":"American mediocrity at its greatest.  Zipps is nothing shy of being unremarkable, and yet I have been here to eat, drink, and watch games on too many occasions to count.  

Zipps' food is slightly better than your standard bar food, but it is still average at best.  The burgers are okay, but not nearly as good as the ones you could get at In-N-Out or even at Four Peaks Brewery.   Even when I've opted for food other than a burger, those choices were pretty average too.  

For a sports bar, I feel as though Zipps should have better fries.  It seems pretty intuitive that if they were to improve their fries and onion rings there would be a profound increase in the number of orders for those items.  Spending three hours in a sports bar inevitably leads to drinking many beers.  If there were good, cheap, greasy food (e.g. fries and onion rings) to sop up that alcohol, Zipps would surely experience greater profits.   

F.Y.I. My business skills are available for hire."}
{"text":"Great bang for the buck.  Wife and I had 2 drinks each and split 3 apps and the bill was under $40.  Amber was very friendly and the Bloody Mary was excellent.  I would recommend this place for its food and cold beer and great service."}
{"text":"First few times there I thought the food was decent enough to return but after the past 2 visits I have decided that my money would be better spent elsewhere. Last week I had the nachos which was absolutely horrible. First of all the food at lunch took over 20 minutes to arrive to the table then the nachos showed up as basically dry chips with oversized globs of Guac and Sour Cream and Salsa on top. The ground beef was mainly toward the bottom and was very greasy. The wings we had as an appetizer that also took too long were very good. 
So last night I went there with my wife and got the club sandwich. I get a sandwich away from home because they are supposed to be better but I could have stayed home and made anything better than what I was served. Wilted lettuce was the first turnoff then the dryness of the sandwich had me taking a sip of beer with every small bite. The O-rings were flakey and tasteless unless you really want the taste of the oily breading.
Sorry Zipps but 2 strikes and you are out with me. Service is good and friendly but to pay for the garbage they plate there is ridiculous."}
{"text":"As a rule, I don't bother leaving negative reviews, but this place deserves an exception. We visited Zipps on a weekend night, hoping for some decent late-night food and reasonable service. We got nothing of the sort. 

SERVICE FAIL:
Our server spent most of the time we were there groping all over her boyfriend, who was seated in the booth ahead of us. By the time we were ready to order, most of the other servers had gathered around his booth to gossip and chat with our server. 

At one stage, he actually turned around and looked at us, and asked our server if she shouldn't be concerned about looking like she wasn't working. She laughed and dismissed his question, saying \"Scotty went home a while ago. I can do whatever the f*** I want!\" I can only assume \"Scotty\" is a manager, and he must be so proud of the staff who all cackled at her response. 

After the laughter died down, she took our order and returned to pawing the guy in the booth ahead of us. A different server eventually brought out our food.

FOOD FAIL:
I ordered the club sandwich. What I got was two slices of questionable lunchmeat, two pieces of cold bacon, a tomato slice and some brown-around-the-edges lettuce on barely-toasted white bread. With a toothpick. Just a hint, Scotty, A toothpick does not make it a club sandwich. 

I chose the sweet potato chips as my side, which were horrible as well. Chips should not be soft and greasy. 

My dinner companion ordered the chicken caesar salad. Nothing to see here. Dump some greens into a bowl, pour on caesar dressing, throw on some overcooked, leathery chicken meat and send it on out.

CONCLUSION:
If all you want is a basket of fried appetizers, huge mugs of cold domestic beer and some screens on which to view your favorite teams, this might be the right place for you. If you have any desire at all for quality of food or service, don't waste your money or time."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We brought in a group of 25 and spent over $350. We reviewed our bill and found that there were 2 things on there that we didn't order. The manager refused to take it off. He argued with us and refused to take off the two items that we didn't order. On top of that it took over 45 minutes after food was served to get everything out.  I will not return to this zipps.

I will say the old town and north Scottsdale zipps are wonderful. I'm not sure why this one is so awful."}
{"text":"Our server was amazing. Very friendly, fast and brought stuff to keep our little guy happy, along with a  great personality. The wings were great as always.....HOWEVER,  the Foccaccia was beyond disgusting and the manager is a giant douche bag! The foccaccia bread was 100% raw dough. We asked the waitress if it was supposed to be raw. She said \"no\" and got us the manager.  He creeps over to our table, like a pedophile with no introduction as to who he was. We showed him the raw dough/bread. He tried to tell us they make their bread on the \"doughy\" side. I had to laugh..sorry, but its not bread until its cooked. It was the thickness of an uncooked tortilla. All he says is \"can I get this out of your way?\" (referring to the foccaccia)  and leaves. Wth? No apology, no nothing. It was so ridiculous, it was comical. Who tells a customer they serve bread on the \"doughy side\"... no one does that! Get some customer service skills."}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes for one slice of pizza. It finally came and was burnt. When I pointed it out to the server she said \"I know, it's burnt\", grabbed the basket and walked away. Ummm... if you knew it was burned to a crisp why did you serve it in the first place? 
We finally flagged her down and told her we were leaving and she had the audacity to still charge us for the sandwich we also ordered but didn't eat because we were waiting on the pizza slice. 
The manager did come over and give us two $5 gift certificates. A better idea would have been to comp our one sandwich. I tried to give my gift certificates away to anyone walking in as we were walking out but there were no new customers."}
{"text":"Had lunch today, the burger was great and my server was great! I believe her name was Cookie, she was quick and witty. I'll definitely come back when she's bartending! Keep her around:)"}
{"text":"Not one  to post negative experiences, but thought the treatment my wife and I received today at Zipp's warranted a post. We planned to watch the afternoon games today and arrived in the bar area just as the early games were ending and people occupying booths and tables were settling tabs. As luck would have it no one was leaving and seating in the bar area was scare. We elected to wait for a table to free up and ordered a few drinks from the bar. 

Luck would have it that a couple at a nearby table were leaving and knowing we were the only people in the bar area waiting, suggested we take their table. We took them up on their offer and quickly sat down. Within moments the waitress told us this table was reserved for her friends. Now as I have been told many times at his particular Zipp's, all seating in the bar is open and on a first come first served basis. Things quickly escalated with the waitress still maintaining she had promised the table despite the restaurants policy. Her friends had entered the restaurant after us and in all fairness were next in line after us for a table after we had taken ours. Things worked out in the end when a booth opened up in the same waitress's section and we quickly moved there. Service was fine, but I was still pissed that the waitress tried to skirt their policy for her friends, who in the end spent half of what we did on our tab.

Not sure this particular Zipp's wants to keep customers happy. On another occasion I came in for Monday night football only to find the place jammed. However 3 open seats we're at the bar and when I went to sit down, was told they we're reserved for guys outside smoking. Turns our the future lung cancer patients stayed outside the entire game tying up the seats and causing the bar to lose multiple customers who couldn't get a seat. Zipp's is close and convenient but I think I'll take my business elsewhere based on today's treatment."}
{"text":"Love coming here for the late night happy hour with my fiancé!  I love the drink specials and and she love the jalapeño burgers. The wings of are our favorite too, they are always nice and big! Service is always good too!"}
{"text":"We were excited when we heard Zipps was moving into the S. Chandler location. We've been to their other locations and love their ice cold beer selection, their wings are the absolute best and always consistently prepared, and there are TV's everywhere when we want to watch games (especially ASU because we don't get the Pac 12 games at home w/our cable network). The prices too are super reasonable and the portions generous with one exception (see comments to follow).

Here's why the lower rating... First of all, the volume of the TV's are insanely loud!!!! At first we thought it was an accident or one employee cranking the volume, and now after a ton of visits, we know that's just how it's going to be. Even our teenagers, who've grown up eating at other Zipps, hate the volume so we would never choose to go there because the atmosphere is shot, volume dialed up even on nights when there is not a major game.

Secondly, the food, with the exception of the wings and salads, is just not that good. The focaccias have almost no meat in them and the fries are typically undercooked. The burgers are average, the bacon hard and over-cooked on numerous occasions. 

We eat out 5 plus times a week between lunch and dinner and I really hope this location improves because we'd love to go more."}
{"text":"The jackass general manager turned off Cubs playoff game as he wanted to watch football.  When asked why he said that's what people want and told me tough shit.  Heard other complaints about the same GM.  Plan to contact corporate office as the guy was such a dope."}
{"text":"Zipps as a whole has definitely gone downhill lately.  I visited the N. 100 St. location for the first time with my family on 9/19.  Monday night football.  Big mistake.  The food and service were terrible.  It took 45 minutes to receive our order.  I ordered wings which came out cold and undercooked.  The server never addressed the long wait and poor quality.  In fact, the table next to us ended up cancelling their order because of the poor serve.  It's a shame that the only recourse is to penalize the server for the restaurant's shortcomings.  That's why tipping percentages are discretionary."}
{"text":"Great Food and Great Service!

My favorite place to watch the game, or just hang out!

However, recently there has been some bartending changes, and the new ones are not as good as the old ones....."}
{"text":"Been coming here on and off since it opened and found that it is a sports bar. It is a smaller version of what is in the valley and be kinda cramped. The capacity is def not like the one on Indian School. They have a good section of drinks and beer, it has consistent food and it has speedy service. Alot of regulars for sure and good mix of people can be found on game day, from families with small kids, to 20 somethings. The place can get packed, but have never had to wait. Will continue to come back."}
{"text":"I walked into Zipps by accident.  I walked out a disciple of their burgers.  I thought my mom was cooking in the back without the guilt.  The tomato florentine soup was yummy.  Can't wait to go back to try the wings.  My server Jessica was a dream.  She was friendly, enthusiastic, helpful and a great server."}
{"text":"I have to admit that the first time I went to Zipps I was less than impressed. The wrap I got was ok, nothing to rave about. This was all about a year ago. I decided to give it another shot and boy am I glad I did. 

The golden wings are amazing! 32 oz domestic beers are a great deal even when they are not on special. Zipparitas with flavored add ins... Delicious! Also, sports on every monitor, what have I been missing out on?! 

I'm rating it 4 stars because multiple times we have ended up waiting for our check for quite a long time. Other than that though, I'm completely satisfied. This will be my new spot whenever I'm craving some wings!"}
{"text":"The service here was terrible, the waitress ( Christin ) was rude and the food was flavorless. A friend found an uncooked French fry in her meal. Soup was lukewarm. We were waiting like 1 hour for the food to come out, although there was only two waitresses, they were extremely rude and had a bland personality. Even after some orders were wrong we got no apology. I will not be coming back, and will not be recommending at all."}
{"text":"Terrible service, poor quality food. Gilbert and Warner location is better. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"So I'm in town for spring training and looking for a place to watch the opening Sunday night baseball game. ...and we found ourselves at Zipps. 

For a sports bar, they get big credit for the number of TV's and the variety of sports on. The game on the largest screen was in fact the baseball game. On other tv's you could find the Suns/Lakers game, college baseball, college hockey, and MMA. The Tv's were high enough and placed well so you could watch the game/s you were interested in. 

The place was not crowded but the wait staff seemed overworked. (Or perhaps just slow.) They were pleasant enough. 

The food was hit and miss. I had the BBQ burger and fries. Friend #1 had the same but with sweet potato chips and friend #2 had the chicken sandwich with onion rings. We were happy with the burgers. Cooked well, with bacon and an onion ring. I expected it to be messy and it didn't disappoint. The BBQ sauce was tasty. Fries were average and the chips were tasty. On the other hand the chicken sandwich was bland and friend #2 said, \"these are the worst onion rings I have ever had.\" I have eaten with her many times and consider her an onion ring connoisseur. 

Overall, this was an average experience. If I'm back in the area again, I would be willing to come back but I'm not going out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Only a one star because I can't do zero. Came here with 13 friends for my birthday and my friends. The manager, Adam, promised up a happy hour price for shots at one amount and my tab along with several other friends and was much more than what he said. The new manager on duty said Adam was already gone for the night and they wouldn't adjust my tab. Low and behold, Adam was outside the whole time."}
{"text":"Zipps is usually a great place to eat. I take my son here often. But today I was just a bit angry with my lunch order. I place an order over the phone. It was a simple chicken fingers with a side of onion rings. They said it would be done in 20 minutes. I got there at the 20 minute mark and still had to wait. Once I got back to work with my food, I seen that they had put regular fries instead of onion rings... I couldn't go back to correct the order because my lunch is only a half hour..."}
{"text":"Don't expect anything too out of the ordinary, but Zipps is a pretty decent sports bar tucked away behind a CVS on Ray and McClintock.  Lots of TVs, a mix of grease and healthy on the menu, shuffle board, pool tables and a lot of hot waitresses for the guys.

I have a hard time ordering anything but their chicken fingers because they are extra greasy and so delicious.  But the rest of the menu is decent and I haven't ordered anything bad yet.  They have the Mother of All Brownies on the menu and it is seriously the best dessert I have ever had at a sports bar.

Oh, and there is a hot bartender named Brooke that is pretty entertaining."}
{"text":"Best Margaritas ever and our favorite place for happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place is great ! Great food and great environment. This place accommodated ever aspect of our visit. We had a big party go into lunch today and although Zipps doesn't take reservations we still called ahead anyway. We know that we can be a handful with the kids running back and forth and part of our party in the bar but our server Kathy was awesome! She did an awesome job chasing us around both parts of the restaurant. The kids were occupied in the kids zone and the adults were all having a good time. The food is always good as well. My husband and I got the Monaco foccacia with the delicious onion rings and an order of golden medium wings. Which are to die for. Plus the weekend HH with big beers and tasty zipparitas on special made it even better. This is a great place to meet up with friends and family. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Golden Medium Wings. Need I say more? Ok, fine. Honestly, the rest of the food at Zipps is nothing to rave about, but why are you ordering anything other than the wings? If you want something to compliment the wings try the chips and guac or the mozzarella sticks which are wrapped in wonton vs. the traditional heavy bread crumbs. Other than that don't stray.

Do, however, give your server a hard time. They're a lot of fun! And do order a Zipparita to wash down your wings."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the burgers, beer and atmosphere here! Got a game to watch? You need to come here! There are TVs everywhere and a band of fellow sports watchers that will cheer and boo with you! The burgers are about my only favorite thing here to eat. Everything else is just OK. The beer is cold and there are plenty of options on and off the tap. Great happy hour."}
{"text":"food was decent, beer was cold but the servers looked like they just rolled out of bed.  They didn't comb their hair and if the front of the house doesn't look presentable can only imagine what is going on in back of the house where my good is being cooked.  I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The wings are fantasic here and great prices on happy hour, big place with many tvs..i will be back..thx"}
{"text":"I went with the family on a Friday night.   The wait was about 15 to 20 minutes.   The service was good.  We got wings and mozzarella sticks as starters.  The wings were great.  The mozzarella sticks are a little different, they're wrap in Wong tong wraps  vs the traditional breading.  I don't think I'll order those again, the family didn't like them. We ordered chessebuger and onion rings and the kids ordered pizza and a salad.   It felt like forever for the food to arrive and when it did it was vold. There's nothing worse than cold food.  The waitress told it back and when it was returned the hamburger was over cooked and the cheese was completely  melted off.  The onion rings were burnt from being cooked again.  Will I go back . . . Maybe for the drinks but NOT For the food."}
{"text":"Great service and food when opened up. Been there few times after but everything started to go downhill eventually. Service with attitude, greasy and under cooked food, water down drinks. Will not go there again. It was a good place for being close to home but sports bars like that are dime a dozen here. I am still struggling with my earlier lunch intake!"}
{"text":"The service was really terrible, the girl with the very short bangs kept staring aggressively at our table at two individuals and seemed to want to get a rise out of us. This was my first visit here and I have to say I will not be returning because the aggressive server/hostess. I hope she isn't like this with other people because it will surely make other guests at the least uneasy."}
{"text":"Overpriced crappy service - onion wings were cold and rubbery (like calamari) - server didn't care- 7.50 for a little lettuce pecans cranberries and goat cheese - fished   Out plenty of old lettuce. No good options for vegetarians 


Not worth 70 bucks

{"text":"Service was very slow the night 3 of us were in for dinner and it wasn't busy. I would have been more forgiving with the service of the food were better. Less than average bar food. Cold and greasy!"}
{"text":"We have been to another Zipps nearby and absolutely loved it-we're from out of town- and decided to go to this one for dinner. The food was great once again but today the service was horrendous. It was self seating and we were acknowledged pretty quickly, it was downhill from here. At the other zipps we were met very often, here we were rarely tended to. Our waiter screwed up multiple orders, then took a very long time to get our correct orders back to us. After all this, we were improperly charged in about 8 ways including added sides, cheese on regular burgers, and bigger drinks. After all this, we were not apologized to once. I recommend never coming to this location, and if this was our first time at a Zipps we wouldn't go to the other zipps either, but luckily we had a great experience and look forward to going to a different location in the future."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely fantastic. Possibly the best place we've seen in the Phoenix area so far. Great place to watch games and good atmosphere. The staff was also very good, we were immediately acknowledged and sat, and our waiter was very knowledgeable and patient. The tv situation is good not great, a few bigger tvs would definitely help. The music is for the most part all current hits. The mozzarella sticks were unique, but better than expected and I would definitely recommend them. The golden wings were also amazing, along with the buffalo focaccias."}
{"text":"BAD, BAD, BAD.

First of all let me preface by saying my fiance and I have been to many of the Zips around town and enjoyed the food and atmosphere but this new location in Chandler is a HORRIBLE!  We sat down at the bar on a Saturday evening for a few brews and munchies and to watch some games but we never got waited on!  The regular bar tender passed us by at least 3 times and the blonde behind the bar was doing dishes and just ignored us completely.  Some young guys walked up a few stools down and she practically ran to help them passing us by again.  We were blown away on how terrible the service is at the Chandler location. We walked out after 30 minutes having never been waited on.  We have a home in Chandler and we will NEVER be back to this god awful restaurant again!  Fire the entire staff!!"}
{"text":"ok place for a cheap beer at happy hour, but not much when it comes to food selection, you would expect more of the typical 'sports bar fare', but the selection is minimal. Usually busy at happy hour, but always have gotten good service, sometimes so busy can't get a seat at the bar. I would not go out of my way to go here, but if all you want is a quick cold one one your way home, cool."}
{"text":"The atmosphere  at Zipps is perfect for watching the game with the guys, or getting some grub with your girl. The grapefruit draft is the best beer I've yet to have. Zipps is the perfect place to come right after football practice, zip on down to Zipps!"}
{"text":"Great bar food! Excellent fries and onion rings, very good salads, focaccia's and pizza. Good atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"No good beers. Wings are OK although the celery they served should have gone in the trash (like white and puny, way too far into the heart of the celery bunch)...
Got a nice waitress when we moved from a booth (the first waitress told us that our baby's stroller was blocking the aisle (we were the second table in the dining room)). Have had onion rings here before which were good but today they had a weird and hard coating. Got a Greek salad which had almost no feta, icky black olives from a can (NOT kalamata) and the dressing was a balsamic vinaigrette and not a bit Greek dressing...
I hear the zipparita are great but never tried them..."}
{"text":"Clown manager would rather turn away business than sit people walking through the door. Five open tables, but apparently if you don't have more than four people they won't sit you (we had three people). Half way through the game still turning away people rather than sitting them at open tables, what a JOKE! Guaranteed the tables were open the entire game. Stupid policy by a ridiculous establishment. Food is greasy and disgusting, beer is warm. Plenty of better options around, AVOID."}

We sat down at 705 and finally were able to place our order at 725. A table of 8 people came in a while after us and ordered food and they got their appetizers before we got our food, a burger and fish tacos. I complained and was told they ordered appetizers and that our food would be out shortly, it's been over ten minutes and we still haven't received our food. We finally got our food at 804."}
{"text":"0 Stars is how I rate the Ocotillo Zipps Bar & Grill at 4060 S. Arizona Ave, Chandler, AZ but Yelp forces you to give at least one star. I went there during lunch today (6/10/15) to celebrate a co-worker's 20 yr anniversary at our company.  She chose the restaurant. Since they don't have a food allergy menu like most mainstream restaurants do these days,  I bought food that I can eat from other restaurant. The manager comes out & tells me that I can't eat my food in their restaurant and that he's not making me throw it away,  but that I can't eat it in their restaurant. Really? Most restaurants I go to have menu options for people with food allergies. Others have always allowed me to being my own food.  First of all,  since they don't have a food allergy menu or options for people with food allergies,  Zipps is not a place I would ever go to for food. Second,  since the manager treated me in such a disrespectful way,  not even seeking to understand, I, my family,  and friends will NEVER set foot in any Zipps ever again."}

{"text":"I was so excited when I saw signs go up that a Zipps was coming to this area of town! I work around that area and first thing that entered my mind was \"Love their happy hour!!\" SOOO disappointed!! Don't get me wrong, I still love their happy hour just NOT at this Zipps! I will drive across town to go to the one on Ray Rd after my first and most definitely my last visit to this location. We went in on a Friday afternoon to have drinks and watch the Packers' game... I get that the game was preseason, but the manager told us that he would not play the sounds of the game instead of the loud music because \"they\" don't like it when we have to switch it. When asked who \"they\" was, he just said \"them\". hmmm... he stated that a few people had called in to ask if a high school football game would be on in the bar and he told them that  they would be playing it so he couldn't switch the sounds from the NFL to the  high school game! The NFL game started at 5 and the HS game didn't start until 7!!!! Are you kidding me??!! I would have been perfectly fine (since he \"promised\") with him switching the NFL to the HS game when it started- but that excuse is ridiculous! Our service became crappy after our discussion with the manager as well..."}
{"text":"Editing my review because the last few times we have been in have been great! The service is very attentive and the food comes out just like we ordered it. I don't know our servers name that we usually have but she is great! Keep up the good work.."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with our food choices. I ordered the Greek salad. The chicken looked like crumbs, there was way to much vinegar. Not a good presentation at all. We also ordered the cops and salsa appetizer. The salsa tasted like tomatoe sauce there was no spice flavor to it. The guacamole wasn't  bad. Our waiter was good. If I come back it would be to watch a sports game and a beer."}
{"text":"For the love of everything, don't order the mozzarella sticks. They managed to ruin the most basic classic pub food app by putting it in an egg roll."}
{"text":"Quite literally Zipps on Mill Ave. in Tempe is a Horrible place to eat.... 

You walk in and nobody greets you... they are in a constant state of \"training\" new wait staff because the manager is a total douchebag... and they are on the edge of going out of business... so the food is cheap and they \"pad the bill\" with all kinds of undisclosed up charges...

And their turnover is high because wait staff likely quit all the time because the food is such poor quality.. 

The drinks at Zipps are watered down with the cheapest well liquor... yet they charge $6-$8 for a tiny drink during happy hour... 

The chicken wings were laced with margarine hot sauce that makes your stomach rumble with each bite,... their fryer oil is filthy... the ranch is like tartar sauce and rancid tasting...

The onion rings are the most disgusting looking I've ever seen and their burger meat is cheap and raunchy tasting....

We ordered our drinks for 3 people.... and it took 3 different waitresses 25 minutes to get our drinks... We ordered drinks before 7pm on a Friday Happy hour... the place was barren and empty... Now we know why....

We were told she 'got our drinks in'.... yet they charged us full price for the drinks and included an additional $2.25 undisclosed \"upcharge for each cheap well margarita with strawberry flavor...

The food is honestly disgusting at Zipps... the onion rings come out dark brown falling apart with the cheapest batter Ive ever witnessed, the $8.99 burger comes out on a cheap deformed tiny bun you could buy at a gas station...

I complained to the manager that the burger had decomposing lettuce on it... we also explained to two waitresses and the dickhead manager that we were overcharged for drinks and 3 times they made us wait for the check...

Each time they returned and refused to correct the full price drinks from happy hour... this manager has no authority yet when we left them with ZERO tip for their dishonesty I saw them adjusting the bill to get their tip out of the cash we paid... over $50 for the worst food... My husband stopped at circle K for 1000Mg Tums on the way home from this dirty poorly run tempe location.

They offered us a coupon for a future visit... we will never return to ANY Zipps location. The manager is a total douchebag that would not even take $5 off the bill or correct the terrible food production from their lame kitchen.. I am reporting them to the health inspector because you can get food poisoning at this location... It is THAT BAD.... 

But by all means check out the deplorable service, crappy food and horrible management and staff for yourself if you like living dangerously at Zipps which makes sense cause you get zero quality food, zip nada zilch for service and they lie to you and try to pad the bill.... then the manager comes over and tells you they agree with the waitress and rip you off... lovely... 

This restaurant is the worst Ive ever eaten at in AZ period.

I would not give them even one star... Why? Because they have no business being in the hospitality industry with their negative attitudes, lack of ethic and cheap tactics...

Buyer beware... go to PF Changs, Gordon Biersch or any reputable restaurant that can afford quality food... and to hire an actual staff.,..  this place sucks!"}
{"text":"Yes we were discriminated against.  A block from our house, we used to walk over there all the time.  We were there on opening day and have been regulars ever since.  

Now there is a new manager with a \"seating policy.\"  That meant that if you aren't young and hip looking, you are told that they don't have any tables for two.  Same thing happened to the two people checking in right in front of us.  The hostess was very rude to them so I tried to be extra nice so I wouldn't get treated like that.  Didn't help.

The manager was a total jerk about everything.  There were plenty of open tables, but they were \"saving them for more than two people.\"  It was 5:50 pm. That's when a young couple with a baby came in long after us, and they sat them at an empty table right away.   We were told by Cesar Rodriquez, the GM, that they were a \"party of 3\" so they got seated.  We looked around the restaurant, and just about every 4-top table or booth had 2 people at it.  

Total BS.  If you are over 55, don't bother going to this Zipp's.  We finally left because the staff was rude and kept smirking at us.  This used to be one of our favorite places, but now we will never go back."}
{"text":"Came in to watch the UConn and Kentucky game. Never been here before. Wings are amazing! TVs everywhere! I saw the waitresses and managers walking around talking to different customers by name and joking around with people. Seemed like all the customers and staff knew eachother. Reminds me of Cheers!"}
{"text":"Hamburgers were great - onion rings were very bland - fries were great.. But greasy.  Service was great and timely - but the sound level was extremely - extremely loud (don't understand why-place was only 1/2 full..)"}
{"text":"Ok, first I have to start out by saying that the Sweet Jalepeno burger might be the most amazing thing I have ever eaten in my entire life!! The complex combination of flavors is unbelievable & I find myself slathering it with their special sauce & licking it off my fingers (& hands and wrists..lol!).  That being said it may not be the best first date spot but a great value for sure.  For those that can't choose between fries & onion rings..no worries, they offer half and half combination for the same price.  The only bad thing is the service is SO SLOW, seriously slow & it doesnt seem to matter what time of day or day of the week.  Everytime I've been there its been over 30 mins before I get my food, although the service is always good, it's very slow."}
{"text":"Do not eat here.  The food is terrible.  I had the 1000 island burger.  There was no 1000 island dressing on it but it did have a load of cheap melted Velveeta cheese.  The hamburger meat was crumbling apart. Horrible.  The onion rings were like eating leather, dry and tough.  My wife had the fish and chips.  Tarter sauce was pure Mayonnaise. Yuck.  Same terrible onion rings.  If you want to drink beer and watch a game--maybe but eat there-- no way. The owners should be ashamed.  This place is due for a bar rescue episode."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this location for about 10+ years. We have always had excellent service and the food was great. Last time we came to dine-in. Our server was so slow, and food was even slower. There was probably only 5 other tables in the whole restaurant. We left unhappy but everyone has a off day so we didn't think much of it. Today i called in a order, stood at the bar for 10-15 minutes. The bartenders were not busy (open tables and seats at the bar) they looked at me and didnt say anything. I went and got the \"manager\" i told my story too. Which he didnt really seem to care. You lost a loyal customer. Reading fellow reviewers, maybe zipps management should look into this problem...poor service combined with subpar food seems to be the only consistent thing here."}
{"text":"Not happy about being charged .50 cents for extra wing sauce on my buffalo chicken salad that I held the blue cheese on and got double chicken. I mean they couldnt spare another tablespoon of sauce? 

Atmosphere was good otherwise. I will be back but not happy this time."}
{"text":"Zipps is such a great place and people say that it is the worst sports grills ever, but it is the best one! The service is great and on time. The manager is very friendly and the food is great! I suggest going there for dinner/lunch when you want to have a good time."}
{"text":"The only good thing at this dump is the burger. The sides came stone cold. Waited 10 mins for sodas and another 25 for food that arrived incorrect. The server didn't come to check the food at all once she put it in front of us. The funny thing? This place was maybe 1/4 full. The guy executing the meal brought us $5 Zipps certificate. Way to rectify the issue. You send us the wrong food and you think we will come back? Hell no"}
{"text":"Went for lunch during work. Ordered the BBQ bacon cheddar burger with fries. Burger came out soggy with grease and an old smashed bun. The \"onion rings\" in the burger were nothing more than raw onions coated with semi cooked batter. The fries were awful. Raw potatoes soaked in frier grease. My friend ordered the Club sandwich. Their version of a club consisted of 1 slice ham, 1 slice turkey, 2 strips of bacon, 1 limp piece of lettuce and 2 very small slices if sour dough bread. We told the waitress the fries were not cooked all the way and all we got was \"I'm sorry\" and she walked away. After complaining to a second waitress the manager finally showed up. His only response was \"I know it looks better at other places\". Seriously???? Even though we refused to eat the food we still got a bill for the full amount. Wow. FAIL"}
{"text":"Love this place! Girls are great! Very nice. Beware of the creepy customer Ronnie. He has been banned but sneaks in when new people work. Great place!"}

Would love to go again after a spring training game!!!#Go Royals!!"}
{"text":"My ex-gf and I first discovered Zipps on Mill in Tempe and had several REALLY good experiences there from 2015-16.

One day around that time, we were on Warner in Gilbert and decided to try the Zips there.  We both commented that is was not near as good and said we probably wouldn't go back.

My burger was dry, and not as flavorful, and the fries were over-cooked -- and even though the dining area was almost empty -- the waitress was not NEARLY as friendly or attentive as we'd found on MIll.

This week on a whim, I decided to try this location again.

Glad I did because it was more like the Mill avenue Zipps this time.

I had a mushroom burger...and it was thick and juicy, and tasted really great -- and the bun was fresh and soft and tasty.  The fries were cooked perfectly.  My mouth is watering thinking about it.  : )

--------------------

EDIT: Oops -- just remembered after reading other reviews -- I got a 1/2 order of fries & 1/2 order of onion rings.

There were only a few onion rings and they were dry, and cold, and hard like they'd been sitting around for a while.  They had little flavor too.

I almost forgot about them because there were -- thankfully only a few -- and everything else was good.  But I won't try them again at this location.

-----------------------

Anywho -- Since I've had mixed experiences at this Zipps I'll give it three stars -- but if it was just based on my last visit there I'd make it a 4 (in spite of the onion rings).

I'll update if I go again."}
{"text":"Best burgers. Golden medium wings are amazing and always consistent. I've wasted a lot of money here. Its almost dangerous because its so close."}
{"text":"BEST WINGS I'VE EVER HAD!! Love love love the medium golden wings!! One of my favorite foods ever. Great place to go especially during football season! Great drink specials too. Their burgers are delicious as well. Do yourself a favor & go here!!!"}
{"text":"AWESOME!! Happy Hour is phenomenal! The Golden Sauce for the Chicken Skewers is incredible. $1.50 for a slice of cheese pizza, $3 pints, $6 chicken skewers.

We have no experience sitting in the bar.

Looking over the other reviews I'm not sure what happened while they were there. We have never had a BAD experience there. One time we ordered something we didn't like- our problem. One minor issue that I don't even remember aside from remembering that they went above and beyond with a free dessert and Zipps cash to make it right. Then one night the dinosaur game wasn't working- we got our money refunded AND free pick of a couple dinosaurs for each kid from the game guy.

We come at happy hour and it's been great every time. We love it."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed with Zipps this time. I used to come a lot for the good and sports but the chicken skewers are half the size they used to be and there's no game sounds, it's night club music. I understand pumping it up later but it's basketball and hockey playoffs and there's no game sounds. Always love the  service, never a problem there. Just disappointed in the atmosphere."}
{"text":"There's nothing like a local hangout spot and this is mine!! My friend and I are there a few times a week because of the great food and awesome staff who take the time to get to know you. I'm a wing snob and these are by far the best I've had. The Daily specials are great as well as Happy Hour."}
{"text":"My name is Chris and I love zips but there is an awful waitress named Michelle ! She has fake boobs but that doesn't distract from the train disaster of a face. The service was awful and she actually said that I wasn't 21 after I showed her my id! Rude and I hope she can put some of the hot air in her fake tits in her little brain!"}
{"text":"This place is fun but the food is not that great. Everything is usually cold or too greasy l."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times. I have been when it is slow and I have been on busy NFL Sundays. I must say that I have always received the best service at the bar. Service at the tables is not so great. The food is above average for a bar. They have the best salads and somewhat healthy offerings you will find to offset your giant mug of beer! I found it in my last 2 Sunday NFL trips here to watch games that they had more hostess than actual servers. It took a good 30 minutes to get a beer while at all time 4! Hostess were constantly standing up front on their phones and chatting together. There were tables dirty and servers that needed help...how does this make sense to management to pay 4 girls hourly to gossip while there were no tables to be filled?"}
{"text":"Zipps used to be the go to place to watch any sporting event. Then they changed the menu in what seems to be nothing more than a cash grab. I hope that they see the error of their ways and bring back the old specials. Until then the group that I watch sports with will by going to the sports bar we used to go to before Zipps. Someone who works here seems to think that the majority of the people going here weren't coming for the specials. Guess what you're wrong. That's why people went to Zipps, cheap beer and decent food."}
{"text":"Small highschool cafeteria. Not worth the dime."}
{"text":"Group of 6 for lunch, all orders were written down and all orders were wrong. The Server had no apology and the manager didn't manage. No compensation was given, but $5 Zipp Bucks were handed out after checks were given. Zipps Bucks implies we are returning? I don't think so. Turn around and go to Blue 32 up the road or don't return when these two Super Stars are working."}
{"text":"Beer order came right away, but for the life of me I don't understand why it takes so long to get an order of wings. For whatever reason, crowded or not, it takes an inordinate amount of time to get food once it's ordered."}
{"text":"I hate to do this because I like the Zipparitas,  and the people behind the bar are nice. I stopped eating at Zipps because of their serious roach problem. I have seen 8 roaches on or near the bar. The final straw is their policy of allowing people to chew tobacco and use spit cups at the bar. Itis repulsive to see and smell someone spitting giant globs off brown saliva into a cup."}
{"text":"Positives: Great Food and service 

Negatives: The beer selection is insulting. 

The set up of the televisions could use an upgrade. Plus it would be nice if there weren't so many children."}
{"text":"Service at this particular Zipps is horrible. My friend and I usually visit the location on Via de Ventura because they are always so good to us, but we live closer to this one, so we went there this afternoon to catch some of the games. We sat at a high top next to the bar, and waited 15 minutes. No one ever came over to greet us, or say someone would be right with us. The best part was, there was a group of servers sitting by the expo line just chatting with one another. Other people were getting upset because they wanted refills. Zipps needs some serious improvement on their brand consistency, and maybe new management to ensure their patrons are getting treated correctly. Food order mix ups are forgivable because that's just human error, but to not even greet a table is completely unacceptable. We will stick to our Via de Ventura location, thanks!"}
{"text":"I went in with my husband for food and beer.  The beer has always been good and cold,  and the food normally fair to good.

Well, on this visit the burgers were excellent!  Cooked to order, fries fresh and hot, and the server was on point!

We left happy and will definitely return for our next beer and burger trip.

J."}
{"text":"I have to agree with another reviewers comments. We have been going to zipps in Gilbert for years, used to go 3-4 times a month and always had great food and excellent service. Always had a table of at least 10 with us. Now we only go once a month if that because food and service is hit or miss never know what you are going to get. We like the location and when we go in we hope everything is good--service and food. I don't think a menu change is needed just be consistent on the food quality and service and most importantly hire a staff that cares about quality food and service."}
{"text":"This place is a disgrace! Servers where awful management is a joke and the food was to say the least less than satisfactory! Please avoid this joke of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Zipps is the type of sports bar you want to be your Cheers.  However, the thing that keeps me from making Zipps my Cheers is the crappy service.  Food is decent as far as bar food goes, but I can never get over the service.  First, always have to sit at different tables because the waitress cannot separate the bill from person to person.  Second, if you can get your waitress to come over, the order usually shows up wrong.  Every time I'm there, I have to walk up to the bar to get another drink.  Also shotty service there too.  Drinks are too weak (and I'm a lightweight) and you are waiting for an obscene amount of time.  The only reason I go over there is when a friend of mine wants to meet up there as she lives right around the corner.  It's merely convenient, nothing more.  We're actually thinking of ditching the place all together...

If management would just get their waitresses trained on manners, promptness and accuracy, the place would be great."}
{"text":"Where else can you get a giant beer for under 4 bucks and the staff just keeps them rolling? Love this place."}
{"text":"We walked in the door and the hostess was just rude and not really willing to help us. So as we waited for the rest of our party to arrive we waited in the bar at a larger table. The server, Brooke, was sweet and greeted us immediately. I asked her if we could move a table over so our whole party could sit and she said she had to ask her manager. As she's asking her manager they are literally starring at us while they are talking.. not professional. Then the manager makes the server come over and deliver the bad news.. Shocker!"}
{"text":"This place has really fallen apart. I used to enjoy bringing people in here. I think last night was my final night at Zipps getting food. I could run this place with my eyes closed instead of mangers ( there is one decent older manger who seems to care ). The food has really fallen apart and the service is worse that waiters and waitress at an all you can eat buffet in kingman as."}
{"text":"The food and drink deals at Zipps are great!  They have Happy Hour from 3-7 and 8-? M-F.  The golden wings and chicken skewers are my favorite.  This a great place to hang out with your bros to watch a game and enjoy a few beers and if your bros don't judge try a zipparita!  The reason this location is only getting four stars because the setup is a little funky, not enough seating and the tv's are weak for a sports bar."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere were fine but the food was awful. Ordered chips/salsa: salsa was cheap and gross. Chips were only thing that tasted good. Greek Salad: iceberg lettuce that was frozen with a few veg/chz on top. Ate a few bites but couldn't make myself eat anymore. My son got the kids chicken strips which neither him nor my husband (who loves chicken strips) could stomach. My husband said his burger was fine but nothing to rave about and the sweet potato chips were blah. We definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Bitchiest bartender in the valley!  She had such an  over the top reaction to my friend forgetting her ID you'd think she was auditioning for a soap opera. For future reference, a simple sorry we can't serve you without proof of age would be fine. And, just to clarify the situation, my friend wasn't being rude or obnoxious or trying to convince the bartender to get her a drink.  She simply realized after ordering that she had left her ID at work. The bartender went on to give a loud, extremely rude lecture on how she was not going to serve her tonight or any other night without the ID. Ummm..we weren't asking you to. So due to this unpleasant, uncomfortable experience I can't say I'm eager to come back anytime soon. Who wants to be yelled at for doing absolutely nothing?"}

Tonight we brought a large party at an early hour, intentionally knowing the place would not be too busy to handle us.  Sure enough there were plenty of open and empty tables.  Fitting us in should not have been a problem.  But the manager made it a problem.  

The manager was so rude and hostile to us it was unreal.  He was clearly inept to handle a large group.  I have worked in the restaurant business for many years and I was appalled at how he treated many members in our party.  The servers handled the situation with grace and ease, it's unfortunate their manager couldn't learn from them.  We tip well, we were not difficult or demanding and easily brought in over $350 in an hour and a half for 20 people. We should not have been treated so poorly.  I have never taken the time to complain about anything on any customer review page.  But this situation warranted it.

Bottom line, don't go here if you have a big group.  I won't ever bring a large group back again to this Zipps location."}
{"text":"I was excited to see Zipps was open and decided to go there with my husband and kids.  We got there at 6:30pm on a Tuesday night and the place was packed. Luckily we were immediately seated because there was space on the patio. 

I didn't get a good look inside, but it seemed really bright and did not have much ambiance. I know it's a sports grill, but still. The patio is nicer if the weather is decent.

We ordered three dozen wings (mild,mild golden and hot), chicken skewers, chips & salsa, and pizza.  It's a good thing we ordered the chips because it took them over 45 minutes to serve us the food. We looked around and noticed there were a lot of people also waiting to eat. 

The wings were decent and you can't beat the happy hour price of $6/dozen before 7pm. The wings are more crispy than juicy. We ordered the mild wings for the kids. They had a little kick to them, so next time I will just order them dry. The kids enjoyed the cheese pizza slices and the chicken skewers. The skewers comes with two sauces you can choose from and they had a light batter. They're bland without the dipping sauce (perfect for kids who love ranch or BBQ sauce). The chips were o.k.  Don't expect the thick corn tortilla chips you get at a Mexican restaurant. It comes with a side of spicy guacamole and salsa.

We normally love Zipps, but I think we will wait for them to work out their issue with the kitchen before going back any time soon. It's obvious by the crowd that this area wants them to succeed. The kitchen is not able to keep up with the demand in the front. It's a good thing our kids weren't starving because that would have made our experience worse."}
{"text":"Have gone there twice with family and service was horrible. Even after a year of opening. We never consider going there."}
{"text":"The chicken fingers are horrible. The breading used is meant for egg rolls and such.  Not to mention my extra soggie fries....ewww"}
{"text":"Worst sports bar around primarily due to the piss poor service and terrible food. I don't come on here to complain this is only the 2nd yelp review I've written in my life. This place is awful. God forbid you bother a server or bartender for a refill. There's a lot of talent in the mill Ave area and this place is the local baby mama day job. Get some energetic, outgoing, ambitious employees who actually want to be there. The food is terrible but it's a cheap sports bar you get what you pay for. If you order a slide of pizza it comes on a TORTILLA!Went to another Zips locations and the service was much better. If you're hungry for more than Wings, don't come here!"}
{"text":"Better Zipps than the Ray Rd or Ahwatukee for sure!  Much better service & quality of food. Had the taco salad - spicier than others, and better - and the chicken focaccia - MUCH better, finally enough dressing without having to PAY for a side of it.  Services stopped to check on us several times - even the manager came to check on us. SO glad this is so close to our new house."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great prices, great atmosphere!! Favorite place to wind down after. Long day"}
{"text":"Consistently terrible and SLOW service. Great happy hour specials both food and drink but I just can't justify how terrible the service is. With some decent management this could place be something special, for now my money goes elsewhere."}
{"text":"The service was so so, and the food as well. There are so many restaurants in Gilbert, it is doubtful we will return. You need to return right away to see if guests are ready to order and after food arrives ask to see if guest got what they ordered. We eat out often and expect better service."}
{"text":"This place is simply in a bad location. Not because it doesn't do great business - it does. Hopefully that will slow down. It's way crowded and the servers are new and clueless. Bartenders are cool. But....the food is average. The clientele is a lot of riff raff that is not local. It can be a very annoying crowd. Most importantly...do not drink and even think of driving out of here. I've seen young people walk out the front door with beers in hand and get in their cars. I let the manager know and he was not interested. I've now noticed the fuzz setting up nearby and pulling cars into a nearby gas station lot and busting people left and right. The establishment does not care. Just be damn careful. This place is not worth the risk."}
{"text":"We were very excited about Zipps coming to South Chandler. The first visit was not good. We sat outside and the service was just awful. They were busy, so we chalked it up to maybe a lack of staff. Food was ok. The second visit, hubby and me sat at the bar and had wings and a burger. The burger looked like one I would expect to be served at McDonalds. It did not look like 8 ounces of beef to me. The wings were just ok. There is not much separation between the bar and dining area. This restaurant is insanely loud no matter where you sit. We have not been back in over a year."}
{"text":"3 of us had to wait 1/2 hour for a table because you have be at least 4 for to sit at a 6 top table. The 6 top stayed empty my entire meal. Once seated the food is decent and server was awesome considering how busy the place was, she deserved the 20%

The manager is terrible there was a table behind us that were 2 toddlers with no parents. They sat there for 40 minutes when a couple of women showed up to check on them. Turns out the women were at the bar and left the two 5 year olds at a table. Wow."}
{"text":"We went Saturday night and it was a bad experience. We were there for 20 mins before most of us getting drinks, the rest of our group of 6 never even got their waters. Then we were there for an hour before our server decided to make an appearance to take our food order. Then they thought it would be a great idea to bring our appetizers and entrees at the same time. To top of off the food was below par. The fries were extra greasy from the bottom of the basket. We were there for a total of 2 hrs for poor service and bad food. This was our first and last time here!"}
{"text":"Stein of beers are priced pretty good.  Game nights get super packed so go early to save a seat. Kitchen closes at midnight which is too early when your buzz kicks in around 1am."}
{"text":"Always great service at this location. Very constant with drinks and food. The wings are always cooked perfect. Missy is a great bartender, always friendly!"}
{"text":"Great place for wings! Service is usually good. Some days i have to wait a bit. Best place for drinks!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm scoring them a 3 is because they really do have a great happy hour. For drinks that is. The food was not good. My husband and I got the chicken rolls. They came with 2 rolls. My husbands tasted nothing like mine and not in a good way. Which was odd. The Philly Cheese Steak Focaccia wasn't bad, but also wouldn't order it again. I don't know maybe I ordered the wrong things."}
{"text":"Long story short the place looks great with a million large tv's. We came for lunch and it took nearly 25 minutes to get 2 salads and a sandwich. 

The salad was fine so I have no complaints with that. I'm probably grasping at straws but the iced tea tasted good. Ha!!!

The place wasn't that busy and I don't know what happened that made that tale so long. 
I will go back to give it a second chance and will hope for better.   From listening to a friend of mine I expected more."}
{"text":"DO NOT consume any beverage that is served in a mug, pint glass, wine glass, shot glass, etc, etc.. Trust me, I've been bartending for almost ten years and I can assure you all that none of  the before mentioned glassware is properly washed and sanitized. Disgusting. Lousy place to watch a game, as the T.Vs are obscured by posts and ventilation ducts and the T.Vs on the patio are useless until the sun sets. The food ? Well..ya get what ya pay for.. Stick with bottled beer though. I know those large beers sound like a good idea but trust me, f#$%ing disgusting.."}
{"text":"I would recommenced this place for a game....good specails, not the best food but not bad for the price"}
{"text":"Went in for a beer and a shot with having no previous liquor. Turned us down for NO REASON so just like a gentleman went to the Bar and Got *** since the young Mexican guy was turning us down in such a rude way. He was using racial slures and since there is many other Bars we decided to turn our WATERS down and go elsewhere. I would not recommends this place. A small Mexican kid that probably got picked on in elementary school cut us off pre mature. I NEVER write reviews but I play for the Angels and hardly ever go out. But this has LITERALLY got to be the worst place in TEMPE. I just have to say way to go! Thumbs up to the Mexican kid that made the decision! I'm sober and writing this niw and in my way to have a good time. I would never in a million years write this but what a way to send us out. First  stop !! Skip this place! Waste of time. And oh ya my Bar tab is usually around $650... Forget this place !"}
{"text":"5 of us sat down and ordered a shot and a beer. With us previously have NOT been drinking, the manager came up and said he was not gonna serve us hard liquor... We got up and left. Have fun at this place!"}
{"text":"Beware of Roaches on the patio!! 
Last Friday night we went to have a few drinks with some friends from out of town. They asked us to pick a place with a relaxing patio since the weather was nice. Much to our surprise the restaurant had invited a few guests of their own (the ones you should never see in a restaurant). After 8:30pm the patio was taken over by roaches!!! They were crawling on the rock wall, the patio, our feet, the benches. It got to the point where I had to get up and leave halfway through my drink. My husband stuck around long enough to pay our tab and quickly followed behind me. We weren't the only ones who noticed either... The woman behind us jumped up at one point yelling that one had crawled across their table. I understand that this is an outdoor patio in AZ so a few bugs is expected but this was a full infestation.  We really enjoy the other Chandler location so we hope that you get this under control ASAP. We will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"If you want a fun sports bar experience and pay awesome prices, then Zipps is for you. Their happy hour specials and their daily specials are just extraordinary. Some may say that Zipps is \"no place special\", but hey - it's special if you want to have a  few beers and some wings during happy hour and spend like $10."}
{"text":"Just terrible. Save yourself the trouble and dine at a restaurant that takes pride and accountability for what they are serving."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great service but the food is served too salty and oily.  Anything ordered on the menu that is fried will be dripping in grease. They never drain the fried items. Their fries are underdone, soggy and oversalted.  Their Golden Wings sauce is wonderful but if you want enough sauce to cover the wings you'll pay extra.  In fact, anything you order as an extra (i.e. ranch dressing) will be an extra charge.  For the prices they charge they shouldn't be so cheap.  It's the ownership, not the manager.  All the other Zipps and Goldie's are the same way."}
{"text":"Nothing special  at all. Boring place terrible layout. Not one special thing on the menu just over priced simple food that was not once prepared correct. Under cooked fries how can you even mess that up. Save your time and money not even good as regular fried bar food."}
{"text":"Went to Zipps for a quick beer with friends after golfing at McCormick Ranch. It was happy hour and fairly busy.  There was plenty of help, and the service was excellent.  Food was typical sports bar food, but the happy hour prices were great, and everyone was was able to find something they liked on the menu. I will certainly go back to watch a game or for a quick beer."}
{"text":"Poor taste!  We love this place but the male bartender is wearing a U of A hat while ASU playing, not Tucson. Poor choice for sales."}
{"text":"Terrible management. Inconsistent carding policies. Crabby servers. Too dark, extremely loud, and below average food. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"my spot! service is good, drinks are good, green chili burger is yummy! plenty of screens of course, walking distance to my house so , perfect."}
{"text":"The only reason we go to Zipps is because the Whiskey Rose shut down. When going to Zipps, you can expect it to be LOUD, poor service (3 waitresses in one night, forgotten orders, waiting forever for service) and mediocre food. The beer selection is good but the prices are high, in my opinion ($4.75 for a draft of Blue Moon). We went to Zipps last night and I was very disappointed to see that they charged me $.50 for onions with my chili. I can understand charging extra for cheese, which is also $.50 but for a tablespoon onions? Come on! That is just being cheap and obnoxious. The chili tasted like it came out of a can. I wish I could have had a burger but recent dental work requires soft food and chili was the only thing on their menu that I could eat. I don't think we will ever go back, especially when the Ginger Monkey opens later this Fall. Zipps does nothing to make me want to go back. Nothing."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience!  Sad, really sad.  This place has no management, even if they have folks that hold that title.

I tried going to this Zipps once before, and there was just too much crowd.  I liked the one on Via de Venture just fine, so I was excited to try again - surely crowds like that must mean there is something good going on.  Boy, was I disappointed.  I expected a noisy, TV-heavy atmosphere, and that was as expected (a little overboard by a next table of hockey fans that were very loud, like I cared about their \"sports wisdom\").  The service was just a shade worse than very bad, the food was worse.  At least there was an NBA playoff game on a couple of TVs, so there was that one ray of sunshine in an otherwise sad and bleak picture.   The server made apologies for the kitchen, even pointed out that two managers were in there trying to make it better.  Servers, if you have to do that you have already lost the battle.  He didn't apologize for his own mediocrity - one drink refill in a 2-hour ordeal is usually only expected during airline flight delays.  The kitchen clearly had no idea what they were doing;  I just hope they don't poison anyone.  First food failure - chips and salsa.  I mean, really, how do you mess up chips and salsa?  It took a ridiculous amount of time for them to come out (20 minutes, really?), and were definitely not worth the wait.  I come from Texas, and there these would be considered a felony offense.  The chips were stale and almost salt free, so no crunch or flavor.  The guacamole was already browning, so far from fresh,  The salsa, though only about a two-tablespoon-sized portion, was better, but mild - like zero on a scale of spiciness.  Why does a sports bar fear spice? I won't even go into their combining sweet and spicy in too many ways. So the appetizer set a bad stage, but it got worse.  There were five in my party, and the meals came out after another long wait, and in three stages.  My daughter and I got our's first.  Mine was already cold, so it must have sat waiting on others for quite a while.  My daughter's was at least still warm when it came out.  Several minutes later, two more came out, and then another several minutes for the last one.  At least they were still warm.  Mine was inedible by the time my party was all served.  I don't know how good it might have been warm, but cold it was not in the least enjoyable.  I am no food snob, and I can say with authority that the Whataburger I had the prior night was embarassingly better than this sad Zipps offering.  I sent it away and went without.  I'd rather go hungry than force myself to eat the product of a horribly mismanaged effort to separate me from my hard-earned money.  Oh, but then add to that the filthy state of the restrooms.  Just one more piece of proof that the management of this Zipps location has given up, assuming that they ever had even the remotest hint of any management ability.  The manager offered me three $5 gift cards as an attempt at service recovery, I just told her I wouldn't be back so it wouldn't do any good.  There are too many great restaurant options to go back to such a miserable failure.  If you decide to go, plan to drink heavily - the sad food and service might be more bearable.  You'll be in good company."}
{"text":"I don't like policy about being in bar & our designated driver couldn't be over there with us. My son will be 21 in February...really? He doesn't even drink. Everything else i enjoy here."}
{"text":"Manager is an asshole. He brought our food out and he set my boyfriends chili bowl down on the ledge of the bar where it was tipping over because he was paying attention to someone that was talking to him. My boyfriend was across the street. I reached over to grab the chili before it all spilled out and it knocked his beer over. Waitress at bar cleaned it up and brought another beer but he was charged for it when we closed out. We asked for the manager. Same guy came back. I
Reminded him what had happened. He says \"I didn't spill it\". I told him indirectly u did because of the way u out the chili on table. He argued with us abc refused to take it off Bill. We aren't 21 year old kids looking for a free beer. We are 50 year olds hoping he would do the right thing. He didn't. We left no tip and explained to the waitress that that was our only way to express our displeasure with him. Told her to go show him that she lost her tip because of him. It was a $5 beer. Whatever happened to the customer is always right. Do what u need to do to please the customer. A free $5 beer. Really. We left no tip and told waitress to go show him what he cost her. He will never be back."}
{"text":"One of the best wings in town hands down. Service is always amazing and they have more than enough tv's available for viewing as well as a vast variety of shows playing so there's something for everyone."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner and come here often. Today, I came to enjoy some drinks with several friends. We chose a high top about 6 feet away from the bar. The stools at the table have no backs so I grabbed one of the EIGHT EMPTY bar chairs with backs. I suffer from chronic back pain due to a sports injury so I needed the support. Five minutes later, the general manager came and asked that I return the chair. I explained my chronic back pain to him. Instead of providing great customer service, he continued to insist that I return the bar stool. He said \"the bar was designed to have backs and the high tops were designed to have no backs.\" I said, I understand and I will safely return it when I leave. I took the seat from the very end so I didn't destroy the \"aesthetic\" look of this bar. I was blown away at how the general manager would not want his guests to be comfortable. It gets better... The entire night, there were an average of 8 empty bar chairs. Even better, there was a bar chair sitting in the corner of the restaurant with no purpose... He could have given me that chair for one hour. The general manager clearly has no desire to make his customers happy."}
{"text":"My dad ordered hot wings and they came out uncooked, he asked for another order to replace them and the waitress said yes, however she then asked \"can I get you guys a brownie skillet?\" we assumed it was complimentary because of their mistake on the wings, but when we got the bill they charged us for the skillet and both orders of wings. My dad asked if she could take off the raw wings off the check and she said my mistake, then he said I thought the skillet was complimentary because of the wings? she denied and said she has to always ask. We didn't really care all that much but c'mon. My meal which was a buffalo foccacia was also cold. We enjoy the atmosphere here and like coming for football games, but we now prefer another sports bar."}
{"text":"This place sucks major d***. I would not recommended this place at all. My food came cold and tasted horrible."}
{"text":"Great sports bar. Good beer, decent food fast service. You can get Steins of beer! :) Only thing I wish the had a bigger selection of dark beers, as they only have one :( - Over all though nice place to get some grub and watch some ESPN."}
{"text":"Service is so so.They cook their  burgers until they are unrecognizable.  I have been to other Zipps and had better experiences.  This one needs a serious staff make over."}
{"text":"It really frustrated me reading these reviews. I used to bartend in north Scottsdale so maybe i'm just more patient than most. But everyone has to understand that any new restaurant takes time to get in the swing of things. I went in the other day with my two friends and were immediately greeted by the hosts who told us their would be a short wait. We got to our table and within just a couple minutes were greeted by our server who was smiling and knowledgeable about the happy hour specials. The food did take a while but the kitchen is just learning everything! Stop being rude about this place when its a great concept and everyone is trying really hard to be there for you. We enjoyed our food and will definitely be back to see how much this place will grow! Thank you zipps for coming to my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I like the food.  Beer specials are great!  Bar staff and management is good.  Why 2 stars?  The servers are crap!!  On two separate occasions I have had horrible service from the servers.  If you come without kids, do yourself a favor and sit at the bar.

First time:  10 of us come in for dinner.  There wasn't a hostess and a server tells us to sit any where.  Okay, but there's ten of us!  Can someone help us move tables together? Can someone offer any sort of help when we try moving tables around? No, the same server came back and told us that the tables we were moving were splitting up the server's sections.  Are you kidding me?!?!?   Then help us!!!  Just a quick, \"Hey guys, we have a few tables leaving and then we can accommodate you... can we get you drinks in the mean time?\"  Nothing!

Second time:  Three of is come in for drinks.  The other two have to use the restroom, I find a table in the bar area and sit... and wait...and wait.  Okay, maybe there's no servers, I go to bar and am immediately greeted by a nice, friendly bartender.  I sat back down and realized the server was too busy chatting with her friend a table away to be bothered with me.  My friends arrive back, and tell them to go to the bar because that is where I started the tab.  The same chatty server sees my friends ordering at the bar, and quickly walks over.  She asks them if they need a drink, and they tell her that we have tab at the bar.  She says,\" Yeah, but I am the server in this area... this is my section.\"  Huh??  Well then, honey, maybe you should stop flirting with men much too old for you and help your customers.  After we got our first round.. NO ONE came to clean off glasses.  I had to bring our dirty glasses to the and the bartender was very apologetic.

Unfortunately, Zipps is the ONLY sports bar in the area with ample TV's, so if you find yourself there... GO TO THE BAR!!!!


(UPDATE!!!!)  Have since been back and the servers seem to have gotten their act together.  All smiley and made me feel welcome.   So I gave them two more stars.... if it continues to be good I will eventually give the place 4 stars, but they gotta earn it.  This is real life and not every one gets a trophy at the end of the season!"}
{"text":"We always love this spot after work. Evwrytime we go we sit at the bar, and the bartender Matt takes great care of us. He made me an amazing german chocolate cake shot, which nobody ever seems to be able to make. The drinks are affirdable and the burgers are really good."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger, medium. Burger came out average. No major complaints. Server forgot condiments. Not a big issue.  My wife, however, ordered a chicken club. Patty came out black. Not dark brown, black. Burnt. Inedible. She sent it back.

10 minutes later, new sandwich came out. This one was slightly less burnt, but still inedible. Tasted sour, almost as if the oil in the fryer was never changed. Manager came out and explained that because the patty is thick, it requires a longer time in the fryer. And also their breading is dark before they cook the patty. I explained that I've had frozen patties that never burn or change color that taste BETTER than this lump of coal they brought out, claiming to be fresh.

The manager only issued a sarcastic apology and took the chicken off the bill. Unless the quality improves,  we won't be eating here anytime soon, which is a shame, because I used to eat here 2-3 times per week."}
{"text":"Meh. It's Zipps. In Ahwatukee. Used to have crappy service that seems better these days. Great specials except for peak hours."}
{"text":"We have been to zipps many times before. Went for weekend hangover specials at 1:30pm. Service was extremely slow, took 45 min to get our burger and fries.. Fries were under done. Burgers were dry.  Had to ask for napkins, knife and fork. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I purchased wings to go from this place and I've never had a more Burnt inedible chicken wings in my life. I have been to zips on 64th St. many times and the wings are fantastic. I went to this place, got two orders to go and both orders were inedible. The fact this was to go and went through multiple hands and multiple people looked at this and said \"fuck him lets serve it anyways\". Says a lot about the poor quality management of the zipps restaurant."}
{"text":"Not to judge the kids working there..but not their fault that whomever manages them they were scattered and we waited, finally waved them down for water drinks and our simple order when we watched two other tables served that arrived after us we announced we were leaving..the bar guy tracked us down at a nearby restaurant and demanded we pay for the couple drinks we had. Twenty bucks is a small price to pay to pay in hopes this place gets it"}
{"text":"I love Zipps, they have a great happy hour. Must tries: any of their focaccias, a ziparita, the cookie skillet and 32 ounce cold bud light. Great for meeting friends or watching the game."}
{"text":"Awesome place to watch the Cowboys game. Chicken tenders too bland, no flavor. But liked the fresh tempura batter. Just need more flavor."}
{"text":"Well like most Zipps, this place is filled with ex cops or wantabe jocks wannabes...its  Basically a place where testosterone comes to dry up and man boobs come to form...  There is a token drunken Irish loudmouth with his laugh \"HA HA HAHA!\" that will taunt your ability not to punch him in the face... The women are Alaska size or leathered up past their prime..  but the staff are great!   .... yes great service :-) beer is cold! And the wings are perfect for my man boobs :-)      enjoy :-)"}
{"text":"Nice bar. Bartender's are absolutely great. Food is average at best. CJ Talley's Pub across the street and Phoenix City Grill puts food at Zipps' to shame. Nice atmosphere until the noise kicks up around 4pm. Nice to have it in the neighborhood though."}
{"text":"Terrible.  This is a true story.  I go to Zipps to meet up with my husband and our friend who are partaking the waitress finally comes over I ask her what is in her Zipps-a-Rita and she said, \"We pour it out of the frozen machine, then if you want to add extra alcohol you can.\" Not my thing.  Instead I asked her if she had a lighter margarita with less sugar, I finally just ordered limes, club soda and tequila (a Nor Cal Margarita).  She looked at me and said, \"That's disgusting.\" No joke.

Dude - I don't want all the processed sugar that comes out of your shitty frozen drink! And I shouldn't have to justify my drink order to the waitress.  Now when I get a light margarita at any other bar it comes in a 16 oz glass.  This came in a high ball glass. This was a drink not a mixed shot.  

She did come over and apologize, as I was leaving.  Looking around at the time I was there it was filled mostly with people over 50, the bar was 75% men.

My husband and his friend were over charged for their burgers but they did not complain because they got good prices on their beers.  I am sure that soon the novelty will be gone and they will raise a stink about being over charged on food.

Bottom line - if you want to hang out with old men and bitchy waitresses, Zipps is your place, but its not for me."}
{"text":"Good bar food restaurant with a very reasonable prices.  Fast service and good number of TVs for sports watching. Great sandwich selection and can't beat the beer pitcher prices.  They update the menu frequently so won't get boring."}
{"text":"I love this bar! laid back.. but busy some times! moving a few miles from the place but uber n lyfting will always bring me back to the beautiful staff here"}
{"text":"Nice spot to watch sports I  live in Orange County and I gotta comes to zipps every time I come to Gilbert"}
{"text":"Been coming here for seeeeveral years. This place has been and, I am assuming, always will be hit or miss for me. Some days the food is fantastic and customer service is great. Others, one or both (food/customer service) is off. No rhyme or reason to be found. When customer service is off it is REALLY off. Levels of odd behavior and ignorance can be at all time highs. When food is off its usually along the lines of made incorrectly or something we order never showed up...but it made it to our bill. With that said, on their good days the place is a blast, food delicious and drinks are A+!!! Customer service is 100% and I'm more than happy. Just wish it was like that every time."}
{"text":"I had a great 4 hours at the bar. Had a few drinks with a friend. Ordered my 5th beer and the manager Shawn or Sean, delivered my drink telling me this will be my last. I was quiet, no signs of being drunk. I told him I'll take my check and leave. The bartender acted like he had no idea why I didn't want the drink but when I asked further he said it was policy. He could have told me policy, not go and grab the manager to tell me."}
{"text":"Delicious food. For some reason the beer just taste better here. And the bartender named Katie is AMAZBALLS and has a great rack."}
{"text":"Amanda is an amazing waitress.  She was really helpful and friendly.   The pizza was great and the atmosphere was electric.  The fries were great too. We will be back."}
{"text":"Didn't even have a chance to try! We were a group of 12 and you'd think they'd want our business. We were not greeted nicely and seemed frustrated that we were a large group and wanted to sit together. They were not even busy! We went to Whiskey Rose...so glad we did!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for years, and while I sometimes enjoy my visits here I have to give it 3 stars. The service is unexceptionally slow you don't feel like a priority as a customer. The food is really a hit or miss, some days it's good and others it tastes greasy and fake, like someone had just microwaved it in the kitchen. Atmosphere is okay unless you come here for football on Sunday, then you will just be surrounded by drunken idiots... Not worth the drive OR time it takes to actually eat.

I will say their desserts are delicious, chocolate chip cookie skillet. Warm and melty chocolate chip under a thick scoop of vanilla ice cream is to die for!"}
{"text":"We take our family here nearly every week. The food here is great, and the prices are very reasonable. Our favorites include the Buffalo Chicken focaccia (as someone else has mentioned, this is really a thick-breaded wrap), the burgers, the onion rings, and the fries. The best item on the menu, though, is the fried cheese stick appetizer. They wrap the cheese in what appears to be wanton skins and fry them up - amazing.

As sports bars go, this isn't the place to watch every detail of a big game. However, they have lots of tvs with a good variety of sports on - more of a diversion than the actual main event of the restaurant.

In all, this is our favorite local restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm a regular, been going to Zipps Gilbert since it opened in 2006. Really like the friendly staff, always good service. The wings and burgers are great, bartender's and Managers are friendly and fast.
My only complaint with Zipps is they keep raising their prices, used to be the best deal in town, now pretty much the same or even more than everyone else. I usually stop at least a few times a week for a couple beers and some wings, most likely spend $70 to $100 a week including tip. This opens new competition in the area with Buffalo Wild Wings, La Ristra, Kona Grill and House of Brews.
I will still stop, but not near as much, that is as long as they don't bump up the prices again"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today and a very small crowd was in the restaurant.  Figured I would get some decent service.  The service wasn't bad, just the speed was a bit below what I would expect with less than 20 people in the place.

After the longer than expected wait, I hoped to have a good meal.  The Mushroom Swiss Burger was very dry and lacked in any real flavor.  Made me think that this was probably a frozen/pre-made patty.

My wife had the chicken fingers/crispers/whatevers, and they too were very bland and lacked real flavor.  I never expect to put salt on anything in a restaurant as they typically are very high in sodium anyway but I think that Zipps could have used a little zip of salt on their entrees today.  I hope this isn't a regular occurrence there.

I MAY give Zipp's one more chance and try something different, but the hamburger and chicken fingers will not be in my radar."}
{"text":"Oh Zipps how I love thee...

Not sure what people's gripes are all about. Perhaps they're a bit uptight and feel more important than others or feel that they're the only customer in the place...

 I have been coming here for about a year and I love it here. I usually sit up at the bar, and the Zipps Girls are always on point.

 @NikkiO.- you're just plain rude. 

Everyone here is incredibly nice. Christy, Ashley, Genevieve, and Lizzy are the best! These girls are friendly and are always attentive. 

Maybe it's just me but I'm patient when it's busy especially during football. I come here for the great service and being greeted with a smile.

The food is excellent as well. It's NOT the servers fault if the food comes out wrong. MISTAKES HAPPEN! To err is human. Have a heart, jeez.

Folks, if you like a great atmosphere with great prices, bring your kids... or just yourself, and come to Zipps and hang out for a bit. You will love it!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Zipps I have ever been to. I have given it more than enough chances to change my mind but the service seems to get slower with every visit. I generally really enjoy Zipps but this location SUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"OMG where do I start. Our server was Shayna and she was a complete %itch. She acted like she was to good for us number one. We waited forever for her to take our order and then she gave us the wrong items. I can not stress how long we waited for this girl to take our order. Food was okay and management did their best to fix but the service in this place sucks!!!"}
{"text":"We've gone here several times in the past couple of months, usually around 8:00 on Sunday evening.

I'm not sure if it's because of the day and time but they are typically understaffed, service is slow and the food is poor.  The burger I had last night tasted like it had been under a heat lamp for a while, along with the onion rings.

My wife's cup of chili was supposed to be \"spicy\", but was neither spicy nor hot, as in temperature.  Her fries also seemed to suffer from being scraped from the bottom of the pile.

Next is the noise.  I know its a sports bar and it's going to get noisy, but why play loud rock music on top of that?  We couldn't hear ourselves think and when we asked for the music to be turned down they did it, but only for about five minutes.  There were about six couples at tables, and another dozen or so at the bar, and nobody was watching the games or, it seemed, listening to the music.  

Lastly, no Wi-Fi.  What's up with that?  I asked and they said it's because they don't want people \"camping out\".  People camp out in a sports bar?  Really?

Gave this place several chances but likely won't be back."}
{"text":"I was referred by a co-worker. He said get the golden wings, so I did! They are fabulous. The best wings I've ever had. I also get the French fries, which are ok. It does take a little bit of time for the wings to come out, but overall the service is very good. I will go back."}
{"text":"Terrible excuse for a sports bar. The teenage girls as you walk in were quite rude, the restaurant policy on sitting patrons at 11:00am on a Sunday is ridiculous. The restaurant is almost empty but they cannot seat us until everyone in our party arrives. Even worse, all the TVs are small, like 44in. Will never set foot in there again. Went to Twin Peaks, much better!!"}
{"text":"The servers were nice though the manager lacked customer service skills. They provide a kids menu and crayons though did not seem kid friendly. That is what I get for bringing my two daughters to an after work gathering on mill ave."}
{"text":"I ordered golden medium wings with a side of extra hot on recommendation.  The wings I received were among the best tasting I've ever had.  The blue cheese dressing had a generous sprinkle of blue cheese on top.  Nine of the ten wings were fried to perfection.  I'm a fire-eater and the extra hot was still well below my threshold so I'm sure the milder varieties will appeal to the mainstream.

I was the only person sitting outside, which I'm sure is a pain for the server, but the service was still very good and I was checked on frequently but not annoyingly often.  

The price was a little steep:  $21 for 10 standard-sized wings, a large Blue Moon, and a small Blue moon but that's not prohibitive for me given the excellent wings.

If my next plate of wings lives up to this one, I'll be dining here often."}
{"text":"Man,  we used to loved this place.  But over the past 6 months the food has become nearly in edible.  We have complained and told management, but they don't seem to have the ability to make necessary changes.  I hope that management get empowered to make the needed changes soon or this place will be another vacant building here in north Scottsdale az."}
{"text":"Brown guacamole bad BBQ sauce .........reported to server didn't care...said BBQ sauce was made In House came back said it wasn't (servers dont wear name tags?) zipps we've given you years and a lot or money...make it right or we will say goodbye........"}
{"text":"Not a fan.  Many of our friends love this place but I find the food and service to be mediocre at best and given the option I think there are better options."}
{"text":"Zipps - I'll change the rating to something much better when you fix what you did to the menu! 1) The ground beef was the best in the city. Awesome on the nachos, tacos, etc. You replaced it with shredded beef? Ugh. And you're charging $3 for the shredded beef? 2) Why are you now charging for tomatoes, olives, and jalapenos on the nachos? Aren't those standard nacho toppings? 3) What's up with the huge price hike? The price of the nachos for one has just about doubled! 

I typically love this place, but I can't come back - you ruined my favorite dish, and really, with the new prices, I might as well go to a higher-end sports bar/brewpub - same pricing there."}
{"text":"Sometimes that food is good, sometimes its not...make up your mind Zipps!"}
{"text":"First time here, it took 50 min to get our food for 3 people. The burgers are tiny, tiny enough to be fast food equivalent, however fast wasn't what we got. Our advice, Don't go on a game night, the service and care for their customers really slips."}
{"text":"It's your typical sports bar. Good service and prices. Pretty decent happy hour. Zipparitas (Zipps margaritas) are the best, and for only $3 (on happy hour)??!! Can't beat it. Cheese quasadilla and mozzarella sticks are pretty good. 

Careful though, this center is ridiculous.. The buildings blend in with the landscape and if you don't go in a certain entrance you can drive around for awhile trying to find it."}
{"text":"I come to the Greenway Zipps all of the time and I am not quite sure why I haven't written a review yet! They have the best prices and always have something great on special. Nikki, Kara, and Webb always take such great care of me whenever I go! I have been to quite a few of the other locations, but the Greenway location is by far the best!"}
{"text":"Very good happy hour prices on food and drink. Best food value is the chicken breast skewers.. 12 big pieces for six bucks. Best drink value are well drinks at three bucks a glass. 

For some reason the pizza slices during HH are no bueno - crust was like a thick cracker.
The other Zipp's locations have better quality pizza. 

Wait staff are courteous and attentive - just not all that personable, but that's cool.. I'm here to eat and drink!

Great neighborhood place that I'd recommend trying out.. You may even become a regular!"}
{"text":"Gross!  My husband and I popped in for lunch during the week.  The onion rings were salted.  Eww who does that?  The pizza crust crumbled in my mouth like a dry sand.  His sandwich was just as bad.  When I told the waitress I wasn't happy with the food, she stomped off like I insulted her.  It wasn't her fault and she had to reason to get mad.  Not impressed on any front."}
{"text":"I have to leave one star. If I could I would leave zero. We have been waiting for 20 minutes for a server to come to our table. No one has acknowledged us, given us menus, brought us drinks... nothing. We chose to sit outside because the host told us there was a wait but didn't know how long of a wait it would be. She told us we could sit outside and would be served by either Jaime or Bryan. Well no one has come out still while I took 5 minutes to write this review. Will not be returning if this is how you treat your customers. There are 2 other tables with people waiting just like us outside. Either need new staff or more staff."}
{"text":"I am absolutely disgusted with the management at this Zipps location.
My husband and I were meeting some of his colleagues and their families for dinner tonight at 4:00. We brought along our 6 month old, and were sitting right at the front door. Some of our friends are pool sharks, and had a table near the pool tables. The waitress warned me as I ordered a drink that the manager was going to tell us we couldn't have our son with us. Our son that was sitting ON MY LAP. She said she was going to check with him, and came back to inform me we couldn't be there. I am so angry with the ridiculousness of the situation - this manager is the worst I've ever seen. We were simply there to have a bite to eat, with no interest in going anywhere near the bar or pool tables. This Zipps location along with all others definitely just lost our business, as well as friends of ours with children. This is no way to run a business, especially when the manager doesn't have the balls to talk to customers and sends his 16 year old waitresses to be his messengers."}
{"text":"The dessert was prefect and fast. Didn't have to wait for 20 mins for our cookie ice cream. 
The wings could improve and the balcony's table needs to be clean after each guests leaves!"}
{"text":"Zipps, especially this location is one of my favorite spots in Phoenix. They have great happy hour and reverse happy hour (7pm-8pm is the only hour there are no specials, so beware). Food is typically great and the few times we've had issue the management team is always very quick to respond. Their wings are the BEST in the city, chicken chili egg rolls are delicious and the focaccia's are to die for. Also, they make their own Ranch dressing and it's A-MAZING! Great place to watch a game or 2. They do get super crowded though so go early if you're wanting a table right away. Finish your meal off with a skillet cookie or brownie. YUM!"}
{"text":"Went for Sunday football and there were tons of TVs to choose from.  The drinks were on sale but there was no sale on the food which is why I only gave it 3 stars.  I had the chicken skewers and they were delicious.  The waitress was friendly and the service was good.  The atmosphere was crazy and loud but that is what is to be expected of a sports bar on a sunday in October.  We will return but only for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Love this place to watch the famous Denver Broncos. Quite a few Broncos fans go here... awesome environment & good food. Me and my family enjoy this place a home away from home!"}
{"text":"Zips is great if you don't know what you want to eat, they have a lot of variety.  They have a number of TV's for keeping up on your sports.  We always find it a good value ."}
{"text":"Food was ok... But my French fries were really limp. The service was ok nothing special the place was pretty empty. Don't think I would go back for the food it was nothing special."}
{"text":"Extra crispy golden medium wings. Enough said! Great service and awesome food! Love the environment and appreciate the accommodations they make to ensure everyone can watch their football games comfortably!"}
{"text":"Good food!  Went during the super bowl and had a blast!  Good service too."}
{"text":"Lol I just got off work from another local bar, I ordered food to go and philly rolls while I waited. They came out cold inside so I just asked for them to be redone and this is what I got. Mind you they're supposed to be like egg rolls but philly style, peppers, beef etc all rolled up. Such a joke."}
{"text":"The food is Good that's all... 
The place was not as busy for a Sunday Night Football night. 
Our Food took very long to be served at our table. I saw the food just there ready for over 10min. Some of the waitresses were just chatting standings around not doing much. 
Our food was taken to the bar for God knows what and we had to ask what was taking so long after 20min passed. 
My fries where cold kinda cold. 
The burger was still kind of warm. It was good. The wings are very good. 
But I wouldn't go back to the place. 
I rather go to the one on Indianschool n 23rd st.
Just the waitresses need to be more attentive with customers and aware of their tables. Not getting distracted.."}
{"text":"Came on Sunday to watch football. This place is great so not sure why the low Yelp rating. The bartenders are so awesome. They have great Sunday specials and food is really good. Bar eats done quite well. See you next Sunday!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this Zipps for years but they only have 2 good servers. I went tonight and got a unknown server and she was horrible. Ate an appetizer on napkins and had to ask for utensils and napkins. Came by maybe once every 30 mins which is horrible it wasnt busy. There is too much competition in the area for hiring people who have no clue about customer service. I won't go back after too many chances with this place."}
{"text":"My server, Mariah, was on point. Girl was witty, speedy, and even helped me find a drink that I'd like (Not a big drinker normally). Definitely coming back because of her! You rock girl!"}
{"text":"Uhm....... Simply put, the food is not good. We started off with chips and dip and there was absolutely no taste in the chips or the dip. My server didn't ask me how I wanted my burger cooked and when I asked her about it later she said they typically make it medium. That was fine but my meat was well done..... The fries were greasy and limp..... And let me not even get started on the \"sweet potato chips\"..... Burnt and tasteless. My beer was also warm... Just Find another bar!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite sports bar anywhere.  The layout and screen placements are great for viewing your favorite team.  Drinks are a good value at full price and there are lots of different food and drink specials depending on the day and time you are there.  Food is very good for a sports bar.  Fish Tacos and pizza are my favorites."}
{"text":"Service was really poor and the food was uneventful. Fries are overly greasy, and my soup tasted like salsa heated up with chicken added."}
{"text":"Best burger in AZ!!! I love this frickin place. The golden wings are bomb too. I may be partial, as I grew up in the area, but damn I love this place. And the $2.50 steins are a great deal too. I highly recommend the green chili burger w/ half fries / half onion rings. Great for a quick bite and great for a group that wants to hang out for a while."}
{"text":"A group of six of us went here for lunch today we all had the wings Gold style they were excellent price was affordable would recommend eating here at least for lunch. Menu is a basic bar menu wings burgers things like that"}
{"text":"Ordered the Greek salad.  Iceberg lettuce and a couple of toppings. Bad deal management couldn't resolove. They should do the salad right or take it off the menu.

Only reason two stars is that other people in the party liked the burgers.

I had a really bad experience."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. We waited at least a hour and half for our takeout.... in conclusion we got ice cold food and when we approached the manager he walked away. Hmmm. This place deserves no stars."}
{"text":"I don't expect a sports bar to have gourmet food but Zipps is not good - it doesn't surprise me that most of the recent reviews are negative.   We ordered Fish and Chips -- the menu says  \"Pacific cod beer battered and deep fried\".   What we got was some weird thin fish, maybe catfish, that was disgusting.   The waitress assured us their fish and chips all look like this - except anyone who has had fish and chips at just about anywhere else would disagree.   A pacific cod is about 3 feet long and the fillets (except at Zipps) are flaky and delicious.  Anyway, whatever species the fish started out as was cooked badly and tasted worse.   The french fries with the fish were tasteless, which I guess is a step up from the fish.    We will not be back."}
{"text":"Frankly, I would give zero starts if possible... Our waitress forgot to put our food order in, our order was not put in until after 50 minutes and after we asked the status. When our food did arrive it was cold. We complained but were only offered Zipps \"bucks\". When we asked for a manager, Hakon never came over until we sought him out, literally walking around the restaurant looking for him. He only offered to cover the food we did not eat. After waiting over an hour I was starving and at the appetizer we ordered. He also indicated that corporate has stick rules and prevents them from comping the food. I am confused how corporate would know this, but ok... It really doesn't come down to the comp, it comes down to waiting over an hour, due to the waitress forgetting to put our order in and then they only offered 15.00 Zipps bucks for 5 people, so we can each have $3.00....."}
{"text":"I love this place, been here twice for drinks with friends and had a really good time, the inside is very well decorated and feels just like a bar. Definitely worth to try!"}
{"text":"Service is friendly and good. Food quality is typical bar food except their fries rock. Good place to watch a game with friends."}
{"text":"Horrible service rude manager and servers me and my friends go here all the time and honestly don't know why it's close to home and cheap but we will no longer be going there anymore the assistant manager and servers are rude I've only had one girl that I've liked there and she is no longer there she has moved to flagstaff she was honestly the only thing that kept us going after a dilemma I had with them they lost a customer for sure they don't care about customers here at all especially when trying to voice your opinion or making a complaint you can tell they just don't care they brush it off and it makes the wrist customer experience ever I wouldn't even give it one star they suck"}
{"text":"Well I have been a loyal Zipps customer since 2008 when I moved to the valley from Michigan and let me tell you, this was by far and away the worst experience I have had in a bar since I moved.  To begin with, our waitress delivered my beer and said that it was the last Coors Light, when I asked her if I could get a full beer she told me that the 32oz draft is sold in a 34oz mug so the solid 2.5 inches of space between the top of the beer and the glass was the 2oz difference.  I told her that was unacceptable and that I would rather have something else, instead of discussing the matter with me she simply walked away and ignored me as I tried to inform her of my new beer choice.  I grabbed a manager, she took away the beer but didn't seem to care that her server was just rude to me.  Seconds later a new waitress stopped by to introduce herself, and we were happy to have a new, polite, server.  As I was still upset about being disrespected I elected not to order anything and I kindly told the server that it wasn't her fault but that I wouldn't be eating despite the other 4 people in our group ordering dinner.

My wife ordered the chicken tenders.  She only had one bite before she told me to eat some because she didn't like them.  I took one bite and literally chewed through an entire tendon.  I spit out half the bite out, choked down the rest, and thought, well let's try another tender and see if it's any better.  I took a small bite and guess what, I felt as though I was chewing through a raw chicken tendon.  The single most disgusting thing that I have ever tasted.  We didn't complain because it just simply wasn't worth it.  We tipped our server 40% (3$ on a 7.50$ meal) because it wasn't her fault and left once everyone was ready.  

I will never patronize this Zipps location ever again.  If a friend wants to buy my beers I may return, but I will never spend another single dollar of my hard earned money to be disrespected.  Other Zipps locations may still get my business in the future, however, this location is by far the worst I have ever been to.  I have been to about 5 other locations, so I know a thing or two about the franchise."}
{"text":"A standby for lunch, a co-worker often referred to visiting Zipps as \"getting your oil changed.\"  This is not the place you come to for healthy food, but they have a great bacon cheeseburger and their wings are quite good.  

The staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. I hear friends talking about Zipps a lot so I figured I might as well try it. After waiting approx. 30 mins for a table for 6, we placed our orders the first time our server came by the table. When the food finally came they got 2 orders wrong. One of my guests ordered extra hot wings and received hot and my son ordered onion rings with his food and got fries instead. I don't mind an occasional slip up but after waiting 30 mins just to get a table on a Thursday evening and to get multiple orders incorrect I was understandably upset. Needless to say I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Was eager to stop in see what the buzz was since it just opened, not sure how well this place will do other than just a bar seen, usually you lower food standards when going to more of a bar place like this, so I did, but even then not so good! I prefer CKs on chandler thier food is much better."}
{"text":"I really like bar food, almost too much, and it's something I probably need help with. I can mostly thank some great spots in my home town, but locally, Zipps can be blamed for my progression.

Their burgers are consistently hot and flavorful, and the focaccias for the most part are good...even if they're just wraps. But in my book, their wings are my favorite in town. More specifically the golden medium wings have tremendous spicy/sweet balance. And their happy hour specials are some of the best deals anywhere. Anywhere!!!"}
{"text":"Too bad about the recent price hikes and revised menus. We used to go to Zipps every single weekend and loved it. Now we can't afford to do that. Our bill went up 25%. Less frequent business or loss of business due to disgruntled, once-loyal customers exploring other dining options is not a good strategy to protect the bottom line. I see many other restaurants offering MORE deals in an effort to drive customer traffic. Raising prices and reducing happy hour menus is not a good way to keep butts in seats. Good luck, Zipps. We'll miss you. 

Update - down to two stars. Went in for lunch with my wife today. Check out this photo. That's a $7.00 House Salad - listed on their menu under salads - not \"sides\". I'm guessing there was 30 cents worth of food in that bowl and that's mainly allocated to the 1/2 cup of ranch dressing poured on this thing. How embarrassing for them, and what a rip-off. No wonder the place was empty. Zipps needs to call Gordon Ramsay..."}
{"text":"I really really like this place. Love the wings, love the green chile burger, bacon burger and salads. Good beer and great kid's menu (even if the pizza has gotten very small) -did I mention the fries? They actually look like they come from a potato! I love working out at LifeTime and then destroying all the good I did by eating and drinking here. Good place for kids but can get insanely busy on Friday nights or during key games. 

Why no 5th star? The service can be sketchy. But they apologize and try to make it up to you."}
{"text":"Service wasn't all that great sometimes sitting yourself you maybe forgotten. It was just my daughter and I with an order off the menu and kids menu a table of 6 teenagers who sat minutes after us got there orders for six people before a table of two with kids menu item. I saw my items sit at the window and bypassed several times before be delivered  to the table. I've gotten better service at the other Scottsdale locations"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick drink and stayed for awhile and some food solely because of the lovely bartender Jackie (not sure of spelling).

Love Zipps, the food, atmosphere, and service are always stellar. Jackie just added to an already awesome experience.

 Highly recommend Zipps."}
{"text":"My experience here was dreadful. Hoping to get something small, I ordered the fish tacos with a side of onion rings. The \"fish tacos\" turned out to be a giant fish burrito wrapped in a completely stale and weird-tasting tortilla. And the onion rings tasted like they were left out overnight and re-warmed in the microwave. They were completely hard and chewy. Not to mention the staff all looked like, and acted like, they absolutely hated their jobs."}
{"text":"Zipps food and service has really gone downhill.  It's now off my list for carry-out orders.

My wife and I have frequent evening rehearsals and it's convenient to pick up food from Zipps on the way home, which we've done frequently.  But lately both the quality and delivery of the food has been below par and we'll be going elsewhere.

I like it that I can get a side salad with a burger, but the recent change in lettuce mix to VERY large-cut Romaine with a few other items is not acceptable.  The big leaves make it look like a decent amount, but there's actually considerably less salad, with less flavor, than the previous iceberg-based mix. 

Not putting on-the-side dressing in the to-go bag or box is inexcusable.  But last night's order was missing not only salad dressing on two orders, but there was no side of chili on my green chili burger.  Missing dressing has happened before, but come on!  This is just shoddy performance by the staff -- and to think, we had tipped them before getting home to find their screw-up.  (I guess the solution is to open the tied-up takeout bag and check EVERY item in your order to be sure it's there. I don't want to have to do this.)

Bottom line: You're off the list, Zipps.  Let us know when you start giving a damn and we may come back."}
{"text":"Zipps....shitty wings, good looking servers. You can't win them all...next time I'll just have to go to native for wings they never fail you."}
{"text":"Love this spot great drinx! Great wings! TV's  everywhere, clean, friendly staff! Coming back for sure :-P"}
{"text":"great food and excellent service 
will be back for sure always a great spot to watch sports"}
{"text":"Where to begin. Well, on weeknights there is only ONE hour between Happy Hour and Reverse Happy Hour. I like to call this time \"Unhappy Hour\". 

I had only been here once before I moved into the apartments next door and that first experience was less-than-stellar. They had just opened this location and clearly the cook had just flunked jr high Home Ec class. After moving nearer, I figured it deserved another try, if only to enjoy a beer within walking distance.

I have been pleasantly surprised. My favorite part is that they have pretty good wings in addition to the cheap beer at all times but \"Unhappy Hour\". I am not sure if I should be ashamed or proud that every staff member here knows my name and/or my exact order. 


I come here often to shoot pool and have met quite a few other regulars. We all have a pretty good time. It's laid back and affordable AND I can walk (sometimes stumble) home."}
{"text":"Its everything you want a sports bar to be and about 35% of what you'd want your restaurant to be. Food is 3/10. TVs, Beers, and atmosphere (especially in Tempe) is closer to an 8/10 (especially if there is a big game)"}
{"text":"Horrible!! The manager just told us they don't take visa gift cards!! Seriously!? Don't come here!! Do not recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We recently went to Zipps as we love their wings. We arrived at 645 p.m. for wings and it happened to be happy hour. We never received our order until 745 p.m. and I asked for the extra hot sauce to be on the side and that it be heated. We we received the wings, one hour after ordering, the sauce was cold, another hot sauce was not delivered to another guest, our 2 orders of half fries and rings, 1 was delivered and the 2nd order was wrong which took 20 minutes to get right. My extra hot sauce took 20 minutes to get delivered and the manager told us that they normally don't heat the sauce...WHAT?? This quick meal of 4 orders of wings and 2 baskets of half fries/rings took 2 hours. The manager agreed he would happy hour all our drinks, this never happened. We felt like form the restaurants point of view it was no big deal. Our bill was $100 as we kept ordering drinks waiting for our food. They did offer us $10 for our next visit...REALLY!! Sad to say after 10 years going to this establishment we will not be returning. Our last 3 visits have been bad, but this was the worst experience I have ever had. The last time I went I asked for the sauce to be heated and when it arrived, delived by a manager, it was cold, when asked it to be heated I was told they normally would but they were to busy, I guess they are not in the business of customer service...wait they are but don't practice it!! The servers are always nice, it seems to be a kitchen issue most of the time. I hate to say it but I will be telling everyone in our neighborhood about my recent experiences. I prefer to give my money to an establishment that cares about the customer and shows it!!"}
{"text":"With so many places to eat in downtown Tempe we lucked out and chose Zipps. It had a great sports bar atmosphere. We had a choice of dining inside or outside. We choose outside. Our servers name was Sabrina and she was awesome. My son and I chose the bacon cheeseburgers for our dinners. The 2 patty burgers more than filled us up. I was completely satisfied with the food and the service. Next time we are in Arizona we will be sure to come back."}
{"text":"Awesome sports bar and great beer and nice staff. If the peeps from Alaska ever come to Cali look me up."}
{"text":"We are regulars here. When it's busy, the beer is always cold, and the meals are always hot!


   It's generally a great place for a group hangout and the atmosphere is casual and fun! Whether you are out to have drinks or dinner.

Note: the food is much hotter and the beer is colder when they are busier, so go during a Friday night or a college game!: Just be sure to come here on a busy night!"}
{"text":"I go here all the time and never get bad food. The two best things on the menu for me are the wings (definitely GOLDEN) and the focaccias!"}
{"text":"Great spot.  Friendly bar service, great place to watch baseball or football games.  Pepperoni pizza was amazingly fresh and tasted delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm doing one star because I'm not allowed to do no stars. I normally don't go out of my way to write a review, but this was the worst experience. Went to zipps with a group of 10 people and  was told we couldn't split our check. I was here two weeks earlier with 15 people and they split the check just fine. Took 15 to get each beer we ordered and the server gave us attitude. Will never go here again. Back to the Gilbert location."}
{"text":"Should've read reviews...more like zero stars! 45 minutes to get our cold, incorrect orders.  Our waiter forgot or got wrong all of our table's orders. Our waiter appeared to be writing but perhaps a grocery list?  When asked why the long wait, Joshua A said other orders were before ours and kitchen was slammed- there was 1 other table with people in his section. We spoke to a manager who said....wait for it... Not I'm sorry, not how can I fix things, no.... guess what he said...go ahead....I swear I'm not lying... \"I'll review the camera footage\"  and guess what....he didn't return until we asked our waiter Joshua A to see if he could pull him off his Zips, FBI training. After determining the ball had been dropped(9 minutes to get the order to the kitchen) on actually being able to walk from our table to deliver the ticket- Facebook emergency, no doubt? I could go on and on but in closing..the word Zip implies peppy, fast, speedy service. I believe at this establishment it refers to what you do with your pants, before you bend over."}
{"text":"Walked in and was seated immediately. Sat down and ordered an appetizer of the BBQ skewers, they came out pretty quick. They weren't bad just a little over priced 10.25 for 12 little shrimps covered in BBQ sauce. So I ordered a chicken foccanio or however you say it ( I had never heard of this before coming here) it had chicken, cheese, bacon , and avocado and I got a side of onion rings. The onion rings tasted like they'd been sitting out for awhile and were hard and flavorless. The rest of my meal was ok just disappointed about the amount of avocado they put in it. But the waitress is really one of the reasons for the rating, she walked away while I was trying to ask her a question, we had to ask for Silver ware, napkins, boxes, bags, refills, etc... the fact that I had to ask two different waitresses for silverware and more napkins is a bit silly. Overall quality of food average and customer service was not that great"}
{"text":"The best place still to watch football is at home in front of our big screen, but this place is a nice diversion.  I love the golden wings, the greek salad, the french fries...I like Zipps.

Wings are good enough to discourage the husband and son from going to Native New Yorker, where the only real good thing on the New Yorker menu is the wings and very little else."}
{"text":"I have been going to zipps for many years, and overall it's very good. Sure it can be hit or miss on some items, but they consistently have very good wings, especially the honey golden. Tip:  if you like your wings a little crispier then make sure to ask the server that they are order that way, as ometimes they can be a bit undercooked, but they're still always very good. I also like their chicken focaccia sandwich. The onion rings are also wonderful most the time, but sometimes are a little bit limp and need to be sent back to be crisped up a bit. But overall I'm very happy with my experience at zipps, and I will likely continue to visit roughly once a week for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"I am updating my review. This place used to be pretty solid, decent food, not great, but worth the price. They have raised prices on some menu items 30% or more, ridiculous. They are no longer a decent value.  Too many other options where Ii can go for the same or less money. 

And yes, I know everyone has to raise prices, because of the new laws with minimum wage, and vacation time for part time employees. Your server went on a whole rant about the reason prices were raised. However you are the only place that raised items 30% or more, and I don't care if it's because you're \"overdue\" for an increase. Bottom line, your prices are now too high. In the end, if people boycott you, at the end if the day you'll end up making less. Greed never pays!

Oh and by the way they often serve their wings under cooked. It's happened a few times, where they are actually bloodly and jello-like texture!  So I sent them back, to clarify that we want them crispy. They actually have the nerve now to make a notation on their new overpriced menu that says you can order crispy wings, but if they are not to your liking, there are no refunds. WTF? 

Goodbye zipps. I will miss you, but not for long."}
{"text":"Nice layout. Good drinks.  Great service.  Food is ok depending on what you order.  No pinot grigio for the bride.  Good happy hours.  No verizon signal at all at bar.  Couldn't even download the yelp app - had to go to nellos to get signal."}
{"text":"Fish n chips were nasty... Can't believe the waitress actually brought them to the table.
EDIT: I should add that the waitress was polite and I ordered the Quesadilla instead... It was ok."}
{"text":"Come on in and get a heart attack. The worst food I've ever had, even for a sports bar. Don't let the TVs pull you in! But hey, it's a college area, and broke college students clearly don't care about taste. Usually you can count on fries to be good but not here. Everything else is covered in grease and salt, including the chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, and the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Not good at all.  The place is full of screaming little kids that run around the dining room with no parental supervision.  I just places like this that try to be all things for all people.  Video machines in one corner for the little kids and then a \"hangover cure\" menu in the bar.  Really?  The food is bar food- burgers, sandwiches and wings.  Kind of a collection of everything from all of the burger chain places- chili's, applebees etc.  Don't look for anything with any originality or flare.  My server bragged about how great Zipps is but the burger was no better than what you would get at Chili's.  Good beer prices though."}
{"text":"I've been going to Zipps since I moved to AZ in 2005 and it is by far one of the best sports bar / restaurants I've frequented. You cannot beat their daily happy hour and reverse happy hour deals. Best wings (recommend \"golden medium\") in town and I'm a huge fan of their focaccias (recommend the \"pepper jack\" or \"monaco\"). I wish the fries would be cooked a bit longer but you have to appreciate that they are freshly hand cut. I also used to always get their \"it's not easy being this cheesy\" burger (no longer in the menu but they'll still cook it). Also a big fan of both of their chilis. I always leave Zipps satisfied"}
{"text":"I love Zipps! Great sports bar with awesome food. Every day has a different nightly special, so there's always something unique on special every night. Make sure to try the mozzarella sticks and the chicken skewers!"}
{"text":"Im sorry that I brought 30 people into your bar. Your staff was unprofessional and rude. You are a shit bar. Go fuck yourself."}
{"text":"So far ive been to this gilbert location about 5 times. Every time ive been the food and service have been top of the line, even during a big NFC football game. Very impressed, keep up the good work Zips! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a quick bite and to catch the game which wasn't on sling.tv.  Had great service and probably one of the better chicken caesar salads I've ever had - and under $8.  Was looking for a good, casual neighborhood place to catch a game and I may have found it."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've had a Zipp's burger, so in I went for lunch.
It's as good as I remember..... unhinge your jaw and shove that burger in for that first big bite! I had the BBQ bacon burger with half fries, half onion rings.
Don't let your fries sit for too long, they lose their umph.
Jessica my server was attentive and nice. I recommend eating at the bar.
The wings smelled good from the guy near me.
I don't know if they were crispy or not.
They looked like excellent size!
ALWAYS order your wings \"wet\" for max flavor and enjoyment!
OK beer selection, nothing too out there. 
Had the Red Hook mild amber, it was perfect with the meal.
Update: That AWESOME beer hasn't been on for a few months. 12/2015

2 weeks later ---- ordered medium wings, crispy and wet. 
Got 10 wings.
PERFECT!
The SWEETmediums crispy and wet are the best!
I'll slurp that sauce off the paper when I'm done!

1 week after that -- ordered golden hot, crispy and wet.
I dredged each wing in the sauce before biting.
GREAT flavor with PAIN. Your lips touch a wing and OW!
Yeah that's what you get. Expect to sweat!
Otherwise perfect! I think I'll stick to medium.

INSIDE SKINNY:  Happy Hour is 3-7pm M-F.
Wings are $6 and there are other good deals too.

THE BAD: Don't pop in during your lunch hour unless you're super close or are prepared to get back late from lunch. I've always had to wait 20 mins. and they don't accept phone-ahead orders."}
{"text":"Fun!  Lively!  Great service!  Sports galore!   The best Happy Hours deals around!  Obviously a well-liked neighborhood hang-out, as the place was booming.  This is a great spot for date night.  One Zipparita and my troubles were gone!  Husband had a specialty burger and fries; I had the chicken tacos (asked for jalapenos and received, no charge)... both meals absolutely delicious.  Will be coming back and bringing friends."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are great, service sucks. I came here with a large group of coworkers to celebrate someone making a career move. This group has a bad habit of not making reservations, but they did this time and we got a great seatting arrangement in the very front of the restaurant where no one could miss us right when you walk in which was perfect as people would come a go throughout the hours that we were there.

When my husband and I arrived, we found seats and started being social. After about 15 minutes, we saw the waitress come by to bring the check for a couple of people (we were late because we were waiting out a flash food alert up in PV). We made eye contact and held the menu in our hands to indicate our interest in ordering. We weren't too hungry and we were having fun so we were patient and understanding that she might just be super busy at this moment. After doing that for about 20 minutes, happy hour was coming to an end and we wanted to throw in our order before that happened so we went up to the bar to order. They got pissy with us, but when we explained the 40 minute wait, they worked with us and told us to continue the order and cash out with her. 

Some time later, we were still having fun and I wanted another drink. I snapped out of my conversation and noticed that it had been an hour with not as much as a water refill so I started making direct eye contact with the waitress again and trying to speak with her when she would pass. When that didn't work I went back to the bartender so see if we could cash out there. He told us he would get her attention and a couple minutes later our bills were at the table without as much as a word from the waitress when she dropped it off. She did however take the time to write \"Thanks! \" on the bill. 

I will happily admit that I can't stand Mill or most of Tempe for that matter and I was already not happy to be treking down south to a college town, but I wanted to send my friend off right so I sucked it up, paid for parking, and was extra careful to watch out for student driving and homeless people. This rating doesn't just apply to the Tempe location. I went to the Scottsdale one in my part of town and didn't have this bad of experience, but the staff was slow and seemed to be bothered by our orders. 

The food is great though so I'll likely return and not put up a fuss next time someone wants to go here. I will however start being more honest with my tips since this is directly a wait staff problem. In summation, if you want amazing drinks, good food, and can put up with bad service come to Zipps and have a zipparita cause they are the best."}
{"text":"Pros: 
We like this bar.
The proximity to Lifetime Fitness is great. 
We try to go for happy hour at least once a month- a good value.
Love the wings, haven't tried any of the other food.

Cons:
Tap beer selection could be better.
It is a chain."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times now since it had opened. Good service on each visit but today we had GREAT SERVICE! Management was very observant and friendly. Server was amazing! I am so happy with the service that I could not wait to get home but am still at Zipps and had to review. Great job Zipps!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Arizona from Texas this weekend. We decided to hit up Zipps Saturday evening thinking it'd be the best place to catch both of our college football games (Texas A&M and ASU) since they have about a bajillion TVs. We sat at the bar for several hours, had several drinks each, buffalo wings, and a large pepperoni pizza. 

Pros: The food was pretty good. The wings were crisp but also extremely saucy. The pizza was fresh and hit the spot. Their margs were also pretty tasty. Most importantly, the TV situation here doesn't even kinda suck. There's a good size television every couple feet, which makes for optimal sports watching. And I'm not going to lie, I was pretty impressed when the 9 TVs merged into 1 giant screen when the ASU game started. I don't care who you are, that's cool! 

Cons: The service was less than acceptable. From our very first greeting, we were just appalled with the attitude of our bartender. She was extremely short with us, and just plain rude. And it didn't stop with her. Every bartender after her also had the same kind of unpleasant disposition. It's like one of them caught a severe and extremely contagious case of Resting B*tch Face and then infected the whole bunch. It got to a point where everyone around us was also talking about how they didn't appreciate the way they were being treated. 

Having lots of TVs is cool. Having decent food is also cool. But being treated with respect as a paying customer is the coolest. And in my opinion, it's the customer service that makes or breaks a place."}
{"text":"The WINGS WINGS WINGS! The honey golden wings are our go to. It's amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish they would make bottles of the sauce and sell it. Also, recently my in laws were in town and we needed pizza and wings. Of course we ordered from here but good lord who knew their pizza was REMARKABLE! I LOVE this place:-)"}
{"text":"Was going to meet my parents at this location on Sunday 2/12/17. We frequent the Chandler location and always have a great experience. Prior to us arriving my mom was hungry so she put in an order of  Fish. The waitress tells my mom they are going to charge $1.50 for a split charge. The split charge is for items on specials. They were not even going to split the item, the waitress just assumed since only one order was placed. My mom told her it was for her only and then the manager comes out to also tell my mom of the charge. My mother was so annoyed they cancelled the order and paid for the drinks ordered. Let's just say we ended up meeting some where else. #losttwofrequentguests"}
{"text":"Ordered the Fish & Chips...$8.50 for 3 tiny pieces of fish no bigger than a post-it note...really disappointing in size and flavor"}
{"text":"Steer clear of this place! Went to watch a sports event, was with a table of about 10 people, each with our own individual tabs. After everyone had left and paid for their tabs, me and my friend decided get ours. To our surprise one of the individuals had left without paying for their tab, so they added it to ours!! We paid for what we had consumed but refused to pay for someone else's tab due to the lack of the waitress keeping track of her clients. Manager was called and there was no help from him either, was threatened to call the police if we did not pay. Police showed up harassing us as well to pay up. I argued to them all as to why I should be stuck paying for someone's tab and have to pay for what we did not consume! To avoid further drama and humiliation we ended up paying the measly $20 tab. Very poorly and rudely managed. Horrible experience. Will never be returning to any Zipps in the valley. Lost a great client."}
{"text":"Went to Zippe this last weekend over Labor Day, to have the special that they were running on Mother Beer, as usual we sit down our waiter told us it was out of stock, this is the second time that this is happened, I would rate this Zipps very poor on service, and they have a I don't care attitude of take it or leave it.! Would not recommend this restaurant.

Thanks, Tiffany
No we did not stay at the Zippe's, like I said in my comment the staff had a I don't care attitude, and this is not the first time, the staff needs lots better training, someone needs a train them it's about the customer and not the staff. Customer care does not exist at this restaurant, other Zippe's seem to be much more customer friendly, and tries to take care of there customers needs."}
{"text":"I live across the street, and work in the same complex. I eat here weekly, at least once. 

Literally ALL their burgers are amazing. The Sweet Jalapeno is my favorite. You can get their KILLER onion rings, to die for french friends, or 1/2 and 1/2! Their Greenbay chili is really good. And their WINGS. The Honey Hot is my favorite. They have truly awesome Bleu Cheese Dressing (Even if you don't LIKE IT, Try it, You'll love it!). 

I usually get the Honey Balsamic salad for lunch, with candied walnuts, fresh goat cheese, cranberries, and a dressing that is out of this world yummy!

The beer on tap selection is pretty small, but it's got some good ones. And they have damn good bloody mary's! The bartenders and servers are always peaches!"}
{"text":"I was a regular when this place opened a few years ago but they moved all the staff to Tempe.  Since then they can't find good servers or management.  After tonight, I have given up on this place.  I'm not a huge fan of Phillies but I prefer their service over those clowns at Zipps!"}
{"text":"Zipps has gone so far downhill.  My favs were the chicken skewers and the pepperjack foccia but the foccia was half size and the skewers were about 1/3 the size... Good bye old HH hangout."}
{"text":"Tried the golden wings and pepper jack focaccia, both were very good, well portioned and well made. Not five stars though due to lunch took 1.5 hours and our bartender/bar waitress seemed to be overcome with tables and it took longer than expected to eat and get the bill paid and leave. I will definitely be here again for the golden wings and try the Philly spring rolls."}
{"text":"My recommendations:

Golden medium wings, Monaco Focaccia, and the half & half sides of onion rings/ fries.

They always run specials for happy hour and depending on the day they have specific plates on specials. 

You can go wrong with this sports bar. Between all the TV's, great food, and drink specials its a great place to watch your team play!"}
{"text":"Zipps is wonderful.... Food is excellent, everybody is friendly..... Charging a table of 4 $.50 for a side of ranch is stupid.  Making that extra fifty cents to make me feel taken advantage of is silly when we already have a tab of well over $100.  I love this place but this seems petty and makes me feel unimportant and not valued as a customer."}
{"text":"40 minutes since order and still no food. Two dozen plates sitting under hot lamps unattended. Absolutely ridiculous. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Ordered a Long Island and got charged $6 a piece. Saw the waitress bring back Coke and Lemonade. Sketch place looking for a quick buck."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar, loud, bar food, reasonable beer prices. Service has been good both times I have been. Bar food ugh. Go if you want a drink."}
{"text":"My first visit to this sports bar.  Food was good and overall a pleasant place with adequate TV screens and pleasing staff.  However, our server was either new, in a bad mood or just a poor server.  The place was pretty busy but the other tables were well serviced by the other servers.  Had to get assistance from others for utensils and also some missed food items.  Was surprised the server didn't know the daily soup (only one available).  No too happy being charged for the \"add-ons\" like down to a few extra onions and small plastic containers of mayo, dressings, etc.  Prices normally cover things, especially a few slices of an onion!  Will try it again but will be a little picky on who we get to serve us, maybe the one in Tempe.  Many other similar places close by that have been much better."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and waited 20 minutes to be seated. After about 15 minutes the server took our order then waited one hour, we gave up waiting and said goodbye"}
{"text":"I'm done visiting this location. I've been coming here for years, multiple times a year and it has steadily decreased in enjoyment. The last 2 occasions I have been here, my party waited over an hour for the food to be delivered. Both times the kitchen was \"really backed up\" and was offered nothing to compensate. The restaurant wasn't even that busy. Last visit, the waitress told us our food was going to take awhile longer, so I tried to order the chips and salsa that are on Happy Hour, but it was 7:01 pm and was told I had to pay full price. So, you understaffed the kitchen and are apologizing to customers and then you're not giving them a break? On top of that, the prices have steadily increased while the amount of food has gotten smaller. That's enough for me to say adios. There are plenty of other choices for this style of food so I'll be headed to those next time.

*Update: just look at the response. Makes the decision a lot easier. Customer lost"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend and each of us ordered burgers. I asked for medium rare and my friend asked for rare. Both burgers came out well. Disappointed. Sweet potato chips were good and the server was great, so we gave her a nice tip. Not her fault the kitchen failed."}
{"text":"We went here after the terrible balloon Halloween festival (please read my review on that) and it was a pleasant surprise. 

Although we had 10 kids with us were a little weary of bringing them to a sports bar. It turned out to be great. There were others in there with kids and the bar is just loud enough so you can't hear bratty kids screaming and the food was just to their liking. 

I had a mushroom burger and a Greek salad that was very good and my hubby had wings which he said were second to none. 

My only gripe is that we had to wait a little longer but to be honest that should be expected on a Saturday night when you come in with 14 people. 

Overall I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This Zipps seems more welcoming and open than the one in Old Town. The bar staff has always been much nicer and more attentive than other locations. The bar food came out fast and was acceptable."}
{"text":"i am totally not surprised this place gets low stars. the service is atrocious. 
i pushed my friends together and decided to drag them out on a tuesday night. they weren't too keen on the idea of grabbing a beer, but i convinced them

all three of us were out of town-ers. 
two from california, one from utah. 

the bartender told me that they didn't accept vertical ID's. I told her it was clearly a real ID (the new CA ID's are impossible to counterfeit). I had multiple credit cards, and even a medical insurance as well as car insurance  card to prove that I was indeed the person on the ID card. Bartender said no, I said let me speak to the manager. 

the manager took his time getting over to us, i watched him from behind the bar. i remember his name to be deshawn, but i could be wrong. 
i explained to him that i was from out of town, had my credit cards, my insurance card and my medical insurance card. it was clear I was sober and not looking to create a fuss, just was trying to have a beer. instead of making the manager decision that it was totally appropriate to serve me, he tells me he will need to \"call the hire ups\". AS IF I WANT TO WASTE ANYMORE TIME WAITING AROUND TO FIND OUT IF I WAS APPROVED. so i left. went to the nearest bar, next door had a great time there. the manager on duty who was also the bouncer informed me that he wasn't allowed to accept vertical ID's, but since i was clearly sober and very clearly the person on the ID that stated i was 2-fricking-3 years old, there would be no issue.

I had a wonderful time at the bar next door, i believe it was called the handle bar. don't waste your time with incompetent managers who can't make decisions for the facility themselves. please. that is your job, to manage and make decisions when your boss isn't around, not so you can take your time calling someone for a question you can clearly handle yourself. 


to the manager - i told you i would be writing a yelp review, and i think it's pretty atrocious that you don't seem to care about what people say publicly about your business. you could have been much more apathetic or apologetic, instead you made my friends and I upset and lost money."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Zipps in this community for over 6 years and ever since they have moved to the new location their service has gone downhill. I am so happy we had Paris as a server because she was on top of everything; she deserves 5 stars. 
As a former regular you will get the boot here and this review would be one star if it weren't for her. We actually had a couple bartenders and a manager scoot us out of a seat because they had priority here. I'm sorry but as much as I respect the amazing food and the old Zipps the staff just puts certain people in priority. 
I appreciate all the good times and people at the old location and was excited for them to move forward to the new place but they need to get their staffs attitudes in check because if this continues the Zipps  community will crumble again."}
{"text":"For the love of... DO NOT GO HERE! Have given this location and other Zipps location numerous attempts, it has always been consistent. Really hard to get a server to pay attention to you. Normally takes 30-45 minutes, when its slow, to place an order. Food is consistently servered luke warm, fries are over greesy, chicken is rubbery, mozzarella sticks are served in egg rolls.. Good luck getting them to bring you the bill, and have fun waiting around for them to get your payment and then give it back to you. Cocktails are weak and small. If any one chain were to be in desperate need of bar rescue, Zipps would be that chain."}
{"text":"The wings are good. HH specials are also good. Too loud. Also please note, Zipps likes to unnecessarily give you a straw with your water. PLEASE FOCUS ON THE FACT THE DESERT WILL BE UNINHABITABLE BY 2050, therefore, we need to treat our planet as the only one we have. If one person orders water, everyone else does not need a glass with a straw unless they ask for it. Do your part Zipps!"}
{"text":"Oct 2017 update: so sad that not much has changed.,Nice to see management responding trying to defend the place but if this many people are so unhappy that you are constantly on the defense explaining yourselves  then something is wrong. I want to love this place. Years ago Zipps was the nuts when it came to sports bars. You guys Need better service and improved food quality. I live within walking distance and would selfishly love it if you folks would be honest and seriously reinvented yourselves.! UP YOUR GAME! YOU CAN DO IT!! 


I'll keep this simple. Slightly better than average bar food but in an ear splitting setting. Wether it's music or sports, the volume is often set just too damn loud. 

Huge dining area, big bar area, LOTS of very nice TV's, great patio, diverse menu, including pizza and decent wings. Not quite sure why I don't love it more...but I don't. 

Worth a stop, just not at my top."}
{"text":"F@$K Zipps!  It's amazing how many people and companies are not in the customer service business!  You've had the same crappy beers on tap FOREVER .....wake up"}
{"text":"I love their Zipps golden wings. Their burgers are really good too. Also tried the nachos which were good too. I will be back"}
{"text":"Good burgers good wings and freshly made onion rings. Also tried the strawberry margarita. Overall impressed with the quality of bar food."}
{"text":"Hey today the Monday night of 9/1/14, the manager was wrong! I will give a lot more details of the situation that took place."}
{"text":"Terrible food and service.  French fries and onion rings so hard, could not eat. I went thinking perhaps there was an improvement.  Big mistake! 

Patsy Anderson"}
{"text":"We tried Zipps because it's close and I've had a good experience at other locations...unfortunately, after 2 attempts here the only consistency is bad food and bad service.   

On the first try, our waitress seemed to be having a rough day and then just disappeared...the manager (good ole' Kenny G. look a like) later said he didn't know what was going on but our new waitress shared our old one walked out and quit? So....we were understanding, but it was super slow service after that and a mess trying to get our bill.  We were offered coupons and told they couldn't discount our bill since we \"ate the food.\" Okay. 

Second trip back- we were hopeful! The service was really slow even though it wasn't busy, it took about 40 minutes for our nachos to come out and were average at best.  

We still have $10 in coupons, but honestly I don't think it's even worth going back for."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed to have to walk into this place tonight at about 5:15 on Sunday January 7th right through 4 people smoking right in front of the front door."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at all the bad reviews because I've never had a problem here regarding food, drinks, or service. Drinks are always consistently good, strong, and inexpensive. The bartenders are all really friendly along with the handful of servers that I've come across. As far as food goes, the medium wings and skewers are the best. I don't usually get too complicated with my salads but the house salad with chicken is pretty bomb. It's a casual easy-going type restaurant. Ideal place to relax and enjoy some wings and beer."}
{"text":"Review is on this Zipps location

I generally love Zipps.  Been to them ever since they opened the one on Camelback/Miller when I first moved here in 2001.  

I usually peruse the one on Gilbert/Warner, but wanted to give this one a shot.  It took forever to get a beer, and I was only checked on twice in an hour. 

Not saying I won't come back, because it seemed like it was a busy night and they were understaffed.  So, this easily can be remedied with an update.  

Just my two cents for now."}
{"text":"The last couple of times we have visited Arizona we have come here and they have been much better with their service. Their food is great, excellent prices for booze and food."}
{"text":"This is my first time at the Gilbert location, been to the Scottsdale locale many, many times. 

Tried the calamari for the first time, and and the chips and queso. Calamari was bombastic. I've had calamari many places, San Fran, New York, Vegas, & the flavors & spices on this are wonderful. The edamame is standard but comes w/a great ginger/soy sauce.

Very attentive service, although the bar could use some more variety in their flavored vodka. I asked about having special flavors ordered if I became a regular (that's what many bars in my area have done for me) and the bartender was pretty snide and said that wasn't usually done here. I should have asked a manager instead. 

Still excellent service and great food, will be back!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Zipps in Phoenix, it is such a cool place to eat at and the service here is great. And I love all of the different sporting events on the TV's here."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious,that staff here is very kind,and watching the ASU Football Coaches Show here is very fun and it is also great tohang out with fellow Sun Devil fans here"}
{"text":"We were there at 4, hungry and ready for dinner. Should have known we were in trouble when there were what appeared to only be 2 servers for the entire restaurant. After placing our order, we waited 30 minutes and our food had still not arrived. We flagged down our server and asked if food was coming. He let us know we were next and it should be right out. After a couple minutes, he returns and tells us he never entered in our order. 

At that point we walked out and drove through the Taco Bell drive through. Not at all a good substitute but after waiting all that time, we were not about to wait even more. 

It will be a long time before I return."}
{"text":"First, I love the food, I really do.  We come here quite a bit just for that and that is where it all ends.  First, the hostess refuses to sit you where you ask just because a server was sat in her section already. I am a server and there are times I get double or triple sat because that is what the customer wants.  We just let the customer know the server was sat and it may take a minute to get her to the table.  Then, they have only breakfast from 9 to 11 and on their breakfast and drink specials that say they start at 9, is a lie.  There are 2 items you can't get till after 11 am.  Now I know why I go to Top Golf for the early games because I can order off all the menu.  I didn't come to a bar to eat breakfast and I am tired of the service here.  I will just have to go back to getting take out to eat the food I do love so much.  So sad that management really doeesnt care about the customers, this place could care less if you are happy or not."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Waitress had no smile, was rude, unresponsive, and very slow. Never came back to check on order. Beer was warm, I told waitress, and she took it back, repaired the warm beer into a chilled glass, and brought it back half full. As I said, beer was warm, food was cold, and service was terrible. I left her a single penny for her tip, and she was not even worth that!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my husband and I's go-to place for a great burger everytime. Also our favorite place to be during football season. Lots of tv's and a great staff. Love this joint!"}
{"text":"This place sucks omg the Service is so slow food comes out cold as ice I will never eat here again"}
{"text":"Have been the zips a few  Times for their amazing wings golden hot is my favorite Came here for lunch with a friend it was not very busy the server took forever to get to ice forever to get drinks and a order took a while to come out so lunch took an hour and 20 minutes from the time we sat there to a time we left very unacceptable To me this was all the servers fault Just not on top of things Love to you Now for the food I ordered the Greek salad what does not very good who puts regular black  olive and banana peppers on a Greek salad not good dressing was not good either I did order my gold wings  there were tasty very but over all   Disappointing"}
{"text":"My first visit here.  Walked a couple of miles from the house and thought why not have a cold beer!  I also had the chicken skewers.  The tables on the patio could use a comfort upgrade - maybe some high tops?  All in all great local bar.  I will be back with my wife!"}
{"text":"so tonight was my first time trying zipps. it was pretty empty for a Friday night, so I was expecting it to be a good night. the waitress was really nice and friendly and got out drinks immediately. but then it took her about 30 min to finally ask \"are y'all ready to order\" by then we were starving. I do understand if it's really busy, and she is busting her rear end to satisfy everyone. but the thing is she didn't have many tables to attend to. it then took about an hour to get our food (strips and wings) I know that isn't her fault so I'm not blaming her on that.. the food was good, but to top it all off. we waited another twenty minutes for the waitress to pick our tabs up.. so honestly, the service was just very bad..."}
{"text":"Aside of the fact that they're huge, the burgers here are really awesome.  I'm a big fan of the wings as well, and the happy hour menu can't be beat.  Beware of the Zipparitas: they may not start out as much, however they'll sneak up on you and that's why there's a three-limit.  Gotta love it!"}
{"text":"Been here two times and we all agreed that we are not coming back.  This place is incredibly noisy to the extent that we are unable to enjoy our food.  The food was alright-really nothing special."}
{"text":"I have been a regular here during football season, and I have to say, it is a 5 star Sports Bar. This is not to say it compares to fancy places like Fogo d' Choa. But when you compare apples to apples, or beer to beer it is one of the best sports bars I've ever been to. 

The GREAT... Their Golden Medium Wings are awesome. 

The Good, The waitresses are awesome. They are always friendly and I've never had a problem, and the Football jerseys are a nice touch. All their burgers and sandwiches are also tasty. The Menu is diverse and always good.

The Bad, there is very limited seating in the bar area. There are a few pool tables which are hardly in use. 

I hope to see you there..."}
{"text":"Went with a large group.  Waitress remembered every individual order.  Everyone enjoyed food and evening.  Nachos were good. Chicken wings meaty and excellent.  Onion rings look wonderful.  Will go again
."}
{"text":"For the second time since they opened I have visited Zipps and thoroughly disappointed.  Sat in the bar tonight and had quite possible the worst service possible.  Don't bother coming here.  Wish I knew the young woman's name that served us so I can tell you if you get her request someone else."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see such low reviews! I've never had a bad time at Zipps! Came here at the end of happy hour on a Friday night for the first time since they moved locations. The place was really busy but was seated right away. The server was nice and got our drink orders right when I sat down. Server was attentive but not annoying and wait time for food and drinks was minimal. Food portions were great but I will say as the menu got bigger so did the prices. Some apps are still really cheap. I thought the outdoor area was a cool touch. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Don't order their nachos. They basically melt the cheese on top of the chips so when you try and grab 1 chip you end up grabbing the whole plate of nachos. Wings was fire tho."}
{"text":"I should have know that one should not order a Philly stay in a sports bar... and Zippo's is no exception."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious! The foccacias and the golden wings are the best. Awesome happy hour, especially the 32oz beer mugs for only $4! Service has always been friendly at this location."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I will never step foot into this place again! I have heard more bad things then good things about this place. This just set the record straight. I can't tell you how upset this situation made me feel.

So we walked in and sat down in the BAR area. I requested to have one of the TVs changed to the UFC fight that was already playing on a different TV but we could not see very well to start with. So as the waitress walks away she comes back with who I assume was the manager I am not sure because he didn't even approach us directly or even speak straight to us but he sure did speak loud enough for us to hear. He said \"we don't show the UFC fights, in fact I'm going to change that channel right now\" I was appalled! I couldn't believe that he just said that. Luckily we hadn't even ordered anything yet so we got up and walked out (I was actually looking forward on trying their wings) 

Unbelievable! Your name has SPORTS in it! So Zipps doesn't consider UFC a sport?! Honestly I felt like I was being discriminated. What if we would have found a table near the TV that was already showing the fight. Would he have came over and it switched it to something else while we were watching it?  Think about it."}
{"text":"Wings are good, beer is cheap and cant forget the nachos and good happy hour and the service isnt bad they always check up on you :)"}
{"text":"Drinks are well poured and reasonably priced. The food is bad...Serve cold and you can see the cooks eating as they prep thru the kitchen window"}
{"text":"Awesome location to just go hang out and grab dinner and drinks. Love their late night happy hour and you really can't beat their chicken wings - golden and mild, please! My husband and I tend to here about once every 2 weeks but one weekend our friends were in town and we found ourselves here 3 days in a row....they loved the wings just as much as we do. Bottom line - always a great go to spot for casual dining and hanging out. Put it in your rotation, like, now."}
{"text":"Except chix wing.  Not that good food.   Service o.k.     Should think about that why not many customers here in such a good location..... Horrible French fri and onion ring....."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here often since it's so close.  The convenience is the best part of this location.  This afternoon we came to watch the AZ Coyotes game.  We asked to put the game on a tv close to our table and it was put on a small tv across the room.  Since the ASU football game had just ended, we asked for the volume also.  The GM said that hockey is boring and their policy is to only play sound during playoffs.  He said they only play college football sound on Saturdays because that's what people want to watch.  There were \"0\" other tables watching tv at this time.  What an ass and what terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Unreal I had dinner here tonight with my wife and daughter . It was not that busy here. The waiter checked on us one time and never to be seen again. The Onion Rings were hard and cold. Our food was really nasty and the service was poor. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Zipps burgers are wonderful.  Great Value and just the right amount of grease.  Their wings do not lie when it comes to the sauce descriptions.  Hot is Hot, not some whimpy version of mild sauce called \"hot\"  I would also recommend the Monaco, its wonderful.

Stay Away from their \"Pizza\"  its not horrible if you have been over served but you will regret it the next day as well as wonder why you brought any home as left overs.  

Overall its a fun sports bar at the right price.  Staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Customers at this spot are pretty friendly as is most of the staff. Others are a little more to the point hustling to do as many tables as possible. So I wouldn't say the service is bad but occasionally more of a New York level of friendly with less staff than a NY pub would have.

The BBQ burger was tasty and cooked perfectly. Some customers were frustrated at too much foam in their beer pours.

Selection of sports is large as I do believe they have all the channels, for example the full MLb package. They did have hockey sound on rather than NBA which seemed to prompt a mixed reception.

Plenty of space for groups other than peak hours and nice outdoor seating when it's not Arizona unbearable temperatures outside. Not sure how good the service would be out there though."}
{"text":"Typically, I'd give them 5 stars, but last night was a HUGE disappointment.  It was a lovely evening and we planned to dine on the patio. But NOOOOO.  They had their misters running full blast and since it was cool the result was akin to \"rain.\"  We asked for the misters to be turned off but the manager refused stating it is now \"Corporate Policy\" to run the misters night and day regardless of the weather.  This is the dumbest thing I've heard in quite a while.  There wasn't a single, solitary person on that patio...on a beautiful night during spring training. Don't go there expecting a nice patio experience unless it is very hot and not at all humid."}
{"text":"I read others reviews, and I am clearly in the middle here. 

Is the food great, no, it's definitely not. Are the fries greasy and do they taste like the fryers aren't cleaned often, yeah folks, I'm afraid so. Are the portions large, yes, very large. Are the beer and other specials priced reasonably, yes, they are. Was my service good? At the bar yes. Jennifer was \"Johnny on the Spot\" and always smiling. 

Reality check. This is a sports bar in the center of ASU. It's predominately a college hangout. It serves its purpose and audience. I had the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, cooked medium. Their was so much sauce on the burger it had a life preserver attached to it. I like bacon cooked medium but raw is just too stringy for me. The fries. Wow! If I would have rung my fries out, I could have lubed my old ride for free. A lot of grease is an understatement. 

Still? I'd go back for the rest of it. It's a good place to hangout and watch some sports and the bartenders take care of their customers."}
{"text":"On the spur of the moment, I decided to watch the Blackhawks game at this location.  I had fairly standard bar food starter of the sweet BBQ chicken wings.  Decent.  I also had the house salad.  Decent.  Nothing outstanding, just bar food with great service.  I have been here a few times."}
{"text":"I have been to this place n times from past year. This is just opposite to my apartment and I love to walk in there on their happy hours and weekend specials. Friday evening and Saturday evening is super busy and you might end up waiting for your order very long. 

I must say the staff are really very fast,friendly and prompt. Their wings and skewers are best all the time. They are always cooked perfect and tastes good for the price we pay here. However ,we always end up with drinks and appetizers. Never got a chance to taste their burgers. So I can recommend by my review only their appetizer and drink section. If you are in a search of a happening bar? A Must Go on weekends."}
{"text":"I had possibly the worse hamburger ever. Its OK to come and have a drink, but the cheeseburger I had looked like someone was mad and threw it together. It was dry, flavorless and just not good. The fries were OK. Unfortunately - I was hungry so I ate it without complaint, I'll be honest. But even if I wanted to, the service left SO MUCH to be desired I probably wouldnt have gotten far. This place has certainly gone down hill from when they first opened up so my suggestions are this...#1. When there are sporting events going on, get more help #2. I love that the staff likes each other, however, dont use work as your social outlet. Hugging and chit chatting are best left to off hours. #3 Management needs to step up and do that. Manage. #4. I can get ignored at the best of places. I certainly would not go out of my way to do it here. Service is priority - that is why people go out and spend their money! #5. Get the good food back. I wont got back at this point - there are a ton of other places I can go and get better food, better service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I eat dinner at Zipp's pretty frequently, and we usually have Ariel as our server. She is a wonderful! Not only does she make helpful recommendations, but she's also extremely friendly and makes the experience that much more enjoyable. We always enjoy our food and chatting with Ariel. Definitely would recommend to anyone visiting Tempe!"}
{"text":"Food is fair, lots of TV's. Today however the waitress and management  felt compelled to chastise us once, twice and then a third time when the manager came to let us know the errs of moving a table to accommodate 6 adults and 2 children party size ( they had us at two small tables and we moved the third over).  Get over yourselves, the place was empty and the #USA vs #POR wasn't starting for three hours.  Thank you Zipps for making a stressful day in 105 degrees just a little more miserable. Up side went home made delicious shrimp and saved money. If I could give no stars I would today."}
{"text":"Great late night place to eat. Got a late dinner and drinks here. Place had a cool vibe. They had a bunch of sports games on tv of course. But they also had a pool table and a shuffle board table in the center in front of the bar. Every day there are specials. We took advantage of the hard liquor specials and the frozen mini margaritas. Everyone ordered something a little different. I got a sweet jalapeño chicken burger with fries, add green chile and cheese. My friends ordered the chicken skewers, salad and pizza by the slice and fish tacos (also on special). 
The drinks were on point and a little on the strong side. The salads were good. The fish tacos which were more like fish wraps (we were prewarned) were just ok. The pizza was a good size and good too.
The chicken skewers were amazing. Deep fried chicken on a stick with ranch and a buffalo sauce for dipping. 
My burger was good. Exactly like the description. So the green chile cheese add. . . I am from New Mexico. We love green chile on everything. There is a New Mexico burger on the menu. I asked if it was possible to do green chile on my fries. I was assured it was ok. However this was a fiasco. The waitress thought I meant Wisconsin green chili, but the cooks told her I would want chili on the fries. The last thing to come out were these damn fries. They were too crispy and had chili over burnt cheese. It's fine. I knew it was gonna be a mess at this point. In the end I explained what I wanted. the waitress felt bad for how long the time was and for messing up the order. I was comped my drink. Very, very nice staff.
I was told the nachos and wings were amazing. Still gonna come back to try those."}
{"text":"Great food! Mozzarella stick are amazing. Good beer and wings. Nice environment tons of TV's. I'm a regular!"}
{"text":"I'll give Zipps 3 stars. Nothing about it stands out, positively or negatively. 

It's solid place to watch a game. They have plenty of TV's, positioned at all angles. My first time at this location was for an ASU game. We were playing Georgia, so the place was packed. The service wasn't bad, considering the crowd.

Their burgers and wings are pretty average. Try the Black & Blue or Green Chile burger. The Focaccia wraps are kinda unique. I recommend the Philly Steak or Monaco. The beer selection is standard; nothing special. 

A solid sports bar all-around."}
{"text":"The black and bleu burger was ok. The patties tasted good for the most part, but it tasted like it had some kind of seasoning salt in it that I didn't really like that much. 

I noticed the bleu cheese was almost non existent as far as taste, way too little of it after opening my burger up to see what's going on. The fact that there were two patties made it impossible to taste it, once I removed a patty, I could taste it a little more. 

We ordered our burgers cooked medium, they came to us well done. It wasn't as dry as you'd expect being that thoroughly cooked, so that was nice. I just ate my burger anyway because I was hungry as hell, and it took quite a while to get to us... I wasn't about to wait any longer. Apparently the waiter didn't put our ticket up for the cook and forgot about it for a little while. We were able to see that from where we were sitting.

The fries were ok as well, not great but not bad either. 


It's been a long ass time since I've ordered anything but water at a restaurant, so I was kind of surprised at $5.00 for two iced teas. 

Other than forgetting about our ticket, our waiter did a pretty decent job. Neither of our drinks bottomed out, and he checked up on us fairly often. 

Overall though, $24 for two burgers and drinks that weren't that great is enough for me to consider going somewhere else next time. I'm not really interested in trying anything else on the menu, or seeing if I get my food faster next time."}
{"text":"Been here 45 mins....no food yet.   Think they need to get their act together in the kitchen.   This is unacceptable.  I hope they get this in order....would love to have a great place like this in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great east valley sports bar! Have been here once with friends who are regulars there, and can see why! Tons of TVs in a newer, clean sports bar! The wings are pretty good, not the best, but well above average, and the beer specials rotate - always including a 32oz mug for 3 or 4 bucks. They also have shuffleboard and a highly addictive golf video game."}
{"text":"We have been coming here in a rotation pattern for Happy Hour and occasionally for a quick dinner.  It's not our favorite, but we keep trying.

Zipps is noisy most of the time simply due to the vast number of little children that mommy and daddy seem to bring.  Maybe that's great for business and more desirable than just adults?  Times have changed but we never let our kids run around screaming and annoying others.  It's too bad the shift manager does not ask the folks to be more courteous of those without children.  It's a BAR.

The food is always good - always.  The menu is vast and it is your typical sports bar in terms of over-all feel. The wait staff is hit or miss.  If you get a good one, one that's attentive, outgoing, and seems to keep everyone happy - you're happy and you'll want to come back.

Goldie's, also a Zipp affiliate, is about 10-minutes away.  If you like Zipps or part of it - you will love Goldie's.  Yes, it's a sports bar, but it just seems geared for regular folks that want to have an afternoon or evening out with friends."}
{"text":"This place was disgusting, there was hair in our food, we refused to eat it and the manager and bartenders told us we still had to pay for it because we ordered it. The bartenders were walking around like they didn't know what they were doing. It was a mess there and I wouldn't recommend this bar to anyone."}
{"text":"Okay I lied this last experience was awful. I called in a carry out they said 10 minutes. It took over 30 if they were busy or something they could have just told me how long it would have been. No apology no offer for a glass of water or even a drink at the bar while I waited I just stood there ignored"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst places we have ever been to. Just moved to Scottsdale, AZ and wanted to get some bar food and watch the game. Went to Zipps Sports Grill at Kierland. The food took almost an hour to get to us. It was cold. There was a hair in my girlfriends food that was even noticed by the waitress once we told her. Food was terrible, service was awful. Never going there again!"}
{"text":"Great service. Happy Hour specials are a deal that you shouldn't pass up. Every day of the week is a new special. Multiple tv's with different the sport games going on. Must try the Zipparita!"}
{"text":"This was a huge disaster. First we live around the corner and come here often. Something has changed the last few times, and it's making me think twice on ever being back. We order to go, We order......
1 buffalo chicken sandwich on fuchsia with fries.
1 kids cheeses burger with lettuce tomato and pickle with frings (fries and onion rings) 
1 with a brownie skillet. 
- What we got was A buffalo chicken sandwich on a tortilla with cold dried up fries. 
- We got the kids burger with lettuce tomato and pickle with again dried up fries which comes with a drink NO drink. 
- We got some brownie batter not baked. I've attached the picture of the brownie. This was just really, really bad. It honestly felt like no one gave a crap about any of it. I really wish I went somewhere else now."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I really like Zipps. I love their foccacia, 1/2 and 1/2 side, and cheap happy hour drinks. Usually we go to the location in Old Towne, but we met a friend up North and figured it's always a safe space to go. Our food lived up to our expectations.

The 1-Star rating goes to the full credit of our server who was stuck-up and unhappy from the get-go. My food came out wrong, she charged me extra for asking to have the dressing on the side, and she insulted my mathematical intelligence by writing and circling our total bill on my credit card receipt because my friend paid cash. All of this with frequent eye-rolls. She even managed to make me feel bad about my food coming out wrong - without so much as an apology.

As a summary, here are words that I would use to describe her attempt at serving:
1. Rude
2. Uninterested
3. Arrogant
4. Nickel-and-dimer
5. Inconsiderate
6. Disrespectful
7. Insulting
8. Impatient
9. Neglectful
10. Blatantly immature

Because of her poor service, I talked to the manager about our experience before we left (Take my word for it, it really was that bad). He apologized for our experience, and was quite friendly. She responded by saying rude things about our table to over 5 of her co-workers within earshot of our table.

This experience was a disgrace to all of the great times we've had at other Zipps locations, and my only hope is that this is an isolated incident."}
{"text":"Good friendly service.   Great sports bar.    Prices great $7 for one of the best burgers I have ever had.   Pitcher of beer $10.    Great place to relax and have beer and watch the game.   Will come back."}
{"text":"Love it. Near my house so it's easy to go in get food and drinks and be on my way. All chicken anything--wings, tenders, skewers with some gold/medium sauce is the business. 2 thumbs up all day"}
{"text":"Had heard alot of good things about this place so gave it a try.  Pretty dissapointing to say the least.  I ordered the club sandwich and unlike any other club sandwich Ive ordered elsewhere this was pretty much just a turkey sandwich, very little ham and a few small pieces of bacon.  Arent \"club\" sandwiches supposed to be tall double deckers??  This looked like something I would make at home.  Definetly not an $8 plus sandwich.  Hubby had a turkey burger, which again at about $8 bucks looked about the size of a regular hamburger at McDonalds.  Red Robin burgers are a million times better for the same price.  The onion rings were soggy and greasy and most of the batter had fallen off.  One bright spot was the slice of pizza we ordered.  Hubby said it was yummy.  All in all this is one of those places where I just dont get what people like about it.  Food was very blah and not worth the money.  Maybe its good for drinks and happy hour appetizers but dont waste your time or money for a meal, there are much better places to go for less money."}
{"text":"I visit Zipps on a regular basis and can report they are consistently wonderful.  The daily specials are a great deal and the servers are very courteous and professional. 
I'd give them five stars if there were more food specials during happy hour."}
{"text":"I loved the pizza and wings when we came last time. My finances order was completely wrong, but nevertheless we still had a great time! We will definitely be coming back more often! It may become our new Applebees! But MUCH better, haha! So far we've only gone on Monday and it's never too packed, or packed at all. I'm not freezing like in other restaurants and the wait is never long!"}
{"text":"Meh. We were very disappointed from the moment we were seated at a clearly dirty table. Also not at all impressed with our $50 bill. We got three drinks and two appetizers. The appetizers tasted and were presented that they were just microwaved.  I can understand why it only has two and a half stars, we just chose this because we were looking for a quick beer and bite on  Easter."}
{"text":"went the other night, won't be back. i asked if they had any beer similar to kiltlifter and they offered blue moon (not even in the same ball park). found out later that they had alaskan amber, which is a little closer, but i'm glad i just had water - i don't want to spend any more money at this place. 

i ordered a grilled cheese with tomato and what i got did not resemble grilled cheese at all. it was a triple decker sandwich made from dry toast and cheese (which was not melted) with tomato and onion. where'd that onion come from? i didn't order that! and how hard is it to make a grilled cheese sandwich? apparently a lot more difficult than i thought. here's a tip to their cook about how to make a grilled cheese: first you need a grill and a cheese sandwich. i'm pretty sure they have a grill and the makings for a cheese sandwich here. you'll also need a little butter to give it some flavor and to keep the bread from burning. you'll also need to keep the cheese sandwich on the grill until you see that the cheese has melted. and midway during the cooking process, you'll need to turn the sandwich so that the both of the slices of bread are evenly toasted. got it?

to their credit, they did offer some zipps cash ($5 gift certificate) to use at a later date. i gave it to my boyfriend - because i will not be back."}
{"text":"Waited over 30 minutes on the patio for service. After making eye contact with 3-4 employees one about 10 occasions and still were not helped we called the restaurant to REQUEST SERVICE!!!  The manager came out 6 minutes later and did absolutely nothing to apologize or see what he could do to remedy the problem. We were out celebrating and were planning on spending some serious cash. Walked right out of there and took our business elsewhere. 2 words: Never. again."}
{"text":"Since this is the place closest to me to watch sports I tend to go here. There is a group of locals that hangout at the bar that are rude, disrespectful, and think they own the place. I have been yelled at by an 75+ year old who was drunk and extremely rude and there is always hammered regulars there every time that harass the female customers. 

If you want an expensive beer, dark atmosphere, and rude regulars this is the place for you! The food is nothing to write home about either."}
{"text":"Quite a disappointment, since the restaurant is nearby in our new neighborhood. Food was excruciatingly slow to arrive at lunch, despite there being only a few customers there. When my hamburger finally arrived, it was seriously undercooked. The waitress argued the point with me (\"we say this is how they're cooked on the menu\") when I asked for it to be recooked. I then had to wait another 10-15 minutes for the replacement meal, and nothing was taken off our bill. With many other promising dining options around here, I won't be returning to Zipp's."}
{"text":"It a nice place to chill and have drinks with friends while watching sports.  They have a good selection of American food and their service is good.  Recommend going when its happy hour."}
{"text":"This review is really based on service and atmosphere rather than food.  We just meet some friends there for a few drinks.  Service was good, beer was cold, not much else I can go on.  The other guys we were with had the chicken skewers.  They all said that they were good.  They looked good and smelled good."}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE!! Ive gone in here a few times and every experience is worse than the last. The food is mediocre and always cooked incorrectly. But what always gets me is how absolutely RUDE the waitresses are. I don't know where they find them but they are the worst surly human beings i have ever had to interact with at a restaurant. I could not help but give this place a 1 star because of how horrible I was treated and talked to in there. I will NEVER go back for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Had dinner this evening, ordered chicken skewers they came out burned. The waitress came back to the table & agreed w me & returned it to the kitchen. Next to us a group of young kids came in probably about 17-18 yrs old. They were swearing, making gestures at the waitress & screaming-I do understand there was a hockey game but they were pounding on the table. Wish the manager would have said something to them, he walked by them a couple of times. Normally we love coming here but we're so disappointed that we didn't even finish our meal."}
{"text":"Time to try the ginger monkey. The service here has gone to sh*t. they replaced the good bartenders with slow, inattentive ones and their bar demeanor sucks. I sat for 6 minutes and 36 seconds with an empty glass and only 5 other people at the bar, yet I could not get a refill. Bartender walked past me twice to check her phone and pour another customers drink and never acknowledged my empty glass. Seems like the best have left and it's time to move on, and that's too bad as this is close and used to be a great place for a drink or two."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, good menu choices! The fries are great. Wings are really good but they could be more crispy. Wish they served Four Peaks beer or more San Tan Brewing choices. I would give 5 stars if they didn't allow smoking on the patio. Non-smokers should be allowed to enjoy fresh air while they eat their meal. This location is much nicer than the Gilbert one."}
{"text":"I've had pretty good experiences at different zipps throughout the valley. Today was a disaster. It wasn't the servers fault or the cooks either. Today was all management. It was empty when we came in, family of 8, and we wanted to see the noon World Cup game. It was empty, I repeat. We sat down and since the table was so small we added another small today to fit our large family. The server came up to us and told us afterwards that we weren't supposed to do this on game day, it was empty, but she'd allow it. So we ordered our first round of food & bloody Mary's because we were starving and thirsty. Then the manager comes up to us and tells us we weren't supposed to move any tables because its game day!? We look around to an empty restaurant and the hungry women state they're 'this' close to leaving since it's empty and we've already been scolded for moving a small table to our large family. He reminds us that's he's just communicating w us and the women had enough and grab their bags. That's six hungry and drinking adults plus to hungry kids, gone over what? Common sense dictates that in en empty restaurant you welcome families. We went to the Garage across the street. Too many good spots nearby to be harassed by a manager in an empty restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh Zipps, how I love thee!
First tried a Zipps about a year ago and now whenever I'm in the Phoenix area, I seek them out. Awesome happy hour and late night specials, every game you could want (ask and they'll put on whatever you want to see), and I've never had bad service. Some even run shuttles to and from spring training games.

Back to Bethany Home. This location is supposedly the newest. We sat in the dining room and it probably had 12+ tvs.  We ordered some appetizers and they came out quickly. Decided to stay for dinner and everything was correct and tasty.  Parking was a little tough here.  And there was a patio that got a little busy once people got off work. 
I'll miss you Zipps! Til we meet again..."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have not written a review bout this place. I have been going here for years (minus the three years in Denver). I love their burgers, golden wings and Focaccias. You have tor try their Philly Focaccia; \"PHILLY CHEESE STEAK FOCACCIA
Top sirloin steak flat grilled with cherry peppers, onions, hot peppers and whole milk mozzarella.\" That sounds yummy right now.  Think of it as a fluffy burrito. You would  think that when they hits a home run with the Philly Focaccia they would do the same with their Philly spring rolls, but they don't, they are not that good. Don't kid yourself, this is a sports bar, but they only have tv's outlining the dinning area and of course the bar area, none hanging from the ceiling in the dinning area. I also love that their reverse happy hour starts at 8:00pm. It used have a lot more items, but heck the economy is bad, so the list shrunk. Their reverse happy hour is specifically daily special. Like \"Tuseday Specialty hamburgers for $6.50.\" I don't frequent this location as much anymore (because I live next to the Gilbert location). But make no mistake, I go Zipps two - three times a month and if my wife and I can't agree on a new place to eat, we go to Zipps.  Also, their regualr happy hour is great too. That menu has a much larger selection. I want to give it 5 stars (I really do!), but it can get noisy and some of their other food items I do not care for."}
{"text":"Couldn't get our wings split in half. 5 hot 5 plain. I run the busiest pizzaria in the valley, and I know unless they're pre cooked you could split wings. Bad business.  Lazy management and staff."}
{"text":"My favorite casual place to visit when I am in town.  I've never had bad service. Always greeted promptly. Service was great. Food was delicious.  Never had to wave anyone down for a refill. Attentive."}
{"text":"Service was slow at lunch time and they weren't to busy. Food wasn't anything special, club sandwich was fresh but no flavor, sweet potato chips were a mistake, not good.My friend had fish and chips and substituted fries for onions rings. It was greasy and nasty, it looked like they used dirty oil. I only gave two stars, those were for the TV's."}
{"text":"We love coming to zipps! Happy hour and Food are awesome. We also love having Jeanette as our server, she's always so friendly and joking with us. We always have everything we need without asking. It's so nice. Also we come about twice a week and mostly see the male manager, mike I believe? He always makes a point to stop by our table and chat with us. These are the people and reasons we keep coming back. Keep up the good work zipps!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh - the food took foreeever.

Doug, our waiter, was very attentive when we first arrived.  Got the drinks, walked by and smiled a couple times, returned when we were ready to order, then disappeared.  He just disappeared!  Luckily, there was a nice \"assistant\" who stopped by for the refills and let us know our food was on its way.

Now, we were not in a hurry, thank goodness, but we arrived at 12:57pm and did NOT receive our food until after 1:30pm...  Give me a break!  There were all of three tables in the dining area and about four tables in the bar area.  Not too busy if you ask me...

When the nice \"assistant\" delivered our food, we were a little disappointed that the food wasn't warm to the touch.  No surprise, right?  The cheese on my burger had already hardened.  But, I'll tell you what - that was one delicious burger.  Not sure if I can credit that to my starvation or if it really tasted that darn good.  Regardless, I ate it with a smile.

Oh, here's a funny.  As soon as the food arrived, Doug suddenly showed up and was very attentive again.

The Zipps on Hayden is much better overall.  Don't think I'll be frequenting this one any time soon."}
{"text":"I used to love the location in Scottsdale, so I chose this one close to the office for an impromptu happy hour. I've gotta say, this was probably not only the worst bar food I've ever had, but it takes the cake of the worst anything I've ever eaten anywhere then handed a check for. I wouldn't have minded the exorbitant prices if I had actually gotten some edible, but over $8 for a quesadilla that looked and tasted like someone threw a piece or two of processed American cheese between 2 tortillas and then popped it in the oven just long enough to completely dry it out was not worth 50 cents, much less what I paid. The rest of my group was no happier, but when happy hour is supposed to be happy, people are collectively reluctant to complain, so we all just moved the food around our plates and vowed never to go back. Don't waste your time here. There's way too many other places in the area to get good food."}
{"text":"Never order take out lunch to pick up at this location. Although placed order at 1140 am and told food would be ready in 20 minutes, I arrived at 1210 pm to pay and pick up food only to wait another 10 minutes. Excuse given was \"You should've ordered earlier!\" If a restaurant can't handle the lunch business, don't have take out!!! I support local restaurants, but can't support Zipps on their lack of customer service."}
{"text":"We used to live in Scottsdale and frequented the greenway/64th zipps and the McCormick ranch zipps often. They were some of our favorite places to hang out. We recently moved down to chandler and started hitting a farmers market near Ahwatukee for fresh eggs etc and noticed there was a zipps there. Awesome!! Or so we thought. A few weeks later we decided we would go for a mid-afternoon wings/beer run and check out our new local Zipps. Walking in for the first time it was immediately clear that this place was not what we were used to or expecting. The vibe was SUPER weird, there was no music on, the only noise was a giant TV that had a tv show on about \"when pregnancy goes wrong\".. we took are seats, looked around and were like.. wth? The service was terrible. Our waitress looked exhausted and like she did not want to be there, no check backs, I had to get up 3 times to get more place settings, ask for a to go box etc because she never came back. We were sat near the restroom and our whole corner smelt terrible. When I asked for them to put the football game on the TV they gave me attitude and put on some baseball game that no one cared about. I called the manager and told him about what was going on and he was a total rookie. He told me \"oh, well, I just got here so.... \"  totally shifted the blame. He came out to our table and basically said the same thing and asked if we wanted a free dessert. We told him that we would pass on the dessert. We were annoyed because he had not addressed or cared about anything we told him and could tell he was just offering a dessert in hopes that we would shut up. Every time we needed something from our or any server, we never got attended to and they were ALWAYS just standing around by the kitchen talking. TERRIBLE service, terrible management, terrible atmosphere. We ended up just taking our food to go because we wanted to get out of there so bad. We gave them a chance to make it right..  SO DISAPPOINTING. We will never go back."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favorite place to get burgers, but after my experience last night I will never go back. The buns they have now are litterally the cheapest lowest quality buns that l can buy at the 99¢ store. The burger was way smaller then it use to be and tasted like a McDonald's burger. Onion rings not good either. Then you gonna charger 50 cents for my honey mustard and ranch for my fries? Why would you do this? How could some place that was soooooooo good 5 months ago that I told everyone I knew how good it was go to lowest quality tasting food? I would have rather gone and ate a jack in the box taco"}
{"text":"Burgers are really good! Freshly made patties. The chicken salads are good and have ACTUAL chicken breast...go figure. 
Cold beer and good wings. What more do you need from your neighborhood sports bar?
My only recommendation would be a thicker bun for the burgers; brioche or ciabatta"}
{"text":"So my sister and I went in to get drunk after a movie. We decided to try zipps as I live in the neighborhood. Thinking that this maybe a good spot to try and maybe become the new hangout for us and also my coworkers since we live and work in the immediate area. Not only did we seat ourselves which was fine but not ONE employee came to our table. WE WAITED 10 mins before deciding to leave. No one greeted us nor even acknowledged us leaving. However a few people that came in after us were greeted and served. Not sure what the issue is. But apparently my money nor business was welcome."}
{"text":"This place used to be one that I would look forward to visiting when I am on town. Unfortunately, when it is game day the food is mediocre at best and the service...well it is poor. Our server is no where to be found. Zipps should be called Zapps... When the crowd thins it doesn't get better. Next time I'll just go to Dukes."}
{"text":"The last two times I've been here we've waited waaaay too long for food. I'm a long time customer and may have to knock this go to restaurant off my list. They didn't even get it right. We waited over 30 minutes for food. The service has gone down hill. Very disappointed.
The manager had to be asked to come to the table. He wasn't even willing to come over. Food still came out cold. 
Got two different stories as to what the problem was. No consistency. Again- very disappointed."}
{"text":"Husband and I went here on a Sunday to meet up for lunch with another couple friend.  I didn't have high expectations as it is a 'sports grill' and not the type of place we frequent... or, to be more honest, we avoid these types of places only because the food is usually not interesting and highly typical (freeze and fry type).  So, I guess we got what we expected - no interesting food.

I was a few months pregnant at the time and so I carried a water bottle with lime juice (which, amazingly enough *really* helps with nausea.. or at least it helps ME with nausea), so I brought that in.  Our waitress was quite rude to me when she asked what I wanted to drink and I told her 'nothing, I'm set here' as I pointed to my water bottle.  She responds, \"sorry but you can't bring that in, rules\"... I quickly explained it was water with fresh lime in it for my morning sickness... she didn't give an eff and said \"keep it outside\".  Whatever.. I stuck it in my big ass purse and kept drinking it like a damn alcoholic sneaking vodka and lime juice in to a sports bar (apparently that's why they have the rule like this!?).

The place is a sports grill, so it was loud and full of Sunday sports fanatics and just not my crowd AT ALL.  I give 3 stars because 4 stars implies I'd be back because I enjoyed myself there.. and two stars says the place sucks at it's job but this place gets plenty of business so I'm sure if it's your type of atmosphere and you enjoy 'bar & grill' food, you'll like this place."}
{"text":"Was here for the first time after living across the street for 20+ years.  Here meeting with a friend who just moved here from Florida.  I ordered BBQ Bacon Burger, all the burgers here came with double stack size and the side you can do full side or half and half with mix and match which I think it was a great idea.  I had onion rings and sweet potato chips.  All of their burger prices are the same, they even advertising their burger and comparing with $12 burgers.  Such a smart move.

I didn't eat my burger right away because I usually save it for next day, but I did finish the onion rings and the sweet potato chips.  The onion rings were okay, a little bit over cooked and dry on the side and I can even taste the batter not fully cooked it.  The sweet potato chips are a bit crunchy on the side, but it does taste good and I love everything that are made of sweet potatoes.

All services here are great and they have a lot of TVs here for all major sports playing all the time."}
{"text":"There was no wait but only six tops available. The hostess told us our party wasn't big enough to sit there so we would have to wait. After waiting for about ten minutes a four top came in behind us and got sat right away because they were bigger. Mind you a game was on so no tables were leaving soon. What a way to treat your loyal customers."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. Wish I could leave zero stars. I am so appalled at how we were treated when we had lunch at this location the other day. There were 2 of us and a service dog, we went to the patio and the waitress told us to take any table. The only other occupied table had 3 ladies who were smoking, so we just took a seat at the other end of the patio near the door that leads to the inside of the restaurant. Waitress took our order, was very friendly and brought our dog a bowl of water. Then the food was served and as we were eating an employee approaches our table and says emotional support dogs are not recognized in Arizona. This was his opening line to us. So I told him that the dog was NOT an emotional support dog he was a certified service dog. The dog's vest cleary states this. I then asked who he was and he stated he was the manager. I was somewhat shocked he was the manager by his unprofessional behavior.  He kept pressing on about emotional support dogs not being recognized in AZ. This went on for a bit so I pulled out our documentation hoping he would leave us alone and let us eat. At this point he asked what the nature of my disability was. This is against the law to ask and I informed him of this. My fiancé repeatedly told him he got what he needed and to leave us alone. We were so distressed by his behavior. The waitress comes over and let's me know the managers name is Brett. That told me a lot when she did that. There was really nothing more we could have done to prove our position nor should we have had to. Then moments later Brett comes BACK to the table interrupting our meal once again. He says he called his operations manager and informed us of the questions he is legally able to ask and proceeded to do so. At his point the food is cold, the other patrons that have since showed up are hearing all this, and were looking at Brett and shaking their heads in disbelief at his behavior. I was so embarrassed and felt so harassed. My fiancé stands up and tells this guy to leave us alone but he didn't he just kept pressing on!!!  My fiancé finally said if he didn't leave us alone he would call the police. It was that bad. 
Brett finally scurried back into the restaurant saying he would buy our lunch. The cold lunch he wouldn't allow us to eat. The waitress came over very apologetic and we just gave her our card because we wanted to get out of there asap and didn't want her to lose her tip as we did not have cash to give her. As we left one of the ladies from the smoking table said she was sorry that happened to us and offered her phone number as she witnessed it all. 
When we got to our car I called corporate. Tiffany the marketing/PR rep took our information and we have since heard nothing. I then called another location and got the operation managers phone number. Placed a call to Jason S. and left a vm. Big surprise no call back from him. 
Not sure why 2 people with a service dog sitting on a small patio next to a busy road amongst smokers were such a threat to Brett. But apparently harassing innocent patrons while they are trying to eat is Brett's management style. Brett needs to grow up, learn professionalism, tolerance, people skills and most of all how to read a situation. Brett you are far from management material. 

There are laws through the ADA to protect people from being treated this way. I will be filing a complaint with Department of Justice Civil Rights division."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has such low reviews... 5 stars all the way!! I'm so happy they opened one right down the street from me.  Zipps is awesome, they have great happy hour specials (take it from me I'm a broke college student) and the service always does their best to make you happy and correct any mistakes, not that I'm one to complain. ever.  People have to understand that this is a SPORTS BAR, and not a fancy shmancy restaurant.  You come here to get a few drinks,  chow on some burgers and watch sports with your buddies or dates.  

Which leads me to the food....  ZIPPS HAS THE BEST BURGERS EVER, Try the sweet jalapeno burger.  (it's not spicy, it's sweet and amazing!! ask for jalapenos on the side if you want to be a baller ;)"}
{"text":"I'm giving 1 star since the service is good. The food itself gets 0! 2 people of our group got sick. 

Came here with a group of 6 everyone ordered food. Everyone was disappointed. 

The Golden wings are no longer good. Not crispy like before. The chicken fingers weren't good. The fries were dropping oil, it was gross. The Primo Focaccia must have had a bad part of the steak bc more than half of it was rough and chewy like it had not been trimmed correct. The Monaco Focaccia was good. The burger was small, the beef had no flavor & they had forgot to put the cheese. 

To top off all the bad food they are a bit pricey. Too much for what there serving. 

I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I love Zipps. I was excited to see them opening a location on Mill. The place is quite large and naturally has lots of TV's. Nice outdoor patio but in amazed people can smoke out there with it being so close to the entrance. What can ya do?  The service was ridiculously slow. It was a Thursday night and not super busy. We were done eating done drinking and still waited twenty minutes for the check. Ridiculous. I gave two stars because the fish and chips was amazing."}
{"text":"This place was packed on a Saturday afternoon. Lots of good specials even on the weekends. So many TV's to choose from. They have a shuffleboard table and a pool table. Fish and chips were delicious!"}
{"text":"Came out here with some friends last night. It was more of a \"let's try and settle down because we drank waaaaay too much at happy hour\" kind of spot. 

It's your typical Zipps. The layout is much better than the Old Town location. 

On this particular Friday night, the Zipparita machine was broken, so we were treated to Zipparitas on the rocks. They were a little \"zippier\" than usual, but who cares. No one had to work this morning.

I ordered some wings. Tasty. As always.

Solid.

I'd come back if I found myself in Chandler. Although, I like sticking to Scottsdale and Phoenix."}
{"text":"Zipps is consistent. Always tasty bar food, good drinks, shuffledboard and good games."}
{"text":"Not a very pleasant experience tonight. Over-charged during happy hour.   Not by much,  just $5.00 but I decided to mention it to the manager.  OMG 
Instead of making the correction I had to listen to his lecture on how it is not possible for them to be wrong. They were wrong so I suggest you check
Your bill carefully because if they can charge you full price during happy hour they most surely will.  Don't expect their managers to be fair, you'll only get a lecture on how their charges are ALWAYS correct ant the customer is never right."}
{"text":"First time here...daughter and I just ordered appetizers...pretty good. Quesadilla was a bit on the spicy side. Televisions everywhere..definitely a good place to come catch a game. A little slow with coming back to check on our table."}
{"text":"Zipps is my favorite place to watch a game on Mill Ave. It's always fun to come here on game day for ASU home or away games and it's great for Sunday football. I also come here to watch my hometown teams play because they more than likely have the game on one of their many TVs. The food is great as well. I love the buffalo wings and any of the focaccia sandwiches are delicious. The only negative thing I'd have to say is that the service is a little slow sometimes. It has gotten a little better each time I have returned so I will definitely keep coming back here as a regular."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out because I've heard people at work talk about going to the Via de Ventura location for lunch.

First off, once we seated ourselves, the waitress came over.  My husband asked about the beers on tap.  They had many kegs to choice from.  She was clueless and didn't know what they had, so he asked her for a beer list.  She said they didn't have one.  Okay, then he asked for a Stella.  She went to get it, then came back and said sorry we don't have that.   Heineken?  Only in bottles.  The only beer she knew for sure they had was Dos Equis, Coors Light, Ultra etc.  And she was not even one bit polite.  She made me feel like we were inconveniencing her.  

Then we order Fish & Chips with a side of salad.  About a half hour later, the food was brought out.  We received Salad & Fish, no chips.  I thought it was strange so I asked the waitress about the 'Fish & Chips' we ordered with the side salad.  
 
She said that is what we ordered, she said no, you ordered the Fish & Chips with side salad.  I'm like yes, I know, where are the potatoes?  She said that the side we ordered was the salad, so we didn't get fries.  She got really snippy with us.  

Less than 1 minute later, some guy comes out with an attitude and asks us if something is wrong.  I assume he was the Person-In-Charge so I tell him that we didn't get what we ordered.  I explained it the same way i explained it to the waitress.  I added to him that they shouldn't advertise Fish & Chips if that is not what the customers get.  You need to change it to Fish & A Side.  He condescendingly said Well that doesn't roll off the tongue too well.  I said but then it would be more accurate.  He continued to argue with me, getting louder.  I gave up.  I realized that I would not get any where when the PIC is arguing with me.  

I should have read all the reviews before we went here.  I feel like we wasted $36 on a crappy meal & some really bad service.  I might have decided to return, and chalk up our visit as just bad food.  But when you go into a place to eat and the staff are arrogant a-holes, who would return?


mediocre service + bad attitude = Buh bye!"}
{"text":"NEVER EATING HERE AGAIN. Horrible service, I ate the food that was served to me(I had a burger) and puked it out 4 minutes later and the Manger REFUSED to take it off the check and threatened to call the police on me and my mother because we were stating that their food was OBIVOUSLY the problem, I'm a heathly guy and NEVER puke after eating food, but for some reason my body rejected the food and she argued that because I had a bite of the burger she couldn't do anything about it..? We called the Zipps and left a voice mail about the their horrible manager and they never called us back..? Shows how much they care about customer service..."}
{"text":"The other Zipps locations seem to be a lot better in terms of service / food. The service was neutral at best. The onion rings were terrible...dry, cold, and hard as rocks. If this location makes it another year I will be thoroughly surprised."}
{"text":"Really solid family sports bar. Great wings and good food. Get the golden wings! They also have some great specials. If you have kids and want to catch a game this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Food is okay for a sports bar.  Not the best and not the worst.  The place tends to be really loud so having a conversation can be a challenge.  Nice selection of sporting events on the tv."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this Zipps. Manager Alfred could careless about the wait time getting food and drinks also cooks serving raw turkey burgers. Will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"Where do I start! Our waitress Holly was amazing I asked for a BLT with crispy bacon and crispy fries! Did I get that? No! Holly had to go back to the kitchen and ask them for crispy bacon! What really sucked is we sat by the kitchen and the manager gave Holly a hard time because she asked that the kitchen read her tickets right! 5 stars for Holly and no stars for the kitchen! 
My husband order a bbq chicken sandwich and I think he spit out 90% of it because it was fatty or to tough to eat! I think it was a bbq sauce sandwich with a small chicken gross patty! This is not to spend 10 mins complaining to a manager or owner that probably want do a single thing to make it right but maybe Zipps kitchen needs to get it together! We have been to Zipps maybe 10 times and 2 times have been okay not bad! But if you ask me 2 out of 10 times is not good odds! We live close by and would love to call Zipps are weekend bar but we can't it's going to take a lot for us to come back!

Thanks again to the only reason we would ever come back! HOLLY 

Hopefully someone will listen,

{"text":"I came here for lunch right after they opened with a friend. The food was OK but I have to admit that the waitress was not especially customer service focused. My friend asked for more sauce for her wings and two things happened: 1)  she charged us more than she said she was going to for the \"lunch special wings\" and 2) she charged us for the sauce! When we asked about it she just said she must have been wrong about the lunch special. Did nothing to make it right with us! I was surprised. 

Also a pet peeve: none of these places that have sports on TV EVER show women's sports on any of the sets. Why is that?"}
{"text":"Not a fan at all. The only reason we ended up here was because nellos pizza had a 45 minute wait. The food service was quick and the waitress was really good, but the food was horrible. This place raves about how good the hamburgers are, but they are not. 

The bun was ok, the hamburger meat reminded me of mystery meat in elementary school. I had a good amount of pickles on the burger and in my basket, so I tried one of the loose pickles and it tasted like someone dipped it in hairspray and perfume. The fries were also soggy and cold. I asked one of the guys in our group how his burger was and he commented \"I knew this place was not going to be good\". 

I hope someone who cares about this place reads these reviews, as the location is pretty good and it would be a great place to watch football. But, the food does need to be improved."}
{"text":"Worst management I have ever encountered. Zipps is one of my favorite restaurant and my boyfriend and I frequent the one on Camelback and the one on Mill. We decided to try this one since it's close to where he just moved. Awful service. Terrible. We took a seat in the dining room, nobody approached our table for over five minutes. The manager ran food to the table next to us, looked at us and walked away. We decided to go to the bar. Management decided to schedule one bartender while the U.S. was playing the World Cup. The bartender was doing her best to keep up, but she was  slammed. We got our drinks fairly quickly and then took 30 minutes to flag her down to order our food. 30 minutes later we got our food and it was cold. We alerted the bar tender, told her it wasn't her fault, and asked to speak to a manager.  The manager was a complete asshole and all but laughed in our faces. Encouraged us to write a bad yelp review. It was so disrespectful we were shocked. Corporate, please get this guy out of your restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm the Duke!!! THE DUKE!!!! OMGWTFBBQ! But no. Duke be not proud. The REAL regulars don't have that obsessive compulsive urge to check in at every little place they just pass through or pass gas at. So yeah - it's the neighborhood bar and I can stumble home from here. What's not to like? And of course, when it's that close you tend to drink a little more - especially when there's no need to worry about a DUI. I have a friend that comes here because he doesn't want to drink alone at home - 'cause THAT means you're an alcoholic. LOL. So he gives me a call and we both come here to avoid being alcoholics. Place is in the same mall as CVS Pharmacy, Chase Bank, and Jimmy & Joe's Pizzeria. As far as the menu - I think their burgers are decent. I stay away from the onion rings though - too thickly breaded for my taste. Pizza slices are decent and so are the wings. Haven't tried any of the salads - maybe someday when that testosterone deficiency kicks in. Haven't tried any of the desserts either - chocolate and beer just don't mix too well. Beers - they have Dos Equis on tap - comes with a slice of lime. Also Blue Moon - comes with an orange slice. Gotta get your Vitamin C somehow, right? Also there's the Zipp's version of margaritas - Zipparitas. As in Zipparita doo dah Zipparita day. All sorts of flavors like watermelon, peach, chambord... Oops. Forgot what the other flavors were... got a disk read error from my noggin - must have had too many of those Zipparitas. Service is always pretty decent. Or maybe it just becomes that way when you start to know the waitresses by name. And they have one of those TouchTunes jukeboxes. Just get the TouchTunes app, find the most obnoxious song in the catalog you can find that isn't filtered for this location and play it multiple times - hilarity ensues. Just kidding. Me do that? No way. Not unless I was hammered or something."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the Farm House Meadows right down the street from the Gilbert Zipps. I was excited when I came for the first time last Sunday! The bar tender was great, the patrons were friendly, and the food was delicious! I had such a good time playing pool, shuffle board, and hanging out I came back Monday with one of the guys on my Landscaping Team! We had such a great time we stayed from 7-11 shooting pool, playing music on the juke box, and enjoying a large meal! Our server Tanya, was amazing she had a huge section to attend to, but did such an amazing job that you would have thought we were her only table.

With the above said, my mind was blown when Sebastian (the same person who was there with me Monday) and I returned Thursday! While I went to the quarter machine to make change for pool and the juke box, the server informed Sebastian that he needed to be 21 yrs of age to shoot pool at that time or even be in the restaurant. He told me about the rule which we were unaware of. We were hungry and ready to eat, and bummed out cause we rode our bikes there. I asked to speak to the manager to ask if he could make an exception and allow us to eat dinner on the patio, out of the bar area. He informed me of the strict company policy that he needed to adhere to and that there was no way we could stay. 

At that point I understood the policy and respected the rules. I politely asked to have  the 15 dollars in quarters I had got exchanged for cash (as I rode my bike and did want to loose the coins on the ride home). He then rudely said, \"I would have to roll all those quarters, and I don't have time for that.\" I said are you kidding me?!!! And he said yes I can't make change for those quarters unless YOU roll them for us! At that point I lost my cool and was very frustrated. I told the manager I would take my business elsewhere and would never be back again! He just said ok and walked into his office.... Wow my mind was blown!!!

Our server from the other night Tanya, observed my frustration with the manager, and asked what happened? I told her and she on her own time, as she had just clocked out, took my quarters, apologized for the manager and said I hope you guys do come back! 

I highly doubt that we will be back! But if we do come back it won't be on the Thursday night managers shift!!!  

I'm not sure, but maybe you should start \"making time\" for customer service, because I don't have time for that B.S.!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the lack of good customer service fro Zipps in general. We spend probably $30 per week across several Zipps locations, so it's seriously sad that my review is over 3 bowls of chili...

On Thursday last week, we ordered take out from Zipps. When we got home, they had gotten our order wrong. We called to let them know, and since I'm 9 months pregnant, I'm not really interested in having to drive all the way back to the restaurant for them to give us the right food. We asked for a refund, but they said their POS system doesn't allow them to give refunds so instead we could get \"Zipps Bucks\" to use on a future order. Ok, fine, whatever.

Fast forward to Sunday. We ordered 3 bowls of chili to go, and when we got home with them, each one was only half full. Again, I called and said at this point two mess ups in a matter of days was unacceptable and asked for a refund again. The manager gave me the phone number of their corporate office and said that Tiffany would be able to help with the matter. I called Tiffany this morning and told her the story, so she told me she would \"research\" the incident with her ops team and get back to me. She called me several hours later to tell me that since we had eaten the chili, they were not going to give us a refund. She also said that they did in fact give us the correct amount of chili for our order, but the cups they serve it in are just oversized. I told her that every single week when I order chili from other Zipps locations, the same cup is filled to near the top. She said those other locations were clearly doing it wrong and she was still not going to give us a refund (oh, btw the chili costs $5 per bowl, so this is a refusal of a refund of $15 for a customer who spends over $1500 per year at their establishment...)

Want to know the best part? Tiffany told me over the phone that she is the Director of their corporate office, so there's no sense in me talking to her boss (the owner) because he sides with her and this was their decision together. Guess what her title actually is? Director of Marketing and Public Relations... Interesting way to treat a customer when you're in charge of PR...

It's a shame. Zipps is one of our favorite places to go. But the fact that their customer service is living in an alternate reality where a justifiably upset customer gets treated like garbage is really not a solid way to run a business. Hence why almost all of their locations are rated 3 stars or lower on Yelp. 

For the owner: if you're reading this, I highly suggest taking better care of your most loyal patrons."}
{"text":"It was our first time here. Right when we walk in there was no sign that we saw that said open seating. We stood there for a good minute trying to figure out what we should do since we didn't see anyone. A lady come around the corner and told us. We order our food. As we are sitting I notice more people coming in and are looking lost just like how we were about the open seating. Now it might have been that we were really hungry, but our food took a while. We both ordered wings. When we got there, they did have a few people seated so we didn't understand why it took as long as it did. When we wanted our check the waitress was no where to be seen. My friend had to ask someone else for our checks. They deftly need to work on there service. Over all I didn't like the experience, but my food was good so I will consider coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to watch a football game in the area, or any sport for that matter. There are daily deals, and specials that are offered, which make them different than a lot of the overpriced sports bars across Arizona. Not everyone is upper-middle class or in the 1%, so it's great to see that value is taken into account with their pricing, as well as consideration to the everyday man's wallet. $6 wings during happy hour during the week?! Need I say more? Yes, I actually do, because this bar won an award for best wings in the Phoenix Times (try their unique sweet style--none like them). However, they offer a lot more than that fooodwise, and the portions are wonderful. When you order a salad, you get a REAL salad, and can even feel a little satisfied after the darn thing. When you order a ZIPP's burger, you get a REAL burger. When you order a...well, I think you get the idea.

All that rambling, and I didn't even talk about the service! Wow. Shame on me, but it's surprising in this era of lack of customer service and manners, to find a place that values its customers, and treats them like so, in the establishment itself. I've been here many times, and I've never been disappointed. If by chance you have, or had a bad experience, give it a second shot. The place is well run, VERY CLEAN, and opening multiple locations for a reason. :)

5 stars if ya add grilled wings option :)"}
{"text":"Their wings are great but everything else on the menu is honestly just meh. Average at best. I've had their quesadilla, it was bland. I've had their green chili chicken rolls which are kind of a combo between Asian and southwest styles but not done well. Very strange item on the menu. I've had their burgers; nothing to rave about. Their pizza is ok, but again nothing incredible. In writing this review, I almost wonder why I keep eating here. I guess for the wings. Not worth eating here unless you only want wings."}
{"text":"Nothing like Zipps! 

Today, I met up with a couple of old co-workers at this location. We had some cocktails and grub. I usually go to the location on Camelback, but this was right around the corner from my friend's house, so it worked out perfectly. 

Day drinking is on-point here, if that's your thing. They have various drink specials on Sat-Sun from 11-4. The food, is consistent as with the other Zipps locations (and Goldie's). 

I had the Philly Steak Eggrolls today, and I was expecting a large serving. It only came with two, so when we left, I ordered a Chopped Salad, which much more generous in size.

Service was the only thing bringing this place down a star from it's usual 4-star self. We waited a good 10-15 minutes to get our check. The server was busy serving other drinks, even though she had our receipts ready to go.

I'd still come back, because I love Zipps. I'm willing to give it another go, and maybe next time, I will bump it up another star."}
{"text":"Ordered wings with a basket of fries and asked for a side of cheese to dip my fries in. They serve nachos but don't use nacho cheese and the only melted cheese they have is with their pretzels however you can get a side of it unless you order the pretzels. Not even if you just pay for a side of cheese. Why wouldn't they try to accommodate the customer? It's just cheese!!"}
{"text":"*Crying* I actually really like Zipps. I went there quite often during the March Madness.

They just opened and I haven't really had any of the bad service that others have described. I've opened or helped open various restaurants and every place is going to have growing/opening pains. That is just how it is! I wouldn't give up on it quite yet folks. If the other Zipps around the valley are of any indication, then they will shape up soon."}
{"text":"Had a very poor waiter named Paul b. Won't coming  back!!! The manager Susan didn't seem very responsive to customers needs."}
{"text":"My first- and last visit to Zipps. Food took 40 minutes for burgers.  My fries were swimming in grease.   Too many good places so will pass on this one."}
{"text":"We love this bar!  Service is always fast - the wings are great, burgers are great and my personal favorite is the honey balsamic salad with chicken.  The chicken is really good - grilled to perfection - not dry at all -- and the salad is way more then you would every expect from a sports bar:  goat cheese, candied pecans and craisins.  The dressing is simply de-lish!!!

Great happy hour specials change daily plus late night 8 pm to close specials."}
{"text":"Magic hat number 9 is a refreshing summer ale. The fish burrito was large and very filling. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"Best wings in town, outstanding staff and management. On a recent visit, we had a small issue with our order. The manager quickly got involved and fixed everything. I wish I could remember his name. My family really enjoys Zipps, particularly this location. We drive a couple of extra miles to come to this location."}
{"text":"I come here often with my family, and we usually order wings. They are the best wings in town, but there is one aspect of this that is really starting to bother me. For every order of 10 wings, there are about 7 drums and 3 flats in the order. This has been the case for over 100 orders we have had. It cannot be random; they are doing this on purpose. Everyone in my family prefers flats over drums, but would be willing to settle for a reasonable mix. On a recent visit, I finally asked our server if they could please make half the order as flats. We were very nice and polite about it. I thought she was going to have an aneurysm. She seemed genuinely terrified of passing on this request to the kitchen, and stressed there were no guarantees. OK, whatever. To her credit, our wings arrived with about a 50/50 ratio for 4 orders. What's the deal with this? I don't want to go through this ordeal every time I come to this place. Every chicken has an equal number of drums and flats. What are you people doing with the flats? Are you hoarding them for the apocalypse?  I must know the answer! Very tasty wings, though. We will be back."}
{"text":"Got the golden hot wings and they were excellent.  Wings do tend to be on the hotter side.  Beer selection is terrible for a sports bar."}
{"text":"People are ridiculous! (Julie L) Actually I think it's great that a restaurant will actually cut you off if you've had to much! Way to go Zipps! I bet if you go out and get in an accident after a drink or 2 then you'd be suing the restaurant and the server! Joslyn gives wonderful service all the time!!!!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood for years, but haven't had a Big Zipp burger for awhile.  I decided to remedy that this morning. Here's what happened . . . I phoned in an order for a Big Zipp for carryout just as they opened at 11:00.  It took about 15 minutes.  So far so good. However, when I arrived home, I discovered that my sandwich had no cheese, no pickle, no lettuce, and - worst of all - no special sauce, i.e., it wasn't a Big Zipp. What it did have were two plain hamburger patties surrounded by a bun.  That's it.  And, to top it off, the onion rings weren't even fresh.  I was in a rush so I just ate the sandwich and a few of the rings.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  I hope they figure out what is an obvious and easily avoidable QC problem.  However, for me, there are too many other dining options nearby and I won't be returning.

Update:  I just read Zipp's unintentionally amusing response to my review.  Pretty hard to believe, but apparently it was my fault after all:  I was remiss in not opening the styrofoam container to make sure there was tartar sauce, etc., on my burger.  Silly me.  I was also at fault for ordering carryout because, according to Zipps, it's probably not as good as dining in.  And as for the 'old' onion rings that deteriorated on the way home - I live three blocks away.   Lol.  What a clown show.  But it does explain a lot."}
{"text":"I have never written a review before but after last night I feel I must.  First of all when you order a focaccia sandwich you are expecting a certain type of bread    I ordered the pepper jack focaccia and it came as a wrap and not on focaccia bread.  The second issue was when you order a salad and you are paying $8 for you expect more than just lettuce and a few pieces of chicken.  It would of been nice to have some tomatoes, onions, cucumber or anything else.  The third issue it was unbearably warm in the restaurant.  Now grant it here in Phoenix it was a very hot day, however I have been in numerous restaurants on hotter days and never felt uncomfortable temperature wise.  The last and final issue was service was slow and not talking about the waitress she was very kind and kept bringing us water and pop as needed.  The food took forever to get to us.  Overall would not recommend this place and they lost a customer.  By the way this was in the Ahwatukee location"}
{"text":"I have always had good service and good to excellent food at any Zipps location.  BUT if you want a burger that is absolutely delicious and cooked just right this is the place!! My favorite burger is the green chili cheese burger which comes with 2 beef patties and is guaranteed to be so juicy that it will drip down the front of your shirt (happens to me all the time!!!!) 

And, if you are chicken wing \"aficionado\" you can go mild to smoking hot but also try their dry wings (my choice). 

The place can get a little noisy particularly in the evenings and some of their locations are worse than others. I don't think acoustics is big priority when they set up their restaurants so if you don't mind hearing all of the conversations that are going on at the same time or are half deaf (that what my wife says) then it won't bother you!! 
           
So ....... in conclusion, at least 4-stars and if you want to dribble hamburger juice down the front of your shirt, this is the place!!!"}
{"text":"I want to write a review about this specific Zipps, but more about the gal who served my girl friend Kelly and me the other day. Serena P. (her name was on the ticket and I took a pic to write this) 

Serena was amazing. Her service and attentiveness was perfect. Around enough to be completely satisfied with the amount of service and subtle enough to hardly notice she's one it, 100% Just a pleasure. 

Kelly was a server for years and subconsciously critiques so much about servers and service in general. To be honest, she even critiques me! She feels it's rude to ask a service to have a burger cut in half, for example. Well, Serena heard us mention Kelly and I split our meals and came back with our burger already cut! It was very thoughtful and absolutely perfect. I was then able to tell Kelly that I was right! Some servers don't mind having your burger cut in half. 

Bottom line, Serena was great.

Food: If you come here, make sure to try to bleu cheese with the wings. The golden hot is so hot but has great flavor. My fave is dipping golden medium wings in golden hot and then bleu cheese. Yum! And the sweet jalapeno burger with the turkey patty. Amazingly delicious! Beware of the golden hot. A little at a time.

Drinks: If you like beer and margaritas, then you have to try the beer with a floater. We get Dos Equis floaters with a lime. They'll get you. 

Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place whenever I need a quick bite, especially happy hour!

The wings here are cooked to be nice and juicy on the inside, but crispy on the outside! I am a fan of the golden variety, which has the same spice levels as your classic wings, but is a bit sweeter. I'd advise coming to specials, happy hours and select nights, to get a dozen wings for 5 bucks. Sweet deal!

The homemade onion rings here are perhaps the best I've eaten, and the burgers are great for a good bite. I don't know about other people, but my BBQ Bacon Burger was cooked evenly to a medium rare consistency, which I liked.

The staff is decent, and the time for food and refills is short even on busy nights!

I'm not even a sports fan, but I can dig this sports grill."}
{"text":"I'm not even going to waste my time with an in depth review of this place.  The menu is generic and the food mostly repulsive - guac dip, Monaco \"focaccia\" (nothing focaccia about it, it was flat bread plain and simple), even the onion rings and fries were gnarly (and I'm Irish and must eat potatoes with every meal).  The clientele was immature, obnoxious, and way too drunk for 4:30 on a Friday (I'm talking connecting several straws together and walking around to other tables to drink from their beers through the extendo-straw. . .oh, and taking pictures of each other's ass cracks).  The service was miserable (I must have said \"no ranch dressing\" about 10x and still somehow wound up with it, and our waitress seemed unable to deal with the four tables in her section nor had any clue what the marinated chicken was marinated in).  And for a sports bar, my husband and I were literally the ONLY ones in the place interested in any of the games they were showing (though people were cheering \"suck, suck\" for the aforementioned extendo-straw chick).

The only possibly redeeming thing about this place is that it is ridiculously cheap for happy hour and their nightly specials.  But you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my night here tonight! Right when we walked in it was super packed. We couldn't find our own seat in the bar area so moved on to the dining area for 8 people. The zipparita is actually very good for the happy hour at only $3. When it says there's a limit on the menu, I knew I would get my money's worth of alcohol.

When we ordered food, we got the mild buffalo wings and the chips and guac.... Not a bad wait for both of the items with how busy it was. The buffalo wings in mild were way too bland for me so we had to get a side of medium sauce for the extra kick. For the chips and guac, both very good but had to a season the guac with much more salt and pepper. For the rest of the night it was just more drinks.

For it being March Madness, I would love to be back here again during this week. A great place to watch games as TVs are absolutely everywhere. Keep up the nice work as a new sports bar on Mill and people will continue to come in! Be back soon!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, but the service was terrible.  Had to ask for silverware, had to ask for bill multiple times.  It was ridiculously loud.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and was a little nervous but we were popping in for a quick app.  The place seemed clean, open and friendly.  Our server was attentive and nice.

Our food (mozzarella sticks) was weird as a spring roll but it might be fun for people who love cheese and slightly soggy spring rolls!

Also ordered chicken fingers (with wing sauce) and fries, sauce was HOT!!! And the fries a little on the soggy side.  

A good quick stop but nothing fancy.

Lastly ordered a drink and it was not right, handled a little oddly, not sure we would ever come back."}
{"text":"Good wings. They were ginormous. I felt like putting my feet up on the bench, and no one gave me any guff about it. You don't need much coin to eat at hh here, friends. Great wait staff, awesome work."}
{"text":"Onion Rings.  Quite simply the best I have ever tasted.  Everything else on the menu is good, too!  Go for Happy Hour and you can get domestic draft beers in HUGE frosted mugs for a very cheap price!  We will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"This is our local lunch spot. We try to come here on the weekends when we're running around. I just tried their BLT & Green Bay Chili. I usually have the steak salad, but wanted something more. The Chili is really excellent. Meaty, with a crisp bite to it. No need to cheese or sour cream in it. Servers are all friendly and know their stuff - and we've gotten to know them over time. Just a great, friendly, neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"Had lunch here.  Ordered steak nacho's and club sandwich.  The nachos were so stuck together with cheese hard to eat and really need more on them...The club sandwich very dry.  Nice atmosphere but okay \"bar food\""}
{"text":"Great place to eat, drink, and watch sporting events! Smoking on the patio (with mist system) but get there early if there are some big games on to get a table. Service can be a spotty sometimes, but overall this is a great place to hang out with friends and family."}
{"text":"Stopped by last night. First time. I wasn't overly impressed with our hostess. She didn't smile, or seem to happy to see a customer. The place was pretty empty. Lots of tables if you were to have a party! Nice patio area out back with misters too.

They have daily specials, but I didn't notice them until after we had ordered. Bummer! Our waitress was OK, but again not overly happy/nice. The menu is mostly bar food - burgers, fries, onion rings, wings, etc. Not really enough to keep me coming back, but the fries were delicious! 

Overall it was A-OK, but I won't be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"The WORST customer service I can say I have literally experienced. We arrived And our waitress asked if we would like anything to drink. We ordered our drinks and she returned with our drinks in a timely manner. She then proceeded to ask if we would like appetizers. Keep in mind there are 4 of us. I replied that I would like mozzarella sticks. She said \"OK\" and walked away. We attempted to get her attention, but she conitued to walk away. She returns with the mozzarella sticks and we didn't say anything and the rest of my party just ordered their meals. About 10 minutes later a couple walked in and they placed their order. About 10 minutes later they received their meals. With that said they had ordered chicken wings, which is EXACTLY what we ordered along with a salad and chicken sandwhich. 20 mins has past and we have YET to see our waitress. She came out about 2 minutes later at which point we had to get her attention. She comes over and we ask where our food is? She says \"Oh let me go check on that for you!\" 5 minutes has passed and our waitress has not returned  and we decided it's time to go. We walked to the front and paid for our drinks but they didn't add the mozzarella sticks. At this point while she was ringing us my friend asked if he could speak with the manager. She walks back to get him and he has our food. We inform him that at this point because of the horrible service we have received we are going to eat at another establishment. He proceeds to say, you ordered crispy wings which takes longer to prepare. My friend told him, the people behind us came in 10 minutes after we did and received their wings about 10 minutes later so your comment is just an excuse and we left. Lack of communication with your customers is the #1 reason I will ever write a negative review. Had our waitress come and checked up on us at least once and let us know that it should be about another \"designate at time frame\" we would have been patient and waited. The Simplest little things can make the biggest difference.."}
{"text":"After living in the valley for 13 years and having moved several times throughout the years, we have always been frequent and loyal customers to various Zipps locations.  There are several reasons we love this place...laid back atmosphere, great beer prices, delicious onion rings, and the BEST ranch we've ever had.

Last night was the first time we went to the Zipps off Warner and this location is now one of our favorites!  The layout of the restaurant is great, with a lot of room in the bar area.  Our server was super friendly and attentive.  At other locations, they changed the happy hour $4 beer to exclude Bud Light, so we were excited to see this location included it for the happy hour price - thank you!  I ordered one of my usual favorites, which is the monaco focaccia.  It was the BEST monaco I've ever had at any Zipps location - delicious!  

Highly recommend this Zipps location to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Since moving here in 2004, Zipp's has been our go-to place, no matter where we moved to in the valley.  The food has always been excellent, with the Monaco being my personal favorite.  Don't even get me started on the BEST ranch I've ever had.  Seriously, that divine sauce needs to be bottled and sold!!  I do want to share our past experience at Zipp's, as we were really disappointed with a recent change made to the happy hour menu.  For as long as I can remember, the big frosty glass (I think 32 oz.) of draft beer has always been $4.  On our recent visit, we unknowingly ordered our regular Bud Light, only to find out the happy hour price only applies to Coors Light and Miller Lite now - really?!?!  I understand the need for raising prices, but this seems like an unnecessary change, especially since Bud Light is just as common as other light beers.  Will this change stop us from going to Zipp's again - probably not. We'll continue going back because of the amazing food, fun atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"The place isn't high on atmosphere, it is kind of a sports bar/cafeteria.  The tacos were loaded with grease.  My kids were disgusted.  I really should have sent it back for something else.  The \"focaccia\" is a thick, undercooked wrap.  The onion rings weren't crisp, they were hard."}
{"text":"Zipps is one of the greatest restaurants in Arizona. I completely fell in love with the wings. The people who work at Zipps are very friendly too! Me and my mother go to Zipps at least once a week, for the past year at least. If you decide to go here, order the buffalo medium wings, you won't regret it! The only problem I have ever had in the many times I have been to Zipps is that I received the wrong wings, but the waitress was super nice about it and I received the correct order just a few minutes after. I definitely recommend Zipps to anyone who likes wings!"}
{"text":"Zips is a kick in the pants! I truly love the atmosphere, wings and beer specials. Don't get the small-little-girlie-pint beer, get the big mug, don't be a wimp. 
Whoo Hoooo!!! 
Can't beat this place. 
Fun will be had by all. 
Whoops! Almost forgot...there is a jukebox. 
;-)"}
{"text":"Tried the Big Zipp with high expectations, only to find that the sauce was lacking and they completely forgot the pickles mentioned in the description. The beef patty itself was bland, not to mention tasteless onion rings. Unusual that they don't even have a drink menu, either. Their only redeeming qualities are relatively good wings and location."}
{"text":"Food is ok and the daytime staff wasn't very friendly. I'll come back because I can watch non-local sports team games here. Full bar and tv is always a good thing!"}
{"text":"Normally I've had an \"average\" experience with this location, but a takeout order that I just picked up not an hour ago with my father was incredibly sub-par. I ordered a Tenderloin Caesar Salad, he ordered a turkey burger with fries.

We got back to the house and he took a bite of his fries and asked me to try one. I took a bite, they were rock hard. They were somewhere between a french fry and a potato chip, but more on the stale side. Not sure how that's even possible, but that's how it tasted.

I opened my salad up, and for a Tenderloin Caesar Salad, one of the main components was missing: the Caesar. There was absolutely no dressing on this salad. I looked through the bag, dug through the salad (I though maybe it was on the side somewhere?) but no, nothing. There was a 'decent' amount of beef on the salad, but nowhere near enough to warrant a $10 price, especially since there was maybe 5-6 large bites of lettuce to constitute the whole salad. This was incredibly disappointing, and $10 later, I'm still very hungry.

Zipps has won me over with their cheap prices and friendly service in the past, but with this experience I have nothing positive to say. I'll be back, but I certainly will be double checking take out orders and I can't see ever ordering a salad there again."}
{"text":"Raw chicken wing!!! I was served a raw chicken wings, and expected to pay for it. After having eaten half of the order, I bit into the 6th one and found blood. I wasn't going to risk eating the remaining 3. 

I brought it to the witness' attention, and it didn't seem to phase her. So I spoke with the manager. The manager also didn't seem too concerned about my health, and tried to convince me that the chicken wing was fully cooked. After our talk he offered to buy my dessert. But when the bill came, the wings and the dessert were on it. I mentioned it to the waitress, and she brought another bill... With the wings on it. I then spoke with the manager, and told him I wasn't going to pay for the wings... I didn't eat all of them, and I still might get sick from them. Didn't phase him. To be reasonable I offered to pay $4.00 ( $.80 per wing) and he didn't budge. 

My business, and that of my friends, doesn't seem to be too important to him. I paid for the wings and won't return. 

I wish you a healthy visit if you visit this place, but watch out for the chicken wings!"}
{"text":"We waited one hour for food and it wasnt even busy! They then sent out undercooked, slimy wings! Very gross."}
{"text":"Service was alright. Not sure I would come back. I also left with a bit of an upset stomach. Took forever to give us our check, we almost had to just ask the manager. Also, the ham in my salad was blue....I don't think that's normal."}
{"text":"WOOF!!  We were staying at the Hilton and they recommended Zips to us.  Being from CA, we have our fair share of wing places/ sports bars to choose from.   Upon entering it was pretty standard, loud, big screens, games on etc.....BUT there are two things that stood out to us......1) We were served by Serena who served us with a huge smile, knew her beers, and amazingly was happy to help us out...no attitude, no bs...just great service.  2) Her recommendations for golden style wings, sweet potato chips was spot on!  and by the way....ask for a side of the horse radish ranch for the wings.....much much better!  ( zips wings- golden style, Philly steak rolls and a mix base of sweet potato chips/ rings)

The next time we come to Phoenix....Zips will be on our list."}
{"text":"Great place. BUT horrible service. Although it was a game day Sunday and it was full they only came by 2times to check if we were ok and needed something and every time we asked for something we got a different server!!!"}
{"text":"4 stars... 

The good stuff: awesome wings, pizza, fries, and great place to watch The Game. Their beers are giant and their zipparitas are deeelicious"}
{"text":"Ok so we frequent the Chandler one at least once a week... we just love this place! The waitresses are always on point- it's really the Zipps with the most consistent service, by far. And the happy hour CANNOT be beat! $6 for 10 wings is a bargain!! And the zipparitas make my heart sing with joy. We love the fries and the onion rings, and loveee the option of changing it up with half and half orders! Yea baby.

An ode to Zipps:
O, Zipps, thy food and service are great
A good place for friends or a date
Of your quality there is nothing to hate
The best sports bar in all the state!"}
{"text":"Ordered a carry out that was completely botched. When we called to complain, the manager offered a refund. 

When we went to follow up to collect our refund ($14.56)  that manager was overruled and a refund was flatly denied and a credit offered. We called the corporate office to complain and to suggest that they honor the promise of one of their managers, but were flatly denied and offered a gift card/coupon of some sort. Since we have no intention of patronizing this establishment again, we politely refused their offer.
 
Mr. Josh Fletcher called us when we requested to speak to the owner. He introduced himself as \"Regional Manager\" and further denied our request for refund. Furthermore, when we suggested that we would complain to the BBB and post a review of our experience on Yelp!, he became belligerent and said they do not respond to social media!  

This was truly a unsatisfactory experience and the actions of this establishment are totally astounding in a negative way!"}
{"text":"We would go there for Happy Hour because it was the ONLY time the beer was reasonable. NOW they limit the domestic taps to Coors and Miller. No reason to go there any longer."}
{"text":"Outrageous prices on 22oz beers!!!  $8.50 each for Dos Equis is insane.  There are far better places to watch NFL games for more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We used to go to the Indian School one, but it was starting to get a bit shady.  Briefly: their focaccia is not focaccia, it's a wrap; beer glasses came smelly & unwashed and the main tv is quartered so the middle of the screen is obstructed.  Wings were good at Indian School - not so much here. Poor beer selection. Our server was nice. Not recommended, especially as there are now plenty of other options in the area."}
{"text":"Nice place for a beer or cocktail, watch out for the hot sauce it's  no joke get it on the side or your tonge will never forgive you lol,"}
{"text":"If I could do zero stars I would. We went during the open, it was very busy. We waited an hour for our food to then have the waitress told us it would be another thirty minutes. No manager walking around to apologize. No customer service. No apologies for messing up. We checked out and left. I have been coming here since it opened and I will never return. At least the jack in the box we got afterwards was quick and reliable."}
{"text":"Good food and drinks at a great value. Awesome staff, pleasant patio NOTE: listed as dog friendly, but they're not."}
{"text":"Back in the day, Zipps was the spot. Zipps would get a CHUNK of my paycheck weekly, minimum 3-4 times a week with the boys.  Zipps was not just a sports bar, but a great place that offered a variety of good beer & amazing, high calorie bar food attached to a great price.  Now the place is just a joke.  Zipps, unfortunately, fell right into the corporate-vortex of raising prices, declining food quality, and overpriced garbage beer that's falsely listed on the menu as \"premium or specialty.\"  You can literally go catch the game at any of the many breweries in the area of the Zipps in Gilbert, and get better food, beer, and service with a lower price tag. Next time you feel like hitting a sports bar for the game in the Gilbert/Chandler area,  don't find yourself at run-of-the-mill Zipps paying for overpriced, subpar food, when this area is now popping with 5-star places that aren't stuck in the corporate-vortex."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, and while it's in a good location for us, there's nothing special about this place. In fact, there's nothing really \"good\" about this place. The burgers and fries were super greasey, service was close to horrible, and the prices were on the high side for food and drinks. In addition to this, I know people that work at the Chase Bank in the same center, and they tell me cops love to pull over exiting patrons and many arrests have been made for DUI. (And might I add, it's never a good idea to drink and drive, and especially when you NOW know it's a place that's a target for DUI). Next time an untelevised game is on that I've got to see, I'll head elsewhere."}
{"text":"Cheap beer and pool. Good employees."}
{"text":"Zipps is what sports bars should be!  GREAT food, service and ambience.  This spot is tucked away in a little strip mall and from the outside looks like any other place.  Inside we were treated to our best meal on a recent trip to AZ.  

The service was great.  Our server made some great recommendations, was super friendly and Africa hot.  

The food was also just killer bar food.  We had nachos, burgers, fries, onion rings - perfect post 36 holes of golf in 110+ heat.  Everything was not just passable but truly delicious.  I had a \"Thousand Island\" burger that was better than In-N-Out.  The onion rings were some of the best I've ever had.  Even the nachos were on what seemed to be homemade chips.  Seriously this place is legit.  If Jones had been even half as great as this place it'd be hoppin.

AND they had the TDF on a couple of the TVs for us.  Love me some Zipps!"}
{"text":"Thank you for the golden wings BUT the PIZZA!!! Zaaamnnn,,  it was microwaved! NEVER GET THE PIZZA! i know its a sports bar and best wings place. But microwaving a PIZZA! BIG NO NO! Also when I told the server about the food she said just WALKED AWAY (NO EXAGGERATION) while i was still talking... Server - CARMELLA! Sorry but you're rude! Overall i gave it a 2 star just because the wings are great but server carries the place so i scored it low! Thank you and see you back for wings:)!"}
{"text":"Good food, not so good service. The waitresses need to SMILE! You would be amazed how much of a difference a simple SMILE would make! Been to other Zipps, they were much better."}
{"text":"I would come here for the fries alone. We always have excellent service here. It's been our favorite sports bar for years!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep trying this place.  The last time I was there for lunch they messed up my order and it took almost twenty minutes to fix and replace it. The bartender didn't even apologize for the mix up.  I decided to try again tonight and placed a to go order for two appetizers.  I was told 15-20 minutes and when I got there i wanted twenty minutes and still didn't get my food.   It should not take 45 minutes for pretzels and chicken Rolls. I asked them to just refund my money  and asked for a manager   When Tim came over he seemed bothered and basically said they were busy and nothing he could do.  I will not be back to any Zipps anytime soon 
The food was ok in the past but the service is awful. If I could give 0 stars I would. There are many other options that have better food and WAY better service"}
{"text":"Great wait staff, unique variety of appetizers, casual atmosphere, quick service. All locations are great, but this one is nice because it's pretty accessible no matter where in ahwatukee you're coming from"}
{"text":"Fun sports bar with lots going on.  We especially like the shuffleboard table. Always a fun positive environment.  The beer is big, cold and reasonable priced.  Food is good especially the chicken skewers.  I guess the little plastic baskets are part of their look but they are just awkward for anyone over 30 to eat out of.  
Last time we were in, we had the pleasure of being served by Jess  134.  It she really impressed us that evening.  She was calm and always available when we wanted something.  She never let our beverages sit and get warm on the bar.  Food was served quickly and our orders were correct.  One in the group has a food allergy so this is very important.     and all this on a Friday evening happy hour.  Great work.  Thanks again."}
{"text":"I spoke to the owner Phil and he was very apologetic and understanding.  I will defiantly be back and was glad to get a call back from him.  Its unfortunate that we had that 1 bad day but overall all of our other trips to Zipps have been awesome."}
{"text":"We were regulars at Zipps on 100th st in Scottsdale for years.  Loved the servers, got to know them and always had great service.  Bradly was the manager and loved him as well.  Service has gradually gotten worse.  The menu has changed.  My boys went last night with their friend and had three separate checks, the server was horrible, rude, didn't bring drinks so therefore she got zero tip!!  Last weekend my husband and I went for wings, it was dead in there but the food took forever.  Then we look back in the kitchen and one of the cooks was wiping the sweet off his head with a kitchen towel.  I don't think we will be back.  Sad because this use to be our favorite spot.  Defiantly has gone down hill! Don't even want to give 1 star."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is OK here, but after a few visits, the food and service kind of sucks. Was there yesterday and the food took a half an hour to arrive at our table. Maybe we had a lame waitress, but this is the second time I've had a lame waitress there. Nachos were just OK, and wings were really good."}
{"text":"Great service from the Bartenders.  They are so nice and attentive.  Make sure you order a big budlight with a floatie.  It's awesome.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood sports bar. Typical sports bar food, but top choices are definitely the black & blue burger, wings, and the BLT (more bacon on this than should be legal - best in town for sure).

Tons of TVs and all sports all day. Great bar and great service. They treat you like an old friend."}
{"text":"Here's the deal - you have to set proper expectations when you go to Zipps. The food and drinks are the highlight - great daily specials and my favorite bar food in The Valley. Service is totally variable, and I'll always choose to sit outside or at the bar. Love this location, but I would bump it up two stars if they closed for 7-10 days for a deep clean and some staff training."}
{"text":"Bad service. Side salad arrived with wilted lettuce. Burger arrived missing bacon. Server stopped coming by and never checked on us or refilled our drinks. Overall just not worth stopping by."}
{"text":"The most INCREDIBLE buffalo wings I have ever had. 

Husband orders golden medium. 
I opt for golden mild

Our new favorite is their fries but ordered EXTRA crispy!! 

We always have very attentive wait staff who are super accommodating! My hubbies only gripe is them not having a good AMBER ALE on the menu. Like Fat Tire or Four Peaks. 

Five stars!!! Mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"So many tvs here!  We ordered: buffalo wings (honey and regular), shrimp skewers, philly cheese steak rolls, turkey sandwich and fried fish and chips.  Everything was great except the fried fish - it was very bland. Good service and decent prices.  I'll def. come back for the wings and philly steak rolls."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat and kill some time. Great atmosphere and lots of TV's showing different types of sports. Wings are probably the best that I've had in the valley. Mozzarella sticks are also really good, just not tour normal mozzarella sticks. They're not breaded but wrapped in rice paper I believe. Almost like egg roll style. Still really good though!"}
{"text":"Update: we went back to Zips last Thursday after a couple subpar visits and a couple of months. We had a much better experience then we had in the past. Our service (waitress) was great, she checked on us often, was kind and cheerful. I wish I would have written down her name so I could share it. I raised my rating to a 3 because of this visit. 

We stopped by zips for happy hour. The beer was cold and the wings were very good as usual. Our waitress was fair at best, she only came by once after we ordered, had no personality and was kind of rude. Our check was wrong and we would have been overcharged if we had not looked at it. I'm sure we will go back sometime for the happy hour wings and beer."}
{"text":"So I wanted to leave a good review, I really did.  I would honestly give it negative stars if I could. I frequent the Zipps on Greenway and have always had impeccable service and great food. This Zipps totally fell short. We waited nearly an hour for our food and when it arrived, it was burned. When I mentioned it to the manager (Matt), he literally laughed in my face. Another manager came over and rectified it after Matt had his outburst. I love Zipps, it's beer, great food and environment. But this Zipps has the WORST management I've ever beheld."}
{"text":"The servers hostesses  and manager where the rudest people we had ever come about across  food was good ."}
{"text":"Come here if you'd like to wait 45 minutes for chips and salsa and another hour for your entrees! The kitchen can't keep up with crowds. They leave their servers out to dry. It happens every time too. As Trump would say, \"Very SAD!\". They don't seem too concerned to improve as this is a common theme on many other reviews. The other Zipps locations don't seem to have the same issues. Otherwise, it's good family atmosphere and has decent bar fare."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Unfortunately it took an hour and a half to get our food.  Need to increase their kitchen staff and efficiency on a Thursday night.  Tried to offer our table coupons for next visit. Not happening."}
{"text":"I come here every week. The last two time were really disappointing. Not sure what's going on and I hope they figure it out. I won't know as I won't be back"}
{"text":"This place is good for a sports bar around here but with the concrete floor, and no sound absorbing surfaces anywhere, it gets very loud and you often can barely here the people you are trying to talk to across the table.  Also while it is decent for a sports bar in AZ, it is no where near as good as sports bars in my home town of Milwaukee.  I just don't think anyone knows how to do a good sports bar in this town.  The food is pretty good but the service gets pretty slow when they get crowded."}
{"text":"I like this place if you're coming with more of a bar happy hour theme in mind.  Nice atmosphere,  usually nice service.  The food holds it back from 4 stars.  It's nothing special.  I wish they made a great gourmet style burger.  Then I'd be hooked on the place."}
{"text":"I was truly happy with the honey balsamic chicken salad last night.   Thank you, zipps sports bar, for making a salad for the after cal ripken baseball crowd that was flavorful and good for you!"}
{"text":"First off the staff here is amazing, and this place is always clean. The food here is so good and with the variety they offer there will be something for every one. This is there best location for sure!!"}
{"text":"The prices of the specials have went way up in the last 5 months - they probably needed to raise prices to print out all the new menu's for all the locations. In fact, I would barely call them specials anymore. Saving 50 cents on a slice of pizza and a bottle of beer - not so special. 

With that being said, the slices of pizza were pretty good and that was mostly due to the large amount of mushrooms on one slice. They say it is NY style, but only because it's cut in a triangle perhaps. The crust is crackery, not chewy like real NY pizza.
     Other annoying things on this visit included a baby screeching for at least 45 minutes, the bar manager changing the game I was watching twice (and once he even confirmed I was watching that game) and the usual batch of annoying millenials. All other prices on this bar food menu are up three bucks as well."}
{"text":"Wow tried this zipps location and again derive was subpar. Waitress messed up our orders one of my friends drinks was three quarters full. Two of us had to order from the bar multiple times. Unfortunately I think I am done with zipps for happy hour and will start looking for a new place to take our office for Friday happy hour. Thank you zipps for the good times but this relationship is over when it comes to company outings."}
{"text":"The best zipparitas and wings in town. The bartenders are personable and always introduce themselves. I love the vibe. The best sports bar in town."}
{"text":"It wasn't even busy when we came, and we didn't get even a hello by a server. We waited 10 minutes. A waitress walked by and saw me looking at her. A different table with a group of frat boys JUST got seated and someone was over there taking their drinks order. No one came to us. We left. No one acknowledged us on the way out.

Let me reiterate for you, Tiffany, it was NOT busy. It was practically empty, only 15% of the tables were being used."}
{"text":"We're so happy that Zipp's came to our neighborhood! I've been a fan for years and have been to every location. I love having a sports bar with really good food, even healthier alternatives, right in our area. I know this will be our go-to spot for any big games. 

Wings and wraps are delish. As is the cookie skillet.

Only downside is the patio can get really smoky - which is gross - cigs should be illegal, just saying..."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour and dinner. Lots of TV for the game top. Good food and service was great."}
{"text":"Came in last night for golden wings. The first time I had them they were perfect and I don't think it's been the same since. I always ask for extra crispy and never get extra crispy. The majority of the wings you get our drums and I prefer flats. So I always ask for extra crispy to make sure my drums are cooked through not soft. Salad comes in a basket with paper, once you add salad dressing now you have soggy paper! Stupid concept ! Also if you call in a to go order it can be hard to track someone down at the bar to retrieve the order for you. The hostess will say go to the bar but there is no designated spot for pick ups. May end up going back to wing stop although I come here because I love the golden wing flavor I just can't ever get extra crispy! Frustrating"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it less stars. The place smells like a septic tank, the food is terrible, and the service is a joke. Some of the worst, slowest service I've ever had. This place is just a no go. New sports bar on mill please."}
{"text":"Horrible!! Just horrible!! Filthy.. every table was dirty. So disappointed. Have been to all of the Zipps locations and they are all fab.. but do your self a favor and stay clear of he mill location! Bad service and super dirty."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night and glad we did. We're used to huge blaring big screens at other chain sports bars (which we also enjoy), but Zipps is more low key in a good way. Definitely a neighborhood-feel which is refreshing. My hubs, son, and I ordered burgers - the best we've had in years! The meat is seasoned to perfection. We chose the half/half of fries and onion rings which were outta this world. I love the flavor of slightly overdone fries and wasn't disappointed. The onion rings are obviously fresh and hand battered. All that for only a few bucks more than a fast food place - just $10. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time at this location and most Zipp's are pretty standard. This location had a small bar which was full, so I was forced to sit in the dining room to watch my hockey game. The game was already on several TV's (a sign of a good manager) and the waitress here was really nice. It was a night where the special was only $6.50 to dine in, but I wanted mine to go. Well, she just bought me a to-go box with my meal and it all worked out great. The foccaccia had pepper jack, sweet jalapeno and chicken - simple, but it worked well. The sweet potato chips though were a bit limp - choose a different side."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. From the food to the poor handling of my issue.

I should've known that when I walked in on a usually busy Monday Night Football night, that the place was nearly empty, I should've turned around and went home. Instead, I picked up an order and headed for home.

My order was pretty simple, chicken fingers, wings, and a cheeseburger for the little guy. The hamburger was raw. RAW! I'm not going to feed that to my child. My husband's O rings were nasty. The thin inedible part of the onion was battered and fried. Gross. Buffalo sauce tasted like they used Golden Wing sauce for the chicken fingers. 

The management is worse. Lavar, the manager, asked me to drive all the way from my home in Gilbert to the store so they could see the food and then maybe \"fix it.\" No way. Why should I have to get back into my car and drive all the way back to your restaurant when you made the mistake? The answer was \"that's just company protocol.\" Well, perhaps it's time to reconsider your \"protocols.\" 

As a compromise they asked me to send them pictures via email to determine whether a refund was due. I sent the pictures and an email depicting the details of the order. I have been offered a partial refund with my order, which is mostly fair. 

But what about my evening that was ruined? Or the extra money I had to spend to go out to get fast food to feed my children because they couldn't eat what Zipp's prepared?

They could've saved this customer with better quality control and customer service."}
{"text":"I do enjoy this location and their breakfast I had on sunday was very good. I had the B-E-L-T. However when I asked the server for lemons she forgot and then when I went to ask her again she treated me as if I was inconveniencing her - and she did this on numerous occasions throughout my stay on their patio during the Steelers game. I was disappointed in her service."}
{"text":"Good food but we're here too watch the Cardinals game and it's only on two screens. That's pretty pathetic considering we're going n Phoenix. Our waitress, Lexi, is great."}
{"text":"The main reason I visit Zipps is the wings. Best wings in town. Also, I strongly recommend ordering a floater. It's the draft beer of your choice with frozen margarita."}
{"text":"5/4/2018 I witnessed pure racism yesterday at this establishment. The customer service is poor so poor I dont even know how they have business. I will NEVER return or recommend this horrible place. You all should be ashamed of yourselves by how you treat people NO MATTER what their race may be.  I will be reaching out to the highest of management for the things I witnessed and only hope you un professional rasisit humans lose employment...."}
{"text":"I guess we get lucky each time we visit--which is twice a year when we travel to Scottsdale. Went last Saturday night and had very good service and great food. Love their burgers, mine cooked perfectly. One kid had a pizza and loved it, other kid had perfect burger as well. We'll be back on our next visit in December."}
{"text":"Fun sports bar for Sunday football.  Opens early and serves breakfast.  We enjoyed the reasonably priced drinks and all the different games on multiple TV's.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten numerous times at the Chandler location so expected this to be a similarly pleasant experience.

Boy was I wrong.

Let me start out by saying the service was rotten.

We walked over from Little League opening day, and my son was chastised for having a partially full Gatorade container left over from the game. We were told we had to hide it in my wife's purse, and the server would \"pretend she hadn't seen it.\"  At first I thought the server was getting after my wife for preparing my 4 month old's bottle.

Did I mention the service was rotten?

The food is what it is. Fairly standard sports bar food. The prices aren't overly expensive, nor are they very cheap.

My chicken fingers ended up being about an eight of an inch in diameter strip of chicken swallowed by two inches of thick, almost tempura like batter. It reminded me of something you'd get out of a fair booth.

My sweet potato chips were fine, except for the quarter inch deep pool of grease under them.

My wife's salad looked like it was left-over from another table from someone who couldn't finish all of theirs. We verified she got ripped off on the way out because two other ladies had the same dish, but had substantially more in their salad bowl.

Did I mention the service was rotten?

My son said his shrimp was bland and the BBQ sauce was too strong. This was unsolicited from a 12 year old.

After having been stuck in there without seeing our server for about 45 minutes, we finally tracked her down, asked for a doggy bag (literally this time) for left-overs.  Several minutes later she returned with the togo container.  

Did I mention the service was rotten?

But with no check.

Did I mention the service was rotten?

After another 20 minutes I gave up and hunted her down asking for the check. Paid and my son wanted a refill on his soda.  I already knew I wasn't going to wait for the server to return to our dimension from wherever it is she disappears to.  So I walked over to the bar where there were 4 bartenders, with my baby in her seat on my arm.

Did I mention the service was rotten?

After standing at the end of the bar for several minutes I realized poor service wasn't limited to just our server, but it appeared to be a store policy.

Did I mention the service was rotten?

So I walked back over to the waitress station and refilled it myself.

Did I mention the service was rotten?

Wasted almost 2 hours of my life in there, and my wife was hungry within two hours of getting home.

In case I forgot to mention it, the service was rotten."}
{"text":"Been here a lot lately and really don't have any complaints. Enjoy the atmosphere and the food. Never had a problem."}
{"text":"Sad that an establishment will seat you and your dog out on their patio and provide a menu.    Then they come tell you know dogs are allowed.  No wonder the patio and restaurant is empty.  Instead of being a neighborhood friendly restaurant, they're an envy sports bar with mediocre at best food."}
{"text":"Nice place to drink some beer and enjoy extremely hot wings. Seriously, their very hot wings don't lie. Also one of my favorite bars to head over to and play shuffleboard at. The one down side to the shuffleboard table is that it's very close to the high top tables in the bar. If someone is sitting at the high tops you will need to walk around the front of them to get to the other side of the table. Don't let that turn you away however, this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! Went in and asked if we could sit outside to have dinner, drinks and watch the World Series game and they said no problem.  We waited for awhile and no one came out to wait on us, we went back inside to see what was going on and to ask if they could put the game on and they again said yes. 10-15 later still no service, when we got up and left 3 employees watched us leave and said nothing. Won't be going back and making sure our friends don't either!"}
{"text":"Wings are great and have some good happy hour specials. Host was quiet and rude. Service was slow and multiple times waitress walked away while we were asking for something.Onion rings and fried were soggy and cold. Don't order them the breading is light and not like a normal onion ring. They only person doing a good job was the busser he Immediately came to table to remove baskets and trash. When the bill came there was a $.50 charge for extra wing sauce that we got on the side because the waitress warned us about the extra hot. If you say \"wings are non-refundable\", you shouldn't charge for a side of the extra hot sauce because you talk the customers out of extra hot.... They were not that hot."}
{"text":"Our party of 6 sat outside and waited quite awhile to get waited and served.  Fish tacos were tasty but fried and wrapped like a burrito with just enough tartar sauce.  Tuna sandwich on sourdough bread, wish it wasn't toasted as it got hard.  Burgers were good.  Lunch took an hour and a half and when the waitress brought our change back, she had already kept the coin from each bill."}
{"text":"Mike, I don't want or need your flea bitten mutt with mange next to me on the patio ! Good for Zipps saying enough to fake therapy dogs on the patio. I love dogs I'm a freakin wolf and  dogs descend from me. I am Canis Lupus! Not sure what's up with all the negativity with this place. Big 32 ounce cold ass beers for $7 what is there to bitch about ? Great service, friendly efficient staff and damn good,  hot wings! TV monitors surround you. Pool table available and video games. Kid friendly too. 

Great place to hang and chill."}
{"text":"I have been to Zipps twice now. Both times to watch World Cup games with my husband and son. Though service was a bit slow (due to the massive amount of sports fans) it was worth the wait. The server was cute and kind. 

We all ordered hamburgers. We all agreed that it was a good burger and my son said it was the second best burger he has ever had. The sides are huge that accompany the burger and we were left stuffed with a bill barely over $20. Amazing!!!

The games were a bit long and the server did not seem like she cared if we sat and watch the rest of the game. 

Love."}
{"text":"The wall of TV's on both sides of the bar distinquish this Zipps from many others in the area. The zipparita did not taste as good as other locations though. On this day it wasn't too crowded yet at 4pm. The bartender was new and the manager turned on my Yankees game as requested. Much better place to probably watch weekend football. They should at least alter the menu at some locations to reflect ASU or Scottsdale, but it's the same specials and same menu everywhere."}
{"text":"The food is great. Have the honey golden wings, medium. You won't be sorry. Best wings ever. I've since moved to CA and miss Zipps wings the most.

I can't eat wings from anywhere else. I won't eat wings from anywhere else.

One more thing. At the time of this writing half the review s(2 of 4) are from people who don't live in AZ. That's how good the wings are.

Order the HONEY GOLDEN WINGS, medium hot. They're the best."}
{"text":"Very surprised about the huge price increase, I read that it's about the new minimum wage increase. Servers were not affected by Prop 206, so it must be just the kitchen staff. This Zipp's is in my neighborhood, and we were regulars for the wings. But they are NOT $11.00 dollar wings. I'll be taking my business elsewhere - so many new places in Gilbert are opening up! Really disappointed."}
{"text":"The Green Bay chili was awesome!!! Chips and salsa was really good.  The rest was not so great. Probably won't be back.  Waitress was very nice but my order was messed up, took way too long to get it fixed."}
{"text":"Went here to watch the Mizzou football game while in Tempe. The bar was big and even had outdoor the sitting. The food was just ok. Like most bar foods. They do have great drink specials when we were there. The prices for the food was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Tried to come in for an MLS game LA Galaxy vs. Seattle Sounders on Sunday afternoon. The sign said \"Please seat yourself\" so we did. The A/C was blasting where our table was so we moved to another table on the other side of the dining room. 

Food: We weren't really hungry so we ordered a 32 oz. beer, two baskets of muchies: one fries and one onion rings. The food came out fairly quickly. However, I was so disappointed with the quality of our orders. How can you mess up on fries and onion rings? Onion rings were hard and tasted frozen. On the other hand, our fries were soggy and tasteless. 
An hour later, I ordered some chicken wings hoping it would be better. And they were! However, they are still pretty mediocre.

Service: our waitress was attentive and checked on us often. I told her I don't like buffalo flavor on my wings so she brought out my wings naked with different sauces on the side. 

One really annoying thing I had to say was the music they were playing. Being a sports bar, their customers will most likely come in to watch a sport game. Yet they were playing this playlist varied from alternatives, classic rock to pop, country, and edm (?!) It was distracting and seriously killed the mood. Imagine watching an action movie with classical instruments playing very softly in the background... 

Overall, microwave, frozen food. Good service. Weird taste of music. I don't think I'll come back on my own. However, maybe it's just this location since I had better experience with Zipps in Tempe. 

P/s: they have a really random beer menu, yet no Sam Adams."}
{"text":"Burgers or wings are the way to go.  Fries are not my favorite.  Has decent daily specials.  Good for kids and we get to enjoy the game too!"}
{"text":"Some things are so tasty that when you go to a restaurant, you simply must get them, no matter what.  The onion rings at Zipps with the sweet jalapeno goo fall into that category.  If you go to Zipps, you can get really good burgers, foccacias (really they're wraps) and some damn good french fries.

They serve beer for cheap and have a bunch of TVs.  This particular location has a savvy young waiter named Danny who kept us happy in terms of drinks, shots, etc.  Well done, sir.

The greek salad is mediocre, I would pass, especially since you don't go there for the salads.  You go there for the... say it with me...

onion rings with sweet jalapeno goo!  trust me."}
{"text":"Great kicked back location. We usually hit it at least once a week from our office for lunch. Fantastic Fish & Chips. Like fish not too deep fried with a heavy coating. The sweet potato chips are quite good, only complaint, no cole slaw...not that you need it with this hearty helping...but it is a routine I have gotten used to as a fish & chips fan. Burgers are disappointing as they are just average for the price. Good beer selection & the hot wings are fantastic! I haven't been on the weekend, but during the week it can become a busy place at lunch. Lots of TV's that make it look like a great place to catch the game."}
{"text":"If you want a big cheap beer, a tired menu and below average service, this is your place. If you deviate one smidgen from the menu (hold the pickles please) you are out of luck.  Their staff seems like they all have the attention span of a nat.  This is OK when you are serving day drinkers who get lost in their huge beer, but for other people who still have to work for a living and are generally short on time find another restaurant. and hey.  An apology would be nice for having to recook my meal (add 15 minutes here) after I asked 3 times in different ways to hold the pickles when I was ordering to drive the point home. The managers are average and linger over half the time to see if the order was served correctly the second time around and wait around like a bellboy for a pat on the back for finally getting it served right.  So only have a few bucks in your pocket for a huge cheap draft beer and an entire afternoon to waste...?  Zipps should be at the top of your list!!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to catch a bball game. I usually goto Four Peaks but this was closer and less busy. The atmosphere is great with pool tables in the bar and flat screens on every wall. The service was great! Drinks were on the cheap after 8pm every day with a revolving selection of  food specials. I decided to order the fish and chips since I was craving them. The fries were soggy and not very good. I was hoping for thicker cut and crispy. The onion rings were very good though, light and crispy. Fish had a little too much batter but was still crispy. Not the best fish and chips but still hit the spot for me, especially with a nice pint. I really like the neighborhood feel to this place and I would definitely come back for drinks. I'd try the green chile cheese burger next time, I've heard good things!"}
{"text":"This sports pub isn't too bad; it isn't that great either. This establishment is fairly run-of-the-mill. There is no distinct architecture or atmosphere to it, and the service is OK. Really, if you have somewhere else to go, I recommend that. The food seemed well cooked and reasonably priced. The prices were average for the area.

I would come here again because it was convenient or because I wanted to watch a game. I would not travel to this place unless it was to meet someone else."}
{"text":"Love this place! My boyfriend and I eat at this location a minimum of twice a week, as embarrassing as that is. (We live closer to another location but we fell in love with the servers, manager and food at FLW location!) We eat the same meal and get the same drinks- it never gets old. One visit was during a huge basketball game and the place was packed... the service was a tad bit slow, nothing to even complain about, BUT the manager comped out beers and gave us $10 Zipps dollars for our next visit. We were shocked it was so kind. Thanks to this location and the staff!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here so many times and my biggest complaint has to be- SERVICE! 

Yesterday topped my last few experiences which weren't that awful but, yikes. 

I went with two girls from work as a going away lunch and at lunch it is \"seat yourself.\" As they were very busy, we picked a table in the main dining room and waited. And waited, we were finally greeted by a great manager who took our drink and appetizer orders. The only time we saw our waitress was to deliver some food.

We jokingly asked if we could tip the manager, but we meant it. Then my friends lunch came, a club foccacia came/ and she bit into paper. Like a huge roll of paper that had been wrapped around the ham, and they didn't even notice. 

I hailed another server who I told and she just nodded knowingly, like it happens all the time, grabbed the food, and said \"I will have them remake it.\" What if she wanted something else? Why didn't you take it off the check? Why no apology?

She did go tell that same manager who came over and apologiZed profusely, but my friend barely touched the \"remade\" one which was the same dish just with the ham taken out.

I have to say I normally love Zipps but this location has never impressed me."}
{"text":"We will NEVER EVER visit this establishment ( NOT this location) ever again. Blacks are not allowed to do what White people do and you proved that to me by the way management spoke to us and how we were treated on May 5, 2018. You should be ashamed of yourselves. I've never been treated so disrespectful in my life. Hope this location go out of business, you deserve that and this TRUE review that I am posting for all others to see. Next one is going to the BBB!"}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER. Ordered a buffalo chicken salad and when I bit into my chicken it was rubbery and raw. I then told the waitress my issue and she took the plate from me. She then brought back my same plate and told me to pick the gross chicken off of my salad and just eat the salad, and that she would only charge me for the salad. After arguing with the manager I was able to get the salad taken off my tab. However, the next day I had to leave work due to FOOD POISONING, WONDER WHERE I GOT IT FROM."}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten at Zipps many times.  Today my husband and I went in at 11:15am. We were the 1st customers in.  We ordered 2 Bloody Mary's, 1 with extra olives, an order of wings, 1 house salad and a club sandwich.  Our Bloody Mary's were soooo bad. About the most generic I've ever had.  I was also told by my server that she had been told by the manager at the bar that I could not have extra olives as they were expensive and I would be charged $.75 for every 3 olives in my Bloody Mary.  About 20 minutes later my husband's house salad came. 10 minutes after that my sandwich came....then we stared at our food for another 20 minutes until the wings came out.  Our server was great. Very professional and sweet.  Unfortunately, the kitchen and bar were not making life easy for the servers. So...I'd say don't EVER get a Bloody Mary from Zipps unless you BYOO (bring your own olives.) And don't expect to get your food in a timely manner or to get your orders together. Zipp's....the food was pretty good. But the experience was long and drawn out.  And I've never ever EVER been charged for olives.  I've actually many times had a bar tender send us an entire glass of olives.  Ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"I just keep coming back, love this place. Great service and food. It's a loud atmosphere but it is a sports bar after all. Don't expect a relaxing family atmosphere. It's a fun place to hang out, watch a game and chow down on all kinds great food and drinks. Staff is always smiling and very attentive."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and other daily specials.  All the locations are pretty much the same.  The cookie pizza for desert is the best!"}
{"text":"Zipps have great happy hour specials all day. Great atmosphere to watch a game and the service is great! The only issue I have is that they do not play the audio for the games all the time."}
{"text":"Pros: perfect spot to catch any game, fun atmosphere, decent food, and friendly staff

Cons: very loud atmosphere, dark inside, and greasy food

Bottom Line is that they are great at what they claim to be - a large sports bar catering to families and locals."}
{"text":"We have been going to this Zipps for many years. We've have multiple friends that are servers and bartenders that know us by name. Unfortunately over the past year or so the service and the food level has seriously declined. We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon to watch some of the NCAA basketball. The restaurant wasn't anywhere close to halfway full and it took extremely long to get our drinks and or food taken care of. The bad part about the whole experience was the The french fries and onion rings weren't even freshly fried.  We used to love coming here but after this experience we started trying to think of other places to go while we were still in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was decent. nothing to be over excited about or anything to go out of the way for. it has a GREAT atmosphere for sports, think of it as a Buffalo Wild Wings style food restaurant with more food options less beer selection. service is less the par. the blonde hair blue eyed server i had couldn't seem to get the order right. (a salad sub blue cheese for goat cheese and dressing on the side and chicken sticks with golden buff sauce) which really shouldn't be that hard. i've been a server before for many years didn't have that problem, and she seemed inadequate or at least flustered to say the least. She didnt' seem like she wanted to be at her job. I'd go back, just request a different waitress."}
{"text":"Took 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive and over an hour for our food which was cold and incorrect. Some of our order included chicken wings (they were old and cold upon arrival) , hot dog with nothing on it (asked for everything as listed on menu), salad with no dressing , room 15 minutes to get ranch, chicken fingers with the wrong side and imo bbq sauce. I'm missing a few. Drink refills were not asked or attended to. It took 21/2 hours for our service from start to finish and with all the errors. Pretty likely we won't return."}
{"text":"I always forget to review places that I frequent when they are just part of the neighborhood ... so, here goes!  I've been going to Zipps Sports Grill since it first opened at this location.  The food and drink is solid for a bar/chain restaurant, and the teens seem to like it a lot.  It's not my first choice for a sports bar, but if there's a game on, and we're hungry, it's usually where we end up (if I'm just thirsty, I'll head to another sports bar for viewing!!).

The burgers are all very good, and you can order any with turkey instead of beef for a nice twist (the green-chili turkey burger is a great combo).  Their focacia wraps are very popular too (buffalo chicken wrap seems to be a favorite).

It can get busy at times, with pretty good waits for a table, but I tend to frequent at more off times when they don't even need a hostess, making it easier.  Lot's of youth sports teams end up grabbing food there after games and practices, adding to the noise and crowd (but, this means it's pretty family friendly too!)."}
{"text":"Katie, Bri, Markie, Cookie, Savanna, John and Tara all amazing bartenders!! Top quality service!!! Awesome place to stop in and have a drink or go to watch a game!! Always great service when sitting at the bar!"}
{"text":"Ive come to this location cuz its convenient I live 5 min away and out of the 4 times I came here the service is fucking terrible and always ask myself why do I comeback. Sad part is I get different servers everytime I go and seems like ALL of em hate being there. If youre the type that cares about service, this is the last place you wanna be. You literally waste 20-30 minutes everytime and let me also say it wasnt busy AT ALL and service still sucks balls."}
{"text":"Not only the best wings in the state - best wings I've had anywhere! Love the Golden Medium wings!! The chicken skewers are delicious with a little breading and flavor to boot! Yummy, yummy! Gets 4 starts for two reasons. First, their (Gilbert location) water is terrible!!!  Management, please don't offer hose water and act like it's normal for patrons to buy your Zipps/ Goldies bottled water.  I hate that. I don't want soda, just (acceptable) water. *Please* invest in a filtered water set up!  Second, I visited the Gilbert location during the summer and the AC wasn't working.  There wasn't a courtesy sign hung at the entrance to let patrons know and they could've at least paid for our sodas or a drink since we were sitting in an enclosed hot restaurant.   Yes, it was our choice to dine there but we were already there with our friends and kids. It was a hot environment and the manager was a bit short with us when we asked about the AC.  Otherwise, I love this restaurant.  The Gilbert location is the best; great servers and not too hard to get a table. Didn't like how obnoxiously loud the Chandler location (Ocotillo & AZ Ave.) was the last 2 times I've visited."}
{"text":"Mediocre everything: food, drinks, beer selections, services, portion, prices, etc. The only a-okay things they offer here are the zipparitas and a cool tv system setup that can be combined together to make a big screen for the game. 
And this mediocre level is consistent throughout their chains from Gilbert location to Mill Ave. 

I really hope you will try to do better in the near future, Zipps."}
{"text":"no atmosphere. average food. prices aren't great. service usually subpar and hard to get good games on unless they're on ESPN or it's the super bowl."}
{"text":"Bottom Line: I wasn't prepared to be impressed - but I was wrong.

Was in AZ on a recent layover and drove to the area that the hotel told us was the fun place to be.  We walked up and done the street and settled on here for something to eat.

We were on a little tourist strip so I expected mediocre food at an inflated price.

I had:

A Firecracker Margarita - small but tasty
A Black & Blue Burger w Bacon - Delicious! Perfectly cooked and very tasty
I ordered half fries and half onion rings with my burger - thanks to the waitress for telling us that this was an option when I hesitated on choosing
A Pint of Ranger

A Runner brought our food and my order only had fries.  Our waitress came right behind the runner to check on our order and when I told her I was missing my rings she very quickly had a whole basket of hot rings out and on the table.  Good job!

I enjoyed my entire meal and the best part was it came to $19.99 which I think was a great deal for a specialty drink, a pint of beer, a burger and a side.

Bottom Line:  If I'm nearby again, I'll walk around that area and be sure to stop there when I get hungry and/or thirsty."}
{"text":"Amazing Service by Sami A! Every time I come in here we request to sit in her section. So sweet and nice and great service!! You have a great server on your hands Zipps!"}
{"text":"I entered Zipps on Arizona Ave. at appx 1:20 p.m. on 11/20/17 and requested a glass of Cabernet. The waitress was very nice. There were three other people at the opposite end of the bar from me talking. They were seated in from on one of 4 t.v.'s I was seated at the opposite end of the bar in front of a t.v. I asked if I could have the stationed changed to either Fox News or Fox business News. The waitress said would ask the manager. She came back and told me he said no. I asked to speak to him. He came out and said if he had to change it for me he would have to change it for everyone, I said there are only 3 other people here. He said and rather rudely he wouldn't. I said fineI'll take my business elsewhere. He said the waitress already poured my glass of wine and I would have to pay for it. I said I hadn't touched it and wouldn't pay for something I didn't touch. He said ok I'm going to call the police.  He walked to the back I believe his name was Andrew. I paid the waitress and left. Well I've been a Police Officer. I can tell you this is a nuisance call by a guy who is short in stature and wants to make up for it in his own little man syndrome way. I will never set foot in this establishment again and will continue to tell this story as long as I live here. This is a terrible way to do business and as nice as the waitress was the surly manager certainly ruined that encounter. Please anyone who doesn't believe this story feel free to touch base with me. This manager has NO BUSINESS running a business. I can guarantee you he will lose a lot of customers over this as I know many people."}
{"text":"Went there just for a few drinks, the asu game happened to be on,  we don't keep up with football and had no idea. We understand you are crowded, our drinks took a little longer but hey, we only got one and our server was very attentive. However, as we were almost done with our beer, my friend asked me to take a seat really quick because I had an injured ankle and when we sat down literally for 2 mins (even tho we know someone would come and ask us to allow them to clean the table, we just needed a seat for a min) Abby came and rudely began to go on about her 6 page waiting list with attitude asking us to leave the table. Unnecessary to be rude, I have been in the industry for years, that's not the way you speak to a customer. Maybe you should train some off your staff a little better on etiquette."}
{"text":"Nice place to go out for drinks and hang out with friends , but the food was horrible. If you are hungry I will not recommend this place to eat."}
{"text":"Not too impressed... Service was slow and it was a big basketball college game night - two rivalries: ASU vs. UofA and Duke vs. UNC. Server barely came around and took a break right when the games were ending, so we had to wait 35 minutes (not exaggerated) for her to come back. To top it off, drinks were pretty weak. On the plus, Caesar salad was tasty, they have shuffleboard for $1 and a pool table and lots of TVs."}
{"text":"I hit this place for lunch, a LOT. I can't keep my boy co-workers away from it. They're lured in by the greasy double cheeseburgers with mesquite bbq sauce and bacon and blue cheese, and captivated by the onion rings and french fries. I am too... I should probably save some calories and JUST order french fries and onion rings when I go. 

Good greasy food and - my co-workers couldn't help but notice - waitresses are very easy on the eyes :)"}
{"text":"I love coming here and always having someone greet me.

Their pizza is perfect for a hot summer day.

And the bartenders make the best summer drinks"}
{"text":"Zipps is almost always on happy hour! They have happy hour Mon- Fri from 3-7pm and 8pm to close, and Saturday and Sunday from 11am-4pm and 8pm to close. 

Don't be fooled by the Zipparitas, they have a 3 limit for a reason! They're my go to drink! They almost always have 32oz domestic drafts for $5! 

It's a great place to watch the game and relax on the outdoor patio. 

I'll be honest, I mostly come here for the drinks and have only had their wings and fries. The fries were soggy but wings hit the spot."}
{"text":"I like Zipps. Let's make that clear. Their happy hour specials are the best in town. 

But my experience at the Gilbert Zipps Saturday was extremely frustrating. 

The food was horrendous; without a doubt the worst meal I've had in a long time. Both my wife and I ordered fries, which were soggy, cold, and greasy. I actually had the \"half and half,\" but only received three onion rings. My hamburger was a disaster. The bun was cheap--like something you'd get with a Fry's brand bun. The patty was tasteless and sloppy and covered head-to-toe in sauce.

I'd like to return to Zipps for the banging happy hour. But I will not order their good again."}
{"text":"Great beer on tap, the service is great, and the wings are amazing!!! Love their sauce!"}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place really. 
Pros: Good prices and selection on food and drinks for happy hour. 
Cons: Service is average, when we did see our server she was nice and friendly...that is the few times we saw her. 
Another con, the food was average. The wing sauce was good but the pizza slices seemed like they were sitting under a warmer just a tad too long
Overall a decent place to catch happy hour and a game."}
{"text":"We are here a couple weeks ago. It was a great experience! Our server was super polite and accommodating considering we had a toddler with us. 

The atmosphere was fun and laid back. TV's going everywhere with all of the live sports action. 

We tried their Green Bay chili.... Awesome! Just like a great quality traditional chili. Their wings were off the hook! Next time we are trying the zipp's burger. 

Check it out!"}
{"text":"It is a great disappointment that this Zipps has gone so far down hill. Me and my wife used to come to Zipps almost every week. Now in the past couple of months our visits are less and less due to poor service, lousy drinks, and rude service. We most likely will never return because of our experience this morning. We are football fans and wanted to watch our team and eat breakfast in which they advertised was going on at the time. When we arrived we sat at a table where the only tv that our game was showing the game. So here is what happened, we were going to order breakfast was told they stopped breakfast. Kind of funny the menus they brought us said breakfast at 9:00am on Sundays. So we ordered two mamosa's. We received them and wow had to be 2 ounces maybe and there was no orange juice in them and they tasted horible. My wife saw a waiter coming And was going to ask for more orange juice. What we got was can you please move out of yours seats and move somewhere else. That pretty well did it. So no breakfast, horrible drinks and you can't watch your team play. Goodbye we paid and left. I mentioned we most likely will no return, wrong we will never return."}
{"text":"I am a frequent visitor, but I am getting a little upset over requesting extra crispy wings and not receiving what I am paying for."}
{"text":"So if you're looking for decent late night bar eats, this is your place! Just remember it's bar food- but really good bar food! They have different late  specials (food and drink) every night which can turn this spot into a great watering hole. I am such a foodie and have been exploring the valley for years but this place is my favorite for consistent late night food paired with great late night specials! Also- great service at the bar-Missy is amazing but Rachel and Sarah are wonderful as well! Service standards are a large part of my consideration and they have never made me feel anything but welcome and cared for."}
{"text":"We ordered a large pizza with mushroom and pepperoni it came to the table with soggy undone crust, nasty, it may have been good if it had been cooked properly, we asked for our waitress and she was to busy busing tables to help us, we asked for a manager and he looked at the pizza and agreed soggy undone crust, we are going to try the wings, the wings were good, nothing special what you would expect from a little hole in the wall dive bar, but not what you would expect from a place as big as zips, our waitress not impressed she did not seem much interested in helping us"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. Waited 50 minutes for two slices of pizza had to get it to go. The waitress was polite but failed to tell us about a backed up kitchen. In summary this Zipps is not capable of handling a lunch rush. Avoid this location for lunch. You will never make it of here within an hour."}
{"text":"I go to zips every Friday and spend over 50$ every time for the last two years. Tonight I had a bone in my food that shouldn't have been there ! This is the craziest story ever. I got the pepper jack focaccia. The bone was the size of a tooth pick, seriously no joke, I asked to send it back for a new one. The assistant manger mike came over and said he would make it right. He came back with two options. Option number 1 a five dollar coupon but I still have to pay for the sandwich I sent back. Option 2 he could take it off my bill but if I want a new one he would charge me for it. WTF! Seriously I almost ate a bone the size of a TOOTHPICK !!! I asked to talk to a different manager, so Alexis came over and said sorry sir this all I can do. All I wanted was for them to take it off my bill and give me one that had no bones for free. I could of choked on this bone and died."}
{"text":"So happy there is a Zipps near me now! They've been open for 5 days and are PACKED. We got right in on a Friday night around 6:45, our server was Ashley M. and she greeted us right away and put in all of our food before happy hour ended at 7. We were told that the food wait-time was about 45 minutes, but everything came out way faster than that. We just got wings and some chips and salsa, but the wings were perfect like the other Zipps locations. Ashley was always present and took good care of us. Definitely recommend to anyone craving some sports bar food (and cheap drinks)."}
{"text":"Over the years of going to Zipps, I was under the assumption that they had it down when it came to burgers. Now I totally get that they are a bar and grill. But after my experience that the Frank Lloyd Wright restaurant today I might rethink going back. I got there at about lunch time and they were not that busy at all. Now I know why. And my wife and I have been going to Zipps for years! It took the wait staff 5 mins. to take my drink. Another 10 to bring it back and take my Appetizer order. 15 mins to get it. Which by the way the chicken wraps are always good. But that is where it stopped. The waitress got my order wrong. She got the burger right but I did not ask for half and half and then tried to convince me I had. She took it back and then brought me back this HUGE pile of fries after taking the onion rings out. Then every french fry was cold. I am not talking luke warm, cold. And from the people who I thought made the best burgers in town!! These 2 hockey pucks they called hamburgers came out that were just worn out dry and over cooked a TON! And the bun it came on must have been sitting on the grill for an hour. It tasted way to crispy and stale. I am not sure at all, I would go back nor would I recommend it to any of my family or friends who come to town. Just another chain of restaurants who expand and then just start screwing up the food and do not care any more..............."}
{"text":"Showed up early to grab 2 tables for a group of 8 and they wouldn't let me move them until everyone was there. Tried to order a pitcher and the same thing, had to wait. (My group showed up in 10min later but missed the table and had to move outside). On top of all that, it's 50cents for ranch."}
{"text":"**UPDATE**  Since trying Zipps and eating the horrendous nachos, I visited another location and had the burger, which was pretty good. This past week my husband again asked to meet at Zipps and I met him.  He again ordered wings. I ordered a turkey sandwich which I asked to be \"reubenized\" which they'd take off the original toppings and instead add sauerkraut and 1000 island dressing.  (It's on the menu!) For my side I asked for sweet potato fries. 

I guess I assumed it would be on a bun instead of between two slices of toast.  It was a pretty big lump of sliced turkey, which in that way they delivered, but I was just not excited about it. It was basically something I could have made better at home.  Dont' ever order chips at a bar unless you know they make them (like Oreganos). I could tell that they were at the bottom of the bag with my sweet potato chips.  I literally ate maybe 10 full chips and the rest were crumbs. (Seen in my photo) IF I  return, I'm only getting the wings or a burger."}
{"text":"Portions seem smaller, especially the fries.   The music...what is the purpose of having a Touch Tunes jukebox if you aren't going to let you patrons play the music they want.  Not everyone likes what the manager likes....Hard Hip-hop"}
{"text":"I love to give 5 star reviews because they're fun and exciting and inspiring and bring back thoughts of delicious eats, treats, cocktails and an experience to remember. Sadly our experience was not 5 star. 

So to be fair, let me start with what was great about it the first 30 minutes! Hubby and I sat at the bar area after picking up our vehicle form an oil change and wanting to pass some time during rush hour traffic home around 6pm ish on a Thursday. This is now 2 weeks ago but I can't stop thinking about it. We were instantly greeted by a lovely waitress who was attentive and had a great personality and shared the happy hour specials etc. Hubby got his favorite golden wings and I got the turkey chili which was delicious! I've never had turkey chili and it was like pulled pork, seasoned, a bit spicy.. YUM YUM! We were happy they had our beverage of choice and even though not on happy hour was very reasonably priced. We had frequented the Zipps on McLintock & Ray as well as one in Chandler on Arizona and always had a great experience.

I saw a touch tunes and thought.. oooohh how fun, let me play a few jams. I was surprised they had country music blocked which is odd for Arizona, but anyhoo I proceeded to play some of our favorite 70's funk songs from the Gap Band then moved on to 80's Annie Lenox Sweet Dreams, etc. The radio playing switched from radio per bar setting to the juke box. I started with $5, then added $15 more and we were jamming. I started playing some party songs like It's getting hot in here by Nelly. Well, it is Arizona... it does get hot. The happy hour crowd was loving it! People were dancing in their seats by 645 and suddenly at 7pm it was like hearing a record scratch in my mind, the song was cut mid play and the music switched to the bar's radio station.

Having $15 still left in the touch tunes I was worried and flagged our lovely waitress down. She came over and attentively heard our concern and stated that people were really enjoying the tunes and she would see what happened and fix it. She disappeared, came back, said they were working on it. Then the Manager came by with a blank look on his face asking what the problem was. I advised him that I had a ton more songs and $15 in the juke box left to play and the music was turned off. He proceeded to tell a fib to keep things calm and tell me that they turn the music off after happy hour which is at 701pm. This raised my blood pressure as I advised him that a sign, warning, announcement would be nice as patrons add money to it from their phones and I'd have no way of knowing that. I asked for my $15 back. 

Then he changed the story to \"a table complained about the music being inappropriate\" so he decided to turn it off. Higher blood pressure still I asked why Country music was blocked but not R&B songs they didn't like which had no bad words in them at all? No answer. He asked me twice how many of my $15 songs had played to which I responded 4. He left and returned with $15 in cash.  The solution was appropriate to return our funds but it still baffles me why a sports bar would allow a juke box if they don't want people to make their selections or if they want to control their environment to that extent. Why Rhianna songs were ok from the  Radio but not others? Why a family would bring say their young kids to a sports bar during happy hour and then be upset with song selections. All of this coupled with the state of things and us being an interracial couple made us feel a bit ugly about the whole experience. It was unpleasant and ruined our evening and we thought about it for days, now weeks. How bothersome that is. To be just \"declined\", denied, your choice of music is too provocative somehow... then don't give people a choice or filter the songs better to have only happy sugary pop songs played by non-flavored singers.
Love the wings, love the wait staff, love the happy hour prices, loved the vibe until it was cut.
Won't return for more disappointment. Sorry Zipps. You failed us and all the people having a great time along with us chair dancing. Perhaps you can open as an Applebees? Forget the sports bar part. 

Good luck. God speed."}
{"text":"When a place is \"known\" for their burger that's what you get.  I learned my lesson after visiting another Zipps location.  This time, I ordered the peanut butter burger, my newest obsession.  The burger has two patties, and a glob of PB, and if you want jelly, you've got to add it yourself.  Not bad, but not my favorite PB burger I've had."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this zipps! We come every single weekend, and we have been coming here every single weekend since May 2014. We love coming here on our date night or coming here with our daughter. All the servers are always so nice to our daughter.  The food is incredible and always is. We get the same food every time we go and it's always absolutely perfect. It actually makes my mouth water thinking about it as I type this. Management is always around and always checks in.The staff is the number one reason that we keep going to this location weekly.  And the food being incredibly delicious doesn't hurt either 
 This location definitely deserves to be recognized!"}
{"text":"First time. Came to watch a game on big screen. Staff worked hard to accommodate us. Lots of screens had to show lots of games of different kinds. Our waitress was very good: attentive, helpful, kept track of our needs and the place was busy.   Happy hour wine was terrible but for $2.75 I didn't expect much. Later I discovered that if you pay for it you can get good wine. I had fish and chips  the fries were great and the fish ok. My wife got fish tacos which was really a fish wrap. It was ok but not memorable. The chips and salsa were not great. Friends had burgers which they enjoyed. onion  rings were good. We shared a couple of desserts which were good but by then I was full. In the last few weeks we have tried different places to watch college football. This was the best."}
{"text":"Standard sports bar if you're looking to catch your favorite game. They do have the pac 12 network which is a plus since a lot of the bars carrying direct tv don't( asu is in the pac 12 network). Food is ok and the nightly specials are a plus. It gets kinda loud so it's not the best date night if you're looking to converse."}
{"text":"Zipps is my favorite of the local sports bars in Arizona.  I can walk here so that is nice.  The prices are perfect.  They have daily deals and multiple happy hours.  Burgers are fantastic, and the wings are great!  I will say hot is VERY hot!! So if you like it hot but not crazy fire get medium :)"}
{"text":"First off I will start off with that I love the wing.

However that will not make up for how horrible the service is and how long it takes to get your food.  We have came in on two separate occasions and waited at least an hour each time for a simple wing order, the restaurant was barely half full, I have no idea what took so long!  The staff is not attentive and enjoys chatting it with each other more than their customers.

After two bad experiences we decided to do carry out because we really do enjoy the wings.  We placed our order and were told we could pick up our food in 20 min.  Long story short we waited 30 min after showing up on time to receive our wings.

I am not sure why things are so bad at this location, I have had much better service at the ZIpp in Old Town and in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Place is ok. Came in with the family. Probably never coming back. Service was ok, son didn't like chicken strips and waitress weren't very friendly."}
{"text":"First time visiting.  Greeted warmly by the hostess and seated promptly.  Our server came over and greeted us and took our drink order and answered our menu questions.  We ordered the mozzarella sticks, peel and eat shrimp, and wings (dry) with sauce on the side.  Everything was served hot and the server was attentive.  Plenty of televisions to watch sports.  A pleasant surprise and I will return."}
{"text":"no one greeted us when we entered. waitress interrupted our table conversation, and the timing for them to bring chips and salsa to the table was over 15 minutes. poor service, and gross tasting tea, so we walked out, and will never return. bye zipps."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood joint! Glad to see both the floors and staff have been upgraded! My go-to menu item is always the BLT... It is delish. Other than that, good beer on tap and great nightly specials. Always happy to see Titos on the drink menu. Now if only I didn't run into some locals I would rather not see... Zipps would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great to watch a game and drink beer, but the food is HORRENDOUS! Onion rings tasted like they were breaded with drywall, tenderloin sandwich served on generic hamburger bun and tacos left a big pile of grease in basket. Go here to watch the game and then next door to Nello's Pizza to eat."}
{"text":"So disappointed... A few of my friends and I have just recently started to come in on Tuesday nights just to get some food and hang out. The first time wasn't bad our waitress was polite and quick although the one we had last night had not a care in the world. We put in our order for food most of us getting meals and a few of us with appetizers. We had ordered an appetizer quesadilla with only the cheese and tortilla shell.(no onions, peppers, or seasonings) We waited 30 minutes for any food to get out to us. When it arrived the quesadilla had everything on it. Mistakes happen I get that. We politely ask her to replace it and she does with a smile. We all decided we could start eating since a quesadilla usually doesn't take too long... 30 minutes later, an hour after we ordered, my boyfriends quesadilla finally arrived. We had long since finished and had our check and food in boxes already. Maybe the experience wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for our waitress hanging on a boy at the table next to us and payed a little attention to us... I was disappointed that no one seemed to care how long we had to wait to get an appetizer but I guess thats what all the reviews here say. I should have read up first."}
{"text":"Chris was the manager and was phenomenal tonight!! Such good service. The first ASU game was tonight, great people! Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love Zipps it's such a great atmosphere with great food, drinks and service! I would recommend this place to anyone it's super easy going with cheap prices and great quality food/drinks! The servers are always nice when we come in here and very attentive."}
{"text":"Mr. M and I have been here a few times now and I would say overall we've had good experiences.  The great:  the golden wings and the onion rings.  Totally addictive and I could go back there anytime just for those.  In fact, we were there for the last ASU game and there was no talking.  Just eating until we were fighting over the last onion ring.  I distracted him while pretending to dust crumbs off my cleavage and snagged it.  Yes!

The good:  We've never had an issue with servers.  Always friendly and generally quick with refills, drink orders, and the check.  Mr. Erik was the best, but no complaints about anyone.  I also really enjoyed the pepper jack focaccia, the mushroom swiss burger, and the fish and chips on various occasions.  And they have one of my favorite beers on tap, Alaskan Amber, so I am good.  They also made us a mean dirty Ketel One martini one night.  The beer selection is ok, but what they call craft beers are generally not craft beers. We have so many great local breweries, hit them up for some more choices.  Note to management:  go drink at Papago Brewing and Boulders on Broadway and let their beer selections inspire you.  You can still keep the weak, yellow, fizzy, farty beers on tap for the unadventurous.  

The bad:  the BBQ shrimp app.  Weird chemical-like flavor.  And one night we had a good salad with healthy romaine and fresh vegs, and one night we had the bagged iceberg lettuce salad that tastes like what?......Plastic.  Yuck.  A little inconsistent on a couple of items we tried.  

We need to try the pizza and pay more attention to the HH specials.  They have some great deals every day of the week.  Oh now I'm thinking about those wings and O rings.  Time to go back!"}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood bar! Great service and exceptional wing sauce, ranch, and sides. My go-to order is the veggie burger with a side of sweet potato fries and buffalo or golden medium wing sauce with ranch. You cannot go wrong with the sides and dips. Great for games. Also fantastic for pre-spring training as they have a shuttle that takes you to salt river fields"}
{"text":"I came here last week to watch the Europe finals with friends. It's pretty pack and took a while to get service. But my server was nice once she took the order and brought me everything I asked. I didn't expect much here, tried the Ranger IPA, pretty good. Then my fish and sweet potato chips came... woo. It was really good!!! Now, I have to put this joint on my list."}
{"text":"Zipps= bomb diggity! I come here weekly with my husband he loves the wings b the blue moon beer! They play cool music and have great sports to watch on tv"}
{"text":"Love Zipps! The food is not the best culinary experience but it is just as it should be, great neighborhood sports bar! Top 5 places for chicken wings & Love late night specials!"}
{"text":"I'm giving Zipps five stars not because the food is totally, unbelievably amazing, but because I go here so much and it's so consistent that it deserves five stars. 

As someone who will venture into a restaurant strictly for the wings, I must say that Zipps has the hottest, best, juiciest wings in Phoenix.  They're cooked perfectly, sauced liberally and the Golden Hot are seriously something I dream about at least once a week.  I would gladly pay extra for good wings and good service, but Zipps is totally reasonable, especially if you go for happy hour, when the wings are only five bucks and the \"Zipparitas\" are only three, and they don't skimp on the liquor. 

I think I've been to every Zipps in the valley and the Scottsdale location has always been the best.  I don't give a shit about sports, but I like to sit outside on their big orange tables and watch assholes yell at the TV's.  The service has always been prompt and we've never had them fuck anything up.  Also, we've never ordered anything we didn't like.  It's bar food, but it's bar food that is done well and that alone is worth the trip.  I always bring out of town folks to this place if they want good wings and beer.   

I'm a fan for the wings alone.  Don't order the extra hot unless you want to die."}
{"text":"Nope.  Newp.  Nah.  No way.  Never again for this location.  We have always patronized the one on south Arizona Ave & Ocotillo, but since we moved north of the 202, we thought we'd give this Zipps a try and watch some football last night.  They have plenty of TVs and we had no problem watching our game.  I'll just break it down to what was good and what was bad.

The good:  our server, Mandy, is 5-star.  She was super nice and helpful, and did the best with what the kitchen gave her to work with.  We also enjoyed the cold pitcher of Alaskan Amber ($12.50) , the pepper jack focaccia ($8.95), and the fish taco ($7.25), which is more like a fish burrito, but those 2 food items were good.

The bad:  We ordered mild golden wings and are pretty sure we got medium regular wings.  We powered through them because we had a pitcher of beer at hand, but they were not correct.  We both used to work in kitchens and try to never send food back.  The onion rings that I used to rave about were awful.  Old, greasy, and floppy.  Just not good at all.  My husband's fish taco came with chips and salsa which were just generic, nothing special, until he got through the 5 or 6 whole chips on top, and underneath those were the chip crumbs from the bottom of the bag.  The person who poured those chips just flat out doesn't care.  Just that simple.  You can't dip crumbs into salsa.  (No shit, Sherlock, right?) 

To wind it down and get through the 4th quarter we each ordered a Dewars and water.   Those were both water with a hint, a splash, a sprinkling, a wisp, a shadow, a tuft, a shred, a snippet, a twist...

a modicum, a ghost, a bit, a dab, a dribble, a touch, a mite, a smidgen, a nip, a teeny tiny amount...

a dash, a dinky, dwarfish, puny, shrimpish, undersized, runtish, infinitesimal, wee, sparse, deficient, inadequate amount of Dewars.  $6.75 each.  Total rip off.  

Like I said, nope.  Never again."}
{"text":"Seriously it's loud as hell in this place and the food sucks.  Tap selection sucks. Happy hr menu sucks. However the patio is actually pretty nice. Servers have always been good."}
{"text":"Our golf foursome stopped here to have a drink and warm up after getting rained out from our round of golf nearby. 

With Sunday football in full swing, I can sure understand how our server might be frazzled, but too many little things added up to a less-than-ideal experience for our group. 

- We waited way too long to even place a drink order. 
- I couldn't get a cold glass for my bottle of beer (asked twice), and even had to wait on the bartender when I went up to get one myself.
- One order of chili was delivered to table stone cold. Was sent back to be nuked. Server was apologetic. :-)
- My chicken burger had a couple small chunks of grissle and fries weren't that great. 

Overall, there wasn't anything so bad that I'd write this place off forever, but it seems that adding staff on busy days would allow for a higher level of service.

I was facing the kitchen and I could see our server racing around working very hard while other servers were chatting nearby.  In my book, if you have time to chat, you can jump in and help out!

Keep in mind that even though I might not be at your table, I am at your restaurant and may not return, especially with so many other great restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour deals on wings and steal of deal on large Bud Lights - I know it's Bud...but most times it's just the companion you need to go with wings. Hubby likes Buffalo Hot and I love the Medium Goldens. This is the place I crave when I want wings. Great bar and we have always had good service at this location!"}
{"text":"Chicken skewers were good. Even mild sauce was pretty hot.  I may not be back in Scottsdale but if I am, I would go back here"}
{"text":"I was showing my friend around Mill Ave and we were looking for a place to eat for dinner. With Zipp's being a sports bar I thought it would be somewhat similar to Buffalo Wild Wings in terms of the food and drinks. While the atmosphere was fine and it was nice to sit at the patio outside, the food had to be some of the worst that we had.

Both the fries and onion rings were extremely overcooked to the point where we could not even finish it. As for the chicken sandwich it was borderline inedible and it was a struggle to finish. My friend ordered a burger and ushered pretty much the same thoughts to me about his meal, He did finish his burger though but certainly not without a struggle.

The drinks were fine but it would not be worth coming back here due to the terrible food. I'm sure going to Buffalo Wild Wings would have actually been a better choice for the evening."}
{"text":"Service was TERRIBLE. Salad was basically soup. We've been to several Zipps across the Valley and this was by far the worst. Christy was our server and she had amnesia or something --- she took our drink order, brought our drinks, took our food order, a manager brought our food, and we never saw her again. After noticing our pissed off faces, she came over and said, \"hi guys are you looking for your server?\" We said \"aren't you our server?\" And she responds with \"oh nooo I'm sorry I'm not your server\". Didn't you take our drink and food orders?? Idiot. Zero tip. Never going back."}
{"text":"This is like the Cheers of Gilbert in this neighborhood. Great team that works here too. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is for the lack of lunchtime specials!!!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour drinks!! Good price great staff! Love watching the games here and playin pool!"}
{"text":"We came here on our way to the Dbacks game on a Friday night. There were no open seats at the bar so we grabbed a table.

The server greeted us timely and took our order. I enjoyed the grilled chicken sandwich which was very good.

My wife ordered the chicken skewers and she said they were not the best. We frequent the Zipps on Via de Ventura and she said the skewers taste better at that location than this one."}
{"text":"Always a great time at Zipps! The bartenders are always on their A-game and there is no waiting for service."}
{"text":"Very relaxed atmosphere and employees are super nice. We typically go here late at night just in time to get in an order of chicken skewers(which are super yummy) and then have  few drinks. They have 2 pool tables and a shuffle board which always makes for a fun night."}
{"text":"The fish & chips are the worst I've ever had. More batter than fish and they were square patties.  Even McDonalds fish sticks are better (and I hate them too). The onion rings were bad. The server never wrote down our orders and then proceeded to get them wrong. No tomato on the kid's hamburger, as requested, and added jalapeño to the salad when requested to hold it.  She served a salad without silverware and the fish and chips without malt vinegar. All the orders (4) arrived at different times. The tables are also too small for four people. Only use a booth if you have more than three people. This is my third time here and may be my last."}
{"text":"I'm usually lenient when it comes to food reviews, however, it's difficult for me to reward the food here. Mozzarella sticks should be called, \"egg roll cheese sticks\". The outer layer is rolled in pasta, taste as bad as it sounds. The nachos were filled with canned salsa and were cold. I don't expect much from a sports bar, but if they can provide quality food, this place can better. 

Waitress was attentive and she checked up on us regularly. Kudos to the staff."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0 I would. Last night about 10 of my fellow teacher friends and I went to Happy Hour at Zipps on 16th St and Bethany to relax after a long week. Unfortunately it turned into a great night gone bad. We were there over 5 hours enjoying ourselves....the food and drinks were great. Then we went to pay our bills. This is where everything went down hill quickly. They don't keep track of who gets what. One of our friends had ordered 2 Zipparitas at the bar and 1 at our table. He paid for the 2 at the bar beforehand. At the end of the night they tried charging him for 2 at the table. He only ordered 1 at the table. This was a $4 Zipparita mind you. Instead of just saying \"I'm sorry I got it wrong\" and taking it off they proceeded to argue and THEN called the cops on us for a $4 drink. We could've easily paid the $4 and left but it was the principle of being charged for a drink we didn't order. One of our other teachers ended up giving them a $5 bill to cover the charge but they still wouldn't bring us the bill until the cops showed up. Apparently the cops get called to this location all the time over stupid issues like this. It's one thing if a fight broke out or if we all didn't pay our bills but it was over a $4 drink. I would much rather have our police going after the more serious crimes than over a $4 drink. But that's ZIPPS for ya. You know we happy hour quite regularly and go back frequently to the places we like. Unfortunately for Zipps they lost out on a lot of future business because of a $4 drink and poor customer service."}
{"text":"Can they possibly mute the extremely loud commercials? Truly painful! We had to yell our conversations.   Otherwise it's your typical sports bar with few redeeming qualities"}
{"text":"Love the Green Chille Burger. Can't say about the other food because I haven't tried anything else. Last time I went the fries were undercooked, but you can ask them to cook them well done. 
They have great fries but for some reason they decided not to cook them as much. 
Great atmosphere, with several easy to see T.V.s"}
{"text":"My husband and I have come here a few times. The bartenders are really attentive. We went there on Sunday 5/12 and witnessed a customer filing her nails at a bar table. The customer was sitting at the bar table closest to the kitchen. Waiters and waitresses were walking past her carrying food! I saw them take notice that she was filing her nails as they walked past with the food, not saying anything to her. I prayed that my food didn't come out of the kitchen while the customer was setting her finger nail dust into the air! When my food did come out, the customer had already finished filing her nails but I was so grossed out, I couldn't eat my food. Why in the world would this be allowed in an eating establishment?!!  The wait staff needs care  more about what happens in their establishment! Gross!!!"}
{"text":"Another sports bar. Was looking forward to another local good place to enjoy, but I was wrong. This place is SO freakin loud, not all the tv's had subtitles, servers seemed clueless, took forever to get basic stuff, poor quality food. The place was very nice, boothes, tables, tvs and good location off Warner & 48th. A PLUS is their \"Happy Hour\", so if you don't mind the loudness, then enjoy that."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for dinner and while the ambiance is quite enjoyable and the beer is delicious, the quality of the food was really poor."}
{"text":"This place has really good happy hour prices and really good service. The food is below average. Greasy sticky gross. But it's expected due to the low prices and atmosphere. Other than that, great place to have a beer!"}
{"text":"I'll go back if my friends want to have a drink but if it's to eat, no thank you.  We shared nachos and chicken skewers.  My bad that I didn't read the description of the chicken skewers--I thought it would be like satay but it was previously frozen breaded chicken fingers on a stick.  The chicken part was flavorless.  Nachos were the worst I ever had since they were all completely stuck together.  It made it hard to take some out in order to spread the toppings around--the flavor wasn't inedible but it wasn't good either."}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood sport's bar! When I first moved to Tempe a year ago I can remember eating one of my first meals here on patio. The patio is massive with so much seating and TVs for watching your favorite sport game or bystanders passing through Mill Ave. I must admit life has kept me busy lately so I have not been to Zipps for about 2 months but it appears in my absence there has been change to menu. I love it! The menu is easy to read with additions. Zipps known for their Golden wings(delicious) and Zipparitas(limit of 3) but these two together are perfect! I highly recommend. 

I had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with blue cheese crumbles with side of sweet potato chips /fries. I literally ate it all! Very fresh and delicious. I will add these to my favorites among other things from Zipps. I also recommend if you can grab table on patio please do!"}
{"text":"The only reason I keep going back is because the wings are really good. 
and you can't beat a $4 32oz domestic for happy hour. 
other then that most of the waitresses are terrible. they mess around constantly,
no true work ethic."}
{"text":"First time here and service was excellent.  I ordered the Turkey burger and my daughter ordered the wings. Great quality,  everything was freshly made. Fresh cut fries. Everything was delicious. I definitely will be back.  Matt was our server. He was very attentive. .thanks."}
{"text":"I go to zipps a couple times a month. Best wings!!! And zipparitas!! I love going when they have happy hour"}
{"text":"1st time here, it was pretty busy for a Thursday Night. Gold Wings were delicious and just how I asked for them extra crispy. Pizza was good also..will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Worst service we've ever received. Actually we didn't even get served. We sat for 25 minutes and not one person approached our table. We stopped the manager 15 minutes in and he brought us waters for our children and said he would speak to someone, no one came by. We finally just left our beers (we ordered from the bar) half full. I informed the manager and hostess about this and wasn't even offered an apology.  We have been coming here for years. The service has never been great but tonight sealed the deal we will NOT  back and we will tell all our friends and family of our experience."}
{"text":"This is a fun place with very large beers and a yummy (strong) zipparita-in which you can add a flavor to!
 
It does get pretty packed on game nights though, I had a hard time trying to find parking in their large lot when meeting up with a group on a Friday night..head to this sports bar with lots of energy!"}
{"text":"What I want from this review is for the ways of jipping the customer off to stop. Don't tell me that that's the way an ultra light beer comes; an inch head. We're not talking about an IPA or anything. Please make some changes. And learn about \"heads\".

Well, Zipps is one of my favorite places to go and I frequent this place A LOT! It's very sad to see that the manager is stiffing the guests with the pours on beer, makes me wonder what else they stiff on. 
Ordered a Michalobe Ultra and it came to me with at least an inch of beer missing from the top. And it came the second and third again like that. I started watching the drinks being served by the manager and they all had the same shitty pour. I sent the first one back and the said there is nothing they can do because the manager yells at them for that. Not proper. 
Thx"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I come here pretty regularly. Good food & good service. In particular, one server (can't remember his name- tall guy, some facial hair, Tyler maybe?) is ALWAYS awesome!! Always says hi even if we're not his table and his service is great!"}
{"text":"First time in zips. I sat at the bar and ordered a beer around 11:45. As well as the mild hot wings. which were pretty good! At 12:25 the manager informed me that my beer was going to be taken because they were closing down. They close at 1230. I have never been to a bar that tells me they will be taking my beer away. 

On the other hand,  the waitress was great! I'd probably go to a different location next time!"}

{"text":"Good beer, good food, good price. Outdoor seating, big selection of beer on tap, screens for all the games. Good times."}
{"text":"all i ever hear about this place is that the wings are awesome and that they have even awesomer beer specials.

Sorry folks, but I couldn't care less about wings and beer, regardless of how 'awesome' i keep hearing that they are.

The salad I ordered was pretty good. Surpringly good, especially because I am at a sports bar. The balsamic vinagrette was great and the salad was filled with giant chunks of goat cheese and nuts instead of the typical bed of lettuce/spinach with a few tiny toppings.

Granted, I would like this place more if the people in it didn't look so effing fake. Oh, i forgot, its in Scottsdale... nothing you can do about that.

I will say that if you are a girl, make sure you pay attention to which door is the girls bathroom: each door is packed with pictures of men and women in mullets... so figuring out which door has pictures of WOMEN in mullets is kinda tough. You can imagine these girl pictures aren't particularly.. ugh... girly. :)

The picnic style tables and multiple TVs tell me to go with a big group of people. Maybe that way I will pay less attention to the bimbos around me."}
{"text":"The food is ok. What makes this place tough to handle is slow service and it's always super loud. I don't know if it's how the interior is designed or that they play the music too loud. Not sure."}
{"text":"I have a 6 year old daughter who is severely allergic to dairy, beef, & pork. She also has to avoid gluten, all nuts, & seafood/shellfish. We are a family of 3 that eats out all the time! We always pack her food wherever we go & have never had an eyebrow raised until today. We were debating today whether to go to Teakwoods or Zipps in Gilbert. Haven't been to Zipps in a long time so we started there. I was getting my daughter's food out when the waitress informed me that no outside food is allowed. I explained she has severe food allergies & we have to bring her food everywhere we go. She went to get the manager. He came back & told us it's a health code violation that if she got sick it would come back to them. That doesn't even make sense because she's not going to get sick on her safe food from home. So we left & went to Teakwoods where we had no issues. Shame on you, Zipps, for treating an innocent child with food allergies that way! She has life hard enough let alone to be told her safe food is not welcome in your restaurant! Avoid this place as there is no respect for people with food allergies!"}
{"text":"I love Zipps and have been going there for years! Their wings have been amazing but recently they have changed them. You no longer get 12 wings you get 10 bigger wings. They are not as good as they used to be. I hope they change them back. 

Other then that, Zipps is a great sports bar with great food!"}
{"text":"Dog Food is better! We live close, have been long term customers, endured bad food for OK atmosphere because it was close.

Told my dogs THATS OK, YOUR FOOD AT HOME IS BETTER!!!"}
{"text":"I generally like zipps, but I had this one terrible experience with a waitress at this location, which pretty much defines my experience. I hope she reads this.

I was here after work getting drinks with three friends. (four of us total). I was going to cover the bill for myself and one of my friends, and the two other friends were going to pay their own. 

When it was time to go, the waitress came to bring our check. I gave her three cards and said, \"I'm paying his and my bill. Can you put 50% on this card, 25% on this card, and 25% on this card?\"

She gives me a puzzled look, looks at the cards for a moment, nods like she has it figured out and says, \"okay\". Then runs off somewhere. 

After a couple minutes she comes back to me totally steaming. I can't remember her exact words but they were something like \"You can't give me such a complicated order. You need to write down the total for each of you, I can't do this.\" In her shaky, trying-to-keep-it-under-control voice.  

\"Sure, no problem,\" I say. I was annoyed that she didn't just say so up front, but I really wasn't angry at this point. 

I did get angry, however, when she came over a second time to give me another lecture about how you're supposed to split the bill. This time, more angry, she says \"It's not funny to try and confuse us, we're not rocket scientists like you guys (we were dressed in button up shirts and ties), we sling burgers and fries, its not part of our job to do these kinds of math problems. Next time you ask someone to split a check, you need to write down the amounts, because no waitress is going to do this for you.\" 

My response again, \"alright, I understand. It's no big deal, I wrote the amounts for you.\" She leaves. 

COMES BACK A 3RD TIME. \"Listen, I'm sorry if I got angry, but you really need to know this is not okay. You can't give a waitress this kind of complicated problem. We sling burgers and fries all day, we're not good at math (she thought the burger and fry thing was clever enough to repeat.)\"

I'm not one for conflict, but I finally had to interrupt her with something like  \"ALRIGHT. I GET IT. YOU DON'T LIKE MATH. PLEASE STOP TELLING ME ABOUT THIS AND MOVE ON\"

TL:DR; Dumb waitress can't do math and got really angry at me when I asked her to split the check in a way I thought was clear and simple. 

My friends who are smarter than me suggested I left an equation on the tip line.. I really wish I would have."}
{"text":"Monacco Focaccia was delicious... love the jalapeño dipping sauce!  Our waitress, Rainy, was awesome!  Totally on top of drink refills and super attentive to our family!  One of our new favorite places to watch the game!!"}
{"text":"I grew up literally walking distance from this location and have been coming to Zipps Sports Grill since I was in high school so we're talking about 7-8 years now! We use to get a brunch of friends together and go after the Horizon High Scool football games or meet up on weekends, now I have my own family and has a beautiful daughter who loves coming here!! Service has always been a hit or miss over the years, but the food has always been spot on anytime I've visited here! I've gotten to experiment with their menu over the years and the golden mild wings and focaccias are my fave!! Hubby usually gets the chicken skewers and I usually opt for either the chicken or Monaco focaccia with a side salad, ranch and no onion. The chicken Caesar and tenderloin focaccias without the grilled onion are super tasty as well. The sandwiches are super good too!! The tenderloin, the fish sandwich, the chicken breast sandwich, and the fish tacos are delicious!! Make sure you save room for dessert because their cookie skillet is the bomb!"}
{"text":"\"These fries are why I fear going to a nursing home. They just look... neglected.. And old.\"  This direct quote from a friend as we TRIED to put on our best good-sport faces..  But yuck!  Too greasy to eat.  We salted them like we were transporting meat on the open frontier in the pre-refrigerated transport days.  Still unpalatable.  We tried these chicken fingers after refusing to eat the nachos we'd ordered.  HOW do you make bad nachos?   I mean. NACHOS! The meat tasted like fowl boiled in a caldron sometime during the Pre Spice-Wars Middle Ages. We also left the over iced chambord margarita on the table unconsumed and made our way across the parking lot to Z-Tejas to get the real ones.  I've learned my lesson about straying from the Tempe Zip's location.   Our server did her best, but she was playing piano in mittens.  Not a lot she could do with what she was given to work with. I am all for small business, but I couldn't lie to ya. They need Bar Rescue... Save your hard earned greenbacks."}
{"text":"First time at Zipps. I arrived at 1:15 on a Thursday afternoon and it was surprisingly 1/4 full. It was seat-yourself and my server greeted me two mins later. 

I ordered an iced tea and a Buffalo Chicken sandwich, which came with either fries, onion rings, chips or salad. I chose fries. It arrived in six mins, piping hot. 

Chicken was plump, moist with plenty of Buffalo sauce, so good job there. The bun was very boring and reminded me of store bought. Sadly, the Bleu cheese runny like salad dressing. The fries had no seasoning and were pretty much forgettable. I ate 1/4 of them. 

Service was efficient but seemed very rushed even tho half the patrons were gone by the time I finished. 

The vibe was 70s soft rock, which I thought could be moved forward in time. There were plenty of televisions throughout the restaurant. They also had Shuffleboard and pool tables. 

Fix the food and it might be a winner."}
{"text":"Not Bad!
Great if you are just looking for wings and some beers.
Our waitress was great but the bartender was just Eh, but good thing I'm not just basing my review off of him :)
It has a regular sports grill vibe and I loved the music. We will definitely return if we are looking for cheap drinks before we head home."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because their staff is very friendly. The food on the other had was absolutely vile. I didn't even bother sending anything back since everything my friends and I had were horrendous. I mean it's bar food! How hard can it be to make decent beef tacos and chicken tenders? The beef looked like straight dog food and the chicken tenders were something that McDonald's could probably exceed. They were deep friend and super greasy and still cold in the middle. The fries were cold as well. The atmosphere was cool and they had plenty of beer on draft which was nice. Overall I would never recommend this place to anyone for food. If you are just grabbing a beer then it would be that bad of a choice."}
{"text":"Your average sports bar. The place boasts cheap prices for decent bar food, a shit ton of TVs and they have rad specials EVERY day which will give you a reason to come back, if not to watch sports and kick back a few beers. The wings here were also pretty good. The golden sauce in a medium is not spicy at all and you get a hefty portion. I'll be back for some reasonably priced social lubricants soon."}
{"text":"Atmosphere of intimidation, worst bar experience in my life.. will NEVER go back to this pathetic excuse of a bar/restaurant and I've been going to Zipps for years.. Pool table bullies intimidated my date, we didn't even finish our games it was so bad. The manager took no action other than talking to them and allowed them to continue to sit next to us and stare us down until finally my date wanted to leave it got so bad and we still had games that weren't paid for..I tried to talk her into going outside so we could at least finish our food... eventually she called the night to an end as the outside area is engulfed in a ploom of cigarette smoke so we left 5 minutes after going outside because we couldn't go back inside without her feeling intimidated. I had a great impression of Zipps before this experience but they will NEVER get another dime out of me after the way management handled this situation. You NEVER allow your patrons to be bullied, what a complete joke this place is."}
{"text":"So, I am giving this Zipps 5 stars, because have become regulars here and even though we now live 20 minutes away, we still try to make it over here as often as possible.  Joey, the manager, is awesome and always says \"Hi\".  We know several servers and the bartenders.  Everyone has been super nice and friendly.  The food is always amazing, especially the golden-menium wings, cookie skillet and of course the monaco foccacia.  They have a pool table, 2 dartboards, and 2 golden tee games (my husband is a fan).  During NFL season, they open an hour earlier and serve breakfast.  My husband and I had our first date here and this is also where we had our rehearsal dinner.  It is amazing."}
{"text":"Went here for 1st time,  but it was my husband's 2nd time.  We got sandwiches with fries and onion rings. My club sandwich was not 3 layers of bread like a normal club, but it was still ok. Just not what I expected.   We thought the onion rings were terrible. It was loud during the Cardinal game, but not very crowded on a Sunday evening.  Pretty sure we would not go back."}
{"text":"They have plenty of TVs which is nice.  The volume was a little too high and the tables are just a smidge too close together.  Its the little things right?  Also adding to the weird atmosphere is the children sporadically placed in an otherwise sporty bar.

The food is about average to poor.  The wings are decent but could use a little more zip in the sauce.  Definitely not original or exceptional.  The burgers are odd because the meat is actually pretty good but its put in this cheap mcdonald's like bun and all you get is a couple slices of red onion.  First of all, why would you want 2 slices of red onion and what about the usual lettuce and tomato?  Pickle anyone?  The fries are like In and outs of Phoenix area - dry, dark, and shrivelled.  The onion rings are like plump versions of French's onions, the things you put on top of green bean casseroles.  

It seems like a fun place, and I'd love to find something that's great there, but the food is definitely not a draw for me at this point.  At any location."}
{"text":"We went here the first weekend of football season. We made sure to show up right before the 10am games, and were one of the first people there. We went to the hostess to be seated, and she saw that we were wearing Cardinals jerseys. We told her there were two of us, so she proceeded to take us to the back room with a view of one tv- one tv, in a sports bar- saying, \"Here you go, the Cardinals game is on this tv!\" We came to a sports bar to watch all the football games? If we just wanted to watch the cardinals game we would've stayed at home. So anyway, we asked to be seated in the front where we could see all the games. She says, \"I need to ask the hostess.\" They then have this whisper session right in front of us and I hear one of them say, \"So should I tell them they can't sit there?\" Keep in mind, the restaurant was EMPTY at this time. We showed up early to get a good seat. She then tells us unfortunately we can't sit at the table we want because they don't want to give \"two tables in a row to the same server\". They obviously didn't care about customer satisfaction, so we will not be returning. And no less than 20 minutes later they sat someone else where we wanted to sit who showed up after us. I do not understand we were denied that table and the next people in could sit there."}
{"text":"Great service.  Horrific food.  Ordered fish tacos and was served a deep fried tasteless mess in a burrito (fish tacos).  Also ordered focaccia which was, yes, also in a tortilla (again, focaccia).  The chicken sandwich contained some type of cheese which tasted like Velveeta; something you'd eat very late at night in a dingy dorm room.  I can honestly say that in 40 years of eating in the valley I have never had worse food than this.

I'm getting sick just typing this."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of sports bars, but we decided to try Zipps since it's close by. We were pleasantly surprised. First off, the prices are very reasonable. The service was very friendly, and the food was delicious. I really enjoyed my turkey burger. They accidentally brought our food out before our wings, but the manager came and apologized and offered us a free dessert. We didn't even have to complain. And the cookie skillet was delicious, though I personally would like it slightly less cooked. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Awesome wings and their Happy Hour prices and selections are great. 
Highly recommend the Zipp's at 211 Warner Rd., Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? This place is horrible. Ive had three horrible experiences in a row. I was there until close today. I paid for a beer at last call. At 2:05 they took my beer from me. I was playing pool and didn't know they take your drinks from everyone. My beer was 3/4 full. I work at native grill and wings and we always let people finish their drinks. I guess zipps doesn't think the customer is always right or wants them to come back. Zipps treats people really poorly. They wouldn't comp me or give me any incentive for coming back. You literally took money from me. You definitely lost a customer."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant of Zipps when we pulled in - didn't look from the outside like it would offer an awesome time.  Walking in around 7 on a Friday night revealed a place that was almost full.  We chose to sit on the chilly patio, which did have a couple of heaters.  The heaters were a little high up and less effective, but it was also one of the coldest nights this year. 

Service was fast and friendly, we never ran out of beer.  I got the BLT on Sourdough, and so did my friend, her husband got the Black and Blue Burger.  The fries were good, but not as crispy as I like.  The flavor was great and I ended up eating all of them.  The BLT was awesome! Tons of crispy bacon, and they cut it so that you were able to eat the sandwich without bacon attacking you.  The sourdough bread was thick cut and lightly toasted.

The burger was a little less than we expected - 2 nice size patties, but the blue cheese could have been done a little better, and it was very messy.  The onion rings were nice sized and with great, fluffy breading on them.

The on tap beer list was a little heavy on the cheap domestics for my taste, but they did have an Alaskan Amber that went great with the food.

We were able to sit and talk for several hours, and the server made sure that we always had what we needed."}
{"text":"Ok so we go in to check it out. Service was good nothin special but it's busy and to be kinda expected. We wait 40 min for our food finally someone brings it.. The food is completely cold. But we haven't ate all day so we eat what's editable. And let them know it's cold. A manager comes over to ask us how things are. We explain we haven't ate all day and that if  the food had been warm it would have been good. However we are in a hurry and need to
Go and don't want to wait for more to come
Out the manager says sorry I'll take care of it! Our server returns with the whole price check and the manager after we explain we live 3 hours away. Gives us 15$ in zip cash! (R u kidding) anyways needless to say didn't seem like they care to much about their guest. Like I said food could have been good warm. However service and everything else makes a 1 star for me!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday afternoon and we had a great experience! Bailley was our server and she was excellent!  Cookie skillet is always a must! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying \"I am a huge fan of Zipps\".  However, I will say that each location is different.  I went here the other night with a big group, about 20-25 people.  The server was not what I would call attentive or personable.  It took forever for us to first get asked what we wanted to drink and then for her to bring them.  Then when more people showed up, it took at least 10 minutes for her to greet them.  I understand that we were a big group, but if you need help, ask for it.  So, I would not say that this place (this location) is good for large groups."}
{"text":"Love this place, you can see the teamwork  , everyone helping each other.  Manager is awesome.  And the food and service is great."}
{"text":"Ok....so, it's been a while, and since I live so close and have three kids I was limited on options. So we decided to try this location again. Man, am I glad I did! Those wings were on point! Cooked to perfection and made my nose run! I had to call the manager just to tell him that if they keep cookin like this, I'll keep comin back. Honestly would've been 5 starts but they forgot the jalapeños on my wife's burger. Can't all be perfect, I'll be back though!"}
{"text":"I lived in AZ for a bit a few years ago and loved this place!  Nothing on the menu is bad.  I especially like their Monaco focaccia, sweet jalapeno dressing, and cookie skillets, but seriously everything was great.  I would be the happiest person in the world if I could get the recipe for the sweet jalapeno sauce!  They also have cheap happy hour and late night specials.  The chips and salsa are awesome!  I would highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Solid go to for wings, beer and sports.  A sports bar worth writing a review for is one I would recommend to anyone who wants good food and a good atmosphere for a game.  Zipps specialties are the wings and the focaccia sandwiches.  I always get either of these when I go.  I've been going here for about 6 years now.  As more and more of them keep popping up, it's starting to feel like a chain restaurant.  The product is good and consistent through all locations so give it a try."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, and great specials!! The neighborhood joint with familiar faces."}
{"text":"Well I have had plenty of service issues with this Zipps in the past, this time was the last.  We had 8 people going to lunch and zipps has a company policy against pushing tables together to accommodate 8 people. So-we walked across the parking lot to Z-Tejas instead. They seated us and we will drop $500 here instead 
If only Zipps management would come out of their ivory tower and listen to its customers.  This was my first visit back since boycotting for the past 6 months due to service- my letter to HQ also went unanswered 
Oh well-"}
{"text":"My experiences here have ranged way too much to be able to give this place anything more than two stars.  The service and food is so inconsistent.

+yeah, the happy hour specials are priced well...
- ...well enough to almost overlook how bad the food is (referring to onion rings, nachos, and burgers)
+the staff is friendly enough...
- ...friendly enough to almost ignore the rude bartender who wouldn't serve us at 1am (mind you the two of us were sober and coming back from going out and wanted a drink before the two block drive home) claiming they were closing down even though she took two other customer's orders since we had popped in

If you live within walking distance of this place (like the apartments or houses around it) it's okay...barely, but I would never go out of my way to drive here and thankfully had a five minute walk over from our apt."}
{"text":"Great environment loud, fun, lots of TV's. Great bar area. The food is only so so. Other then the wings nothing I have had to eat there has impressed me. The focachia sandwiches that they seem to push are unimpressive. If your primarily interested in hanging out and having a good time this is the place for you, if you are going for the food go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We love this place - it's our \"go-to\" sports bar. Cozy atmosphere, tons of televisions to watch the game, and for a sports bar - the food is actually REALLY good! Try any one of their focaccias - their my favorite. 

Really good happy hour specials, too! Love that we can get two huge beers and dinner for under $20.

My only wish: That they had 2 shuffle board tables. We are here all of the time and it is always taken!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for wings.  Wish they had a Zipps on the West Side of town.  If you like spicy wings, try their \"Golden Hot\".  Love em!

Careful though, they are hotter than the usual Hot elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Wings wings and more wings. Oh and a Zipparitas. Need I say more?!!!

Today I will be having my braces removed. This would be my first day to visit Zipps without braces. I am planning on enjoying every moment of the visit.

Zipps is a great location to finish the big game at. The outside patio has a"}
{"text":"First and last time I will come here. On a good note, the medium wings are pretty good. They were a bit over cooked but the flavor was decent. My wife ordered Nachos and they were disgusting, and The French fries tastes like cardboard.  I recommend eating before you come. We came for the early games and it was almost impossible to get food, and service is pretty slow."}
{"text":"I wish I could leave a huge ZERO for this place. First time I've been to the location, it will also be the last. Our food and drinks were fine even though we had asked for a few things more than once. It took a little over an hour to get our food. Which wasn't even the worst part. 

The worst part was when we repeatedly told management, and we weren't the only table who complained, about the screaming kids. These kids were screaming at the top of their lungs for NO REASON. We then move outside because we hadn't finished out drinks and these kids come outside and reeked havoc out on the patio, still no manager or any improvement. The lady with the screaming kids said that it was fine, that kids would be kids and she also told us to chill out. WORSTTT restaurant experience I've ever had. These kids screamed for a good two hours. I finally decided to leave, ZIPPS lost all of my business. I wasn't expecting a 5-start experience but I was wasn't expecting to leave with a migraine."}
{"text":"Went last weekend with 10 friends that came from overseas and they were not allow to drink alcohol because they only have a passport and not American ID!"}
{"text":"Great sports bar option if you live in the CenPho area.  There are plenty of other places close by to watch a game (16th Street Bar and Grill, etc), but the new Zipps has a plethora or TVs, better food / drink options, patio seating (hooray for you smokers) and is much cleaner.  I myself, am not a huge sports bar fan- I'd much prefer the Vig, Garage or something along those lines. However, on game day, especially the Cards, Devils, Wildcats or Suns are playing... it's the place to be.

If you aren't a huge beer fan, try out the Chambord Zipperita. Yum! And for the ladies, they have an improved wine list, although it's nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Katherine was a terrible server! I understand that sports bars are a laid back environment, but to have a table need to flag you down multiple times just to place orders is inexcusable. She wasn't friendly in any way and to be perfectly honest I contemplated asking to be transferred to a different server. Not worth wasting 2 hours to get lunch."}
{"text":"Love this location it's close to my home and every time I come there's almost always room at the bar and all the bartenders are awesome who make good drinks."}
{"text":"my balsamic salad came without dressing. since I had to ask for some, they decided to charge me for extra dressing. always issues like this at the Gilbert location."}
{"text":"This place is just plain bad all around!! How? Read on. The managers here change every couple months and one is worse than the next. Uneducated, unprofessional, poor communicators, slow, lack basic understanding of customer service and building patronage. There's a reason they can't keep or find wait staff, nobody wants to work here or work under subpar management. The food is good when it arrives even remotely warm or correct, which it rarely does. Not worth risking coming here for the rare times it will be correct. Music is always way too loud to carry on a conversation without yelling.

In a nutshell, you WILL have issues with your food, and with the service, and when you try to get help, you'll likely deal with a worthless, rude, first time \"manager\" like Rafael, who's been there 9 months and like all the others won't last another 3. He hasn't got the slightest clue how to treat customers with respect or retain them, has no comprehension of the cost of acquiring new customers versus keeping long time customers, and is just plain unfit to be \"managing\" anything except maybe a table or two of his own.

My family of 5 has somewhat regularly eaten here and has spent a lot of money each time despite this place's ongoing, never ending issues. We have given them chance after chance and excepted numerous empty apologies and tried them again. No more!! Tonight, worthless \"manager\" Rafael sealed the deal and we'll never return. Well done Raphael, your rude, \"screw the customer\" attitude just cost Zipps their most valuable assets, return customers and reputation. I'll share my experience with everyone.

Look at my reviews. Mostly positive, regularly searching for the good. We've tried with this place, given them lots of chances, too many, and they just don't get it. My recommendation, avoid it like the plague.

-----

Sure, I'll respond to you. First off, telling me I'm bashing your managers when I've clearly stated that Zipps managers, their unprofessionalism, discourtesy, incompetence, lack of customer focus and rudeness are a major part of Zipps problem, is a bit redundant and obvious. Yes, they are ONE of Zipps major areas of concern and reason for low ratings. Managers may show some kind of dedication to you, per your comment stroking their performance, but shouldn't they be trained to show dedication, care and concern for customers? Remember us, those who keep Zipps in business. You asked for help making Zipps better. Isn't that what you've gotten from me, and the NUMEROUS other reviewers who have disclosed the many issues Zipps has? Has anyone at Zipps been listening? I've openly and honestly disclosed the numerous issues with your management, if you want to call that bashing, I suppose that's fine. Second, as previously mentioned, my family and friends and I have dealt with wrong food, cold food, missing food, overly loud music where we've asked to have it turned down time after time, visit after visit, and rude, incompetent (under trained, not empowered, inappropriate) managers many times. Yet for years we've kept giving you chances. More than you likely deserved, but we've tried to support you. I think that \"is\" pointing out recent issues and trying in vain to help you improve. Did you read those parts? It seems your redundant questions may be more Zipps management not listening, instead wanting to be heard and trying to be \"right\"? Keep in mind, I have nothing to gain by providing my readers anything but the truth. Nor do the abundance of other reviewers who find issues with Zipps. Last night Rafael decided not to honor a simple, easy, happy hour commitment on 2 small drinks that were already served to us with the clear understanding that they would be honored. That's how it started and could have happily ended. When we asked him in the most friendly and positive way if we could work it out since we were told it would be fine and the drinks were already served to us with that understanding, he rudely, obnoxiously told us no, that he was the manager, this was his restaurant, his boss/GM said no and that was that. When we asked to speak with the GM, Rafael told us no, that he (Rafael) was making the final decision and if we don't like it we can leave. So we did. How's that, does it help you? How about this, my family and friends have \"helped you\" by supporting Zipps through years of bad service and spent thousands of dollars there, now that I've helped you with more information and spent more of my time supporting you with information, how about a personal, in-person apology from Rafael followed by a year of free meals for my family?  That will be your opportunity to make things right. If all is well after that, I'll update my review, provide an updated rating, and everyone wins. My guess is that won't happen, that you'll take my free advice and will give nothing back to those of us that have supported you and have been mistreated in return. Your response will show all readers what Zipps is all about."}

The manager there once clearly stated to us we were going to watch what he preferred..vis a vi his staff of course, the poor.waitress we asked to change the channel. 

Great spot. Light rail bAby"}
{"text":"Awful. Awful. Awful. Took the family out for what I hoped would be a nice dinner. 

Seated ourselves as the sign said. Waiter looked shell shocked when we sat down. Ordered drinks, they came promptly. 

Kids ordered from kid menu. One had chicken on a stick. It was dropping in grease. Cold fries, cardboard onion rings rounded out the meal. 

I ordered a chicken  taco salad.  The meat was beyond fatty, cold, and the bowl was full of the white yucky part of iceberg lettuce. 

Asked for extra tomatoes and they looked at me all sideways. 

Overpriced, awful food. Will not be back nor would i recommend."}
{"text":"Only reason this place isn't getting one star is because I love watching the game on all the tvs. Me and some friends came in and the food took FORVER to get their. She forgot lemon, I ordered a salad and it was probably the most disgusting salad I've ever had. The lettuce was soggy and it tasted so old. The onion rings are usually pretty good. The service is SO bad! They stand around chit chatting instead of tending to customers. Honestly it gets worse every time so we've been going to native. Instead of hiring pretty girls hire people who can take a proper order."}
{"text":"Had some time to kill between the Chandler BBQ & Beer Festival and the Dbacks night game at Salt River Fields when I remembered the Zipp's Bus!  The bus makes multiple trips between Zipp's and Salt River fields for all Spring Training games before and after so you can avoid parking fees and sitting in traffic on the way out of the game. Sure you spend your parking fee and then some on booze and food, but we still had a good time.  The food was decent, we ordered some chicken nachos and later on their chicken \"skewers\", which we basically chicken strips on a stick.  Our server was attentive as our beers stayed cold and some pregame shots were consumed.  If I lived closer by this would be a regular spot for me for sure."}
{"text":"I.LOVE.Zipps!  Seriously, I have been to almost every location in the valley, because no matter what time of day or what I am doing, Zipps is always a good idea!  This location in particular is my favorite.  The staff here is the friendliest, the service is prompt, the food tastes great and the specials!  Between the weekend hangover, happy hour, and daily specials, there is a great chance that there is a special happening at the time I decide to stop by."}
{"text":"Zipps Sports Grill is a real fun sports bar, especially if you're college age. We had plenty of tv screens to view the games. It got a little too loud for me which made it hard to have a conversation! It's obvious this is a popular spot to go to. I ordered a salad with walnuts and the balsamic dressing. The salad was fresh, but the dressing was very sweet. It was almost like eating candy and salad at the same time. My partner ordered wings which were delicious and my brother-in-law had a sandwich with sweet potatoe fries, I know he really enjoyed his meal, it was obvious! The beers were huge and I enjoyed my glass of wine. Zipps is a fun place to go to watch games and have fun with friends."}
{"text":"I came here about a month ago.  I always get a delicious Zipparita and chips, salsa, and guacamole.  We sat at the bar and it was pretty busy.  The service was great.  They always are attentive and take good care of us!"}
{"text":"It's my neighborhood bar.  No frills here, I have to say the first time we came the service was suspect.  However, each time it's gotten better and I may have to re-visit my star rating as I continue to come back.

My favorite is either the Green Chile Burger or the Turkado with half and half fries and sweet potato chips I'm working around on the wings, only need to try extra hot golden and buffalo and then judgement will be final."}
{"text":"Pop Quiz:  
Would you prefer a sports bar, with a lot of beer specials on tap? 
Or...  a nice restaurant, that has a good beer selection?

Well, I'm more in the second group.  Though I do enjoy a nice watering hole.  Zipps however fails the food test.  Well at least last night they did.

Yelp'er Scott D and I came here around 5:30 yesterday, to enjoy a cold beer and some good conversation.  I had ordered the chips, salsa and guacamole HH (photo) appetizer for $4.00.  The salsa was a puree of something red and didn't have much kick or taste.  The Guac had an odd texture, with I believe saute onions in it.  Again, no taste, no cilantro, no Pico and nothing special.

We did like the beer.  Zipps runs 32 ounce specials for $3.75 on various beers. We had the Michelob and it was great.  We also each ordered some of their pizza wedges for $2.00 each.  The pepperoni was just okay, while the sausage had a faint fennel taste to it.

If our food order stopped there, I might have been inclined to give them three stars.  But as we were getting our checks, my daughter called and asked if I would get her some takeout.  She asked for: \"Golden medium wings ($7.50) and a order of 1/2 Fries and 1/2 Onion Rings ($3.25) along with some extra Golden Sauce ($0.50)\".

When I got home, she opened the boxes and we couldn't believe what we were given.  The Onion rings were charred burnt and inedible, while the fries were a cold soggy mush.  The chicken however wasn't bad.

So \"Two Stars\" M'eh. Yes, we've experienced better.  Return factor, Zero."}
{"text":"Great burgers lots of tvs for sports. Wait staff very friendly and attentive. Pizza was ok there are better pizza places nearby. Would go there again"}
{"text":"Typically I love Zipps.  I've been to most of the locations, and the food and atmosphere are always good.  However, I went to this location - on two separate occasions - for football Saturday.  It was obvious both times that they were severely understaffed, but that should never be a problem for a big football Saturday.   One time we waited thirty minutes, ordered drinks about twenty minutes in and never got them.  The second time we stood waiting to be seated for 10+ minutes and no one ever even acknowledged us. I may go back to Zipps, but I certainly won't go to this location to watch a game."}
{"text":"I will try this place one more time before giving up on it.

I would never in a million years eat inside the restaurant.  It is so loud with all the tv's playing many different sports and all the patrons.  

I got 2 dozen traditional hot wings to go.  When I ordered them I was informed that they are VERY HOT and I may want to go with medium.  Since they were for my husband and some friends who enjoy very hot food I got them.

When I picked them up the staff was very apathetic, bordering on rude.  The wings were very very very hot.  Los Dos Molinos doesn't hold a chance against the spice level of these wings.  All three adults and 2 kids eating them at tears, red faces, starting eating bread afterward and put ice packs on their lips!

Next time I will order the medium heat wings to go."}
{"text":"Nice tv's food is mediocre at best. Their famous zipp burger was too well done. Our server was really good and the only positive. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I LOVE zipps so I was excited there is one close to work. However I was very disappointed in this location. 

There was no hostess, so you have to seat yourself and there was only one table available, which was dirty. I waited 10 minutes at a dirty table without being greeted, or having had the table bussed. So I left without anyone even noticing me. All restaurants get busy. But you need a hostess to at least greet, and a busser to clean tables. 

The food is always great, but sometimes good service is more important than the food."}
{"text":"Great place and it's nice that they do a shuttle service to the waste Management Open and EVERY YEAR they are NOT prepared to serve you. Food takes forever and always wrong... so note to self to  use your $10 voucher when they are not busy"}
{"text":"Everyone is complaining that the food sucks...well I didn't order food. My drinks came in a timely fashion. I had no trouble finding a seat and they have TVs everywhere including the patio. Let's Go Cowboys!"}
{"text":"The service is extremely slow!  We sat at our table and must have had 4 waitresses go past without a clue!  The hostess finally came over and we mistook her for our waitress and she said she would send someone right over...10 min later and nothing.  I called the restaurant on the phone line and again I was told someone would be there.  A few minutes later the waitress showed up and checked on the two tables next to us and ignored us....what a waste of time!!!!  I have never been treated this poorly at an eating establishment."}
{"text":"We had to wait for our food for over an hour. The appetizers were served at the same time and not all the food was served at the same time. To make matters worse, the food was awful, greasy, and flavorless. The mozzarella sticks were severed as egg rolls with cheese stuffed in?? I'm not sure if they ran out of ingredients but it was weird. The nachos were clearly microwaved and the fries were limp and cold. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Has the worse customer service visited this location on May 17,2018 on my lunch break the bartender is rude and works with nasty long dirty acrylics and not attentive to the guest . My order was late the food was messy all over the place she didn't apologize and laughed with the  cook when going to retrieve my burrito she fumbled in the kitchen"}
{"text":"Just like the other Zipps.  = Ok bar food. Ok service. Ok prices.

Love the fries.

Not really any good beers on tap or bottles."}
{"text":"I have been going to Zipps for many years, and they have mostly been decent over the years. Tonight was my first visit to their new location near my house in Chandler. I had been craving some hot wings for a couple of weeks, and tonight I finally went out to satisfy that craving. Zipps is one of the few places that still has a decent happy hour deal for wings at $6.25 doz. 

I got a dozen hot, and a dozen extra hot. When they arrived the extra hot wings smelled a little burnt, but I always start with the hot, and move up to the extra hot. The hot wings had lots of sauce on them, but they were not very hot. They were very soggy, and barely cooked. The burnt smell on the extra hot had me concerned, so I tried one after my second wing, and they were nasty. They were not hot at all, but they tasted like burnt peppers, which is exactly what they were. Their extra hot was just some oil that they dumped a bunch of red pepper flakes in and burnt them to the point that they cooked out the oils that make them hot. There was not red sauce at all, just blacked red pepper flakes, and wings were soggy as well. I finally got the servers attention and let them know they were bad. I requested just hot wings as a replacement. 

When the replacements came they had virtual no sauce on them at all, but at least they were a little more done. I wouldn't call them crispy, but at least they were completely cooked. Thankfully the first batch of hot had sauce left in the bottom of the basket. Normally I take home about a about 6 or 8 wings from the two dozen order, but after these wings had very little meat on them so I finished them all. 


I am hoping this was just an off night, so I will give them another chance, but it's sad to see that the new location isn't an improvement from their prior store. The server was a little overworked it seemed. They only had one order taker, and one food delivery girl in the bar area. Two real waitresses would have been a better idea. I hope they find a better cook. when half of the menu is fried food, they need someone who knows how to use a fryer."}
{"text":"Delicious 1000 burger with a veggie garden patty, fries were too greasy and over cooked to eat. Service was fast and bartender was very sweet. Will be coming back to try other burgers with the veggie patty:)"}
{"text":"I'd never think of being negative with Zipps, but I have to admit there is a pattern across all locations. Service and honesty. I can't tell you how many times I've visited Zipps without having some sort of issue. Restaurant isn't busy? Wait 40 minutes for food. It's slammed.... Don't bother waiting for food items that vary in look and quality across locations. They often charge $.50 cents for sides that come with the entree! Premium drafts after 8pm for $6? The waitress will lie and tell you the one or two premium brands you ordered is on special while it's not. I'm done with poor service time, quality, consistency and honesty. Four Peaks, OHSO, KO's are all in the neighborhood. Why settle??"}
{"text":"We have been regulars at Zipps  for years now ( live local  ) and take outs were always spot on. The last two orders were totally messed up - again wings were undercooked and everyone seemed to be in a big hurry to get you out the door . Last nite , Ordered 36 wings and 2 salads to watch Sunday night football. ZIPPS Totally fumbled the order , manager offered to send us a coupon- almost laughable, he missed the point as we just wanted what we ordered - not a big chicken fan medium rare.:)


Don't know if new manager hired  or new line cooks,  but very disappointed in last two to go orders and last nights order was screwed up again !
Would not recommend take out until this gets corrected - at least  if your an eat in customer you could send back to the kitchen."}
{"text":"If I ever am laid up in a hospital bed dying I just want someone to feed me some of their well done French fries dipped in medium golden sauce till I go. THIS SAUCE IS LIKE MAGIC. Wish they sold bottles of it because I would put it on everything."}
{"text":"I love Zipps! It is one of the best bars in Tukee. The servers and bartenders are always wonderful. All of the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"3 stars for food... if I could rate the service I would say a 2. We came here only bc we had a gift certificate. Yes we wanted to watch the hockey playoffs, but the soccer game was on so that's what we heard LOUDLY over the speakers. Ok that's fine but at least have subtitles on the screens!
We had the mozz sticks, a hamburger and prime rib sandwich.. my husband liked his burger.. although the buns for his burger and my sandwich were beyond basic... like Bashas brand basic buns... 
oh and I hope you have no where to go quickly. Slowest service ever. 
Probably not coming back.. not worth the price for the service."}
{"text":"LOVED the \"hot\" wings.  I rarely find one that is truly \"hot\" but today I met my match.  Good thing I didn't go for the \"extra hot\".  This comes from a girl who always carries hot sauce in her purse.  ;-)

Good food.  Love that you can get half fries and half onion rings.  Typical sports bar.  Good drinks although they didn't have any of my faves on tap.  Nope, no Guinness on tap.  Overall a great place to watch \"the game\" and enjoy some good bar food."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for happy hour. I ordered a hamburger and fries. The hamburger is the size of a McDonalds burger. Way over priced. The worst fries on the planet! Greasy and limp. So I asked manager for a new order. I was done with little burger before next fries came. I told him never mind. But he he no charge! Refills are free! Still great and limp. Last time we come here."}
{"text":"Me likes the zipparitahhhh!  :). And the chips and guac were good too!  Great place to relax!"}
{"text":"The food sucks.... The service is SLOW..... The staff is bloody RUDE!!!! Reality check Zipps!!!! Embrace the little amount of business you have won't be long till your doors are closed forever and your rude staff is unemployed and homeless.  Karma."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is so awesome. I would give this place 5 stars if it weren't for the service! Get zipps wings golden style"}
{"text":"My experience at this restaurant was probably one of the worst I've ever had. My friends and I went there for a Suns game and were seated at a booth near the door. As we were sitting there, a girl who was waiting for a table, looked above our table and saw a cockroach crawling right over our table. Now granted, I have a phobia of bugs, and especially roaches, but this seems to me, like a pretty big deal. After the initial scare, I informed our waitress of this and she freaked out for a second, and ran off to tell someone. She didnt return for another 5 minutes, though it was only to bring drinks. I then told the host near the door and he exclaimed that it was horrible and he walked away(apparently to get someone?). After another 10 minutes still nothing happened so I found the guy again and told him nothing has been done yet. By this time, the others at my table had gotten their food. He told me that since it was so high on the ceiling there was no way for him to get to it. Now, I'm no engineer, or trained exterminator, but I had about 2-3 different ideas on how to get to the roach. I didnt realize he was stumped. I felt like I should make a bigger deal about it, but instead I left. I don't feel like anyone should be forced to eat in those conditions, without at least an attempt to rectify it. I mean, I dont have any delusions about spic and span restaurants. I know restaurants are dirty, but to have a roach hanging over our table is unacceptable. And the only reason the management would do nothing is because it would have made a scene. I guarantee you if everyone else in the restaurant had seen it or was experiencing it, SOMETHING would have been done. For us to have to endure it because no else was being affected is basically saying we dont matter enough for them to do anything. 

How was the food you ask? I didnt even see it since I was focusing on the large roach hanging over my table."}
{"text":"Tasty food , an open and inviting atmosphere, but the  absolute most  standout part of our experience was our bartender Sadie! She is a gem! Not only is she adorable and amazing but she is also effortlessly attentive and inviting.  She alone made this lunch one to remember :-)  if you ever come into zips on mill ave in Tempe be sure to request the beautiful and amazing Sadie! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Kayla was great ! cooks were great ! service fast. Had BLT  and wings and Quesadila awesome"}
{"text":"Typical tasty bar food, great daily deals and friendly cute servers. My only complaint which will prevent me from going back is the management, especially the manager Andrew. Very rude, inconsiderate, and condescending. Does not go out of his way to make the customer experience great. Very, very disappointed in their management selection."}
{"text":"I am so happy that I finally made it to Zipps.  The bar staff is very friendly and the beers are big and cold.  They have great happy hour prices and all of the food that I have tried has been great.  I look forward to many return visits."}
{"text":"You know I never thought I'd say this but... I wish I could leave a review without leaving any stars. This is the WORST Zipps in town. The customer service is horrible (especially the older woman that always serves the patio/bar side!) it's great that they have a good menu/good prices but my gosh! If you're going to work customer service please KNOW what it's about. They make it seem like they're doing YOU a favor by even taking your order. 

My friends and I came here for dinner and ordered wings/beer. there was a total of 3 orders of wings, they came back & gave us 2. Then the girl acted like it was OUR fault that she only put an order for 2 instead of 3. Came back & told us the kitchen was closing. We asked to speak to a manager & the manager was nicer than our waitress but still nothing they can do other than giving us their apologies. 

If you love Zipps visit the Indian school location. They have the best customer service & same prices/menu. 


I truly hope they take these reviews into consideration & retrain ALL of their employees."}
{"text":"Why isn't there a ZERO star?? How does it take you 35 minutes to bring my son his onion ring appetizer? It actually came out with our food. So sad bc our waitress seemed nice but the fact that our wait time was more than my allotted lunch time and we were there at 1115am with only three other tables and didn't leave until after 12:30 makes this the WORST joint for customer service. Not to mention the manager is a JERK, made you pay for extra dressing that they forgot.....no cash, put it on your card! Umm it costs your business more than 50 cents to process a 50 cent card transaction.  His answer? Don't like it don't come back. Really?! You have 4 tables during a rush lunch break and you can afford to basically tell your customer to screw off?  I just hope the waitresses go somewhere else bc I'm sure he hurts them in the tip area. If you're thinking about going to Zipps maybe think about keep traveling on a block or two west on University to Chili's (where Boston's used to be). They're just starting out and still 137 times better in every area this this place. Btw, food was ok, same level as Chili's though and again you'll get better customer service from them than Mr Manager of Mill Ave Zipps could even fathom....137 ZERO stars. I have no idea how they are still in business!!"}
{"text":"Happy hour 32 oz beer for $3.75. $1.50 pizza slices, $6 wings & chicken skewers."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch after the driving range. Would definitely recommend the Pepper Jack Foccia, it was amazing! Servers were quick and to the point the food definitely exceeded expectations."}
{"text":"I love the wings and ziparitas! But we got the timing wrong visiting this location ...there's happy hour prices, and after 8pm drink deals. But we came in at 7:30 so we paid full pop. Next time we'll be more organized time wise to take advantage of the deals. We've been to Zipps many times and had wings, burgers and plenty of drinks over the years. I like that you can seat yourself and that they keep the tables clear. Service is usually quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Two couples stop to have drinks and dinner. After walking thru a small group of smokers standing right in front of front door we entered the loudest bar/restaurant ever. Very nice friendly server arrives to take drink order. Explains happy hour program. Well drinks are $ 3.00. I order a Amaretto Sour which she said is ok as a well drink. All bars carry a well Amaretto.  Good I'm not a big drinker and we stopped to drink, $3.00.  Drinks come & so does the full press for food order before I took a sip of my drink or looked at the menu. Wife orders the basket appetizer a small basket of fried junk including onion rings and homemade chips. Delivered along with an order of chicken Skewers, breaded boneless chicken on a skewer.  The Basket food was actually cold enough to believe  it had come out of the fridge not the fryer. I had our server actually hold an ice cold onion ring. She offered a replacement order & we passed.  Ordered a plain burger instead and I ordered 2 pieces of Happy Hour Pizza at $ 1.50 a piece and was told it came with 1 topping.  OK let's wrap it up, Chicken Skewers dry and tasteless like they had baked in an oven for days, the burger was as if it came off a chains $ 1.00 value meal menu, the pizza OK for a sports bar but priced at $2.00 with 1 topping, and the Amaretto Sour on the check came back at $ 4.75 and a poor explanation of why it wasn't a happy hour price.  The other guest ordered a chicken Caesar Salad and had no comment. Never saw a manager who you would think have stopped to apologize for the cold appetizer. Moral of the story there are so many places to spend your hard earned money than Zipps."}
{"text":"Did not like the Chandler location but this one was great! The food was amazing and the drinks were perfect. Because the specialty burgers were part of happy hour, we all got burgers and weren't disappointed! 

The only reason this doesn't get my full five stars was because the service left something to be desired."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour.

Definitely a sports bar atmosphere. Loud and big. Definitely laid back atmosphere. 

When you come to a sports bar, you order bar food and drinks. I got there famous zipparita and my friend got a beer. Nice prices during happy hour for drinks. Wasn't much selection for food durning happy hour. I ordered some cheese pizza slices and my friend ordered the sweet jalapeño burger. The burgar was really good. The fries needed to be fried more but besides that the food was decent. Four Peaks and San Tan Brewery have the best fries.

The waitress wasn't extraordinary but she wasn't bad. So the service was...neutral.

This place is worth maybe 3 and 1/2 to 4 stars. It's good for what it is. There's better."}
{"text":"Freshly opened on Mill Ave and I'm a fan! 

The food is perfect chowing down after a night of drinking and debauchery. The waitress we had was super nice, and the security guard didn't kick me out after drunkenly threatening to chop off his penis.

As with all Zipps in general i believe their Zipperatas should have the option of being frozen or on the rocks."}
{"text":"First time at Zipp's.....  and LAST.  Charged us a dollar for extra Ranch dressing.....  Really????  I prefer Ranch for my onion rings......  Whats next a charge for Ketchup or Mustard?   Weak, Weak Weak!!!!  Do you really need money that badly?  Terrible business practice.  We will NEVER be back to this or any other Zipp's!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Can't use my gift card with 500$ on it. Went somewhere else but really wanted a Monaco!!! Won't be back."}
{"text":"Mmmmm Zipp's is where my son and I have lunch together every Friday. We always order the same thing. Chicken tenders!  They are amazing!!!  I have to say that this last Friday we were both disappointed and still hungry with the small serving size!  I hope they aren't planning on dropping their portion sizes because that will not make me happy..."}
{"text":"So we finally returned to Zipps after staying away for over two months.  What an improvement a few months can make!  It was not perfect, but the staff really went out of their way to make sure we had a good experience.

Everyone got their food except for my husband.  He ordered the Sweet Jalapeño Burger and did not receive it until the rest of our party had already finished our meal.    He was disappointed, but at least three people including our server and the general manager came over to apologize. When he finally received his burger it was delicious and cooked perfectly.

I am so glad that this place has finally gotten it's act together!  We will definitely be back!  I now give it 4 stars!  Much improved from only 1 star a few months ago!  Great job Zipps!"}
{"text":"Good vibe, good music, good beer (32oz) btw. Pool tables great wings (wings aren't as hot as they say, but I'm Mexican lol) chicken skewers are good for happy hour. Also, $1.50 a slice of thin crust pizza. Come here before 7pm and you'll be rating this place like me in no time."}
{"text":"Forget it! They have some good menu items, but nothing spectacular. It is outrageously noisy on weekday nights with very few patrons. Zipps in Chandler is trying too hard to be a 20-something Mill Avenue bar, when their week night customers are 30- and 40-year-olds. I expect a noisy bar with loud music on a Friday or Saturday, but who wants to go to a neighborhood bar with your spouse in the suburbs on a Tuesday evening and have to scream over Motley Crue for an hour? 

I did mention the volume level to our waitress and a manager showed up at the table within minutes, but don't be fooled. This was all smoke and mirrors. The manager could care less what we really thought and pulled the old, \"is the volume okay now\" trick during a quieter section of the music. He hadn't touch the volume. It was just as loud as it was previously, if not more so. If he wanted to keep the volume at ear piercing levels, he should have just ignored our complaints rather than lie to our faces. 

Drive the few minutes out of the way and go to Devil's Advocate! The atmosphere, higher quality menu, and friendly staff are well worth it!"}
{"text":"This is a solid 3 star review, maybe even 3.5.  There's some things I absolutely love at Zipps and some things I really don't like.

Let's start with what I love at Zipps.  All of their wings are really good but the golden wings are some of the best wings I've ever had.  The BLT on SDB is also really really good and what I usually order.  The bacon is crispy and not too fatty.  My favorite thing at Zipps is the onions rings.  They are absolutely delicious and it's worth going there just for them.  They have a ton of outdoor seating which I always like.  The service is also very good.  Servers are quick and friendly and check on you often.

What I don't like at Zipps is their burgers.  I know most of you probably think I'm insane because they're known for their burgers but I really don't like them!  They're never cooked properly.  I always order my burgers either medium or medium rare and they always come well done.  It seems like they over-char their burgers too, they always have a strange bitter taste to them.  The chicken fingers are also pretty bad.  They're battered, not breaded and the batter comes out greasy and flavorless.  I think my least favorite item off the menu is their Greek salad.  I really wanted to like it but it was basically lettuce tossed with pizza toppings and Italian dressing.

Overall, the good outweighs the bad for me.  I just avoid the menu items I don't like!  Their menu is big enough that you should be able to find something for everyone's taste."}
{"text":"The husband and I love coming here . We love the burgers ( sweet jalapeño) , focaccias, and the golden wings ! Nothing fancy, but just good food and fun place to play pool or watch a game . Sometimes service is a little on the slow side, but good late night  happy hours !"}
{"text":"This is a great place to watch any sports game in the Central Phoenix area.  The place is huge and has a lot of TV screens playing several different things.  The menu looked like it had a lot on there, normal bar stuff.  The beer selection was great as well.  The only thing that wasnt the best was the temperature of the food.  I ordered fries and onion rings and they were completely cold and all you could taste on the onion rings was the batter.

I will give it another try because it seems like an awesome place to hang out and watch whatever sports game you wish."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that this location has gone DOWN hill!! SLOW, RUDE, service. The atmosphere is tense and not a single smile from the staff. If you need more than 1-1/2 oz of ranch dip for your wings be prepared to pay extra$$. When I choose a place to eat I would like to feel like a guest, not a BURDEN!  I do not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Been here several times and this time it was the worst. I order the wings and waited a while for them. Next I ordered dinner and 10 mins later the dinner comes out but no wings. I ordered the wings as an appetizer so assumed they would come out first like most appitizers do.  I asked the waitress where the wings were and she stated the kitched just started on them. I asked for the wings to be comped since the order was messed up. She went to the manager and he said no. I asked to speak to him and he stated he's not here to give away free food even though they made a mistake. I guess taking care of the customer is not the priority of this Zipps. I for one will not return to this Zipps or any others.  If he was concerned about the bottom line he should know that making the customer happy ahould be priorty. Then i would continue to come and tell others they should go also. So the $9.95 that this manager saved mostly cost this establishment a few thousands over the course of time. Great business decision."}
{"text":"Good bar around the corner for happy hour and sporting events. I love when they combine the 4 TVs in the center into one large TV for football games.  We enjoy the wings and pizza, the cold beer and zipparitas (frozen margaritas that pack a punch, so there is a maximum amount you can order haha)."}
{"text":"Chicken tastes and looks like fish. Staff told us it was chicken, definitely lying to my face."}
{"text":"I would say the best part of this place is the giant beers. :) I ordered the giant beer which was served cold and was delish as well as the Philly rolls. They were a bit disappointing - it's literally  2 egg rolls for $6.50. Not worth it. Simple as that. It was good but not for the price.  
Friend ordered veggie burger and received a fried white rice pattie. She expected a boca burger, or something with actual protein. Yummy but not worth ordering again."}
{"text":"This place can use a better beer selection. Any of these 3 on tap would do: Four Peaks Hop Knot, Guinness, Newcastle. All three on tap would make it the ultimate beer selection.

But, what this place has already though? One of the best burgers in the whole East Valley. These things are jumbo. Well, they come as double burgers; and while I thought they would be small patties, I was wrong. This burger will fill you up! And, every bite of it will shoot electric currents of flavor across your taste buds.

And the fries? Outstanding. They hand cut them, then fry them in magic unicorn oil and sprinkle them with ferry dust. Alright, I made the last two ingredients up, but they're doing something magical to them to make them taste so phenomenal. [Probably just the freshness.]

This burger is so good, I'm adding it to my very short and exclusive Best Burgers list."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous!!  Been there 3 times tried to give a chance. Everybody's always drunk at the bar chairs drinks flowing like crazy. I go last night with family. The little manager cut me off after he tells me that I bumped into the wall coming out of bathroom. I'm disabled with bad reconstructed foot and tendon still healing. I barely had anything. He should have been looking at his regulars he probably lets drink and drive instead of picking on disabled people. Shame on Gilbert Zipps and their management"}
{"text":"The manager went out of his way to right a wrong. Our buzzer didn't go off and we waited almost half an hour to be seated. He checked and found out the devise was a dud. He bought all four of us drinks and guacamole and chips. Way more than most places would do."}
{"text":"Food is very average. Kind of expensive but it is the only sports bar on all of Mill so it is the place to be to watch any type of sporting event. The staff turn over rate is VERY high so I assume management is pretty awful. Each night has a happy hour with different specials so make sure to go during those hours."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for bar food this is the place I go.  The wings are a notch above BW3's and the burgers are delicious and priced fairly.  Reasonably priced, tasty bar food, friendly staff and wall to wall tv's...what's not to like?!?!

The atmosphere is what you'd expect in a sports bar and the staff has always been friendly.  Short shorts and plunging necklines are the standard for the attractive waitresses.  This adds to the experience in our opinion and fits in with the overall theme."}
{"text":"Erica was amazing!! Please go see her! She's so awesome and makes you feel right at home! I will be requesting  her! Thanks Erica for making tonight fun we will see you soon! You really do make this place worth coming to!"}
{"text":"Stopped in around 9p after youth football games for a drink and snacks. Ordered wings and nachos which took an inordinate amount of time to arrive.  While we waited for the food, we had a hard time keeping the waitress interested in making sure our drinks were kept refilled. 

The food items came out together and we immediately dug into the wings.  We'd had these wings at the west side ZIPPs and love them. These however were cold and dry.  We flagged down the next waitress we saw who promptly returned them for replacement. We shifted to the nachos which were equally as cold. Our initial waitress had disappeared and the manager came by to give us a status on the wings.  We advised him the same on the nachos. He proceeded to disagree with us and explained that while he admits the wings sat for awhile before the nachos were ready, the nachos could be nothing short of hot as they were brought to the table with the wings as soon as they were presented for delivery.   Then walked away.  A fresh batch of hot wet wings arrived and were good. 

While we will go to ZIPPS again, our service was absolutely horrible, cold food being delivered a huge disappointment. To top it off, had we not reviewed the bill, they were going to charge us for 2 batches of wings!"}
{"text":"This is me and my husbands go to for wings. They have the best ranch dressing ever!! My husband also loves their 1000 island burger. The service is great!!"}
{"text":"Josh the GM is a pretentious twat with the worst customer service with no idea of customer retention. Clearly his interests was on numbers and not service. I'm going to San Tan across the parking lot with no hesitation. Josh charged me a $6 dollar drink for a game they didn't host! What kind of self proclaimed sports bar doesn't have a football game and charge you a drink in which you didn't drink at all. No business tact on Josh's part, I don't recommend this bar, food or Josh the wanker GM. By the way Brittany the server was clueless much like her team. Poor bar with poor management, I felt discriminated and I'm a white bloke. The end! Go San Tan!"}
{"text":"Surprised this place is still open. Food is not good at all and the few times I went, the service was slow.  If you want good wings in this area I would recommend Native New Yorker or the Vine Tavern.  Sorry, but this place is not good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to meet up both of his sisters here last night and had the rudest bartender. She must have been having a horrible day but the service industry is definitely not suited for her. This Zipps is a great location but I won't be back after being treated so horribly. We rang up a large tab and I was hoping his sisters wouldn't leave a tip because she really didn't deserve one with all the scowls and glares we received from her. She got her tip but we won't be back. Not a way to treat your customers!"}
{"text":"We go to Zipps quite often and usually our food is good and the wings are great.  We decided to get the wings again tonight and they seemed like they were old and refried.  They were overly crispy and didn't have a fresh flavor.  
Great deal on 32oz blue moon however only $6."}
{"text":"Oh Zipps, what can I say. I try to stay away from chains, my kids roped me into coming.  \"their chicken strips are suppose to be the bomb\"

If bomb means greasy as hell and you leave feeling the grease coming out of your pours, then yes they are the bomb. Both my kids ate 1/4 and just ate their fries. I had a club sandwich which was fine. 
I'm sure this place is great for watching sports. I didn't think the happy hour deals were all that exciting to get me to come back. I walk away not a fan."}
{"text":"Zipps is great. I love coming for happy hour. They jave good happy hour food and drink specials. I love.....love...love their Zipparitas, especially the watermelon. But they are all good. Their wings are my favorite, not dry &great flavor. The service is okay depending on the server."}
{"text":"Service was so slow!  We felt like we were on an island.  Three different servers for a 6 person table.  We visited on a Thursday night and it wasn't very busy.   Then at the end we had to tell the server what we got so she could ring it up.  Good thing we're honest....  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good strong drinks, had good happy hour prices. Nachos were above par, the chips, cheese, chicken and jalapeños were great choice. 
Happy hour prices included Tito's vodka. Any place that includes Tito's in their happy hour menu is at least a 4 star in my book. 
We will return here next football game. Great, fun staff, and very cool managers."}
{"text":"Took extremely long to get our food. When we finally got our food, I was very disappointed. Small portions, fries cooked to a literal crisp, and greasy burger. Oh, AND I found a HAIR in my burger. Waiter didn't even seem apologetic, just said she would get her manager. Very, very poor service and not worth it at all. SAVE YOUR MONEY."}
{"text":"Nice to find it open one labor day and glad the servers not complaining about working it. Never heard of the place B4 but my son suggested it along with hockey puck burger place, the Native. I said let's try Zipps.as it is new to us. The place was slow for lunch but families were coming in with the small kids, us too. 
We ordered and it didn't seem too long a wait for the food to come. I will only comment on my meals and what I snagged form others. I had the Bacon and cheese burger which was just great. Double patties of fresh meat, Juicy and nothing like a fast food patty. My fries were from fresh potatoes not frozen which were just fantastic. I snagged an onion ring from my wife's plate and it was good, lightl and crisp but it was cool to the touch which was a turn off. In front of me was a tub of sweet potato chips which were great and i possibly could have eaten the whole thing but was allowed only 1. Hey, It was someone else plate and lucky to get the one. Our only other go to place in that part of town is Teakwoods and now it now has 
competition 
Oh, I don't drink beer that much and was shocked to see glasses the size of pitchers being served.and it made me think of a German beer hall."}
{"text":"Went to zips with my hubby to watch a game. Mind you I was 6 months pregnant. I ordered a lemon aid and he ordered a beer in a large frosted mug. When our drinks came to the table mine has a fly in it and the glass was filthy and my husbands beer had hair draped across the glass. We sent the drinks back and received new ones. Much to my surprise the server and manager were amused by the mishap! We proceed to order food. I order chicken strips and fries. My husband ordered hot wings. He asks the server about the different sauce options and she has zero input. The food comes and it was awful. My chicken was soggy and his wings were under cooked. So nasty!!! Couldn't wait to leave! We vow to never return.... Even if they tore it down and cleaned house I wouldn't ever set foot in this establishment. Thank god I didn't get sick."}
{"text":"I must say that I wasn't thrilled with the Onion rings or the replacement sweet potato ships and I think we were in too early and the oil wasn't hot enough yet.I wasn't there for them but the bacon Cheese burgers and fries.They have the best burgers. Big and juicy. Just the best."}
{"text":"Pretty surprised with the low star rating considering how this community supports his place especially during football season.  Come on guys they got the best wings in town."}
{"text":"This is the second Zipps that my friends, family and I have visited in the past month.  We have chosen Zipps to get together for birthdays to watch ASU football games.  At both Zipps (one on Camelback) we received extremely poor customer service by our waitresses.  They were not friendly and not helpful.  There are many people out of work and I feel that only nice and polite people should be working in the service industry.  We will not visit any Zipps again."}
{"text":"Reasons I keep going to Zipps:

1. Golden Wings
2. Always have food & drink specials
3. Foccaccias
4. Affordable
5. TVs for Sports"}
{"text":"I guess sports just are not my thing, because I am just not a fan of this place really. The chairs are not comfortable the layout is just is not comfortable and the drink specials and selection did not impress me. 

There was a good special on whole pizzas late at night, but this is only good for the value not the quality. They do have a full menu and kitchen with salads, sandwiches and fried goodies. 

There are many large screens and a projector for sports fans. If for some odd reason, you bring your kids there are a few arcade games. There is a patio too for those who enjoy tobacco. 

If you like, a wide selection of Budweiser products, burgers and sports this may be for you. Otherwise, go find a local brewery."}
{"text":"Those golden wings! They taste like they were forged by Chuck Norris! Their golden wings are damn right breath taking.  The wife and I enjoy going there sometimes because I enjoy their burgers too. I usually order the Thousand Island burger, add avocado, mushrooms and bacon. The fries...they aiight, yo. But all in all, the burger is awesome.

The beer here is also really cheap, so that just makes it extra awesome. Furthermore, my single friend (who is kinda weird) said that the girls are kinda hot in there. So that's another plus."}
{"text":"Awesome wings.  Generally great food (love just about any sandwich with half-and-half) - much better than typical sports bar fare.

The service is usually on point and prices are reasonable.   

The only bummer is that it can be pretty damn hard to get in on a football Sunday."}
{"text":"This is a nice clean place. I always look for places I can take both family and friends and this once fits the bill. Surprisingly the pizza is really good! Not spinatos or grimaldi's quality but best of the bar food I've had. Thin crust and they have ground hamburger as a topping, yummy! They also have a lot of games, pools tables, shuffle board and TONS of tvs.  Besides the pizza, I'm a fan of the focaccias. Good place to come during a weekend for sports games."}
{"text":"Worst experience at any Zipps ever. I have gone to a lot of Zipps locations before and this specific location is hands down the worst. 

Food - GOOD. its ZIPPS after all. same menu as with any other locations

Price - same as any other zipps

ambience - decent. again, same as any zipps throughout the valley

SERVICE - WORST of any Zipps. Servers seemed like they didn't want to work. I waited 45 minutes for my fries and 55 minutes for my wings. 


I am a fan of ZIPPS in general but this location is just something else.I have been to this franchise twice and both of my experience are not good at all. Please stay away from this location and go to the closest Zipps instead."}
{"text":"Poor customer service and the food was even worse. I'd heard amazing things about the focaccia but found it basically inedible. They did have lots of TVs and good deals, but unfortunately the service and food don't make those things worth it."}
{"text":"If overpriced, tasteless, poorly prepared, greasy food is your thing, look no further.  My visit here was very disappointing.  My dining companion said he'd been here and it was \"good\".  The place is fairly new, nice and clean, well located, easy parking.  Went at lunch time.  It's not hard to find \"burgers\", everyplace has them, so I much prefer to get something other than a burger.  About all that's on the menu is burgers.  I prefer to get a philly cheese steak (beef or chicken) or french dip.  And virtually every \"grill\" prepares at least one of those items.  Not here... nothing to be found but burgers  or a chicken breast in place of the burger.  So I got a grilled chicken breast and selected the \"cajun style\" option.  Also selected onion rings after inquiring whether they used real onions.

Food arrived.  Nothing special to look at.  The chicken breast was really only half a breast.  Nothing \"cajun\" looking about it other then there was a VERY light dusting of cajun seasoning that added zero flavor and just the slightest amount of extra color.  The garnish was one piece of lettuce and a microscopically thin slice of tomato.  If the bun was toasted/grilled (as it should have been) it was not apparent. The chicken was dry and tough requiring a knife to saw thru it.

The onion rings looked good.  That was all that was good about them.  The \"ring\" of onion was very thin, the \"onion ring\"  was almost all breading.  You could hardly taste the onion at all.  The breading had very little actual flavor.  The main flavor of the onion rings (breading) was of grease that should have been changed out 2 days earlier and therefore gave the rings a somewhat rancid off taste, the only real taste.

Perhaps this was a bad day but from the number of other 1 and 2 star ratings I suspect this is just how the place is - management that really doesn't care to go beyond mediocre as long as the people come in.  I've driven by in the evenings and they seem to do decent business so someone must like mediocre uninspired food.

For the same $$ there are much better places within two miles."}
{"text":"I had been coming here for 10 years. I don't know if they switched management or what happened. Went here with a friend for lunch. We had an hour, so I incorrectly assumed this would be ample time. After 25 minutes, I asked our waitress to check on our food. Without any apologies, she flatly stated, \"We're  busy.\" Another ten minutes pass, still not even our salad or soup. I inquire again, \"I'll check that for you.\" After 40 minutes I asked for a manager. Who, offered no apologies, but stated she would get our food. We waited ten more minutes, for a total of fifty minutes. We finally got up and left, seeing as we had been there for close to an hour without any food or service. Amazing, considering we only wanted the soup and salad. How busy is it that the soup of the day can't be brought out? Worse, was the waitress and management were completely apathetic. I then wrote Zips, and never heard anything back. So, after a week decided my experience might be worth sharing. This also happened about a month ago, but I wrote it off that time as a singular bad experience. With the second occurrence and lack of any follow up with Zipps, it appears as if this is their new business model. I won't be patronizing this establishment anymore. Too bad, it was always a great option.  But, poor service, no food for an hour of sitting and waiting and complete apathy and lack of follow up, make this bar a venue of the past. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone at this point, and was embarrassed that it had been my pick for lunch. Boo and thumbs down to Zipps."}
{"text":"Awesome wings, good drinks, friendly staff, and never a long wait. This Zipp's is by far my favorite location."}
{"text":"Usually zipps has good food and service. Tonight it was very poor service. The food took 45 minutes to cook. And it was not hot and tasted very bland. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"As far as Sports Bars go, Zipps is one of the better ones.  The food @ Zipps is standard bar food.  There are a few items that are pretty good.  The Golden Wings are one these items, along with the Turkey Burger, Quesadilla's, Taco's, and some of the Focaccia's.  The Onion rings are also good and the fries are hit or miss.  Zipps will let you get half and half of Onion rings and fries for the menu items that have fries which is nice.  I hear the burgers are good there, but since I don't eat beef, I really can't say.

There are more than 20 TV's at this Zipps location, so catching a game there is not a problem.  The bar area is a good size and has 2 pool tables and a shuffleboard table.  The seats at the bar, however, are not comfortable at all.

There is also a good happy hour at Zipps.  There is a happy hour Monday through Friday from 3pm-7pm and then another happy hour from 8pm to close every night.  There's various foods and drinks for the 8pm to close happy hour depending on the day.

Overall, Zipps is a clean sports bar with decent food, lots of TV's, and a good bar area."}
{"text":"Zipps is awesome for a sportsbar. They have happy hour from 3-7pm and nightly specials from 8pm-close. On the weekend, their specials start a little earlier... I think around 11am or so. So, pretty much they have specials all the time. Most nights the wings are on the special for $5 a dozen. Golden wings, mmmmm!!! Those things are insane! There are 32oz beers for like $3 bucks, $8 pitchers of Blue Moon (or any other premiums) on Saturday nights... $3 zipparitas, $3 3 olives, $3 jagers... basically different specials of food and alcohol each night. Their burgers are pretty awesome, too. Oh anddd pizookieee!!! or pizza cookie as they call it here. Yummmm...

This location is bigger than others I've been (Camelback and Via Ventura in Scottsdale). However, the specials are the same at all the locations. The food taste the same also. 

They also have pool for $1 each game and a shuffleboard should you wish to play. A music juke box with ehhh... alright songs. Mainly old songs but its nice to browse the selection and play a throwback once in a while. They have TVs all around, too... of course. 

Service is hit or miss. Sometimes its great, sometimes its slow but usually when I'm at Zipps I'm with good company and conversations help ease slow service."}
{"text":"I want one to open in Rhode Island!!!

This is by far my -one of my favorite places to visit when in Scottsdale (second only to In and Out which we also don't have in RI). It's conveniently located across the street from my Uncle's house and is an enjoyable walk in the evening when it's cool out.

Where the outdoor patio is not my favorite (too close to the parking lot), the inside reminds me of a typical sports bar. I love the many flat screen TVs mounted around the bar and restaurant area. I also like the pool tables, although they can be difficult to play on when the bar is crowded.

Three things bring me back to Zipps every time I am on vacation visiting my family: 1) 32 oz. draft beers, 2) the wings, 3) the bacon, cheddar cheese, onion ring, BBQ double burger. When I am in AZ I try to make two visits (at least) to Zipps. One for the burger and one for the wings, sadly I am not capable of eating both in one sitting. The beer is always ice cold. The wings are always crispy, hot and delicious. My favorite is to order them dry with the buffalo and blue cheese on the side. In my experiences with the burger described above, I have never been disappointed. The patties are always juicy and cooked just right, the bacon is never burnt and the BBQ sauce is excellent.

I'm actually getting hungry as I sit here writing this. I seriously cannot wait until I plan my next trip to Arizona, it cannot come soon enough!!!"}
{"text":"Alright so here's the thing....
In a word...... epic!!!!!

I can't begin to explain the epicness that is Zipps....
What's the power behind this epicness???
Answer: The epic staff every time.

So, shout outs immediately go to the dream team of the following people:
1. Mary - just makes every experience awesome every time.
2. Genevieve - always make me feel welcome.
3. Kayla - Awesome presence, epic personality, attention-to-detail, this list can go on and on. Awesome waitress so good times ahead.

If you're not coming in here to experience the epicness that is Zipps then please do so.

Return customer to this place? Most definitely."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents and daughter. It's a typical sports bar. The atmosphere was typical and nothing special. They do have a nice setup if you want to watch a game. They also have the PAC 12 network so that's great! The food is mediocre. I ordered a chicken sandwich and fries. The fries were kinda soggy and the sandwich was ok. Service was a little slow and we had to flag our waitress down a couple times for drink refills. The best part of this place is the beer and the TVs. Good for watching a game but that's it."}
{"text":"It's Zipps! The service was just as good as the one in Scottsdale. The fries were just as tasty and the wings were just as hot. This location is brighter which is a plus and their appears to be more seating? Or maybe it is just their set up. But again it's Zipps!!"}
{"text":"I love this place for happy hour or watching the game, usually happens to be pro or college football for me. They have good beer specials and wings are great (golden style medium hot). 

I haven't had too many of the menu entrees, but I have had some of their \"focaccia\" sandwich things and they are pretty good. I personally wasn't a fan of the sweet potato chips we got on the side once though. 

All in all a good sports bar, great happy hour/specials, and great wings. It's one of our go-to's to catch any sports games."}
{"text":"Love Zipps for their wings. They are fabulous!!! Burgers good as well. I love that that the water and soda glasses are big.
Wish the mozzarella sticks were breaded like normal. Instead they use something like what an egg roll is made out of.  Chips, salsa and guac are bland but not terrible.
I have to give a shout out to Tasha our waitress on 6/7/16 around 7pm to 8pm. She was amazing! Very attentive, Water glasses always filled. Great bubbly personality to boot!  IMO one of the best waitresses I have encountered."}
{"text":"Our food was great, atmosphere was good, service was amazing! Pretty good specials. We had two servers during the course of being there, Chelsea and Miranda, they took great care of us."}
{"text":"This place always seems to be busy so that is a good sign as far as I'm concerned. It's a sports bar... = greasy snacks and beer + lots of tv's to watch games. A good casual place to hang with some friends and gain a couple of pounds LOL. Appreciate this place for what it is."}
{"text":"Went in and orders the buffalo wings for lunch. The wings were raw near the bone. I picked off a little of the cooked meat but then decided it was too risky to eat. I sent back a few partially picked at wings, one completely raw and bleeding and about 5 I didn't even touch. The waitress apologized but then I received my check for it...full amount. If the food is raw and inedible, why would they charge me? Pray I don't get sick from the few I picked at."}
{"text":"This is the worst Zipps location. We started coming here when it first opened and it was great! Good service, fantastic wings (which is why we loved Zipps in the first place), and then within the past year  something happened.  The customer service went to hell. On 4 different occasions we have had horrible experiences. During the summer when there was  maybe 4 to 5 customers in the ENTIRE place our food took 30 minutes+ to arrive. The bartenders now have huge attitudes. The wings are now soggy and greasy, not at all crispy like they used to be.We used to be longtime and dedicated customers. We also noticed that it hasn't been busy like it used to be when it first opened. Our last time was Friday when the bartender couldn't be bothered to help us let alone be even remotely friendly. And, again, the wings were incredibly soggy and greasy. We're officially done with this place."}
{"text":"Your average Sports Bar with decent food. Had Wings and Chicken Skewers and both were good. No Heineken so I settled for Dos Equis on tap which tasted a little weaker than I am used too. Service was good."}
{"text":"The waitresses were nice and very courteous, but the amount of time time it took to place our order was a bit extreme. Also, the length it took to get our food, which was an abysmal meal, was ridiculous. They have great happy hour specials, but I'll probably never return to dine. Probably just for drinks."}
{"text":"We like Zipps, but they've gotten rid of all their good beer. Bring back some hoppy IPA's on draft, NOT in a bottle and we'll come back. This used to be our place to go for good beer and OK food...now, we'll find a different spot since the beer is lacking."}
{"text":"I've been to this location for 6 years now and the service continues to decline. I started going to the tavern pub a mile a way and have noticed many of the old customers that used to frequent zipps have stopped going for the same reason I have and are going elsewhere. A simple request to put the volume on the us open was refused by the manager but not by any explanation but by a laugh and quote - \"we don't pit the volume on golf\" and walked away. You have lost my business and many others  by managements shortsightedness."}
{"text":"Best wings in town and love coming here for sporting events. The workers are always super friendly and of course....... The food is awesome. Medium golden style wings are highly recommended"}
{"text":"This place is horrible!! I don't even want to leave this one star. Went there, had horrible food horrible service. The night time lady manager should not be working in the industry. We had a free desert of our choice from a previous incident from a different manager and this lady refused to honor it. If it wasn't for alcohol this place would be out of business. Seriously horrible everything. Will never give that place another dollar of mine again"}
{"text":"So I have re-evaluated my experiences at Zipps in Gilbert and I have decided that I should really update my review. I LOVE ZIPPS. Great happy hour. Great bar food. Great service. Great management and employees. One employee specifically, ERICA, always provides the best service imaginable. Go to Zipps, find Erica, and tell her that Tim sent you."}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars I would. I visit zipp's frequently and every week during football season. This evening instead of going to zipps we elected to order food and go pick it up. Unfortunately after getting home and beginning to drink and enjoy the Sunday night football game. We discovered that 2 of our 3 orders of chicken wings were raw inside and inedible. After calling and speaking with Alonzo the manager on duty I was informed that they do not issue refunds. That I must drive back (20 minutes) after drinking and return the undercooked wings and they would make me new wings. This policy is completely ridiculous. Zipps has already inconvenienced me by ruining the food, now they expect me to drive back and return the raw wings. Zipps needs to rethink their ridiculous policy. At this point I don't want new wings, I already ingested raw chicken. Never order takeout from zipps, just not worth it. 

After receiving a response from Tiffany D at Zipps, there will be no chance of ever returning to zipps. She could educate us on proper food handling? Or the trip home could have altered the taste of the food. This is absolutely ridiculous, the trip home would not cause the food to uncook. And I do not need educating on safe food handling, their cooks do."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the wings in this place.  Both the golden extra hot and regular extra hot are some of my favorites on the planet (they are really hot though).  Try a mix of both for a different kick.

The other menu items are tasty and high-quality also.  In particular their fried cheese sticks in wonton wrappers are simply awesome and worth a try.

Of course, being a sports-type place, avoid the game times unless you like noisy crowds.  Otherwise the place has a decent noise level and the service is fast and efficient."}
{"text":"The only reason to go here is if your favorite team is playing a game. Slow, loud and the food isn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"Slow service after being seated and to get drink and meal. Menus and table dirty and sticky.  This was our first and last visit.  Blue moon with orange slice delicious."}
{"text":"Friendly service, lots of TVs...food and drinks not so good. Wine is not good, I know...what did I expect?! I even lowered my expectation, but still...chicken skewers are usually good, but tonight they were tough, and one was raw on the inside. French fries were soggy and burnt at the same time, how does that happen?  They should serve steak fries if shoe string fries are not their specialty. The patio is great, love the fire pit and the atmosphere is fun.   This is my neighborhood bar so I'll come here again but it's not my favorite place to go for food and drinks.. :("}
{"text":"Perfect view of the game...no matter where you sit. It's hard to screw up beer, especially when they have great deals going on all week.. It's  a busy and happening place....which speaks for itself, right? I'll definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"One of the busier Zipp's locations I've been too and I can see why! Service is spectacular and the restaurant is always clean despite all the crowds. Their happy hour is on point from 3-7pm which features drink and food specials. They also have a reverse happy hour that changes daily and a weekend 11-4pm menu. The food is what you'd except from a bar, but really I go for the decent draft list and zipparitas (limit 3!). I'm disappointed they don't also leave the TouchTunes box on because I already have the credits and they are interchangeable- boo!"}
{"text":"my husband and I went here for Happy Hour tonight. The waitress was very nice and attentative but the food on the other hand was awful! My husband had 3 grease filled slices of pizza and I had a greasy burger with onion rings and fries that were way too salty and inedible.We really wanted to sit outside in the nice weather but the patio is only for smokers so we had to sit in the loud and crowded restaurant ugh! I cannot believe we payed $25 dollars for grease filled food! We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Good place for casual family dinner when  you want to watch the game. Plenty of TVs. Great atmosphere. We also come here often with sports teams after games and practices. - the do a great job of serving big groups and never seem  to mind splitting checks by family.  The wings are the highlight.  Beer is always cold. And coolie skillet makes a great closer."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for pregame lunch and drink.  Had the club salad and it was very good.  They also have a free bus to Salt Rivers Fields to catch a spring training game.  Would definitely recommend for easy game parking and food was quality."}
{"text":"We live just blocks from this place but hesitated to go because of the many bad reviews. But we tried it tonight and were delighted. The bartender did say the place had gone through some ups and downs, so maybe they're on the up right now. I had the Thousand Island burger and my crazy wife actually tried the peanut butter burger. They were both really juicy and tasty - two nice sized patties. We search for good burgers and these go down as toward the top of the pack. My wife had the sweet potato chips as her side (more than she could eat), which were just right. I had the onion rings (a pile of them), slightly too crunchy but tasty and not at all greasy. The well whisky ($3.00 at happy hour time) was iffy but got better with melting ice. My Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout was from a bottle, but a deal for $5.00. The service was cheerful and fast... the bartender even remembered both our names throughout the evening. In the end, a beer, a drink, two really good burgers, fast and friendly service - all for $30. Not bad. Not bad at all. And when the service and food are excellent, it's a great experience overall. Might just make this place our go to bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"I've made a review about Zipps before, so expectations are not high. The food is good and an easy spot when watching sports, so we keep going. Pretty sure this is the last straw for my hubby and his buddies. (This review is from him because he doesn't have a Yelp account). Him and his boss went in for lunch a couple days ago. They stand at the front and didn't see the sign that said \"seat yourself\". 2 servers walk by, make eye contact, just keep walking. Finally, they notice the sign and sit down. 10 min later, waitress comes over. Maybe in her 40's older waitress, had an attitude from the start and acts like they ruined her day by sitting in her section. They, at this point, had already figured what they wanted. They both wanted the same exact order. Beer, sweet jalapeño burger, sub side salad instead of fries. Hubby very clearly said \"we both want the same thing\" and ordered. Waitress then looks at his boss and says, \"you want the same thing?\" He says yes, and can we get the salads out first? She then looks at both of them and says, \"is this a joke???\". No idea what the deal was, both guys were so confused. Nope, no joke. Then took 45 min for food to come. (They almost just left) She brings salads first and very sarcastically says \"here's your salads... Out first.. Like you wanted them!\" They never saw her again until they had to flag someone down to pay. Zipps, get your service together.."}
{"text":"First time there.  Nothing to be uber excited about.  Good drink prices.  Decent pub grub.  Decent ambiance.  Not great, not bad.  Bartender had a good personality, at least she acted like she was there for more than just a paycheck unlike some places."}
{"text":"Much like the Zipps off Camelback, this one is a triple threat: Great bar food, excellent happy hour deals, and TV's in every direction. Every time I've been here, there's been a slight wait. Good thing there's the bar area. 

In case you needed a Happy Hour reminder:
$1.50 Pizza Slices
$2.75 Well Drinks/House Wines
$3 Zipparitas (limit 3 -they're good and strong)/Premium Pints (Dos Equis!)
$3.75 32oz Domestic Drafts
$4 Chips, Salsa, and Guacamole (classic starter)
$6 Wings or Chicken Skewers (get the medium GOLDEN wings)

Some downsides of this location are the lack of dedicated parking and the unfortunate patio. The lot wraps around and shares spots with the not-so neighborly CVS. Get here early on game day because it will fill up fast. Also, the patio could be so much more. The TV's were quite aged and inaudible. It is quite obviously a dedicated smoking area. And the smokers are getting no love."}
{"text":"Brought my folks here from CA. Totally disappointed. Food took over 45 minutes to arrive, and the order was all wrong. We asked for waters three times and never revived them. I spoke with the manager and she told me \"I'm sorry\" and walked away. I will NEVER come back. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere with better service and food."}
{"text":"We go here often. Always the same. Very good wings and great drink specials. Great place if you have kids in the group because is very loud. If you child gets unruly for 10 or 15 seconds nobody seems to mind. Did I say very loud? If you want a quiet relaxing dinner, this isn't the place."}
{"text":"Zipps is a great place to meet friends for a drink and have some incredible food while watching the game. The eating area as well as the bar is surrounded with TV's making it easy to find the one you are looking for.

By far the best food on the menu are the Golden Medium Wings. I like spicy food but the Golden Hot are a lot to handle for 10 wings so the medium is my choice for a great blend of spice and flavor."}
{"text":"We were out enjoying a casual Saturday and stopped in for lunch.  Knew nothing about this place but the food was great.  We just had a bacon cheeseburger and a buffalo chicken focaccia....They were both generous in size, fries were hot and fresh.  Only had water to drink so cannot comment on the drink or beer pours.  Service was good.  We would return and give it another go.  Enjoyed sitting on the patio people watching."}
{"text":"The wings were good...the waitress said the hot would make me cry and sweat but it was my even close...if you like hot food the hot isn't even really that hot...they were good though and the service was good...good happy hour prices too"}
{"text":"Our favorite spot during football season especially. Everyone is so friendly and the food awesome. We always get the wings and the wonton wrapped cheese sticks with are awesome. Burgers are delicious and the ziparitas are too."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the burgers and the appetizers. The drinks were good and reasonably priced. The service is a little slow and less attentive than it could be. However I enjoyed the experience and I would definitely return. Many televisions to watch sports."}
{"text":"Management needs to be educated (and educate staff) on CURRENT Arizona  liquor laws for proper identification for alcohol. Vertical out of state drivers licenses are acceptable forms of identification and that information is readily available with a 30 second google search. Won't be bringing my business here any longer."}
{"text":"I love this place. The chicken club is an amazing fried chicken cutlet sandwich and the fries are so friggen good! Great service!"}
{"text":"Overall I really like Zipps Sports Grill.  The food is pretty good.  I really like the wings and my wife enjoyed the Chicken Fingers.  The best part of Zipps is there Zipparita's.  They are awesome, but be careful because the can hit you hard.  I suggest having 2 at most.  We've always had good service.  Overall if you are looking for a laid-back place with decent food and drinks, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"My favorite thing on the menu is the buffalo focassia with half fries and half onion rings. The price is right for the amount of food you get! I always leave with leftovers. If you are looking a casual American atmosphere this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Only come here if you want wings and cheap beer. The menu food is horrible. We got the chicken club and it was rubbery and overly greasy, the fries were old and soggy. I would recommend never to get food here.  Also, The service is terrible. We got our utensils, water, napkins, and menus removed when our food came and it was from a different waitress not our own.  There are better sports bars in the valley."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday night and sat at the bar. Was greeted right away. Good service, great drinks (had a margarita), really liked the cheese pizza at $2 a slice and the multi-view screen was pretty cool. I had no issues here and will be back."}
{"text":"In town for work travel and a friend recommended zips. This is a neighborhood sports bar with plenty of screens. Looks there are plenty of specials each night. I had fish taco, which was served burrito style. I think the special mayo sauce served with it made the bite. Also came with flour nachos and salsa. Friendly staff and just a good vibe overall. If I were local, I'd be a repeat to try other food too (onion rings looked decent)"}
{"text":"Horrible food-the grease was running down the basket from my kids quesadilla. Waited over an hour for food. Server kept blaming kitchen yet all other tables around us were getting their meals. This was middle of summer-not in season when the place gets slammed by kids getting out of their little league games. Worst of all when my husband politely spoke to the manager Sean he did nothing but gave us 2 five dollar Zipp bucks on our $60 bill. CHEAP food and management. Outdated 80's vibe. Our family will no longer patron this place and make sure our friends from our kids leagues know about this. Plenty other great places to go! Stay in the 80's Zipps. Everyone else has moved on."}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised by the poor reviews for this Zipp's location. I've visited other Zipp's across the valley and reviewed one of their central locations. Zipp's has been nothing but consistent from my perspective.

Last night, I got to hang out with a former co-worker and he selected the Zipp's at Ocotillo & Arizona Avenue in Chandler. This appears to be a newer location and it's very clean and well maintained. Plus it has the same character and decor as the other locations. Maybe not as many televisions as in Peoria, but still a solid sports bar.

I've complained about a lot of burgers that I've had at \"burger joints\". I'm not going to do that here because last night, someone in the kitchen cooked me up one of the better burgers I've had in recent memory. I ordered a humble Mushroom & Swiss burger. No one asked how I wanted it cooked, which is fine. I'm accustomed to restaurants killing the burger a second time on the grill due to health department recommendations. My burger (both patties) still had a nice pink color inside. My friend and I agreed that someone in the kitchen knew what they were doing.

And then our server, Hillary, was outstanding. She was friendly, helpful, patient and had great timing! Hillary represented Zipp's well. There is no reason in the world I wouldn't hit this location again the next time I'm in the area. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I don't know why, but I love going here. The service can be hit or miss, but it's just a place where you can go, be comfortable at, get consistently good food, and order a huge ass glass of beer. I crave the jalapeno burger with veggie patties all of the time - it could possibly be the least healthy veggie burger of all time, with double paddies and oozing with cheese - but damn its good."}
{"text":"I've been going to Zipps a lot lately because of the awesome Green Bay Chili Bowls for $5 and the Green Chili Cheese Burger ($6 on the weekends). 

The chili ranks up there as some of the best chili I have ever had. There is an equal amount of beef and beans but there are no onions and greenpeppers in the chili :( . 

The Green Chili Cheese Burger has a roasted Greenpepper slice layed across the top of the burger, making it a very creative and tasty change of pace from the traditional burgers you usually get. I love their fries and they give you a ginormous amount of fries. I would pass on their chicken fingers.

But the service is great and there are plenty of TV's where I saw the Cubs spank the Sox today."}
{"text":"Delicious! 
Mozzarella sticks and Onion rings 4 1/2 stars 
BBQ burger 3 1/2 Stars 
Chocolate chip cookie skillet 4 stars
Hands down the BEST onion rings I've ever had, they are even yummy when they get cold. And let's talk about their ranch dressing....I am NOT a fan of ranch dressing, but their ranch dressing is in a class all by itself....D E L I C I O U S?"}
{"text":"So I have been coming to this location for 5 years. Your wings are the best, the food is amazing and service impeccable. This is our go to spot for family celebrations... From my sons 21st birthday to my youngest sons college acceptance dinner. 
Last night, I had a couple of friends who had never been here and we were having a great night till we came in. We were greeted perfectly and sat. 2 servers approached our table, only 1 introduced herself as Heather. Strike 1. We place our order. Strike 2 came as we had to wait longer than normal for our food. It was not busy, mind you. We finally got our food and as normal, it was delish. My friend ran out of ranch and I had to askthe 2 servers for ranch and my other friend asked for a take home box. They brought that right away but we sat for 15 minutes waiting for the extra dressing. Finally after we sat watching the 2 servers jack around and start taking order on a new table, my friend got up and went over to them. Then we got attitude from Heather.
I was soooo embarrassed because the service was horrible and I talked this place up. I have never in my life not tipped someone till tonight
 I have worked in the service industry since 1988 and I KNOW how important tips are.  So please hear me on this, PLEASE EDUCATE your servers on customer service, dealing with the customer in a professional manner ( even if the customer is being difficult). 

Signed,
A long time customer you just lost"}
{"text":"Stopped to grab a bite to eat with some guest's from out of state. Sat outside due to the music so loud inside. Waitress took our order within 5 minutes of sitting down. We waited an hour and 20 minutes before our order arrived. What took so long? We have no idea,our order consisted of a bacon cheeseburger with a fried egg and fries, 2 chicken breast salads, a BLT and a kid's hotdog. The burger and fries were ice cold and the salads were warm and wilted. I  don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Zipps is your place to go to drink beer, eat bar food, and/or watch a game with friends
. 
Zipps is NOT your place to go if you want to drink craft beer, eat classy food , and/or watch Oprah with a date.

It's a sports bar people. Wings are awesome (love the golden style) and getting a bucket of 5 domestic beers for $12 is all I need to watch the Cardinals lose a game they should have one."}
{"text":"There's nothing more annoying and frustrating than going to a sports bar and they don't even have sports on! Instead they are always playing loud club music. It's 5:30 on a Sunday and the Stanley cup is on... I don't think people are visiting your establishment to get \"crunk\" or \"turnt\". It sucks too because I love the food especially the fries but we had to leave immediately as the raging music caused a raging headache. This is Ahwatukee... Know your audience."}
{"text":"I had the green chile burger and was very satisfied with its flavor.  It was very filling.  The service was not so hot the waitress seemed to be in a hurry and it turned out she was done with her shift."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this Zipps I forget about the terrible time I had before and once again I'll end up getting disappointed again smh. It always takes a long time, the food is always ehh and the service is close to none. Save your money and go somewhere else on mill and you won't regret your decision like I do every time I accidentally end up here."}
{"text":"Great happy hour with a bunch of Veterans of the various services. Great way to spend Memorial Day weekend.  Super Happy Hour food options, drinks and other entertainment in this Sports bar. Lots of TVs and friendly staff made this a great place! Indoor and outdoor seating options."}
{"text":"First off, I am new to Arizona. I had never been to a Zipps in my life. My sister's fiance suggested it to me one night when we were looking to grab a quick beer.

I got there a few minutes prior to his arrival and was immediately greeted by two things. Very attractive hostesses and sports on a multitude of televisions. \"Perfect\" I thought to myself \"two of my favorite things!\" 

I was quickly seated at a table near a group of boisterous, middle-aged women who refused (or were unable to) move their seats in so that I was able to sit comfortable in my seat. I was forced to sit so close to my table that one, if not both my lungs began to deflate. 

The waitress approached and noticed my mounting distress as losing oxygen. She smiled at me and motioned me towards her. I slid out from behind my prison and she took me to another more comfortable table. I ordered my frothy libation and enjoyed its frozen crispness while I waited for my sister's fiance to arrive. 

The waitress engaged in the usual casual banter with me until my companion arrived, making me feel at ease and comfortable. I requested that a game that wasn't playing on any of the TVs be put on a screen by me, and she quickly made sure that it happened. 

Zipps is amazing. It is great for beer lovers, as they have all sorts of different beers (I was pleased to see that they had Magic Hat #9.) And while their \"Golden Wings\" sound like something that R-Kelly would enjoy, they are incredible and if it were at all healthy I would survive off of them for the rest of my life. All of the waitstaff is friendly and obliging and understanding of a person's ability to need to breath and not be crushed to death by a table. I would highly recommend Zipps to anyone for any occasion. I am currently trying to convince my sister that her wedding should take place at Zipps. She keeps going on about some placed called \"Hawaii.\" Zipps would be better."}
{"text":"Nachos were good, but not great.
BBQ bacon burger is so good, as were the side of onion rings.
The giant cookie skillet is the best, but we were too full to order it!
The fries were a bit soggy.  Overall, relaxed sports bar with some tasty food."}
{"text":"I love the strawberry Zipparita and golden medium wings! This place has a great atmosphere if you're looking to watch a game and a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"Golden medium wings are amazing"}
{"text":"I have never been treated worse than I was tonight at this place.  I have been going to this location for as long as I can remember.  All of the employees including the managers are extremely rude! This is not a family place anymore.  We used to be able to bring the family before it gets late and busy... Never again!!! The manager literally tried to get in our faces after we complained of the terrible service.  The food is below average.  The beers are warm.  The booths have springs sticking out.  Avoid this place!! So many other sports restaurants that will treat my family with respect.

Funny how the management will only comment on 5 star reviews but not acknowledge the negative reviews to help their business and bring back loyal customers who were scared away by bad management."}
{"text":"great tv's, good food (for a sports bar) and great service. I wouldn't hold zipps to a high level of expectation like i would halfmoon just because it's a good ole sports bar nothing fancy just a bunch of Tv's and some good wings."}
{"text":"Our server, Cookie, has been fabulous both times that she has served us.  
Unfortunately at our last visit we ordered two orders of wings.  The first order came out as we had asked for them, light sauce, and well done.  The second however did not come out light sauce.  The manager came over after we sent them back, Cookie was very understanding, and he wasn't as understanding.  He offered to re-make them, but said it would take 15min or so.  We were hungry then so said we would just take them to go and ordered a side cease salad because it would be quick.  The manager took the side caesar off the bill, but did not apologize about the wings or seem to care that much.  Have never had a problem with Zipps until yesterday and was definitely disappointed with how the situation was handled by the manager."}
{"text":"By far the coolest feature is their bar tv's literally move and all come together to make one giant screen for big sporting events, during slow times they are all separate running different games. The place can get crowded for lunch but its a great place to go to watch a game after work as well. It can take 30 minutes or longer to get your lunch so plan accordingly especially if they are super busy. Happy hours specials are good! by far the best item on the menu is their burgers, love the blk and blue burger. Also the 1,000 island burger is great as well. you can sub fries for either half onion rings & fries or side salad or even sweet potato fries. Its hard to steer away from the burgers but they also have salads, sandwiches, etc. They even have different meat for their burgers such as chicken and i think turkey.  Also they burgers come w 2 patties if you want just 1 ask, and if you want the greens, tomato, etc ask as well not all burgers come with. Their appetizers are excellent and their wings are highly recommended. They have several local beers and your standard bud, miller in both pint and large mugs."}
{"text":"Service sucks when they get busy. We went there on Friday during the lunch hour. Waited more than 45 minutes for the orders. The manager argued with one of my coworkers when she made a complain that Zipps was not a fast food restaurant. With all the choices on Mill Ave, we won't go back to Zipps that's for sure!"}
{"text":"On vacation, and came into the Zipp's \"Sports Bar\" to watch a Champion's League game, and eat lunch with our family.  We called ahead to see if they would show the game, and after checking they said yes.

When we got there, we had good service from our server, aside from the fact that we had to ask three times to actually have the game put on.  We ate here only because they said they were showing the game.  After 30 minutes, and the game not coming on, I went to the General Manager, and asked him to cancel our food and bill us out for what we had already received.  The GM couldn't make eye contact, and had overall poor customer service skills."}
{"text":"I like Zipps because they have daily food and drink specials, shuffleboard, flat screens tv's, and it's nice inside. I think Zipps has the same frozen margarita machine as Z Tejas because the margaritas taste the same and they will only let you have three. They're awesome make sure you try one next time you go. The only downside to this place is they have the worst bloody mary drink I have every had. The bloody mary mix smells like garbage and tastes like dirt. Its gross. I am obsessed with the nachos here and the rest of the food is pretty standard nothing amazing but good enough to satisfy your drunky munchies."}
{"text":"Got here early to hold a table for 8 people. I was informed by hostess that I had to wait to get a table until I had 4 people with me. The manager came out and stated the same BS. I was seated at a 4 top to wait for my friends. My waitress appeared \"Tara\" who told me she would get us another table. My friends arrived and we were moved to the bigger table. If it wasn't for Tara's \"excellent\" customer service this place would be getting 1 star. Don't show up early and expect to hold a table bc this place won't do it. But if u want good customer service go see Tara \"jets fan\", she is the only reason I would consider going back.."}
{"text":"Looking for a sports bar for NCAA tourney action and food. 

It's a good sized place and lively. Food is ok, typical sports bar food. Service was fine and prices reasonable. All and all a good time. I could see stopping in here again. Plus I bet on a football game day this place is great."}
{"text":"I love going to this place, and I go here very often.  I like to sit outside with my friends, but it takes at least ten minutes for a server to come greet us regardless how full the patio is.  They have great happy hour every single night.  I only come to this place because it has a great patio area and it is in the middle of where all my friends live.  The service is hit or miss.  For the most part, though, the service is pretty terrible.  The servers are not that attentive and are not too friendly.  On the other hand, some of the servers do a great job, but there are only a select few.  I can look around and see other servers having dirty looks on their faces to their tables or to their own staff behind there back.  This is not good for business because it is quite annoying having to wait while the servers solve their drama to get any service when our drinks have been empty for 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Wow incredible service ...we never had a  empty glass. Very attentive but yet not over attentive.  Cold beers with a smile people who were were happy to be here working .Jennifer was great among others there. Brandon the manager came and checked in too.   They have Shuffleboard and pool ,darts and golf music but down enough to where you can talk and not scream .chicken fingers were real white chicken breasts freshly breaded frys were fresh with skins on yummy.tacos not so bad either , guacamole made with fresh avocados"}
{"text":"Super annoyed.  My boyfriend and I (both under 21) have been there more than 3 times after 11 pm to eat and always had great service. This last Sunday we were sitting there at about 10:55 where we placed our order for an appetizer and drinks, then about 10 minutes later our waitress walked up and asked for our id's, to our unknown knowledge you had to be 21 after 11 pm. The manager then came over and explained to me the law and how other managers failed to enforce this, even though he was the only manager that we have ever seen there...awk. 
So they then charged my boyfriend and I for our chips and salsa which we wouldnt have ordered if we would have known!?...the whole thing was annoying."}
{"text":"I have been to Zipps a couple times now. Mostly to watch football. I have never bend disappointed. 

Sometimes there's a wait because it's so popular. So it teaches you to go early before big games. 

But awesome place. Many TVs to watch. Comfy booths. 

Drinks have always been great. And the food!!!! So good! Love their wings. But my fav dish is their chicken strip salad!"}
{"text":"Its a sports bar.. so we got the standrard flat screens, sports team logos, loud noisy crowd, and well beer ! Its alright, the pizza slices are nice, and the food selection is good. Their service is good, nothing that stands out as amazing but hey, its just a bar."}
{"text":"Ever worst sports bar experience ever. pick somewhere else to go. they restrict where you can sit even though their bars half empty. Headed to Twin Peaks."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my father today. He had wings and fries and I had a mushroom Swiss burger. I asked for a side of onions for my hamburger and my dad asked for an extra side of ranch. Food came out quickly since not many people were here at lunch time. When I received my bill I was charged $.50 cents for the diced red onions in a small cup and he was charged $.50 for his ranch! Normally on hamburgers onions come with it and I am paying more for a \"gourmet burger\"! It's not a big deal it's only a dollar but it's the point. Maybe my server should of stated there would be an upcharge for a few onions...and an upcharge for a small cup of ranch! I can see why blue 32 is taking your business. I'm surprised I didn't get charged for the lemon in my water. Won't be back on pure principle!"}
{"text":"I was with my friend today almost 4:00 pm to make happy birthday so we was waiting almost 20 minutes waiting the beer so my friend go to the bar and come with the manager but the manager was so stupid guy he ask for my i.d and never ask the i.d the other guys go to drink over there also he never asking the i.d to my friends and have mustache i have 34 years old and some family go with children at tha bar to drink  he told me need leave but never told the children leave 09/20/2015 also he never asking i want eat something  only to stay  he was very racist men becouse iam latin the manager is so stupid and racust guy need change to other"}
{"text":"This Zipps has my Vote- I go to Several Locations for the Ever so Delic-Zipparita - But they use a Food Runner (Or a Darn good Mgr) to bring your food out When its Ready - Hot & Delic- We love the Honey Med Wings Enuf Sass-& Spice- 1/2 & 1/2 Basket good We go for HH and Call it Dinner.  I sometimes like there Chicken Burger and that Yummy- JapZippySauce -yes  yummy"}
{"text":"Love Love Love Zipparitas !! Happy Hour Zipp's And Honey Wings My Favorite This is First Time to This Location Busy Good Service Thumbs Up!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Annoyed that I left 3/4 of my salad in a to go box for later and I accidentally left it.  When I got to my car, 500 feet away, I quickly drove back to see that they threw it away already.  Then I was told it could be remade if I wanted to wait for 20-25 minutes, FOR A SALAD!!  Lol.  I passed as it was after 11:00 pm and it shouldn't take that long to replace the salad that they threw away, especially when only 3 tables or so had customers in them.  Not busy st all."}
{"text":"The staff is always super friendly, and the service is fast and reliable. The only reason this place does not get 5 stars is that it is too loud all the time."}
{"text":"While we were visiting Arizona this past week, we stopped by Zipps Sports Grill. I wanted and good burger and they delivered. They didn't have a drink menu and I'm horrible at remembering drinks so I showed our waitress Jennifer a drink recipe I snagged a photo of from another restaurant. They didn't have all the ingredients but the manager Jeff came over and asked to see the recipe and he made some suggestions on how to make a drink similar and oh wow it was great!!!! Out waitress Jennifer was attentive and took great care of us. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I really wish my experience at Zipps was good, (I would have even been satisfied with average) but unfortunately it was miserable! We started with chips, salsa, and guacamole. The salsa and guacamole were very bland, and the chips tasted stale. My wife ordered a chop salad with chicken. She said it was the worst salad she has ever ordered! (and she orders salad a lot!) The chicken was rubbery (like it had been cooked in the microwave) and had no flavor, just rubbery texture. About half of the lettuce was extremely soggy. (I'm guessing the salsa that came on the salad had been sitting for too long on the lettuce... yuck!) We also ordered a burger, a kids meal, and a cheese pizza (which our waitress forgot to put in the order.) We received the salad, the kids meal and my burger, and no pizza. Mistakes happen, but when they do I feel the waitstaff should do their best to compensate for their mistake. We were offered nothing. She did ask if we still wanted the pizza? Maybe she thought the two members of our party that ordered the pizza wanted to starve? I tried the pizza, I wish I wouldn't have. It tasted like a pizza you make from a kit in a box. The onion rings that came with my burger were awful! They were lukewarm, and the coating on the outside was chewy. (I have eaten quite a few onion rings in my lifetime, and I've never had an order with a chewy coating. Disgusting!) It's almost like the temp of the fryer was not hot enough, or they had been sitting for too long. My burger was fine. This experience goes down as the second worst meal I've ever had to pay for."}
{"text":"Very unhappy with this place. Spent over $50 on dinner for self, hubby and two sons (19) and (22). After dinner, went into bar area to shoot a game of pool and were asked to leave because my younger son wasn't 21. I find this ridiculous since Arizona law says servers must be 19 to serve alcohol. We were there as a family, weren't drinking and just wanted to have a fun family night. I won't be spending my money here any more."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, but I came here two days in a row to watch my two favorite NCAA mens basketball teams play in the March Madness tournament.  Both days the manager was awesome, and turned the game onto a big screen, and with volume.  He listened to the request being made in his establishment ... by me.  This is very different than BWW, who could care less what I requested, even though I was the only person in the place.  Good cold beer, good food, great staff!  Nice to have in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Waited 1 hour for food, it got here cold and soggy asked management to replace it, only received attitude..."}
{"text":"Lunch on a Saturday, they were NOT busy. However we had to get up and get our own menus after waiting about 5 min. Couldn't get the bartender or waitstaff attention because they were in deep personal conversation. (This happened the entire visit). Worst grilled chicken sandwich I've ever had. Flavorless and very tough. I couldn't eat it. Husbands burger was ok but the bun fell apart (too old maybe?). I've had an ok experience here before ordering wings but not sure I would come back"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials...especially the \"Weekend Hangover\" burgers every Saturday and Sunday from 11am-4pm.  Perfect place to cheer on my favorite Wisco teams with friends!"}
{"text":"I am typically a huge fan of Zipps! I love coming here with friends to enjoy food, drinks, and sports. I have been to many BIG sporting events here. Unfortunately, tonight was a huge let down. Although a couple important games were on, we were seated immediately since many tables were available. For a table of 6, we were given 1 menu and no silverware/napkins. We started by ordering drinks and food immediately. Drinks took 15 minutes, which is somewhat understandable due to the the amount of people at the bar. However, food took 55 minutes to come to our table and we were rarely visited by a waitress. We ordered 3 appetizers, 2 slices of pizza, and a burger. Bringing out appetizers after almost an hour is unacceptable. Our checks were not split up after requesting multiple checks and we had to reiterate our orders to the waitress since it was not originally noted what each of us ordered. After speaking with the manager, he explained they were understaffed and offered an apology. We were also given a generous discount on each meal which we were more than thankful for. All in all, we will most likely pick a new spot for sporting events after tonight's experience."}
{"text":"Great sports bar! Plenty of TVs, indoor/outdoor seating, full bar, fair selection of beers on tap and bottled. The atmosphere is what you might expect of a sports bar- loud. So don't come here if you want to enjoy conversation. But on the plus side, if you have loud children, this is one restaurant where it is no problem. Also, service is fast and friendly, so no waiting when the kids are reaching nuclear detonation. Food is good, no complaints. The skillet brownie is worth skipping dinner altogether."}
{"text":"I have spent plenty of time at sports bars, and Zipps usually leaves me disappointed. I only go here to meet people. The food is average for the most part, but with some items like the chips, salsa, and guacamole and the soggy french fries that do not even hit the baseline for quality. The service here also needs work. It was slow, and the server did not do the best job of listening, but I can take some of the blame for not being louder in a busy restaurant. There are a good amount of TVs here, so it is a good place to watch a game if you can get a table near the center of the restaurant. The view isn't great from the booths."}
{"text":"We go to this Zipps when the kids' Little League season starts up.  I don't like the Zipps on Greenway, we had horrible service there and if you get stuck being sat facing their front door when the sun is West, you are screwed.

Anyway, their Foccacia sandwiches are soooo good!  I can never choose which one I want.  Their cookie skillet is to die for.  The happy hour is good.  Plus, there are always kids there with their family, so it's almost like all the kids keep each other entertained.  

I'm super picky about my cocktails, so if you don't like beer (like me), then you are stuck here.  I ordered a mai tai last night and it was really bitter.  They don't have a blender, so you can't get like a pina colada or anything like that.  My 2nd drink was a strawberry margarita which was okay, kinda salty.  

I always feel bad for the servers because I don't think they have set sections and they are always running their butts off between the patio and dining area.  Sometimes if you need something, you may have to wait or the server may come off as irritated.  But I'm a server too, so I understand their pain.  Also, they never introduce themselves.  

They get three stars because of the drinks (or lack thereof).  Send your bartenders to a training class!  Or get a recipe book."}
{"text":"It's close. It's fine. It's not
My favorite and it's not the worst.
Service is fine.
Beers are cold.
I think we desire a sports bar that has a little bit more grit to the tire. It's a bar and grill with a sports theme is a better way to put it. Night Playoff basketball - no sound, day playoff baseball - no sound, afternoon football - no sound. I mean everyone is polite and ya I get it other people are there to eat and drink and watch other games...but your atmosphere is set at 90s top 50. The patrons aren't coming for that. If you go to a sports bar one would be amiss if you are mad because sports sounds are on around you in the playoffs. Lol. We will still come here regularly and drink and have fun and not me bad."}
{"text":"Met a friend (who was in town from Denver) here for dinner. Pretty good place. Love sports bars & the food here is delicious. I was very impressed. My friend has eaten here before on previous trips, so she recommended it. 

The only thing I didn't like was having to walk 4 blocks since parking in Tempe SUCKS, especially since everywhere has parking meters. Hence my rating of 4 stars out of 5."}
{"text":"I feel like this Zipps is still trying to get it together.  

I frequent a few of the other Zipps around town, and whenever I step into this one (which happens to be closest to my home) I just feel ignored and a little sad.  It just doesn't have that... feel... it's hard to explain but this location is usually my last resort.

One star for zipparitas which make me forget about the bad service.  One star for sweet jalapeno.  Sweet jalapeno is nectar of the gods.  FACT."}
{"text":"Zipps is a great sports bar.  Drink are very reasonably priced.  The wings are phenomenal!!!  Their extra hot wings are actually hot...which is awesome!  To be honest, even their hot wing have a kick to them.  They have great happy hour specials and also have reverse happy hour starting at 8 PM.  All of the food I have had there is good.  The staff is always friendly.  With multiple locations...great place to catch a game."}
{"text":"I only need to say three things. Monaco foccacia, happy hour, and 32oz beers."}
{"text":"I'd rather go through life uncircumcised than ever eat here again.  I realize it's a Sports' Bar but, \"c'mon man!\"  Zipps is doing Sports' Bars across the world a disservice!  I came here with the intentions of simply fattening my ass with some bar grub.  However, they managed to screw up onion rings and fries.  How the hell does someone screw those items up?  Those should be 'Simple Simon' for any place that serves food, period!  The onion ring batter was thick and disgusting and on top of that, were not cooked correctly!!  The fries tasted as if they made a huge batch of them and let them sit out for a long time so that they could be quicker during service.  Unacceptable and it shows the pure laziness that the \"back-of-the-house\" exudes! 
Even the booths felt as if I was sitting on top of about 3,387 buried farts.  

I prefer to end a review or any other body of writing I create on a positive note and will say that our waitress was very nice and on top of everything.  I give it 5/5 stars for service.  I just wish that the kitchen would cook like they actually give a rat's ass and I hope that the food doesn't have me imprisoned to the bathroom..."}
{"text":"The salsa has had cross contamination, TWICE now and all the bald manager does is crack JOKES.... DISGUSTING!!!!"}
{"text":"After a quarter of football waiting for our server to take our order, we were shocked and amazed to find out that a simple vegetarian sandwhich which is not an option on the menu would be 11 dollars. Luckily the cheap flagon of domestic beer helped fill me with empty calories instead of the avocado, goat cheese and mushroom sandwhich that I asked for. The waitress didn't ask me if I wanted anything else. I went hungry but survived on cheap beer. Good thing I'm not driving home."}
{"text":"Started off with a hair in our water.. I ordered the chicken focaccia and it was just chicken with sauce on bread. No lettuce tomato or anything. Fries were good and my husband said his wings were good. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Not happy.  However, I do give credit to the mgt for not charging my cc card.  Very slow.  Burger is less than a McDonalds quarter pounder and less tasty.  They brag it's not a $12 burger, but let me tell you it's the worst $6.50 burger ever.  Manager came to table to inform us the order had only been 20 min and insisted burger was \"standard\".  Well, your \"standard\" is too low for me.  Also, it was 20 min post-order when our waitress asked us what we ordered.  20 min after that we got our food.  Even the beer took 10 min and we were in the bar.  They think this area is desperate for them....and maybe we do need a sports bar, but not this bad."}
{"text":"On a busy saturday night with plenty of sports action I never expect a mind blowing experience at any bar. Took some time to get a table but the host was quick in getting our orders and bringing drinks. Food was nice and the 8pm to close specials are a good deal. Overall a fine experience. I would take 1 star away just because it took lot of time to get a table and we had to find a table by ourselves in the crowded bar. Kind of understaffed."}
{"text":"I am normally very generous in my rating and this is no exception.  We have been to Zipps at least 10 times times and as long as you are ordering drinks, it is ok but when you add food it is REALLY hit or miss, mostly miss. The food is not bad, once you get it. It is rarely warm and prepared the way you request. The excuse is ALWAYS \" the kitchen is back up\". Really too bad Zipps, you could really be a great place but you have proven time and again that you cannot get it right."}
{"text":"Excellent service. The manager Shannon was very attentive and the margaritas on the rocks with grand marnier were excellent! Best neighborhood hang out!"}
{"text":"It's just flat out tough to beat their happy hour specials.  Draft Beer and Zipparitas are well priced and their wings are pretty tasty.  I'd give them a 5 but they aren't quite as great when happy hour is over and although I love their Monaco Focaccia I'm not the biggest fan of their fries/rings.  I started going with a side salad instead."}
{"text":"I'm ashamed to admit that this was my first time in a Zipps...especially given it's close proximity to my house. Now that I've been, I know with absolute certainty that it won't be long before I go back.

Our visit took place on a Saturday night, with some pretty big time college games on the docket. Somehow, we managed to get front row parking. Though, if we weren't able to land such primo parking, I'm not sure how far we would have had to venture before we found a spot. The lot immediately in front of the restaurant is VERY small...probably no more than 25 cars small. 

Not knowing exactly what to expect when we walked in, we were greeted with an absolute explosion of sound. It's strange...from the outside, you couldn't tell how loud the sound system would be...so, kudos the the sound dampening AND the acoustics. 

As we were seated, I took a look around. We passed a shuffleboard table http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zipps-sports-grill-scottsdale-5?select=u-m26ObDOkWXRkWMRi13hA#31oNdkKqDaB1eXMcdAfQIA, directly across from a full bar. In the back, there are banks of booths for seating, all surrounding a nice-sized billiards table. At the end of the bar, there was the token \"feed me money while you drink\" bar games machine. I haven't played this one, though I have played MANY like it in the past. I'm sure this one will soon taste the fury of my quarters and drunk fingers. Directly behind the video games, they also have an electronic dart board to round out the gamut of pub games http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zipps-sports-grill-scottsdale-5?select=u-m26ObDOkWXRkWMRi13hA#EU84a1qFhSVZo8INtRRiSg.

We made it to our booth, where the five of us sat and met Katie, our server (we had the in-laws with us, in case anybody was keeping count). Katie was extremely enthusiastic about her job, making sure to remind us of her name every time she stopped by. I originally thought she was overdoing it, but she's one of very few servers whose name I actually remember. So, hats off to Katie.

While we were ordering our meals, we had access to an absolute bevy of televisions from which to choose to watch the games. I had my back to the bar, and I could see four t.v.s from my seat alone. I'm pretty sure we counted at least a dozen t.v.s total.

I made the pleasant gaffe of asking Katie what the largest size beer they had available. Come to find out, they have 32 oz glasses http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zipps-sports-grill-scottsdale-5?select=u-m26ObDOkWXRkWMRi13hA#AcbqTlhTjSLQs2AGnokY_Q. Two of them later, I was very glad I wasn't the designated driver...though, I wasn't too bad off to realize how good my meal was.

I can only speak for myself on the meal portion. Looking over their menu, I noticed that they allow you to make your own burger. They also give you the option to choose from beef patties, turkey patties, or ever chicken patties! I asked about the thickness of the patties, as they offer either a single or double burger option. As it turns out, the patties are relatively thin. So, if you're hungry, spring for the double patty...it's only about a dollar more, still coming in at under $9.00 for the whole thing http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zipps-sports-grill-scottsdale-5?select=u-m26ObDOkWXRkWMRi13hA#vCWfGZqjbSHoDNbjAt1OIA.

I had two of the behemoth beers, and my wife another. My in-laws each ordered some ridiculously large salads, along with two glasses of Chardonnay. My wife got a MASSIVE club sandwich (seriously...I have no idea where they baked this bread...it was ridiculous). My daughter, of course, got the grilled cheese. The check, after tip, came in under $90.00. 

Now that we know about this place, I can absolutely foresee us becoming regulars. Even though it's a restaurant, it has that hometown bar feel to it. An upscale dive bar...if that makes any sense. Whatever the case may be, I recommend it."}
{"text":"First, it pains me to see how far this location has fallen.  I really enjoyed coming to Zipps and supporting the young staff who work so hard.

Both my children as well as my son-in-law worked at Zipps/Gilbert for many years and were highly regarded by the management staff and customers alike.  This was during the Jeremy/James/Scottie management era's.  The location was clean and the staff was always on their toes.  The standards were high and the kids made a nice buck but worked very hard to earn it.  They even had 'secret shoppers' that would evaluate them anonymously.

On to my review of the current Zipps/Gilbert.

We were there on Wednesday evening to watch game 2 of the World Series.  The mens restroom was a mess at 5:00 pm.  Water (or I hope it was) on the floor, full garbage cans, burnt out light bulb, and the floor was sticky like a move theater..  This is not the first time, and usually at least one of the two paper towel machines is empty or broken.  This seems to be the norm rather than exception.  

Most of the servers are excellent as they know us as 'regulars'.  I had a couple horrible experiences earlier this year, but just made sure to get the name of that server and refuse to sit at one of her tables (I actually waited once because the only available table was assigned to her).  We've also had several occasions over the past 6 months where we were seated at a table that had not been wiped down and was sticky and had remnants of food from the previous customers.

We've also noticed they tend to run out of 'cold' 32oz beer mugs more frequently.  Again, these are not isolated incidents.  Oddly, It seems to have nothing to do with customer traffic because it's happened a few times on 'dead nights'.

The food is hit/miss.  To be honest, it's been that way as long as I can remember.  In the past, at least one manager would oversee the food and send it back if it didn't meet their expectations.  It doesn't 'feel' like that is happening today.

The two recently failed restaurant inspections are proof of how poorly managed this location is.  4 violations in June, and 5 in September.  A couple of them probably explain why our stomachs have hurt after recent visits.  

Zipps is a great venue to enjoy a relaxing night out.  The prices are good (especially during happy hour/specials) and most of the staff is great.  The food, for a sports bar, is reliable and what you'd expect.  The menu choices are getting a bit stale but this is not a 'foodie joint'.  There are plenty of TV's and room to meet up as a group.  However, the steady decline in cleanliness and attentiveness by the management is leading us to choose alternative establishments.  I would expect the ownership would be mortified if they randomly checked in and experienced what we have been seeing for many months."}
{"text":"We have frequented Zipps/Gilbert for many years.  Some quality issues led us to try this location.  Simply put...THIS is what Zipps is all about.  Outstanding!  The location is well managed!

Our experience tonight is what led us to be long time patrons of the Gilbert location.  The food was as good as we've ever had at Zipps (or Goldies).  

Years ago the kids worked at Zipps so they have very specific ways of ordering their food.  This time it was focacia's and customized with lots of subs...pretty comical to hear them order.  Simply put...they nailed it.  Their order was perfect...even better than they would get when they worked at Zipps.

We ordered golden medium wings, extra crispy, extra saucy.  Nailed that too.

Our server Kaycee was excellent...friendly, great pace/timing, could not ask for more.  The rest of the staff seemed 'on it' from the hostesses to the bussers.  The table was cleared appropriately, food delivered hot and fresh, etc.  Even noticed the manager running food to tables.  Well run location. 

We hope our local Zipps gets their act together.  Until that happens, we will make the trek to this location when we need our Zipps fix."}
{"text":"Ok sports bar, good happy Hour values.  Wings and the usual sports bar food.  Food quality is good but salad and vegetarian choices are limited, but available.  Beer by the pitcher.  Some customers get to loud and use loud foul language which the staff seems to tolerate so be aware if you take the kids."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since I've been to a Zipps. The food has gone down hill. I know to go food is never the same as eating in the restaurant, but I live ACROSS THE STREET. It should still be edible though. I gave them 3 stars, because the bartender was very pleasant while I waited for my food to be completed."}
{"text":"Great place and awesome serviceBeers were big and cold, had fun playing shuffle board. Would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Busy day so stopped in on weekday for a quick bite.  First time.  About half full.  Noisy, but hey, it's a sports bar!  

Fish n chips (had salad instead of chips) B+
Fried chicken salad. b+++

Happy hour margarita type drink......yum.

Heard their pizza is very good.

We'll be back"}
{"text":"They forgot my order:( but had good zipparitas!!! Service is very weak, the food is ok, but the drinks are legit! FRIDAY nights are not recommended, since there are WAY better places to be at, but when your desperate for grub after 11PM & before 11:58PM this lace can serve hot food, with alcohol!!! LOL!!!"}
{"text":"Went for drinks on Monday night, April the 7th. Place had a young, hip crowd. Drinks were legit, the flat screens were sufficient, and the ambience was nice. Sat over at the outdoor patio where I dropped a wad of $20's. The waitress was honest enough to point out the loose bills on the floor. She was a cute, energetic, brown haired, slim gal w a pearly white smile who said, \"I would just die if you lost your money!\" Im pretty sure her name was Erica (I was a bit under the influence).

She could've taken advantage but didn't. What a sweetheart! All bars need waitresses like that."}
{"text":"Great and friendly staff ready to serve you, along with good happy hour deals from 3-7 on weekdays as well average deals 11am-4 on weekends. Spacious, it has shuffle board and a pool table with a nice long bar to complement it all."}
{"text":"great vibe in general throughout the restaurant. only problem is the food. fries were soggy. onion rings were terrible. probably could've gone to a different sports bar on mill with better food."}
{"text":"We walk in, completely respectful & calm (because if we were belligerent, I'd understand what happened next) but didn't even get past the bouncer. He checked all of our ID's (My friends are visiting from San Diego so obviously they all have California ID's) & was fine, until he got to the last one which was the older one so it still had the red stripe saying \"21 in 2011,\" which the bouncer said was unacceptable by Arizona law. Um, 1) it's 2014 (which makes him 24), 2) your bar is empty, 3) it's worked EVERYWHERE else, including the place we went to after being turned away from here. The bouncer was so rude (in his 20's, blonde with a goatee/beard) for no reason. I get that you deal with a lot of annoying ASU students, but we are all 24-26 years old in careers yet we were treated like we were 20 trying to sneak into a bar, which was empty so probably could've used the close to $150 we spent else where. Needless to say, neither myself nor anyone who visits me in the future will be returning here, or attempting seeing as though it's obviously difficult to get in, despite being 3-4 years older than the legal drinking age. You should either train your staff better or get rid of the people who drive away business, or both."}
{"text":"Amazing wings! They have a cool little pool table to play. My fiancé and I go there for lunch on occasion away from our kids to have a mini date and we have a beer and 10 piece wings and we have a blast! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Came to watch game. Been doubtful about Zipps. This is my 4th Zipps and impressed I would come back. My waitress was very attentive and seating was perfect. The tv's were super loud but had a nice time. Thanks"}
{"text":"Took way longer than expected !

Called in for an order and waited for 20 mins at the bar on a Monday. They ended up losing the ticket and made me wait another 20 mins..

Guess it was just one of those days. But they need to pull their socks up a little."}
{"text":"I love me some Zipp's. Great wings. Great burgers. HH good...nightly specials better. Go to a Zipp's near you."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue.  I'm always here since I live really close within walking distance.  First off this is a sports bar, but the food is pretty decent.  Not a fan of the rolls.  I usually am always chomping down on their wings (get the golden variety), and cookie skillets.  I've gotten other food here. But i'm mostly here for the bar food and beer.  Their service is also great.  Very professional servers and bar tenders.  My biggest gripe is their fried mozzarella, it's mozzarella in a spring roll...

Also it helps that they have pool tables and a shuffleboard.  Great outdoor seating too.  Just a great place to kick back with friends.  

Get their zipperatas too!  Ask for all their varieties, more then just the regular.  grateful dead is my favorite.

Also would be nice if they were able to get a couple local brews in on tap."}
{"text":"The food is no longer edible and overpriced. The staff is undeniably rude. After my last visit, I refuse to ever go back."}
{"text":"This review is only based on customer service. There food may be or may not be great I have no idea.  I walked in the staff member looked busy and said its open seating. Found a seat at a table and after sitting for 10-15  minutes with no one checking on me to give a menu take a drink etc. I walked out still hungry and a bit frustrated."}
{"text":"I went to Zipps to watch the Red Wings lose in the second round of the NHL Playoffs this year...I was there after work one day with two co-workers and several other co-workers happen to come by since it is right down the street from where we all work. Our waitress was Lauren, not very good, she was slow, I kept having to wave down other girls to get stuff refills on my pints of Blue moon and shots. I got the Jalapeno Burger, was not to bad, was actually surprised at how good it was on the bad side, the bottom of the bun fell apart because it was quite soggy and these are heavy duty buns. Also got the chips and Salsa...nothing to write home about. The service here was not that great, and the server seemed like she had a bit of an attitude, my co-workers felt the same...and considering my check was $85 I would have expected better, when you are ordering multiple shots of patron silver and you ask your waitress for patron platinum to start you need to recognize the significance. We haven't been back here since and I probably wont go back here ever."}
{"text":"The golden wings are delicious! Also love the dos Equis with the margarita floater on top! Jamie is amazing at her job ! Always on point! Goes the extra mile and takes care of everyone even tables that aren't hers. I work in the industry and admire her work ethic. Always go to this location because of her!"}
{"text":"Ehhh....nothing special about the food here. The staff is very nice and sweet. The food is underwhelming to say the least."}
{"text":"Updated 1/8/18

My family and I went to Zipps last night for the college national championship game and some wings. It's been a while since I've been to Zipps and according to my first review the wings were great, however not this time. It was terrible! We ordered 5 baskets of wings and only ONE was a good batch. My husband bit into his first chicken and it was RAW. We flagged down our waitress and said this chicken is still raw and instead of her actually taking the time to look at the chicken she said \"oh no, the chicken is never raw\" and walked away. My husband and I looked and each other with confusion. Then my sister bit into hers and there was still blood in her chicken! I flagged down the host and asked for a manager and/or our waitress again. Once again our waitress came and said no it's cooked and called the manager over. The manager said it's not raw because their chicken comes pre-cooked, packaged and frozen. It's obvious according to the picture I took the chicken is still raw. Service was so slow, but understandable because the place was packed for the game, but don't tell me the chicken is cooked when its obvious that it's raw!"}
{"text":"Golden medium wings, enough said."}
{"text":"Can't top this place when it comes to their happy hour specials. The beers are HUGE and ice cold and the wings are straight fire and margaritas are frozen and tasty. It's the perfect place to watch a game and eat some good food for a great price."}
{"text":"Only 3 stars because the food is good. Service is TERRIBLE! had to go up to our waitress when we wanted ranch, had to go up to our waitress when we wanted the check, had to go up to our waitress for napkins. Came during lunch and the place was not busy at all so really I see no excuse for such bad service. Really disappointing because I live in California and whenever I come visit this is always the first place I want to come to. Need to remember how bad the service is next time."}
{"text":"Not thrilled with how long it took to get food, onion rings overcooked, burger was good, price was good, lots of tvs"}
{"text":"This is a fun and exciting place, to blow off some steam. The bartending service is great, the food is excellent, and is always a good group of people there"}
{"text":"Zipps is usually a great place to get Burger's and have fun. Server Carmella was horrible, she could not keep up with our requests. Leaving items out that we requested. She mixed up our tabs. never checked on us and when she did, she didn't stay around long enough for us to put in an order. Worst experience to date."}
{"text":"We have been here twice. The first time we sat at a six top and were asked to move since there were only three of us (this was a Tuesday at about two, no one sat there) My glass had lovely red lipstick all over the edge ( I don't wear red lipstick) the burger was cold and over cooked. We went again Friday and I decided to give them another chance. Server ignored us most of the time, hubby's pint glass of beer had orange juice pulp dried inside it, food was cold and unseasoned, condiments on the table were beyond gross. We will not be back for food. Maybe for drinks. Maybe we can bring in a pizza from the mellow mushroom to give them a clue. The need to clean. Learn how to serve, and learn how to cook and serve hot food."}
{"text":"I'm so sad to have to give 3 stars!  I've been coming here on and off since they opened. It seems to me the quality of the food has gone down hill lately. I got chicken tacos today and they had hardly any filling in them!  I swear it was all taco shell(stale and cold) and maybe a tablespoon of filling. I waited 10 minutes for server to bring my check and finally left money on table and left.  Get it together Zipps!!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips in Phoenix ! I love this place. The food is great and the servers are super friendly. The green chili burger is tops and I really enjoy the salads and wraps."}
{"text":"Hmmm... coming from the Bay Area, I perhaps expected more Bay Area-Bar-esque food. I was pleasantly surprised that this was more than that.

They were able to quickly accommodate all 8 of us at 7pm before the monsoon hit, our waitress Jody was very nice and was able to get our food and drinks to us quickly, always a plus when you have a 3 year old near melt down. 

Why only 3 stars? The place was dimly lit and seemed a bit stinky (I need to have a good visual image of where I am eating). Also, the food specials didn't start until 8. That would have been fine if with a group of friends, but with the kids, not so much.

The foccacia sandwiches were awesome, the onion rings were superb and they had a wide variety of beer, domestic and imported and some local brews as well."}
{"text":"Just went out to try Zips! The server had at least 3 Monsters, Red Bulls or some kind of Speed freak drink! Ordered our drinks took awhile,then ordered some food took forever and it wasn't busy. The waitress was back at our table 5 times before our food arrived and five more times while we were trying to eat! Happy hour 8 till close specials Monday night wings and Skewers ordered shrimp Skewers and by the way they are not on the special just the Chicken. Wings were awesome and the Shrimp. Fry's were greasy sticks. Also ordered chicken cheese and green chile spring rolls and had the manager stop by so I cut one open and asked where is the cheese and chile's? Went to some explanation about there process of making them, a dry chicken breast roll and sad Sauce. And when we were ready to leave  where did the waitress go? Probably opening another Monster! And No one has ever complained! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Love happy hour bartenders here but thank goodness I did not bring my computer in as sometimes I like to get caught up on a few things before I go home. Wi-Fi unable to connect as usual. Not sure why this bar won't invest and get their Wi-Fi fixed, always a problem at this location. And not that I'm the guy that needs wi-fi at the bar just nice to have sometimes"}
{"text":"Awful Nachos. I like Zipps and have been going for years. But when something is not up to standards something needs to be said. Horrible Nachos. Zipps wont layer cheese and all this basket contains is chips, lite cheese with toppings sitting on top but once you pull a few chips off with the toppings all you have left underneath is chips. Manager was nice and explained that's just how they're made there nothing he can do about it. All there other food is good so will save my nacho craving for a Mexican restaurant. But if you order the Nacho's buyer beware!!"}
{"text":"Our server Lisa is amazing but do not order the chicken nachos. All cheese and toppings on top and once you take a couple chips you have nothing underneath. Tim the manager was nice but there are no changes he can make. Not the Management's fault that these nachos lack what nachos are supposed to be because corporate will never change with this company because they think their menu is perfect.. With the higher prices that this bar now has they should make the extra attempt to serve layered nachos so that you have enough cheese all around to actually have nachos. Manager was polite when returned nachos and realized that's just how the nachos are made here,what a shame."}
{"text":"Zipps is a good restaurant for a quick lunch. The salads they offer are large portions and the iced tea comes in large tumblers. I enjoy this restaurant for wings, beer and a game. I agree that the bar could use at least one, if not two, larger sized T.V.s."}
{"text":"A Zipps is a Zipps anywhere you go, but that's a good thing! Whenever I visit a Zipps, I know that I will get good sports bar food, a great environment to watch a game, a nice patio to enjoy the pretty weather with friends and a very delicious foccacia sandwich and fries! What more can you ask for? 

Their foccacias are amazing. The bread is the perfect size and is soft to the bite. They have several different flavors but my favorite is the Monacco foccacia. The french fries are cooked perfectly and just crispy enough. I also enjoy their wings and most people love either their wings or their foccacias. 

One thing that stands out about this location verses the others is that they have a Zipp bus which will transport people to and from Zipps to Salt River Fields for events and games. This is free! It's a great service because you can enjoy good food and a couple drinks and then get a free ride to the event."}
{"text":"Surprisingly enough, I do like this Zipps better then the other one. I think it might be because it's off the beaten path, but it's a sports bar for the times you want to watch a game without running into the world. At least that's how it is for me. Go for the games, the beers, the Monaco and the wings."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past week, first time since they've moved, and had a 360 experience between the two. 1st time was a 5-star experience. Their wings get a 5 star for sure and our server, I believe (and hope I have correct) was Jordan, a super nice and bubbly young guy whom I also would like to give 5 stars. He was on top of things and we never had to wait for anything. So, since I had such a great experience over the weekend I decided to do a take out order, which I ordered over the phone. 1) It wasn't ready yet when I got there. 2) I went to the bar to pay for my order and the chick behind the counter acted like I wasn't even there. Served and got everyone else their drinks while I just waited and waited, only needing to pay. It was bad enough my order wasn't ready AND they had to redo parts of it because they screwed up but just because I'm not getting alcohol doesn't mean I should be ignored. If you hate your job, find something else. So...I gave 4 stars for my first experience and 2 stars for my 2nd experience ONLY because their wings are the better of the bars around."}
{"text":"Zipps is Zipps and nothing really changes from location to location. This isn't a bad thing either! This is a quintessential sports bar with plenty of tvs, great specials/happy hours and good fatty food. My favorite is the Monaco focaccia. While it's a good spot to watch a game, Zipps also does takeout and they do a great job with it. I'm happy they made their way to Mill!"}
{"text":"My friends and I come here all the time, but will not continue to do so. The so called \"rules\" are ridiculous. The bar is half empty and a friend wanted to use a chair with a back due to his bad back and the manager came over and told him the backed chairs are for the bar, even though no one was using them (at least eight were empty). His chair was not in the way of any walkway or caused any issue, but the manager insisted that the backed chairs were ONLY for the bar, NO EXCEPTIONS. Horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Zipps. Great Happy Hour, fun energy and awesome Zipparitas. I could get a full meal on Happy Hour prices. Not. Too. Shabby. Now? ....

Went in on a Tuesday evening. Got there at 6:50. Waited for 7 minutes to get seated in a 1/4 full restaurant. Took 5 more minutes for server to greet us. Said to the server, 
\"We arrived at 6:50, and here we are at 7:05, could you honor Happy Hour prices?\" 
\"Sorry, no we can't.\" 
\"Could you ask your manager?\" 
\"Sure. I guess.\" And off she went. 
Several minutes later she returned. \"Um. Yeah. I talked to my manager and he said no. I'm sorry.\" And off she went. We placed drink orders, and food orders. 

What in the ever loving hell happened to the burgers?! I remember them being awesome. I ordered the Black & Blue. It looked like Wimpy's burger of Popeye fame. Slathered with blue cheese came two very small pieces of beef on a bun. That was it. The salad had brown leaves in it.

The sum total of the Happy Hour pricing was $10. But the poor taste in my mouth from the experience was much greater. 

Sending this review and a letter to the office, and let's see what happens."}
{"text":"Incase anyone was wondering I emailed corporate after I left the Yelp review. I got a response that they would look into it and promise to email back quickly. No followup occurred. So I replied again. They just ignored it this time. I don't know how this place stays in business."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would. 

A group of 7 of us visited the Ray & McClintock location on Friday 4/8 for lunch for a colleagues birthday. We arrived just at noon, and our server greeted us after about 5 minutes of sitting down, and the experience continued to get worse from there. 

About 10 minutes after arriving, we finally received our drinks, and that was that. Our server (says Brooke W on our receipts) did not come back to take our order. I had to approach the manager on duty to get someone to take our order, since we only had a short time period of our lunch hour left. When there was no other servers around, he began to mentally take our order, until the bartender came over into the dining room with pen & paper, after over 20 minutes, during this time, a party that arrived after us, same waitress, was served and orders taken in less than ten minutes from their being seated. After the bartender put in our order, we had to ask the manager and bartender for refills on our beverages as we did not see our original waitress until she delivered our tabs, which we also had to ask for. 

We are now 40 minutes into our lunch hour, and now do not even have time to enjoy our meals because everything from that point was so rushed, including an order that was incorrect. I had to then walk up to the manager at the food line once again to ask for the corrected order to go and a box for my food. Once the server was finally bringing over our checks, I had asked for a refill on my water before she even collected the tabs to run our cards. After running all of our cards and finished cashing us out, she then asked if I would like a water to-go. 

It was the single most frustrating and worst experience we have ever had at any Zipps restaurant that we have had at this location that we have visited numerous times before today. We will definitely have to reconsider before we return to this location in the future."}
{"text":"Called ahead to ensure there wasn't a wait, we were told no wait.  Got there and ordered wings and some onion rings.  After 30 minutes the server came by wanted to know if we wanted another round of drinks.  I said I  wanted the wings and onions rings. After another 10 minutes (actual time) they arrived. The food was okay but not worth the wait.  The manager came over and tried to smooth things over.  The odd thing the table that came in after us was friends with the server and got their food before us."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with Zipps! Still one of my favorite burgers in town! Met my mom for lunch and love going here because they understand that lunch hour concept that people have and they get you served and out in less than an hour but they do it in way that you never feel rushed! I know I will be back as I've been going to Zipps for years!"}
{"text":"Met some co-workers here for a going away happy hour. We had about 15 people in our group. We waited over at the bar area till most everyone got there. We were seated but they didn't have enough chairs so we had to crowd in. The server never smiled all night and just seemed like she didn't want to be there. We ordered a round of drinks, a few ordered appetizers and then we all ordered entrées and she was very cold. Never had a problem with service at any other the other Zipps I've been to but this night it really stood out.

Food is always good but this service on this night made me only give it 2 stars as it was very off-putting."}
{"text":"Only 3 stars due to the fact that it's location is poor. 
Went in with the lady and friends and there was too many old folk. We must have dropped the average age to 41.
Camelback and Chandler are the Zipps to go to. And you can't beat the medium wings or fish taco wrap."}
{"text":"This is the place to get a Blue Moon and all the Wings! The service is great, and the food options are insanely inclusive of everyone. But if you want wings you best come here and sit down!"}
{"text":"Fish Sandwich good,  Burger single patty not bad. Onion rings. .. Worst in my life,  no joke,  it was like they were fried sat around and refried...Chewy."}
{"text":"Ordered fish and chips for lunch. Fish was over cooked, almost burnt and more crust than fish. Fries were greasy and cold but at least the onion rings were good. Had this combo here before and it was much better on my first visit."}
{"text":"I'm here with a friend.  Sitting at the bar ready to enjoy the Broncos vs  Panthers. 

Seriously experiencing the worst service ever. This is unusual for Zipps but surprising that a bartender - someone who should be gracious polite and engaging could be so dismissive and unpleasant. 

Brian"}
{"text":"Wish the bar staff could be friendly and helpful.  Complaining about other patrons not leaving a decent tip when the service is worth 5% at best. 

Learn customer service and social skills as a bartender and your career will be much more lucrative"}
{"text":"We loved Britney she was so fun as a server, mixed super yummy drink and cup was always full"}
{"text":"Just enjoyed the Zipp burger with choice of sides.  Everything was delicious!  Fries and onion rings were hot and not greasy.  Burger was hand formed and done perfectly.  Only $9.50.  What a deal!  Nice atmosphere.  Was there at lunch time."}
{"text":"GREAT FOR LUNCH!  I may give it 5 stars if they are consistent on future visits.  I went for a late lunch and got a great Bacon Cheeseburger.  It was awesome and it took me a total of 25 minutes to get in and out!  That's great service.  Loved the menu and I'm looking forward to going back for dinner and Happy Hour which looked like a real bargain.  I've seen some reviews regarding bad service, so maybe during busier hours they have issues.  It's usually the managers fault for not having enough staff."}
{"text":"My favorite Zipps location. Great location right off Mill Ave.  Lots of television screens.  Great patio for people watching the crazies off Mill Ave. And since I live within walking distance, well biking distance, it's my favorite location."}
{"text":"Came here because I heard the wings were awesome! THEY WERE! The sauce was perfect! Being from Buffalo I know my chicken wings too!
My wife and cousin got their main dishes and were disappointed in the quality. They both, barely ate half of their main course.

Alcohol and wings get two thumbs up from me.  Everything else... not so good. 
I will be back for those wings though! Thanks Zipps!"}
{"text":"Terrible. 49 minutes between visits from our server. Sweating like an African child when they shut off the a/c for an hour for no reason. Daddy is angry."}
{"text":"Party of three unsatisfied customers. Beer mugs were hot so the beer the was warm. Ordered wings and nachos for appetizer, both took around 1 hour to come. Nachos were cold and wings under cooked. Ordered turkey sandwich, chicken tacos and philly cheese steak. Sandwich resembled a sandwich a 3 year old would make and fries were soggy and cold. Chicken tacos resembled a clump of dog food in a tortilla, also cold. Cheese steak was... well.... I'll save my comments on this disaster, and onion rings under cooked and... you guessed it... cold!!! Place was half empty on St Patricks day.... so this experience was inexcusable. They gave us two $5 coupons for the inconvenience and those coupons were left behind because this place should be closed next time I'm in town!!!"}
{"text":"Bar food, I get it so I make concessions for that.  However, LOUSY SERVICE ALONG WITH CRAPPY BAR FOOD - no excuse for that!

Went here Friday 3/6/15.  Yes Friday night, right around happy hour so easy to figure out, the place will be busy.  You'd think the management would have that figured out by now so I cannot give anyone a break or accept the excuse, the kitchen is behind because we are busy - seriously?!?!?!?!?

Ordered appetizer chips, salsa and guacamole.  Chips are greasy and limp, not crispy.  Salsa was awful and the guacamole, tasted like a mashed up avocado with nothing in it.  Ingredients were tasteless, you could see them but you could not taste a thing.

One of us ordered a burger, the menu says cooked medium.  Burger comes out, take a bite (1 bite) it is rare so that means when you get to the middle it is going to be RAW!  Let our server know this after waiting over 20 minutes to get 3 meals.  Returned this to get a \"cooked\" burger.  We'll get back to this in a few paragraphs.

Chicken Foccacia, their signature dish and why I chose to come here in the first place.  Where the heck is the chicken?  I mean 3 little pieces of cubed chicken on my piece of over cooked, dried out focaccia???  And ordered onion rings which could not be eaten they were so bad and mushy.

Next, fish tacos and yes I wrote \"tacos\" which are served in a folded up burrito tortilla.  Not a fish taco by most restaurant standards.  The fish was tasteless as were whatever else was rolled up inside the tortilla.  

So over 20 minutes later, 2 of us are done with our meals, at least what we could stand to actually consume.  Then, finally the cooked burger arrives!!!

Our guest eats as we sit and stare at him.  The check comes and the burger was charged - really, 40 minutes to get a burger and you charge us?  My guest called the waitress back who's attitude went from bad to worse as the time passed by.  He asked her kindly to remove the burger from the bill.  She did and returned with a new bill and commented\" the menu specifically states that the burgers are cooked medium\".  

First, say goodbye to your tip little smart mouth waitress.  The issue with the burger was that it wasn't cooked correctly to begin with, hence it was returned so my guest would not get sick from consuming under cooked hamburger meat.

My other guest summoned the waitress back over and explained to her that the reason he asked that the burger be removed was not due to it being undercooked rather the fact that it took over 40 minutes to get the meal and the re-fired burger back out to the table.  So she was SCHOOLED!!!  My advice, it you are a waitress in a sports bar serving bar food and you have to write in on the menu that burgers are cooked to a certain doneness, if you want to have happy customers and not have this sort of problem, be sure to tell customers that \"medium\" is really under cooked and raw.

I've seen many unhappy customers comment on the customer service at this location, which is non-existent.  Looks like Zipps could use some new management or possibly, the ownership just doesn't care.  Either way, we will NEVER come back here again or any Zipps for that matter.  Too many other quality sports bars in town to put up with servers with an attitude and crappy cooks."}
{"text":"Worst food and worst service ever :( I will never come here again. Wings were saucy and cold fries and onion rings were greasy and gross the service and management was terrible! They were not willing to accommodate in any way:( NEVER EAT IN THIS PLACE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few of the valley Zipps and this one is probably my favorite. Went there last night with a handful of friends. The service was great. Our server was really attentive and had a good sense of humor. And when she was too busy to drop off our drinks, another server was coming by with them. Top notch.

And I had the pleasure of destroying a basket of chicken skewers! Dang those are so good! They're different than most chicken strips/fingers in that they're not overly battered. For a strip of fried chicken, they're surprisingly light.

Decor is pretty nice, brick walls all around. Partition between bar area and sit-down area. And it's nice that there's a good mix of people. This location is a bit of a drive from my house but I will definitely stop in again when in the area."}
{"text":"I love zipps! All zipps! I love bar food in general, but I really love zipps! The zipperitas are my favorite (strawberry), but I also love when they have the 32oz beers on special! My favorite item to eat here at the skewers with medium gold! Mmmmm sooooo good! The servers are always sweet friendly girls and I've loved them all! My boyfriend and I come to this location the most and we are always happy:) even though it's a chain, it's a chain I love love love! I get the food and drinks I love and there's always a game on that my boyfriend wants to see! Yay! Win:)!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks are ok there. Nothing too fancy or anything like that. Good place to go for lunch or happy hour."}
{"text":"My wife and I have going to this restaurant on Thursday night for past three months to have a beer and a slice.  A couple weeks ago I went there for the usual but there was an NFL game and a World series game on and the restaurant was busy.  I put my name in and waited for my wife and the table.  30 minutes went by and wife had not shown up and the table had just become available.  Hostess said I can't seat you unless your other party shows up first.  I called my wife, she cancelled.  Hostess would not seat me as a single...TERRIBLE..Hostess did not tell me this when I first put my name in.  WON'T BE GOING TO ANY OF THE ZIPPS EVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Great food, people and location, the managers, Scott specifically always go out of their way to get NASCAR on at least one TV. Not many sports bars go out of their way to keep customers happy, like Zipps.

Update: Still decent but could be better, doesn't seem like they want to make the atmosphere better. It's a pain to get a specific game on outside and to get volume is a real pain in the arse. Love the location but they could really make it better.

Dysfunctional! Hard to get games outside, service isn't very good, the 40 st location is way better, our group is taking our business elsewhere, a shame to because the location is great. They need to get better management."}
{"text":"My family and I had never visited a Zipps before this store open in our neighborhood , and it has become a regular stop for us ever since. I am not a sports fan, so I barely notice the tv's, but they have many and they lend to the high energy of the place. The staff are enthusiastic and attentive and this restaurant is clearly well run. 

Overall this restaurant is very comfortable and inviting and the food is good. Not usually a fan of home made fries, but theirs are generally well prepared. Nice selection of burgers , salads and sandwiches has something to please everyone. Beer selection is great as well. Ultimately, we always leave full and satisfied. 

A great addition to Ahwatukee, by the crowd that I usually see there, business is good and they should have a great future ahead of them."}
{"text":"Avoid this place - that's all you have to read.

The seating is very awkward for large(r) parties, the food is VERY overpriced for what you get (ex. ordered a appetizer of Cheese Sticks, got 5 with the order, but was $9 for them...) and the waitress we got (her name was Rainy) was very slow and VERY rude. She brings a co-workers check back and states \"you usually tip your waitress, there isn't enough in there.\" He had a tip waiting to go when she got back, just wasn't in the amount to cover the bill, so she gave him the money back and waited for a tip. 

If you got this far, let me reiterate, DON'T GO HERE."}
{"text":"All of these Zipp's restaurants are very loud inside, even when there aren't many customers. This location has a big screen TV right over a walking path, (by the ATM) which I saw numerous customers bump their heads on the bottom of the TV. Bad location.

Tonight, the restaurant was freezing cold. We asked to eat outside on the patio (where it was quiet and warm) but they said there was a private party there that reserved it.

I ordered two appetizers, the 12-chicken skewers with a side of the mild wing sauce to dip them in, and the mozzarella sticks (which arrive in spring rolls, exactly as described on the menu.).

They serve Coke products (Yay!)

I also ordered the fish and chips. The fries are amazing! The fish, not so much. It tasted fresh, but was cut way too thin and was very dry as a result. Its made with cod, but the cod is just 1/4\" thick. What a shame. If that cod was 3/4\"-1\" thick (or thicker) it would have been amazing.

Everything tasted fresh - as if nothing is frozen and everything is made on-site. That's a good thing, but our waitress never offered me a refill on my drink, allowing it to run dry during my meal. The fish was too dry and the chicken was flavorless. Again, everything was very fresh, but flavorless.

Maybe I'll go back and try the pizza, maybe I won't go back at all unless they start offering  ear plugs and a jacket on the menu."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 15 years.

Pro's
- good food all around.  Haven't had anything that wasn't good.
- portions good
- price good
- like the shuffleboard
- lots of TV's
- staff good (do miss some of the old timers)

Con's
- not enough seating for larger groups (go to Goldies for that)

Perfect place.....  Will be back..."}
{"text":"Not great.  Our waitress was perfect.  Friendly and helpful. The wings were big and fat, Plenty of meat.  That's as good as it gets.  I ordered the fish tacos.   I expected fish tacos.  I received a fish burrito, cut in half(2 pieces).  They even attempted to convince me that it was fish tacos.  I am not an idiot.  I got a burrito.  I am still a little upset.  It wasn't very good, but that could have been a mixture of disappointment and anger.  I will stick with CK's in the future."}
{"text":"Happy hour every weekend!  First at 11am-4pm.  Then later at 8pm-close!  This place is a great place to watch sports.  They have a LOT of TV's to watch 1 or multiple football, basketball, baseball, hockey, soccer games, etc!

My only recommendation is to call ahead of time to make sure they have tables available.  This place fills up fast!"}
{"text":"Typicall bar food.  The golden wing sauce is really good."}
{"text":"This used to be a great little bar and I am not sure what happened to it. My daughter has gone in 2 or 3 times now and she consistently gets bad service and she suspects it is because she is a teenager (17). They have over charged her, double charged her debit card, and just given her poor service. So I decided to go with her the other night to get a bite to eat and waitress #1 shows up, takes our drink order, then waitress #2 shows up with our drinks and says she is now our waitress. She brought our Onion Rings/Fries out cold and I had to send them back. She took forever in swinging by the table to check on us. They brought out the MOAB brownie without any spoons. It just went on and on. I never used to get service like that there and I did not recognize any of the managers that used to be there. They won't be getting any of my money in the future."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since it has been open and I can't remember a good experience, but it has been a year-ish so I figured I'd give it another shot.  Plus i just wanted a Chicken quesadilla, nothing fancy.  The food is lousy and it's slow.  Every time I think they can't mess it up, they manage to. I sent my quesadilla back because it was missing the chicken (I received 2 separate meals) and it came back cold and haphazardly thrown together as one and didn't appear to even be reheated.  C'mon you couldn't splurge for another tortilla and some cheese? Even the waitress seemed embarrassed!  The other locations I have been to seem fine, this one is terrible! They do have shuffle board and a huge patios though so it gives them their one star.  There are too many other options now out here to waste your time and money at this place."}
{"text":"I went in with some co workers for happy hour. There were 9 of us in total. They sat us at a table that was entirely too small; we were all literally shoulder to shoulder and still hanging off the ends of the table. We never had the same server twice so that led to many miscommunications. Waited 20 minutes for a beer and even longer for chicken tenders and fries. The part that's really disturbing is that the bathroom looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years. The toilets had mold coming down the inside of the bowl and those really gross rings that come from calcium deposits. And it just went downhill from there. 

Makes me wonder how much they clean the kitchen there."}
{"text":"Good drinks. Great food. Great crowd. Amazing bar tenders. Favorites are the montzerella sticks, burgers and foccatia. Lots of tvs. Juke box. Pool tables."}
{"text":"Great sports bar and lunch spot.  TV's everywhere and a fun atmosphere.  When you go, their focaccia wraps are unbelievable. I like the Monaco and the buffalo chicken.  They have a ton of draft beers and an interesting drink menu."}
{"text":"WORST BAR/GRILL FOOD EVER....AVOID

We were visiting Gilbert from California and actually were looking for OverEasy but it was closed so we went over to Zipps Sports Grill next door. BAD MISTAKE..... WOW, probably the worst lunch that I have ever had in my life. My wife and I order their onion rings and share their chicken sandwich and we didn't even take more then two bites. The food was all greasy and badly served. 

The 4 and 5 stars on them probably are from folks that enjoyed the beer and not the food....WORST BAR/GRILL FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD....

They need to look into getting some new line cooks and change their cooking oil daily."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to come hang out, drink some beers and watch a game, then Zipps is the place. I come here for the wings. Get them golden hot with sauce on the side. I personally think the wings tastes better when it's  naked and you can pick whatever sauce you like to dip it in. The zipperitas are pretty good & they're kinda strong. I think you can only have 2 or 3 max. 
I've tried some of the other food like the burgers, fish and chips and some appetizers and the food is okay but nothing that's amazing."}
{"text":"Looks I'm not going to lie, this place is great for what it is. The pizza is better than the 101 location. You just have to be really careful what you order. I truly do love zips wings especially with the super hot sauce on the side. The beer specials on happy hour and the zipperitas are pretty legit. The Turkey burger also seems to be pretty good, friends of my swear by it as the best Turkey burger, also suspected they cook it on the same top as the regular burger (not a bad thing in their eyes)  as it disguised it as a regular burger."}
{"text":"Excellent service in the bar with Tony.  Love the Steins of beer. Love sitting at the bar. They are great remembering who you are."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food and service. I prefer this Zipps location over a couple others I've visited."}
{"text":"I work until 6 every day and unfortunately miss out on happy hours all over the valley because of this. Needless to say, I was pretty happy when my coworkers informed me that Zipps happy hour went until 7, woo! That earns a star from me for sure haha.
We went on a Friday night and it was not very crowded which was nice. I hadn't been here since high school and forgot how inexpensive this place is! I left satisfied and only paid 14 total for my veggie burger, fries, and margarita! 
The service was incredible too, all of the servers were really nice to us and did excellent. I asked what flavors the zippartitas came in and I was surprised by all of the options they had, there were a ton! I just went with strawberry and it was ok! Was only $4.50 so I can't complain. Was pretty strong and looked pretty so that's a plus. For my meal I got a mushroom Swiss veggie burger. I'm not a huge fan of store bought patties like the one they used, but it was pretty good! The fries weren't great but I still ate them. Well I will be back here now that I've discovered the happy hour!"}
{"text":"While not a very frequent visitor of Zipps, when I do go I so really enjoy the buffalo focaccia and fries, that's what I always order. I understand when food orders sometimes do not meet ones expectancy so hopefully there is a manager or person that can right the ship. 
Tonight the fries were way over cooked and when I bought that to someone's attention they were very quick to offer to bring me a new order of fries. I finished my sandwich and my wife finished her meal but still no fries. Matt the manager came over to apologize and told me that I was not the only one to comment about the fries, when they remade the fries they were also over cooked. I said thank you but we both finished our meals at least five minutes ago. I said rather than new fries why not just credit me the $7.95 for my sandwich and be done. His comment was the fries are part of the meal and can't be credited separately.  I understood him and said just credit the $7.95 and be done. As he was telling me he can't do that the new fries arrived and both my wife and I said that these were undercooked. Matt came by to see if all was good and I told him not really these are undercooked, he apologized again and offered to bring something else but since we had finished almost ten minutes ago it became silly at this point. All he had to do was credit the one meal or give me chit for a free sandwich on my next visit and I would not be posting this. If Zipps makes someone a manager they should have the authority to solve issues like this or if he does have that authority he certainly is not qualified to inter act with customers"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and decided on having the battered fish sandwich with french fries.  My sandwich came out and it had three layers of crispy fish!! Whoa!! The fries... Yuck.  Soggy and flavorless.   I removed two layers of fish and thoroughly enjoyed the sandwich.  I recommend trying the fish sandwich it's good! If you don't have a big appetite, I suggest you tell the waitress you don't need a triple layer of fish.  This goes for all sandwiches and burgers.  Apparently, Zipps gives you double or triple layers of meat on the burgers and sandwiches unless you request otherwise."}
{"text":"HUGE beers, lots of big TV's, yummy apps, what more could you want in a sports bar?!  The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because their beers on tap are lacking.  I've never had bad service and I really do appreciate how clean and new everything looks in there."}
{"text":"An overall score of three stars sums this place up perfectly.  It's not horrible, but it's not great either.

I met a buddy here for drinks on a Friday night, the bar area was packed but the rest of the place was pretty mellow.  My bud was sitting inside but wanted to move outside when I arrived.  Unfortunately, it took about 15 minutes to close out his tab with the indoor server which didn't excite me about the outside service.  Luckily our outside server was awesome, so funny and attentive, she was the best part about Zipps.  I had a buffalo chicken salad to eat which is one of my faves but Zipps version was the worst I'd ever had - iceberg lettuce tossed in watered down ranch with some buffalo chicken chopped up - no tomatoes or any of the other fixin's you'd expect to find in a salad.  The patio was nice, even if it is in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Zipps out near Talking Stick never does me wrong. 

Service is key since this is a sports bar and I value the flexibility of the staff to please everyone in the restaurant with respect to which game they want to watch and on which television. In addition to quality wait staff, one thing I particularly like is that I can see the management out on the floor, which means they are very in tune with the pace of business. I see them often bringing out orders. 

I typically have the Jalapeno Burger off of the specialty burger menu which is a delicious juicy double stack with fresh Jalapenos on top. I also typically schedule a longer run next morning. 

If I'm in the area, I always aim for this Zipps and will continue to recommend it for all those in the Talking Stick area!"}
{"text":"Went here with a big (actually huge) group of little leaguers and parents. The staff handled the chaos with politeness and great professionalism! I come from Vegas where there's not many places that have that hometown feel to it. This place has that! I loved it!  The menu was full of many different options. We tried the two types of wings to see which was better but they were both amazing!  We also tried one of the burgers which my fiancée really enjoyed. The big beers were just that...BIG!  They also had great happy hour specials. Their prices were very affordable. We ordered two baskets of wings, a burger with fries, a slice of pizza, two 32oz beers and it was like $30. Very cool!!  Definitely will return! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I had been to Zipps twice before last night, but only for appetizers and wings - which are solid.  However, three people in our party ordered the pepper jack \"focaccia\".  When it came to the table, I was pretty certain it was the wrong meal.  Reason being, the \"focaccia\" bread came out looking nothing like any focaccia any of us had ever seen.  That wouldn't have been a problem if it had tasted even remotely edible.  It was undercooked, almost raw & transparent in some places - and unpaletable.  

I'm leaving three stars because the beverages (tough to screw up) and the wings were fantastic.  The service was less than stellar as when I mentioned the undercooked bread to the waitress she looked at me like I was an alien.  So, no more trips to Zipps!"}
{"text":"Clean and comfortable.   Plenty of TVS top watch your favorite team.   Turkey burger was really good but sweet potato chips need some seasoning."}
{"text":"I wanted to give one star but be did have some positives. First of all, the service was good and the beer was cold. It was very dark and loud inside so we decided to eat on the patio. They have ample amounts of TV's going with sports but they seemed a little loud and overbearing. The food is typical bar food but worse. We ordered the chicken rolls, chili, club focaccia and kids burger. The ideas are there but the execution isn't! In fact the menu descriptions make the food sound amazing and homemade. The chicken rolls were dripping in oil, the chili was greasy and I have no words for the sandwich. It was basically a thick piece of bread that did not resemble focaccia in any way, lacking in ingredients and tasteless. Onion rings and fries were typical, nothing special. Go for a beer but not for food!"}
{"text":"They know how to keep the place running top notch. EVERY worker there knew what to do, how to do it and do it right.  

BIG compliments to the staff. 

The food was good, we had salad, wings and veggies. It was simple and good."}
{"text":"I was here as the driver for THE COOL BUS AZ (Facebook it) for a bachleors party. The guy played pool on the 2 tables while I watched TV on the many they have. I was hoping to grab a game on the shuffle board but it was filled up and never let up,

The server was excellent, She handled the drunkl guys and the regulars with ease. 

The drinks were priced right. $2,00 pints although my Sprite was $2.50 or so...LOL Beer was cheaper then then soda. 

They have a great patio and a good looking menu."}
{"text":"I wish I was lying when I say I sat for 20 minutes without service on the patio here. I have served for years and I just can't wrap my head around why this seems to be a normal thing when looking at reviews from other Yelpers.

Let me note that I love Zipps and their Zipperitas...the wings are so good and typically I'm super fond of the service. Their other locations are great but this one was a joke. We got up and left and not a single person said a thing. Awesome!"}
{"text":"The best menu item is the Brownie Skillet! OMG, it's the best brownie in Phoenix!  Overall Zipps is average but they make up for their mediocrity with the dessert menu"}
{"text":"Worst zipps location. Waitress was nice however ran a 45 minute ticket time for wings in a 1/4 full house. Evident by our experience, the wait time for the neighboring table, and recent reviews the management at this location can't run the house."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, service. Great staff that remembers your name and is awesome at delivering tasty wings with quick service even during a full house."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic Saturday afternoon at Zipps. The manager Shannon was very attentive and the margaritas were delicious. Ask for the house margaritas with grand Marnier -on the rocks. Best neighborhood bar experience!"}
{"text":"HORRID. I work in a restaurant so I am very understanding when it comes to eating out. This is the first time in my life where I have not tipped. Came in on a Thursday night with 6 people. We were seated and then left for literally 25 min. I had to walk up to a bartender to get them to send someone over to take our order. Our orders were taken and our food took a substantial amount of time. Obviously there were a lot of us, so this was expected. Our food came out cold. I got a 1000 Island burger with fries and onion rings. The bottom half of my bun was so soggy it fell apart the second I picked it up. I asked for another bun and they replaced it. Everyone's fries were cold, not lukewarm, completely cold. No one came over to check how we were doing or to re-fill drinks. They were not understaffed either. A lot of servers were just standing around talking about our table specifically. We could tell because they were pointing and glaring. Finally when our server came over to ask if we were ready for our checks, my friend said she didn't want to pay for her fries because they were cold. The server went and ranted to her manager right in front of us, pointing and making annoyed facial expressions towards our table. They took off $1.50 for her fries. I was charged for a soda I did not order and she said she would take it off when she took my card. I was still charged for the soda when she returned with my receipt. The server had to go back and fix the total she charged me. She was not apologetic and not once did a manager come over to speak to our table. Never going back. Do not waste your time or money. I could've gone to In-N-Out and gotten a better and cheaper burger and would've saved myself an hour and a half of torture. This was the most unprofessional establishment I have ever been to. I wouldn't be surprised if it closed down in a few months."}
{"text":"Zipps was a great time! It was my first time there and we had amazing service. I think her name was Jessica, but she made sure we were always okay and checked up on us. I will recommend this bar to all my friends who come to mill ave"}
{"text":"The wings are freakin hot!!!  I enjoy my wings with some kick but man I must inform you; if you can't handle the heat stay away from the wings!  I had to gargle some warm water to get my taste buds back.  Haaaa! More water please and extra ice!  The burgers is a must -- nice cheesy and the beef was just right and moist.  Our bartender was down right chill and made you feel at home.  Ambience is your typical sports bar scene.  Shorts, T-Shirts, and Flip Flops are welcomed. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My experience here was good.

My server was very friendly and the item she recommended was very tasty - the Chicken Foccacia, which was on par with the chicken wrap at Four Peaks.

Sports bar atmosphere with nice big TVs. I see no reason to rate this place less than a four."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Zipps of them all. It's not the \"standard\" style like the new ones tend to be. The staff is very friendly. Fun place to watch a game or grab dinner. Always good food and drink specials."}
{"text":"First time back in the joint in a long time. Shared some chicken skewers with my wife and sons as an appetizer and then well ordered our burgers. 

I ordered the 1000 Burger which was amazing. Chicken skewers were hot and crispy. Our server, Sydni was on top of our orders because everything came our fresh and hot. Our drinks were refilled without hesitation and our table was clean and she was very personable! 

We will be coming back again now that we have moved close."}
{"text":"We go to Zipps about once per week, usually with our kids, or neighbors, or after little league games.  Service is excellent, prices are great, and quality is great as well.  
It gets a little crowded during spring training, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I give Zipps this rating based on convenience, price and atmosphere.  Food is okay but its a fun spot with a lot of televisions.  My kids can act like animals and nobody will really blink because its kind of loud.  The prices are great and there are multiple daily specials.  Highly recommend as long as you have the right expectations!"}
{"text":"Poor service, bad management, ridiculous treatment of guests.  It's a miracle this place is still open.  Watch out for roaches."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar and it's a chain. Nothing I can really add except that this one is brand new, which is nice. This is my Plan B place when all other bars close shop for the night. They have drink specials all the time and service is decent, especially if you're a man (not being sexist here, I'm just saying that the servers here seem to be a little more attentive to us guys....I wonder why?) I would never ring up the crew and say \"Hey let's go to Zipps\" unless it's 12:45am on a Tuesday-by then I'm usually already three sheets. It's more likely I'm at another bar at last call and someone asks \"Where should we go?\"  Reply: \"I know, Zipps!!!\" Drunken shuffleboard to follow."}
{"text":"Food very average! Manager, when she wasn't eating, was awful. Seems like it's gone downhill over the years."}
{"text":"All you need to know is \"pepper jack focaccia\" and \"medium golden wings.\"  I just to be a strictly \"monaco\" guy until they made some additions to the menu.  Their wings are the best in town and I could drink the sweet jalepeno sauce.  The service is not great but their daily drink specials and food make up for it...after all it's a sports grill not a fine steakhouse."}
{"text":"Typically love Zipps, tonight sucked. Fiancée said she wanted some wings, perfect...I wanted to watch hoops and hockey. Zipps it is. We show up and it's understandably busy, no problem. We get seated and that was about it. Sat there for at least 10 minutes without anyone even looking at us, let alone asking if we wanted drinks. After watching another couple get sat and get drinks ordered across the way, we decided to get up and go somewhere else. 

Not sure if the hostess didn't bother to tell a server she sat us or what, but at least 3 waitresses walked within our vicinity and no one bothered to stop by. It's not like no one noticed we walked in and were sat, I'm 6 feet 5 inches tall and was wearing a bright yellow hat.

We left and let the hostess know no one came by. Super disappointing as I was really excited for that black and blue burger. Oh well, maybe next time."}
{"text":"Meh. Nothing special. Typical overcrowded sports bar near a campus. The hostess was rude, took forever to get a drink, super loud & if you sit outside there's a 99% chance you're going to get sprayed by their sprinklers no matter where you sit. Plenty of other great bars on mill to check out. I'd go here again if it was a last resort and all other bars were closed."}
{"text":"I had the fish and chips for lunch the other day and it was pretty bad.  Part of the breaded fish was over cooked and a lot of the oil found its way into the skimpy pieces of fish.  I wasn't impressed at all but at least my server was friendly."}
{"text":"Good ambience, bar area is laid out well. Service was good.  Table/family area the TV's can be located across the room from you so you may not even be able to see anything depending upon where you are seated. Overall everything was average for a sports bar, but the food was below average. We had a good size group and tried many things but left with the impression that everything didn't have flavor or was just plain greasy.

Would go back if invited by friends to but wouldn't choose this place on my own there is better around."}
{"text":"Great patios, great sports bar, great beer, great service, NOT so great food. We love this place it is very convenient to where we live, but we only come for the happy hour beers (which are huge) and to sit on the great patios. The food is just really bad..."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here on a semi regular basis because it's very predictable. Her and I know that if we come here, we'll get good food, drinks, service and leave with a smile on our faces. 

 I must say, even on the rare occasion that something is subpar, there's always a fix... no business is infallible. 

 That's why I give this place a 3 star, it's good, but at times if it's too good for too long things start slipping. 

 Yesterday (12/16/16) my wife and I came her to unwind after work, it was about 4:30pm and there was a few tables of people and one large party. The large party was being taken care of by a different waitress. After we sat down, we ordered drinks and waited; while we were waiting we noticed that the center of the table was sticky, not the outside of the table, just the direct center. The waitress came over with our drinks within a great time period and we politely asked if the table could be wiped because of the stickiness. The waitress advised us that the new organic chemical they use tends to make the tables sticky. I let her know that it was just the center of the table. After it was wiped, we felt and it was still sticky. I let the waitress know that it was the table itself that was becoming so worn that it had become sticky in the center. This was no big deal at all, but after the waitress left the table, she never came back. My wife and I sat there for about 17 minutes and watched the waitress walk around the dinning area without looking over at us once, I even tried to waive the waitress down, but alas... nothing. My wife and I didn't finish our drinks and walked to the front, I let the hostess know that we had half full drinks at the table, but we don't want them and we refuse to pay for them due to the amount of time we spent waiting. 

 My wife and I went to Teakwoods which had almost ever table filled; we were sat at a booth, the waiter came within 1 minute, we ordered our drinks and received them within 6 minutes, ordered food and the food came out within 14 minutes... all in all we waited 30 minutes at Zipps just to walkout and leave because no one paid attention to us. Within 21 minutes of Teakwoods we had our drinks and food..."}
{"text":"So tonight we had the wings.  Always good but tonight the wings were so small and dry and over cooked, we couldn't believe it. They were the smallest that we have had there in a long time. If the wings continue to be that small we're going to have to go elsewhere.  I bet if you were to weigh them they would be 33% less. Honestly they should be sold by the pound rather than 10 to an order. Nice way to make more money for Zipps. Talked to a women manager and she gave us some lame excuse about cooking time. And most of all she didn't care a shit about us. But most of all she was disrespectful of her customers."}
{"text":"Lauren took care of us.  She was a fantastic server.  Friendly quick fun.  Food was great. Beer was cold.  Had a Ziparita and that was really good too.  Had a great time at Zipps. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"What happened Zips?  You were once the Gold Standard for wings. Your Golden wings were nice sized and always had just the right cook to give the skin that perfect crunch. Now your wings are soft and the skin chewy rather than crunchy. We ordered 50 wings (5 orders not cheap) for as our contribution to the Super Bowl party. Im not even sure they are worth bringing. Maybe if I throw them in my oven I can crisp them up a little and just hope they don't dry out. Tell me this isn't what the once proud Zips Wings have become... 

3 Stars because at least the wing sauce is good."}
{"text":"I feel bad for all the others that have been here and not gotten good service as everytime I have come for happy hour the service has been really good. I usually end up with the same waitress and the sad part is I still don't know her name. The zipparitas with chambord as well as the one mixed with a strawberry daiquiri are really good, the beers are huge, the nachos are yummy  as well are the fries and they are very cheap for happy hour. All in all not a bad place to visit. I do hope that service gets betters for others though. :("}
{"text":"I'm truly convinced they don't know how to make wings at this location. Maybe I'm the fool for continuously ordering them. But a simple request of crispy wings and \"easy\" on the sauce. Not 1/2 crispy wings and no sauce. Then I end up having to sauce myself. If that's the case, I could've made wings at home. So I'm not sure if they just don't know what crispy is and light sauce, or they don't care. Just my $0.02."}
{"text":"These are the best wings in the world! Sweet jalapeño burger is to die for, don't forget the delicious fries and onion rings. Service was awesome!!! This place is fantastic :)!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink, watch the game and enjoy dual Golden Tee machines! I've stopped by several times but have never reviewed because there wasn't much to say... I've never been super impressed with the food and rarely order it... but I ordered hot wings and they were actually really good! I wanted to order the extra hot but was voted down because 'I couldn't handle it'. Seriously!? Of course I can! So instead of listening to us go back and forth, our server stepped in and said I'll just bring you a side of the really hot sauce. Turned out that not only could I handle it, it was awesome!!! Sooo... Really, this review is about Kristi. Service here is typically random but she is always sweet and super helpful!!!"}
{"text":"so pissed off. the waitress tipped herself on my credit card when i wrote huge across it no tip!!!!! this fat blond girl will be fired for fraud.

my experience was horrible. not only did i have to wait over an hour for my sons slice of pizza but i had to wait 45 min each and every time we needed a refill. you couldnt find the waitress. i watched my food sit in the window for over 30 min no other orders up there. she charged me for ranch for the wings when it should come with that right???? she charged me for extra wing sauce because my wings were cold and had no sauce, but that was my original order...wings with wing sauce. how are you going to come back and charge me for shit that should come with the item on the menu, it says sauce flavor you get a choice of sauce. such bullshit i will never go back."}
{"text":"I have been to Zipps all over the valley and the bartender Sara has made this experience the best one yet.. Keep her she rocks at what she does!!"}
{"text":"I liked my waitress. She was great and deserves a star. Aside from that, not awesome. They changed the tv I was watching and didn't bother to talk to me about it. I had to ask to have another TV changed. I changed my seat to make it work, and I was sitting at one table and ONLY one other table was filled (two people who came in after me) in the entire non-bar area. While changing my seat the employee who changed the tvs watched me from the bar area with a dirty look. Not sure what his issue was. The appetizers were okay. Ordered pizza by the slice (worst pizza) for my kids and a BLT which was not correct (added mayo when no mayo was requested). How do you get a BLT wrong? Well, they figured it out. A pile of burnt bacon and broken up slices of bread. After seeing it's quality, I decided to not have them make it right. Them getting the order wrong was a good thing since I did not have to pay for what looked like a bad BLT. I have been to another Zipps. The issue with this one is clearly management. Bad to adequate food and poor management."}
{"text":"The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad. 1 time what we ordered and what we got were not even close.  Ok chalk it up to a mistake the next time chicken fingers that had so much grease it dripped off of it just holding it up."}
{"text":"Everything you'd expect from a Zipp's establishment. Food, service & libation are as good if not better than expected compared to other Zipp's locations. Staff is well trained, friendly & food arrives timely.  An abundance of HDTVs with the sports enthusiast in mind. The modern decor is appreciated by laid back Ahwatukee patrons.  That being said, parking is a challenge during happy hour. Accessibility to the shuffle board table and restrooms could be less crowded.  Overall, this location is an above average Zipp's establishment."}
{"text":"Went here around 7pm on a Friday night. It wasn't busy at all which was surprising. Sat down and got drinks served to us right away. However when we were ready to order, our waitress was no where in site. Must have taken a 10 minute break or something, and finally we ordered. Food came out pretty quickly and it was okay, nothing great. Then when we were ready for our check, our waitress was gone AGAIN. Finally another waitress noticed we were waiting around so she kindly got our check and rung us up. Overall would not go there again. Ever."}
{"text":"WOOOO hoooo! We love our Zipps...not only is it a great place for food, our fav waitress, Kayla is always there. Its worth waiting for her section. She takes such great care of us, knows all of our drinks and food and just starts making our drinks when we walk in. We don't even have to order. She's got us DOWN!!  Only bad part is it would be WAY more fun if she could just join us. We love this place....we've narrowed it down to our only happy hour place. Always great service and food, but Kayla makes it the BEST!"}
{"text":"Wow just had philly steak rolls. From menu description, beef is listed first. I guarantee you wouldn't know there was beef in these unless you had a meat allergy. Hot wings were good. No craft beer but it's not expected here"}
{"text":"This USE TO BE my favorite sports bar - but its gone down hill fast.  They need a NEW manager - and hire some better bartenders and kitchen staff!  First let me say, if you only have 2 bartenders and its crazy busy - you need more STAFF!  I sat there for 15 mins before I was acknowledged (and I was sitting at the bar). The male bartender seemed like he didnt even want to be there and the female bartender was busy checking her phone -and it was packed in there (NBA finals).  I had to flag them down just to get a menu. The little young girl who was seating people, opened up the doors - who does that when its 100 degrees outside, and people are smoking by the door???? GROSS!  Customers complained and another customer went and shut the door.  Okay, lets move on to the food .... I normally order wings, but lately they have been undercooked and limp - so when I asked for \"extra crispy\" they usually still come out limp - so I decided to order a salad - how hard is it to screw up a salad, right?  OH BROTHER  - the salad I ordered was the Chicken BBQ salad - the chicken was COLD, there was NO corn, probably 10 black beans, the cheese wasn't shredded - it was pulled apart in pieces - lol - and the dressing was so much it was like soup at the bottom of my bowl.  Our French Fires were nothing but grease dripping off of them, and they were soggy and not cooked.  I tried to get bartender's attention to no avail .... my beer was empty, my food was nasty, and when he finally came over to ask us about the food - I told him about the salad (literally he came over 25 mins later).  I just wanted out of there.  I like going to a place where the bartenders KNOW what they are doing and can check on you - not look and act like he doesnt want to make contact with you because he will actually have to do his job.  Get some quality bartenders, please!  Educate your staff, and get better kitchen staff - and FIRE that manager!!"}
{"text":"This spot was so good and so consistent for quite some time then about a year ago it seems something changed. Bar staff is still the friendliest in town but food is not good and good luck ordering food to go since they require you to be there in person."}
{"text":"Sub par. The service, the ambiance, the menu. The best part about Zipps is the - albeit limited - selection of draft beer! If you just need a casual hang-out spot for a happy hour, this place will do just fine."}
{"text":"The service is great. The food is good.  I come here every week for 1.5 years just to have magic hat on tap and they replaced it with less than appealing options. 

BRING BACK MAGIC HAT #9 !!!!!!!

Anyone else agree?"}
{"text":"My husband & I were so excited when Zipp's opened!!  Finally a sportsbar near our home!  It is huge inside, with an abundance of TV's.  Zipp's offers a great happy hour weekdays from 3-7, and then a reverse happy hour from 8-close. Also Saturday & Sunday specials.... 

If you are looking for a cold cold beer.....this is the place!!  Wings are awesome.....Salads are huge......Burgers great.....and their pizza is wonderful!!

On top of all that.....the staff is EXCEPTIONAL!! Everyone is so friendly and personable........ We have several favorite servers.....Kat......Elisa.....& Carly.......all the bomb!!  They take very good care of us.....Kat even brought us an anniversary card, after only knowing us for 2 weeks(who can say that?).........

Zipp's is our \"Cheers\" now.........

So to all those people who left bad reviews....I say bah humbug to you!!  We love this place!!"}
{"text":"Chicken wings are excellent. Lots of TV's with sports on very un-original. Would be more inpressive if they had a cartoon bar."}
{"text":"Slow service and the worst manager I've ever seen in a restaurant.  I witnessed the manager kick out 2 groups of people on Sunday (Aug 23, 2015) because they were making complaints about the service/food, and he threatened to call the cops if they didn't pay for the main dishes that they didn't even get to the table yet.  

The food quality was also poor, with extremely greasy overcooked wings, and lukewarm fries.  After reading the other reviews here, it's obvious that the parent company GMI Restaurants doesn't care at all about customers.  IF they did, they would have stepped in and put a mature manager in place.

Zipps will never have a penny of my business again, and I'll go out of my way to make sure that all my family and friends avoid Zipps."}
{"text":"Went here last night with my wife and had a great time,
excellent service, fun atmosphere and good food.
The beer was cold and fast - I will be back!"}
{"text":"Typical neighborhood dive bar. Beers are cold, and there are a ton of flatscreen TV's around to watch a game. Food is ok. There are only a couple of table games available and I wish there were more because the few times I've come to this bar the games are always being played by people. 

Really would only recommend coming here to watch a game. It's the type of atmosphere that's appropriate for doing something like that or attending with a group of friends for happy hour. Not much else to offer from Zipps at this particular location, but it gets the job done in terms of being a good bar."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pepper Jack Foccacia. We waited about 45 minutes to get our food at 2:00 today for lunch. Many tables were dirty with plates from previous customers. When the food arrived the fries and onion rings were cold.  With so many good choices in Scottsdale, we won't be going back. Very disappointing?."}
{"text":"We go here a lot and the new Managers a jerk. Found out that only the Manager can change channels and he made us ask 3 times to turn on what we wanted, 20 minutes despite no one watching that tv. Then puts our show on another tv, so we have to move around bar to watch. Then he puts on golf onto that tv 5 minutes later! Great customer service. Nice new Manager Zips! Keep taking care of your customers, believe me we noticed."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 stars.  My god, the server really ruined a fun night out for my group.  

A large group of friends and I decided to meet here to celebrate two birthdays and watch the ASU game.  By the time I arrived there were probably about 15 to 20 people.  I sat at a table and when the server arrived I asked for a beer and to start a tab with just my boyfriend and I.  IMMEDIATLY the server coughed up an attitude and said everyone was on one tab, sorry.  Since I had just arrived I didnt see a reason why I shoudnt be allowed to start my own tab, so she let me, but not without a couple snarky comments to our table.  My friends let me know that she had been rude from the very beginning, when there was only 4 people to start with.  

Anytime she came by the table (which wasnt all that frequently) a couple people were ready for another round.  People would start ordering and she would huff and puff and complain that things were getting just too darn complicated.  Perhaps she could remember things easier if she would have written our order down.  

Now let me just say that I can understand a servers frustration with big groups.  I work at a bar myself and things can get complicated.  Perhaps if she reads this review she'll learn that most people want seperate checks, and its just easier to assume that from the beginning to keep things clear.  Also someone commented that she was the only server on the patio.  SHAME ON THE MANAGEMENT for having one server serve a busy patio on a saturday night; not to mention the fight and ASU game were on to make it even busier.

Remember that SEPERATE tab I started with my card for my boyfriend and I?  Well it turns out she just decided to throw a bunch of our beers onto the other tab because she couldnt keep things straight.....again, writing things down would really have helped out.  

I don't know if the server was new or what, but she was disorganized and incredibly rude.  I couldnt believe how much attitude she was giving us...isn't a large tab a good thing?  I've never before had a server who literally rolled her eyes and walked away from patrons who were looking to spend money!!! UNBELIEVABLE.  WORST SERVICE EVER."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner and this has become one of the regular lunch/dinner choices for us, especially during football season.  It's a great place to come with friends or family to eat and watch a game or play shuffleboard or just sit at the bar and grab a quick dinner.
Golden hot wings are my favorite but they also have a great BLT on sourdough..."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with a group of friends to watch the ASU football game and this place leaves much to be desired.  The service was okay, not particularly fast or overly friendly, but it wasn't terrible.  The food however, was garbage.  I ordered the club with fries; I could make a better sandwich at my house and the fries were so overcooked that they were crunchy.  I was still hungry after the sandwich so I ordered chips with salsa and \"guac\".  The salsa was generic and clearly not made in house, and the guacamole was half of an avocado kinda mashed up.    They had a few decent beers on draft, but mostly the domestic garbage choices.  

If you must come here, I suggest skipping the food and sticking with a beer."}
{"text":"Got an hour lunch?  Skip this location...literally takes 45-50 mins to get your lunch.   God help you if you order wings.   Hopefully you get a better waitress too..."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for years recently I have noticed an increase in prices and a down turn in the food preparation. Last time there our order was wrong I normally don't say anything but when I did the way they fixed the issue was a shock. My son ordered a burger and it came out soggy and under cooked, my onion rings were cold, and the meat on a wrap I ordered was dry, and the wings we ordered were hot not medium as we always order. When I said something about his burger I asked them to make another, instead the cook must have put his half eaten burger in the microwave then put the half eaten burger on a new bun and placed it on our table and decided that was all that needed to be done. I understand food cost, I've been around the business for a long time myself,  but we spent $45 bucks with an ice tea and water, when something is wrong with the way something is cooked this is not the way to fix the problem. I wish I had taken a picture it was not appetizing 
to look at. I have to say our server did try, but told me this was all she could do and that I would need to take it up with management, by that time I had had enough. This is something that our sever should have been able to take care of having to put my guest through any more than what I had was enough. I might try this Zips again but if this happens again it will be my last."}
{"text":"Hands down the Manger was not professional and really handled issues terrible. Because of the manager, he will be the reason my family will never return to this place. I will stick to Native New Yorker or Buffalo Wild Wings.  

Table top of 9 Sunday afternoon, this place was nearly empty. We were seated and our waiter took our drink orders and food orders. Orders were served but one order was missing.

In addition, I order Nachos, which was horrible. A large amount of chips with a handful of cheese on top. Ate 3 bites and the cheese was gone. What did I have left chips! lol The mozzarella sticks was nasty, greasy egg roll outside with a un-melted mozzarella stick. Was not at all appetizing. Both were terrible. 

Our concern was brought to the Manager's attention.....  Before, he obtain all information of the issue he argued and said we have ONLY been waiting 10 minutes. He spoke too soon to realize that we the missing order was just placed in the system 10 minutes ago but, actually was placed 30 minutes ago the first time. Therefore, everyone in our party was done eating by the time the missing order came out. At that point, the manager down graded his employee. He said, \"he is new and I am writing him up for this\" the manager continued to say \"he should have told me about the issue and he will be written up. He should have asked for help if he didnt know what he was doing and he didnt notify me that he needed help\" 

Like rather than an asshole he should have not shared that information but implemented improvements at training staff efficiently. The manager was just being jerk. We explained he didnt have to punish the kid but just see if there is overall operational improvements that can be ment. He was so stuck on pushing his power and authority rather than seeking long term resolutions that would benefit the employee and the company.  
 
Little did he know that one of our party member is a Manager in the same business. Handed the kid a business card let him know if he needed a job to apply at her place of business."}
{"text":"Mushroom swiss burger was good....fries were good but I normally go for the onion rings...the onion rings this time were hard and cold...kind of like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for awhile....a long while...."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed Zipps, the atmosphere and food are good. However, I notice lately that when ordering take-out, the food is not as good. For instance, the other night we finally got around to deciding on dinner late in the evening. We ordered a kids burger, Cesar salad, and a chicken sandwich. The kids burger was horrible. It looked and tasted like a hockey puck. So that went uneaten. The salad was ok, but my chicken sandwich had like the flattest piece of chicken in it. It was so flat and small, I was thinking this must've been a joke. Well, we were hungry and it was late so we ate some of the food. But what a waste of money. I guess we won't be ordering from Zipps for a long time."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood bar/sports bar that could be made infinitely better with a more proactive management team. There are many times we go there and enjoy a great bar meal while watching sports. There have also been several occasions where something unsatisfactory has occurred - food not prepped correctly, to slow service -and no one from management has come out to address. 

Again - a solid line up of burgers and fries to wings to salads - good bar food at a spot that could be made great with some basic customer service tweaks."}
{"text":"Zips is one of my favorite resrants in phx prices are good and food is better!"}
{"text":"Man I love this place! They have great daily and nightly specials and they have happy hour! What more can you want? 

The focaccias are amazing! Try the pepper jack one!! 

Beers always cold and portions big. 

I can only wish they had trivia (buzztime)."}
{"text":"Buffalo wings, cheese quesadilla, pizza and onion rings were great. Beer was cold and this was a great place to watch some baseball."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! I love the frozen margaritas, Monaco focaccia and the fries! All so delicious!!"}
{"text":"Pros: 

1) Quick service

Cons: 

1) Waitress seemed like she hated her job.

2) The waitress couldn't recommend any thing to eat and said that all of the food was mediocre.

3) We were very disappointed when we got our food. The soup tasted old, the fries were overly greasy, and the hamburger meat was dry. The onion rings were crunchy. The \"focaccias\" are actually wraps. Buffalo chicken filling fell out of the \"focaccia\" as soon as I bit into it. 

Won't go back. If your in the area there is a plethora of better options 1 mile north in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"This is a solid Zipp's location (especially when compared to the location at Miller and Camelback). Clean place and friendly service. Rarely super busy and the patio is a good option, with a view of the parking lot and some foot traffic.

The food is typical bar fare, try to get here for happy hour or for a nightly special with something you like.

Come to this location for a cleaner, less busy Zipp's experience."}
{"text":"This is kind of the 'go-to' spot at work when I have lunch with the guys. Went there for lunch yesterday and decided to try something other than the turkey club sandwich or BLT (which are my general faves on the menu) so I tried the Monaco Foccacia. 

Well, ok, so the meal was tasty enough, although, correct me if I'm wrong (yeah, it's happened once or twice) but my Monaco Foccacia was served in a flour tortilla. I'm not sure if the term focaccia has been altered to mean burrito, but it was not what I was expecting. However, I have no problem with tortillas so didn't make a fuss. 

The \"sandwich?\" was tasty (but I didn't like the sweet jalapeno dipping sauce that came along with it...ick!) and I had the 1/2 and 1/2 fry/onion rings along with it. I was doing well until I bit into a particularly greasy fry and that pretty much ended it for me. I'm not a fry snob, in fact, it's a rare occasion when I have the urge for a fried potato sliver, but once I get a mouthful of grease, it's game over. Up until that point, I enjoyed the meal and I'm sure we'll be back, but next time I know that if I order a sandwich, I may need to remind them that I mean a sandwich on bread...

My friend order the fried chicken salad and said he really enjoyed it.

In the past I have had their wings and they are REALLLLLLLY yummy."}
{"text":"Tried this place out when Buffalo Wild Wings was slammed. There little to no wait here and the atmosphere was great. Plenty of TV's to watch the game. The noise level was a little louder then I would have liked, but that is to be expected with these types of places. Food was pretty good. I was not a fan of the \"Golden\" wings. I don't mind sweet, but these had an overwhelming mustard flavor to them. The regular hot wings were great though. If you try anything, do yourself a favor and try the mozzarella sticks. You may think to yourself, \"But Chris, I have had them just about everywhere and they all taste the same.\" Let me tell you, they are not the same. Here is how good they were....we ate two baskets and ordered two more immediately. They are wrapped in a wanton wrapper. It gets you the flavor of a cheese stick but the texture of a spring roll.  Even if you just stop by for that, it is worth it."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night with my family and had great service. A great place to take our twin toddlers because it's not a super quiet environment. Some of the best burgers around! The wings are awesome too."}
{"text":"We try to patronize restaurants close to home so we decided to try Zipps Sports Grill.  The server was unfriendly immediately.  We ordered burgers and half fries/half onion rings.  A sea of beige food was not very attractive when served but it was the flavor we were really after.  The first thing I tasted was the onion rings.  They were only slightly warm and very doughy and chewy.  I could still taste the flour in the batter they were coated in.  The fries were also only slightly warm.  We asked for fresh fries and onion rings from another server since ours didn't come back to check on us but, unfortunately, the \"fresh\" fries and onion rings were only slightly warmer than the original.  The burgers were good although very skimpy with the lettuce.  And one of the burgers we ordered said it came with cheese and 4 strips of bacon but only showed up with 2 strips of bacon and cheese.  The manager tried to make it better by taking one item off the bill but a good manager should know that it's not the money we wanted, it was good food.  Overall, it was a very poor experience and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came here around 1130 pm with friends and our 2 yr old after a basketball game, the place wasn't too crowded yet and we were seated right away even as a big group of 9. The food was delicious, several friends got burgers and they looked big with a great heap of fries, they said they loved them. My husband got the wings and said he would eat more but he was stuffed, he liked how saucey they were and meaty, he's a wings guy so I'll take his word for it. I got the bbq ranch salad, it was a large serving, much bigger than most salads at other places and very good, I plan on going back soon to try it again. Our server was a really nice guy, very helpful, refilled drinks often and talked with us about our night etc. We had a great night all together, even our daughter was happy and content with her food, no complaints from us as I know it was on the later side and they didn't mind our 2 yr old..."}
{"text":"Zipps is a pretty decent place. The wings are good (I would recommend Golden style which are slightly sweet with your desired level of spiciness).  The rest of the food is so-so. It is usually a good place to watch a game, but always get there early or a seat will be hard to find. They do have great drink specials. The service is typically prompt but a little hit or miss."}
{"text":"Been coming to this location for yearsssss and it's the same awesome service and atmosphere !"}
{"text":"This place was really a neat location.  My friend and I played pool and had a drink. The server was great and the place was nice.  I really liked it and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"We really love zipps and have been going back for years, just don't know how often we will be going now due to the menu and price changes. We were all about the evening special after 8 on Sunday, but that completely changed. And I must say it was way over priced for the $6 pretzels. But unfortunately we went in and didn't know about these price and menu changes. So we were really not that excited anymore once we found out the Sunday specials changed completely. Our bill was a lot more than usual, but oh well. My fiancé was a little displeased about these changes since we always go to zipps for the specials. The service was good though and that is always important too."}
{"text":"Our family went here for the first time due to some gift certificates we received.  My son ordered the BBQ Bacon burger and onion rings and loved it! My husband ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger with fries.  Fries were a soggy and not seasoned well.  Burger comes plain with no mayo or lettuce or anything.  Although the burger itself was juicy, lack of condiments made it really dry.  I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger.  The burger was juicy but had the same problem with it being dry due to lack of mayo or anything.  It did come with lettuce, onion, and pickle.  The fries were a big disappointment.  

I scored this place so low due to the fact we ordered ranch dressing on the side and we were not told they charged 50 cents per small container of it.  When we got our bill and noticed the charge of $1.50 we questioned it and that's when we were told about the 50 cent charge.  Really? come on! Who charges for a side of ranch? The waitress didn't seem to care about the complaint just that they charge due to the fact it was made from scratch and the prices they charge for burgers doesn't offset condiment charges blah, blah, blah.  By the time you add fries, which are charged separately, and the burger, I could get the same meal price anywhere without the added ranch charge! Anyways, the manager took two of the side of ranches off begrudgingly I might add.  All I got to say is if you are going to charge for a condiment that normally comes free at other places, you should tell the customer.  It definitely wasn't worth 50 cents for the size! I feel like restaurants like this that nickel and dime you and charge separately for everything are not giving you a meal that has value. 

I still have $10.00 left on a certificate that unfortunately will go to waste as we won't be back due to this undisclosed nickel and dime charge and attitude we received when we asked about it.  This establishment needs to train personnel better on telling people about the ranch charges!"}
{"text":"It wasn't all that great....food didn't taste like it had flavor and maybe it's because it was late but my friends chicken taco didn't even taste like chicken. Like I don't even wanna give it a 1 star"}
{"text":"Save your money, go elsewhere.Terrible service, terrible manager with terrible ethics. I watched as a guest was shown to his table and he ordered a drink and meal for him and his wife. The man gets halfway through his drink waiting for his food when the server comes up to him and starts yelling about the beverage. The man gets up to leave only to be met by the manager to get yelled at a second time to pay his full tab. No food had made it out to the guest but the manager was yelling at him to pay his full tab or he would call the police. The man walks past him and the manager chases him down and writes his license plate down and came back in the restaurant to call the police. The saddest part of all this... The man never got to finish his beer. Save your money, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times because the wings and ranch are delish! I have tried a few other things on the menu but nothing compares to my favorite cheat meal from zipps of wings,fries and a side salad with ranch! 

However after my last visit I will not be going back! The service was horrible-- from the moment we got there our waitress was very rude and we could all tell very unhappy we were a party of 8. I am not sure what happened to customer service but she had none! It took forever to get even a glass of water! She didn't smile once it was weird and awkward. She may have been having a bad day but thats none of my business. Her service was awful! 

I should have learned the last few times things had happened like my brother leaving his wallet there calling them asking them to hold it and when he got there it was no where to be found or the time we went for my aunts birthday and they forgot to inform us or show on the bill that gratuity was included and allowed us to tip 20% more on a 500$ bill. At the end of the day Zipps and shady. To be honest this place deserves no stars."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick lunch before work and I was in a little rush but they were quick and I had the chicken rolls and golden wings it was really filling and good wings definitely a good experience overall"}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour after work with my friend.  I had read reviews on here about the food and went with the honey balsamic salad with chicken.  OMG, it was AMAZING.  Their chicken is so flavorful and the honey balsamic dressing is delish!  My friend had one of their $3 Zipparitas and said it was really good, but strong.  The place was packed and noisy, and my one star off is because the table we were sitting at put our faces right next to the feet of people sitting on the level above us - kinda yucky.  But it was the only table available due to the wind storm outside.   

Despite the crowd, service was really good and the food came out pretty fast.  i was impressed.

I will absolutely return there to pick up lunch during the workday."}
{"text":"Love this place. .. been to a few of them around town. Only wish they allowed puppies on the patio. Would have got 5 starts if so. I planned on spending a lot of football season there. Beer is cheap. But cold!  Lots of tvs. Food is awesome! Love the pizza especially!"}
{"text":"The service was decent. Very sportsy and outgoing but the waitress wasn't too attentive to us. She actually barely checked in on us and we had to ask other servers for different things."}
{"text":"When it's lunchtime and close by the north Scottsdale and north Phoenix area this is an ideal location! Coming before noon is the way to go to beat the lunch crowd! The staff was very attentive and friendly. I ordered from the appetizer menu which is filling in case you were wondering.
My chicken nachos had a nice mix of mozzarella and cheddar cheese melted with chicken. My other appetizer were the mozzarella sticks. These mozzarella sticks were like no other like the typical fried breading. The breading was similar to a fried chimichanga. What was unique was the thin layer allowed for more cheese in the mozzarella sticks. It's always nice to come back to a staple of the local sports bar and restaurants!"}
{"text":"Located in the heart of downtown Tempe, this classic bar and grill spot is ideal for lunch! I think a way to tell apart a good bar and grill is how they prepare chicken tenders. So yes I had the chicken tenders meal with onion rings. Really impressed with how quickly the meal came out. Something about the breading that was very unique. The light batter on the chicken tenders flavors really came out! The onion rings were not full of bread crumbs and the onions itself did not have that slimy flavor. 
I really had no complaints and a recommendation to have a better selection of local brews. All in all a pleasant experience that will be making my way back soon!"}
{"text":"Waiting to be served...is unbelievable! Me and my husband and two kids were seated in a booth and we waited there for 30 minutes with no sign of our server. The table of 2 next to us had a waitress serving them pitcher after pitcher of beer. But my kids (4 & 8)sat there hungry and waiting patiently. After 30 min we just left. The food isnt even all that. Its mediocre. Happy to say i will never come back."}
{"text":"Wow, we usually love Zipps and almost always have a great experience; until last night.  My hubby was there w/a friend and ordered Ballast Point on tap.  What he wasn't told was the PRICE of a large draft of this beer: $15!!  He was flabbergasted 1. that it was so pricey, and 2. that the bartender didn't forewarn him about such a high cost.  This was aggravating to say the least and has put a sour taste in our mouths.  We wanted to make the owner aware of this and hopefully pass the word onto his staff to let people know what to expect ahead of ordering."}
{"text":"Great sports bar with drink specials every night of the week. Probably the best priced drink specials on Mill Ave any night of the week. Quick service even though the bar was packed!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service ever!. Our food never came. An hour after ordering we walked out. As we were getting up the waitress literally says, \"So should I just cancel your order?\"
There was no apology or attempt to redeem themselves. Every table was wondering where their food was and the staff was literally hiding from everyone. The food is decent be every time I go there the service is bad. This will be the last time I visit this establishment."}
{"text":"Great burgers and great atmosphere! I love being able to watch sports from any angle of the restaurant. I had the BBQ burger Delicious!! Just writing this review makes me want to go get a burger again. If you love watching sports come to this place. You will not be disappointed. Great menu and drinks. My server was awesome and the GM came by to check on our group. That is awesome customer service"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. It was a Tuesday afternoon right after the lunch rush. This is a prime location for Zipps. Mill Ave !!! They offer great burgers such as the Zipps Burger and Bacon Burger. Don't forgot their world famous Zipperitas. 

Today I went with the Zipp Chop salad. I loved it. I asked for no onion or tomato. Add croutons to make it even better.  For my actual meal I went with an appetizer. The Chicken Skewers. You had a choice of 2 sauces. This is a big dish so if you are with a group this is a good choice to share with everyone. I just used it as a meal. My BF had the pretzels which he wasn't too fond of. He also didn't like the cheese dip. But the shrimp  he loved. This dish has a cool presentation. It came out with the shrimp on ice. 

Because this Zipps is located by ASU. (Alumni here) I loved all of the ASU decor. Plus they have an awesome photo of Pat Tillman. There are plenty of TV's and this location has a lot of  open space to walk around and not be so close to other customers. Outdoor seating is also available. 

Thank you Zipps! I really enjoyed my meal today."}
{"text":"Just had TERRIBLE service here. I wanted to go to Zipp's for my birthday and got there at around 7:00pm. It was a Friday, so my friends and I knew we would have a bit of a wait. Waited 30 minutes to be seated which was fine and understandable. Then, we ended up waiting another 30 minutes with not a single person come by to ask us for our order. I ended up having to get up and ask the hostess for someone to come by our table. The shift manager came and just offhand apologized for the wait and only took our orders because I let him know we were ready (He initially only wanted to take our drinks which we hadn't received yet). He didn't write our order down which ended up being a problem later. We wait another 15 minutes for drinks to come by from another server/busboy (by this point we haven't actually met our server). THEN, our actual server comes by asking to confirm that we wanted fries with our foccacias (no introduction, no apologies for the poor service, etc. just a quick \"you wanted fries, right?\" and then leaving) Fast forward to when we finally get our food, and our server hands my two friends their food and looks confusedly at me and says, \"Wait, are we missing something?\" To be clear, all i have in front of me is my drink. None of us have silverware; my friends have their full meals in front of them; and I haven't gotten anything. There are only THREE people at this table. So I say, \"Yeah, I ordered the buffalo foccacia.\" And she says \"Okay, I'm going to check on that for you.\" We end up waiting 20 minutes with no one coming by to check on us, no notification that the order got lost until our server comes back and very shortly says \"That buffalo foccacia will be out\" and leaving. No offer of service recovery, a 'sorry', or any indication that anyone on this staff cared. So, we wait another 15 minutes before we decide we're just going to leave. My friends didn't eat their food because they were waiting for me to have my food since it was my birthday. Lo and behold, when we are leaving, our server finally comes by with my buffalo foccacia (I have waited more than hour at my table for this food) and says \"Ladies, you're going to have to pay for that!\". For what? The non-existent food I haven't been able to eat and the piss poor service that only seemed to care once its money was walking through the door? We tell her we want to talk to the manager. She then takes our food off the table and throws if out to go get her manager. She COMES BACK, GIVES US OUR TAB (like we were paying for that after she threw out our food lol), and THEN goes to get the manager. The shift manager who took our order comes after a while and the first thing he says is \"So, what's going on here, ladies? Did something go wrong? Do we not want to pay?\" and we're standing there dumbfounded. Hell yeah, \"something\" went wrong! In the end, after attempting to detail every single thing that went wrong with this visit, the shift manager decided to confront his employee (our server) literally right next to us. That is ridiculous and so unprofessional. I mean, seriously, are you TRYING to start a confrontation? In the end, all we got were free Diet Cokes and 10 bucks of \"Zipp Bucks\" i can only spend at that location - which we'll never be going back to. Thanks for nothing!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after finding the location on Google Maps. Our server/bartender Karen was very nice as were the other 2 staff members we talked to. Had the Golden Medium wings (ordered the Golden Hot but she told me they were made with Habenero seeds, Uh No) somehow they came out both crispy and juicy unlike most of my spots at other places lately. The Buffalo Chicken salad my friend got was very tasty as well.  She really enjoyed their Blue Cheese dressing that came with it also. In general a very unexpected and enjoyable unplanned stop."}
{"text":"Came for NCAA March Madness. Busy, sports bar food, good drinks. Exactly what you are looking for. Lots of TV which is great!"}
{"text":"So...I don't even know how to start.  Giving this 3 stars (vs lower) only cause I like the chain and the food was good.  My husband's beer got there first and something was off (I tried it and agreed) so we sent it back.  They then brought my daughters Gingerale, my sons Mr Pibb and my gin and tonic.  The Gingerale tasted like pure soda water and my gin and tonic tasted like soda water and gin. So we called over the waitress and asked for them to check.  They then brought my husbands other beer order and the manager came over and asked about the beer and my husband said it's flat (and it was, I tasted it too) and the manager said well I checked everything and it all checks out, but ww will take your other one off the bill, my husband being embarrassed said I'll drink this one, which he never did it was that awful.  So then they delivered my kids food and mine and we asked about my daughters and my drinks.  The waitress said she'd check, when she came back she said they didn't think anything was wrong... so I ordered a greyhound and my daughter said I'll stick with water.  And, my husband then asked where is my salad?  They came back with his salad and we ate our meal.  At the end of the meal I got my drink which at this point I just guzzled cause I had the hot chicken skewers...net/net one of worst experiences of service and drinks.  So sad, it's very difficult to disappoint me and I'm leaving out details and also the gaps of time in between each scenario, just sad."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst zipps in Arizona, time and time again. They have the absolute worst customer service from the management all the way down to the hosts. This is why they were barely half full when I went in this morning at 11 am on football Sunday. Needless to say I left without even getting seated this time because of pure incompetence on behalf of the staff. Happy to go elsewhere, this location has decent at best food where the other locations have been consistently good."}
{"text":"Tonight, my 3 boys and I met some friends at Zipps which is walking distance from our home.  Kristi Settles was our server and was not only all over it service wise but very pleasant to all the guests(12) at our table.  I've supported this Zipps since it opened as I like to support local businesses and see them thrive.  Kristi was full of personality and very on top of her service including attending to the kids.  I'd highly recommend Zipps and specifically Kristi as a server.  We'll be back because of her!"}
{"text":"We live very close to zipps and go here often, but this time I was very disappointed in the food. The cheese on the pizza was old, the batter on the onions where hard and way too thick, the meat tasted kinda like iron, and the bacon tasted funny. We talked to the manger and found out they just got new chefs so I understand why they might have these problems. Overall I don't think il one going here that often anymore."}
{"text":"SO I love Zipps other establishments the service and food usually is great. Now first of the food was good no complaints for the food it is the reason they \"earned\" 2 stars. Service on the other hand was dreadful now I went with my wife father and 9 month old son, I know this is a family sports bar enviroment so they must uinderstand with 4 people you shouldnt be sat at a 28\"x28\" table but we were it was ridiculously small we ordered wings first because well Zipps wings rule ordered them extra crispy waitress stated it could take a little longer than usual but hey that is why we ordered them when we sat down we ordered our dinner's about ten minutes later well low and behold we got our dinner before our wings I am sorry but to make the wings crispier does not take 30 minutes thats a joke and it was probably longer than that and waitress just stated well i told you it would be longer than usual i looked at her and just started eating. My wife and father ordered salads with their dinner's well the salads came in the same basket as the sandwiches and dressing had seaped into their bread and made the bread soggy and not as apetizing. All in all not a good experience not sure if we will be back.

they cram so many people in this small location it is just crazy it was like I was at a restaraunt mosh pit"}
{"text":"Saw on TV tonight that Zipps had 5 violations on health issues in the kitchen.  Beef and Turkey meat out of date.  onion bags on the floor and much more.  A few times my family would go to Zipps and at least one of us would get sick.  If the food was cooked in oil I would definitely get sick.  I wonder if they ever change their oil???  Anyway after seeing the issues with the health department and ZIPPS, we are done with ZIPPS!!!!    Time to close your doors!

{"text":"The wing are always amazing. Golden wings are the best! Our server Meghan was kind of an a hole. Didn't listen to a word we said never finished listening and kept turning around but we'd say more causing her to turn around. She never smiled. We are both servers and she made our date night crappy by being a witch. We come for the drinks,specials and wings! We have had better service at McDonald's."}
{"text":"I love zipps and I am a regular, normally I would have given a 4-5 star review but this one experience I had was just not what I am used to. Our waitress, Danielle, was slow and never checked in on us when we were eating. Normally this would not have been a big deal but my friend was having issues with his food not being prepared properly and we wanted to get it dealt with. The manager that has the issue brought to his attention was fantastic. Please zipps, you are fantastic you just have a couple issues to work out and you will be the best."}
{"text":"So, I'm writing this review I've been to this place about 50 times and this is my first review. The reason for my first review is because I slowly realized that they are being really stingy on the fries. If you look at the picture I posted, there is barely a handful of fries there. If I come to your place versus going to another place for a burger, like BK or McDs, I expect at least to get some type of bonus in the sense that I get a decent amount of fries. I'm not saying load it up, I'm saying give me more than 10 fries ( I know I'm exaggerating but that's okay right?!)

I also have to tell you, they need to step their game up on their onion rings. Their onion rings are very chewy and they just need to tweak or replace their batter.

Okay, now that being said and my whining over, they do have great turkey burgers. I also love their wings and I really have never had a bad meal here. It's just that they're getting stingy on what they give you. Like most places they make the occasional mistake, one time I had their chicken rolls and they were still frozen in the middle.

So stop being stingy, put new batter on the onion rings and you won't lose a customer. I know my post gives mixed messages but I don't want to say they don't have good food or a great waitstaff, it's just I could tell a little qualities missing."}
{"text":"Waitress must've had a bad day, there was no friendly greeting. It seemed like a hassle for her when asking us what we wanted to drink or eat and rolled her eyes when we asked for extra ranch dressing. The food was over salted the french fries tasted like old robbery fries that were left underneath the car seat. When we were done we sat with dirty plates for 20 min as we waiting for the check."}

{"text":"A fun Arizona chain we don't have in Cali. They have all the classic sports bar attributes: tv's, fun named drinks like Zipperitas ... and an overall fun atmosphere. The food is good, though apparently they are confused as to what a Focaccia is. Service is decent, but a bit harder to get ahold of someone when you're sitting outside. 

Stay Cheerful ;)"}
{"text":"One of my top 10 hot wing and sports bar joints in the valley. Been here day, afternoon, and night. TVs are always running good sports. They had soccer too during the EURO 2012 finals- so that gives them an extra boost.

Amazing wings, Spicy as he**, but so good. Great service. They don't cheap out on napkins, which is always important when you go through two napkins per juicy wing.

Food comes out pretty fast and fries are good. Don't have artificial taste. Prices are right on and you can come out with a full meal and some booze for about 20 bucks a person."}
{"text":"I like Zipp's! Their burgers are DELICIOUS. The Jalapeno Chicken Burger is a personal fav, and their Sweet Jalapeno Sauce is heavenly. I actually enjoyed the side salad I got - but then, I can drench Balsamic Vinegar dressing on anything and it'll probably taste good. Wings are yummy, too. Waitresses were all really friendly. Oh yeah, and I guess you can watch the game there, too. Sorry, forgot to mention that -- honestly not a big fan of watching sports, I'd rather play them, if anything, but yes, while I was in Scottsdale I started craving that Jalapeno Chicken Burger. YUM."}
{"text":"After a 7 month hiatus we decided to give Zipps another chance. Sorry to say it's gotten worse, after waiting an hour for a table for 8 our 14 year old hostess tried to cram 8 chairs around 1 small table. All of our food was served cold and as usual the beer was warm. The Zipps chain including Goldie's seems to go out of there way to disappoint the local residents and are clueless about customer service. It's obvious by the countless 1 star reviews all the owners care about is the cash haul they get every night from the $4.50 draft beers and terrible greasy cold food. Stay Away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Horrible !!!!!!!!!!
Zero Stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Warm Beer in Hot Mugs!!!!!!!!!
Cold Greasy Food!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Terrible Service !!!!!!!!!"}

{"text":"I get DOWN on their hot wings. And the happy hour?! Perfect. I wish there was a Zipps on every street corner. My favorite sports bar, even though I'm not a fan of sports bars. Go!"}
{"text":"Group of us decided to watch the Spurs-Heat game here. We walked in and the sign said seat yourself so that wasn't difficult. A pretty good crowd at a bar and sports grill. I seem to think there are more people when the hockey game is on because of my last visit. 

I ordered Zipp's wings, buffalo style-hot. The waitress even asked me if I was sure because they are hot. I should of tried the medium first, lol. It was spicy and hot, but it was that kind of spicy-hot that you just wanted to keep eating over and over because of how good it was. In conclusion, I was a big fan of their wings.

I wish I would've gotten the name of our waitress. She had a trainee with her, but both were great because I'm pretty big on having my drinks refilled with having to wait a whole life time and they were good at making sure my water was filled. 

Only downside was  happy hour on the weekends. I mean Mon-Fri their happy hour specials is something you can't go wrong on, but weekends I feel not much variety and the 11am-4pm then 8pm-close is ok., Overall, food was good, company was good, service was good. All good."}
{"text":"Love their hot sauce. A little habanero mixed in delish! Plenty of TVs with various sports games. Catch a drink. Great place to come after work. 

During lunch food to table takes a little long, go only if you have more than on hour lunch to spare.

Have some decent happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Hot wing sauce hot and suicide are hot. It will affect your bowel movements if you aren't use to it. Suicide is sour, lots of black char in the sauce, and spicy. Hot is hot and with good flavor. Prefer hot over suicide any day. I usually ask for a side of the sauce.
The side salad is a pretty good size.
The pizza is described as thin and crispy. It was thin, but no crispy. Was not pleased.
Service, a little slow and when you need someone they are no where to be found."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick burger for lunch.  Fries were cold and tough the burger bun was not toasted and came with a few pickles on the side nothing else.  Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game with friends and have a few beers. Its nice and clean with lots of tv's and seating. Everyone working here is very nice and welcoming. On to the food. The burger is ok, the wrap is ok, the philly cheese rolls were ok, but the wings were good. I could eat lots of these wings. Very crispy and delicious. Overall I like this place for the atmosphere and the wings and drinks. Im sure we will stop by again. If they got the UFC fights then I would come for that for sure."}
{"text":"This has become the \"go-to\" place for happy hour for my fiancee and myself.  As a buffalo wing addict, I tend to judge places by the quality of their wings-and Zipps has some of the best!  The happy hour prices are fine, and we take advantage of the 22 oz. draft every time.

The rest of the menu is solid--never been disappointed.  The service is fine and the wait staff quite friendly, especially the bartenders. 

It's big place with plenty of seating, far better than the Scottsdale location.  Gets pretty crowded on Friday nights and NFL Sundays, though.  

Special props to Justin, one of the managers.  He's been especially accommodating to our Drinking Liberally group which meets there monthly.  Great guy and very helpful!

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"They have beer and shuffleboard, but that's it. Don't even bother with their food, especially the chicken!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Focaccia sandwich.  They said it was \"different\".  Yes, it was different.  Nothing like focaccia bread.  More like a burrito or wrap.  Not good.  Sweet potato chips were bland.  Beer was cold.  Would try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"When you come to a sports bar, you come to watch sports game. Apparently only the manager can change the channel, and nobody else. The manger was in the kitchen cooking, so the server told us sorry we can't change the channel because he can't leave for 4 seconds to change it. That's a huge part of the sports bar experience is to watch the game, now I missed the game. I was completely baffled at the fact that the manager wouldn't even leave for 3 seconds to acknowledge us or care enough about the customers to help out. Literally would take two seconds. Absolutely brutal customer experience. The server was great though. It wasn't her fault and she felt bad. Manager needs to figure it out. It's a sports bar. Care enough about your customers and change the effing channel. Pathetic."}
{"text":"Great burger joint/bar

I went in a large group (10 people), and the seating/environment was comfortable, noise level was not too loud, a lot of TVs to watch the game. Servers were extremely nice and welcoming.

I had their Thousand Island Burger plus onion rings.The burger was large, juicy, and the thousand island sauce was on point. I really enjoyed their burgers but the onion rings were a bit too crunchy and overcooked for my taste. Overall the place was a great hangout/bar to eat god burgers/wings and enjoy the game!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Great customer service and great drink specials. Their green chicken jalapeño things are awesome!!"}
{"text":"To be honest everything was pretty good up until a certain point. We were all having a great time, finished dinner and were winding down and trying to occupy my 2 year old after a 7 hour car ride from California to Arizona. I took her over to a golf game in the corner near where we were sitting and eating so she can spin the ball and play golf when the manager 'Brett' rushed over and right as he saw me put that dollar in and decided to kick my 2 year old and I out of the corner area where the GAMES are and said 'Sir this area is for people over 21 only' then points to a black sign with dark gold writing that's literally covered by a table full of beer bottles that states as such. Later to find out that that place turns 21 and over after 10pm. A fact which was NEVER explained with ZERO SIGNAGE. It was only 10:30pm our food was already in boxes and it was pretty clear we weren't going to be there much longer. 

I wouldn't be pissed except that 'Brett' the manager did ZERO explaining other than to point to a barely visible sign, and proceeded to kick a father and his 2 year old little girl off a video game that would've lasted all of 1-2 mins. Yea I was pissed. Still am. I understand rules, however there are ways to enforce them without coming off like an asshole and making a kid cry. I wanted to fucking punch him. I'd give zero stars, but I HAD to add one just to get this review out. Enjoy your time there at Zipps, careful though they are NOT kid and family friendly.

Oh and I am calling the GM as well. They need to make it more obvious for people not from here since they're right next to a fucking airport. Maybe if a family comes in near the 10:00 cut of time you could warn them, or better yet make better more visible signs and hire less pricks. Yea that'd be a good start."}
{"text":"Gotta love Zipps golden medium wings.  The best in town!!!"}
{"text":"Can I give this place six stars? Seriously, I think this place is great. I always pretend to be healthy and get a salad as a side but then end up getting their chicado burger or wings. But honestly? Totally worth it. The staff is friendly, the ample amount of TVs is great, the food is tasty, and the atmosphere rocks. I should lie and say the opposite because I'm worried it will be too busy this football season but I can't! I just have to spread the word."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great sweet jalapeño burger. Several locations to choose from where you can watch any sports event."}
{"text":"Everytime we have come to Zipps our service has been very slow and unacceptable. Even if they aren't very busy it still takes forever to get a waitress to come by and take your order.  It took us over an hour to get a drink once and they refused to compensate us in any way even after talking to the manager about how unsatisfied we were with our service.  The only reason we come back is because there aren't many choices for sports bars on mill and we actually do enjoy their food."}
{"text":"Love Zipps! Zipparitas are delicious, especially the chambord one (limit 3). Chicken skewers & chips & salsa are yummy."}
{"text":"Left because ONE Ohio state fan threw a hissy fit and they turned the ASU game off when 3 tables protested.  The manager did nothing! Shame on you this is arizona!  Will not be back for any more ASU games,  and this is the close pac 12 bar for me,  I will find another place!"}
{"text":"*FIRST OFF JUST DONT INSULT YOUSELF OR YOUR DINNER PARTY BY GOING HERE* Ive got to say the only reason to even give this place 1 star is because the manager Anthony knew how to fix his employees screw ups. So we get here at like 11:30 last night and i ask for a cup of coffee. This server straight said no. That she would not brew a pot of coffee for just one person. Ok fine... Can i have hot tea... Again i was denied... So fine i just won't have anything to drink with my meal. My boyfriend ordered an ice tea and it was cloudy and stale. It was far too old to be offering to a customer. Ok that was strikes1-3. Then we order or food. 20 minutes later when it finally shows up EVERYTHING was cold because this \"server\" left it sitting under a heat lamp. Cheese on nachos was cold and hard and my fries were so stale that they were nit edible. So we sent our food back along with three other tables around us. So... My boyfriends food comes back out and i wait another 5 minutes for my food. Now mind you the other 3 tables had already gotten their food. So as i sit and wait i ask to speak with the manager. Anthony come out and he is mortified at the lack of customer service and respect. He comps our food for us which was very nice of him. BUT!!!  When i finally get my food its not right and i ask the server why there was no bacon on my sandwhich... She states the club sandwich does not come with bacon. Ok wait then why did the first one have bacon? She wouldnt bring me a menu so i pull it up online. Sure enough... Theres bacon on a club... So i speak with Anthony again and he is dumbfounded.so his server is useless and just didnt want to do her job and his kitchen staff doesnt know how to make a basic club sandwich and nachos??? This was the most pathetic experience ive had in a restraunt in a VERY LONG TIME. Poor Anthony asked us to give them another chance but why in the world would anyone ever lower their standards and return to a restraunt that is lacking in leadership and professionalism? Your better off buying a 6 pack and grabbing McDonalds at this point... If you want a real good experience go to the one on union hills. You wont be disappointed... They're managers and staff are all on the same page."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere but the food service was very very slow, took us an hour and 30 minutes to get food, and there was 3! And we were sitting at the bar which is normally faster service but not the case. So plan on having a couple extra drinks here waiting for your food!"}
{"text":"Service - excellent 
Atmosphere - good
Food - bad

Won't be back...even fries and onion rings were bad"}
{"text":"Zipps is a spot my friends and I frequent. We have been here many times, and have never been faced with such disappointing service as I had tonight. After a concert, my friends and I called to ask what time the kitchen was open until and got the answer 12 am. What the person who answered the call failed to mention is that you have to be 21+ to order food after 11 pm. #1 this has never been the case before #2 this \"rule\" is not listed anywhere #3 the waitress who was very rude while turning us away just lost business from us for who knows how long. The food is great but the service.. not so much."}
{"text":"I come here often but now I'm done! Every time I'm here service get worse. High turnover rate! Even management. What does that tell you?"}
{"text":"We sat down about 1040pm and the server informed us if anyone is under 21 by 11pm, you can't be in the restaurant. First I heard out of all zipps that I've been to. The server told us, if we ordered food before 11pm, then we can't get kicked out while eating our food. We placed our order before 11 and didn't get our food until almost 1115pm. Then the manger comes and tell us that we only have until 1130pm to eat and leave. This is ridiculous bc they are telling us one thing, then another. I don't see how we can enjoy our food in less than 15 min. Especially when we clarified things to begin with. Otherwise we would have walked out and brought our business to a better restaurant. Coming from a business perspective, the staffs should have been trained to explain the law. We could have ordered food to go. But we were mislead that we could order and eat there. Food should have been comped to make things right instead of having customers walk out angry. Great food, bad service! Don't bring your kids here!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to go watch football on Sunday's.

The food is really good and the service is a hit and miss but overall this place still deserves five stars."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying we only went here because they were ranked top 10 for their wings in Arizona, which weren't that good to start off with. We ordered the appetizer about 10 minutes before we ordered our meal and it took them about 30 minutes to get the appetizer out to us and then two seconds later food came out which is really disappointing because it would be nice to get the appetizer before you get your food. They could really work on their customer service. And don't fall for the \"Amazing wings\" its a lie!"}
{"text":"A lot of tvs to watch the games...

I like that every game day the waiters/waitress dress up with NFL jerseys...

The promotions they have for the whole week are good, even if you don't take advantage of them...

Tall beers rule there... 

Wings and skewers is a nice combination to have on thursdays..."}
{"text":"I was going to give this place four stars even though my wings were completely dry as if they've been sitting for a while and had hardly any sauce on them at all but, I'm giving it one star instead because of the way Carl acted on the phone when I called. Everything was fine and he offered to make me a new batch and I declined because I still ate them. \"Didn't want to drive back over there to get a new order\" I told him it was fine I just wanted to let someone know because it didn't seem like a mistake but more so they just gave me wings that were already made. He said he would talk to his staff and offered me $10.00 in Zipps bucks for my next visit. I told him I didn't want them and just wanted to let someone know about my experience. Right after I said that he didn't say I'm sorry or thanks for bringing it to my attention or even thank you he just hung up the phone. I don't know if he got upset because I declined the Zipps bucks but, I wasn't really all that upset until that phone call. Might not go back to this location again."}
{"text":"Went here for a work lunch with some coworkers last week and we had a good time with fast service and a friendly waitress.  We were quickly seated outside (which we requested) and our drink orders were taken right away.  After about a five minute wait for drinks our waitress returned and took our food order - you can tell she was aware of lunch time crunches for workers with her quick service! Our food came out within about 7-10 minutes and everything was as ordered.

I had the wings with a side of BBQ sauce for dipping and they were delicious - I couldn't even finish all of them. I wish that it was an option to have had them tossed in the BBQ sauce instead of paying extra for the side of sauce, but that's my only real offering for suggestion on changes.

Overall: A-
I'm very sure we'll be back for a team lunch in the future!"}
{"text":"I am a long-time patron of Zipps. I've been here a couple times a month for 8 years. So, right around 200 times. I'm a lifetime $10K+ contributor to Zipps. I used to just love it. The food was stellar... WAS. But now I'm hesitant to rate it at 3 stars. And I'm sadly nostalgic for the 4-star visits in the rear-view mirror.

Zipps has been in steady decline over the passed 2-3 years. Sometimes you continue to go to iffy places because they are part of your circle's social rhythm. That's me and my circle with Zipps. Then Zipps started letting me down with their food quality, letting me down consistently. So much so, that Zipps ought to be one of my pallbearers when I died so they can let me down one last time. 

It started with the Chicken Skewers years back. Those went from succulent tasty morsels to smaller rubbery lumps of disappointment. Then the burgers started to drift south. The pizza is awful, but it always has been. So the pizza is not a factor in my review. The challenge lately is eating something that doesn't make my, mostly iron-clad, stomach hurt. 

My advice: Stick with the wings. They have been the shining beacon of delicious consistency in both taste and texture. Can't go wrong with the Zipps wings. We get them extra crispy.

Wings and salad. Those things are mostly safe.

What about the service? It's been exceptional in the past. Over the last few years the signature aspect Zipps service has been tired, overworked servers. What are you gonna say? I just wish it was different.

Gonna stay clear for a while."}
{"text":"This place is just bad. I had the wings and hubby had the southwest chicken sandwich. I had his fries and they were awful and cold. My wings were dry and tasteless. Hubby said his sandwich was bad too. The server wasn't that great either. Our bill was a little over $20. Not worth it at all."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place....a friend of mine recommended it.  I wanted to grab a quick bite and watch the Lakers game....so I headed here.  The good news.....the Lakers game was on & the service was pretty good.....the bad news....the food was awful.

I ordered:

Slice of Cheese Pizza - $1.95
Nacos - $6.25
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K-vBVV_RZX-BeyqOBWjsDg?select=2xK8WXBCBc62Yn81yFgmvw

The first thing I went after was the Nachos....I knew it wasn't going to be good when I pulled the first Chip and the Cheese slipped off because it was already somewhat cold and coagulated....then I bit into it....yep, it was cold, blech!  I tried to eat it, but could only muster a few bites.  So, I went to the Pizza....

As most of my Yelp friends know, I love Pizza....so I couldn't wait to give it a try.  I took a bite and was thoroughly disappointed.  It was bland and had that dreaded \"cardboard\" texture to it....damn!  Strike 2!

I paid my bill and left disappointed.

Return Factor - 30%......I might come back to shoot some pool and have drinks with friends.  For the food....probably not."}
{"text":"Recently discovered that they offer FREE WiFi at this location.  The food and service is still the same as my last review, so I'm not going to bother rewriting all of that.  The Wings and 1000 Island Burger are still my two favorite menu items.

One thing I like about this place....when you sit at the bar, the bartenders ask what your name is and then they use it whenever they talk to you.  It makes you feel welcome and comfortable.

Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"This place is dead and the service is horrible! It took 30 mins to get our food! Food was good to make up for the poor service!"}
{"text":"Bar service is good, lots of televisions to watch and not too loud.  Good vibe."}
{"text":"Wings are awesome, great selection of beer on tap and tons of tvs to watch multiple games on!  Friendly staff and great sports bar atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this place on Sundays for football! The specials are pretty good and Zipparitas will have you buzzing (limit of 3 is completely understandable). The waitresses are always on fleek and the food is above average for bar food. My personal go to are the Golden Medium wings with an ice-cold Blue Moon. Definitely one of the better sports bars in the Ahwatukee area!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Awesome food and Suzie is the best. Tvs are perfect and people are great. Come see Suzie or Toni. Both great."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere fun local place with great specials. food needs a little love but this isn't the place I go for a gourmet meal."}
{"text":"So very sad... I returned here last night for some Cardinals action and dinner with the boy and my waitress totally botched my dreamy vegetarian sandwich concoction.  Tear."}
{"text":"Very loyal customer, live next door. Just asked the manager if we could actually listen to the game....NOPE. He said if he turned it then he might have to turn it back. We have 30 minutes of advertising to listen to while Oregon takes on Duke...
WTF... Mgr really bad attitude."}
{"text":"This place sucks! The servers are some of the rudest around. The drinks are over priced and the Food is terrible. Manager followed us out of the bar after we only left a 15% tip on a $250 check. Seriously followed us out. This place is a joke,much better places around."}
{"text":"Lesson learned....never try a brand new place within a week or two after they just opened.

They just open the Mill Ave location 2nd weekend in March.  They still needed to work out all the kinks.  We came here for lunch and it was almost a 2 hour lunch ordeal.  Our waitress was super nice but everything including our waitress were disorganized.  Once we ordered our food it took 30-40 minutes to get and a couple girls in our party had to wait a little longer, once we got our food it was good.  We ordered sandwiches, wings, salad everyone was pretty pleased with the food except the sweet potato fries  were over cooked, but no big deal.  

Check Please!  Lordy....that took another 30 minutes.  Our waitress was running back and forth between 3 registers to process our checks.  That was ridiculous!  I hope this place gets their stuff together because on Mill Ave. those worker bees who work in the area need to get in and out within in hour.  Zipps can accommodate large parties which was great, but plan on a 2 hour lunch.

I'll be back in May or June to try it again for lunch.  We will see if they have improved."}
{"text":"Worst customer service experience at Zipps last night. We had a party of six and all ordered at the same time. Our server forgot to put in one of the orders and didn't realize it until the food came out. Okay, mistakes happen but no apology. In the meantime a large group arrived nearby and got their order in. You would think that our server would tell the kitchen to make the order she forgot on the fly, but no. She actually used the group as an excuse for an even longer wait. So now, we have all finished and our friends order comes. Nothing awkward about five people watching him eat and feeling rushed!

You can guess what we were expecting, \"so sorry for the wait, the sandwich is on us\". $8.50. NOPE!

We had to inquire about getting it removed and we were actually told no. We then asked for the manager who also told us no! She wasn't even friendly about it. She said there was nothing she could do about it. Really, the General Manager Susie couldn't simply take off the sandwich or discount it?  We even asked if our server had told her that she forgot to put the order in of which she said \"no\"! Unacceptable! We simply took it out of our servers tip. 
 
I have noticed the recent huge increase in poor reviews at Zipps thanks to management. I wonder why?  I guess the General Manager doesn't care about taking money right out of a server's pocket. 

This Yelp Elite won't spend another cent at Zipps. 

San Tan across the parking lot is amazing! Be sure to see for yourself."}
{"text":"Super disappointed!  I love zipps and frequent the other locations quite often, gave it a shot on a saturday afternoon, sat at the bar, and literally waited 20 mins before i was even noticed. (Not exaggerating) ordered a zipparita with chambord, delicious,  always are, then asked for a menu and got a sigh like i was a bother to her by asking for a menu, (brunette with a hat) ordered the buffalo shrimp with blue cheese, and when it arrived, there was no buffalo sauce at all, (they are supposed to be tossed in it) or blue cheese as it comes with on the menu, at this point i flag down my server, and ask for buffalo sauce and once again i felt as though i was bothering her by asking her for items that i ordered and never received.  The bill comes, my margarita was charged full price.  They were on special saturday before 4.. and was charged for extra sauces.. and it was supposed to come with my order hence the name buffalo shrimp. How can you charge extra for something that is part of the order? Very disappointed.  A call to weights and measures will be made. We wont be back to this location."}
{"text":"I could not believe the terrible customer service I received tonight at this Zipps location. My wife and I frequent this restaurant because we enjoy the golden medium wings. Tonight, we ordered two baskets. The first one was delicious as usual. We dive in to the second basket only to find it hot instead of medium. Uh oh! No big deal right? I'll just have the waitress replace them with what I ordered. NOPE!  I told the waitress the issue and she was nice enough. She said she'd take care of it. A few minutes later I was brought a side of mild sauce and some ranch. I was told,\"don't worry, we won't charge you for that.\"  Really? I don't use ranch. And mixing the mild with the hot does not make medium. Not to mention the flavor is completely different. When I politely asked to have the wings replaced I was abruptly denied. It's \"against their policy\" to replace wings. How is that against policy? I order one thing and got another. It's against policy to fix your mistakes? I then proceeded to tell them if they won't replace them then take them back and remove the item from my bill. Denied again. They forced me to pay for an item I did not order which they wouldn't replace. RIDICULOUS!!!! I could not believe how poorly we were treated. This was by the store manager! Needless to say we will be finding a new spot to enjoy wings. 

PS This experience is also combined with the fact that zipps just raised their prices on everything on the menu. The wings are now 2 dollars more than they were. The quantity and quality remains the same.

Zipps is not what they used to be."}
{"text":"Wings were great!   We ordered medium buffalo and the blue cheese dressing was excellent!  I ordered a tenderloin focaccia; not great. No local beer available.  He has Chicken breast sandwich-both meh at best.  Ugh!  Very busy but I think one and done for us."}
{"text":"Zipps Medium Wings!  Thats it!  The wings are hands down the best in town.  They are meaty and deep fried to a nice crisp and their sauce is just amazing.  Others dare but none compare!  Service is pretty bad some days though. -1 star for lame service."}
{"text":"This place is lackluster at best. Service left much to be desired. I had to ask and flag people down. Food was- sports grill food right? Waited forever (I've half an hour) just to get the bill."}

{"text":"I have given this location 3 tries...all of which I received the worst service I could imagine. This last outing (and by last I mean that was my last visit..EVER) I ordered my regular item which was a buffalo facasia- signature item. It was undercooked when I told the manager he simply said \"well you ate some of it so I can't comp it\" shortly after leaving the restaurant I was forced to stop because I had to run to the restroom from getting sick from the undercooked chicken. Don't ever eat here you  will regret it. I know I did."}
{"text":"PRO
Great location, perfect for a pregame but don't eat the food.  Plenty of TV's. 

CON
It took an hour to get our food.  Yeah, it was game day and very busy but really? an hour?
The Tuna Melt was less than satisfactory, my 8 yr old could make a better sandwich.  

Worst part is the first manager we complained to didn't apologize he just took the plate and walked away.  

We had them take it off the bill.  

Never going back there are better options."}
{"text":"I love Zipps. The food is consistently good and a great value. I appreciate their \"from scratch\" philosophy. Great service is what prompted me to write a yelp tonight. Kendra was awesome. Super friendly and personable. I've been in for lunch a few times and the service has been slow, I mentioned it to Kendra and she promised me that if I came back for lunch it will be fine. I'll change it to 5 stars if my next lunch is in and out in an hour. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Been here several times.  Ordered a salad for the first time and it was very good.  Zipps is great to watch the game, catch up with friends or just go play some shuffleboard."}
{"text":"Today was our first trip to Zipps in Phoenix.  We used to go to the one in Scottsdale on a weekly basis, but they have been doing really bad on their health inspections.  

I ordered a beer and appetizer at 4:50.  By 5:52, we still haven't seen our server to order dinner.  I had to walk up to the bar to get another beer.  The server stopped by to take our order at 6:00.  It's 6:53 and she hasn't been back.  This will be our last trip to Zipps."}
{"text":"Let me start off with saying that I am not a bar food kind of person. In fact, I usually eat prior to going to a bar, since the food is always the same (wings, fries,pizza, etc.) On Sunday, My husband really wanted to stop to catch a few games at the new Tempe location. I ordered my usual margarita with their house tequila and was very good. I browsed through their menu and came across their burrito (which appeared to be a new item on the menu). It consisted of chicken, cilantro, corn, black beans all in a tortilla with guac/sour cream/salsa on the side. Boy was this good! Extremely tasty and the combination of all the ingredients was very well put together. Something I never would expect to have at a bar.  I loved the fact that I did not feel extremely full as the items in the burrito were actually not all that bad for you. You have to try it. Never been to ZIPPS or been a fan, but guess what, I am now. I will be returning soon!

On a side note, the bar stools were a bit uncomfortable. I hardly have this problem (as I my cushion helps prevent this). Next time, I won't be sitting on them for a long period of time as they are a bit uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I came here on the afternoon of my 21st birthday to watch football, grab a few ziparitas, and eat a few apps. Of the three of us, we each intended to order a pitcher of beer to share. We were also going to order food throughout. However, once our first pitcher, ziparita, and wings came out we never saw our server again. She was nowhere to be found... until we saw her watching the football game. By the time she came back it had been 20-30 minutes and we no longer had time for more food or drinks. I asked to speak to a manager then waited for another 15 minutes. The manager never came over. If you want to be disappointed on your birthday, then this is a good choice for you."}

{"text":"g's birthday is this week, and my parents offered to take him out for birthday lunch this past sunday. the venue was g's choice, and he picked zipps. i swear he did this just because i hate zipps.

so there the 6 of us are, in a crazy-busy zipps on sunday afternoon watching olympic hockey and chatting away. i was shocked at the quick and friendly service - such a change from the last few times i've been here. our appetizers (2 orders of wings) were ready quick and the mild ones weren't too spicy for mom. the medium ones were perfect for me. and i hear that the hot ones are hotter than hell so we didn't even bother trying to order those. 

my bro hated his focaccia sandwich-thing, deeming it dry and tasteless. mom and i had the bbq bacon burgers, which were huge, bbq-y and super yummy. my bro's gf had tacos and said they were good. the birthday boy had a bacon burger and loved it. dad had a burger too, but i don't remember what kind. he said it was good. as far as the menu goes i really think the burgers and wings are what they do best. i suggest avoiding all other items.

one odd thing - mom got 1/2 fries 1/2 onion rings as her side, dad got all onion rings. mom got waaaaay more onion rings than dad got. g and i both got caesar salads as our sides and g's was waaaaay bigger than mine. i get annoyed when portions aren't consistent - no one wants to be the guy that got the smaller side =( 

our server was super sweet, and even though the place was packed we got our drink refills quickly and food was ready fast. 

i'm being nice and upping the rating to 3, not because i love this place but because this particular experience was far better than the 20 or so i've had previously. and our server did give us a free cookie/ice cream platter to celebrate g hitting the big 3-0. that was nice of her =)"}
{"text":"What a shit hole..service was so so..not to great and not to bad..I had a 18\" worst pizza ever..should of known when the menu is from Italian food to wings to mexican food?..other then the $2.00 beers I wouldn't come here to eat..This is my 2nd time here and the burger was greasy the 1st time..3 strikes your out.."}
{"text":"Maybe most people go there to hang out with friends and have some beer while watching their favorite sports. That's all very nice because this place has a good atmosphere for that (hence the two stars). 

But the food is not so great. I had the Mushroom Swiss burger (medium rare) with onion rings. And it was the GREASIEST burger and onion rings I have ever tasted. You can see grease dropping from the burger. I felt kind of sick when I'm half way through so I had to stop. 

Basically, if you just want to grab a beer with your friends, then you are ok. But if you really want some quality food, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Let us start at the beginning.
My friend and I decided to go out and eat at a restaurant. So we decided to go to Zipps for the wings and have a couple drinks while we watch Basketball in the T.V. So once when we parked and entered at Zipps. Zipps always has hostess to greet the customers from the entrance and get them seated to a table. Which usually it's always like that but for this occasion, when we walked into the restaurant, we weren't greeted right away as we had to wait couple minutes till a hostess finally came to us and ask us that question. Afterwards, my friend and I choose to be seated on a booth since we knew we were going to be there for a short period of time in there to catch up with each other and also the booths are very comfortably to sit down. Typically there's always a waitress attended quickly to tell you who they are and what type of drink to get started. Unfortunately, we did not have a waitress come to us and offer us a drink of water and/or take a look at the menu. After 10 minutes or so has passed by, that is when a waitress finally comes to our table and gets us prepared. So we just ordered sodas for time being since my friend was debating to get either an appetizer or some wings. After a look through the menu we finally decided. I only ordered Golden Wings with hot sauce with it since I wanted to have it sweet but have that hotness to the wing to mix the flavors, and my buddy only ordered the Nachos. After we finally got everything placed, the music was actually on a good level to still be able to talk to my friend without shouting. But the place wasn't very busy, since we got there around 8 o'clock PM. Therefore, the ambiance was soothing to us since we were capable to talk and watch the game, but quite odd since Zipps is always having energetic customers as well as the employees but not on that night. After being seated approximately 20 minutes, we finally got our nachos and our wings. As the presentation goes, it looked appetizing since the wings had extra sauce on them and the nachos had extra chips with loads of veggies on top of it with some beef on it. They looked great and ready to enjoy the meal, but when I took the first bite out of my chicken, it felt rubbery as if it wasn't fully cooked thoroughly. So I let the first one slide as it may have only been a bad one, but reality was that the chicken wings looked too big to be an ordinary wing because the size differences compared to the other wings are different. Then I took a bite out of the other one and I completely through out of my mouth since I saw 'Blood' on the chicken and for me that's food-borne illness. So I decided to not eat or order anything else since I lost my appetite, but my friend enjoyed his nachos. I have no clue what happened to the Zipps pride on making the known 'Golden Wings'. Therefore, when I think of hot wings I expect the chicken to be crunchy with the soft meat crawling in your mouth and eating the whole wing just leaving the bones behind. Therefore, I give a 1 star out of *****stars in this location due to the fact the waitress saw my 'full plate' of wings that I left three of them open to show that their was blood on it and not the hot sauce. And she completely saw it but ignored to ask if everything was okay. And she went along to get rid of the food and get us our receipt, so we felt rushed; but mainly the chicken wasn't cooked long enough not on one but the whole set of wings so I would not buy 8$ of the small plate of Golden Wings in this location. Therefore, you guys should go to the one that's located in Tempe since the employees there are more upbeat and check up on you and make sure the food is great and the 'Wings' comes out 5 times as better than over here!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch time, ordered two beef taco salads and didn't receive any ranch or that much beef. Our salads were mostly lettuce. We asked our server if we could get more ranch and beef and she said of course. She comes back with a tiny ranch enough for one salad and more beef and said this is all my manager gave me. Offered if we wanted to more ranch and we said yes. Finally, the manager, Brian, approaches us saying that the salads were supposed to come with ranch already and argued with us about how we didn't receive any ranch. He gave is a lot of attitude, dropped the ranch off with not saying a word of apology. Never been so disrespected by a manager before! Although, our server, breanna, who is two weeks new apologized for the experience here and gave us fantastic service. It is safe to say we will never come back to this zipps locations again!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! From the chain and outside appearance we were expecting a generic sports bar with average food at best. We were very wrong! The happy hour was outstanding with prices that beat out many other restaurants in the area. The burgers sounded delicious but we stuck with the happy hour for cost.

4$ beers are hard to find in this city but Zipps had them with unique drafts like Alaskan Amber ale. We got the wings golden style and they were FANTASTIC. A little bit hot with a. Sweet aftertaste. Service was good considering how busy they were. We for sure will be visiting on a Sunday when bloody Mary's are on the menu!"}
{"text":"We had a really bad visit. :(
- The bar said they were out of Bloody Mary mix - meanwhile, we see a bartender pouring it
- They said they were out of sourdough, although several items on the menu state that they come with it. They replaced with a bun without asking. 
- The food took more than an hour to come out.
- one sandwich was forgotten. After mentioning it twice, 1/2 hour after everyone else got their food, a manager finally came out to ask if we'd gotten it (we hadn't). He never said I'm sorry - just said, \"I'll check.\"
- The food was gross.  Most meals were in edible. The nachos were terrible - had a pool of grease left at the bottom. 
- The drinks were so weak, we watched the bartender pour.  He did put one splash of alcohol - not even close to a shot pour.  We demanded new drinks.  
- After a comprehensive discussion about splitting the bill three ways before ordering, one bill was delivered.  The waitress proceeded to ask all the same questions as before, but had each of us review what we ate. 
- 4 of 6 in our group said its the worst meal we've had in a long time, if not ever. No apologies were ever given and definitely no offers of a comping a single item.. We will never ever eat at Zipps again. Yuk!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, good place for guys who like sports. Great staff."}
{"text":"TLDR version:   If you're verbally abused and harrassed by another customer the manager will probably deny it ever happened.

I have been going to Zipps for years, can't even count how many times I have provided them with my business and needless to say, I don't know if I can ever go back again after being mistreated by a verbally abusive customer and then have that same customer file a complaint to the manager just to misdirect the blame towards myself.  The general manager threatened to throw me out after the complaint (he said \"I don't know what you are doing but stop it\" haha what a joke, you can't even give me a reason for the complaint AND you're admitting you have no clue what's going on?)  the other customer kept using f--- bombs against me before and after the manager spoke to me.  

I was so distraught I lodged a complaint with their corporate office and after 2-3 days they stated that the \"staff\" (which I am assuming is the same incompetent manager) denied that any of this ever occurred to me.  I have never been so humiliated in my life and I will never be giving Zipps my money again.   If I had been thrown out of the restaurant I would have most certainly sued for discrimination, but since I did nothing wrong (the manager couldn't even quantify why I was being given a complaint) they couldn't do anything to me except favor the abusive customer and take my money.  Thanks but no thanks, never again Zipps."}
{"text":"I was happy to find the Ranger IPA on tap. Went to watch a football game with friends and found the tv screen side of things to be just right. The reason for 2 stars is the food. It reminded me a lot of cafeteria food in Junior High. I ordered a burger and found the quality of meat to be a bit low. I like that the fries still have the edge of the potato on them but they were far from crisp."}
{"text":"worst experience ever! if you want your food over 45 minutes later than eat at zipps! manager has no customer service either! 

i've been a server myself for over 10 years! i've never eaten somewhere where the service was so bad that it called for a review!!"}
{"text":"Zipps is always great for watching sports. Good people and great energy. The beer is always cold and the staff is always great. The food is sometimes hit or miss. I always order medium, golden wings...sometimes good, sometimes not so much. But I keep ordering them as more good than bad. Good flavor and sauce. Weak that they order for additional ranch. Zipps is a staple...always a good time!"}
{"text":"I ordered the blue cheeseburger ... I was surprised when I got it as there were two patties on the bun which was awesome however the bun was a fail. It was not appropriate for that burger very thin and not so fresh and not tasty at all so I ate the meat without the bun ... the atmosphere was great the service was good the beer was cold ... we will be back"}
{"text":"This is the newest Zipps in the valley and my favorite. The food is the most consistently delicious and I still stand by my previous statement that Zipps has the best bar food in the state!  Best wings, great burgers, awesome Monaco Facaccia. Great happy hour, reverse happy hour, and weekend specials. Fun atmosphere, bar games, and lots of TVs. I just named nine reasons why this place is great. I could go on.  Fantastic chicken strips, onion rings, and fries. They even have the best dipping sauces, like the ranch or the blue cheese or the jalapeno sauce. We're at twelve now. Want 15? Ok. The Zipparita, 32oz domestics on HH, and John Dalys. I like to give three examples at a time.  For example: Nice staff, reliable take out, convenient shuttle to games. 18. To be continued..."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sports bar food I've ever had.  Here's what I highly recommend: 

-Cheeseburgers: however you want it, they are excellent.
-The Monaco: one of the most popular items on the menu (just know though, these can be inconsistent.  Sometimes you get an amazing one, sometimes it is poor).
-Golden Chicken Wings: They have the best wings in town I think and if you ask for them \"golden\" they are even better.
-Chicken Strips tossed in wing sauce
-Cookie Skillet for dessert.  Not the best I've ever had (Oragano's has a better one), but it is good and huge!  It's about twice the size of Oregano's.
Great atmosphere and great place to get together with friends to watch the game.

The happy hour and reverse happy hour specials are very good for both food and drinks.

Here's another tip:  when they ask if you want fries or onion rings as a side, you can also do a 50/50 split.  Both the fries and onion rings are worth trying."}
{"text":"LOVE the atmosphere and all the TV's here! Great neighborhood sports bar! Moved right near their intersection and there were always lots of cars so checked it out! More tv's than I have ever seen in one place and size DOES matter here! LOL! Huge TV in the middle of the room divides the place but clarity is great! Every sport on you can imagine and the staff is more than willing to accoomodate any requests!  Yummy food, great service and bartenders and friendly people! Their veggie sandwich was really good compared to a lot of others places for us non-burger eating crowd! :) Cold beer, fresh cut fries and shuffle board! I will be returning soon! :)"}
{"text":"Zipps is weak.  It's really nice inside...but very loud (it is a sports bar).  My parents wanted some peace and quiet so we relocated out on to the patio.  Don't sit out here if you have an aversion to cigarette smoke.  In Arizona, people are still allowed to smoke on patios.  

I left Zipps with the feeling that days had been taken off my life just from the exposure to second-hand smoke.  I was expecting a lot more, but Zipps was a weak experience...but...it is a sports bar--a very loud one at that.  Food was fresh but it's nothing great.   

We had two waitresses..one was in training, so we cut her a little slack for the delay.  I had the BBQ-ranch chopped chicken salad.  Chicken was fresh off the grill and the lettuce was cool and crunchy, but it was so....elementary.  Then again...what can I expect from this type of restaurant?  

My parents loved their meal.  But how can you mess up a turkey sandwich, chicken noodle soup and a Greek salad?  I was eager to get home after the meal...after waiting 15 minutes for the bill I was extremely frustrated. 

Oh, if you ever feel the urge to go out and get drunk at all Goldie's and Zipp's locations, there is a shuttle available to fulfill your desire.  I pray the people who do this take a cab home at the end of the night."}
{"text":"Had the Swiss mushroom burger.  All of their 'specialty' burgers are double patties so the portion was good.  The cook's version of medium was unfortunately well-done, and I prefer rare, but understand that many places are uncomfortable cooking ground beef rare- hey they know where they get their supplies and sure don't.  They offer fries, sweet potato chips and onion rings which you can get as half and half, so we tried the chips and rings.  Excellent onion rings.  The chips were a little burned.  Eileen got a couple of pizza slices, but they are pretty big and she couldn't even finish one, so they went into a box.  The pizza was basic bar pizza fare, nothing special, but did come with shredded Parmesan on it.
Jenna R was an attentive and friendly server- thanks Jenna!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood sports bar. Staff is very friendly. The golden wings and the Focacci's are fantastic! My favorite is the Philly Cheesteak."}
{"text":"Went in the evening & was not impressed. Server didn't know anything about mixed drinks. Bartenders knowledge seemed pretty limited as well. Ordered a topshelf margarita which was okay. Also order a hurricane which was horribly made with too much almond oil. Place seems to only cater to beer & knows very little else."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. First, I ordered a side of French Fries, sent them back since they were freezing, and was provided a new side of fries. Second, got our bill, and was double charged for the fries. Good thing I look at watch I'm being charged for, bill was corrected.  Lastly, went to pay for the bill with a Visa Gift Card and was told they do not accept gift cards, only Zipp's gifts cards.  What?!?!  It is a Visa Gift Card, same as cash!!  If a family of 4 went there and ordered dinner relying on their Visa gift card, and had no other means of paying for their dinner, what would they do?!?!  No where do they have it displayed that they do not accept gift cards.  Probably should be plastered all over the front door, on every table, and at the bar.  Setting people up for severe failure.  I will never return for the sake of myself and others.  And I will let all others know for the sake of not being screwed over.  Absolutely ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"You know what you always are gonna get at Zipps. Although it seems like the burger specials are no longer."}
{"text":"This was such a GREAT night to come and have a drink! Not only did out waitress Alexis give us her undivided attention, but she was super playful getting our order and making sure we were well tended to. Thank you Zipps for having such GREAT team member. Alexis was wonderful!"}
{"text":"Everytime I go here I LOVE the food and HATE the service. The only thing that keeps me going back is the wings and burgers. If it's football season, count me out. No getting a refill on beer when it's busy!"}
{"text":"Yes.  Its a sports grill.  Its not fancy.  But they have some great menu items, lots of TVs and really good beer.  The Monaco Foccacia is a local fave but my favorite dinner is the Turcado or Chicado.  I order it with one patty...so yummy.  Don't order the fries and o.rings to go but DO eat them at the restaurant with a little salt.  When they're hot, they are good.  And listen...if you have a problem, ask for the manager.  In my experience, he will take care of you..."}
{"text":"I mean...Golden Wings. Does anything else need to be said? Also, the staff is awesome, just know it's going to get packed when big game are on. 

Pro tip: eat wings at the restaurant and do not order mild. You will have the best experience if you do :)"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. We waited an hour for our food, that happens, but the manager was the worst. We told him how horrible the experience was and first he made it clear that he was at no fault, then he decided to blame his server. After we insisted that it was indeed the establishment's fault, he offered us 20 zip bucks that were post dated. He wants us to come back????? Never! We only paid because we felt our server deserved a tip. Please do not go here. Zach is a TERRIBLE manager!!!"}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for two years, I walk here from my place Zerors for the manager of this place whose been there for four months but 5 stars for our server 

 When we had a problem with the bill we politlely tool the server our issue, maybe it's because we are regulars and have been given a different price for our drinks. 

Honestly the manager asked me for receipts on past drinks to prove me wrong about being priced wrong sorry,  but who keeps receipts for drinks

Needless to say we're not returning."}
{"text":"Better today. I'm glad. I gave this place another chance because I enjoy the appetizers. I like this place and hate to diss them. I guess it depends upon who is working. The skewers were bomb. Great service, beer and food. Good job today Zipps."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. The waitress made a mistake and charged us for an extra drink. The manager refused to remove it from the bill and called the COPS on us over a $4 drink... That we didn't order or drink. After 20 minutes of talking to various managers, who claim to have surveillance video of this non-existant drink, we offered to just pay for it so we could leave. They held our bill until after the cops arrived hoping we would leave without paying for anything. The cops were awesome and said they get called to Zipps (all locations) a lot over things like this. The owner of this place should be embarrassed at how customers are treated. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Service was very slow at lunch.  Tasty food though.  Wings don't seem as hot as they once were."}
{"text":"Very good veggie burger that you can sub into their different types of burgers...I got the thousand island one.  yum!  Great happy hour prices, plus the bartender was knowledgeable and generous w/the alcohol.  The waitress was super attentive even tho' it was packed in there and food came out FAST!

Fries are very good but onion rings were greasy and chewy...ick!

The patio is ALL smoking, so don't expect to sit outside unless you want lung cancer!"}
{"text":"This place is great. They have awesome service with good food to match. My friends and I have been coming here since 2005 and we will always go back. Their golden wings are good, but their focaccias are even better."}
{"text":"I have always been a huge Zipps fan. Unfortunately, this location is atrocious!! Service is appalling and the food is sub par. After waiting nearly 45 minutes for the food... it came out cold. When asking for warm/hot food the sever and manager acted irritated. After another 20 minutes our food came back. It was as expected. I truly think that the ENTIRE staff of this location would strongly benefit from visiting other successful Zipps locations. I know that I will be making the drive to a different location for future Zipps visits."}
{"text":"Went at 10pm at night for some food and drinks.  There was only 4 tables occupied when we got there, self seated as the sign at hostess said.  Proceeded to wait 9 minutes for one of the 7 servers there to acknowledge us.  Placed order and drinks all at once as we already knew we probably wouldn't see the server again.  Saw out food sit at the expo window for 7 minutes before our server who was just talking to other severs saw it.  Food came out cold.  Terrible service and the whole time the manager wearing a camp blackhawks hat stood there and talked to one of his friends."}
{"text":"Solid blue cheese burger. Good wings. Ten dollar pitchers on Sunday's! Nice legs mandatory for waitresses and lots of tvs."}
{"text":"You definitely get what you pay for here. Basic bar food that tastes good enough. Service is just never very good unfortunately. It's the same at all locations! Often just feel ignored!"}
{"text":"Love the jalapeño burger. Eat half and take the other half in your lunch to work the next day. Delicious."}
{"text":"I so wanted a yummy bar burger. Had never been to this one but really liked the other Zipps around town. So disappointed though.  My little burger was not very good but the onion rings and fries were down right bad. Onion ring batter is just odd. Maybe they use a corn meal or something? The fries were very floppy but not in that yummy greasy way. Just like when they are re-warmed the next day.  I didn't even like the cola, which I never complain about.  It was so sweet. The reason they get two stars is the waitress was very sweet, although slow getting to me."}
{"text":"Poor experience thanks to an unfriendly manager.  After waiting almost an hour, which was fine, the hostess took us to our table where we ordered drinks and our dinner. The drinks came and then the manager for our section came to our table and accused us of sneaking in and swiping it. He didn't believe us when we said this is where the hostess sat us. He wanted our beeper number!  Which we gave him. Instead of just asking the hostess in the first place he decided to accuse his customers of stealing a table. After he verified we were legit he stayed away from our table. A simple \"sorry guys\" would have sufficed. The waitress was good and the food was good though. They did charge extra for the Caesar dressing for the chicken Caesar I had. We won't come back."}
{"text":"For an overall experience, this is my favorite sports bar in our neighborhood. 

The food is excellent....fantastic burgers and wings.....and don't pass up on the chance to order the half and half fry/onion ring combo...good sized portions as well.  The price is right....great happy hour and daily specials.

Service has always been good; the place is clean and has good sports bar ambience.  And it's a place you can be just as comfortable at when out with the family, as when you are with your friends.  (Refreshing.....seriously, what type of awful parents take their kids to Hooters or The Tilted Kilt?)"}
{"text":"Terrible service! A group of us came in for lunch today and were seated at small table for 6. Our 7th person came in and we asked if we could move a small table over to give us room to eat. The waitress was going to allow it but the manager (male) came out to say that we could not have an additional table because he would need it for the upcoming U of A game which was starting in an hour and a half. We were going to eat lunch and have cocktails but decided instead to leave since it was such a burden to serve us. Z Tejas was more than happy to take our business."}
{"text":"Stopped in here last Sunday for the first time. Was gonna have lunch, a couple beers and watch the game. Ordered a beer and the bartender asked for a credit card to hold. Since I'm not in the habit of giving strangers my credit cards 'to hold', I politely told her no, I'm not gonna do that. She then told  me I must pay as I go.
   A very poor policy for someone who is almost 50, dressed appropriately and usually tips well. 
  Needless to say, I stayed for one beer (which seemed a bit overpriced considering)  and went elsewhere for lunch!
  Good job on the first impression!
  I won't be back.
  While this may be a common practice for college bars serving kids, it's certainly not the standard Where adults patronize!"}
{"text":"Great bar food. Focaccias, sweet jalapeño burgers, and golden wings are great. Onion rings look amazing but are bland."}
{"text":"I love Zipps. It is a great location to meet friends because it is in the central of phoenix. I love there golden style wings and the happy hour is great. I love the zipperitas, the best flavor is strawberry. I love when it is on happy hours because it can range from half off or a dollar off, depending on the day. I love the environment, especially when there is a really good game on. It is a good date..because your boyfriend will be happy with all the sports that is going on and because of the good food."}
{"text":"Best food at a sports bar hands down. Our server Natalie is Amazing! Great personality, very attentive, and wonderful smile!"}
{"text":"Watched one nfl game..crowd was good. I liked the food but didn't like the service..."}
{"text":"Sweetest waitress wish I could remember her name! Cold beers, good food and a great time. Kids loved their quesadillas (LOL) and I got a nice juicy burger. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We usually only come for the dangerously strong and delicious Zipparitas. The service is usually good--not too pushy/annoying, but not absent either. The reason I took away a star is that I've ordered fries multiple times and they are always soggy and saturated with oil. When we get them \"extra crispy\" they just get extra oily and gross. We'll still be back for those margs though."}
{"text":"Best wings in a decade, they were absolutely perfect!!! coupled with massive $4 bud light drafts, and Excellent service! Best Happy Hour in town... by far!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Zipp's location I have been too (used to frequent the Camelback & Mill locations). I'm shocked at all of these bad reviews, they must have never been to any of the other ones. This Zipps is clean(er), staff is friendlier, large & open floor plan, and the food & drinks are good. At the other Zipps they would make a big deal if I ordered my wings a certain way, and here they allow it, so that's a huge plus for me (Tip: order wings naked with Cajun seasoning - game changer). We are new to the area &the sports bar scene isn't great - this Zipps is definitely the leading contender."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE lover of Zipps.. my bf & I, as well as my softball team, frequent the miller & camelback (old town Scottsdale) location at least once a week (normally like 2 times/week) & I have zero complaints.. this one on the other hand, oh my gosh. Where do I start:

We came this weekend, yes during the Tempe Arts Fest, but I was surprised at how not crowded it was, I have seen this place packed before for big games,.. but not this day, easy to get a table. So we find a table no problem, but it hasn't been cleaned yet, dirty plates and napkins on it, no big deal, but 10-15 minutes go by and no one has come by. Finally we stop a waitress and she apologizes and takes our order. We asked for two waters and a pitcher of Ranger. A few minutes later a lady comes with one 32 oz beer, nope we ordered a pitcher. Okay no big deal again..  and then the pitcher comes. Then we see her 10 minutes later and I ask for waters again, still nothing. Finally I was so thirsty I went up to the bar to order a water. Then we decided the slowness is crazy so we get the bill since we had to catch the light rail to Chase Field. We get the check & she didn't charge us the correct price for the pitcher, $15 instead of $10 (HH).. oh and that's all we got so its not like it was too challenging. So my bf goes and tells her the price is incorrect. Then I get the check back, and she ran my card for $25.. I'm guessing the $10 + $15? I was like oh my goshhhh how can this lady be SO bad at her job???? Like at least can someone tell us she's new or something?Then I would be way more understanding. But it was unreal, one error after another after another."}
{"text":"Great late night option for food in this area. Chicken fingers were super fluffy and hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service! Manager has no people skills and treats customers like he can do no wrong. What a jerk ! He messes up and takes no responsibility !"}
{"text":"So, I finally went to Zipps last night with my roommate. It wasn't too packed even though it was game one of the World Series. We sat in the bar area, and started off getting nachos. The server did a great job and was very attentive, but the amount of chips definitely left something to be desired. We both ordered a different foccaccia sandwich and were totally confused when we got our food, 35-40 minutes later. I know that foccaccia is a type of bread and was expecting the sandwich I ordered to be on that bread, when in actuality it was a wrap. This struck me as odd, now our server did an excellent job except that we were not even offered a refill of the chips we got, and the food took an ungodly long amount of time when the bar itself was not even that busy."}
{"text":"The absolute worst. 35 times out of 40 this year we have had horrible service. We come back for the food but are allllways upset about the lack of care from servers. Wrong orders, food comes at staggered times, drinks and food have come an hour after we sat down numerous times, managers offer $5 zipps bucks instead of taking care of issues. This place ONLY survives off good, cheap food.  Calling corporate asap. Someone fix this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Zipps has good bar food, but the service is usually horrible. The waitresses rarely come to your table. BUT, what really rubs me the wrong way is this....
On multiple occasions, when I pay the bill, the waiter doesn't bring me back the correct change. Even if my change is 1 cent, I'm entitled to receive my money back. 
I'm sorry, but not giving me back my  change because you deem it insignificant doesn't float well with me. They do have great food though."}
{"text":"Service was off an on, for a few minutes they would check on us and serve us and then five minutes later they would be no where to be seen, when we first arrived we waited almost 10 minutes before even getting a drink and a menu, fries and onion rings were HORRIBLE. Worst I've ever eaten. Pizza is good, and fish tacos are alright. But I will not be returning. And seriously who doesn't have honey bbq or even just bbq wings. Seriously. Worst thing ever."}
{"text":"I've been to 2 of the Zipps locations and they were both rather identical. Sports bar, lots of TVs, attractive waitresses (important to a lot of guys from what I've experienced..haha), and decent bar food. 

The service was good- the waitresses have been very attentive, bringing refills on soft drinks, and offering to get another round of brew for the table. With their many TVs, they always have the \"big game\" on :) 

As for the food, I only ate one of the two times I went to Zipps, but I had a chicken wrap and a side salad... pretty darn delicious actually. It's pretty hard to go wrong with a chicken wrap, right? :)"}
{"text":"Never got my food. Horrendous service. If you want cheap crap drinks, i guess this should be good. Otherwise, please go somewhere else."}
{"text":"aside from the delicious Monaco Focaccia and Zipparitas, this location also has great customer service. I've only every had a problem with the food once and it was overcooked fries, but the staff was polite when i brought it up and the replaced them with no problem."}
{"text":"This place serves awful food, I got food poisoning from this location and couldn't stop going to the bathroom for over 48 hours strait.... this places management is full of excuses, instead of fixing the problem, they are the problem. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"We started with the beer cheese and pretzels. The cheese was lack luster. They used white cheddar and cream cheese. Not a \"Wow\".  My husband ordered a new salad that was more like a dressing soup ($11).  They need to hire John Taffer to redo their menu. It's ok, just not great."}
{"text":"Plain & Simple their happy hour rocks and their nightly specials are the best. $5 dozen wings, and FYI the HOT is like,  \"hello I'm going to scorch your mouth and you're going to need 4 of their $3 32oz beers lined up to chased the burn\" but it's SOOO damn good. Their Zipparittas are also awesome and the wait staff are all super awesome friendly at this locale."}
{"text":"We always have a good time in the FLW Zipps but sometimes a long wait on food prep. The golden wings are delicious as are the focaccia  sandwiches. Great place day or night with family or friends."}
{"text":"We LOVE coming to Zipps for lunch and dinner, but mostly for happy hour! Their happy hour specials are fantastic. I love the zipparitas as well as their wings. Great atmosphere. My boyfriend loves sports, plus the show PAC 12 games and this is the place to watch! Many large screen TVs. We have never had a complaint or problem here. If you're looking for somewhere for a quiet conversation pick somewhere else. Perfect for large parties and sports fans."}
{"text":"Great burger and salads. Wife and I love the food. I love the sports and the numerous tv's. One of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"Shame on Zipps for opposing a new Z Tejas at Bethany Home and 16th St,  Afraid of a little competition."}
{"text":"Terrible wings and the worst restaurant on mill. They charge extra for sauce. Not to mention we were at zipps for over an hour and never had our waters refilled. Not much else you need to know. Try any other sports bar if you want to watch a game."}
{"text":"Really not worth your time. A new place called Philly's opened across the street if you are in the area and want to go to a bar. The food in my opinion is never very good. They have these thin cut fries that always come out soggy. Also they have rules about the number of certain drinks you can have which are not followed."}
{"text":"So much better (food) than some of the other Zipps in town. Wings and an Ice cold beer..Mmmmm. Good drink specials every day of the week."}
{"text":"Golden wings and the Monaco..need I say more!!! Good place for day or night drinking.. Get there early on game days if you want to get a seat. Great specials everyday. The zipparitas aren't to shabby either. Great local sports bar."}
{"text":"My friend and I came into this location for our first time and sat at the bar for a early lunch and cold drink. Brianna greeted us so graciously as soon as we walked in and never stopped smiling. She is so attentive to our needs and requests. Hands down this was the most pleasant experience I have had at a restaurant/bar. It is clear and evident which Zipps location i will be a permanent fixture at! This location is extremely fortunate to have Brianna as an extension of its core values and beliefs. The best bartender ever!"}
{"text":"Food is great here however the only reason they won't even get 5 stars is because their customer service is amongst the worst I have ever had. I go back because I love their wings and fries. I recommend golden hot wings they're spicy but so delicious. However, they have got to have the worst service ever. After delivering your food, you will not see the server again and have to literally hunt them down to get your check. Oh and good luck if you don't like your food because they won't even check in with you in that regard. Managers suck as well. Also, don't order for pick up since they have a tendency to give orders to incorrect people which has happened to me on two occasions. I was very upset and the manager had absolutely nothing to say and didn't even apologize. He did absolutely nothing (and I was on my lunch break) with that being said I didn't eat all day that day thanks to their lack of absolutely everything possible."}
{"text":"Love this place, the happy hour is always great! Also Alyssa is a great server and will acknowledge you! She's quick and has the best personality! And the food good here too!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night. The food was ok, the service was good. It seemed like a lot of fried fare on the menu. The kid had chicken strips that were really greasy. I had the tenderloin focaccia and my wife had the philly focaccia. Mine was ok, was lacking in the tenderloin dept. I also had the hot wings, which were pretty good. I'd consider this more of a happy hour/ have drinks place. I'll skip on the food next time."}
{"text":"ARROGANT and RUDE!!!
When we first came in they took forever to even address us even though the bartender looked right at us 3 or 4 times.  Once our waitress finally came to the table she acted like we were interrupting her day. We ordered drinks and asked for menus.  She brought the drinks and never returned with menus but instead went back to the bar to talk to her co-workers.  My friend had to go to the bar to ask for menus again.  Our waitress handed my friend a menu (ONE) but never come over to take our order.
We got sick of waiting, left money on the table and walked out.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME & MONEY!"}
{"text":"Ordered wings to go from here many times over the years & it was solid. Recently tried it again though, & unfortunately I got some pretty bad food poisoning. Ordered two items that night: golden wings & corn dog basket. Not sure which was the culprit, but man oh man, it did not end well. 

Gets 1 star just for the previous track record before this incident."}
{"text":"I love most Zipps. This location though is seriously lacking.  We went with a party of 6 and it wasn't very busy.  We were seated right away but man was our service bad.  We had Jenna as a waitress.  She was rude, slow and generally didn't care for the customer. We asked to order when we sat down because we are all very familiar with the menu and were hungry.  Jenna said we couldn't order yet because she wasn't ready.  I'm not making this up.  All of our food was cold when received it.  We said something to both the gentleman that brought our food and Jenna. The funny part was neither cared. It is really a shame knowing how good zipps can be yet this location is being ruined due to its staff.  There are way too many other options then to go to a place where you're treated like this."}
{"text":"This is my Sunday staple.  All the Zipps in the valley have excellent burgers,  wings and fantastic drink specials.  The TV situation is set prior so you can't switch them based on seating.  They almost always have the Chicago Bears sound on,  which is prefect for me."}
{"text":"The one star is because it's a clean place with good A/C and they have shuffleboard. Came her on a late Saturday afternoon hoping to get a bite to eat, have some beers and watch the preliminary UFC fights on Fox sports. The restaurant was pretty much empty and the bar had about 15 people around it watching one of the many tv's playing various sports. When we first came in we asked the hostess if would be able to get one of the tvs changed to fox sports, she said she couldn't but she would find someone who could. We took a place at the bar. Although they weren't busy at all the bartender didn't even acknowledge us because he was too busy flirting with two blonds at the end of the bar. After 7 minutes (yes I timed it) I finally said something to get his attention and we ordered two large draft beers. When he brought them back we asked about changing on of the tvs to fox sports. He said he wasn't sure he could change them and said we didn't care what tv we would even move to a table in a corner where no one was if needed. He left to ask someone and came back and said they were \"having issues\" and he wouldn't be able to change any of the TV's. No other explanation given to what kind of issue. Finished our beer and left went to another nearby bar,  Tukee's. Had a much better experience there."}
{"text":"Food was not good, burgers were terrible, our food was cold and the service was horrible at this location.  It was not very busy. I was shocked. I have been to other locations and they have been great."}
{"text":"went last night, fairly busy but not jammed, immediately seated.  very noisy, which you might expect from a sports bar, duh, but also lots of kids seated in main dining area.  Order taken fairly quickly but had to wait 35 minutes for simple order.  we were about to walk out when food finally arrived.  my nachos we pretty bad with smallish amounts of guacamole and salsa, cheese glob bed up or unmelted.  Microwave not broiler?  I could have asked waitress for more, but did not see her again until meal finished.  Disappointed and will not go back."}
{"text":"We used to enjoy Zipp's for the food primarily. The atmosphere is something you just dealt with:it's always loud with TV's blasting some game. Ok fine, it's a sports bar. Our last trip (and it will be our last trip) was disappointing on all account. We ordered the wings this time since our former favorite cheese sticks have been less than stellar the past two visits. The wings were decent enough. We should've stopped there. We both ordered burgers, medium, with fries and onion rings. The burger had zero flavor, not even a hint of seasoning. They were well done, greasy and just not good. The fries and onion rings were the biggest disaster-a pile of something may have been crispy at some point during the day but was served as a batch of greasy crumbles. Greasy doesn't even describe how bad they were. I don't know if their fryer wasn't hot enough or clean enough. Or both. You'd think they would be embarrassed plating something that horrible looking but clearly they don't care. Based on our past two experiences there we will not be back. It's too bad, they used to be good. They may survive for a little while on the backs of regulars but ultimately this level of quality will catch up with them."}
{"text":"I know here especially when it's football season. Great buffalo wings... And other food. It's just a great place to go to watch the game drink beer and eat good sport bar food.

Service is fast and friendly... It's a big open space with lots of TVs

You really can't go wrong when you want to watch a big sporting event"}
{"text":"The drinks were awesome and strong BUT the food was soooooo gross . I hate to waste money but I just couldn't eat it I ordered the veggie burger and fries and both were gross and my friend ordered buffalo chicken tenders and seeep potatoes chips and didn't eat them so two stars for drinks"}
{"text":"I can't really see any other reason to frequent this place other than the ridiculously cheap drink specials and to watch the game on a good amount of nice TVs.  Other than that, service is lacking, and the food leaves something to be had.  The chicken noodle soup that my friend had looked like it came out of a can, and his pizza did not look that appetizing either.  He loved them, but he was also severely hungover and a Scottsdale tool.  From previous reviews, I was warned not to get a salad, but I don't like the nasty bar food they serve, so a salad it was.  Horribly put together, with sad pieces of iceberg lettuce.

Again, only the cheap drinks and TVs save this place."}
{"text":"So impressed! Why haven't we tried this place before ?! 1st tip is to check out the happy hour menu .. dirt cheap deals baby! The restaurant is huge , my daughter counted 13 tvs! This will be a fantastic place to celebrate football season (go pats) . We were a party of 3 , we each ordered an entree . I had the chicken skewers With Buffalo sauce and ranch , plus a slice of cheese pizza , my husband had the BBQ chicken sandwich with fries , my daughter had the 1,000 island burger and onion rings .. we also split an appetizer of chips ,salsa and guacamole . Total bill was $30. Like I said ,dirt cheap deals. The onion rings were the best ! Pizza was good , not my favorite , but for $1.50 a slice you are definitely getting your money worth. The burger was huge and my daughter thought it was amazing . The star of the show was the chicken skewers . You get a basket full of them with your choice of 2 dipping sauces for $6.50 during happy hour . The service was spectacular. All in all 5 stars all the way. This is a place I look forward to returning to over and over again ."}
{"text":"Ended our night on Mill after St. Patrick's Day weekend at Zipps. Really all we wanted was some decent bar food after a night a drinking. We sat at the bar and it took about 10 minutes to be greeted even though the bar was not very busy at all. We asked for some menu's and water and it took about another 5 minutes for the water. I decided to order some green chile and chicken spring rolls with cheese. My friend got some turkey chili. It took about another 15 to 20 minutes for the food to come out and I watched it sit there for another few minutes before the bartender/waitress even saw it which was a little ridiculous with how slow they seemed.

The chicken spring rolls were actually really good and they were served with a sweet jalapeno sauce which complemented them nicely. My friend's turkey chili was really good but very spicy, so be prepared for that if you order this.

Overall the food was pretty good. Service was slow. If I was in the area again and needed some apps and beer this might be a stop I would make. Return factor 50/50"}
{"text":"I received horrible service. The waitress \"forgot\" to bring our drink as we watched another table get served and well after we arrived. I had to ask another staff member for our drinks. The food was delicious! However, we waited 20+ mins after she dropped our check off to pay. I actually had to get up and walk to the bar and ask for someone to please run my card. It will be awhile before I return.... if ever!"}
{"text":"I've ventured here many times for lunch and always sit at the bar.  The service has always been pretty delightful.

I seem to always find myself getting the turkey chili, LOVE IT!!!
One night, for dinner, I got a bowl of turkey chili and it was nothing but turkey, zero broth.  I ended up packing it up, taking it home and making it a sandwich, gooooooood!!!  And, it's only $5!

BUT, went there last week and we stood at the front waiting for a host/ess.  Dude walks past and greets us and keeps walking...  Uh....ok?  Finally, a chick walks up, says nothing, doesn't even make eye contact, just sticks out her hand at me waving a flashing vibrating (what are those things called?), still no eyes...?
There are five empty tables by the way.  
Uh, woo hoo, hello, chicken?
Pointing, there are empty tables....?
Now, if looks could kill or if any look demanded your stupidity be made aware of, this was it!  
No, those are ONLY for four or more people.

Obviously we left and B*tch is lucky she didn't get bashed across the head with that blue light flashing vibrating plastic square brick of a thing (WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS CALLED?)

Yes, I'll go back, probably refrain from dinner time though..."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to zips on a regular basis. I don't enjoy seeing family and their kids running around like it's a zoo. I feel for the staff when you're trying to do a job and they got kids whose parents pay no attention to. And you wonder why. There's not much on the menu that I really could care for other than really cold beers and some tasty wings. Long story short this place works for us. The fried food is good. I mean hey it's fried food right. By no means this is a four-star dining experience for two lovers out on the town. But at the same time it's also a place for people to go and chill. If my kids were acting out of bounds in any establishment. I would be totally embarrassed and feel like a complete moron for not correcting my children in any establishment where it pays to have manners."}
{"text":"We liked zipps&told our friends,the best fish&chips around.Two times ago fries were old(bad)The manager said next time he will give 1/2 off.The next time every thing was good.This time(11-03-17)@7:30 p.m.the fish was really greasy&like double breaded(Bad)"}
{"text":"I'm from western New York originally so I've had some pretty amazing wings in my day, but I gotta say that Zipp's golden wings are perhaps the best I've ever had.  I'm hooked.  I have to have them at least a few times a month.  Sometimes two consecutive nights."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome food! Seriously, wings are great and their burgers were even better. Service was just right- very genuine and not overdone!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time and will definitely be back! Bartender was very attentive and food was delicious. Only suggestion would be to carry some local craft beers. Other than that, great spot!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst places I have been to. They took ages to serve the food. (The place wasn't crowded). The quality of food was decent. There are much better places on mill avenue and i would not recommend this to anyone if you care about your time."}
{"text":"If you want to watch t.v. and enjoy a cold beer, Zipps is fine. If you want good food, go elsewhere. There is much better bar food to be had at almost anywhere.


Onion Rings...very oily
French Fries...Fresh cut, but they come out very soggy and poor flavor.
Green Chili Burger...Decent
Wings...Okay

Service has been very slow all three times I have been here."}
{"text":"The service is so-so here, but the great appetizers, food and drinks help make up for it, not to mention the 15+ TVs for live games.  Try the Medium Golden Wings with a side of the Hot Sauce...  Best flippin' wings in PHX/Scottsdale and I'll be back for more this football season.

We'll, I was pleased with my experience until I found something in my onion rings...  Ruined the entire experience and I'll make sure to pull this from my Bookmarks.

Bummer!  They were off to a good start, then crashed and burned.  Giving them 3 stars because the manager comped a round of beers and the staff showed that they care."}
{"text":"Solid 2-2.5 each time we have visited, including last night. We decided to forego our usual sport bar and we were hoping to catch the Broncos-Packers preseason game. Wanted to go to the sports bar very near Zipps but they were PACKED so, ignoring our intuition, which was screaming to just go to our usual place, we decided to just try Zipps. Again. Even though they never impress us. The place was greater than half empty yet it took several minutes for the hostess to notice us, and then, immediately after asking us if we wanted a booth or table and us answering, she told us she forgot our answer and asked the same question again. Wanted to sit in the bar area at a table but a sign clearly says no children in that area and since we had the teenager with us we were banished to the \"dining area\". No drink list. That honestly is a big annoyance to me, especially when I see multiple beer taps. I placed my bet there that my server would be unable to recite the beers on tap. By the time a server finally came to us, I had forgotten that bet. The greater than 10 minutes we waited just to meet our server were filled with me suppressing the urge to just get up and walk out. When she finally arrived at the table, she thanked us for waiting, although it's still unclear why we waited because there was a total of 8 tables in that area and there were several servers just standing near the kitchen window-presumably waiting for food, but standing for extended periods of time nonetheless. As I suspected, she was only able to name 4-5 draft beers. She told me they had Citradelic IPA so I finally said I would just have that. What ended up coming was NOT an IPA at all, tasted more like Budweiser and I don't drink that crap. We asked for a few minutes with the menu. It's not their fault, but I just wasn't in te mood for burgers or fried food, and none of the healthier options were sparking my interest. It took greater than 10 more minutes for her to return for our food order. Right now I will say that while mildly neglectful, she was at least nice. When I asked whether they had an IPA in a bottle, she replied she didn't know and would check. I told her my current beer was horrible and she did offer to take it back and bring something else but my boyfriend said he would drink it. At that point, I ordered a Lagunitas, a choice which had not originally been offered. My point here is that Zipps management should realize that not every customer of their establishment will order the \"usual\", so having a beer list would alleviate the annoyance to both customers and servers when ordering. Ordered a Zipps chop salad, server let me add grilled chicken to that, description read it was Zipps version of a wedge with blue cheese crumbles and bacon pieces. The salad I got was topped with what I presume is feta (at which point I had regret for not just ordering the Greek salad), microscopic bacon pieces (and very few at that), ice burg lettuce made up the majority of the bowl, and the chicken-which was the good part of the salad. Let me just say that this salad in a bowl was $9. At CK's bar, I get the same size salad that comes as their side salad with WAYYY more bacon and other toppings, for $4 and change. Kid had BBQ burger which looked delicious. His fries were average-seemed fresh cut-everything was hot so that's a plus. Boyfriend got the turkey on rye which he said was \"just ok\". It was at this point that we decided that this was probably our last visit to Zipps because why continue to have underwhelming sports bar experiences in the Awhatukee area when you have choices with better food and service-like Brad's, Philly's, CK's, and even Bleacher's and Tukees?  Should've gone with any of those last night. Oh yeah, one last thing. The Cards preseason game was ending as we sat down-that game was on most of the televisions. After that finished up, the whole bar was forced to watch American Ninja Warrior and then high school baseball-i acknowledge that in a sports bar here is a place for that, but for 80% of Zipps tvs to be displaying that was just one more reason we won't be back."}
{"text":"Slow service and manager that didn't really care. Took 45min to get two of our drinks when we first got there (they didn't even come out until after our appetizers came out). Ordered a blue moon when our entrees arrived and it never came, after over 30min and then us being done eating and ready for our check. Manager danced around apologizing and basically said they were busy and couldn't help the slow service. He was a bit condescending and actually interrupted our conversation with him to cheer at the football game. It was obvious he didn't care at all and the conversation with him essentially turned out to be utterly pointless.

Learned a couple days later after my sister emailed Zipps that that Manager quit or was fired. Learned that the server we had quit after that night too, which was unfortunate to hear since it really wasn't her fault at all and she was doing the best she could.

Also, the nachos came with about a full cup or more of sour cream on top and little else. Pretty unappetizing."}
{"text":"So a gal walks into a bar...

I've been in the bar business and I know the rules.  The rules are: it's a \"bartender's bar\" and it's a \"customer's table\".  You may not like that, you may never have heard that, but in the bar biz, that's true.  

Now, no one should confuse any of that with \"the customer is always right\".  Confusing?  Not really.

So I walk into Zipps, and I order a vodka and Red Bull and I explain to the bartender that I want a glass large enough to allow for the full shot of vodka and the whole can of Red Bull.  that's the portion.  He gives me like an 8oz rocks glass with vodka but there's no room for the Red Bull, as I had tried to avoid.  When I protest, he says he does not have a glass large enough to hold both.  

\"What about that glass?\" I asked as I pointed.  \"Oh, that's a Pilsner glass.  It's only for beer.\"

Hell, whenI ran a bar, I would give a customer a shot of 25 year old McCallan Scotch in a Martini Up glass, however inappropriate it might be.  S/he can order it any way s/he wants.  But not at Zipps.

\"Wait.  You can't use a Pilsner glass for my vodka/Red Bull because....\"

\"Because it's only for beer.\"

\"Wait.  You don't wash it afterwards?\"

He just stared at me.  I just stared at him.  Dude was seriously challenged.

I don't care how good the blue cheeseburger was.  I can't call my glass, they don't get my money.  Hamburger money or vodka/Red Bull money."}
{"text":"Zipps is my husband and my favorite restaurant.  We LOVE the food.  Love is almost an understatement.  Their sweet jalapeno sauce is to die for.....The service is for the most part pretty good....but the food makes up for it if the servers are busier than normal.  The only bad thing is if it's too crowded inside, you have to sit on the patio with all of the smokers which is gross especially when trying to eat, but they have to cater to everyone.  All in all, get the jalapeno burger or the monacco foccacia.  DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly but extremely slow. We ordered burgers, fries, and onion rings. The burgers were \"okay\" but the buns were cold and the lettuce too wet.  The french fries and onion rings were in edible.  They were so bad, I asked if they were pre-fried in a large quantity, put under a heat lamp, and set waiting until ordered.  They were greasy, cold, and horrible. In their defense,Right after the food was delivered, Alex did stop by to see how everything was.  We just don't send food back as it should be done right the first time.   We never saw our waitress after the food was delivered until long after the bill was due. We sat with dirty dishes, never had any refills on our beverages, and we were never asked if we wanted anything else. Other staff clearly saw us looking around for a waitress, but never offered to help and never sent our waitress."}
{"text":"Didn't realize this was right down the street from my house. Food is pretty good and priced appropriately.  There is a ton of Tvs to watch football so I take my kids on Sunday.  

Reason for not having 5 stars: 

1. Trying to tell me that I couldn't drink my Monster drink from outside.  Use judgement. I am coming in with 2 kids on a Sunday.  Do you really think I'm curbing your alcohol sales?
2. Fly in the restaurant constantly circling my food. I understand the door opens frequently but still.  

In summary, I will be back."}
{"text":"I know, I know it's a sports bar but yes I did get a Cesar salad with the recommended Cajun chicken... And it was delicious! The burgers did look good, and next time I will be getting the black and blue burger. BUT If you are trying to be healthy or want to eat light, I highly recommend the Cesar salad with Cajun chicken."}
{"text":"Went there this morning for NFL. They would not open their doors until 11 even though there were about 20 people waiting at the door to get in. Every other sports bar in the area opens at 9 or 10. To make it worse they do not serve breakfast which caused people to leave. It is football season ! Let people in and serve breakfast!"}
{"text":"Love love love the food and Zipparitas but the service has gone way downhill. My go-to here is the chicken skewers with golden buffalo sauce. Last night they tasted a little more mustardy than I remembered last time I went but were still good. I also love their baskets of fries and onion rings. 

Now for the service. Our waitress first off forgot my son's beverage, which in my opinion, is the most important one at the table. Don't forget the kid's drink!!! She also never offered us waters which should be a must when everyone is also having alcoholic beverages. She was not very friendly and never smiled. The service got worse towards the end. She never brought us our bill and we had to go find a manager to hunt her down. We are normally are very patient when we go out to eat and we realize they were very busy last night but it got to the point of being ridiculous with the amount of time she was gone. 

I still tipped the waitress but Zipps needs to do a better job staffing this location with friendlier, more attentive people. I'll also still go for happy hour with friends for my favorite Zipparitas but I'm not coming back with family for dinner."}
{"text":"Zipps is an amazing sports bar. I'm always there on Sundays to watch sports mostly football. The burgers are great like the jalapeño burgers. The girls wear football jerseys and are always friendly. The TV's combine and make one huge screen. There are a lot of cool fans that show up too"}
{"text":"Zipps is the best sports bar for me on Mill. I come with my friend Eddie and we get drunk (well he does) we take chicks here and the girls are always friendly. They combine the screens together to make one big screen so I watch my Bears at home and then watch them shitty raiders with him lol jk I'm an Honorary fan for the homies. The girls are always friendly and wear football jerseys during the season and it's always fun to watch games. I'm a little drunk doing this review but fuck it I'll take an Uber home  so shout out to the girls and the management!. Caleigh is always helpful to me. She's been my waitress for a long time. The other waitress Cierra is cool as well. Ask for the waitresses Britaney and Malisia. They usually wait on me as well and are always helpful. Also NO SURPRISE ZIPPS. You have a drunk being annoying as shit complaining to his friends about a stupid play when I come on a regular basis. It was effecting the girls working because it was right next to their station. So they get the manager and the manager goes \"well what do you expect this is a sports bar\" hahahahaha I expect you to have some balls and say something before a fight breaks out you idiot. You have loyal customers like me that are trying to go and enjoy the game and you can't be bothered. That's disgusting bro. 

Update: I want to thank the GM Devin for taking the time to personally apologize about that situation as well as Tiffany from their corporate. I will be returning because they are handling the situation"}
{"text":"Gross. Found a hair in my food & when I told my waiter...he didn't believe me?! This place will never get my business again."}
{"text":"This was the WORST EXPERIENCE I've ever had! It took 45 minutes to get our food. Ask the manager to come over and he did not care. One of our friends didn't even get his food at all. As we were leaving the hinge fell off the door and almost hit one of our children's heads walking out the door. I can tell you none of the three family that we were with every back to this location.!"}
{"text":"While I went to ASU, I worked at the Melting Pot in this complex and would visit Zipps almost nightly after work. The staff at the time was awesome - however, with as much as we went in there, and being in the industry, they rarely helped you out on your tab. If you're not in the industry, you wouldn't understand, but for anyone that works in the biz, you know that most bartenders will slide you a few (especially if you and around 5-10 people come in nightly). Anyway, not the staffs fault, just a REALLY overwhelming ownership from what I am told. 

But I still enjoyed it because the food is really good for a bar. The wings (golden) are really, really good. They do a wing night, or used to, when they were like half off. The monico foccacia is really good, too. 

A great place to watch a game, shoot some pool and have a bite to eat. And you won't feel dirty after being there all day."}
{"text":"Mmmmm mmmmmm mmmmmm! All these people bitching about a .50 cent ranch charge when you get a DOUBLE patty burger WITH a side for 8.95! That's a deal. Go cry about ranch someplace else."}
{"text":"We visited this location on a Saturday afternoon and we didn't have to wait to be seated. Our waitress was pretty nice at first. My husband and I each ordered one of their sandwiches with a side of fries. The fries were very greasy and mushy. They were not appetizing at all. I left most of them on my plate. The sandwich honestly looked like something I could have made at home and it didn't taste any better. As we were eating, we noticed the place began to get a little more crowded. That was when the service from our waitress got bad. She never came back to refill our drinks or ask if we needed anything. She simply came by to give us our bill. It was like she was rushing us out. Very rude. I will not be going back, the food really sucked and the service really sucked."}
{"text":"We walked in and no one was there to help us find a seat, next the patio seating is only if you're 21+ and last the food is TERRIBLE. I have never eaten such filth in my life. I literally did not finish my food that I payed for. The lighting was also cheap and too low."}
{"text":"Had good experiences with Zipps in other locations.  This time, however, the service was mediocre at best.  The waitress had an attitude starting with her greeting. Her behavior suggested we were an inconvenience to her. Perhaps she had a bad night (happens to the best/worst  of us), perhaps she had plans and got stuck closing the shop . . . Should we have to wonder or should we be able to go out to eat and relax after work without an attitude from the staff? It's burger and fries people . . . a smile or just being pleasant is all we ask.  That said, the food was great as usual and there was one person (maybe the cook) who we encountered (1 of 4) who had a good attitude!!!!"}
{"text":"Salsa/quac w/ chips spicy but good! TVS all around - friendly staff much better experience than the first time I visited the place. Would come back based on this experience. We did salads they were okay cpl things could've been different but the fact is they weren't bad! Just a nice experience overall today!"}
{"text":"What happened food is normally good
Both our meals were less than satisfactory, hard to screw up bar food but they managed. I also don't get the 32 oz happy hour beer, I guess if you like warm beer it is cheap. Service was good, probably will not go back"}
{"text":"Food is bad but the ambience is good
Large place with enough people to make it seem lively
The beer was cold and the service adequate
The food tasted like it had been under a warming light and then dumped in the fryer to serve it. The result was the food did not stay hot long and ended being very dry. I love french fries and they ended up be tough to eat. They did look nice
We will go back just won't eat a meal"}
{"text":"The monaco focaccia is the most amazing thing to exist. The mozzarella sticks are also amazing, they come in egg rolls which is a fun surprise!! Highly recommend this establishment"}
{"text":"Zipps, always fun and good food.    Had the Saturday burger special for $6.50.     Quite tasty and good company.   Great lunch for under $20.    Can't beat it.    Free rides to events and all the tv's to watch any game.    Great for the kids and the lovers of Golden Tee too.   Zipparitas are hard to beat."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday afternoon meal with the fam. We ordered wings, which were okay. Cheesesteak was had, burgers were had, grilled chicken was had. Basically, the food was jut average bar food. Same as one would expect at a joint. But this is not a joint. This is on Mill, it is large and new and we all expected more. The waitress was nice enough but not very present. The company was good, which made up for the food, but having been to Zipps Camelback and Zipps over by Shea I think I would recommend you go to one of those instead. 

That being said, according to our ASU lunch guests, this place is packed end to end with coeds most night of the week so it will probably outlive you and I both, Longer or shorter depending on your age. Just don't expect fine dining or even a reasonable bill. No one got ill, so that's something.  

Oh, and parking is a B-."}
{"text":"So my co-worker and I decided to give Zipps a second chance.  We went a week ago.  It was the complete opposite than our first time.  There were only a few patrons.  We sat inside and was waited on in a few minutes. I ordered the tuna melt and had the fries. My co-worker had the chicken sandwich and sweet potato chips. The chips were good. I hope to go again and have a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Have started coming here since it's located near Hamilton HS and we are now attending the games for kids' activities. Great to have a place to get a quick bite and enjoy a beer after a late night. Good selection of draft beers and the menu options are typical bar faire. Buffalo style wings are a bit different than other places but not in a bad way. I would steer you clear of the fries though - they are a soggy, greasy mess.

Lots of TV's and sports playing. Plenty big with separate bar, dining area and outdoor patio. I have seen it very busy though and imagine it will be after varsity games. 

Staff has been very friendly, including the manager.

All-in-all one to add to my repertoire and a place we can enjoy after games with the family."}
{"text":"Love Zipps. Great service and it's always Happy Hour. Sports bar good for adults and kids too. Perfect."}
{"text":"Zipps is easily one of my go-to spots for beer and food. If me and my friends are looking to go out, especially for happy hour and can't decide where to go, Zipps is the default. My favorite thing about this place is their nightly specials for late night happy hour which is almost exclusive what we do. They also have a lot of great food; tho something to keep in mind; I don't think they are trying to be a fancy restaurant, but rather focuses on more \"bar food.\" With that in mind, their signature is the focassias, but I love the chicken strips and even their fish tacos! They don't have the biggest beer selection, but that's ok because what they do have is good, or just order a zipp-erita."}
{"text":"I just had one of the worst experiences ever at this place tonight all thanks to the GM Damon! I have never been talked down to or treated like trash in my life, especially as a paying customer, until this evening all thank to the GM Damon. First, the GM Damon scolded my husband, myself and our 10+ friends like unruly children for asking if we could have the misters on outside in 90 degree weather. Then the GM proceeded to joke loudly with patrons across the patio about the amount of bleach that needs to be used to clean lately because of all the blood (referring to the recent shooting that occurred here)! When I went to the front counter to grab a business card I saw him and asked what his name was to which he rudely responded \"Damon. Want me to give you the number to Corporate.\" A manager should know how to talk to people and solve an issue so that patrons come back, not challenge them to call corporate. I don't know what this guys power trip was but clearly there is a reason he is the closing manager on a Sunday night. Perhaps Zipps should look into the type of people it calls \"managers\" and provide them with proper training. We have been coming here since this place opened and lately it has really gone down hill. Very, very disappointing."}
{"text":"Friendly place with absurdly greasy food.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  Sometimes you want to watch a game and eat something that was drowned in cooking oil and then covered in ranch/bleu cheese.  If you're in that kind of mood, I've got your place!

The wings were really good and meaty while the fries were a little soggy.  The beers are reasonably priced and the large is enormous (32 oz).  Make sure to get a brownie for dessert.  They're really quite good."}
{"text":"Awful Manger and communication skills with handling missing food!!!!!!. We had a table of 7... not a large party at around 1230. There not more than 9 tables with 6 waitresses... for some reason four of the members of my party received there food and then three of the others had to wait 12 MINUTES before the other three received their lunches... Not only did the waitress only came by and say \"oh well many times we split tables up\" and \"will be out shortly\" we never heard I'm sorry, or \" let me get my Manger\" until the food actually came out... then he wanted to comp us a free dessert... well it's a memeber birthday and we have cake at home. So could we please do the birthday's meal free? \"Unfortunately out of 13 restaurants we cannot comp good only desserts\".. AS A MANGER YOU HAVE FULL CONTROL TO PLEASE THE CUSTOMERS!!!! Three of us have worked within the industry and we all know damn well we can have our mangers please the customer  to rensure their happiness and business.  THIS IS ACCEPTABLE! The food was amazing unfortunately amazing food doesn't make me feel welcomed and happy to go back. Visiting friends here who come often to this establishment, as of this experience, neither of our group memeber of 7 will be returing. The waitress and Manger both need to revisit their trainings on how to provide services and making their mistakes accountabile."}
{"text":"Chili dog with sauerkraut was great. It's a Wednesday special for $5, they do not skip out on the toppings. The beer comes in a 32oz option, domestics are $6 on Wednesday's as well. Pizza slices are only $2. The pizza was pretty good, depends on how you like it. The crust was very crunchy, just how I like. Great service, the server was super sweet, attentive, and informative. We came in late and still had great service. I recommend this place for a good time, with good bar food. They have shuffle board, golden tee and one other game."}
{"text":"i decided to give this place another try after the first time didn't work out to well. we waited 45 mins for the food and all the server could say was that it was coming. the manager never took the time to come over to apologize about the wait or even offer us anything. it was extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"I went to this bar while on a college tour with my daughter on Thursday and it was nice so we decided to return but when we did we had a totally different experience. Our server was a young lady who totally screwed up our order. We ordered Nachos but we're brought out chips and salsa and when we informed her the waitress that she had order wrong she got upset with us and tried to convince us we ordered chips and salsa instead. We then refused the chips and then she informed us that we order both chips and salsa and Nachos which makes no sense. She was upset and stormed away, we then was waiting on our complete order which was Nachos, and two order of wings. It took a very long time for order to come out so we told a waitress to please cancel our order then we begin to leave. While walking out with my daughter still hungry three guys literally ran out as soon as we stepped out of the restaurant and told us that we didn't pay for our order and tried to make me Pat for something we never received and was rude in front of my daughter. I then begin to get pissed and told the 3 guys that not only was we not going to pay for a meal that we never received, we were not ever going to revisit because of bad service. One of the guys two of the guys then said we order chips and salsa and didn't pay for it as well, the same chips and salsa we sent back the guys brought back up and said that we ordered them and we know it, in a very rude way and all in front of my daughter who's a minor. I tinformed the guys that we did not order the chips nor did we receive our food and we cancelled the order well before it came out and by the way they knew the order have not came out because as they were trying to intimidate me into paying for an order we didn't receive they told me that the order was almost ready and I need to pay. Now not only did I cancel because order still was not out bug the 3 guys still hadn't brought out an order that was ready even to try to satisfy us but instead carried on about me paying for something they knew we didn't receive and was still not prepared. I told them I'm not paying and to tone down their voices in front of my daughter, then one of the guys begin to go back and forth with me about me not canceling the order and I should pay and remember the food still was not out. It was when one of the guys said he understood after all the arguing right out in front of the establishment. After all of the confusion and just as we were walking off one of the guys stated that j needed to pay because I didn't cancel the order and begin again to raise his voice and that's when I raised mine and stated again I wasn't paying and he needed to watch his tone in front of my daughter who witnessed this madness.
In all we didn't receive our food and we were harassed about paying for food we never received and our waitress lied on us stating we never canceled even know that food had never came out and it was everest told it was ready. They are terrible with their service and try to make you pay even when you cancel and never receive your food. I would not recommend this place but it's a business and I to am a business owner so I suggest that you experience for your self and judge because that was my experience which j felt we were also targeted. The most rude out of the three guys was the black guy, and the other two were white so I think the black guy had something to prove by being extra rude even after the other two had apologized for the problem."}
{"text":"Sat down at 10:50, got my drinks and then was told at 11 I had to leave because we weren't 21. Such a dumb rule, since we were there to eat on the dining side. Lost our respect and we won't return. I'll gladly go to native from now on."}
{"text":"This is my third time to Zipps, second visit to this location.  It is hopping.  NBA Finals today -- it's LOUD (certainly there must be a movie playing around here somewhere cuz its like booming Dolby surround sound) and the place is packed.  Really though, good food, good selection, good prices, and good cocktails, no surprise this place is busy. Being a fan of Margarita rocks I have to tell you their Zipparitas really are something special.
I also like their Buffalo Wings.  Their hot is the perfect level of hot for me too.  Not wimpy and not the acid burning stuff either.   And can't forget to mention that their wings are meaty too.  Gawd I hate paying outrageous prices for wings that look like they came from anorexic hens.  Sheesh!  
So we arrived during unhappy hour and got a few minutes to enjoy a Zipparita while deciding on our dinner options.
Hmmm, what sounds good tonight?"}
{"text":"We just got done working out at lifetime and my husband and daughter had protein shakes from one stop. We all planned on eating it was just a recovery workout shake and the manager said we couldn't bring in outside drinks? We got up and left. So they lost out on a party of 4 bill over a recovery shake.... Pei Wei didn't mind!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place! Their food is delicious, the service is great, the atmosphere is awesome, and the drinks are thirst quenching!

A few of my favorites include (but are not limited to) Chicken Skewers, any & all of their focaccias (the Monaco being my personal fave), Zipparitas, and DO NOT get me started on their onion rings.  i could seriously eat a basket (or 2 or 10) of these onion rings with a side of sweet jalapeño dressing for dipping.

Only one complaint Zipps, you have no Tucson location! :'("}
{"text":"I am surprised about some of the negative reviews. Zipps was a staple in my life for a short while. It is a typical type of sports bar, but with a Scottsdale type of attitude (if that makes sense)

They have some golden hot wings that are delicious. Bigger wings that have a lot of chicken that has a great taste. I once had their Hot hot wings. I highly recommend NOT trying them because I pretty much cried. No joke. To be completely honest, two of my friends were eating them as well and it looked like they were eating mild, so, it was probably just me.

Their beer sizes are nice. 32 ounces for a decent price. Good bang for the buck!"}
{"text":"I am not understanding the word, \"amazing\" for ZIPS!  Terrible food, frozen hamburger patties.  The service was slow and just poor all the way around.  If you want a beer and sit and watch sports then go for it.  If you want good food, I would have had better food at McDonalds."}
{"text":"I come often. I drink,  order food and tip well. But at least 1 out of 4 times I go i receive aweful service. They are reluctant to fix their mistakes and really won't do anything to help an unfriendly guest Unless they complain enough. We waited over 30 minutes for a burger and even then our server never visited our table.

Long story short, this can be a cool place when they are working hard but too often enough their service is deplorable. Check it out at your own risk."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go watch any sport event! Burgers are great and beer is nice n cold!"}
{"text":"Zipps Sports Grill is a solid spot to head to for Happy Hour or to check out a game on the weekend. It's super casual, and the prices can't be beat. They have a killer happy hour special, $6.00 for 10 of their famous wings, or you can get an order of their skewers $3.00 well cocktails, or zipperitas, and $4.00 32oz domestic beers or premium pints!

It's no secret that I am a total wing junkie. I think I may be in need of a support group. If wings are on the menu then wings will be what I order. One would assume that something as simple as Chicken Wings would be hard to screw up. That is not true my friends... Who wants over cooked, over sauced, soggy chicken wings? Not me! The wings were perfectly crispy, deep fried to perfection and the sauce to wing ratio was spot on. And for $6.00 who can complain. The only thing that slightly bothered me was they charged me $0.50 for a side of ranch, I hate when places do that. Other than that, service was adequate, food was good, and for the price you can't beat it. Perfect laid-back  HH evening"}
{"text":"I am a chicken wing nut and Zipps has some pretty good chicken wings! It's my go-to joint after work on occasion when I am looking for some horribly greasy bar food and a stiff cocktail (aka zipperita!) Service has always been adequate so I can't complain."}
{"text":"I come here all the time with my friends and it is always awesome! The food is delicious, and the happy hour prices are awesome. Blayne was our server and she was super sweet and friendly. She even gave me a lid for my ranch to take home so it doesn't spill all over my car like usual! Yay zipps!"}
{"text":"Nice outdoor space with a fire pit. Ordered the chicken wings, crispy, and hot. It took a while but it was crispy and flavor was on point. Compared to other buffalo wings I've had,  it's not as saucy but the flavor was there it had a good burn in the back end. The fries shared with my friends was good too!"}
{"text":"The owners and CLEARLY whoever designed this space are DEAF.  It's a big brick box with nothing but hard surfaces that bounce the sound everywhere.  The food is good and the service is good, but you can't hear the people sitting across from you at your table.  
I like a good lively atmosphere and I love a good sports bar, but this place is very poorly designed.  All they need to do is add some acoustic tiles and batting on the ceiling and the whole atmosphere would improve.  
I live close to this location and think the food is good, but will not go back because it is just TOO LOUD."}
{"text":"We visited Zipps for dinner last night, a party of 11. We arrived at 9pm, promptly placed our proper as we were starving. Our server Sam was very personable and seemed on top of our drinks. At 10pm I asked about our food as we had not received a single item, not even an appetizer (of several placed). At about 10:15 our food starting trickling in, and did so for about another 15-20 minutes. Not everything was right, but it was yummy. A woman- Briana (the manager on shift) came over to bring a basket of fries and was so rude. She did not make eye contact with anyone, she did not say a word to us about why it had taken 90 minutes to get our food, nothing. Her words were \" basket of fries,\" and when I asked if they were the frings, she rudely snapped \"FRIES.\" We were not compensated for our leas then favorable experience, which is fine- we ultimately got our food and ate it all... but the lack of customer service from the manager Briana was unacceptable. A while later, the adults (4 of us) stayed behind and sat in the high tops to have a drink. When our server was over in the dining room cleaning, and clearly busy, one of us walked over to the bar- that Briana was tending- and asked if we could get a drink, she said \"I can't help you- YOU need to go call your server.\" Wow.  It is safe to say that we will not be visiting here again, which is unfortunate considering that we have been loyal patrons of this establishment for 7+ years :("}
{"text":"Just left the restaurant after coming to enjoy dinner as a family. My husband ordered wings, which 30 minutes later, still hasn't arrived. The rest of us at the table had finished our food before the waitress even came to check on us. She was surprised to find out that his food hadn't arrived... I couldn't believe it. She was counting on the food runners to do her job and she had nothing to say. Turns out they gave his food to the table behind us, which they selfishly accepted. 15 minutes later, the manager came over to apologize and said his meal would be comped (as it should be) but it took another 10 or so minutes for them to bring his food. When they did, my husband asked for an extra side of ranch, which, after all that, they charged us $0.50 for. Such a disappointment; needless to say I will not be coming back and I hope they get their customer service act together soon before they lose more customers."}
{"text":"came here with a friend to watch football.
We played some of the games also, shuffleboard, darts and pool. 
the shuffleboard isn't in the best condition. The roof was also leaking because of the rain and pointed it out to a manager and almost felt like we bothered them or like we were being a pain. it made the floor crazy slippery, you would have thought they would have been saying thanks for pointing that out so somebody doesn't slip and sue us.
anyways onto the food.
I ordered the zipps wings golden style and they were as good as my friend said.
I would definitely order them again. also got a zipperita and was good also."}
{"text":"We just moved into the Awhatukee/Chandler area and was looking for a fun sports bar to go to. 
This place has great food and a ton of screens to watch the games.  Service was good. They have HUGE sandwiches and excellent wings!!!"}
{"text":"Hi Zipps. I am a PB&J burger contasouer.  I had the Peanut Butter Burger today an it sucked. You need to step up your game on the PB&J burger. Seriously, it's a burger with peanut butter and bacon, with a side of jelly...you know the plastic thing with jelly that you get with toast. I love me a PB&J burger, but this sucked. Burger was dry, bun was crumbly and the frys were room temp. Giving 2 stars because the bartender was cool."}
{"text":"SSSSSLLLLLOOOOWWW service...talk about bad service. We were seated right away and then waited 10 minutes for someone to come to our table to take our drink order. Our drinks took 10 min to make -  2 simple drinks...slow!  Our server seemed very confused in general. We ordered food which took about 15 min. Food was ok. We finished our food and drinks and the waitress took a while to come back to our table (about 15 minutes more). We asked for 2 more of the drinks...15 minutes later and still no drinks. We had to get up and walk to find our waitress to get our bill... got tired of waiting. All she said was \"sorry I didn't come back to your table faster.\" It was obvious that she completely forgot the drinks. Won't be going back to this place. It wasn't that crowded and we shouldn't wait that long for service."}
{"text":"It's hard to respect this place as a sports bar when they play annoying music instead of the sound of a game. I get many games are on at the same time, but I'd rather hear the sounds of ANY game than the noise on their speakers. I come back for golden medium wings, which my boyfriend insists on getting extra crispy, which then require extra sauce. My experience with the service here has always been fine, except any time I request that the so-called sports bar play the sound of a sporting event. No one comes here for a dance party."}
{"text":"Dec 28th, 2017: This place is cool but the staff is ridiculous and disgusting. The reason I am saying that is because of the waiter (Server Name per receipt: 271 Olivia E) first she (I am sure purposely) forgot to bring the take away box that I asked for and then when I asked for the bag she is chatting with the bartender and pointing out towards me which I fortunately noticed. So, as we were about to leave and even though she noticed me that I did look at her she didn't bring the bag I asked for. So, I am writing this review on yelp about this place and would like to let everyone know that this place is full of immature kids (ASU or immature kids!!) who works there. I can't give negative stars but if I could I would have for sure."}
{"text":"This place has a sit yourself sign in the front.
Sat down for about 15 mins, then a guy(seemed like a busboy) comes over to ask what we would like to drink. 

After few mins, the guy comes back with drinks and asked if we were ready to order. 
Everything seems normal...EXCEPT we had never got our menus. hahaha... 

Then we got another server Brianna I believe. She was very sweet and helpful! 
Food came out perfectly as we ordered. 

Except for the sit yourself no menu issue, I had good food and great service!"}
{"text":"Do not waste precious calories here! It's AWFUL bar food. We waited over 30 minutes for our food, but the table behind us got their food first when they had just been seated. The wings were nasty and tasted like they had been microwaved. They were dry with hardly any sauce and all the food was fried too long. The service was nice and I liked how they had 2 pool tables. Other than that it was a waste of money. It's expensive for what you get. I didn't even finish my food because it gagged me. My husband ate it all because he hates throwing food away. What a shame."}
{"text":"It is always a great time at this Zipps location! Very consistent with each food order! They make you feel welcome and never rush you. The golden hot wings are the best!"}
{"text":"We came to this Zipps because we were told that they do a shuttle to the Angels games. We called earlier that week and were told that they were still doing it. When we went to buy our vouchers, The server even thought that they still did it. We then had the manager come over and say they don't do the shuttle anymore and that they would give us a coupon code for an Uber. The code did not work. The service and food was fine. Not happy about shuttle but ended up getting to game on our own."}
{"text":"Matt is the worst general manager i have ever encountered!!! We were in a few weeks ago and the server lost our CASH BILL and Matt made us pay it AGAIN! He told us he would call the cops on us for \"theft\" if we didn't pay again! We tried to call corporate numerous times and never recieved a phone call or email back. Go to other Zipps and avoid this one!!"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the zipparitas and wings we wouldn't come here anymore... Service is absolutely terrible!"}
{"text":"Love Zipps for beer and wings. Always cold beer and the hot buffalo wings are pretty good."}
{"text":"Awful awful service. The waitress is a bitch, appetizer has taken an hour and counting. The thing is i love the food here, but the service has been horrible each and every time ive come here. Never have i ever experienced worst service consistently in my life."}
{"text":"The good: bartenders, \"ziparitas\", certain food items.

The average: most of the food (let's be honest though, what do you expect out of bar food?), the wait service, tap beer selection.

The bad: management: god forbid you have one drink too many here, bar area can get crowded, just has an \"up tight\" feel at times."}
{"text":"A group of us decided to meet up and hang out for St. Patrick's Day and Zipps was a convenient place for all of us to go.  It was surprisingly slow for the day but it worked out well for us because that meant lots of tables open for the 10 of us.  However the other usual perk of a slow restaurant, fast service, did not happen.  At all.

Most of our group had showed up early and gotten a big table and ordered already so when I showed up with one other friend there wasn't much the waitress needed to do.  She got our drink orders right away and came back a few minutes later to get our food orders.  I ordered a cup of chili and my friend ordered a Chicken Caesar salad, neither of which are items that take a particularly long time to put together.  However after about 20 minutes the waitress came back, not with the food, but to ask what I wanted on top of my chili again.  It had appeared as though she wrote it down when I ordered it the 20 minutes prior but apparently looks can be deceiving.  Then it took another 5 minutes for my chili to make it's grand entrance and another 5 minutes after THAT for my friend's salad to arrive.  Now again, this place was not busy at all!  It should not take 25 minutes to scoop some chili out of a pot where it sits all day and put it into a bowl and bring it to a table.

To make matters worse, not only was our server slow, but every time she came around and we asked for something she acted as though we were bothering her.  It honestly was kind of a buzz kill and our table ended up talking about how poor the service was rather than enjoying a fun St. Patrick's Day."}
{"text":"Gives  other Zipps bad name. Don't  know if we weren't  in servers zone but we were treated like we weren't.  Had to aak for silverware and napkins half way through  service. Brought wrong drink and charged us the higher price. Didn't  eat more then half of my meal. Food was dive bar type  but worse."}
{"text":"I like to refer to this Zipp's location as the \"fun Zipp's\". Located in uptown Phoenix, this neighborhood is the up and coming, young professional neighborhood! These people party hard during happy hour, but make sure they're in bed at a reasonable time to get their 8 hours before work the next day! Zipps is known for their wings and burgers and CHEAP 32oz drafts! On any given night you can find one or more of these items on special! Per usual, this location is LOADED with high def flat screen tvs, a shuffleboard table, pool table, Golden Tee machine, and patio complete with a fire pit to huddle around on those cold winter nights (yes that was a joke)!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour monster icy cold mugs full of tasty beer.   Great price for good buzz!!!  Good wings and great service"}
{"text":"We ate at Zipps Sports Grill for the very first time, and we all we disappointed at the service and the food.  The waitress was not attentive, we waited 15 minutes to have her place our order.  They serve you wet plastic baskets with parchment paper setting inside and paper is all wet, unsanitary in the fact that our food will be setting in it.  The french fries were sopping in grease and were over done.  The onion rings were chewy and tough, almost as if they were deep fried a second time.  The salad came right out of  a bag, just lettuce and shredded carrots, not very appealing. There is a lot of competition out there and if they don't change a few things they will not last very long."}
{"text":"We came to Zipps because we know the burgers are like those at Goldie's - absolutely yum - and much closer (even though it's still a trek of a drive from home). The first time my hubby and visited was also the first time to try their golden wings. Can we say \"best wings ever\"? At least they are IMO. I do not, however, like their fries. Soggy blahness. Onion rings - good. 

The second time we visited was on hubby's birthday. The parking lot was packed and we were in doubt that we'd get a table quickly. But to our surprise there were still a few open tables. This time I had the pepper jack focaccia (chicken, bacon, avocado, pepper jack, garlic mayo). It was sooooo cheesey and delicious. It also came with a side of some sweet jalapeno sauce. It was good, but a bit too sweet. Our friend had the chicken fingers which he was a bit disappointed with. They were battered with that smooth type of batter (I don't know what it's called) and were not very crispy at all. Our entree orders took sooo long that he was able to (after trying our golden wings) switch from regular buffalo to the golden stuff. Friend casually mentioned that it was husband's birthday in front of our waitress and she exclaimed \"oh! Then you get a free desert or shot!\" He couldn't decide on a shot, so told her to surprise him. She brought him a chocolate cake shot. How fitting! 

The Chambord Zipparitas get 5 stars all on their own. These things are delicious! Small blended margaritas for only $3 during happy hour! And boy do they pack a punch! I guess that's why there is a limit of 3? Hahah. Other HH drink/food specials are awesome as well!

I hate that this is the closest Zipps to my 67th Ave/Happy Valley home, but on the other hand, that may be a good thing for my health and wallet."}
{"text":"We visit this Zipps location regularly as we live just down the street from here. There's plenty of parking spaces available. I'd say the wings here are simply the best wings around, made to perfection. I also recommend the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream, it's delicious! 

We usually sit at the bar. Definitely need to mention our favorite bartender there, Webber , who always delivers great customer service."}
{"text":"I ordered the Swiss Mushroom Burger but since I am very particular about how my beef is cooked I asked if it could be  medium rare and she said no problem. I dont like my beef over done. If it couldnt be cooked med rare I would have ordered something else but since that was no problem I went for it.    The burger came and it was very  well done.  While everyone else at my table ate I looked around for my server to tell her.  Finally the manager noticed I was looking around and came over to see if I needed anything.  I explained that the burger was too well done.  He asked me if I wanted another one.  By this time everyone else at the table was finishing up with their food so I said no. I had already waited for so long that I didn't want another one any more.  The bill came and they charged me for the burger that I didnt eat because THEY OVER COOKED IT.   The manager was surprised that I didnt want to pay for the over cooked food.  He said that the policy was that if they didn't take the food off the table then they don't take it off the bill.  If that is the policy why didnt he take it off the table? It was not how I wanted it. It was dry and unedible ad far as I was concerned.
The server was nice, the manager was rude and unprofessional.  I would never go back to this place.  Everyone else at the table said the food was not good. The onion rings were dripping with grease.   The place was very noisy and the bathroom was filthy.  Dont waste your time."}
{"text":"1) Onion rings was so pathetic that the stale batter could hardly hold on to the onion.
2) Nachos were so tasteless that some dog poop with some cheese would taste better..
3) french fries looked wrinkled like a 75 year old man and tasted like stale mess of oil 
4) first time after I came to the US, i found a place that managed to screw up a bloody mary cocktail which was just tomato juice and water.

ZIPPS is the WORST PLACE ON MILL.... ALL THE BEST IF YOU GO THERE."}
{"text":"Poor customer service! Attempted to watch USA World Cup game with a party of six. Host and manager acted like it was their first time working a large event. Given it was a big match no additional staff was scheduled. We asked several times where we were at on list. She responded you are next. A majority of others guests were seated which where larger parties than us. Finally after waiting almost two hours we left. I notified host we were leaving and she replied, \"okay thanks\". Unfortunate, hope you get your act together for football season. Poor customer service from host to manager on duty!"}
{"text":"Stopped off here for lunch after a golf tournament. The restaurant at the golf course didn't have any servers, so here we are. I ordered the BLT on sour dough with onion rings.
The bacon was over cooked, like eating aged  brittle. The onion rings had no flavor. The batter was tasteless and no crunch. They need to try Portillo's onion rings, the best.
Our server was great, checking on us to see if we were doing okay.
The venue was quiet for a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"Zips bar and grill is ridiculous we went there for my girlfriend's birthday and they would not accommodate a friends food allergy that is outrageous and just poor customer service from the manager saying she could have a salad never going back again!!!"}
{"text":"Cold fries, slow service. Not my favorite place."}
{"text":"Zipps serves its purpose. It's a sports bar.  Lots of tvs, great beer specials, and good food. It is 5 star dining?  No. But their food is MUCH better than your average sports bar. Good wings, great sandwiches actually.  It's my go to for games and such. YOu also can't beat the Camelback location and their bus that takes you to Salt River Fields for free!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience yesterday!  We went specifically to watch the Arizona Rattlers win the Arena Bowl and had to beg and plead for them to put the game on. After finally convincing them to put the game on in order for us to get sound to the game we had to ask other fans there to request the same thing, since they told us we weren't enough of a majority to make it worth their while.  When we arrived we were one of only a few tables there....seemed that they would have rather played 80's rock music instead of supporting one of our Arizona teams.  The manager Brian was extremely rude and refused to accommodate us.  The service was mediocre and the food was the same.  We only went there to watch the game...we called ahead and stopped in a couple days prior to be sure they would be playing it, but it seemed to be such an inconvenience once we arrived.  Will never be back to that location for sure."}
{"text":"Just a comment on how you can improve service. NOTIFY guests of your sharing and split fee when the order is placed, in advance, instead of relying on them reading the fine print. Perhaps I wouldn't have been barred from all Zipps restaurants and the manager wouldn't have had a cow when I asked questions about it. I've paid the charges at other restaurants after the server made me aware in advance and gave me the choice of splitting, sharing, or not. Make sure your servers are consistent in knowing what to charge, ie extra shot in Zipparitas. Ztejas servers are quite good at it. Great service shouldn't change because of new management and servers. You guys used to be awesome. Too bad for you for your loss of a really fabulous customer (me) who brought lots of business and tips your way. C'est la vie."}
{"text":"Any review under 5 stars is a lie. Great specials. Medium golden wings with a side of fries cannot be beat. Nice staff. Lots of sports on TVs. Love it. 

Told my wife we could go anywhere for our third wedding anniversary (awhile ago now); she chose this Zipp's. I would marry her all over again."}
{"text":"Went here to watch the NFL season opener, it was packed in there! However, service was fairly quick and the server paid close attention to us. The food is always good here and if you go during happy hour they have 32oz domestic drafts!"}
{"text":"Here for lunch... I'm sad to give it 3 stars because the service and everything was great, but their food is just not that good. We come here every now and then but I think this is the last time :(  Between the 3 of us we got a burger, fish tacos, and a chicken burrito. While none of it was awful, nothing was delicious either. It's not terribly expensive but for the price I think it should taste better."}
{"text":"I frequent this location the most, but during softball/kickball season we are at Camelback location more often. Both rate about the same in my book as far as service and food is concerned.

We always get the veggie burger which comes with fries or onion rings for only $5.95. The veggie burger is always good, for a non veggie restaurant(sports bar at that) it's damn good. They usually have decent beer specials and some games on as well.

 Sometimes the crowd at this location is strange, I can't figure it out. Mix of douche-bags, Scottsdale moms and kids - def too many kids. Camelback location has a better crowd and patio by far.

This location is 3 stars for me but it gets four because it is a sports bar with a fine veggie burger for less then $6."}
{"text":"I don't like the name \"Zipps\" for starters. I mean what that even mean?! Because the service sure wasn't zippy! We waited 35 minutes before someone even came to our table to ask for drinks. Granted this was the \"quiet\" time. I ordered a simple cheeseburger and my children ordered chicken nuggets. Hard to mess up right? WRONG! My children's chicken nuggets were almost burnt on the bottom, and my burger was pink inside... salmonella, I think yes. Anyways, my server even seemed high at the time. I suspect he was \"hitting the joint\" in the back. Skunky smells(weed) you BETCHA! Overall, wouldn't recommend... AT ALL!"}
{"text":"Went with family for a night out with our grandson. Atmosphere was excellent! Plenty of tv's all over. Paris was our server and she was excellent! The wings were very tasty along with the hugeass glass of ipa! Recommend to anyone near chandler"}
{"text":"not really a fan of chains, but this one does everything right. the food is a steal at their prices, then add in that there is literally only 1 hour a day where there isn't something on special. some of the best wings in central phoenix and their Extra Hot sauce is actually hot, yet still flavorful. 

only problem? this is a rough place on sundays during the nfl season, it gets INSANELY busy. but for monday night/ college football, its usually not that bad. other sports barely cause a blip unless the suns/ dbacks/ coyotes/ asu are playing in a REALLY big-deal game."}
{"text":"I live in San Diego, so only get to Zipps every so often when I'm in AZ visiting my bf.

The food is pretty standard bar/pub good. I've had their burgers, I've had their pizza, chicken fingers, chicken rolls - all of it decent, but not exciting or exceptionally good. BUUUT, Zipps earns their rating because they have THE best wings in the whole wide world!! ZIPPS GOLDEN WINGS are to die for!!  The perfect balance of crispy and juicy - and the \"Golden\" sauce, is liquid crack!!

I can't compare this Chandler location to any other Zipps locations because I've never been to any of their other locations.  I've been here a couple times during football season, Sunday night or Monday night games, usually packed. Lots of TVs, solid football watching venue.  The bar is full of TVs, too and has a shuffle board and pool table.  Always been a good, casual, and fun atmosphere every time I've gone.

I was just at Zipps this past weekend, and I miss those wings already!!"}
{"text":"We have never had worse service in this area ever! We went during happy hour and waited 30 mins for every drink, had to order each drink  2x because our waitress forgot and at the end of the meal were told we could not split the tab. We were not told this at the beginning of our party of 12 people!! Your manager Josh did nothing to assist and did not care we were inconvenienced due to the fact we ALL had to pay $5 extra at an atm each to pay in cash. We were told this was your policy as stated on the menu, we did not order from the main menu! We ordered from the happy hour menu which did not state this. Our server was sooo rude one of our coworkers left! Please know our company gatherings will be taken to a better organized establishment in the future. I'd rather go to buffalo wild wings as at least I know their service is amazing. For an upscale part of town your service is terrible."}
{"text":"First time visit has quickly turned into the LAST time.

We were told a 5-10 minute wait to start... and waited 20+ just to be seated. While the waitress was nice enough to come get us out drinks, she was scarce after that. Didn't come back to check on us at any point between our order. 30+ minutes after having ordered our food and it's still not here. To top that, several people who came in AFTER us somehow got their food before?

We ordered a bacon cheeseburger and a BLT. That's it. Nothing fancy. There's certainly nothing remotely zippy about this place other than my exit. So totally disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and great service, I have no idea why this only has 3 stars. Best wings around! Great food and good prices."}
{"text":"Rainy  and amber are super sweet !Have awesome salads and wings it's got great home like feeling. Every time each persons is so nice to me and my daughter"}
{"text":"First time trying this Zipps location and the food was horrible. The chicken strips, fries, and onion rings were flavorless, and seemed to be fried in old oil or the oil wasn't hot enough. The chicken focaccia was dry, and the cheese for the pretzels was lumpy and just didn't taste good. Would definitely not recommend their food here."}
{"text":"There's nothing negative to say about any of the Zipps across the Phoenix area. Great food, big beers and lot's of sports! This location has a lot of room and the staff is always friendly. This is a frequent lunch spot for me these days."}
{"text":"Love the food. Love all the games on TV. Great prices. Pretty good happy hour and daily specials. Still wish there was a better tap selection.

But there's something that really irks me about this place; The hostess will never give an estimate for how long the wait is going to be. If you ask, she will tell you how many tables are waiting to be seated ahead of you. I understand that this is a sports bar and some people have the intention of staying there for several hours to watch a game (or two). But when any restaurant has been in business for as long as this place has, they should have enough of an idea of what their average turnover rate is on any given night so I can know if I am going to be waiting 5 minutes or 5 hours."}
{"text":"Good burgers.  Good beer selection.  A great happy hour that goes to 7.  What more do you need?

My only real issue with Zipps is that they don't have enough TV's for a sports bar.  Sure, you can see most of the big games, but if you're there on a Sunday to catch a random football game that not too many other people want to see, then you may be out of luck.  I also don't get the \"window\" tv screens between the bar and the dining room.  They're awesomely huge and sharp, but if you're on the bar side, everything is backwards.  It gets very awkward.

I love the burgers.  They're pretty cheap, cooked right, and served with a choice of wonderfully greasy onion rings, fries, sweet potato chips, half and half of any two, or a salad.  The focaccias are also also pretty good.  Just a heads up, they're not traditional focaccia.  It's more like a wrap with a pita made with a focaccia recipe.  It's a style that's unique to Zipps, and is actually pretty good, just a little shocking the first time you order it."}
{"text":"They have the absolute WORST onion rings I've ever tasted! The burger was pretty good, though!"}
{"text":"After visiting my neighborhood Zipps literally hundreds of times I'm finally leaving a review. I don't know what's happened to our favorite spot. I've had to send the food back 3 visits in a row. Other than swinging by for a drink on happy hour I think we may be done with the food here for a while. First trip, my fiancés chicken fingers were cremated, the breading was almost black, and my burger was also way overdone and dry. Second time, the fries were like soft wet noodles - normally I cut them some slack because their fries are never my favorite but they were totally inedible. And on trip 3, the chicken in my salad was cool and slimy in the middle, the most alarming of all 3 recent experiences. I mean, it's Zipps not Mastros, but serving even slightly undercooked chicken is dangerous. It saddens me because this is our favorite bar food spot and it just seems like the kitchen has fallen apart. I will say the staff is typically on point and accommodating despite my grievances, which is the only reason I can give it more than one star at the time being. I hope things turn around soon."}
{"text":"I went to Zipps last week for a dinner/happy hour.  I'm pretty sure this was the first time I've been to any of the Zipps, though I've known about them for years.  I liked the atmosphere, plenty of tv's all over the place, showing a nice variety of games.  I did not like the stools that were at the tables in the bar...seemed like the footrests were a little bit too low to be comfortable, at least for me.

The drink specials were great.  I had a 32 oz beer (of which there were several draft choices) for something like $3.25...what a deal!  Waitress service in the bar was attentive...initially.  A couple of people ordered some food and I told the waitress that I was still looking at the menu and that I'd order when she came back.  All of the sudden she disappeared, and I didn't see her again until she was serving the food to the other end of the table.  Just weird, since it seemed like every two minutes she was checking on our drinks and seeing if we wanted food initially.  

I ordered a Zipps burger.  For my side I got half & half.  I love the half & half option, so I don't have to make that oh so difficult choice between fries and onion rings and get the best of both worlds.  Everything I got was good, I wasn't blown away, probably the best food item was the onion rings, which definitely appeared to be something made onsite.

If I could give half stars, Zipps would get 3.5.  But I can't, I'm going to round down.  I may go here again, I may not.  I liked the cheap beer and abundant tv's...all I need to do is figure out how to get there during happy hour with a game on that I want to see and a driver and I'm golden!"}
{"text":"Food was just alright. The service was the worse that we have had in a long time but never at Zipps. Let me start with .... the cheese. So we have been to many Zipps and their fries are never good but we just make it work with cheese. The waitress brings back the nasty looking cheese that looks like grits. Lol. So I let her know that we have had cheese at another location that was like cheese whiz. She goes and says let me ask. Now first instead of coming back and saying like we don't offer it at this location that would have been a better response. She has the manager come over to say we don't offer that. The manager(old female) then says she has been at Zipps for 15 years. We have never had that. (TIME FOR RETIREMENT) I've been at few that do and some don't. All of that to say, her argumentative nature turned us off. I've been a manager for some years. The better way to say it would have been the way I stated above. Either way they did take off the cheese but now we were stuck with the nasty fries. 

Lastly check comes we leave 30 % usually. The waitress said do you need change but, tries to come back with no ones to get her tip higher. The frustrating part was I need the ones for me not you. So since she played that game she got less then our standard. To many games. Never going back to this particular location."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends from Chicago for the Blackhawks/Kings Game 4.  This place has one of the best happy hour/nightly specials of any sports bar in the Valley.  Between the four of us, we must have consumed at least five basket of wings, one giant plate of nachos, sandwiches/burgers for each of us and at least 3 drinks a piece, and the final split only came to $23 per person.  The medium wings were absolutely delicious and the nachos were more than filling.  Lots of flat screen TVs that showed multiple games so I was able to watch both the Kings game as well as the cHeat/Pacers game.

What really impressed me  about this place was our server, Connor.  The entire place was packed, and Connor had multiple tables (including a table that had your typical stuck-up and entitled native Scottsdale folks), and he was completely attentive to our table despite how busy it got.  The guy took his time taking our orders in detail, came back frequently to see how we were doing and to see if we wanted anything else, and never missed a order from us.  Even when the aforementioned table of the typical entitled Scottsdale family (who also apparently thought bringing their entire extended family to a rowdy sports bar was a good idea) were completely mistreating the poor dude by getting in his face when he didn't move fast enough for them, our server did not allow dealing with these idiots to deter his level of service to the rest of his tables.  We were all very impressed with the level of service and made sure we left some nice tips to take care of him.

Reviews on here that say service was terrible, make sure you ask to get served by this guy next time."}
{"text":"The place looked really fun when we were driving by so we stopped in on the St. Patrick's Day but the service was super slow and it seemed like the staff was irritated with us when we ask questions in fact at first they tried to deny my service animal the right to come in after showing Proctor proper documentation with attitude they allowed him.  

We just ordered burgers and fries and it took over 35 minutes to get our food which we thought was kind of long for 3 o'clock in the afternoon

The turkey burger was pretty small but I guess it was only 7.50 but it just was a pretty small portion .

Our server Tiffany was cute and great with the diet coke refills but just not to friendly.  Maybe mad working on ST PATTYS DAY 

Was kind of random but there was a french fry in our salad I thought it was cool but my friend was pretty upset

I would give 3 to 4 stars if the staff is nicer and they didn't harass me on my dog I can deal with having to wait for food all in all together my experience was 1 to 2 stars at best"}
{"text":"Nothin' special- you can always find a seat.  Servers aren't particularly enthusiastic, but you get what you pay for. Happy hour margaritas are amazing (and strong!)"}
{"text":"Our experience is definitely NOT worthy of a single star but a refund on a forced miserable experience including the manager Ryan calling the police!!!  Having difficulty finding food after bowling last Friday we popped by the Bethany Home location minutes before midnight but as others have complained it took about 15 minutes to get noticed.  We finally did place our food order and the girls two wines...oops here's your wine but the kitchens closed.  WHAT?  Why'd you take our order and why would we stay for wine when last resort tasty Taco Bell next door?  Sorry, you pay!  Ummm, really...let's fix this with a manager.  Ryan demands we pay regardless to commonsense nor good business practice for a measly $12.49!  He offered up a $5 coupon that expired the next day.  The girls scoffed and ripped it up and no sooner awesome Ryan asked us to pay, leave or he'd call the cops.  We waited for the girls to finish and than the poor police came to deal with this silly situation... of which the police rolled their eyes that Zipps wasted their time to even call them. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"I moved to the area two years ago and discovered this place and loved it right off the bat.  However over that time things have really gone downhill especially at the Tempe location.  To start, the manager is problematic.  Here's the story - I'm from Back East and where I'm from only one condiment goes on wings and it is bleu cheese.  When I started going to Zipps they had the best in the area.  At some point they decided to replace it with ranch with crumbles on top.  Why?  Who knows but it's the case at every location.  So my colleagues and I went there for lunch one day about a year ago and I order the buffalo chicken salad and specified that I wanted bleu cheese on it.  It came drenched in ranch - my colleagues all tried it and agreed it was definitely not bleu cheese.  I asked the waitress to take it back and she gave us the impression that she had heard this complaint a number if times.  Then something happened I've never seen before - the manager brought me back the same dish, put it back in front of me and insisted it was bleu cheese.  I disagreed and he offered a solution to the dispute by saying \"I can bring you the container and you'll see it says bleu cheese.\"  I thought I had transported into the scene from Tommy Boy where he talks about slapping a guarantee on the box - it has to be your bull.

Look, if you want to replace your bleu cheese with inferior product just go ahead and do it, but don't lie to your customers when they call you out on your BS.  I'm not sure if there is some sort of bleu cheese shortage or Mr. Valentine from Trading Places is driving the cost up on the commodities market or something but it just makes you look like a fool when you try to tell your customers something like that.  

Another time we had a group of about 8 getting together to watch the ACC tournament - five of us got there earlier than the other 3 so we pushed two hi-tops together.  The manager came over and said he could not \"give up\" the table.  Bear in mind the one we grabbed was closest to the door and multiple groups had looked at it and walked out the door instead of sitting there but he could not afford to let us take such a money maker.  Also, we were clearly dressed professionally and were obviously ready to drop a siginficant amount of money watching 4 hours of hoops.  Anyway....he asked us when the other 3 were going to show and I said like 20 minutes.  He said he could \"give\" me 15, then came over after 5 and moved the table back while our collective jaws hit the floor.  When the next guy came, he sat alone at that table, ordered nothing but water and we proceeded to talk loudly between the tables to mock what was going on until the other two arrived and we were \"allowed\" to abscond with the table.  Our waitress was even laughing at how stupid the whole thing was. Except for what has become known amongst my friends as The Bleu Cheese Incident I've never seen such unprofessional behavior from someone in the service industry.

Too bad because for a sports bar the food is pretty good, the beers are always cold and its a convenient place to go before or after a movie at the AMC nearby.  In this day and age, however, service is everything and this place fails decidedly on that count."}
{"text":"Jason was our bartender on a Monday night. A few of us went in for a drink. He helped us out with what to order. 
We will definitely come back to this location because of him."}
{"text":"I have never been to Zipps before and will not go again. We were a group of four girls just wanted to have a couple drinks. We sat ourselves and the waitress came by pretty quickly. She took our drink order, then it all went bad.... She didn't write anything down. We ordered long island, bloody mary, water, and another long island. The waitress confirmed order by saying, 2 long islands, bud light and water. We of course said no and corrected the bud light to a bloody mary. She left and took a long time for the drinks to come back. The long island was cloudy, my \"long island\" was not a long island at all, it was some tea concoction that the bar apparently makes. I didn't like it, so I tried my friends \"long island\" and I didn't care for that one. Sitting there with no drink to drink we waited for a while until she came back and I said that my drink was not a long island as I ordered. She said it was some kind of tea. I said I ordered a long island so she asked if I would like a long island. I said, well that is was I ordered but the one I tasted was not good. So I ordered the most simple drink I could think of. I said \"absolute and cranberry\" After waiting again the drink arrived and I looked at it and knew it wasn't going to be good. I took a sip and I was right. The color was all wrong. I finally get her attention and regretfully have to tell her that this drink is no good. I asked if it was absolute and she said no it's house vodka. She claimed that I said vodka cranberry, I did not say vodka! I never order just vodka! Gross! She again asked if I wanted what I actually ordered. I said no because the cranberry juice tasted stale and I just was at a loss at that point. I ordered a whiskey sour and she didn't bring it, I assume it was the bartender that did. I tasted it and it was ok...so I drank it anyway and we left."}
{"text":"I thought the food was mediocre, and the beer list was even worse.  Burger was ok, pizza was terrible, but the fish sandwich was pretty good (though they charged me extra for the tartar sauce, which I thought was ridiculous)"}
{"text":"i'll divide this into 2 reviews.  
watching a game and hanging out:  good place.  good atmosphere, lots of tv's and big beers.  

from a food standpoint - and especially a vegetarian - awful.  now the reality is, i've not always been a vegetarian and the Monaco wrap thing is pretty good.  and i loved burgers, but even then, every time i got done, i always felt a bit sick to my stomach.  fries are really greasy. 

so to summarize, if you are looking for good food, go elsewhere.  if you want to hang out and watch a game - go.  

and to zipps - why not upgrade the menu a little?"}
{"text":"*Warning if you are under 50 you are unwelcome here, and they will automatically profile you as a dine and dasher. Not only was the service undesirable the food was bad. Never again!"}
{"text":"We parked ourselves here for about 7 hours watching the Final Four.  Our server, Heather, was fantastic.  It appeared that they were understaffed for the day, but the service remained great.  The wings were some of the best we've had.  Crispy outside and juicy inside.  Chicken fingers had a great batter. Nothing was greasy.  Chicken nachos were not my favorite but not bad. Nice place to watch the games."}
{"text":"I went to zipps a couple of nights ago to meet a friend for some drinks. We had ordered 2 zipperitas about 20 mins later our server said they were doing last call on drinks so we ordered a 2nd round of drinks. Then about 10 mins later the manager comes by & says he has to take our drinks away because they were closing. I asked our server if she could take the drinks off of the bill because we didn't touch the second round of drinks at all. The manager came by & said we had to pay for them because last call was done 10 minutes ago & he couldn't comp them. So I have to pay for something I didn't even drink? I work in the restaurant industry as well & I found the managers customer service to be so rude. My friend & I explained to the manager we literally didn't even touch our drinks. I was disappointed in the manager for not being understanding about the situation. Our server was more understanding than the manager, she kept apologizing & said we shouldn't of had to pay for them. 
I'm not one to complain & write reviews but this situation really bothered me & I didn't appreciate it."}
{"text":"I'm writing this in the restaurant because it has taken so long for my bill to get paid. I can't tell you how much I want to get out of here. After waiting for my bill and watching the waitress walk by multiple times,I have had time to angrily think about how much I hated my meal. The menu has Foccocias sandwich's listed... If you're expecting real foccocia bread, expect something that is completely opposite. The sandwiches are wrapped in raw thick pizza dough. I'm seriously wondering why they call it that. On another note, the fries were completely soggy, and also gross tasting. My husbands wrap came with this supposed Jalapeño sauce- it tasted like ice cream. On a positive note, the wings were decent and the manger came to see my displeased self and refunded my meal. The waitress got a nice tip for dealing with my dissatisfaction."}
{"text":"My husband and I just walked into this restaurant with a cup of coffee from a neighboring coffee shop. The first thing that was yelled to us from a waitress walking by was \"you cannot bring in that outside coffee.\" We turned around and walked right out. Apparently they would rather lose the $6.00 in drinks than earn $50 on the food we would have spent . Oh and THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE COFFEE other than Folgers instacrap. So they apparently don't want people drinking anything other than soda, boxed wine, and a crappy beer selection."}
{"text":"Came in here on a Tuesday afternoon in between meetings with clients. 

The Extra Hot Golden Wings were amazing! Not your typical buffalo wing flavor at all. Tangy, yet very spicy. Came out nice and crispy. 

It looked like Zipps had some great happy hour specials, so definitely will have to come back with friends one of these nights."}

{"text":"In at least one point in every ones life you will have the need to eat or want to have dinner at a ridiculously late time. I am in one of those phases. After late shifts of cocktail waitressing  I need dinner. Naturally I don't usually want to muster the energy to cook something delicious for myself. That either leaves going out to the few places that are open or ...fast food. Luckily I have found Zipp's which offers great cheap food until two am in a sports bar restaurant nice and close to where I live. 

Now had my mother of all people never informed me that Zipp's has a nice dining area, I would never have thought of going here. I thought it was a just a small dinky bar from the way it appears outside, but I was wrong!  Zipp's is pretty large inside offering dining areas, pool areas, bar, and patio. They also magically beat my sports bar stereotype and have awesome food and a very extensive menu. 

While there on Friday at around eleven after work it was very busy! But 
since most of those people were drunk we had no problem finding  a table in the dining section. I had a hard time choosing between all the American menu options so I just went with a mixture of chicken and beef tacos while my boyfriend ordered a hamburger. My Tacos were really good, but the thing that really surprised me was my boyfriends hamburger. I don't eat a lot of beef, especially burgers, but it was delicious! The meat was the most tender I have had at any 
restaurant , and something about it just tasted so fresh! We were both very shocked and impressed. Nice atmosphere and staff, but definitely a bar before a restaurant. On Friday, as to be expected, there were a lot of loud drunk people running around."}
{"text":"This was our second time eating at Zipps. We received a gift card. The first time was ok/good. Last night- we experienced a Meh moment. We ordered burgers. When they came out- I ate a fry. Took the Bun off the burger- looked at my husband and said. \"I didn't order this.\" But it was the burger with bbq and onion rings on it. It actually was my second choice so I decided to keep it.
    My husband noticed they brought him half/half fries and onion rings. He didn't order that but -whatever.
   server comes back- says sorry these weren't yours, we mixed them up. I start to say- I touched the burger-she was gone. It's very loud in Zipps- BUT When a customer is speaking to you- don't rip the food away and go. My husband said, well, you tried to tell her.
    My point was- I don't want to receive food other people have fingered.eww. And for that reason I will not eat at Zipps again. The food was ok- no complaints on taste.  The place is for sports watching and drinking anyway. Good crowd for the Stanley cup............"}
{"text":"This place continues to get worse and worse.  The quality of food has completely gone down hill and the prices keep raising.  The service is worse then the quality of the food.  Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers is running this place out of business and all Zipps is getting is the people who don't want to wait for a table at cbcb.  They need to do themselves a favor and shut this place down and only keep Goldies."}
{"text":"I will start my review with I've been coming to Goldies and Zipps for over 20 years, you would think with cold beers and cheese burgers coming up strong and now dominating the competition Zipps would do something about it.  I decided tonight to give Zipps another shot after a few horrible experiences at the other locations.  First thing when i walked in the door i was overwhelmed with the smell of sewer coming from the inside of this place.  The server brought us waters and didn't come back for 10 minutes so we moved to the bar.  When we ordered an $8 order of chicken wings, the bartender (a shorter pale man with whisky shakes) said he needed a card to start a tab before we could order wings.  I have never seen anything like this before especially when there is 6 people in the entire place, when i asked why that was he said it's standard on all transactions and it was to protect the company.  If you are going to profile me as a thief, the last thing in the world i want to do is eat your half assed over cooked food with stale bread and fatty chicken while enjoying some of the worst service in the industry. Definitely will not be returning again, when i tried to call down to speak to the a manager nobody answered the phone for a consecutive hour."}
{"text":"Place to ok. Food need improvement. Still a good place to hang out for a drink with Friends."}

{"text":"Tried this place when killing some time before an appointment. Did a happy hour glass of wine and chips. Nice place with friendly staff."}
{"text":"we had a reservation we were a big party pretty good service allowed separate checks i had the cheese quesadilla the guacamole was pretty good and spicy the happy hour specials were good i liked the zipparita i would go again to try more menu items"}
{"text":"This is a 12 dollar salad. Yes you read that right. I guess not every Zipps Location is created equally. Huge thumbs down to this location. Oh and one more thing... the chicken wasn't even cooked all the way thru. All of our orders were below par today. To this location all I have to say is... GET IT TOGETHER!!!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've been to a Zipps I didn't like.  I'm a regular at their parent location called Goldie's.  This new location was a great spot. Awesome service, the food was delicious and fast.  Couldn't ask for anything more!"}
{"text":"This place is evil!!!

They kidnap me with their evil blue cheese burgers and their killer wings and I cant say no.  Just when they have me in their grasps and finish me with dinner, they throw a pizza cookie in front of me.  What kind? Ohh the best kind in the valley..

Seriously though, I became a fan of Zipps about two years ago from a friend who took me there.  Im not much a sports bar person, but what the hell.. We hung out, snacked on wings and had a few drinks.  The golden wings, I think they were called, were just delicious.  I wanted to order more, but then I'd come off as a pig.. don't wanna do that.  I would then try their blue cheese burger, which consisted of two patties, and blue cheese crumbles on top.  The thing literally melts in your mouth.

Dessert...  PIZZA COOKIE.

They bring out this piping hot cookie, straight out of the oven, with vanilla ice cream on top.  If there was a dessert in Heaven... this would be it.  Never in my life have I eaten a dessert so insane.

I love this place, the only reason it didnt get more stars is that at times it's loud. (Duh.. sports bar?)  I know.. and also their iced tea sucks ass.
Im a huge iced tea drinker.. so it's gotta be good."}
{"text":"Greasy, horrible, food. Good waitress.  Boy manager came over to make excuses for the nasty, inedible fare. \"They were busy, the fryer cooled down, over worked kitchen staff, etc, ect.\" It seemed to be a well rehearsed little speil.Then after dropping a $47. tab for two people who couldn't eat most of the greasy food, he presented us with a five dollar gift voucher to use on our next visit! Needless to say, I tipped the waitress in cash and tore up his little trinket. Good tvs, sound and layout. Just DON'T EAT!"}
{"text":"I've never thought very highly of this establishment, but the main reason I'm giving such a low review is due to a very frustrating experience during my last visit.

I will start my review with what I think of the place overall. The food is mediocre at best and sometiemes comes out cold, leaving you wondering why it costs 2x more than most nearby places serving similar--but cheaper and higher quality--items (e.g. five guys, jimmy johns, etc.). The service varies from good to very poor. The only redeeming quality I found is the enormous and plentiful TVs on which to watch your favorite sport, as well as the lively ambiance, especially during important sporting events.

Now I'd like to detail my last experience, which is the main reason that I will never again give this place my business. I visited Zipps with a few friends in January 2016 for an NFL playoff game. The bad part began when halfway into the game I started to feel very sleepy due to lack of sleep the night before. I would have simply paid for my food and driven home if I had not been assigned designated driver for our group that day, so I decided to escape the loudness of the bar by moving to a table just outside, on their patio, a few feet from where my friends were watching the game. I figured I'd put my head down and rest my eyes at one of the many open tables on the patio (most customers were sitting inside watching the game) while my friends enjoyed the rest of the game, but about a minute into closing my eyes I was startled by an aggressive push on my shoulder and opened my eyes to a man standing over me, loudly and rudely telling me that I can't sleep out there. He then tried to tell me to leave. I understand that bars watch out for people who are sleeping because this means they may have had too much to drink; however, I wasn't even drinking and regardless of whether or not I was intoxicated it was an incredibly rude way for an employee to address a customer. He tried to get me to leave as if I was an unwanted freeloader using their tables for sleep, but I told him, much to his disbelief, that I was a paying customer and then went over and joined my friends inside. At this point I was incredibly frustrated by the way I was treated but decided not to complain or do anything about it so as not to create an awkward situation for my friends who were still enjoying the game.

A little while later, as we were watching the 4th quarter, we noticed a homeless man wandering from table to table, being loud and belligerent and asking customers for money and cigarettes. He eventually made his way to our table and started talking to us, asking for money and cigarettes and making crass jokes. We wanted to ask him to leave so we could get back to watching our game but were intimidated by his large stature and obvious state of inebriation. We also didn't ask him to leave because we figured that was up to the employees/bouncers. The bouncers were definitely keeping an eye on him but even after an hour of him making customers visibly uncomfortable they never did anything. By the end of the game he finally left on his own, without purchasing anything.

I just found it so ironic that while he was not a paying customer who was clearly intoxicated and belligerent, the management completely left him alone. Meanwhile, I was a paying customer just minding my own business and yet I was the one who was harassed and treated like I shouldn't be there. I think the bouncers were too afraid to confront this man who rivaled them in physical strength but since I was much smaller than them they felt it was okay to treat me poorly.

I complained to some employees as we were leaving, letting them know how I was treated outside and that we were disappointed the bouncers didn't do their job when it actually mattered. They looked at me as if I was stupid for complaining and simply justified their actions. They basically said the employee was justified in rudely telling me to leave since I could have been intoxicated while also justifying the bouncers actions by saying that the belligerent man left on his own anyway (mind you, this was after over an hour of harassing customers). At this point I realized just how pointless it was to complain since they care so little about their customers and just decided my best course of action would be to leave and never give them my business again--and that's what I did. I haven't been their in months and I feel great about it. There are much better places to get a beer and watch the game anyway."}
{"text":"We had Christina as our server for tonight. She did a great job and kept checking up on us. The food was great and tasted even better. I don't go to Zipps to much but after the service Christina gave us, I would probably come back later this week since it's so close to home. Thank you Christina and your great service!"}
{"text":"Been a fan of Zipps for some time now. Normally stop in here with a coworker at least once a week or so for a burger and or wings.

We've always had prompt service for the most part and the food has always been good. The wings are my personal favorite. I'm not a fan of their fries however. 

Good spot to catch a game and the outside seating is located right on Mill and is always fun to people watch at this location. Only downside to Zipps if they don't have Kilt Lifter from Four Peaks... sad nevertheless."}
{"text":"Sports is in the name, but terrible place to watch anything. Second attempt at some basketball, horrible picture and NO SOUND - won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place has great happy hour specials and is always a great place to catch up with friends! I would strongly recommend the Golden Wings. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I always have great service here. The salads are amazing. The ranch dressing is addictive and I'm obsessed. Thank you zipps for the awesome food and service!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch the game! They have the best wings and salad and all the waitresses are friendly. The chocolate chip cookie skillet is delicious"}
{"text":"Great spot to watch a game and eat some wings. 
The buffalo sauce is amazing. Anything with the buffalo sauce is delicious!
Burgers are decent but they have better options on the menu."}
{"text":"Useta come here when I lived in AZ.  Great place to watch sports. Their wings are great.  It gets super crowded, so be prepared to stand.
Bartending staff can seem pre-occupied, but wait staff on floor gives a good effort.

Fatty type typical bar food, but it's a nice haunt.  Their beer selection could use some diversity.

Story: Last night in AZ before driving home to Oregon.  My friend and I go to Zipps.  We want the hottest wings they have. They warn us---but we insist.  These are the extra hot wings.  We shared and ate every last one.  But woah, they weren't effing kidding.  Ethiopian, Habanero style heat.  Fun times, but next morning not soo fun.  Be warned.  I love a food challenge, though."}
{"text":"Nightly specials are great for those counting pennies. Food is above average for a sports bar. 

The wings are pretty good. If you like yours extra crispy, order them naked with sauce on the side.

Staff is usually upbeat and nice. Sometimes management will even hit the floor to make sure you're getting the service and food up to standard. 

Clean, nice spot to people watch on mill ave. 
Hey it's a nice sports bar. Nuff Said"}
{"text":"I went to Zipps tonight. I sat at the bar.The bartender with red hair was not consistent with the poor of a glass of wine.i saw that she made quite a few mistakes with some orders including mine. She assumed I was with gentle men  next to me. And I was not. I usually get a good poor, not this time. I have had better service from Ryan."}
{"text":"Decent sports bar in the area. They are open late every day which is great. We went for reverse happy hour and tried the chicado (two ground chicken patties, pepper jack cheese, guacamole & fried onion straws). It was okay - the guacamole wasn't fresh and the bun was mediocre. They have different specials every night so we may come try their other food."}
{"text":"Cheap HH deals....good crowd, not too young not too old....ok to bring kids if not on a Friday....foods good and so is service.

This is out go to, proximity and prices always bring us here :)"}
{"text":"I concur with the bad service, I could sit here and write a novel but will only get to the  lowlights. 

Order was taking forever and when we asked our server Bridgett, she never apologized and made a smug comment about having lots of orders in front of ours. As I looked around the restaurant and asked where all the orders in front where going she snapped a quick response that there are lots of take out orders. Would you believe I never saw a single person walk out with one. 

To be fair it was her second week on the job, which brings me to our next opportunity. 

When food was finally ready Nick brought it out and as he was putting the food down on table he spilled a big full glass of water all over the table and over my wife. You would think he would have felt embarrassed and apologetic but instead he laughed the entire time while the rest of our party frantically cleaned it up before we all got wet. 

Oh one more thing, we get our check and they had the gull to charge us for 2 sides of ranch, 1 side of thousand island and jalapeños. 

By this time I was upset so I looked for the manager and to my surprise it was Nick the drink spiller. I brought up the whole terrible incident and said they could have at least comp the extra dressing or jalapeños and his response was classic \"ya I guess we could have\".

Never again and I will tell everyone I know what a horrible experience we had. 

Should have gone to eat fast food."}
{"text":"As usual, amazing food with good service.

I think they have some of the best wings in the valley. They always come hot, and their golden hot is quite the unique flavor. We only go when they have specials, particularly the burger special, which for $6.50 is a serious amount of food.

The only problem was the fact that we ordered wings, and we expected to get a dozen but got only 10. So we thought that maybe we only ordered 10. We looked at the menu and saw no mention of how many wings you got for $8. That's the only reason I took off a star. Other than that we got a ton of greesy, tasty food for $15. Can you beat that?"}
{"text":"Championship establishment here.

I walked in with my significant other and was surprised at how busy it was on a Tuesday night. At first, it didn't click but the entire volleyball team from a nearby high school decided to come so it was extremely busy.

They have some really good specials, but what really caught my eye was the specialty burgers that are $6. Big misunderstanding, most $6 are single patty and have some special toppings. Zipps decided to do a double-stacked specialtly burger. Yes, two 1/3 lb patties on a bun with some special toppings. We got two burgers and split them half and half, green chile burger and sweet jalapeno. Both were extremely awesome. You can get salad, fries, onion rings or half-half (half fries half onion rings). The fries kind of taste like In-n-Out fries, and my significant other would describe them as being better. I don't agree, and I don't disagree. Overall, good food, I can't wait to come back and try something else from their special menu. The $6 specialty burgers are available Tuesdays from 8-close and weekends from 11-4.

The service was really awesome. They definitely cared about us and went out of their way to make sure we were doing okay. I think they felt guilty that we were there when a huge group was there as well. Apparently, they also were understaffed, but it honestly did not feel like it. Seriously though, it was some of the best service I've ever had at a Phoenix restaurant. To top it all off, the manager had checked up on us a few times, and at the end after we paid the bill he brought us a cookie platter (pizzookie, or cookie with ice cream).

Now, I'm not a fan of pizzookie, but wow, their cookie platter was awesome. It wasn't on special that night, but I know its on special some other night and at $4 its probably worth a go again. Might I say one more thing about the cookie platter? It's just as good if not better than BJ's.

I am actually excited to go here again. With some really good food specials almost any night, I think if I ever run out of ideas this might be the first place I think of. The food is a little greasy, but I think that is expected when you go to a sports grill. Want to lose 50 lbs, go to subway. Props to the owners for such an awesome establishment."}
{"text":"$3 Margaritas?  $5 fish and chips?  Sign me up!  Those were the Friday late night specials.  I tried some of the margarita.  It was served blended like a slushie in a small glass, but they packed a lot of liquor in that glass!  We started with the golden wings which were a nice mix of sweet and sour.  The fish and chips were very good, and I opted to have them with sweet potato chips, which were freshly made and delicious.  

Minus one star for the very sluggish service."}
{"text":"Terrible service and terrible attitude. Waiting for 40 minutes for appetizers should not be something we have to deal with. We also told the waitress we were on a time crunch and that did not make a difference."}
{"text":"Actually when arriving I thought service was slow at first and a little dirty (had been a lot of tables just emptying appears). 

But the service got a lot better.  And the food was excellent.   The wings I got the golden medium and I was very impressed (and I'm picky on wings). Buy wife's pizza was excellent.  I had the marinated steak sandwich and I would get that again it was so good.  Our fries came out cold but they quickly replaced and they were very good fresh cut fries. 

Friend had mushroom Swiss burger and said it was nothing short of excellent. 

Would return if in area."}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner with our son. Took over ten minutes for a waitress to come to the table. Prices are stupid expensive. We ordered nachos and chicken skewers. Took close to 30 mins to get our food and when we did get it it was burned and almost cold. Charged $.50cent for a small thing of ranch and a $1 extra for each topping. Really... worst place to go eat. Service sucked ass we won't go back. We should've went to BLU 32 instead"}
{"text":"Hi my  name is Elliott
I have never done this before, but I had such a bad experience that I feel I have to write this review and I hate to even say this, but I had the worst experience I have had in a long time. I had come in to the Zipps on Warner and Gilbert to get something to eat. Two other couples and I were looking to get some food and my friend accidently bumped in two a table on his way to the bathroom. We all ordered food without alcoholic beverages and the server said that management told him my friend had to leave because he was too intoxicated. I understand an establishment not wanting to sere alcohol to someone intoxicated, but no one ordered anything alcoholic to drink. I asked to talk to the manger, which took at least 20 min, he then explained to me that my friend could not stay due to it being a Friday night and its way to busy to deal with this kind of inconvenience. If it was a Monday or Tuesday, no big deal, but since it was a Friday he didn't have the time. The worst part of the entire visit is it put such a sour taste in my mouth I will be apprehensive to return to a Zipp's, if it wasn't for our server we would have given up on the establishment all together."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! and all other zips. Pretty much Happy starts and then ends for one hour and reverse happy hour starts. so between 7-8pm you have no specials but still very reasonable prices for that hour you wait. The food is great and also very cheap!! Wings are awesome BTW!!"}
{"text":"My go to sports bar. Always receive 5 star service, especially from Amber. We are weekly regulars and always go in for the nightly specials. The golden medium wings are to die for,they are the best wings  I have ever had. Overall i recomend everything on the menu, never been disappointed. Keep up the good work zipps!"}
{"text":"Typically we love the food from Zipps (or Goldie's) but this location has let my boyfriend and I down, 2 for 2. 
The first time we had their food, we each ordered the chicken skewers and both orders had shorter than usual, thinner than usual, chicken pieces - the kind that you regret having spent your money on. Our second experience, my focaccia came lazily prepped with dry cracking bread that was not cut into small pieces as usual but instead was loosely uncut. I tried a couple bites but unfortunately it was not so satisfying. I've had this dish before (at a different location) and it was very delicious; regrettably, not what I received tonight from this location. Also, this time, some of my boyfriend's chicken skewers had (what we call) \"bad chicken\" bites, also not so satisfying. 

We have hope for this location but we will not be eating there for awhile! As we are restaurant chain fans though, I am sure we will try it again after a few months! Fingers crossed! :)"}
{"text":"Loud! But what else would you expect from a sports bar?? Service was attentive, thin crispy chips and guac were unusually good, happy hour times and specials are worth noting, the zipperita blended marg had a little kick to it.  I would return on a Saturday night, but only with earplugs."}
{"text":"Zipps is an awesome place to grab a burger and a beer.  Or in my case, a veggie burger and a beer.  We go to Zipps as our local sports bar when we go out to watch a game.  It has tons of TV's and the locals - Cardinals, Diamondbacks, and the Suns are always playing on the big screens.  It's about the only bar that supports local sports.  Also, they have great food for a sports bar and excellent happy hour prices.  Order the half and half, (half fries and half onion ring side).  You will not be disappointed!  Service is always great too."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first trip to Zipps. The place is nice inside and had lots of big tv's to watch the games. 
The food was excellent!!!!  The wings were the best I have had in awhile. They were meaty, juicy, and a little crispy. I had a bacon cheese burger which was one of the best ones I have had in the Phoenix area. They were big patties and most importantly they were freshly made patties and were not the frozen pre made ones like you get at most places. Another bonus was the homemade onion rings. The batter was light and crispy.
I also like that they had specials for everyday and night of the week.  It's a locally owned restaurant and I like the fact that there food is made fresh.  I will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't mind the bar atmosphere but having a gentlemen that is yelling at the top of his lungs makes people uncomfortable. Food was descent."}
{"text":"Received our food an hour after we ordered it. Waitress said it was a new cooking staff. This was a Friday night during March madness. When we finally received our food, it was bad. The nachos had unmelted cheese on most of it and our focaccia was really dry. We also noticed at least another 2 tables get up and leave before receiving their food. On the plus side, Nellos is next door and they got their sh*t together."}
{"text":"The main reason I love going to Zipps is because of their wings!! 

If you have a group, they will make you wait until your entire group is present before seating you. It's frustrating. Their wait staff can take a while to get around to you as well which is also frustrating. However, their \"saving grace\" is their food and their Zipperitas. They also have a nice array of TVs so you can catch a game while you eat and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"OK I was not allowed to drink filtered water at this specific location. I have brought in my  own hydro flask numerous times to this location and many others in the  chain ....... After contacting the corporate office I was given an unacceptable illogical explanation as to why.Yelp stop removing this factual review"}
{"text":"Wings are awesome. I love the casual of Zips, consistent bar food dependable and comfortable. College hang, nothing more but the food is good."}
{"text":"Ordered the Philly Egg Rolls. They came out still frozen in the middle. It's hit or miss if the waitress will be decent or not."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times. It's hit or miss. One time we had great service, the next it was horrible. The last time it was average to above average.

Burgers are ok, But the Philly Cheese Steak Egg Rolls are amazing. Just make sure they get cooked. Twice we have had ones still frozen in the middle."}
{"text":"Honestly not sure what all the terrible reviews are talking about. I've always had good food and generous pours of beer. The servers are friendly, too. The only negative I've experienced is that the wait to be seated and to get food/drink refills can be ridiculously long, even when they are seemingly not that busy. This is definitely not somewhere you should come if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Salsa tasted like onion water, chicken was overly dry...not off to a good start :("}
{"text":"I love sports bars because the environment is loud and you can take your kids out on a dinner date without worrying about them disturbing people around you because the adults are yelling more than the toddlers.
Whew!
Our daughter is learning colors so when the waitress gave her some crayons my husband was asking her to name each color. When she got it right, there happened to be a home run on the giant screen and the whole place erupted in cheers. My daughter thought everyone was cheering for her and her reaction was priceless. She was so proud of herself. So thank you for allowing an atmosphere where the parents may go out and enjoy themselves with the whole family. 
It created a wonderful moment and memory.
The food was delicious and the staff was great too!"}
{"text":"We love Zipps, but the Tempe location on Mill is a joke!! Don't waste your time going to this location!  I agree with the other reviewers in that the manager is a complete douchbag!  It is because of his poor service, that we will never visit this location again."}
{"text":"Zips has great salads and wings, it usually takes a really long time to get the food, my service is on and off every time but over all good food!"}
{"text":"Loud and casual so it was perfect for us after getting into town.  Football and basketball games were in the tv's so there was a lot to watch.  It was Saturday night and move in time at ASU do lots of new Sum Devils in the place.  The burgers were good and the beer was cold."}
{"text":"I've never posted a review on Yelp before this. I've never felt the need to, honestly. But something has to be said about this. 

Let me start by saying that the service and staff get 5 stars. They were accommodating for our very large party and on point for getting our orders out quickly.

I ordered the Fish \"Tacos\". A taco. How can anyone Eff up a taco? At the most basic its a corn (or flour) tortilla, folded in half with a filling of some sort. It's a basic Mexican dish.

Unless you come to Zipps. Someone decided to make the \"taco\" into a burrito and call it a \"taco\".  A tasteless, bland, burrito served with greasy chips and what tasted like bottled salsa on the side. The chipotle sauce was equally bland and in need of salt and acid. Look, if you can't put pepperoni, mushrooms, cheese and garlic in a tortilla and roll it up and called it a \"pizza\" then you can't call this a TACO. I would be more forgiving if it actually tasted good.

If I could solely rate on service, these guys are amazing!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe the reviews that are any less than five stars. I have been a fan of Zipps since I have moved to the Phoenix area. This location just opened near our house and I was doing back flips. Sure they have some growing pains of a new location but those are quickly getting worked out.

The food as with all Zipps is what I will call Bar Food, although better quality than you would get in most bars. They have healthier options like my wife likes, and then the stuff with taste like I love! It always comes out hot, and tasting good. They are training cooks still so the food is a little bit different from the Scottsdale location that I go to by my work.

The atmosphere is killer, there are enough TV's to watch what ever game you want. I understand there were some issues with March Madness however this was one of their opening weeks I would expect a problem or two. 

Staff is killer as well, friendly and willing to make sure your experience is great. They are there enough to make sure you're needs are met, and not there enough to annoy you. 

This is a sports bar, so if I was looking for a nice quiet sit down place for a date with the wife or something quiet I wouldn't go here, but if you want good drinks, great food, and friendly staff this is the place to go. 

If you're at work and need a quick lunch but not fast food this is my first choice."}
{"text":"Went out for drinks and wings with some friends. There's not that great of drink specials, and they aren't very accommodating with special orders. The golden hot wings were good, just the right amount of spice. There wasn't a large crowd, service was pretty quick. I tried the Ziparita, amazing!! Definitely a must try. The waitress wasn't the best, rarely came around to check if we needed more drinks or food. Overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Can we give them zero stars? Horrible food, horrible service and their business is now trying to shut down our community's farmer's Market which takes place behind their building. This is absolutely not a community-minded restaurant and I would be happy if they would leave!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would.... we waited over an hour for our food, when we brought it to the manager's attention he was unapologetic, extremely rude and borderline verbally abusive. If you want to wait an hour for your food, and have an incompetent manager threaten you... I HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"Zipps needs to offer the option of ordering all flats. At Buffalo Wild Wings, you can pay $1 more to get all flats and no drummies."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me so long to try this place out. I've been here twice and the both times the waitresses were always attentive and polite! The wings are not my favorite (I'm heart belongs elsewhere) but they are still really good!! The ziparitas are a always a good start to the night !"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my service from Jennifer at Zipps today! Myself as well as my friends were charged incorrectly and she would not change it. We also had our food taken away before we finished. And then had to pay for another slice of pizza to replace the one that was taken prematurely. I have been coming here for a while and I have never been thrilled with the service but today was especially bad. I suggest thinking twice before choosing to eat here."}
{"text":"Most Worst Bar/Restaurant  Ive Ever Been To They Are Over Staffed  For No reason There Food Taste Disgusting only thing good is there hot wings and even then only wen you tell them well  done. Bar Has Nothing Good i Settled For A house wine after they had nothing to offer beside vodka shots and zipperitas  wont spend my time or money there ever again"}
{"text":"So I went to two Zipps locations this weekend for two separate football games.  This location definitely made a bigger impact on me, and not in a good way.

Food was alright...nothing too amazing...but it is a sports bar.  I wasn't expecting much.  

Drinks...my friends loved their drinks...I didn't drink this night.  I knew I was going to be riled up for the Lions/Saints game (sadly not in a positive way since the Lions lost!)

It was the service that killed the whole experience.  Our server...and I wished I remembered her name (I think we never got it actually) was simply AWFUL!  She had this fetish about clearing napkins up (I set my napkin down for a second and there she was whisking it away...and also she took a napkin on mine that had a phone number on it) but she didn't know how to clear the baskets away or wipe down the table that had wet spots everywhere.  And when we wanted more drinks in the second half of the game...she was non-existent.  We asked other servers for our server and they were clueless about who had our table.  My friend had to go to the bar to get another drink (which was finally during happy hour)

Minus the service...the bar is just a typical sports bar.  Nothing too special."}
{"text":"Several times  I have gone in looking for a TV showing the Arizona Diamondbacks game and this place didn't have it on but did have other teams games.  NOTE TO MANAGEMENT:  YOU NEED TO WALE UP AND MAKE SURE YOUR HOMETOWN TEAM IS ON TV RATHER THAN EUROPEAN SOCCER AND OTHER CRAPPY FOREIGN SPORTS!!!!

Went here again on April 8th.  Guess what?  Walked in to watch the D-Backs game and it wasn't on.  But they did have women's soccer and NASCAR!   

Why can't this place catch a clue?"}
{"text":"Absolutely worst service I've seen.  We came on Sunday and we're on waiting list to sit and my wife had to tell waitresses which tables were open where we could sit.  We then got worst table in the place and complained that other better tables were open.  The manager wouldn't let us sit at other better tables and he was a rude jerk to my wife.  Also, their food is extremely greasy to the point where it's unhealthy."}
{"text":"This is the newest of the Zipps clan located off Bethany Home in Central Phoenix. It's a smaller bar but still a great place.  This used to be the old COX building so maybe that has something to do with all the HD TVs they have.  Practically every seat had a good view of the games going on."}
{"text":"Hmmm feeling conflicted....

First of the service was great.  Sat at the bar too and the bartender Ashely was excellent.  She not only was very personal but also was a prime example of what all bartender should be. Funny, witty, attentive, while still providing top notch service.   She alone along with her bar mates ( sorry I didn't catch their names) would make me want to come back. 

The food was very average. I ordered the chicken skewers which were very bland. Literally just breaded chick with bland flour in a fryer. And also ordered a half basket of fries and onion rings.  Again the batter on the wings tasted just like deep fried flour. No salt or seasoning. Overall the food was at least consistent. Consistently bland that is... 

Luckily for Zips their bartenders made up for the poor food and I'd gladly go back for drinks and a game. I'll just skip the food. 

The three stars is solely based on the service otherwise, I'd give it much less."}
{"text":"The golden sauce is delicious. The service is typically great. It's my favorite local spot any night or time of the week!"}
{"text":"I waited over ten minutes after seating oursekves at a table here and nobody acknowledged or handed us menus. We ended up leaving.  Wasnt busy at all. Never coming back. Would give it 0 stars if i could."}
{"text":"My family had the worst experience at Zipps Gilbert tonight. 
The service is usually very good and we love the wings. Kelly is an awesome bartender and for the past 12 YEARS we have always loved coming to Zipps. Tonight however was a complete twilight zone of what we have come to expect and what we appreciate about Zipps. 
Zipps is not perfect. We understand that with the amount of volume that they do the fewer changes or requests the better. What happened tonight however had nothing to do with ordering something off the menu and was completely disrespectful and insensitive to some of their best and most loyal  customers.
BE WARNED!!! DO NOT BRING YOUR OWN WATER to this restaurant. 
My son was told that he could not have a hydroflask of WATER at the table. 
First off - if you have ever had the water at Zipps then you know that they do not filter their water. A whole lemon does not help, that is how terrible it is. But this is not what I take issue with. We have come to accept how horrible the water is and it does not matter to me as I mostly drink the beer. 
The issue is that the manager that was working felt it was more important to show his dominance over the wait staff by enforcing a made up pretend rule so that he could have a \"teaching moment\" (his actual words) than to resolve the situation by rationally discussing the option of taking the hydroflask to the car so that we could get past this and enjoy the rest of our evening. 
I am old school in that I believe that the customer experience is what matters. I am kind of a stickler as I insist that my server is an actual human person and not a robot.
The server could have explained their policy and could have related to our experience while expressing an actual human response to what was now an awkward situation. 
I asked for the manager. Because of the obvious tension, I requested a different server.  I expressed that I felt she might not be in the best frame of mind to provide great customer service.
His response was \"Why?\"
Why should I have to explain that our continued interaction with this server was unlikely to get better?? Should I have to elaborate that I felt  there was no way that the service improves from here?!?
By this point, She is not happy to wait on us and we felt that she is a shallow person who needs to work in any other industry other than customer service and she should not be trusted around anyone's food.
We were willing to stay with a new server but accommodating this request was beyond the manager's comprehension.
The manager that was working on Friday night, June 15th 2018 has his head up his southern most orifice and would do better making people miserable at a rental car counter than managing a restaurant. Maybe the customer is not always right but are the customers here for you are you here for them?
Do you really think that you need dominate customers like you do your staff and that this is what makes the restaurant successful?
Maybe you do and maybe that is what explains the lack of business and the discontent that was witnessed in your restaurant and with your staff tonight.
So many other choices ...
Thank you for your hospitality as we left and had an excellent experience at Blue32 tonight."}
{"text":"The 'Bowl' of soup is literally smaller than the cup of soup!!! Shame!!

Still no wifi???"}
{"text":"I like this place. Great happy hour and daily specials (after 8pm) on food and drink ($3-$6, variety of items on special and it changes night to night). 

Nice patio w TVs. Friendly servers. Decent TVs, though some could be bigger and there should be more in the dining area (esp on the patio side of the dining area). 

-1 star for no wifi

-1 star for such a small men's room for such a big bar."}
{"text":"Very disappointing TV situation at the bar. Waaaay too few (two per side?!) and small! Same could be said for the dining and patio areas. No TVs really visible from the 6 booths by the shuffle board. Should be some hanging from ceiling.  I'm really shocked. There's room for many more and bigger TVs throughout the entire restaurant and bar. TVs on patio suffer from extreme glare - needs a cover.

Covered parking in the ramp."}
{"text":"No wifi?!  What the heck??

Graffiti on bathroom mirror

Wastebasket in men's room overflowing w paper towels

Small TVs behind bar and too few of them."}
{"text":"NO WIFI?!?!  Ouch!!

SUPER small TVs for a sports bar and also too few of them and they're poorly placed.

The Zipps on Bethany Home is much better but still no WIFI.  Wow."}
{"text":"I rarely give negative/low reviews but it's apparent the zipps Corp doesn't care about this location. This is the closest to my house and my wife and I drive an extra 10 min to avoid this location. The food is always sub par. I went a few weeks ago with a friend and the waitress completely forgot to put in our order. We waited about 20 minutes and then she finally came back and said she had a \"goldfish moment\" and offered to give us a 2nd appetizer instead of comping the one we had already ordered. Definately wouldn't come back or recommend. Zipps in general I love and have been going to for years all over the valley but hate to say this one doesn't meet expectations by any means. #verydisappointed"}
{"text":"The service at this particular location is always super slow. It doesn't matter what time or day. Their water is also gross, but it is at all of their locations. Food is delicious though. I get the wings or The Monaco focaccia. Their sweet potato chips are good too. Overall, food is pretty good but service is slow. So don't plan on coming here if you're on a time constraint."}
{"text":"One beer. I'm glad I didn't \"check-in\" here because it's retarded. After putting too many beers on EVERYBODY's tab they wanted to argue about which waitress did/didn't bring us a beer. A receipt was brought out by the manager with TIMES written on it! Ridiculous. Won't be back."}
{"text":"When I first started coming here 3 years ago I would have rated this 3 1/2 to 4 stars. Service and pricing went downhill subsequently last year would have rated about two and a half Stars. Went in today for happy hour ordered a happy hour craft beer which is advertise at $5 and the waitress told me it was $5, when the bill came it was $6.50 and it's considered a premium craft. Unable to change the error... no longer many people in there for happy hour... I can see why. Won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"This is probably the best zipps that I have been into, some of the other locations should do exactly as the service does here.   Server was excellent manager came over and ensured our food and service was great.  Food was absolutely perfect with no issues at all and the bottomless iced tea really hit the spot.  This is in my opinion the best zipps in the valley.  Also they have plenty of parking and inside or outside seating for you."}
{"text":"On the afternoon we went they were somewhat busy, had to wait an excessively long time though for.our server.  All in all it was pretty decent they do have.the wings that were perfectly done and the.golden hot sauce is well worth it to try.  I do think that the extra charges.for sauce and dressing is a bit much though.  All in all it was good."}
{"text":"I couldn't remember why I stopped getting take out From here for the last 1.5 yrs. Then I went yesterday and remembered why.  Wings have no sauce and if you ask for saucy, extra sauce they Nickle and dime you for an extra .50 cents. 

What sux is that it was my lunch 30 min. I can pick it up but if it sux I don't eat lunch.  When I called the manager he actually told me to bring 9 wings back on Monday in 2 days.  Pics to follow.  Pisses me off I have to send pics and what an idiot manager to ask for pics of their sub par product.

The golden medium wings are amazing just don't expect them at the 100st:FLW location!!!"}
{"text":"I was in town from NJ and I stopped here for a bite before going to the airport.

The atmosphere was nice with the outdoor section and the open air.  The drinks and service were also good.

The food however was horrible.  I tried the cheesesteak rolls and mozzarella rolls which just tasted bad.  I would go there to drink but not to eat."}
{"text":"We went to this location because it was convenient and on our way home from work. We met my boyfriend's parents for dinner and after they left we stayed for a few drinks. The food was great and both waitresses that served us that evening were fantastic during the service. The reason this review is lacking two stars is because the end got a little weird. The waitress brought us our bill (for only the 3 drinks we had after dinner because dinner was already paid for) I put my card in the little leather booklet and she quickly picked it up. When she brought the bill back she set it on the table and started walking away. At that point my boyfriend noticed my card had been charged $56. He quickly called out to her and she came back and he calmly asked her why the card was charged for $56 when my bill was only $14. She responded by saying that it would void off. He said that is fine but he would like a receipt for proof that it was going to be voided. She proceeded to get upset that he was inquiring about a solution to the mistake that had been made. All of a sudden she started bawling and yelling about how she's worked 60 hours this week and in a snarky tone asked if he wanted to talk to her manager. He was baffled because he hadn't even been rude or upset about the mistake. He just wanted to make sure for my sake that the mistake was fixed. She snatched up the bill and ran off still crying and we could see her talking to another employee at the computers. She started walking back over (still crying) she said something like \"that wasn't your fault\", tossed down the bill and walked away with no other explanation. We looked at the bill and it had been adjusted to the correct amount although there was still no receipt showing that the $56 had been voided. I signed the check and we looked around thinking maybe a manager was going to come and talk to us about the incident or that the waitress would come back with an explination but after sitting there for about 10 minutes unnoticed we got up and walked away. The only part of this that I am upset about is that there was no explanation or apology for the mistake that was made with my card or the outburst of emotion from the upset waitress. I understand that people have bad days and if she has worked 60 hours this week then I know her pain. The fact that she got upset just shows that she is human but the fact that there was no explanation for the mistake of my card being charged $56 or an apology for the outburst of the employee shows me that this establishment is not concerned with good quality customer service which is something I am disappointed to say because during dinner I told my boyfriend we had to stop here more often because I loved their patio seating. :("}
{"text":"Water tastes like dirt or mildew or something, as well as the fountain drinks. They also can't cook an egg correctly, everything is oily...the list is endless honestly. If you see this place RUN."}
{"text":"The food is terrible, the drinks are good and cheap yet I'm a chef and it's sad to see the shit they put out here"}
{"text":"Upscale Chilis.  Food is decent, though I was fooled when I ordered a wrap expecting a tortilla wrap and instead got flat bread.  It was still very good, but I wonder what else isn't mentioned on the menu.  Great fries, great service, love the booths."}
{"text":"When I go it is for their wings and my favorite dessert... The cookie skillet. I also like their french fries and the burgers are good. It is a very noisy environment and don't sit outside unless you want cigarette smoke blowing towards you the whole time."}
{"text":"My wife, son(14) and daughter (12) come to this Zipps roughly 2 times a month and have always had good food and service. My BIGGEST Complaint is that if this is a \"Sports Bar\" then why can't we have the sound of the Diamondbacks game on? Most of the people in here are watching the game & want to hear it as well. This could finally cause me to stop coming here! I would really like to hear from the owner Todd Goldman on why he won't play the sound of the game. He's definitely not supporting our local teams even though he has their logos plastered all over the walls."}
{"text":"My work team decided this was going to be our lunch spot for our monthly outing and to also celebrate my birthday. Unfortunately, we ended up walking out without any service. It was 7 of us and we received the worst welcoming ever! Apparently, they are not hard up for business because they can deny 7 people for business. They wanted to sit all 7 of us on a small table. We had moved a table to accomodate us and a waiter came around to tell us that 6 people normally fit and at a single table and to just pull a chair over. Keep in mind that we are not super models. There are guys who work out and ladies who eat healthy. He was not budging on the fact that we were comfortable with the extra small table we pulled and continued to ask that we squeeze all in. The place was damn near empty but he said, \"We could get busy and might need that table\". So we said buh bye!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to this location for almost a year now. Not only is there a happy hour M-F 3-7 but they also have nightly specials from 8 to close. On weekends they have \"hangover specials\" from 11-4. I could go into detail for what days have what specials but there are just so many, the website gives a full listing.
I have tried many different items here and I can't say anything has disappointed me. Last night I had the Black & Bleu burger and it melted in my mouth with the most amazing flavors. I must say it's now my favorite burger there, replacing the mushroom swiss. My boyfriend never strays from the Sweet Jalapeno burger, which you can ask for fresh jalapeno on the side to add to your liking. 
The focaccia's are very interesting and wrapped in a sort of thick pita bread and sliced into pieces like sushi, sometimes in two halves. I've had the Monaco, Buffalo, and Philly Cheese Steak - all quite delicious. The Philly takes the lead with the hot pepper assortment. 
Pizza slices are pretty good, thin crust and light sauce. They have a special on tacos Wednesday nights that come in a 4 pack, you can pick all chicken, all beef, or half & half. Warning - MESSY, but also satisfying, too greasy for my taste but that's how they are supposed to be, it is bar food after all. 
On Friday nights they have fish on special and you can have a sandwich, fish & chips, or the tacos. I've had the sandwich before and loved it, but 3 shots of jager on special and beer may have helped my taste buds! Mozzarella sticks are made differently than you expect, but make you crave more in such an evil way (battered cheese hello waistband.) The wings are some of the best in the area, full of meat and any choice of sauce you'd like. We get the golden hot, the sweetness is addicting.
Side choices are simple fries, onion rings, or a salad. The fries are decent, I order mine well done because I like a crunch. Usually I will get a salad but I would suggest ordering it in another basket because they put it right next to your burger if you don't, and I like oil & vinegar dressing (which resulted in a semi-soggy foccacia one night that the manager graciously took care of.) 
Desserts are brownie or cookie in a skillet, with ice cream on top. The also have the classic Root Beer Float. 
One of our favorite things about this Zipps is our top of the line waitress, Tische. Somehow we end up sitting in her section most of the time and have become her regulars. Always a great attitude, funny and caring. Even if she isn't waiting on us during a meal she will stop by to see how we are doing. 
Overall just a great place to eat and have a chance to try the wide menu with all the specials. We went to one other location and it was less than impressive, the service was slow and the food didn't live up to what we have come to love here.
The only SMALL suggestion I have is to add a good coleslaw to the side choices, it's one of my favorite things to go along with a tasty sandwich.
Anyone who didn't like a certain dish they ordered, try again with something else! They don't cook bad food, some people just have different tastes =)"}
{"text":"I love this place. The happy hours and the reverse happy hours are fabulous. The reason I keep coming back is for their bomb wings amongst other things. I seriously crave their wings sometimes. Golden crispy with the right amount of heat. Gah... I'm already craving them again as I write this...

Get the wings \"golden\" with your personal heat level. You won't regret and will thank me :) make sure you wash you hands THOROUGHLY afterwards. Don't try taking out your contacts our rub your eyes for at least three washes afterwards. 

Service was great tonight. Five stars tonight but I'm rounding out because there have been other numerous occasions when they were sub 3's. 

Solid place to watch the games and enjoy some wings with cold brew."}
{"text":"I like the environment (typical sports bar). I visited this past Sunday around noon with my boyfriend and his friends. They ordered the burgers and those looked great. My boyfriends onion rings came out a little on the cool side, but still tasted pretty good. I ended up trying the Chicken Roll-ups on the appetizer menu and was very disappointed. They were bland as was the jalapeno sauce that came on the side. I've had food there before and liked it, but these roll-ups are not something I will ever order again."}
{"text":"Zipps is all about sports on TV's, hot wings and happy hour.  Place is packed around dinner time.  Family friendly menu options."}
{"text":"I've come here with friends the past couple Sundays to watch football. We've had the chicken nachos, extra hot wings, and pepper jack foccacia. The wings were really good, as was the sauce. It was addicting although it burned my mouth from being so spicy. I had heard people recommend their foccacias and the pepper jack one I had was very good. The sweet jalapeno sauce they served it with wasn't something I liked, but it went fine with ranch. The drinks are good and they have different drink/food deals each day of the week. I was there for almost 5 hours the last time I went and my bill was very reasonable. Further, I wound up changing tables three times due to weather and TV view and had three different servers the whole time. They were all very attentive towards our table. Will definitely keep coming here for football games."}
{"text":"Went there on game day expecting to have a good time at a college bar on game day. I ordered the chicken bbq sandwich, took 2 bites and immediately knew it wasn't right. 20 minutes later I was on the verge of throwing up from food poisoning. When the bar manager (I assume she was the bar manager because she told all the other bar tenders what to to) asked me why I looked so pale and haven't finished my beer, I told her the chicken was not good and had gotten me sick. She started to laugh and said literally word for word, \"Haha you're the second person to say that today. I hope the cooks do something about it.\" ARE YOU EVEN IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY???? If a customer says they got SICK from your food, you should probably say something to the cooks? She sent her manager over who was completely incompetent and offered no solution besides offing me another plate which I wouldn't have been able to eat because I was already sick. If you come across this place, keep walking."}
{"text":"New to the area and went exploring with my husband. In the mood for a sports bar and good food to watch the Michigan state and Kentucky basketball game.  Took advantage of the happy hour chips and salsa, on which the guacamole was delicious, not too salty, same with the chips. I can't stand over salty goods that take away from the natural taste. Also took advantage of the beer deals for a couple of bucks!  Nothing too crazy nor unique on draft, but ya can't beat the beers that you're familiar with.  The atmosphere for  sports games is great!! At least 18 TVs (and yes, I counted).  Went for a sandwich from the menu that was different from back home, the chicken focaccia.  I found the proportion to be the perfect amount and the sandwich delicious! This place is a great place to hang out with friends, especially for a game. Loud enough to bring an infant (which we did). Oh and our server was awesome, quick, efficient, friendly and offered up places to visit!"}
{"text":"Great.  No.  Awesome television set up!  Food= good.  Decent bar food.  But... what's with the 'head' on the beers?  When I order a beer, I don't want 2 be ripped off of multiple ounces of beer (check out other reviews).  PS. The Zipps on Camelback is way better..."}
{"text":"First, there is a bartender named Michelle who is very very awesome. 

Now, to the rest of it.  The service is inconsistent, and the food...well, I just didn't like it that much.  Seeing as how they recently opened, I was surprised at the lack of visible leadership.  Ahwatukee is a pretty small place, and the folks here respond well when the management is present and friendly. Reading other reviews, it seems that I should have tried the golden wings, so I'll put it on my list for next time.  I have only had 2 appetizers, but they weren't good enough to warrant an entree.

It's in a convenient location, and the bar is set apart so that when don't feel like being around kids (no offense), you don't have to. I won't cross it off my list, cause a good bartender is always a good sign.  But, there isn't anything new about it, just another sports bar - which is fine by me."}
{"text":"Our favorite hangout! My family and I have been going there for years for the amazing wings and drinks. If you plan on going there for happy hour or on football Sunday, get there a bit early to get a seat. 

For the most part costumer service is always great, but just be a little more patient when the place is packed."}
{"text":"Took 1 hr to get food. Portions were too small. Waitress not attentive. Even the pen to sign the check with didn't work. One star only for the fair pricing. We will never go here again."}
{"text":"Always impressed with the service we receive. Ryan is our favorite bartender and we look forward to sitting at the bar when he is working. The food is delicious bar food and their happy hour specials cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"Went here for football on Sunday. It wasn't too crowded and the food was pretty good. Had some wings, chicken nachos and a burger. We asked for extra chips and they brought us out a big bowl of them. Beer came in buckets of 5, so we always had some cold ones in reach. They had all the games on and service was pretty good. 

Like all other Zipps in the area, they have shuffleboard, pool and darts. They also have a Galaga/Mrs. Pacman machine, so you can make halftime go by pretty quick. 

When we first got there, there was kind of a funky smell, not sure if it went away, or I just got used to it. Also, their draft beer selection needs some work. Alaskan Amber was the only true micro in tap."}
{"text":"I love zipps. Go there all the time so when we moved so close to this one we were excited! Unfortunately wrong.  We Went in with my 70 year old mom to watch some football and when my mom asked the waitress if she could use one of the bar chairs because it has a back on it and is better on her back the waitress gave her a snarky look and said I need to ask my manager. She was gone for a minute and came back and said her manager said no.... so we went to sit in the dining room section and the waitress was more interested in being a bitch than help us. Wont be going back. Went to the zipps on Ray and had a great time!"}
{"text":"I love that Zipps has expanded throughout the valley.  This location is fairly close to my house.  We wanted some wings and we decided on Zipps.  I didn't feel that this location had the normal Zipps atmosphere from other locations I've been to.  Maybe it was an off night I'm not sure, but it was a Saturday night.  I didn't like the layout and the service was ok.  The chambord margarita was lacking taste and it wasn't enough to order a second one.  The wings were also ok.  I chose hot with even a side of hot, but it seemed that the sauce they used was a different flavor from what I remember tasting.  I wasn't too impressed with the food or service so it's safe to say I probably won't be coming back to this particular location."}
{"text":"went to watch a game with friends. service was awful. food was worse. will never go back."}
{"text":"I LOVE Zipps but this experience will make my decision easier!  Never will I come back to this location!  The WORST service ever and I'm in the service industry.  We've been going to Zipps since they opened on Camelback and Miller and never had to wait longer than 10-15 minutes for anything, tonight it was 50 minutes for 2-kids meals, wings and 3- nonalcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"We went there last night a little before 10:30..they have a bar side and a restaurant side. .we sat on the restaurant side because we had someone with us that was only 18..the waitress took our drink orders (the minor ordered a Coke) then came back and told us we would need to get our food to go since we had a minor with us and they can't be there past 11..it was only 10:30! Why have split sides if you can't have a minor in there to eat after 11?? It clearly days when you walk in noone under 21 on this side .  So. . We happily took our business down the street to native new yorker who had split bar and restaurant and spent our money there.  Which we will do from now on!   I will never go back to zipps!

After reading all the other reviews i am glad we didn't eat there! !"}
{"text":"Wings and Beer Wings and Beer Wings and Beer Wings and Beer

Excellent happy hour and reverse too!

Burgers and other menu items are Y U M, but almost always get WINGS!

Fave bar in valley because of the quality of food/drink at great prices and MORE!

Thank you Zipps!"}
{"text":"This location has gone WAY down hill. Used to go here A LOT but will never EVER go again. Food wasn't the same. Had a $60 gift card, our bill was $95, we split bill with friend of ours. They were charged $15 last night & we were charged $20. We both left cash tip.
This morning we checked our bank, we were charged $15 extra & they were charged $13 extra.
Not only did service suck, food was terrible they charged us way, way extra. I will never go to this zipps ever again. Very disappointed WOW"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and it's self seating which is totally fine with us! We sat down and we waited and waited and waited until we had to grab a server ourself to give us a menu. Once we had the menu the server disappeared and we once again had to ask him if we could place our order. I too am a server and know the demands of customers can get overwhelming but when me and my boyfriend initially came in and sat down there was only one other table sitting. I asked for water and never got it. They brought my food out and not my boyfriends until ONCE AGAIN we had to ask for it. Not once did the server introduce himself, ask us if we need anything, or checked on us. I love zipps but I will NEVER come back to this location and I will make sure everyone I know knows about the experience I had. Terrible customer service and the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"I'd been seen twice at my table at 50 minutes. When she finally came, no apology. I used to be in the food business. Let me pull this and i would be F.I.R.E.D. on the fly!!!! Manager comes by. Said she'd look into the matter. Haven't seen her in like 10 minutes. She comes back and claims I was seen many times!? Why not just call me a liar? I have no reason to lie. Should have gone to fuzzy's. it's kinda insulting!"}
{"text":"The food took 45 mins to come out.  It was all very bland and the fries were cold. The service was slow."}
{"text":"I mean it was ok... Wait staff was horrible, the food was good though which is the 2 stars."}
{"text":"Good place to go watch a football game. Service is slow each time I have been there. Their wings are flavorful."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! If you are looking for a great place especially for Happy hour! This is the place! I've been here in Phoenix for almost a week now and I've been trying to explore and see what Phoenix has to offer and by goly I found a great spot! ZIPPS! 

First coming I was really shocked! It was PACKED! Like PACKED! I never seen a place filled with lots of energy and people! Especially on a Wednesday night! That's when I knew this had to be a great place! I mean what's more welcoming other than coming to a place where it's dead, quiet and you can hear that cricket in the corner chirping that sad song? Or coming into a place where you're like \"Heck yes I feel you! Let's get this on!\" Well that's how I felt! 

So their happy hour menu was amazing. $1.50 slice of pizza, $3 Zipperitas...in which let me warn you, they only limit 3 per person! These little suckers may appear to be small at first glance, but man do they stir up a punch! One of these little torpedoes and I was feeling my world beginning to lose it's equilibrium! But the best part is...they taste GREAT!!! So next thing you know you had 3 of these amazing Zipperitas and you're laughing, yelling, having that great time of your life!

Aside from the super affordable food and drinks, there are little mini games and lots of TV with different sports playing. I mean it is a Sports Grill so they really have it! With people cheering for their favorite team to people playing against eachother at the mini games. It's a really great and fun place to be! So if you're ever in town be sure to put this on your stop points!"}
{"text":"Chicken fingers were odd...but good beer selection! Service was good. Was hard to get to because of construction I had to turn around 4 times. Many televisions good place to watch sports"}
{"text":"Great chicken wings Tuesday nights are my favorite with mike and Amber behind the bar shuffleboard and golden tee too regulars are all nice great time every time i come"}
{"text":"Ok, this is the second time that I have come here to watch a major sporting event and it wasn't on the big screen. Today it's the Home Run Derby.  I asked if they would be showing it on the big screen with sound. The response, again, was, \"NO.\"  REALLY?!!!! The place was empty and there was nothing else to watch.  You're a sports bar lmao. My friends and I will be spending our $$$$$ elsewhere from now on at more accommodating \"sports bars.\""}
{"text":"Served me wings after waiting a good 30 minutes that were undercooked. Then they said the next order would be another 45 mins. Way to correct your mistake."}
{"text":"Was in on a busy Friday night with a large group of people. Many of us would come and go, opening many tabs and having lots of drinks. We got there around 4 and stayed at the same table until 10pm. Our server was Kayla and she kicked ass! Never have I seen someone be so on top of everything, especially at a sports bar. Wanted to give her a shout out and we will definitely be back Zipps, soon!"}
{"text":"Food was all pretty average rafting bar food; nothing stood out. Showed up for Sunday football with five friends. The chicken spring rolls were bland. The nachos were soggy and bland. The cheese sticks which I thought looked awesome in their spring roll wrap were undercooked and had a major backfire using the wrap because it was way to thick. My friend's jalapeño burger was good but majorly greasy. 

The topper came when we asked to order wings with the sweet and hot sauces mixed. Answer was a flat out NO. The waitress didn't know why, just that they weren't allowed to do it. I contemplated the physics of taking two liquid type sauces and mixing them together. I wondered how the idea ever came up to mix whiskey with coke, Neapolitan ice cream, or cinnamon with butter. These were obviously pioneers in the fields of magic and sorcery. I doubt I will be brave enough to come back for fear if being possessed by these magical beings that I am powerless against. 

On a serious note, I worked in restaurants for over twenty years. The reasons the cooks don't like mixing sauces is because they have a container to clean before they can use it again. I've received a little grief ordering wings this way before but never a flat out no. Even when I said no thanks I don't need anything then, she stuck to her guns. I'm all about customer service; within reason. Seems pretty minor but I think it's the little things that make a place great; or not so great."}
{"text":"Awful. Worst bar food I've had in years. Fries were weak, sort if spongy. Onion rings were unrecognizable oil carriers. Zipp burger was nothing like description, paltry on the tartar sauce. Friend picked at her child and another found paper wrapper inside her sandwich. Management comped that. I couldn't even bother complaint about mine. I just wanted out. Yes, good tv screens, friendly but overly stretched staff. Maybe ok for a drink at bar. I wont be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service, but the food just wasn't very good. The batter for the chicken strips was greasy and mushy. Everything else was bland. Beer list was just ok. The best thing about our visit was the cool reprieve from the heat. 

So, there you have it. If you need a cool place to get out of the heat, Zipps is fine. Otherwise, Mill Ave offers tastier options."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! We went here on Sunday for lunch and it was SO GOOD and well priced!! I had a ziparita which was in special for $4 and it was yummy!! (I'm a margarita fan and I've had lots of terrible ones that are usually on special - this on was a diamond in the rough!) Great service, staff, food, drinks - it's now on the \"rotation\""}
{"text":"My oldest daughter and son in law said they have great wings and they love coming here. It was good! We got the wings with the \"golden\" sauce which is sweater than the regular sauce. I liked it a lot. The french fries we got were excellent. They are clearly fresh cut actual fries. Service was good but not amazing. We told her it was our first time here and asked a few questions but she seemed annoyed that we did. She did keep our drinks refilled. This does seem like it is probably a great place to watch game and enjoy happy hour, we were not there during a game or happy hour but will probably be back for one."}
{"text":"Awful service. Servers disappear and forget everything. I've been there 3 times and all three times the girls have forgotten to put our order in. I use to be a server so I try to give people the benefit of the doubt but they should hire staff that pay attention to their tables instead of learning how to juju on the beat in the Togo area. Also found plastic in my food."}
{"text":"Tonight was rough. Deciding to visit on a whim, my brother and I sat down to watch the hockey game. The waitress was friendly and attentive and quickly took our order. After receiving our drinks, we waited roughly 30 minutes before getting our food - which was after two tables that were seated after us got their food. We ordered two of the Zips wings and we're happy until we looked closer  the chicken wings were very under-cooked. They were sent back and the staff handled it professionally. 

The only saving grace for this restaurant is its quality staff. (Even though we did not see a manager after the whole ordeal)"}
{"text":"Horrible!!! Avoid this place! The service is bad, we never received our food which may be a good thing since i saw multiple tables send their food back. Do yourself a favor and drive across the parking lot to Whiskey Rose."}
{"text":"We've been to Zipps a couple of times...not great and vowed we wouldn't go back-way better food and service at other places nearby...Tonight solidified why we will now never return...Our friends picked the place and we didn't say anything- bad decision! Walked into a nearly empty place at 8 pm and the waitress was pretty quick to take drink orders and then we couldn't seem to get her to come back for dinner orders..Finally places our order of 2 burgers and nachos- not too difficult- but somehow the kitchen managed to take 25 minutes to get that order out! Then because our waitress was so hard to track down we decided to ask for our checks when our friends asked for some ranch to dip their burgers in...BEWARE - this place over charges!! Our nachos came out with nothing on them and we asked for all the stuff it was supposed to have- they brought it all out in little cups but neglected to tell us that EVERY ITEM WE REQUESTED WAS AN ADDITIONAL $.50!! So our tiny plate of nachos that the menu said was $6.50 turned out to be $10!!! When I asked to see the menu the waitress neglected to show me one- since of course I knew what I was talking about and to top it off the manager never came over and was a coward- letting the waitress take the heat! Sad for a place that COULD have great potential- Don't waste your money- Chandler has way better to offer! Given the ratings, it will be out of business soon! Wow- had to report FRAUD- as they charged us more than the receipt!! BEWARE!!"}
{"text":"I have made it to zips many times, and it used to be one of my go to places for a relaxing evening to just hang out, play pool, and have some beer. Sadly, the service has continued to decline. I have had a lot of trouble when they have not put in our orders or forgetting about us while we were on the patio. It's sad because I love the sweet jalapeño burger and their wings. Maybe I'll give it a try again. I would suggest at least going to a different location"}
{"text":"Lots of tvs . good atmosphere but food not the best even for a bar it was pretty bad. 
Go there to drink. Not to eat."}
{"text":"Zipps is the classic neighborhood sports bar. The burgers are great, fries are cooked to perfection and the beer selection is good. There is plenty of room for groups and wait staff is very friendly. Even better, they remember their regulars and remember our favorite drinks and food choices (nothing like feeling very welcome every time we go). PLUS - Zipps is about the only place in this part of Gilbert that is open until 2AM."}
{"text":"I love going to Zipps!  I've been to several in the Scottsdale area but this one is most convenient.  You know what you are going to get - good pizza, great chicken fingers, cold domestic draft beer, sports.  If you are going to do a sports bar, keep it simple, do it right and that's what you got here.  Oh, yeah - Zipp-aritas."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I thought this would be typical sports bar food where the food is second rate and all greasy. But it tastes pretty good. I ordered the barbecue chicken sand which and fries. When it was delivered I thought my theory of crappy food and sports bars would hold up but it actually tastes really good. The fries were yummy. Not the typical frozen flair every sports bar orders. It's still a sports bar but the food was better than most. Price was decent. Waitress was great! Lots of tvs and space. Definitely great for the average sports night binge."}
{"text":"Worst Zipps experience of my life. (I was at the Camelback location for the early games) I felt about as welcome as I do everywhere else on this empty Mill Avenue.  I am returning to AZ for 5 days after moving away a few years ago. I walked through the front door. Two waitresses chatted away without acknowledging me. I walked 15 feet into the bar area. I had a dumbfounded look on my face as there was no seating. I looked at the NFL football above me. A man in with the Zipps logo on his Golf shirt walked by me without a peep. I walked the other side of the bar. Miss  Leany-Poo was working. She continued her lean. She looked very comfortable. I wanted to be as comfortable as her eating some Zipps wings watching NFL football. After receiving no assistance,I sat myself at a larger table. I sat for 5 minutes with a parched throat. Tell the waitress wearing number 11 that I tip better than the students that sat there after me. The polo shirt guy came by and he wound up being the clown manager. He came over and said I couldn't sit there. I hate being asked to move. I am glad hospitality is alive and well on Mill. I am glad hospitality is alive and well in Arizona. Good bye Zipps on Mill."}
{"text":"When you just wanna watch the game in a loud, comfortable place, I can't say this location is going to disappoint. Clutch a giant beer, or one of their zipparitas , and leave in time for the REAL party to start. 

I mean, you could come here late at night to eat, but it's going to be dark, loud, and kinda boring. They've got a pool table and patio, but it's not enough to give this a real dive-bar feel that it's going for. 

The drinks are fine. They're inexpensive, and have daily specials...any reasonable person could get plastered here for under $20, which is amazing. Zipparitas get the job done, but taste so strongly of alcohol, it's reminiscent of a mixed drink 19-year-old Taric would have made at a house party.

The food on both visits leaves much to be desired, as on both my visits it was made quite haphazardly...like a pizza with virtually all the toppings dumped on one side, or nachos with golf-ball sized chunks of unseasoned ground beef. Compared to the other location I've visited (Scottsdale), the kitchen doesn't even try.

Overall, I'm not gonna complain if you drag me here, but please don't make me eat here, or make it THE destination. I've got better things to do."}
{"text":"This place was dead on a Tuesday night but the server was super nice! My friend ordered a chicken burrito which didn't taste good at all. The drinks that we ordered was weak too. It got three stars because of the service because it was good."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FOOD HERE save your money and just drink. The wings are dry, the sandwiches are tasteless and do not come as described on the menu and please whatever you do don't order the tacos, I would compare them to what canned dog food may taste like, if put in a taco and covered with sour cream. The atmosphere is nice and the beer is cold. They also were the only place locally showing the PAC 12 Game but next time we will definitely save our money and walk across the street to eat."}
{"text":"We use to go to Zipps just about every Saturday for what we call Linner, lunch/dinner. Since the price hike it seems that the quality of food had gone down. Fries have been sent out burned to our table, the food has been cold and service isn't always up to par. They do have real cold draft beer though!"}
{"text":"Zipps is my go to burger and wings joint. Their golden medium wings and sweet jalapeno burger is my meal every time! Its a lot of food so be prepared to feel full. It's usually hit or miss with getting a good waitress. Some are super helpful and sweet and others are complete ditzy witches! I don't know, maybe asking for extra sauce on the side is \"too much to ask for\"! It's usually really loud on weekends since it is a sports BAR. They have lots of big screen TV's so its great to go to watch a game. Wouldn't recommend going here if you want a quite place to eat."}
{"text":"Today is my day off so my daughter and her bestie had a slumber party. After much debate they decided they wanted McDonald's for lunch. Which I didn't want. So I decided to go to Zips. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with 1/2 fries and onion rings to go. Returning home i retreated to my room from their mcdonalds slumber party feast to enjoy my own, and when i take off the bun, this is what I found..... Now I'm jealous of my daughters McDonald's burger kuz her bacon isn't burnt. ** not to mention my droopy onion rings 
My perspective $12 later........Worst chicken sandwich I've had in awhile"}
{"text":"I go to the Zipps by my house often (16th & Bethany Home) and although they can be hit or miss on their fries or service, their hamburgers are pretty good.... however, I have been to the Zipps in Tempe twice and both times the burger bun was really dry... really dry. I mentioned to the bartender who then came back and told me that the manager said that the next time I should order my burger without the bun being toasted. Eye roll here. I like my burger buns toasted but I don't like them STALE!! Was there between 11 A.M. and 12 pm 4/18/2018. Huge fail!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  This was not the night to eat out.  This place had an open kitchen late but I should have avoided it.  Ordered a bacon cheeseburger.  The meat tasted funny and even smelled kinda rank when I opened it up.  Someone else tasted it and even he thought the same.  Server did not com back to follow up on our meal when it was delivered only to compound the fact I sat not eating.  Manager did pull off bill after we told the server as he was about to clean the table.  Not a great experience so taking this off my list of places to go."}
{"text":"The food is terrible, every time my friends and I go here for a game they never get my order right. I don't get how you can mess up chicken strips. Although, Kansas (our waitress) and another waitress are always super nice and attentive."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to neighborhood sports bars. They have something for everyone on the menu and also great happy hour deals. Great place to go watch your favorite sports teams. The service is always good."}
{"text":"Come here to hang out and drink, but DO NOT order food here...they did not do to well on their most recent health inspection: https://envapp.maricopa.gov/EnvironmentalHealth/FoodSearchInspection?p=FD-31801&i=0"}
{"text":"This place is TERRIBLE. Came here last night with my co-worker after a long day at a work related trade show. We were in the mood for something relaxed and desperately wanted a drink. We were happy to hear that it was happy hour and margaritas were on the menu! Sign us up! We both ordered a blended strawberry margarita and the chicken finger appetizers. Our drinks came out and we both were like wtf? Normally a strawberry margarita is BLENDED and a reddish pink color. These were not.... All the strawberry was at the bottom and a gross weirdly flavored margarita mix blend was on top. The first sip was like drinking a sugar mix. We had to take our straws and try to mix it up. Once we did that, they were good. The chicken fingers were okay, nothing special. They came with a side of onion rings which were totally over fried that we had to remove the batter and eat only the onions. We had a hard time choosing what to eat as it all sounded good. We both settled on the club focaccia sandwich which sounded very good. Turkey, ham, bacon and Swiss cheese with a garlic mayo on focaccia bread. When it comes out we both look at each other like \"is this the wrong sandwich?\" It looked like a turkey wrap. It was NOT focaccia bread. We asked our waitress and she said that yes it IS focaccia bread. Ummm no it was more like a tortilla bread wrap of some sort. It was so dry we couldn't eat it. We asked her for more mayo and she brought out honey mustard. Okay? Whatever. We used it. Barely. Neither of us could really eat that wrap, it was freaking terrible. And the worst part was that the \"focaccia\" bread wasn't fully cooked. It was sticky/gooey. Not appetizing. We ended up taking the meats off and dipping them in the mustard and eating them. The fries that came with our sandwiches were so greasy and limp, I could barely eat them. Our waitress never came by to ask how our meal was and at the end when we were done she came to get our baskets but never asked how our food was. I imagine she saw we barely ate any of it and decided not to ask so she wouldn't have to hear that it was SHIT. We paid our tab and left her $5. I think that got our point across. Thankfully I will never have to eat here again as we live in Sonoma CA where the chefs know wtf focaccia bread really is and it is NOT a tortilla."}
{"text":"Food was good as always but service sucked. We occasionally get good service there but the food and price make up for it. Katie waited on us and made several mistakes from ordering wrong salads for us to forgetting to put the wings order in. No manager came by to apologies so assuming she didn't tell him about all the screw ups she did."}
{"text":"Moved into this area last February (2016). The first place we found near us was Zipps. Fell in I've with the place. Good food and a drink called zipparita!!!
For months Zipps became a weekly hangout. A couple of months ago noticed the service going downhill. I ordered a 3rd Zipparita and it took a longer time than usual coming. Finally asked server about it and when it came it was melted and tasted pretty bad. Stopped going for awhile searching the neighborhood for other places to go.
But today decided to go to Zipps to watch the early football ball game and try out the advertised breakfast. Get there close to 10:30 and they are not open. After 5 minutes the doors open, we look for the TV where our team is playing. The only place to sit to watch game is a table with 6 chairs.  Server comes and we are told they don't serve breakfast anymore. We go ahead and order a Mimosa which did it look like or taste like a Mimosa. Then we were asked to move because we were sitting at a large table and it was just the two of us. There was no place to move to so we could watch the game we went to watch. I was pissed!! I paid and left!!
In closing I am completely disappointed in this place and do not see myself in returning!!!!"}
{"text":"The good food and cheap beer don't make up for repeatedly horrible service. Simple drink orders taking 30 minutes to fill, server saying she didn't know we were her table even though she already took our drink order. The consensus at our table was that our server was under the influence of something. And what's the deal with the patio? Who's bright idea was it to leave half the roof missing on a patio in arizona? PUT UP SOME REAL SHADE. Additionally, all of the outdoor screens are difficult to view because of their over-the-top housing that hasn't been cleaned and have collected dust on the inside of the covers.

I made a yelp account just to write this review, I can't be the first person to complain."}
{"text":"Golden style wings are so delicious here and their pizza is nice and crispy. Ugh i loveeee it! Reason im giving 3 stars is because i had a bad experience here with their wings before ( they weren't fully cooked ) the manager had told us that we ate the wings already ( tore them apart to see if the same problem was going on with the other wings but we didn't eat them, the meat was still on the plate ) they didn't do anything besides give us zipps bucks to use on our next visit. Thats what kinda upset me. Should have handled the situation then and there. But anyways this place has wonderful waitresses but the guys who manage this place are a holes."}
{"text":"Very nice personal service on patio with Cody as my waiter, and the best Golden Medium wings I've had in forever!!!  I felt it appropriate to give happy note to chef!!"}
{"text":"We recently hosted our Fantasy Football drafts there this past weekend and were treated to a V.I.P. experience in the back dining room.  The manager Jeff went above and beyond as he provided his cell phone for a hot spot since the wireless did work in the back dining room.  The food, drinks, and especially the service was great!  The waitress on Sunday even told a couple that the room was reserved for the draft participants only.  A plus service, we will be coming back next year!."}
{"text":"My girl friend, roommate, and I got to this zipps all the time. We love to get down on some zipparitas. I have noticed that this Zipps really has a family feel and has people from all ages going in and enjoying there food. I have know problem giving them 5 stars. 

The only thing I would say is if somebody from Zipps is reading this there is one issue I have. When something comes out not prefect and its something very small. Like lets use a side of ranch for example. If I wanted ranch and ordered it or did not order it but my meal came out with blue cheese. Don't argue with us over a .50 ranch. Just say ok sorry I will take the blue cheese and bring you a ranch. I feel this has happened a few times here and its always something small but man does it bug the crap out of me. Its those little things that people remember. 

The three of us, with friends and family have spent close to a $1000.00 at this zips easy so obviously I love the food, only place I can get a chambord zipparita and can smoke on the patio. Plus they have great TVs, pool table, golden tee, and shuffle board. 

This is a great place to take the fam, friends, or a date. Be careful with the zipparita's they will sneak up on you."}
{"text":"I love zipps wings but the service stinks at this place. We waited forever to order, our table was never cleared off, we waited a half hour to ask for more drinks and had to go to the host stand twice to see where our server was at to find out she was transferred to a different area of the restaurant so why didn't anyone tell us that or give us a new server. So disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"I've never been to Zipp's and was really looking forward to this place. I came here for a team lunch with co-workers so we had a group of only eight people. 

When we walked in the place it was all decorated with sports and mega tv's all over the place with different sports channels. We were not greeted at all. Found our own table and we had to moved the tables ourself to fit our party which included getting extra menus from other tables and place settings. So it didn't start off that great. 

Waitress came pretty quickly with our drink orders and I had the Passion Fruit Ice Tea. One word for the ice tea. Terrible. Did not enjoy it at all. No real taste. I was hoping this was just an off day. Anyways, I ordered the Mushroom Swiss Burger with Sweet Potato Chips. The burger came with two burger. Sadly, the burger had no taste. Bland. Only thing I could taste was the Swiss cheese and mushrooms. Very uneventful. The sweet potato chips were pretty good. Not too greasy. 

So overall, the atmosphere was great but the food was lacking. Took a while for our food to come out too. So the service was what I would call so so. They did refill our drinks on a timely manner tho. I'm not to sure if I would want to come here on my own again. So your choice. Take your chances."}
{"text":"I have loved Zipp's for years, and have been to their locations all across the valley. I was craving a burger, and they've never let me down before. And was pleasantly surprised to be able to get a table for 3 so quickly with the college bowl games going on; that was a plus. Our waitress came over to our table and took our drink order promptly. When she came back with our drinks we placed our dinner order. 30 minutes go by and our burgers come out, 1 was the wrong burger, the other was ice cold, the 3rd was fine. So, 2/3 of the food goes back to the kitchen as we watch and wait. 30 minutes later the 2nd burger comes out, then 15 minutes after that, the 3rd burger comes out. At this point, none of us were eating together. The waitress apologized and said she'd get it right next time... The food & the service didn't warrant a return visit honestly. I won't be going back to that location again."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago with friends for drinks and appetizers and for the most part the server who wasn't very personable was ok. Service slowed quite a bit but the food was good and our drinks were being served in a reasonable time. Came here today (12/10), sat at the bar, server greeted us quickly, got our drinks and when she brought them back we ordered. My husband got the fish and chips and i got the fish sandwich. Took a while for the food to come out and when it did, food was cold, fried were soggy and when I looked at the cup the tarter sauce was in i see buffalo sauce in it. Meaning one of the cooks stuck their finger in the cup before it was served. I didn't finish my food and am throughly disappointed. The server is nice and has been on top of my drinks otherwise we would have left immediately after."}
{"text":"For North Scottsdale this is about as good as it gets for a sports bar.  Lots of tv's although they could be updated to high definition. Food is pretty typical sports bar food. Decent wings, overcooked burgers. Your typical sports bar beer selection could be easily improved with a few more microbrews."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with their zipperitas.  It's the simple things.  Nachos, green chilli bites, and zipperitas is where it's at!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Zipps many times in addition to 3 other locations.  I know how the food is supposed to be.  I do not know what happened tonight, but the food was terrible.  I got take out this evening.  I live about 7 miles away so I called on my way there.  They told me that it would be ready in 25 minutes.  It did not take me 25 minutes to get there.  My food was ready when I got there.  I ordered two Monaco Focaccias, a cheeseburger and some mozzarella sticks.  I always order the Monaco Focaccia so I know how good it can be.  Tonight it was not completely filled with chicken and it didn't have any cheese in it.  There were several slices of it that were completely empty.  The fries were overcooked, cold and hard.  There was a black curly hair cooked into one of the mozzarella sticks.  Disgusting!!"}
{"text":"Zipps is a regular place of mine.  I most always get the Monaco Focaccia.  Marinated chicken breast grilled, melted mozzarella cheese, and ranch dressing. Served with a side of sweet jalapeno dressing for dipping.  You can get it with fresh cut fried, sweet potatoe chips, onion rings or a salad.  I have also had the hamburgers there.  they are very good as well.  I also love their mozzerella cheese sticks.  They are wrapped in an egg roll skin.  They do good take out also."}
{"text":"All the food is fantastic. We love their wings.  Busy as heck with first football game of the season and we did not feel like we waited long for table, drinks or food. Best Bloody Mary I have had in ages. Fresh chips salsa and guacamole. We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  Pizza took an hour to come our.  Only came because we were leaving.  They still made us pay.   Managers insisted we pay for pizza that never arrived.   I would never go back."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to go for wings and happy hour. Their hot is hot with great taste. Get a side of extra hot if like some extreme heat with flavor. My wife and daughter get the skewers with the golden sauce because they like it a little sweet and not hot like me. My son get the hamburgers which he loves. Also great drink specials to go a long with great food. Get a  ZIPPARITAS if you like a good strong drink. Limit is three but if you can drink three you might not remember the rest of your night;)"}
{"text":"The 4 stars is based on this place as a sports bar. I am not saying the food is as good as other places I have given 4 stars. That being, said I love their Monaco Focaccia! They also have good onion rings, their fries aren't great, but I don't mind them. And this might sound weird, but they have great bleu cheese, I say this because a lot of smaller type restaurants have very bland bleu cheese. 

As a place to watch sports it has a bunch of televisions and they are always good about letting you know which game will be shown where. The service is always quick too, which is important when you are trying to drink and watch a game."}
{"text":"Zipps what is going on? The wings are so small and dry! I keep giving you guys a chance but every time I come here you have terrible blah servers and the food is always cold and then this! I asked for different wings and they said no ... wow! I ordered onion rings and they were cold. Shame I'm done trying"}
{"text":"Love this place. Have been going for years. Never disappointed. Best prices I have seen as well. I'm a wine girl. Don't expect anything crazy amazing with wine...but $2.75 for a glass of wine filled to the top for happy hour....that AIN'T BAD! The slices of pizza are decent for being so cheap, but the burgers...oh so good! I'm not even a big burger fan, but something about ZIPPS burgers is unexplainable. I do crave them all the time. Just get the Zipps burger with cheese and half fries and half onion rings. YUM. Lately the fries are pretty soggy. They taste great, but they need to be much more crispy. Good service every time as well. LOVE this place and my fav is the one on Ray. :)"}
{"text":"My beer was watery and service was not good. Our server obviously forgot to enter our food order into the computer, and never even apologized for her oversight. We prefer to grab a beer and watch sports at House of Brews right down the street."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool for a variety of reasons. Nice staff, lots of sports. They'll put whatever games you want on, at least for me they have. But, here's where they fall short. Order a meal, get a side salad and sometimes they refuse to put it in a bowl. Every so often, someone insists on putting a salad with dressing on a piece of paper in a plastic basket. I mean, seriously. It's a bowl."}
{"text":"I don't really expect anything when I go to any Zipps locations.. I mainly come to Zipps for their wings (golden wings extra spicy, sauce on the side) and nothing else.. they have some stuff on happy hour which aren't bad but.. just stick with their wings.. their service is just okay nothing great.. depending when u go, their good and other times ur just waiting forever."}
{"text":"Best place to go Sunday mornings for brunch and football! Great atmosphere, food and even better staff!"}
{"text":"Waited an hour and 45 minutes for two chicken sandwiches. Not worth it. After two orders of appetizers, chips and salsa on the house, we asked for the check without getting our main dish. For a sports bar there has to be better options!"}
{"text":"This is the worst experience I have had in a very long time. We arrived at 9:03 the server comes over a few minutes later. She seemed a bit overwhelmed but didn't think much of it. Ten minutes later we ordered, two orders of wings and a house salad to come out before. Twenty minutes later I asked our server if my salad was going n the way, in which she responded I don't know. She went on to say this is how it works. We ring in the tickets and they make them in order....weird she found it necessary to explain this to me. A few minutes goes by and she drops the salad off and keeps walking, no dressing delivered with the salad. We observe five servers and a gentleman later found to be the manager walk by the table. A random server stopped by the table and asked if we were okay. We explained what was happening and she went and got our server, whom at this point was someone different. At 9:43 we received our two orders of chicken wings. As they dropped off the wings they knocked over the dressings we waited a long time for. I've been here before and while it is never great most of the people we were here seemed to not care. After it was all said and done the manager says yea I won't be here after Sunday but you can talk to another manager next time you're in. The service or complete lack of will definitely make us weary before coming back. Which is unfortunate since we live around the corner."}
{"text":"Very unfriendly staff. If I am spending my money please take a second to laugh at a joke or smile."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but there is nothing special about this place. Nothing.

I get it. I understand that you have to deal with a bunch of cheap people looking to get wasted off of $20. I get it. But you chose to work here, so deal with it! Don't be mean to those of us who don't mind spending money on our drinks, those of us who appreciate our waitstaff and tip 20%. Be nice!

The food is horrible. Its just god awful. However, thats what you get for going to a sports bar.

Customers- Ugh. You get a weird mix of cheap, lost in the middle of their 20-somethings, and semi-businessmen who want to catch the game after a long day of semi-conducting business. Not my cup of tea.

Zipps, if your waitstaff would be a bit nicer and your customers grew up a little, I might come back."}
{"text":"Horrible service.. food order was wrong, along with drinks! When BETTY the new manager came over to consult us.. she offered a $5 voucher to a table of five! Lol When kindly challenged by her management skills/her decision, she asked us to leave out right! I'm a advocate customer of Zipp for 5 years and this happened to be at a time where I took 4 new customers! Smh! Good luck Zipps Tempe location with BETTY the new manager!"}
{"text":"I don't know why, but this seemed to be the only restaurant open in all of Scottsdale when I was there.  Fortunately, it's a good one.  Fun, noisy atmosphere, and the best onion rings I've ever had."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 stars simply because Zipps is one of my favorite spots in the area. Their service is great, burgers, golden-hot wings and nightly after 8 specials are awesome as well. This is one of those places you start to crave if you haven't been in a while. The only thing I would change about this spot is their patio. It's big, they've expanded, but it's easy to be forgotten/neglected out there. Other than that, when I'm in Gilbert and looking for a good time, we go to Zipps."}
{"text":"I love the zipp on via de Ventura.  I have eaten there a dozen times.  I always order the chicken Monaco.  This was my first time at this location.  The chicken in the wrap was disgusting.  It was rubbery and chewy.  I am not sure if it was over cooked, under cooked or just awful chicken.  I will not be returning to this location or eating chicken again for a long time.  Felt sick for days after.  I requested a refund and never heard back."}
{"text":"Oh goodness I have been here before but it a been a while but the wings are amazing and there is not a bad seat in the house as far as watching the games ..nice friendly staff and plenty of seats even outside by the fire pit"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food and drink at this place; however, the service can be inconsistent at times.   Sometimes it's very good.  Sometimes it's bad.  My Kasey two trips were marred by bad service.  The appetizers came after the entree and I ended up budding my own table cat the end because no one came to remove dirty dishes.  Plus, my server seemed more interested in socializing with Co workers than waiting on our table.  I will go back because the food was good, but my patience with bad service has limits."}
{"text":"Super bummed they raised their price to an unrealistic amount ! This was one of our favorite places because food was good at a good price. The food isn't over top food so idk why the prices were raise. Especially when zipps didn't pass a health inspection twice. It suck but oh well. I guess you guys have to do what you have to do !"}
{"text":"This is my favorite local bar. $6 wings and $4 beers are my go to! Service is always friendly here but I just wish these guys would hire more people in the kitchen. It's very common for me to come here and be told \"there's only 2 guys in the kitchen.\"

With how busy this place gets, you'd think they would add at least another guy back there. 

Other than that little stitch, Zipps is my go-to after work! Good spot to hangout with friends and spend time. This place keeps my repeat business for good prices and awesome service."}
{"text":"Everybody loves Zipp's. 

It's the perfect place to hang out with your friends and have a couple of drinks, get dinner or watch a game.

This location is usually packed on game days though, so if you're planning to come for one, get yourself out of bed bright and early so you can grab a table.  

I've tried to go a few times, only to turn around and head somewhere else when I saw how many people were there.

The food is pretty good, they have sandwiches, burgers, fries, good apps...typical bar food. 

Good drinks specials can be found on most nights too, so check out Zipp's next time you're looking for a fun bar."}
{"text":"By far the worst customer service I have ever experienced at Zipps. we went to sit on the patio at 2 o'clock in the afternoon and nobody came out after 5 to 10 minutes to even greet us. Nobody greeted us when we came in the door as if we were not even there. We seated at a table in the bar and it took about  10 minutes before anybody to notice that we were sitting there. They were not busy at all. I kept turning around and looking towards the kitchen. There was a server that touched the back of a male employee who was not our server.  Our drink order was not correct. And we had to sit around and wait for our ticket. Eventually we had to ask another server for our tickets so we could leave.  Sadly to say I will not be returning to this location"}
{"text":"Blue Moon you saw me standing alone

Without a drink in my hand

Without a mug of my own



Blue Moon you knew just what I would care for

You had a brew I would dare for

Four ales I fell off my chair for



And then suddenly the check appeared before me

The one I wasn't prepared for

I heard someone whisper 'I'll drive\"

And when I looked the moon had turned to amber



Blue Moon now I'm relaxed after my stressful week

With good times with some friends

With some brews of my own








Maybe drunk yelping is not a good idea............"}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if that were an option. Seems pointless to review since management clearly never responds or cares about all the negative and I'm sure true posts about this establishment. First and foremost the smell protruding out of the bathroom hallway was beyond nauseating. Unfortunately I needed to use the bathroom and nearly through up walking towards it let alone going inside. Asked the bartender if they were aware and she said yeah it's been like that for a few days now. What kind of management let's their bathroom hallway smell like 60 people pissed on the walls and left it there for a week. Our first time here so upon arrival (7:52) we asked if there were any specials the bartender said yes and handed us a table tent with the weekly specials. 3.50 for titos is extremely cheap so we ordered that and some food. As we cashed out we were told we ordered before happy houe started and we're charged full price our first round and the food we ordered. Now I'm not a stickler for a few dollars but I've been in the industry  for ten years and if someone asked me the specials and ordered then I would have said oh the specials don't start for 4 minutes just so you know.  Bartenders make better money on little things like that instead of ringing in that extra 3 dollars and not saying a word about it until the bill is presented. But hey what do I know . Food was equally terrible. Nachos were chips and crusty melted cheese there was no layering affect and they had no flavor other than the salsa so dont bother getting the Nachos just get chips and salsa If you need to eat here.  Cheap place to drink for reverse happy hour just make sure you aren't 30 seconds too early lol"}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars. I am sitting in a Zipps right now annoyed and angry. I've eaten at Zipps for years and about a year ago they stopped honoring my request for all \"flat\" wings. I was told by two different managers at two different locations that they had a strict policy to give 5 drums and 5 flats per order. Today for the third time in the last year since they created this \"policy\" they broke their own rules and served me 7 drums and 3 flats. When I informed the manager this was offensive they kept violating their own \"policy\" since they refuse to honor my request, I was told it has never been a policy. I'm done with lying Zipps."}
{"text":"My friend and I came to zipps for the first time and I was not impressed as soon as we walk in the door the hostess didn't great us she stood there texting on her phone looked at us and ignored us so we say ourselves at the bar area our server that didn't even give us our name took 15 minutes to to take out order and I didn't appreciate that she smiled to all her other customers but is like we were a problem for sitting in her section and she had permanent BITCH FACE the whole time the serves us we came to your restaurant on 1/23/16  at 9:00pm."}
{"text":"I am very sorry to report that for the first time in 15 years, we now have a negative opinion of Zipps. Our meal was terrible from start to finish, with the fries cooked into solid carbon, the  server cursing a blue streak with her friends right behind our kids heads. Our replacement fries had a big nasty curly hair in them. We might still try again at some point, but our experience this last time was really atrocious."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! It's has become one of my go to places. They have great choices for both food & drinks during Happy Hour. It can be louder on some days but this is a sports bar, after all, so it's to be expected. I haven't had a bad experience with this place. The servers are always pleasant and the service is good."}
{"text":"We leave right down the street from here and come here often but today I did not like our server Kayla. She was so rude to my son!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time as we visited from out of town and this was by far the worst service I've experienced! Waited 10 minutes to order our drinks. And another 10 for a waiter to take our order.(restaurant was not even busy) as we waited for our food which took over 20 minutes to come out NO ONE asked if we needed anything ( no drink refills or anything) 

Would of excepted my food to come our hot buy my fries were stale as I ordered extra crispy fries!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but a little greasy! Had the BBQ chicken sandwich which was delicious. Fries are okay nothing special. The table across from ours had a cookie skillet that looked amazing. Lots of menu options and lots of good drink deals. Seems like a pretty good spot to get a casual meal and watch the game!"}
{"text":"NOT allowing dogs on your patio, but in the outside of it, makes you decidedly DOG UNFRIENDLY!! Shame on you for the false advertising."}
{"text":"Still does not get better.  I ordered several other items and I was happy to say they were good.

One of the items we ordered was the fried chicken salad. The chicken tasted so horrible. It was burnt. Just a bad taste too. I've never had a salad that I can say had the worst review. This is the worst salad I have ever had."}
{"text":"Needed a break from the norm and wanted to catch the last half of the NCAA game... Had the Monaco Focaccia... The side of sweet jalapeno dressing didn't really move me but what better way to indulge then a half/half side of fries/onion rings."}
{"text":"I have tried the mozzarella sticks and chicken kabobs but honestly i did not like either. But went back to try the wings they were pretty good give them 3 and a half stars"}
{"text":"If I could give a 0 I would and it all has to do with the manager Andy!!  We are paying customers and I sent an egg back because it was burnt and instead of offering to remake it he told me that's how it's has to be cooked.  I wanted a fried egg with a broken yoke and the white part was completely brown.  I cook eggs like that all the time at home and they never have any brown on them at all.  Worst thing was he got into an argument with me about the egg and refused to remove it from the bill!   All of this over a $1.00 egg!  He is an ass and we will never return to this Zipps or any other Zipps for that matter.  I will be putting a call into corporate on Monday when they are open!!  This place sucks avoid it at all costs!!"}
{"text":"Only been here a few times, but no bad experiences. It's a sports bar so of course if you're into sports the game will be on for you. I ordered a pink pussy cocktail and it was very nice! Waitress recommended that I come back in and try the Margarita version with the watermelon too so ++ for recommendations. Had some chicken fingers which were decent. Not to crowded and definitely chill."}
{"text":"It's a good place to drink and hang out but I was there on Thursday May 3,2018 and I was in the restroom and I was wetting my hair when a employee comes by to wash her hands and I kinda splashed her with water and I immediately told her I'm sorry  , the employee gave me a dirty look I feel she could of said it's ok but she looked at me rude. To me that was very unprofessional"}
{"text":"Horribe service from the server and manager. Took way too long to get our food. Don't come here expecting good customer service"}
{"text":"My son and I came in to watch the Dbacks game. Not only was it only on 2 of the 20+ TVs, but they wouldn't change the channel of either of the tvs that were closest to us. Remind me, we live in AZ and this is a sports bar, right?  Ridiculous.  

Oh, we also ordered 2 sodas, at $2.50 a piece, she brought out the sodas and at the same tine said they couldn't change the channel. We said we were going to leave and she brought the check. Tacky, just tacky."}
{"text":"Just returned from a average dinner out. My husband got an Alaskan Amber overpriced even during happy hour. Our burgers were decent. Onion rings not so good. French fries less than average. Server didn't check on us often enough and we tipped accordingly. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"My dad and I come here at least once a week. We don't have cable so we come to watch the Stanley cup playoffs and baseball. The people are great! They always get the games we want to see on the tvs. We enjoy the food and happy hour. This has really been a great place to spend time with my old man. Thanks guys keep it up! Josh is a great waiter! My dad and I look forward to seeing him!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars! I must say, I'm a total fan of their Zipps Golden Wings! Gotta love their reverse happy hour! Ordering their wings on medium is smart move, their wings are already so flavorful and sweet, that its a shame to go any hotter, since you'll mask the inherent, crisp, and juicy flavor. I'd say pass on the Fish Tacos, and if you're in a burger move, order the Jalapeno Burger. Sampled their beer, not bad! 

Breakdown:
Zipps Golden Wings ~ a MUST get!
Fish Tacos ~ Yawn...
Sweet Potato Chips ~ Could do again!
Jalapeno Burger ~ Delish! 

Overall, this is a chill spot with your better than average bar food!"}
{"text":"Today I was told my dog could sit on the Patio with me, but after ordering a beer I was told by Gary, the Manager, that we could not have her there. I was still charged for the beer that I was not able to drink, and told I should have seen the sign. Strong works Zipps."}
{"text":"If you're here to watch sports wth people who are equally as loud as you, sweet - you made it. If you like pizza, this place is basically your personal hellscape. Unless you enjoy a flimsy vessel for 10 lbs of cheese that's been lightly dragged through a bathtub of fryer oil, steer clear. Probably order a sandwich- that looked edible. $4 beers though- so, not all bad."}
{"text":"Finally made it to the neighborhood bar and grill.. great vibe great food and service!! Coming back for a football night!!"}
{"text":"No drink menu, very small and weak selection of beers, very bland food. The focaccias are dry and come in a stale tortilla.  The burgers are unseasoned and bland, it's like chewing meat your 6 year old made. Onion rings and French fries are soggy. The only redeeming factor is their wings, and those are pretty expensive at $1 a piece."}
{"text":"I like this place as it reminded me of back home in the mid-west...all hillbilly & red neck. Oops JK ;)"}
{"text":"The service was good waitress was great, ice ice cold beer, however on 7/31/17 went there with family and dinned in...I ordered the Fish and Chips which is always a favorite. This time I am not so sure. I ate the fish which seemed to be fine, one I tried to enjoy the frys with tartar sauce something did not seem right. I could not eat any more and began to feel sick..we talked for another 10 minutes and I had to vomit! Yes, I ran to the bathroom and stayed like this all the way home. It was not until I ate the tartar sauce.did i feel...not sure if it was sitting out but I was sick the rest of the night..

Not happy at all..always been a loyal customer but with the increase to start and now this I may have to rethink goinf back find another place to watch my aports...I used to love it but the fish portions were small fries were soggy and  Tatar sauce spoiled or out dated!"}
{"text":"I enjoy most Zipps locations but this one has the worst management of all of all Zipps. Truly rude and definitely incompetent. Food is greasy and cheap but a decent place to watch the game over a drink with friends, however there are too many other options around here to waste your time and money at this place."}
{"text":"Food was quite tasty.  Drinks came quickly.  But had to ask for silverware and it took awhile for the server to come by and check on us.  He was polite and friendly.  We will come back."}
{"text":"1st time here, Sally at the bar tended us, ordered chicken skewers, mixed & match baskets, house salad. Ordered a pizza with Pepperoni and mushrooms, received a pizza with mushrooms, pepperoni and sausage. Sally caught the snafu promptly and the manager Shelby came and fixed the situation by offering us a free pizza for a future visit. Knives, forks and wet naps were given to us prior to eating which is a plus.  Bar was clean, lighting was dimly low but that is ok because the location was at maybe 7% capacity. Pizza is thin crust, you save $1 by ordering a whole pizza as opposed to a whole pizza by the slice. Enjoy! Bon apatite!"}
{"text":"Great sports bar with great bar food. The wings are second to none, I have tried all the varieties all are great. Mozzarella sticks are terrific they have a egg roll feel to them. Even the pizza is decent for a bar. Service for me as always been good, though it can get busy during happy hour."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Zips and we were very disappointed in the food quality. I ordered the fish taco and my brother-in-law ordered the fish and chips. My fish taco was an actual fish burrito filled with cabbage and what seemed to be batter bits with some remnants of fish mixed in. There really wasn't much flavor at all. From what my brother-in-law said, his fish and chips weren't very tasty either. The service was decent but you could tell there was some significant confusion in the kitchen as our server was noticeably stressed.

With all that being said, if you like wings this may be a good place for you. They smelled really good. For me, I won't be back."}
{"text":"For the mixture of value and ambience and quality, this is the best sports bar in Chandler.  Their happy hour specials are really good and they have them every day of the week.  This is a great place to watch a game or hang out in a clean bar and play Golden Tee or Shuffleboard.  Their burgers, wings, and foccacia wraps are really good.  They make a drink called the Iceberg that is beer topped off with slushy frozen margarita and those are really tasty.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Is this place actually supposed to be . .  . you know. . . . a business?

We showed up at about 7 on a Tuesday, putting us in the no-mans land between happy hours. That part didn't matter much to me, but as we seated ourselves I wondered if we might be catching them in a dead spot. Maybe that explains the rest of the review. I'm not anxious to try again. At any time.

We chose to sit in the bar area where more of the tables were full than in the restaurant area. We were just there for a couple drinks and some apps.  The waitress shows up and my friend asks what they have on tap. The waitress recites a voluminous list from memory, blandly. However, neither of us could hear her well enough over the Brian Adams or some other droning shit they had playing too loudly in the background. My friend asks to see a printed beer list. The waitress--a bit perplexed--explains that they don't have printed beer lists. My friend settles for water and starts searching \"Zipps Phoenix Beers\" on her iPhone. On the other hand,  I--determined to get my drink on--order up a vodka tonic and throw in an order of some wings.

We wait.

I get my drink. The tonic water is flat as a stretch of Nebraska Interstate. Waitress comes back around. I tell her that it's not working for me and since I suspect that their tonic has gone flat, I order a vodka Diet Coke instead. She apologizes and takes the drink away. A few minutes later she's back with the Diet Coke and vodka. 

Which is also flat. 

And apparently made with \"vodka\" made from straining Sterno through gym socks. 

Waitress is now off in the distance carting around dishes. I try to wave her down. No response. I take it to the bar. Bartender not paying attention. I look back to our table. The waitress is back, but empty-handed. My friend is now searching various blog entries from 2007 looking for hints of which beers they offer besides . . . y'know . . . fuckin' Bud Light, which might be all they usually sell.

I decide to have a beer instead, taking the time to walk back to the bar to look at the taps. I order an IPA.  My friend says \"oh, that sounds  . . . ok . . . \". Ok then: Two. Make it two IPA's. The waitress slowly walks off, carting with her the last abortive attempt at a cocktail and our inspired beer order.

We wait. 

I look over at the kitchen and was reminded of an order for some wings placed way back . . . oh. . . .a couple of screwed-up drink orders before. Seems like sometime back during the days of Weimar Republic by this point.  I notice that although the bar area is well-occupied, the restaurant area is basically empty. I don't see any orders up on the kitchen window. Servers and the cooks are standing around talking. I look at my friend across the table. We look at the bar, and back at the kitchen. No beers. No wings. The taste of two lousy drinks still on my tongue. A gradually-accumulating wave of bitter resentment rising within me.

We got up and left. The Garage was right across the street and was everything that Zipps wasn't this night.

In a word: A business."}
{"text":"I visited this location twice while in Tempe. During the day would be a good start if you would like decent wings. But that positive atmosphere quickly changes during the evening hours. 

First, the wing selection is decent. Nothing earth shattering, but good quality wings. The sides are a bit skimpy and the wait staff is friendly. 

As for the evening experience, you may want to venture to another location. My waitress during the evening had to apologize several times because of the poor bartender service and slow kitchen. This time I brought a friend because of the good lunch service. That service quickly turned sour and habitually slow. After being seated it took nearly 20 minutes to have any waitress to ask what we would like to order. Our mixed drinks appeared approximately 20 minutes later. That was 40 minutes without drinks. Food arrived about 30 minutes after our drinks arrived. This means we waited over an hour to be served wings. There was no excuse because the place wasn't filled with many customers. In fact, many left because of the slow service. 

Typically I would give balanced high marks because of a previous experience. But this location has lots of growing to do if it wishes to compete with a thriving campus community. I would highly recommend visiting for lunch but not for dinner."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and the service gets worse. I sat at the bar for 10 minutes while 2 bartenders avoided eye contact before I finally yelled out for my drink order. These chicks don't give a crap about providing good service. Lauren, doesn't care at all about serving the patrons, the management should tell her that eye contact matters and the customers are ultimately providing her paycheck. Sad."}
{"text":"One of my favorite post-hangover spots in Scottsdale. It's really close to home, dark, chill, and they have great weekend specials. I usually go for the Avacado BLT or the Jalapeño Burger. The service is good, TV's are everywhere, and their diet cokes are massive!

All Zipps are good, this one is great!"}
{"text":"My new neighborhood Zipps is just as good as my old one (Via De Ventura). The food is consistent, prices are fair, servers are friendly and attentive. They also have dozens of flat screens with all the games. We are lucky to have this location within walking distance."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game. Service was great and very attentive. With all that said the food was just so so. We did like the buffalo wings, great spice with a delicious tangy sauce. We were pretty disappointed with the chicken tenders and burger. I'm sure I'll be back for some Bronco games and will give an update to this review if things change."}
{"text":"Love the focaccia's here! Usually a great place to be. Today I am disappointed in the transfer of servers. First server was amazing!! On top of drinks and order. Transfer of servers...not so much . Was left with no beer or water for a good 15-20 minutes. Very disappointing. Other than that - love the TVS and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Zipp's is the typical place you hang out to watch the game or the race, but not the place you go for the food. 

The beer is cold, the young ladies serving drinks and taking orders are very friendly. Too bad they don't have an equal proportion of friendly young men working here. But then again it's a Sports Bar in Scottsdale, not a Gay Bar. 

The Burgers and Wings are well worth ordering and they have some great Happy Hour specials. Just don't order a salad, that's not their specialty."}
{"text":"After spending so much money at this place since its opening, they would not sit my family of 3 to watch football. They told us to wait, and would wear any party of four ahead of us, regardless of how much we might spend. Wasted time, missed kickoff, and not going back."}
{"text":"Came during Happy Hour and it was slow. I waited a couple of minutes to be seated. Hostess was not at the front so I just sat myself at the bar. Paris was the bartender and she was very friendly and quick. She also did a great job recommending items and stocking me up with napkins and wet naps without me having to ask. I tried the chicken wings in the Golden sauce which is like a honey/buffalo mix. They were tasty as were the fries. Restrooms and restaurant were clean."}
{"text":"Love the drink specials. But everytime I go here I seem to get pretty slow service. Good food for being a bar though."}
{"text":"Was out touring some existing project site with a client, and a fellow co-worker suggested we stop in at Zipps for lunch . . . well I have been on this 28 day metablolism boost / energy incresing food plan from my trainer for the past three weeks, so I was alittle worried about going to a sports bar for lunch.

What a pleasant surprise . . . I was able to have the club salad with the dressing on the side, and it fit into the food plan perfectly . . . not to mention that the lettuce was cool and crisp, the bacon was thick with a crisp out side and tender inside, and the amount of other topping to lettuce was perfectly balanced.  The others in the party all had different burgers, and loved them . . . yes the drool was starting . . . especially for the Mushroom Swiss Burger . . . but that will have to wait for another visit . . . damn.

Now, why only four stars if everything was perfect . . . being on the food plan for almost a month had me wondering if it was the lack of restaurant food or if it really was that good . . . I'm betting the latter . . . but I need to come back for that Mushroom Swiss Burger befor I can give this place five stars . . .

Zipps . . . see you again soon . . . only one more week to go."}
{"text":"Classic sports bat.... ordered the wings \"very spicy\" and why say \"very spicy\" it lives up to its name. I was able to eat a few of them before i left and here is when the awesome experience turned into a horrible nightmare. I was on the freeway heading towards east mesa when i discovered i had pulled the classic \"left the restaurant with out the to go box\" So I figured I would just call and have the kind manager give me a voucher or comp the next order. Boy was I wrong..... I spoke to a lady who said she spoke to the manager and they refused my comp and offered me to bust a u turn and come right back. Im shocked that a newly opened store would see the value of customer service. This is a deal breaker for me, with so many competing sports bar's a simple asshole manager and his business degree doesn't realize the impact one person can have on the business. So i hope people read this and take caution on their next sports bar choice."}
{"text":"Been going to this location all football season, every Sunday morning.  Service from Tish is great, she always remembers what we like and how we like it.  
Most of the food is good, but the best thing on the menu is the Monaco Foccacia...yummm!!  The jalapeno dressing with it is delish!  The frys have skin on and are usually really greasy.  They almost seem like they are fried in dirty grease, but they taste good??  The wings are good as well.  The Sunday morning specials are great and it's always a good time.  
The games are all labeled on each of the TV's so you always know who's playing where, before you sit down, which is nice.  All in all, I'd say 2 thumbs up for bar food!!"}
{"text":"Last night was my last visit to Zipps.  Although the servers are incredibly polite, the kitchen staff and organization need a serious overhaul.  The wait time for food is unacceptable.  It took 40 minutes to get entrees, and this was not the first time.

Attention manager:  this is fixable.  The food quality has always been good, but after last night, I've concluded, it's not worth the wait and overall aggravation."}
{"text":"Sadly every zips I go to seems to be the same standard.  After the first I would never go back, but keep getting pulled into them when out with groups and out voted.  

Service here I would rate as poor, even for a sports bar.  

The beer is not very good, yet not very cheap. 

And the food is not good at all.  

So yeah . . . my recommendation is go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The best zips in the valley! The service is great and the beers are always cold. Have a great patio to watch games on when it's nice out."}
{"text":"We were anxiously awaiting our favorite sports bar so once we found out they opened on Friday, we were there for grand opening happy hour. Wings were perfect (golden medium with a side of hot) wife got her fave (Monnoco Foccacia). Food came out quickly and accurately despite being full to capacity and a 30 min wait to sit. Beer was ice cold in a frozen mug. Service was friendly and we were greeted by one of the owners and the manager. Needless to say we will be back as they have consistently served us great food no matter which location."}
{"text":"Golden hot wings are a 10/10. Very spicy! Beware of the habanero!  extra crispy skin, meaty, I have not found better wings.. Monaco Foccacia is amazing too. We love the Jalapeno sauce. Cool off the sweats with an ice cold frosty beer. Happy hour these wings are only $5!"}
{"text":"This is my last visit to this zips!   After waiting over an hour for my wings that I never got the staff was unappglooic.  We kept getting told 15 more min.  The table behind us timed the delivery of their half and half it was only 53min after they complained.  For fries and onion rings.  When I cancelled my order after an hour I was told \"perfect\".  No apologies no attempt to make it better.  After years this is the worst experience I ever had!  I normally would never even consider a tip less than 15% for bad service but tonight was a solid 5% but I still tipped %10."}
{"text":"I give it a 3 because the service is hit and miss and the table and booths are ALWAYS dirty. But food is good. Although the chicken skewers now have a rubbery texture and are not good anymore. One manager said it is because they changed food vendors so just an FYI for you guys."}
{"text":"Wow.... Zipps used to be good. This is the third time in a row that the food absolutely sucked... Sweet potato chips were soggy and tasted like 2 week old oil. The chicken on the salad was was so tough it was beyond chewable. Pizza was terrible. The fries and onion rings were limp disasters. They did manage to not screw up the quesadilla and the waitress was nice. Won't ever come back. This used to be our go-to spot but no more.. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Shelby is the best bartender. Attentive and super friendly. Had a great time and will be back"}
{"text":"Nice, fun place - good food.  Waiters/bartenders are all friendly and attentive - really never had a bad experience in over a dozen visits.  Big, clean, fun.  Restrooms are big, clean.  Can be bit too loud at times (TV volume) but it's a really good place to go...enjoy!"}
{"text":"I ordered wings... Never got them. The server was this blonde girl who had an attitude problem.  I left without eating because at that point, it was past 45 minutes.  I guess they are doing bad, they might really need the 8 bucks that my wings were."}
{"text":"Zippe is very good don't get me wrong. I am a wing person so it kind of was uncool when I offered to pay extra for all flats and they called me back just to tell me that was against policy. Basically telling me to pay for something I prefer not to eat. I'm pretty disappointed I really love their wings! If you're okay with drums than this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I've been to this location plenty of times, it is great to watch the games or even to grab a quick drink. There are plenty of tv's and usually a good amount of seating. Nightly specials and weekends specials are very popular and you can see them on their website. Today I decided to stop by  with my boyfriend on my lunch hour. We ordered the BLT and Chicken skewers, everything was good until my boyfriend started to eat his fries and realized a blue band aid was in there! It was the most disgusting thing I have ever experienced while eating out. I didn't even get to enjoy my full meal because  I was so sick by the sight. The waitress offered to adjust off the BLT but we still had to pay for my meal which I was unable to eat. This is a normal spot for us so it really sucked to find this and then having to pay for a meal I didn't get to eat wasn't making it any better. I only hope that the kitchen staff start to wear gloves esp. when they have an open cut."}
{"text":"Although the golden medium wings are delicious, the service is probably the worst I have ever experienced. The servers stand around talking and don't even notice when a new table has sat down. Then no one checks on you. The service was truly an abomination. Totally bummed because really...the wings were tasty."}
{"text":"This is a great place that we go to every week for dinner and a drink. The Zipparitas are amazing for the wife and I enjoy the 32oz draft beers. All the burgers are really good and go great with the wings.  Along with this the wait staff is the best!"}
{"text":"The wings were great!  The burgers, great!  The chicken fingers, great! The onion rings and fries, great!  Are you sensing a pattern?  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Went in and had a server named Paula... It was the worst service I have ever received in my life. She neglected my family and I the whole time! Very rude too. So for future notice if you have the waitress of the name of Paula, Run."}
{"text":"I used to be a fan but after the last two times of the worse food (take out) we need to find wing place.  
Wings completely over cooked, like rocks... tenderloin quesadilla, chicken sandwich , fries, all ice cold.  When placing the orders the servers always seem super annoyed and condescending (and I mean everytime! You know those people that get super excited telling a customer they can't do something for them?).  Really sad since they are literally up the block from us but obviously the staff and food has taken a serious dive.  Management needs to make an effort and think about their customers, service and most importantly the quality of the food!"}
{"text":"Good food, good wings.  Happy Hour Specials are ridiculously good.  Well done!"}
{"text":"We are regulars and usually have a great experience, however today we went with a group of 8 to watch the basketball game.  Given availability we had to split up into 2 tables.  The waitress asked us if we would consolidate and put all 8 at a table that could fit 6, we explained that we had 8 people total and it would be uncomfortable with everyone eating and she said \"it was her section and she wanted to turn over tables\".  We left.  Look I have been a server before and I get it, but seriously that is not how you speak to a customer.  It was rude and selfish sounding and it came with attitude.  We said we will leave and take our business elsewhere and she gave more attitude. Didn't want to sit and be served by someone who clearly only cares about herself. Manager did come over but we didbt want to start anything.  Instead we are heading somewhere else and someone else will get a generous tip, especially if Michigan wins. You need to train your staff on customer service."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken sandwich blackened, no flavor and the chicken patty was thin as paper. Fries were soggy and cold. Stick with the wings."}
{"text":"Best wings and fries ever! Nowhere else compares, when we want great wings Zipps is the only place that will do the trick! Writing this review makes me want to go there now!"}
{"text":"I've never had good service here. The food is okay for bar food. I used to love the focaccia wraps but now it seems like the chicken quality has gone down and they're always so weird about charging extra for a little ranch. Of course I want ranch with my buffalo focaccia... it's a fine place if you're there to drink beer and eat fries but that's about it."}
{"text":"Always consistent! It's nice to be able to go to any location and know you are going to get great service and good food every time. I love have they have specials everyday. The wings and of course margaritas are a must!"}
{"text":"Zipps anywhere is the best! Great food amazing wings and even better wing sauce options! Love eveerything about this company!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and it wasn't too crowded though there were several tables with large parties, so that might explain the slow-ish service. Ordered the BBQ bacon burger which was really good. The onion rings and fries are both kind of meh though. Price wasn't bad either considering two orders of the above was less than $20."}
{"text":"Just relocated here and was looking for a place as a local sports bar.   Sat at the bar and ordered.   No corona premier....had to settle for ultra.    Come on.    Then I ordered protein style with an egg.      Egg was cooked to within an inch of its life.      Burger seemed ok but they are sure proud of a non seasoned burger.   Finally I had a salad.....\"you want the croutons, carrots, and onions?\"  No thanks.   The salad was covered with, you guessed it, carrots, onions, croutons.    I voiced my displeasure but explained I will just eat around it.  I mean it was just iceberg lettuce.     The assistant manager took it on himself to bring a new salad.   I have a hard fast rule....I dont accept new food in sports bars or fast food because of what the waitstaff does to them.   This one looked wilted and straight out of the trash with a loose saliva on it.   No thanks.   I did tip 20% but shouldn't have because when a bartender or waitress takes an order without writing it down it better be spot on.   Instead my salad was probably spit on.   The search for a bar continues!!"}
{"text":"Hey so... Uhh.. I've been here for an hour and I finally got someone to come over and take my order. Cool.
They get points for showing Friday night fights though, hella hard."}
{"text":"I don't seem to have good luck at zipps had a bad experience at another location decided to try this close to home, I ordered a salad the lettuce was old brown and wilted, when server asked how it was I  was honest she was like clueless, never sent a manager over to say sorry. When she brought the card back she left no pen to sign"}
{"text":"Worst service ever can't believe thAt the server would not tell me that a bigger beer was better value. For a sever trying to raise her check average to get bigger tip she got nothing. Hope she can leave off of 4.85 and hour"}
{"text":"Have a beer and watch the game.  PASS on the food!  Ick.  

We came on a Saturday night to watch the ASU v. Wisconsin game.  The dining room was a deafening level of noise (echo from the volume on tv's) so we sat on the patio.  The waitress was nice and friendly, but it took FOREVER to get our food.  

When the food came it was brought out by someone other than our waitress (and it wasn't that busy).  We ordered wings, moz sticks, chili, salad and a steak sand with 1/2 fries 1/2 onion rings.  Everything came all at once and  was a tasteless mess that wasn't very warm.

The tv's outside were really blurry if you were not looking at them square on.  We left and went elsewhere to finish watching the game.  

Drat, another sucky Chandler restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game if you want to watch with a group. Nice atmosphere, but the food menu needs to be seriously redone. Too many other places around with much better food. If the menu and food quality improved this place could be great! Goldies their other bar in Scottsdale has a much better menu."}
{"text":"Pretty hip sports bar nestled in the phoenix area it reminds me of a buffalo wild wings. They have plenty of tvs and also a jukebox so you can choose a soundtrack to your night. They have huge beers for 4 dollars which isnt bad at all. My friends and I played with their shuffleboard table as well! Not too many sports bars have them so that was definitley a plus in my book. The reason for the 4 star review is that their outside patio could definitley be more lively and it needs some tvs outside. Other than that its a cool place to grab a drink some pizza and watch your favorite sports team."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Zipp's. For what it is/does, the food/drinks is great.

I find it hard to move myself off my regular order of the chicken focaccia. Just can't get enough of the garlic mayo.. I've actually been a fan of this since I found it at Goldie's, pre-Zipps way back in 1994/1995? Same folks...

Also love the cookie skillet. Good beer on tap. As far as a pub/sportsbar, just works for me.

The reason I'm commenting today is that I had a different preparation of mozzarella sticks than I have ever had. Instead of the typical batter on the outside, the mozzarella was wrapped with what I think was an egg roll skin. Looked kind of strange but for a mozzarella stick, it was awesome. Of course it's just a mozzarella stick & if you think it's going to be something transcendental, you're going to be let down. It's a good sports bar mozzarella stick though.

Just had to mention..."}
{"text":"It's bar food, but good. Go there once a week for lunch for at least 6 years. The staff there is just nice, know us by name, and are always friendly. Lisa A.K.A. \"Guacamole\" enjoys her job... it's nice to go to a place where people actually seem to enjoy being there.  Zipps Chandler is Officially APPROVED by the Phoenix Scooter Club!"}
{"text":"We came here before the terrible balloon festival that Julie references in the review below mine, and I was pleasantly surprised. Nice, big salads and good tasting food. Some things are definitely \"bar food\" but there's enough on the menu to be healthy. We were seated at a nice spacious booth that fit four adults and two kids in high chairs quite nicely."}
{"text":"Horrible experience food was cold .... When explained to the server our food got microwaved and reserved to us.... Lame"}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars for happy hour. Repeat this is a happy hour review only! I warned you!

Golden wings and giant beers on happy hour for pretty cheap. I'm always satisfied and never leave disappointed. Aside from there happy hour menu, they have a full menu, but I think they food is kind of eh. For bar food, it'll suffice, but if I'm not drinking or it's not happy hour, I avoid this place.

For some reason, every Zipps has the worst parking. I think everyone that goes there must drive two cars to get there. Parking is always terrible and small. Go early, get a spot and chill. Happy hour is good in the bar and in the dining area, so no worries about that.

Seriously...grab some golden wings and a 32oz beer. You'll agree."}
{"text":"When you order food to go just don't from this place. Probably the worst portion and quality I could imagine. Buyer beware.  Hopefully someone can buy that place and turn it around."}
{"text":"Very overpriced bar rail Vodka Diet Coke, $15 each as they said it was double shot, Naomi and I had five so $150 tab with no food or appetizers...  Neither the bartender or manager were cool or helpful when we said it was excessive.  Offered nothing to get us to ever return or compromise on our formal complaint.  Will not return!"}
{"text":"The four of us went to Zipps five hours before the ASU Washington State football game and we spent the next four hours enjoying the happy hour and eating the food specials....  I had a  large Draft Blue Moon with slices of Oranges and chicken fingers and nachos and after 6 large blue moons, we had to walk off the beer, because we were having way too much fun.....

Friendly servers, loads of TVs and a one great time........."}
{"text":"This is a great break from the normal Scottsdale scene. The bar staff is friendly, the pizza is fantastic (which is a lot coming from a New Yorker ;-) ) and the crowd is diverse and fun. A hidden gem in the Kierland area for sure!"}
{"text":"The drinks, music, and atmosphere are great. I turned 21 July 2017 and it's really the only bar my boyfriend and I go to. However, every time we eat the food (Chicken skewers and fries) we end up with food poising or some sickness where we have diarrhea and vomit at the same time... We thought we might be wrong, but I'm 100% sure it's the food now after 6 months of trying it. We've went to numerous locations and they all have the same issue. If you go there just stick with drinks for your own sake...."}
{"text":"Holy crap these Zipparitas will knock your socks off. Oldtown Scottsdale taste more like a Sonic slushy, these here are straight tequila. Well worth your money ladies! The wings are great as always, get the golden medium. Dirty floors and tables though."}
{"text":"Today on a visit to our closest Zipps location from work , I traveled with 10 coworkers.  We were having a wonderful time.  The wings were excellent as always!  Yet the service was atrocious.  Our waitress came and brought me a bill with an extra drink I did not purchase.  Easy fix right?  No, that wasn't the case.  A manager (Louie) I think told me I would have to pay the bill for the extra drink since he claimed it hit the table, and it was on my bill.  Apparently he claimed another girl ordered the drink and said it was ok to put on my bill. ???  Well, it appears that is common practice because another patron in our group said it happened on another occasion.  Since it was happy hour, it was an extra $4 charge, no big deal.  However, based on principle alone, I shouldn't be accountable for someone else's drink.  So this manager said he would call the police if I did not pay the additional charge.  He did.  He refused to bring the bill until the dispute was solved.  I was avoided for 20 minutes, and most of the group stayed back with me to resolve the situation.  It was $4, lol. No big deal, someone else thought it wasn't worth the stress and forked over $5 to cover the drink.  While the police were there to monitor the situation Miranda came over to say she was sorry for the inconvenience, and it was beyond her control . I explained that we were waiting for a lengthy amount of time, and this extra charge would affect her tip.  She mouthed off something along the lines it wasn't her fault, but she was my waitress.  Why was this acceptable?   On stress alone and the risk of alienating all patrons who visited with me $4 was a risk this establishment was willing to fight.  As we exited the manager who called the police was conversing with them by the door.  The police followed us out.

  It became harassment when we all exited and as I sat in my car getting ready to drive away, a police officer who was there insisted I call for a ride, or an uber.  He asked me if I started the car.  He also said because he was nice he could have waited for me to drive away before pulling me over.  WTF.  Without probable cause other than leaving a sports bar, I was accosted.  Clearly rational and sober I walked over to Starbucks on an adjacent block.  It was $4, I sit here 40 minutes later clearly writing this review.  3 Phoenix Police cruisers have driven by since.  2 police officers stopped in and purchased coffee.  I took it upon myself to offer to buy their drink, and possibly ask questions about the legal limit in AZ.  I had two drinks, and they stated it affects each person differently, and advised me to drink some water before driving off to help clear the system just in case.  I think I'll stay here for another hour or so before heading home, and get some work completed.  Yet, I somehow feel disappointed with how our tax dollars are spent.  We were there to have a good time after a long day.  And we were there without incident for 2 hours.  No food is worth the price of harassment and intimidation regardless of quality.  BEWARE of extra charges on your bills, and have some dignity.

AVOID AVOID AVOID THIS LOCATION.  There are many other Zipps locations that offer superior customer service and management.  But, I must say Buffalo Wild Wings, Long Wongs, and even Applebee's would never have treated us this way.  Disappointed long time customer. 

AFTER A WHILE, golden style!"}
{"text":"After a couple rouds of Golf at McCormick Ranch,, we were hungry for some wings and did a google search for nearby wings n beer type places,, 

Zipps popped in as one of the closer locations, but the bad experience at Zipps in Chandler had me second guessing on this place, but decided to give it a shot.. 

Ordered beer, nice n cold... Food, tried the medium wings,, n I will honestly admit, these are some of the best wings i have had in a long time.. Will definitly be back !!

so good, \"I might even give the chandler location one more shot...\""}
{"text":"We used to like it at Zipps,  great focaccia's, but the last 3 times, food was cold, onion rings and fries were soggy and cold. Aweful experience"}
{"text":"Stopped by with 2 friends to eat and catch up. Ordered so much food that our table was full. Everything was great as always. Medium golden wings, onion rings, and fries are my favs but you probably wont be disappointed with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and my brothers birthday dinner with my family.  They wanted their food.  I have food allergies and have limited foods I can eat.  So normally when we go out,  I have to bring my own food (haven't had an issues with this as usually managers are understandable).  I also bring food for my toddler to eat (hand foods etc).  The manager told me I was not allowed to eat my own food  (said nothing about my toddlers food)  because it was outside food...  I reminded him that they had nothing on the menu that I could eat without triggering my allergies. He still said I couldn't eat my food.  So for my birthday \"dinner\" with my family,  I had to just sit and watch them eat.  I will not come back because they can't accommodate food allergies and will not allow for my to have my safe foods."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times since they moved.  The atmosphere was better at their old location, but they have Guinness on tap now.  The food is ok, standard bar and grill.  The service at the bar is never great.  But I still go here occasionally, so I guess there's something about it I like."}
{"text":"Everyone is very nice except the lady manager. She's unprofessional and uncool. Food is delicious. Zipparitas are strong."}
{"text":"I honestly can't begin to express how amazing the service is here. Nice, friendly, clean atmosphere, and a great place to catch the latest games/sports events, etc. The few times I have come here, service has truly been phenomenal. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"I like Zipps generally. The Phoenix locations have never let me down. The Ocotillo location, on the other hand, apparently didn't get the memo about what a Zipps is supposed to be. 

The food is terrible; entrees are consistently made incorrectly, arrive at the wrong temperature, and are served in meager portions. (Chicken focaccia with a whole whopping tablespoon of diced chicken? Hell yeah!) Fries and rings are likely to be inedible by virtue of the line serving up whatever stale, rubbery and/or flaccid crap has been sitting around all day instead of dropping a fresh batch. 

The service is terrible; it's inattentive and extremely slow. 90 minutes. For lunch. With a handful of diners. Starting wistfully at your empty glass is a way of life here. 

The building itself is terrible; the design of this location is so acoustically bad that you literally cannot hear the person sitting next to you.

Go somewhere else. Anywhere else."}
{"text":"Zipps only gets 3 stars in my book.. And that's only because the zipperitas are soooo good!! They recently added an iceberg drink which seems like an attempt to replicate Jalapeño Inferno's \"amberita\" drink- they failed, big time. If you guys are fans of the zipperitas, you have to check out the Amberita from jalapeño inferno. 

Zipps- if you guys can replicate the amberita I will no longer have any reason to eat at jalapeño inferno. Please and thank you!"}
{"text":"Wish I checked yelp before I walked in here blindly and gave them business.

Hot wings taste like vinegar. Couldn't even get one bite down.

Mozzarella sticks made with spring roll wrappers. No no no. Smh

Pizza slice for $2 was tempting. Nope, even little Caesar's and 7-11 have better pizza. 

Beers are decently priced. 

Service as mentioned in many other reviews was seriously lacking. Completely disorganized and inattentive. 

Never again."}
{"text":"POOR SERVICE BY THE MANAGER (What service?! Can I give ZERO stars?)
The bloody mary was weak and tasted like all bloody mary mix and no vodka. The manager gave me 2 choices with an additional fee.
1. She would sell me another drink and I would have to pay for both, or
2. She would sell me an additional  shot for my existing drink.

End result: My friends and I will never return to this establishment again.

TIFFANI:  THE MANAGER WOULD NOT TAKE THE DRINK AND  REMAKE THE DRINK AS REQUESTED. 
THAT IS TERRIBLE SERVICE & MANAGEMENT!"}
{"text":"Zipp's newest location I believe and the only reason why I have returned my visits to Mill. I have always been a fan of Zipp's and their Zipperita's. Order just a couple and you sure will feel a good buzz! But my favorite is the vodka wells for $2.75 during happy hours, you can't go cheaper than that! They have great happy hour specials and they always have late night specials starting at 8pm with other great deals. Each late night special varies and you can never go wrong with $4 Zipperita's or $4 Fireball shots. Service is fast and friendly. When the big games are on, it does get pack and expect service to be a bit busier than usual. This is always my first stop with happy hour after a long day at work. I haven't been here on the weekends yet but I try to avoid the college binge drinking nights on Mill. I prefer happy hours during daylight (I'm old man) and they are very relaxed here."}
{"text":"It's an average place, and dated. It needs updating, and a little stale.
I had the Tuna melt that wasn't overly impressed. I liked that it was in the menu, but could be more than just Tuna and bread. Maybe a nice roll? Hand cut fries? It was just blah.
I also, am not a fan of people smoking out front under the stoop...I guess it's not really their fault. 
Pricing was Avg, and in line.

One big plus.. Bar staff very friendly, and right there with a drink. Very nice, and warm.

In the end... I'd like to see it get updated, and some identify."}
{"text":"Big place. Great chips & salsa. Very good hamburger & real potatoe fries. Fun music - nice atmosphere. I  that they give u a really large glass of water. Good for young and old."}
{"text":"The tacos were too greasy the pizza was on cardboard and the wings kicked my a**.  If you like really hot wings this is the place to go.  Honestly they taste good too.  I have had lots of hot wings and love hot food but the extra hot at Zipps is INTENSE.  That would be the only reason I would so to go."}
{"text":"Would not accept an ID from a US ally, NATO member, sovereign state. Learn your international relations."}
{"text":"Focaccia's are great, service on 100th street is fantastic, not so much off of greenway-Hayden"}
{"text":"Came for happy hour. Yeyeeee. 1.50 for a slice of pizza. What a deal haha. Can't go wrong with a blue moon, a slice of mushroom pizza and the game is on. PERFECTTT"}
{"text":"I would give it zero if I could. I've never been more disrespected at a restaurant than I was at Zipp's, not only by the serving staff and hostesses, but the manager as well. My party waited for over two hours for a table and we still weren't called by the end of our visit, and when the manager saw that we were visibly upset at the number of tables served ahead of us his solution was to simply kick us out. I only wish I could comment on the food, mine never came and I will never go back to find out. My first and last visit to Zipp's was absolutely abysmal and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone that expects decent customer service."}
{"text":"We used to go here regularly on Sundays for the Chicken wings, which were always cooked to perfection.
Last time we went they were different.  Not near as good.  we inquired with the manager and she said they have gone with another vendor for chicken wings.  They were much smaller and the skins were tough and almost looked like freezer burned.  They were not near as good and we decided it was no longer worth the long trip to go there anymore.  Really disappointed they changed things for worse.  Of course I am sure it was to save them $$.
Also we had a whiny waitress that was really annoying.  She was complaining about work and her personal life.  Leave it home or find another job!"}
{"text":"GUYS, THE SIZE...why did the size of the televisions get smaller?? It's a sports bar!  When the Tv's breakdown, going for the smaller size is insulting to your customers.

July 2012
GUYS, THE FRIES....what are you going to do about the soggy fries?  Customers are looking for hot, crispy fries and you continue to fail in that delivery.  It really takes away from the excellent burgers you serve up.  Update: ask for extra crispy and they can deliver."}
{"text":"I attend Zipps often, however this Zipps on Via De Ventura, was not impressive. I invited a fairly large group of friends to come out Sunday to watch the playoffs. Sitting outside was not an issue since they had TV screens and a lot of tables that were empty. The problem was there were no heaters outside, no wonder it was empty. Now I know this is Arizona, but it gets pretty chilly outside in the winter especially when the area is shaded. Fifteen of my friends left and went elsewhere because it was too cold outside. Dollars out the door if you ask me. I ended up getting a booth inside with a few of us that decided to stay because you can't beat the happy hour prices for food and drinks anywhere else, but I froze my ass off the entire time. 

My service was good with my first waitress, however when the next one showed up I had to flag her down for drinks as well as for my bill. Now if the place was packed I could totally understand the slow service, however it was a lot less empty then when I first arrived."}
{"text":"The first place I stopped upon arriving to Phoenix and Im glad I did. Skip the apps, but the pizza is delicious and the wings are amazing! Everything is made fresh in house and you can definitely tell. The service was quick, attentive and friendly. The atmosphere is a typical sports bar, but definitely clean and open. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"For now, they get 3 stars. My burger was ordered medium, got well done. I sent it back and the second one was medium well, third time might have been a charm, but I refused to send it back a 3rd time. 
Okay, now the reason I gave 3 stars is because the burger was delicious minus being over cooked, otherwise this would have been a 1 star place and a NO RETURN policy for me.
As it sits, it's a toss up whether I will ever come back. If I'm in the area, perhaps, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back. Although the GM did give me gift cards for my next return. We'll see!"}
{"text":"Worse service in the world. I usually don't write reviews but more than once we've had issues at this place. The manager is the biggest idiot to ever deal with. When you manage a place you suppose to be confident and know what your talking about. He has no clue about how to talk to a customer. I honestly do not know how he got the management job."}
{"text":"Went for drinks and game watching which Zipps is perfect for. Really great drink specials and lots of TVs. We ended up ordering the hot chicken fingers w/fries and I thought the chicken finger batter was too thick/sweet and the BF loved them and said they were perfect. The hot sauce is hoooooooot.... but we love hot. The fries were satly hot fresh goodness which is perfect when drinking and watching sports."}
{"text":"Classic sports bar...great bar food (wings are the bomb!!), service is good for food type...it's not a steak house people!!!! Love coming here with friends to have a drink, play pool or shuffle board, and catch up with sports. Fun happy hour specials...come check it out!"}
{"text":"After giving this place several tries, I have decided that I will not be going back any time soon.  Last night I went with some friends for Happy Hour.  I ordered off the regular menu because the HH food menu is quite limited.  I ordered the chicken finger basket with onion rings.  The chicken was good but I didn't care for the breading they use.  The onion rings were cold and gross.  The waitress brought me a fresher batch and they were ok.  But, I couldn't even eat them, everything was so greasy that I started to feel sick.  I never not eat my meal and this was a first for me.  My overall impression of that place as of now is \"yuk\".
I like the outside patio...that is the best part about the place although last night a woman came to the patio with a sign asking for money or food.  That was sad and not something I am used to seeing in this part of Chandler.
Sorry, Zipps...please try harder."}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool.... came here on a Sunday night with a group of friends. There were six of us with five different checks but there was no problems with any of the ordering or billing. I had the quesadilla listed on the appetizer with no onions or jalapenos. It came with sour cream, guacamole, and salsa plus Cajun seasoning and full of cheese. It was very good and filling. Plus it was only $5.50. For desert we got the brownie skillet which I shared with my boyfriend. It was okay but it was too hard...should've just stuck with the brownie with ice cream. Overall it was not bad but not overly impressive. May be back as it is a pretty common place for the group to go. Total before tip was $16.16 for the quesadilla, brownie skillet, and a soda."}
{"text":"We like to come here to watch sports with the sound on but tonight. They would not for a national matchup Arizona vs UCLA due to no real reason... just that is the decision. Music instead. Over 1/2 the bar was there to watch that game.  We drove here past Native for sound.   Not good .  Plus their fries are not good always soggy.  Different choices next time."}
{"text":"I love going to Zipps and all, but the experience I had last night had me question their customer support. I was in there with a friend and we decided to have dinner and a few drinks. I had asked for a 32oz beer that comes in a mug. Mind you it was happy hour and thought it would be nice and cheap. As I was 3/4 done with the beer, I took the glass to take another drink. I immediately felt a prick. I put the mug down and noticed my lips was bleeding. I touched the rim of the glass thinking that ir probably had a small chip. I didn't now feel anything while touching the rim and proceeded to feel the inside of the rim. There was a big sharp chip that had cut my lip. I immediately flagged down the server and showed her. She offered me another one and of course I said no; at this point who would want to drink anymore. She said she would get the manager and she did. After the manager approached us, he apologized and asked me if I was ok. I told him I had cut my lip and he said he was sorry and asked if I was okay. I told him, \"well I think so.\" He offered another beer and I said no. He then said okay. And left the table. I was astonished at the way he handled the situation. He is lucky I didn't call my lawyer right then and there. When I asked for my check, he came with it and said, ok I took the beer off. I was very very surprised that he would think that my cut lip was worth the miserable $4.00 that beer costs. I was not expecting a free meal or anything like that, but a diferente approach would have helped. I was really disappointed. I was a restaurant manager before and I know when some very inconvenient thing happened to a guest during my watch, I would take care of their check. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Final
Four and Zipps is understaffed and service was poor. Will go to another place next time."}
{"text":"Thank you Cristy for always receiving me and Dom with a smile, understanding and helpfulness. Zipps and you specifically saved our night after being treated like crap and feeling rejected by the new establishment down the road (ehem cough Blue 32 cough) After they were rude to us we realized we were wrong for trying...Lol! Keep up the good work, we look forward to coming to Zipps!!!"}
{"text":"To start, I have never been to a restaurant where the entire group had to be there before they would seat you, even though you had a majority of the group there. Their reasoning was that they are missing out on revenue. We even told them we will buy a beer for each of the missing people so they won't miss out... they didn't find that too funny. 

As for our server, she forgot to bring lemons to my friend after being asked numerous times, wrong orders were brought out, and when we asked about one of our beers, she said \"it's probably at the bar\" and didn't bother to go get it. 

Overall, one of the worst experiences I had at this place in a long time."}
{"text":"Love our neighborhood Zipps. It's hopping cuz of spring training and the U of A game on tv. Our waitress Michelle is adorable."}
{"text":"I'll eat chili anywhere!  This day I tried the Green Bay Chili.  I chose this over the Turkey Breast Chili as the waitress recommended it.  It was a little different than most.  I had good flavor with spicey peppers in it and good amount of meat.  I'll definitely order it again."}
{"text":"Zipps is next door to me, so it's an easy choice sometimes.  Love the atmosphere, beer is always good, but the food depends on what you order.  Wings, yes.  Burgers, pretty good.  But most other appetizers are mediocre.  Chicken Rolls, Steak Rolls, and the Chips ans Salsa fall flat when it comes to flavor (very bland).  But I reiterate the wings, which is why you should go, because they are delish."}
{"text":"They would get three stars if it weren't for one thing... SEASONING!!! Everything we ordered was completely lacking in flavor and didn't have any salt and pepper on it. We started with the golden wings that were good, but not great. I ordered a focaccia with balsamic sirloin, mushroom, onion, and cheese. Sounded good, but it just tasted like balsamic grease. I also went with half sweet potato chips and fries. The fries has no seasoning and needed to be cooked a couple more minutes to make them a little crispy. The sweet potato chips were ok, but again no salt and pepper. My fiancé ordered the onion rings, and of course there was not a single grain of salt on those onion rings. The food was disappointing to say the least.

Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, but I don't understand how anyone can run a kitchen and let all of the food leave your kitchen without salt. I wouldn't come here for the food after this experience, but would consider having a couple beers here."}
{"text":"Good burgers and they have can sub veggie patties..good happy hour and prices are reasonable.  Good place to watch sports. Overall solid 3.5 just couldn't give 4"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat on Mill, or anywhere in Tempe for that matter! They make one of the best chicken sandwiches I've ever had and amazing onion rings! I've never met anyone who has been disappointed by the portions or pricing either. The service is pleasant and the waitress remembered my friends and I, our orders, and even the time we came in previously!! Talk about service-and that was on Halloween of all times! I'm incredibly impressed and happy to say I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"They have the best wings I've ever had Golden Medium wings are the only wings I crave. The rest of the food is alright nothing out of the ordinary. Good drink specials. Check website for drink specials and times."}
{"text":"The food is priced reasonably. Although it is definitely Not the most amazing food that I have had. Out of all the sport bars that I have been to it was one of them."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place because I just moved to the neighborhood and it's within walking distance, but after a horrible experience I will never visit again.  This was my first visit to any Zipps.

I went in with my girlfriend and we each ordered a beer (one 32-oz for me and one 16-oz for her).  Since we were just a little hungry, we decided to order a single order of fish & chips to share.  

When the food came out and we received what looked to be two full orders.  I asked my server (Jordan) why we received two when I only asked for one order.  According to the manager there is a split charge automatically applied of $2 which was not communicated verbally to me by the server, but is apparently noted in super tiny print at the bottom of the menu.  This charge includes providing an extra side which I didn't want as we weren't that hungry.  This charge does not apply to appetizers for some reason, only entrees??

The manager explained the charge exists \"so that customers don't take advantage of the low prices\".  I'm sorry, but any business from a customer is good business and I've never seen the parking lot of this establishment full.  If a $2 extra charge for people sharing an entree is what makes or breaks your business then your prices are not set correctly to obtain the necessary profit margin. I have 3 years of restaurant management experience and this just seems ridiculous.

I requested a side of chipotle mayo with the fries and received Thousand Island dressing instead.  Our waters were never refilled by the server when obviously empty near the edge of the table, the onion rings were very hard, and the fries we received were cold.  The fish was the only redeeming part of the meal which was actually quite delicious!

In an attempt to rectify the situation, the manager offered a free side salad. The salad we received had wilted lettuce and did not taste fresh.  I would have been happier if the $2 split charge was just removed rather than giving me extra food I didn't really want."}
{"text":"I had a few hours to kill and was looking for a place to check in on Golf Channel, so I picked Zipps after hearing that the Golden Wings were \"to die for\". They were really good - meaty, crisp and juicy, and I found the medium sauce fit the bill nicely. The staff is really nice and friendly and I never had to wait long for anything I asked for. I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied. If I'm ever out that way I won't hesitate to stop in again."}
{"text":"This review is mostly for the bartender Sara!
You made our night!
It was a busy Thursday night and we called ahead to make sure this location had the mega touch game.
Sara greeted us with a smile and quickly poured out drinks.
She took our order and everything was done exactly as we wanted: cheese sticks, wings, fries, etc. Sara was on point on everything.
Thank you so much and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I've been back to this zipps a few times since it's grand opening. I have to say it has improved. Amazing customer service at the bar area if you get Jason as the bartender. He took care of everyone in my party, learned each of our names, and got our order right. He remembered I was allergic to onions and made sure the pico de gallo on the nachos was put in the side. I will only sit in his area of the bar just to get this kind of detailed service. Thank you for proving me wrong the first time Zipps. I will definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"ZIPP-A-RITA's!!!!
For those of you not in the know, at Happy Hour, these are tiny little $3 glasses of concentrated fun! Hooray!

Not much of a manly drink, but will definitely knock you on your manly ass. I guess that's why they limit you to 3, or is it 4 ( Uhhh - can't remember. Damn you zipp-a-rita!).

Everything else is at least average for a sports bar, but the the food quality is slightly above IMO. 
FYI- A new Zipps is being put in at 59th Ave and the Loop 101 this summer, which is way closer to me. Can't wait for it to open, so I can become a regular zipp-a-rita-holic."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout very busy. Took about 15 minutes longer than quoted on phone. Wings are consistently good."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Food is not good... Wings are okay... Service sucks. Ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with no onions they left the onion and left out the tomato...server unenthusiastically apologized. Still was charged for the whole thing. Game watching is good since they have a lot of TVs."}
{"text":"My family went there to watch March Madness and get quick bite to eat.  My husband raved about their beers and he said the food is ok so my daughter and I decided to give it a try.  I ordered fish and chips, my daughter ordered a burger and onion rings, my husband ordered sandwich and onion ring.  We waited long time to get our drinks and food.  When we got the food I was very disappointed.  My fish was so greasy that I had to blot out the oil on my napkin which soaked my napkin.  My fries greasy and when I picked it up it was limp and very salty.  My husband gave me his onion rings and it was same as my fries (greasy and salty).  It looks to me they just dropped the fries and onion rings for few seconds and took it out.  My daughter said her burger was worse than Mcdonalds burger.  I had to flag down our waitress as she never came by to see how our food was and told her the fries were uneatable and would like a sald instead.  I only asked for olive oil and lemon wedges and my daughter asked for ranch dressing for the burger.  The lettuce in salad was wilted.  I was only able to stomach couple bites.  When we finally got the bill she charged us for the Ranch dressing.  When I sent e-mail to Zipps the response I got was that they have the highest quality food and the prices area very reasonable.  It is customary to charge for side of Ranch and that they hope I would give them a try again.  I don't think so."}
{"text":"Zipp's is our go to spot for Sport's in the 'Tuk!  They are at the top of my list of places with the best ranch dressing, it sounds like a funny thing to say but wings with homemade ranch taste so much better than the stuff from a tub.  There are few things on their menu that I am not a fan of, but you can't go wrong with their wings, motz sticks, green chili chicken rolls, fresh cut French fries, or burgers.  They also know how to treat their patrons with 3-7 Happy Hour M-F, Nightly specials from 8-Close, and the Weekend Hangover from 11-4 PM.  They have a great beer selection and Ziparitas are my go to drink order.  You can lose a night here watching a game, playing pool, Golden Tee, or shuffle board."}
{"text":"Great location, in terms of proximity to home.   They have a great happy hour, so we'll definitely be going back for that.   One of my friends order the buffalo wings and found it to be a bit chewy, so not sure if that's a good one to try.  I only have tried the pizza and fries so far. 

I have a feeling I'll be back to watch some NBA playoffs since there are TVs on every wall and more.

Must order during HH: Pizza piled high with jalapenos!"}
{"text":"You disappointed me today zipps! Maybe it's because I'm hungover. Wings didn't come out as ordered and they messed up my sisters fish tacos. Pretty sure it shouldn't be a burrito like wtf? Lol. Onion rings were absolutely disgusting. Poor service in general from supporting staff. Sad day to drop that many stars. Lol."}
{"text":"I wasnt expecting this place to be a Fairmont reunion site, but it was a pleasant surprise, it seems like a lot of my co-workers go here, quite frequently, and it just reminds me of the local bar scene. 
The drinks are affordable, theres a smoking section on the patio (yessssssss) and the appetizers are worth trying. The service can be hit or miss, but I'll definitely be checking this place out again."}
{"text":"Came with a big group and still got seated in a decent amount of time. Ordered the Scorch Focaccia and I gotta say it was absolutely great. Zipps loses the 5th star for one reason: the fries were absolutely atrocious - like leftover fries you'd warm up in your microwave. If McDonalds and Arby's can get fries right I expect everyone else to be able to do them."}
{"text":"Service is always good (@ this location)!! I love some of the new menu options. But to raise your 'signature' items such as your wings by $3+ dollars overnight is ridiculous!!  Price & quality is what get people in your door...THEN they decide if you've won them over or if they can get something similar elsewhere. In AZ, wings are wings. The sauce is better some places, the flavor is better others, the char is spot on or not. ZIPPS wings are GOOD, they are CONSISTENT. ...but they aren't SPECIAL.  They don't demand an $11 for 10 wings (not even a full dozen) price! If you raise the price by $3+...what have I gained by buying it?? If the answer is nothing, it's the same...then I'll order the $2 substandard pizza slice instead. Food is food. If I'm not paying for \"special\" taste/experience, then I'll go for cheap.

Get smarter Zipps owners. You had a great thing and you ruined it out of greed. If your costs on wings go up, lessen your menu and raise cost on less popular items. It's business 101"}
{"text":"Top 2 FAVORITE WINGS in town. 

Get them XT CRISPY and wet in their golden medium or golden hot. Wash it all down with a 32oz beer. Usually the wings are perfect; on occasion I have gotten their wings and there is not nearly enough sauce on them. If you order take out I would ask for XT sauce bc you don't want to be disappointed once you're home. That being said, if you order more sauce you will be charged for it.

Chicken skewers are delicious and the fries are good. 

ENJOY."}
{"text":"I've been in here a handful of times, but today I finally tried the food. Usually I just have liquid dinner to build up my liquid courage. ;-)

Service is always great in here. The cocktail waitresses and bartenders are on top of their game. After all, they're there to make money and want to make you drunk and happy.

I'm a little disappointed with the food though. Yeah it's a sports bar and I shouldn't have expected much. But sports bars all over the valley are upping their game! Zipps really needs to keep up. Everything is served in baskets. Are we still in the 80s? I never understood why that was a trend. I get it if you're ordering discounted happy hour food. For a regular $10 to $12 sandwich though, give me a plate please! I had the chicken burrito which was very tasty, although it was stuck under a heat lamp for a while because the tortilla was a bit crunchy. I was uber disappointed with the chocolate brownie sundae. Super bland and drizzled with caramel sauce, not chocolate sauce. Bad flavor combo!

Score is a 3.5ish out of 5, although I rounded up because service is never an issue."}
{"text":"Was back in on Monday. Ordered chicken skewers and they were rubbery. Green chili chicken rolls were good but dipping sauce had no flavor. Service good once again...but that bathroom. The ladies room smells like you have a sewer line problem! Gross! Next time, no beer for me so I won't have to use it!! Wait, no beer? I need to rethink this...."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Is A Great Time they have a regular happy hour as well as a reverse happy hour which is almost directly after I prefer the drinks Grateful Dead Is  Delicious"}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar right now . And I do believe the bartenders are bothered by me and my friends mere existence. Horrible service with attitude"}
{"text":"It was all around bad experience. My brothers and a few friends went I on a Monday around 5 pm,not many people. Service was ok ,beer was beer. The food was meh. The worst part is the volume of the music. We were sitting at one table 5 of us literally yelling to hear each other. We asked twice if they could lower the volume. Didn't happen. We left and will never return. If you want areal sports bar experience or vibe, Native on Ray and 51st or go where CKs on Chandler and 42st. We've been going to those two for years but thought we'd try this place. Mistake,Big Mistake."}
{"text":"Decent Zipps, but I prefer the brand new Glendale location with more TVs."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good and we were able to grab a seat near several TVs. It was the perfect mix of not too empty and not too crowded when we went.  Food is the same as every Zipps, sorta like a Denny's.  More expensive than a Denny's though."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Zipps.  But that still doesn't say much for me.  I got the black and blue burger and I think it was a joke or something because all it had on it was a hamburger pattty and blue cheese dressing. Lol.  It's suppossed to be lettuce, tomato, cheese, blue cheese crumbles, onions, etc.  It was pretty comical.  Also our server seemed hung0ver or something and that made it weird.  They did have a lot of big TVs and the NFL Sunday Ticket which was nice.  We sat right below a TV though so this one group of people appeared to be staring at us but really they were just watching the game."}
{"text":"So a friend and I decided to hit up this place today, because our original plans for the area were hindered by an early closing time, maybe next time. Typical sports bar place, tons of tvs, full bar and many men unloading after a long day of work. It was clean and the booth we sat in were comfy...

Now about the food. I had the regular 'Hot' wings, at this place, and I will sadly say that the mild wings at Hooters we're way better an those were boneless...Normally, when you leave the meat on the bone its suppose to keep the meats moist and juicy and this totally was not the case for these wings, they tried and failed, but they were no doubt Hot, it burnt my lips and my tongue to the point of just giving up on them entirely.

My friend had a burger, which he enjoyed, but didn't care too much for the fries, which to me, weren't terrible, but they needed more umph for me to be considered good fries. I think about the only thing that I was stoked about was the dirty martini I ordered, it wasn't bad but it wasn't something that would keep me coming back for more.

So yea, good service and waitresses we're nice! But 3 stars because, I wasn't wowed, everything was just so-so."}
{"text":"Zipps has great deals every day of the week and almost all the time. Great drinks and food - service is decent, most of the girls are young students trying to earn their buck. They're not top tier service but they try their best to give the best service possible. Keep in mind this is a sports grill so the food is bar-style. Don't come here expecting top-notch service and cuisine but if you're looking for a good time it's one of the best spots. I would highly recommend for anyone looking for a casual and fun place to eat, drink and/or watch a game. Their zipparitas are the best ($4 on happy hour) and they have nearly a dozen flavors!!! :)"}
{"text":"I will never come here again! The food was greasy and cold. I had the fish tacos which came out in a flour tortilla like a burrito, gross. We had onion rings that were cold and soggy"}
{"text":"Service was ok. Food was poor. Drinks were very watered down.  No alcohol. Even asked for a double. The only thing that was a double was the ice and the price."}
{"text":"A sports bars that doesn't play game audio for playoffs. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else. They would rather charge people to play horrible 80s songs than be a true sports bar."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for helping me find another great happy hour place! =) 

This place got really good reviews for their happy hour so we wanted to check it out and of course we were not disappointed. Their happy hour is from 3-7 then 8-close so it was extremely packed when we got there. 

Here is their happy hour
$1.50 slices of pizza
$3 margaritas
$2.75 house wines & wells
$4 chips and salsa
and so much more!

We got the pizza, chips, and margaritas & they were all so amazing! The margaritas are small, but holy fudge they were soooo strong for their size! I got the watermelon which was extremely tasty. The pizza was good especially for a price of $1.50, and the salsa was actually really good. It comes with a guacamole dip and regular salsa which was very fresh. 

Our waitress was very friendly and helpful with everything and gave us her recommendations on what was good. And the best part? It's down the street from my house! lol. I can't wait to come back here for happy hour again. =)"}
{"text":"Best damn wings and coldest beer in town. Don't be surprised if one of the owners pulls up a chair and sits next to you (it's happened to me twice)."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. The service was great. The prices were very reasonable. I will be going back for more wings & mozzarella sticks."}
{"text":"Honestly, not bad. The bartender Ryan was super helpful. Came here post-shift (late night) for some grub and a beer (which turned into a couple shots and a beer). My friend ordered me a Dos Equis with a Zipperita topper. It was good, made the beer kinda like a slushy. To eat, I ordered the Buffalo Chicken salad. Besides drowning in sauces, it was a decent salad. I would go dressing on the side next time. The buffalo sauce has a kick to it, delish though. It's a nice space with a couple decent pool tables. Hung out on the patio mostly so can't say what the rest of it looked like, but it's definitely spacious. Overall: chill spot, awesome employees, decent bar food, and killer daily specials. Go for late night!"}
{"text":"Some good patio sittin' in the non smoking section. I love the 90's throw back Alt Rock musical selections. 
This place is clean and the menus aren't sticky- food crusted disgusting and the benches aren't scary to sit on like their camelback sister location. 
The service is decent and our drinks were never empty. I like the happy hour & reverse specials but didn't like the price increase a few months back (maybe it's been a year?) :("}
{"text":"Being in the restaurant business for over 18 years I have seen my share of bad employees and management. This place is in the top three worst places that I have been here in Phoenix. We sat on the patio for 12 minutes while four servers and a manager walked by and didn't say anything to us. I finally stopped one of the servers to get menus and she tossed them on the table as she walked by not stopping at all.  It's apparent that owners and management don't review sites like yelp or they would see that the majority of the reviews are about their horrific service. Just a heads up that the restaurant business is the \"hospitality\" business. They haven't figured that out here.  I won't be back!  Food is mediocre at best unless you have really low standards."}
{"text":"Worst place ever!  I went with my mom specifically to watch a football game one evening recently.  We arrived an hour and a half early and were told that we could watch our game on the television there.  After waiting all that time and spending a lot of money on drinks and marginal food and being moved to a different table, some big spender apparently came and booted us out the manager lied and said he could not get the game on the television the reason we know he was lying is because it was on CBS!  If you want to be treated like a total idiot go subject yourself to their lousy menu."}
{"text":"Best wings on mill. 100x better than hooters in my opinion and the atmosphere during any sporting even is unmatched. Great grill, even better bar."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Only ordered a few drinks after doing some shopping in the plaza. Kind of surprised they don't really carry any local beers. We didn't order food however the food going out to other tables look good. Not sure if the server was attentive or annoying!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service...but this is the best part: I'm an AZ native and ALWAYS have to police the tv channel delegation at local sports bars.  On a night with cubs/Dodgers competing with ASU/COL along with Ohio st/Wisc, and the Coyotes home opener- zipps staff was on point!!devils got priority with tv and audio and they put the coyotes game on a tv as well.  They also adjusted audio at halftime and back in second half.  Well done! AZ sports fans must support Zipps!"}
{"text":"The food is decent but the Ziparitas are amazing. Great place to hang out...play shuffleboard, pool and chat. Im a fan!"}
{"text":"We return to watch sports, and eat burgers and wings. Our favorites are the black & blue burger and the golden medium wings. Service can be hit or miss, but we come back for the wings and burgers. Cheap draft, awesome after 8pm daily specials, as well as happy hour. They have 2 pool tables and shuffleboard."}
{"text":"Zipps is one of my favorite places to grab a beer and watch a game!  Let's appreciate Zipps for what it is:  a sports bar with decent grub (not a foodie dinner destination).  I'm a complete sucker for the specials that Zipps runs.  Here are my personal favorite highlights from their deals menu:

Happy hour weekdays from 3-7pm:
$6 Wings (my favorite are the \"golden medium\")
$2.75 well drinks
$3.75 excessively large domestic drafts

Also, there are daily specials from 8-close.  (So let's think about this:  during the week there is a special going on from 3pm-close except for 60 minutes between 7-8pm, awesome, right?!?!)  

My personal favorite day for the evening specials is Tuesday for the Zipps burgers.  On Tuesday from 8-close the burgers are $5 and $6.50 for specialty burgers.  These things are friggin' huge.  Every single one comes with two patties. Monday, Wednesday, and Sunday highlight $1.50 pizza slices.  I think they are \"meh\" as they are just slices with whatever toppings you add that are popped into an oven and reheated for a bit.  

My favorite specialty burgers are:

GREEN CHILI BURGER:  A double stack with pepper jack cheese, New Mexico green chilies & green bay chili on the side.

CHICADO:   Two ground chicken or turkey burger patties, pepper jack cheese, fresh guacamole & fried onion straws.

HOT & SWEET:  Pickled jalapenos & our hot but sweet southwestern BBQ sauce, creating the hot but sweet contradiction.

I often find myself in recovery mode at Zipps for the \"Weekend Hangover Special\".  From 11am-4pm specialty burgers are on special for $6.50 and bloody Marys are $4.  The Bloody Marys are nothing special at Zipps--this is one part of Zipps that has room for improvement.  Give me some more pickles, cheese, peppers, other accessories, pretty please!  Buckets of beer (5 long-necks) retail for $12 during this time too--they are also essential to the weekend hangover recovery, so go for it!  ;)"}
{"text":"Big fan of most zipps, but this location struggles.  Tonight, my daughter and I waited 30 minutes.  Then after watching 4 groups that came in after us get seated before us, I asked if we were forgotten.  I was told that parties of 4 took a priority over our party of 2.  I understand it's a football night and a party of 4 brings in double the tab of a party of 2, however, that is horrible service to say that the party of 2 takes a less priority.  Will never visit here again."}
{"text":"The management at this zipps needs to be more engaged.  If I order take out or eat in, the food is always sitting at the window for long periods of time.  It's not the same experience that I have at other zipps."}
{"text":"This place is sooooooo terrible. Food was terrible and management was terrible Joe and Brandon dont know how to run a place. Soooo terrible."}
{"text":"OK, we were here on a night of the Phoenix Open, so maybe this wasn't typical. 

They were slammed. It took an hour and 25 minutes to get a few burgers and some wings. Fries were cold. Server said she would get some hot ones from the kitchen. I finished the burger. She checked on us, asked about the fries, apologized, said she would check on it. Fries never came. I got the check. No comps or discounts, which any place that cares would do under the circumstances. 

This wasn't the worst part. When we first arrived, our server explained that her manager was requiring the wait staff to take credit cards from the customers before taking orders, because some people had stiffed them the night before. Remember: the Phoenix Open was going on. Zipps had set up a shuttle to and from the course.  So, they bus over people who have been partying all day at the 16th Hole and then--surprise!--one or two of them stiffs them. And their answer is to make their locals leave credit card imprints? I'm a 50-year-old dude. I was there with my wife and teenagers. We weren't in the bar and I didn't even drink. Am I really going to walk out without paying? Why not take a thumb print or demand blood so you can run DNA. 

Tips for Management: (1) if you're going to bus people from the Open, staff up to handle the crowds. (2) The Open is notorious for drunkenness and debauchery. If you specifically target its goers, you're going to have some rambunctiousness. Don't take it out on families. 

Burgers and wings were good and reasonably priced. Fries looked like they were probably good when hot."}
{"text":"Who`s playing? Cubs and Packers.  Thanks.  I'm just here for breakfast with Dave..  Emily and Rachel are awesome with extra napkins and tidying up a bit.  Breakfast was you will not even believe this but the potatoes were fried with onions and green peppers.  Yummy! We met some fun people at the bar.  A very nice place with good service in the hood.  Good job!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice quick service! 

Perfect spot for a nice low key lunch break! I had the club salad! Tasted great! Charged me $.50 for extra ranch which is a bit cheap in my opinion but at least the salad was good. 

The gentleman next to me at the bar also asked for more dressing saying there wasn't enough which I agreed! Maybe they should be a little more generous with their dressings."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on the corner of Via de Ventura and Hayden, tucked away in a moderate sized strip mall. Zipps has a bunch of other locations throughout the Phoenix area, each of which with a pretty similar look and feel. The interior of the restaurant is your typical sports bar/restaurant. Televisions playing sports and a level of noise you'd come to expect from a bar. I've been to this restaurant 3 times and have had a very similar food experience each time. Two of the times were take-out and once was dine-in. I sat at a booth for the dine-in and let me say, it was less than comfortable. The wooden booth was slightly less comfortable than a park bench. The waitress had a bit of an attitude, but it seemed a little more directed to her work conditions than necesarily our table.

Over the times I've been here, I've had the Buffalo Chicken salad, the Monoco Focaccia and the Greek Chicken Salad. Their dishes are much too salty and many of the things were soggy. The Buffalo Chicken was so soggy it wilted the lettuce. The Focaccia and fries that came with it were soggy as well.

I'm sure Zipps would have been an entirely better experience had I been there with a bunch of friends, tipping back some drinks. In reality, I was there because I was hungry. Each time I've been disappointed by the food, so I would pass unless you're there to watch a sports game and tip back a few."}
{"text":"Great sports bar chain in the Phoenix area. Nice happy hour & late night specials. Their wings were fantastic. Lots of TVs, pool tables, shuffle board, & Golden Tee games to play. Standard bar food, wings, nachos, burgers etc... Good spot to hit up in Phoenix to grab a few ice cold buckets of beer."}
{"text":"Dylan and Kristie were awesome, we had some confusion with are drinks and they were very helpful in sorting it out. They rock and provide awesome service."}
{"text":"We end up here for happy hour every time we come to town.  This isn't hard to do because there are very few times when it isn't happy hour!  Happy hour (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zipps-sports-grill-gilbert?select=Cg2nS620f_2PGGURRIaSBQ#8v17XvtYO3bD7YJf5NQgUA) M-F 3-7pm, Sat & Sun 11am-4pm, nightly 8pm-close with various specials (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/zipps-sports-grill-gilbert?select=Cg2nS620f_2PGGURRIaSBQ#H4Dm_6EeG8kns9EVvPH_cw).

All of the tables have seemingly brand new, full ketchup and mustard bottles which is so refreshing (although we were there at 11:30am)!  I hate when I'm eating bar food with my fingers and have to touch some bottle that looks and feels like it has been touched by hundreds of other people who were also eating with their greasy hands!  GROSS!

Overall, a good sports bar with lots of TV's, lots of drink specials and some food specials.  Cleaner than a divey sports bar - YAY!"}
{"text":"This Zipps continues to decline in quality of service and unfortunately the quality of food.  We came in March 3rd for dinner. We ordered 2 dinners and a appetizer.  I asked that the mozzarella sticks come out first as an appetizer. My girl friend ordered the bbq bacon burger and I ordered the chicken fingers with half onion rings and half fries.  

A good amount of time passed by and I knew something was up, I knew the mozzarella sticks where coming out with everything else. No biggie I guess right? It's just a sports bar.  Here's the even worse part.  Our server Alexis A. Comes with all the food and also has a to go box and says \"I messed up and put these in as to go\".  How does that happen? I asked for them to come out first. Lmao. Unbelievable right?..Hey it's just a sports bar, we as the guest should put up with this type of service right? I told her we didn't want them and in that brief discussion we didn't even look at our meals.  The bbq bacon burger had no bbq. My chicken fingers only came with fries, missing the onion rings. Chicken fingers were severely over fried(dark brown).  She brought a side of bbq sauce so I guess now it's a complete meal right? Lol. Looking at the receipt she did not enter the correct item.  All in all what a big joke.  You would think that with all the mistakes a manager would come over?  Not one manager in sight nor did we ever see one walking around doing quality checks.  It's a sports bar I get it, but is ridiculous.  We frequent a great deal of Zipps around the valley but this ones decline is unacceptable."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. Their menu isn't the greatest and if you're a vegetarian or vegan.....well, you're kinda SOL. I ordered the \"greek\" salad. I say \"greek\" because it's far from it. Greek salads are supposed to be romaine lettuce, feta, pepperoncini, and kalamata olives at the very least. This place took a mixture of romaine and iceberg and tossed it with neon yellow pepperoncinis and black olives. Black olives! Really!? That's not a Greek salad. 

They seem to have really great drink specials. Go there for that, not the food."}
{"text":"Just stopped in at 1:15 pm on a saturday.  Not yoo busy.  We were told to seat ourselves. We sat there, 1 table from the bar.  No one brought menus, stooped by even though all 5 servers walked by multiple times.  I would rate drinks - never got any.  Would rate food but never got menus or food.  When we finally left all 5 servers we at host desk talking.  Worst service ever!"}
{"text":"When I moved to AZ about 5 years ago, this Zipps was just down the road, and one of my regular hangouts. My friends and I had such a blast coming here on Friday-Saturday nights for wings and Zipparitas, or the huge 32 oz beers that are way too big, and also when craving burgers and fries.(my faves are the green chile and mushroom Swiss) The onion rings are really tasty as well. I still come back here every once and awhile when I need a chill fun place for drinks and food with my chandler friends and definitely recommend it if your in the area."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends on a Friday night for dinner and drinks. Even tho it's crazy hot, they have an awesome misting system on the patio, so we made a dive for the last open table. Happy hour was ending, but we were able to order a zipparita just before, and kept them coming. These are definitly not weak, (limit of 3), and just as good as the chandler location. For food, we kinda went crazy with the apps. We ordered the chicken skewers,  mozz sticks, extra hot wings, and chips, salsa and guacamole. My friends ordered the BBQ burger, BLT and Greek salad. I tried to be healthy,(after the apps, what was the point?:), and ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, with jalapeños, and with a side salad. It was pretty good, I would definitly order this again with cheese! Friendly server also. Can't wait to go back:)"}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a beer and late night bite. Their ciabattas are really good and prices are pretty good. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Mill Ave Zipps....I normally go to the Old Town location, but a few weeks ago I went to this one.  The Golden Hot Wings are a must-have here and you can get a big ass mug of beer (as always, I get Alaskan).  Pretty much the same as the other Zipps....except they have this amazing tv set right at the bar.  You'll know what I'm talking about once you've been there.  I will say nothing more so you can have a reason to go if you aren't convinced already.

Parking is a pain at Mill, but it's not Zipps fault."}
{"text":"Service and food were both less than satisfactory. Greek salad was gross,  kids pizza was gross also.  Fish an chips were only ok. Definitely won't be back here again."}
{"text":"Well, we ended up at Zipps because my daughter said she wanted to try something new and wanted a salad.  So here we are.  We're tired of going to the same places over and over again so decided to venture outside our area.  Needless to say completely unimpressed and disappointed.  

Let me start by our walk in.  Nobody was at the hostess station to take down our information.   Once the hostess finally came up, she said it was going to be a 10 to 15 minute wait.  This was the only positive about our experience.  Our little buzzer rang and they seated us at a booth in the dining area.  Put the menus down and away she went.  The ambiance is very dark in here.  So each of the booths have little lights on the one side of the table.  That's great for those who are sitting right up on the light.  In our case, the light wasn't even working.  It kept dimming in and out and the menu itself is dark so it was very hard to read. 

Our waitress, couldn't even tell you her name.  Now being in the customer service industry I watch the level of service given everywhere I go.  And here in Arizona, the wait staff in a food and beverage industry make less than minimum wage so their personality need to come through if the expect to make any money.  They're called tips and listen up our little waitress, you need this tip.  Welcome your customer to Zipps.  Make conversation.  Ask them if they've ever been there before and if they're returning customers thank them for coming back.  If they're new, as we were, make recommendations.  Lord help me help you, you're in the wrong business.   In this case, our server had the personality of a wet mop.  The music and noise level was so loud in there that you had to be a lip reader in order to understand what she was saying.  Terrible/Horrible.  

Our meals were, grilled chicken caeser  salad, a club sandwich on sourdough with fries, and the chopped ranch salad substituting the grilled chicken with grilled chicken in wing sauce.  Oh and an appetizer of mozzarella sticks.  Now those were interesting.  So you're at a sports bar and you would think that potato skins would be on the menu.  Not here that's how we ended up with the mozzarella sticks.  So I was reading another Yelpers review and he hit it right on the head with these.  Wrap was way too thick.   When the server brought them to the table my husband said \"she brought us the wrong appetizer.  We ordered mozzarella sticks and she brought us egg rolls.\"  Then he took a bite and said, \"nope, it's the right appetizer just different.\"  Different is being nice. 

Grilled chicken caeser salad:  Came with two pieces of pita bread with some sort of aeoli that had so much garlic on it I could smell it coming from the other side of the table.   Don't ask me how it tasted I couldn't tell you.  I'm allergic to seafood and didn't know if there were anchovies in it or not.  

Club sandwich on sourdough with fries:  The sandwich itself was a joke.  I could have made a better club at home and the fries should not be called fries.  They were fry shaped but tasted like a chip.  And crunched like a chip.  And they were all overcooked and burnt.  Sad.

Chicken ranch chopped salad:  I was in the mood for wings and a salad.  Another disappointment.  I told the server I wanted buffalo chicken on the salad instead of grilled chicken.  She was very inquisitive on whether I wanted the fried chicken like what's on the buffalo chicken salad or if I wanted grilled chicken tossed in wing sauce?  I told her grilled and tossed.  What did I get?  Grilled chicken with a huge ladle of wing sauce poured on top.  Yeah, the lettuce was literally swimming in wing sauce.  

Here's what inquiry minds want to know. For those of us who are foodies and like to explore new places and things, why isn't the management staff reviewing these reviews to see what the heck is going on in their own backyard?  They might learn a thing or two about what people are saying and start opening their eyes to what is happening on the floor and in the kitchen.   I guess after re-reading this review the trick to getting through a meal here is in the alcohol.  You must have to drink your way through a meal because the taste is so bad.  Unfortunately I wasn't in a drinking mood tonight.

In closing, you will see that I did not check into this location.  There was a reason for that.  Because our experience was so bad, I didn't want any of my friends to know I was here.  I only hope that my review will help others make informed decisions on how they spend their money on a meal.  Their profiles says that they are family owned and operated since 1993, well they better reel in the family because it seems that they are rather checked out."}
{"text":"We had a great time watching the Cardinals game at the 65th St & Greenway Zipps tonight, even though the Cardinals lost (the atmosphere was great, NOT the game). The server Mary did an excellent job ensuring that our water glasses were filled and our beers were full. Being the nice husband that I am, I texted my wife to see if she wanted me to bring food home for her. She loves chicken fingers so before I left, I put in my order. When I got home, my wife asked me why I brought back onion rings with a side of fries. They were  super-busy, so I can understand how this happened; no big deal. I proceeded to call the restaurant and was transferred to the General Manager Matt. Matt explained that Zipps policy states that the food must be RETURNED to the restaurant in order to make any adjustments. Needless to say, I live 20 minutes from the restaurant and this wasn't going to happen for a $10 order. Matt was extremely rude and unhelpful and gave me the number to their corporate office. I've been a customer since they opened their first restaurant Goldies Sports Café but I won't be returning any time soon. Matt managed to lose a 15 year customer in less than 15 minutes. Too bad because I really enjoyed Zipps."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am a huge Zipp's fan (as a chain) overall. That being said, this location is not on par with other Zipp's locations in terms of food quality / taste. 

My husband and I come here often to hit up happy hour and the service in in the bar area is always great but the food is just missing that certain something. At first we thought we were finally just getting burnt out on Zipp's food - we spent the better half of our courtship eating and drinking at Zipp's Camelback and hit up the 16th St. location often while we lived in the north valley. But whenever we visit a location other than Ocotillo we are reminded of what the food should taste like - the wings taste are more succulent, the burgers are bigger and juicier and the fries are crispier. 

I am not sure what Ocotillo is doing wrong in the back of the house (old fryer oil? Incorrect wing sauce recipe? Too small of burger proportions?) but we will no longer visit this location and will drive a bit further to Gilbert / Warner to ensure we are tasting the Zipp's quality of food that we have grown to love over the past seven years."}
{"text":"I find this location (Mill) to be one of the better Zipps locations (please Zipps, do something to fix the Ocotillo location's food!). The place is huge and we have never had trouble getting a table or a seat at the bar. The service has always been at least good if not great. 

Yes, their food is bar food (that is what they are, a SPORTS BAR). Go somewhere else if you do not want good but not-so-good-for-you bar food.

Our favs on the food menu are the medium gold wings, monaco focaccia, and sweet jalapeño and barbecue bacon burgers. Onion rings and fries can be hit or miss, but they are SO good on their good days (we do half onion rings & half fries as a side with the burgers or focaccia)."}
{"text":"Always comsistently great. Great hamburgers and ficcashas.  Golden wings are great.  Make sure tobasj for lettuce on yoir burger otherwise it doesnt come standard.  Great amount of variety of sports in the tvs.  Just watched the arm wrstling world championships!"}
{"text":"The service was awful.  We waited 20 minutes for our first drink.  We were hesitant to order food because the service was in such disarray, but we were hungry and ordered.  They somehow lost my order, as well as the order of one of the other five people at the table.  The waitress said that at least mine would be freshly-prepared, so I should have been thankful.  The table of five next to us left after 15 minutes of not getting to place an order.

I ordered what I thought might be simple, a chicken focaccia sandwich.  When the food came out, I figured maybe it was a wrong order, as the food was wrapped in a low-grade tortilla.  Apparently, that is what they think a focaccia is there.  I got a split side of onion rings and sweet potato chips.  The chips were good, but the onion rings were the worst I have had in years."}
{"text":"Unbelievable they actually brought one of my friends a drink with the roach inside of it the manager comes over and says sorry I'll buy you guys a round of drinks"}
{"text":"So Zipps is just zippy and I like it.  It is casual dining; a good wings, beer and burger joint. No Michelin stars here just fun food. We were visiting and met up with some local friends at their suggestion.  Apparently the locals like this place.  There was a good crowd for a week day.  They have plenty of sitting options including an out door patio in addition traditional restaurant style seating and a bar.  The decor is kind of plain, but who cares. My partner had the wings and said the were great.  I had the chicken fingers which were also good.  We split a half and half basket of fries and onion rings.  This is where Zipps excels.  First they have this half and half options for those of us who love fried potatoes but want the occasional onion ring.  Both sides were great. Crispy not greasy.  I had a happy hour flavored vodka and after we decifered that grape was not grapefruit we were in business.  Cant be at the price at 4 bucks!  A special shout out to our excellent server Jansen who was cute, personable and all smiles.  Zipps scores high for a nice crowd, server and food.  If your look for a drink and typical bar for severed with a smile.  Stop on soon,  Jansen or one of her colleagues will be happy to serve you."}
{"text":"Bartender was great.... But our order was messed up. We had to wait for it to be redone which would have been fine.... But we did not receive anything for our troubles. We had to leave and we then had to wait for our order that now had to be a \"Togo\" bc of the time crunch. I just don't understand how this should be put on the guest and make us suffer. Should have compted something off at the very least."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night with some family. Came in waited to be seated took about 5 min. Decided to just seat ourselves. The place was pretty empty. The waitress finally came by, and had a really bad attitude. So, we ordered some beers (I was visiting from California and had a California ID)  she asked me for a credit card or some other proof that that was me like seriously !? So we ordered right away. Got a big pizza, some wings and a sandwich with a salad. I saw my food sitting on the line for about 15 min and asked the waitress if it was our wings. She said no and immediately went to the kitchen to remove them from the line. The pizza tasted like elementary school card board pizza, the wings were OK and I didn't taste the sandwich. The ranch is really good though. The waitress didn't even come back once to ask us how everything tasted until we were all done with our food. She came to the table about 3 times through out our stay. I'm also a server in a restaurant and I understand how stressful, and busy things can get. However this girl was just a bad server, and I just had a bad experience overall. I will definitely NOT be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I'd have to agree with the accuracy of the poor reviews for this place. It used to have good service and decent bar food, but the place just seems to be bringing itself down with really really poor customer service and problem resolution. My last visit I had to walk out. Was seated but no one came to take our drinks after about 15 minutes, mind you the place was completely dead, there were only about 5 tables being used, and there were at least 4 waiters walking around. None of them bothered to come to our side of the restaurant so that we could at least flag one of them down, but going to a restaurant shouldn't require you to have to do so for a simple glass of water. I'm not sure if it was done purposely, but we were the only people that were sat far away from everyone else, but the waiters could clearly see us and would just not come to our table. Whether they're racist or homophobic I would've much rather had them tell me they were going to refuse service, which is their right if they wanted to, than to ignore us and put us in the back the way they did."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!!  one star is too much for this place filthy the food was cold the waitress never returns for refills or anything els very poor service our order when they finally got around to take it was messed up and cold 2 hrs waisted Garbage!!!?  do your self a favor go somewhere els"}
{"text":"I come here a lot and wonder why every time. I love the atmosphere and the food is great, but for being a regular, I'm sick of being penalized for weighing a mere 113 lbs and not being able to consume my own meal. If I wanted extra food, I would order extra food. No! I share at every restaurant I go to merely because I am incapable of consuming large amount of food. Here, if you share, they charge you extra and bring u extra! Wtf! I have money. I am not trying to be a cheap skate. I don't want it. So don't penalize me for it. On top of that, I order your expensive beer.  This place needs to stop overcharging because a person doesn't order as much good as they think they should!"}
{"text":"Meh...  that's how I felt about it.  It's a standard local bar and below-average food.  Our kids had pizza which was soggy (although their french fries were good) and we had a taco salad that was small and not-so-good.  Service was perfectly fine and the prices were average.  I wouldn't rush back here for a meal, but for drinks and some game-watching, it's fine."}
{"text":"I wish I had a better experience but It happens!? I'm not sure why I was given an attitude from this bartender? 

She asked for my card for a tab before my DL so I gave her my DL so she wouldn't get in trouble. I didn't want to start a tab since I was ordering food and 1 drink. Didn't make any since. Never have anyone asked this of me at a bar for ordering1 drink. I'll never come back. 

I over heard her talking loud about the situation to her co worker as if I wasn't sitting 2ft away!? Sad situation. No manager nor a supervisor showed up


Well she didn't appreciate my little note I left for her & management so she came back to confront me as I drank my beer. I received a Sad apology with an attitude. 

Needless to say I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Water tasted like mold, French fries were stale. BLT where are the tomatoes?!! Bartender friendly but not attentive"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to find out they were opening a Zipps in Tempe. There hasn't been a great place to watch sports on MIll Ave so I think this will be a popular spot. It is saturated with TVs which is a good thing I guess.

The food is solid and reasonably priced. They have a good selection of burgers for around $8 with fries (double patty). The fries are just okay but I'd recommend subbing the onion rings if you're in to that sort of thing. 

The real draw to this place is their happy hour deals. From 3-7 every weekday they do $3 zipparitas and domestic pints plus some other good deals. There are also specials from 8-close that vary depending on the day.

The first time I went the service was less than great but I've been back and they seem to have worked out the kinks. Zipps is a great place for all; I'd recommend it to pretty much anyone."}
{"text":"My husband and I had high hopes for Zipps and had been there before for drinks. We went for dinner this evening and had a bad experience. The place was not over-packed, steady flow busy. We ordered an appetizer and it took, no exaggeration, 50 minutes to arrive and the food we ordered never did arrive. We aren't ones to complain, but spoke with a manager in regards to the slow food arrival. He was unapologetic and didn't seem to care. We ended up leaving and got Culver's instead. Disappointed, going to try a different location because we've heard the food is good, but do not recommend this location."}
{"text":"I want a jim and coke in pint glass....no we dont serve like that.....well wont come back ever. ..such not  a big deal...."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar to come in watch any sporting event plenty of tv's. They have the best wings in town. Their burgers and sandwiches are pretty good but not a fan of their pizza."}
{"text":"Wings are ok but overall I hate Zipps. Like a lot. All of food other than the wings suck. My friends nachos were just a giant clump of chips, cheese, and melted together to point that we needed a fork and knife to break apart the clump. I also I feel the beer should be cheaper."}
{"text":"In 23 yrs. In az. this was the worst meal my wife and two other friends and I have ever had.The potato chips were like chewing jerky and the manager traded them for French fries which were even worse like limp greasy noodles. We drove 55 mi. To eat here and the disappointment was terrible. Never again and would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!! We were looking forward to coming here with all the hype we heard about the food. What a freaking bust!!! Came here to watch the Bulls kick Heats ass. We were planning to watch the whole game but left early because the food just sucked! Had the nachos...blah! Cheese wasn't even melted and nachos not warm. Chicken fingers with fries & onion rings were just as bad! Fries & onion rings were stale, flavorless & had no crunch whatsoever. I didn't have the chicken but hubby said it was nothing to rave about. The only good thing about this place is the really cold beer. Fail!"}
{"text":"Our waitress greeted us right away and got our drink order. When she came back, we told her we needed just a minute or two to figure out what we wanted to order. She didn't come back for another 10 minutes or so. We were one of five tables at lunch time. We ordered an appetizer -- $8 for five mozzarella sticks? WTF!! I could make better mozzarella sticks at home for cheaper. Our burgers were decent, and the fries and sweet potato chips were good. However, the waitress never came back to check on us. When we paid in cash, she asked if we wanted our change back. I told her yes, we did. She came back without the change and said \"did you still want your change?\" I told her yes, nothing had changed in the two minutes she was gone. She came back with the change, and we signed the receipts, left the tip, etc. We were still visiting when she came and picked up her tip (rather rude to do so before the customers leave in my opinion), and proceeded to stare at us from behind the counter near the kitchen until we left. We used to frequent Zipps all the time to watch games or for a late night meal after leaving a game. We will not be back because of the prices and terrible service. The only reason this review isn't getting one star (or zero if that was an option) is because the food was edible. Zipps needs to rethink their menu and customer service since other reviews mention the same flaws."}
{"text":"If zips served pancake then it could call itself molassas and that would be more fitting.  Someone that we came with died. The ambulence came.  The coroner pronounced them dead before they delivered my daughter's food was delivered.  We came on Sunday March 15th and it was st Patricks  day before we left. In addition to the burned burger, I burned two vacation days waiting for food here. If you find yourself going here,  Zip to somewhere else, anywhere else as fast as you can. You will never get this time they take from you back."}
{"text":"I have no words for how this company is run. The servers are so stressed out and tired, so I know that's the reason for the bad service.  All zipps are horrible  and everyone I know feels the same. And an FYI, you need to know the servers do the dishes, so if they are gone for a long time it's only because they are trying to get off work  by 3 am so they are doing all the crazy sidework they have. They have sweet tvs though."}
{"text":"Not Sure why Zipps has such bad reviews?  We came here after watching the Ironman today, and I thought it was great.  Happy hour on Sundays are $7 burgers and $10 pitchers.  Throw in a $4.50 Bloody Mary, and you have a Sunday Funday on your hands.  I had the Burger with Green Chili's and it was delicious.  PepperJack cheese, green chilis, and a side of Chili to go with it?  Yes Please.

Prices were reasonable, and the food was good.  It's worth giving it a try, if there is a happy hour going on!"}
{"text":"22 screens and 10-11 screens with the patriots/bills game and they can't put on a tv screen with the Final day of the Ryder Cup.  This unpatriotic act is unacceptable.  1 star"}
{"text":"This is a chain business that is greedy and selfish and is not supportive of this community. Being a team player is much more conducive to neighborhood support and good customers. I will never return to this establishment due to their offensive business decisions toward the farmers market and those who support it."}
{"text":"For a sports bar, Zipps was about on par with the expectation.  I went there for the NBA finals and couldnt have had more fun with the guys and girls who came out even though I was in the minority rooting for the Cavs.  Food was good, didn't try anything else but the happy hour wings and beer which were pretty good.  Also another recommendation is to try the sweet wings, just ask your server, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing wings. Jalapeno burger was recommended by bartender, for good reason. It was quite tasty. Fun environment, great place to watch a game or just socialize."}
{"text":"Hey hey hey now... i don't agree with all of these negative and poor reviews. My boyfriend and i LOVE coming here! This is always our \"go to\" spot for food. Granted the prices are a little high, buuuuut, their chicken wings are WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY! Especially the golden medium wings, simply amazing. Also, their thousand island burger is just to die for. I think the only bad thing i would have to say about this place is that we always seem to have an issue with our waitresses.. they just take way too long. We usually go when it's not crowded at all, they just take a while to serve a request in a timely manner, but other than that, we love this place. If you are a sucker for wings, come HERE! Definitely will continue coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Zipps is great for watching sports, but definitely get there early for whatever game you want to watch. There's plenty of seating, but it fills up fast. Each TV is designated with what team it'll be playing, so you can plan accordingly.

Service is fine, and the food is pretty average. Of course, you're going to watch a game and get a few drinks, not for the meal of your life, so don't expect too much. Drinks are reasonably priced, and if you're hungry, try the nachos or chips and salsa. There's also plenty of parking, which is good.

I'd go back to watch a game."}
{"text":"When we arrived we were told it was open seating and to sit wherever we wanted.  We preferred the patio but the only two open tables were dirty.  We asked if one could be cleaned, which was done haphazardly.  The young woman gave us our menus and asked if we wanted drinks.  All 4 of us ordered a drink.  About 15 minutes went by when she showed up with 2 drinks.  After waiting another 5 minutes or so we asked about the other drinks and she brought them out.  We noticed that people who had arrived after us had already gotten their food and since we had somewhere to be, one of us asked the server how much longer our food would be and she quickly replied that it was on its way out, only about 5 more minutes.  At this point we had been at the restaurant about an hour.  A short while later a \"manager\" of sorts came to the table and said there had been a glitch in the kitchen and our food was running late and asked if we would like to cancel our order.  We said no, we didn't have time to go to a different restaurant.  She brought out 2 more drinks \"on the house\" (as though that would be sufficient for this lousy experience).   Another 15 minutes went by before the first meal came out, 10 more minutes the second,  followed another 10 with the remaining two meals.  When confronted about why this happened, the person who gave us our tickets said the young woman was training, had gotten distracted and forgot to give our order to the kitchen.  We were lied to up until that point.  The manager of this restaurant is clearly in the wrong business as this was deceitful at best.  Had we been told by the young woman when we initially asked that she forgot our order, we would have opted out but we believed our order was \"in the making\".  None of us will go there again."}
{"text":"I kind of wavered on whether I should write a review about Zipps - my reasoning was based on #1 it's a sports bar and #2,well, it's a sports bar. But I did review The Library..... and after thinking about it, I seem to have a lot to say.
I've been here several times, and this latest bout was a 3 to 4 star experience. So, I'm giving it a 4 star based on other sports bars in Gilbert.
Zipps doesn't have anything to write home about. It's a sports bar with a LOT of TVs, 2 pool tables, a shuffleboard table, a few video games, and one of those stuffed animal machines. 
There is a patio for the smokers, a dining area for the family or large group that want to come here and eat a meal, and a bar area for the drinkers and smaller social groups, and die hard fans that want to be up close and personal with their team of choice. 
There was only one game on (STEELERS vs. Chargers) so we didn't have to worry about positioning ourselves correctly. However, there have been times when we didn't show up for gameday in a prompt manner and were forced to crank our necks to catch our game (even though they do have a zillion tvs). It gets pretty busy in here and once the crowd starts shuffling in, it seems as though the wait staff starts to forget things, the bartenders get sloppy, and the kitchen backs up. This place has been opened long enough to understand proper expediting and timing. Right?
The food is, well - ok. It's bar food, after all; I had to keep reminding myself I didn't come here for a crudo of sea scallops with vanilla salt or a braised duck breast. 
They do have a generous selection and there were a *few* specials. $1 off a large pizza or $8 specialty burgers. I did appreciate the selection of burgers which can be ordered in either beef, chicken, turkey or garden. They have flatbreads (which I didn't really like), a few specialty salads, and some sandwiches. 
On this visit, we ordered the Chicken Fresca sandwich which was basically a chicken breast with pepperjack cheese, some sort of Jalapeno sauce, salsa, and a bun. It was good, but the bun was soggy and the lettuce was wilted and lifeless. I would order it again, and just eat the chicken because it was perfectly grilled and the salsa was a nice compliment to go with the pepper jack. 
They have a good selection of beer. However, I opted for a citron lemonade (*I must keep reminding myself I'm\"m at a sports bar) and I literally got vodka and lemonade (and it was the kind of lemonade out of a bar spigot - not true bar lemonade). I suppose I was expecting a teakwoods tommy lemonade (mmmmm those are the best) 
Our server was gracious enough to realize that we were probably going to sit at that pub table for quite some time, and didn't try to move us out. She kept our party somewhat happy and she was prompt with our tab. 
So it is what it is. It's Zipps. It's fun. I'll probably go back (It seems like I always do). But there are a LOT of sports bars out in GIlbert to choose from."}
{"text":"What I wouldn't give for a real corner bar like they have back east. Zipps continuously proves that they are nothing more than a corporate douche bar. From split plate fees to premium charges on local beers (even if they are domestic) to slow service because they cut back on staff, I think the only reason I go here is because they are nearby and open past 10 PM. Why do I do this to myself? I have tried on multiple occasions to speak to management but I keep getting shot down with BS excuses. One lady in marketing literally tried to blame Arizona tax pairs on their poor service. I should screenshot the email and post it on yelp. Anyway, hopefully they will change their ways and be the authentic cool local pub that we really crave and desire in South Tempe."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero stars I would. We went there to watch the ASU football game yesterday with a couple friends. We ordered wings, a basket if fries any some cocktails. Let me start off with the food. The wings and the fries were dry, greasy, and cold. We waited forever to get our cocktails. The waitress never checked on us while we were waiting. She was unfriendly almost rude. I will not go back there again."}
{"text":"Tabletop version of shuffleboard (well it's close) is the main reason we come here for drinks and decent pub fare.  Service is usually decent, fried food and burgers are above average, and prices aren't terribly bad for Scottsdale.  Recommend: onion rings."}
{"text":"Don't know what it is when we come eat here...  It takes a LONG time to get our food after we order it...  We've been sitting here for 30 minutes so far!!!  We LOVE the food but just can't understand what takes so long!!!"}
{"text":"I have come to the Zipps and Chandler on multiple occasions and I really have nothing bad to say about it. Plenty of TVs with high definition hookups so you can watch all your sports on an array of flat screens. As far as food and drink I get the wings and their margaritas known as zipparitas. They are cheap as hell during happy hour and they pack a punch while the wings are delicious! I believe they're building one in Ahwatukee but I don't know if it's opened yet as of March 2014."}
{"text":"Love the wings here. Prices are great at happy hour. Servers are always friendly. Will for sure come here again!"}
{"text":"The food was horrible. I have had better food from a gas station! The bowl of chili was COLD! My brothers cheese burger was room temp, rock hard and the bun was so old it was dried out crispy. The beers were also room temp! They obviously take no pride in there work, if you are looking for a good meal, this is not the place. Took 30 minutes at least to get our cold food!"}
{"text":"Came here to meet a friend and have always had great experiences at Zipps.. Except this time. It wasn't horrendous but borderline. I got to zipps a bit early and the waitress seemed to be to busy to worry about me. To be completely honest there I am pretty sure the waitresses outnumbered the guests since it was like 515 on a Tuesday afternoon. I finally waved down a waitress and got my beer order in. after my friend got there waved the waitress down again to get her a beer. The worst part of this I had to keep waving them down while they were just chatting with co workers. We had a couple beers and as we tried to get the check, my friend got tired of waving at the waitress who we both could have sworn was looking right at us as we were waving, and went up to the servers booth and asked her for the check. It was pretty redonkulous, im hoping it was just a \"off day\" for them since this is one of the places I like to visit while on mill ave."}
{"text":"Watched a Cards game here, after eating somewhere else. Food looked great (for bar food) from what I saw. I'll be back to eat soemtime."}
{"text":"Ok when I first moved here from Buffalo about 3 years ago this place was very popular with my coworkers after a long shift. I was impressed with their wings and prices and the amazing service. In the past year they have extremely went down hill. My wings have been over done and some cooked to the point where the meat is so dry and then covered in their golden sauce to hide their over cooked meat. I thought maybe it was a off night but I've been back a couple times and same thing. I began ordering chicken skewers and they have went from chicken fingers on a stick to chicken nuggets on a stick. I tried the zips by my house in Arcadia and same thing! The service had even become slower. My waitress checked on us once and we counted 5 times she's was chilling up by the bar shooting the shit with the other waitresses. The place wasn't even slammed and we waited 40 min for wings? I've never waited more then 20 min on a busy night. Looks like I will be taking my wing business elsewhere. I am not sure what changed but I hope they go back to whatever they were doing."}
{"text":"Wrote a review about this place and interesting, it is was removed....It wasn't offensive in language. ....I would not recommend this place to anyone.  Rude manager, horrible service, long wait for food and when we got the food the onion rings and fries were soggy.  The nacho chips were soggy as well...the server forgot part of the bar order.
This is was the second time visiting Zipps so I did give it another try but I know I will not be back and would not recommend this place.  One reviewer got it right...'if you sit at the bar and order a pitcher of beer and a burger you might be satisfied but don't bring a group of 5 or more'...you'll be stuck with horrible service and worse, the food.
Sorry, hope the review remains on Yelp."}
{"text":"We gave this place 2 chances and both times we had aweful customer service. The waitress was overwhelmed on both occasions, missing items that we ordered. The onion rings, fries, nacho chips were soggy, no crispy outside...the onion ring was so chewy that I couldn't eat it...the nacho chips were soaked in the dip toppings and also soggy.  The waiting time on both occassions was ridiculous...I'm not sure we will ever go back...don't order these items.....it looks like the other reviewers had a good experience but I will not be returning....best wishes...hope your servers will get some help, less tables, more service..."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend I hadn't seen in 10 years!! She picked Zipps. Loved it. Waitress was excellent, beers were refilled timely & hamburgers were great!

Wish there was one in Chico, Ca!!"}
{"text":"I guess I've never written a review for this location even though it is the one closest to my house. Zipps is a sports bar and their food reflects that but I do really love their honey balsamic salad. It is soooo yummy! I am sure the dressing has a ton of sugar and with all the dried cranberries and candied pecans it is basically like eating salad candy. But hey, it's got to be better for you then the burger and fries, right? They also have really good wings and the golden medium wings is another must order item for me. I wish they would get a better selection of craft beer on tap, though. They do have Blue Moon and usually one or two offerings from Four Peaks or San Tan."}
{"text":"Met a friend there for drinks, the food is okay and drink specials are the typical you see everywhere. Wasn't overly impressed but I can say if you wanted more than BWW to watch a game then you have another choice in Zips."}
{"text":"What ever you do DO NOT GET THE TACOS  CGICKEN OR BEEF they are so flavorless, go across to taco bell instead those at least have better flavor. No kidding though do yourself a favor skip out on these tacos .

The zipparita are delicious 
The pepper jack foccacia and the burgers are amazing, but do not order the damn tacos.
Wings are incredible. Mild golden style 2 ranches you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Go early and bring ear plugs. A bt noisy. Very friendly staff but there was only 2 of us and they didn't seat us right away because the tables open were for 6 or more."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night to split some wings and a cheeseburger with the lady.  Well, if you want to split a burger they charge you $1.50 for this.  Hmm.  Why were my wings not charged an additional $1.50?  I understand their thought process but we were not hungry enough to order 2 dishes and waste food.  Also, for a sports bar on a Friday night, I expect beers to be continually full, not waiting 10 minutes in between.  I'll be back for the wings and for a change but the customer service definitely will be remembered."}
{"text":"Zipp's used to easily get 4 stars but after this last visit the rating must be down graded. Why?! Because they raised the price of their once wonderful chicken wings on happy hour by $2 and reduced the count to ten.  More for less .  The wings still taste as good as they did before, which is nice but unfortunately without the allure of that happy hour wing special, I don't think I'll be coming back.   More people other than myself may agree with this as it was quite slow inside.  Service gets an ok rating, the hostess was gone when we arrived and that took some time to get seated but the waitress was nice. Time to find a new wing spot."}
{"text":"Met a friend here before an event.  He had wings, beer and enjoyed them a lit.  The hubby had a buffalo chicken salad and a rum/coke.  I had the chicken fingers w/ fries and onion rings.  Tasted good but the whole thing was very greasy.  I had a couple of rum/cokes too.  The dinner never really sat well and mid-way through the event I had some intestinal distress which lasted a couple days.  Not sure if I am just not used to greasy bar food, the alcohol compounded the issue the food was somehow bad.  I will never know because no one else was I'll and I never felt feverish or horrific.  Just not a nice dining experience which is a shame because the staff was very attentive and courteous, the service fast and always nice to watch MNF on multiple screens."}
{"text":"Worst meal I've ever had in Chandler. Went for a nice lunch with my daughter. My salad had lettuce floating.... nasty. Nothing fresh and horrible service. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Excellent for for pre-movie meals and cold beer with excellent prices... Also perfect atmosphere for any sports game viewing. We frequent this establishment often and the manager that looks like a viking (with a beard and baseball hat) is always friendly, polite, and makes everyone feel welcome. If I died and woke up on the floor of zipps with a cold beer and chicken skewers I'd consider myself to be in heaven."}
{"text":"Ok, maybe I am feeling some type of way because I am not an AZ local, and the people that come here are, hence the less than stellar reviews. I went here for the AZ playoff game against Carolina. This place was freakin PACKED. Luckly we got a seat at the bar. 

There are plenty of TV's to go around, matter of fact, there are enough TV's for all of Mill Ave. This is a great place to watch an NFL game (unless it is the Cards losing to the Panthers). Fortunately, I wasn't partial to who won the game, I just wanted to see a good football game. 

One thing that I would have to say is the food is damn good (great bar food) especially the wings, fries, and cheese sticks. As busy as it was, the bartender (I think her name was Amy - she is a Niners Fan) was SO ON POINT it was crazy. I don't care if you doubled the amount of people in this bar, she was working the entire bar like she owned the damn place - super impressive. 

As well, the restaurant portion was packed too. There were families there, singles, couples, everyone! This is definitely a diverse crowd! 

Sometimes, people lose sight on how hard people work at a place like this, it is busy and the servers are working their asses off trying to make sure everyone is taken care of. I will give you a few hints, say please, thank you, and tip well, the likelihood of you having an poor experience will go down exponentially. If you want to act like you are a two year old that can't find their bottle, you will get treated accordingly. 

When I come back to AZ, I will definitely hit up Zipps, it definitely grew on me, fun place, loud, and a good time."}
{"text":"I definitely get down with Zipps. On this particular day my boy and I went there to watch some college football on a Saturday afternoon. I have been to at least four different locations in the PHX Metro area and unfortunately I have had a much different experience at each Zipps. What makes it even more unfortunate is, this one caught the brunt of the bad side. I don't want to say it was a terrible experience, because that wasn't the case. However, when I compare it to all the other Zipps I have been to, this one is in last place. 
The service was solid, but the food is what is in question. I had some wings and fries and they just weren't cooked as crispy as they should have been. I don't know about you, but I don't get down with soggy, deep fried hot wings. They should be full of flavor and have a nice crunch/pop when you bite into them. This wasn't the case. 
One thing I could do, if I have the opportunity to go there again, I can do my due diligence and ask for them to cook them crispy or well done to see if there is a difference. Otherwise I would definitely have to order something different."}
{"text":"First night in Phoenix so we stopped in to Zipps. Ok, it is just a Sports Bar, but does it have to stink too.

We decided to sit out on the patio because the weather is so nice. I am not rating them for the view, (or lack thereof), we weren't there for the view. Nonetheless the small patio faces a major throrough-fare, so there ain't no ambiance [sic].

The patio had not been washed for A while and they didn't even wipe the tables. The bottoms of my shoes were sticky and I had to find a puddle to get the goop off my shies when we left.

I ordered a fish taco that was really a burrito. That is not the worst of it. The fish was overcooked in old oil. The buffalo shrimp appetizer was overcooked in the same old oil.

Table service was at least decent. It is the server that gained the two stars. This place is not a spot for Foodies. It is a bar that serves greasy, bar food. The food appears to be formulated to protect your stomach from a night of heavy drinking.

I prefer good food. Zipps is not the place for me."}
{"text":"First time here, Saturday evening around 6. We were seated immediately ordered an appetizer of chicken wings golden sauce they were very good my wife ordered three tacos two chicken one beef I ordered the hot dog with sauerkraut and onion rings on the side the hotdog was OK you can't really mess up a hotdog the onion rings were OKThe two chicken tacos my wife ordered fell apart as she pick them up we told our server they should try doubling up the tortillas on the tacos anyway they comped us the tacos for free which was very nice of them we might be back again to sample the menu.For now I will give them three out of five stars"}
{"text":"Golden wings, best ever!! Great happy hour.  Food is delicious.  Great place to watch sporting events."}
{"text":"!!!DONT EAT AT THIS LOCATION!!!
Leah the manager , was horrible with service, very rude, asked for carrits and ranch and never got it, my friends all got their food and my girlfriend and our son waited 30 mins after they got theirs, when i made the complain she looked at me as if I was lying, horrible CUSTOMER SERVICE.
My serverr brook was the best though definitely this girl deserves the promotion maybe take over the manager's position"}
{"text":"We always go to this location. IMO it's less crowded & usually we get a great server. We've had a bad one before, but since noticed she doesn't work there anymore. We were there on Memorial Day & we had the BEST service ever. I feel terrible for not remembering her name but she has short brown hair, & is a petite girl. Absolutely wonderful. Efficient, nice, quick thinking. We got wings & we are kinda particular about the crispyness & we told her that & the wings came out PERFECT. Take my advice & order double crispy. When we got our Togo box, she brought a lid for my extra ranch which i forgot to ask for, but she didnt! Little things like that are what point out an awesome server to me. It just shows how much attention she's paying. Only complaint, music was WAY too loud. One song came on & I could barely hear myself think. But other than that silly little thing, great time. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite and watch a game.

They have burgers, wings, sandwiches,  appetizers, pizza and more. Plus drinks from sodas to beer.

Sometimes it is as close as going to the game with the loud crowd that can get there.

When there is a big game you better get there early to get a seat. 

Fun place to eat and watch a game."}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool. The chicken fingers looked kind of weird but they were good. A great place to watch a wide variety of sports while drinking. Even with me not being a big sports person I enjoyed being here. The service was awesome. I definitely recommend this place to a big sports fan. :)"}
{"text":"As a regular, I am disappointed at this location. I feel there are a lot of hidden price increases here compared to what they personally advertise. Look at the menu long enough and check your receipt and you'll often see that the prices don't match or what they advertise ... Grrrrrr


... And apparently this location advertises the kitchen closes at midnight when clearly they close it much earlier ..."}
{"text":"Me and friends come here often to enjoy happy hour or sometimes the night time specials (past 8pm). The food is always pretty good, nothing amazing but its a consistent quality that is right in line with the sports bar setting that it's in. Fun atmosphere with plenty of sports on (duh) and the ability to play darts, pool, or shuffleboard is great.

The wings on special are a great deal, and the 'Golden style' is always a great choice. The 'Zipparitas' are surprisingly strong and delicious for a small little frozen margarita, but it makes it a good choice for a non-beer happy hour drink.

However, the service can be hit or miss. I've had great service as well as quite poor service here. I understand it's ability to have a packed house can affect the promptness of service, but often enough it doesn't correlate and boils down to just a bad server (or at least a server having a bad night)."}
{"text":"The good: Great burgers and fish/chips.  Lots of TVs.

The bad: I keep trying the wings, hoping they'll get better.  They're soggy, taste like vinegar, and aren't even hot.

The ugly: Terrible beer selection, but that might be the fault of their customers.  Don't even have Four Peaks?  Give me a break!"}
{"text":"We stopped in late on a Sunday night.  Poor service.  Had to ask for menus.  After we ordered and received our over cooked pepperoni pizza and overcooked wings, even had to ask for tableware!  Beer was good."}
{"text":"Called today for wings. Very rude server. Kept putting me on hold to answer other calls. Apparently they don't need my business."}
{"text":"The members of our family are loyal customers of Zipps Chandler.  The customer service is excellent and we really like the food.  For a special occasion on a hot summer day, there is nothing better than a Zipparita!   In particular, as regular customers, we have come to know Adam, the manager, very well.  He does an excellent job as a manager and is always welcoming and friendly.  He also maintains high standards for food quality.  His dedication and professionalism is appreciated. Adam inspires his servers to provide excellent customer service in Zipps Chandler!  We feel truly welcome and are happy to invite friends to meet us at Zipps Chandler as we know they will have a great experience!  We like many of the servers, but would like to recognize Shaya in particular.  She does such a great job!  She is friendly, efficient, and has an excellent memory for details.  It is so nice that both Adam and Shaya know the names of our family and friends"}
{"text":"Such a casual sports bar, yet a fun and exciting atmosphere. Zipps now offers my favorite beer which is the Ace Pear Cider, soooooo delicious! They have great happy hour prices as well as reverse happy hour. You can always swing by to watch a game on one of their many tvs or just stop in for a quick bite or drink. Great items on the menu which are fairly priced. The food is yummy, especially being that its a bar like atmosphere."}
{"text":"Site says dogs allowed, yet when we brought our dog, we were told they were not allowed. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Very seldom will I go back to a place that I just am not fond of.  However, I have a friend that convinced me to meet for a drink.  Plus she said I have to try the chicken skewers, chips and salsa and guacamole.  My service Saturday, was much better, knew what she was doing and personable, Brieanna, i am horrible with names, was on top of our orders even though she seemed to have a pretty big area to cover, she herself deserves a 5 star rating.   Chicken skewers are pieces of chicken, lightly breaded, with choice of dipping sauce on a stick.   I know this is silly but they were really good, not overly fried and they were hot (one complaint I had was food was served cold).  I would recommend those.  The chips salsa and guacamole,  I really liked the salsa, for some it might seem average, but for me it seemed fresh, home made maybe, had right blend of spices and mild heat, guacamole was also good/average to me, but I am not a guacamole expert, and plus it is hard to pop up advocado.  The chips are what fell flat, I think they were suppose to be heated, but didnt spend enough time in the warmer so they had a oily film, and derailed my chip experience .... because of my friend I will continue to try this store.  I do wish them the best as I think it could be a fun place."}
