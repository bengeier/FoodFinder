{"text":"If you like Mexican, this is a good lunch place.  Very affordable.  I think it's a better value than Moe's.   The staff is very friendly.  Sometimes they give you complimentary cookies when you eat in. One knock is the parking lot can be a nightmare.  If you go Monday-Friday between 11:45 AM and 1:15 PM, you are sometimes better off parking across the street at the medical office parking lot.  I love the two taco combo with the chips and free refill pop for under $6."}
{"text":"Wow. Can't believe this location is closed. I was not aware that it had and tried to stop by to grab some lunch to take back to the office. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Salsarita's - The World's Freshest Cantina  I am starting to develop a serious addiction to mexican style food. This location is right in the Ballantyne corporate park area which is perfect for me. It is a short drive or long walk whichever I prefer. The staff her is great and seem to enjoy their work.   I will second CF and say the 2 Taco Combo is my favorite menu item so far. The meats are chicken, steak, pork, ground beef and even shrimp for a little extra $$. The seasoning are very good and not overpowering. The salsa's are really fresh and tasty.  Salsarita's is now my main source to feed my addiction!"}
