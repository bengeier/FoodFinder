{"text":"Restaurant is not very clean and lady at front counter constantly has an attitude will never return, food is not all that great, does not help closed on Sunday's in addition food is greasy and made sloppy...."}
{"text":"Normally I'm satisfied with the meal I get from New World ..... today was not the case. I ordered breakfast, Home fries, Turkey bacon and French Toast.... Home Fries excellent, cooked to perfection, bacon was like rubber, french toast was hard as rock, I had everyone in my office touch it because I wasn't going to eat it. The answer I received when I called to complain \"well usually we're told it's too wet, I'll just have to give you french toast the next time you come back\" and hangs up.  How can you compensate me when you don't even know who I am? Next time...........I think not. So Very Done!!!!!!!!!!!"}
