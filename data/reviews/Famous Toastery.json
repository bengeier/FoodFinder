{"text":"I'm not sure why this location has such a low rating but this location is great. Yes you will wait and yes you'll pay more than your other local choices like Waffle House but it's certainly worth both expenses."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to famous toasters. The food is decent. I'd give the overall experience a C. Not an anytime favorite. When I got here the table they seated us at wasn't clean and needed to be wiped off. Asked for bread plates and the ones they brought out were dirty. And had to send my breakfast meat back twice. Also, the pancake syrup has a weird taste to it."}
{"text":"Can I just say... this place ROCKS! Put aside for a moment that the food is outstanding! What I love is the experience. Davidson has small town charm. This morning just in front of the restaurant was the Saturday morning Farmers Market. This town is so quaint. Love it!   Toast is absolutely charming. It is my new favorite breakfast spot (or is it brunch). I didn't get out of bed until almost noon so for the sake of this review let's say brunch. They serve eggs after 12PM. Whoot Whoot!   I had trouble deciding though because their menu is so fantastic and they have daily specials. I was eying up the peaches and cream crapes and the pumpkin spice pancakes but settled on the Egg white Saturday scramble with Gruyere cheese, spinach and turkey accompanied by an English muffin and home fries for $9.50. They bring corn bread and apple butter as a starter that is way good. All of their food is so fresh. Also, they serve Mimosa's and Bloody Mary's(just sayin...).   If you are looking for a fabulous little place that could soon become \"your place\" try them out. Then enjoy the great little town of Davidson. It doesn't disappoint. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"DO NOT Order the Combo!! We have been going to Toast for a while now and they have great breakfast food, which is why I am giving them 4 stars. Today we went there for breakfast and I ordered a combo. The Combo costs $9.99 and comes with order of any of their flapjacks, one egg made to order, and a choice of either bacon or sausage. Now while that may seem like a good deal it's not, because it only comes with 1 flapjack not 2. So if you want what comes with The Combo ORDER EACH ITEM AS A SIDE ITEM!! You will SAVE OVER A DOLLAR for the same exact meal especially if you don't want their flavored flapjacks!!"}
{"text":"My family was in search of a place to meet for breakfast and we decided to try the Famous Toastery. The location with a sunroom for dining featuring a view of the water was delightful. The coffee was great and food was pretty good but the cornbread was a bit cold and dry, which is why I couldn't give this restaurant more stars. The complimentary apple jam, however, was homemade and refreshing. They also offered a number of appealing specials as well as weekday food and drink specials."}
{"text":"The food and service was awesome! We were seated, they explained how every staff member will help us rather than a set server. They had our drinks and food on our table within minutes of ordering."}
{"text":"Wow, what's to say about this place but wow. The  price on bill is a touch high, but lets face it you get what you pay for and this is the spot to do it. I got the country Benedict yep (that'll do pig that will do lol). Wife got the peanut butter banana French toast and we shared...... yes we did. Too bad this is not near home but when when come back through its a new to go spot. After days of disappointment as far as food and Yelp lies this is the gem in my eye. Now saying this, everything was not 100% me as far as taste. However that's taste and we are never all going to meet eye to eye. But if you love food and a nice to look at location please stop in here because we will again. With an upcoming move to east coast from CA this is going to be on my drive to my hockey games I will have to get my fix of both lol."}
{"text":"Coffee wasn't great to my boyfriend and I. Every server is \"SUPPOSINGLY\" your server but waited fifteen minutes for our bill after we were done eating, even though it wasn't busy at all. The food was good so that's why I gave three stars"}
{"text":"I normally love coming to Toast, and consider it my go-to breakfast spot. However, my side of fruit order came today and included moldy fruit. They took the fruit away but didn't offer a replacement. I want to continue supporting the restaurant but wish the staff and management would have at least asked about our experience, or offer a place on their website to discreetly provide feedback."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  A delicious gourmet breakfast in a warm and friendly but sophisticated small-town atmosphere.  They have creative omelets, pancakes, crepes, french toast, and egg dishes, and everything is fresh.  Whenever we are in town, we are there on Saturday mornings.  I have not dined there other than for breakfast, but the breakfast cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"I would give the serivce a solid 5 stars, the food 4 stars and value 3 stars.   My wife and I visited Toast for the first time today for lunch. Having been huge fans of Las Ramblas, we were amazed by the transformation of the room. Nice job, Toast.   My wife ordered a breakfast sandwich with a side of hashbrowns (really homefries in my opinion) and I ordered the Left Coast BLT (hold the brie).   Service was quick, as was the kitchen. We were attended to by multiple servers throughout our experience there and all were very friendly.   Our food arrived and my wife's sandwich arrived exactly how she ordered it and she said it was very good. Mine, however, arrived not toasted, despite being assured it would be toasted when I ordered it. OK, no problem, a minor hiccup which was corrected very quickly by the efficient waitstaff.   I wished, however, that I had actually looked inside my sandwich before sending it back for the toasting. When it arrived back I bit in and realized it only had 2 slices of bacon on it. Now, I should mention, the menu price for this sandwich is $8.95. Seriously, 2 slices of bacon on a $9 sandwich billing itself as a BLT???  I quickly got the attention of one of our wonderful servers and asked, \"does this sandwich always come with only 2 slices of bacon?\" Yes, he answered, and immediately offered me more bacon. Within a minute or a so, a plate arrived with 3-4 more slices of bacon. Now that is superior service...very impressive!!   Still, with a 20% tip, this turned out to be a $30 lunch, for 2 sandwiches, 1 side of homefries (oops, hashbrowns), 1 mimosa and 1 sweet tea. That's pretty steep.   Had it not been for that level of service, this would have been a 1 star review all the way."}
{"text":"From Cincinnati... Expecting the French Toast like from VITOR's... Only got toasted bread with jam. So disappointing"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. I got the stuffed French toast it was delicious. We were seated promptly, drinks were filled quickly and servers were very friendly. They have little cups of coffee you can fix while you wait and will give you a nice cup of coffee to go upon request, I personally appreciate small things like that. It's a little pricey for breakfast food but nothing unexpected as the facility is nice and modern. You will pay about the same amount as you would for a dinner out around this area. Great change a pace! Loved it!"}
{"text":"We were told to go here for breakfast as I favor eggs benedict and we like to eat breakfast out on weekends.  We only went once and our breadfast was good but the area is very tight, not relaxing at all and enough of a drive that I don't see us going there often just for the breakfast."}
{"text":"Breakfast review Always have a decent meal and attentive service.  Could be a little cleaner. Gum on my chair. Tables not cleared in a timely fashion around ours. It was not busy so this should have been easy to accomplish.  Will not stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Nothing spectacular or different.  Bit over priced.  Can get better value same quality or better at ihops.  Hot new place waited quite a bit on a Sunday to get seated and served.  Not worth the aggravation and prices in my opinion."}
{"text":"We had to wait fifteen minutes to be seated when at least five tables clearly ready when we got there.  There were three groups in front of us and over ten people behind us waiting outside, and the staff did not seem to be in a hurry.  The table they finally sat us at was ready the entire time we were waiting.   We had ask for the bread that is supposed to be provided at the beginning of the meal, and we had to follow up because our meal was not taken down correctly.  The pancakes were OK.  My boyfriend got the Eggs Benny, and while the overall concept made sense, the execution was a bit lacking. The eggs were cooked great, but the entire dish lacked salt.  The avocados would have been better if they were served in slices since they were really messy.  This place has potential, but overall the service is extremely lacking for the price."}
{"text":"Probably the worst dining experience we've had in years. We never tip low but couldn't provide a good tip on this experience. We waited in line for over an hour, it was an estimated 45 min wait. We were promptly greeted and our order taken. Manager brought out orders, mine was completely screwed up so he went back to get it corrected. In the meantime my boyfriend couldn't eat his because we didn't have any silverware. 10 minutes later no staff had even walked by so I hunted down some silverware. 10 more minutes later my French toast came out but no one brought syrup with the meal. I had to walk around and look for some. We finished eating and had to wait about 20 more minutes for the check. Multiple servers including our regular had walked by multiple times and never checked on us. The server was attentive to the table next to us so I asked if we could get our check while they were being tended to. No refills were provided and we weren't checked on. Food was okay but not worth spending 2.5 hours at the restaurant where I had to hunt down everything needed. The whole time the table next to us was heckling us on why we looked mad/irritated and using profane language mimicking me. Next time we'll go elsewhere.   Also plates had stains and food residue on them. You can tell they aren't properly washed."}
{"text":"I would really like to give five stars here but the fact of the matter is there menu pricing is just terrible. If I were to order a blueberry flapjack combo that includes bacon and one egg it is $9.99. However, if I order all three of these separately it would be only $8.77. I know this is a minor detail, but they need to fix this especially after the manager told me: \"we are aware of this. You may order anyway you like (for the pricing).\" Great food, great service but wacky pricing leads to a loss of a star here."}
{"text":"Over priced. Breakfast for 2 almost $30...not to.mention pancakes were overcooked. Def small portions for the $. We were the only people in the restaurant for a while, thought it was closed. Manager should have came around to ask about our dining experience, would have told him.   Wait staff very nice. I don't see this staying open too long if this continues. We are not going back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and the service was impeccable. The special Benedict was crab. The eggs were cooked to perfection and the home fries were real chunks of potatoes with great seasoning and I added extra onion. We ordered the fresh squeezed orange juice and it was the best I ever tasted. No citrus acid."}
{"text":"We come here for business meetings pretty much weekly. The food is always great and the service is next to none. Coming in for work meetings you typically have some sort of electronic device that eventually will need a charge. We inquired about outlets and Bryan came to our rescue. He grabbed us an extension cord within 2 min of our asking. I highly recommend coming here and enjoying the atmosphere, food, and phenomenal service!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Have been to the one in Mooresville, Davidson and Concord. Staff is always friendly and food is always on point!! Tuna melt and Mac and cheese is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting Davidson College and stopped in for lunch.  Great chicken Caesar wrap and juicy hamburger. Busy at lunch time, but still fast service and a great lunch. Love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was good and they had the best freshly squeezed oj I've ever had! Service could have been a little better. Over all it was a good place."}
{"text":"Where do l begin? Food was very good, service very atrocious. Trying to get a coffee refill was equivalent to geting Trump to name Hillary his secretary of state. With that said bring your own thermos of Java and at least it will keep you awake Waiting for Godot!"}
{"text":"This is an adorable restaurant! The atmosphere is so charming and the staff are really friendly.   I went for breakfast and everything was so good that I can't wait to come back for lunch. For breakfast I ordered the avocado omelet, which comes with three eggs, avocado, bacon, tomato and Parmesan.  It was very tasty. My only complaint is that the ingredients weren't integrated into the egg. The omelet was really a fried egg wrapped around the filling. I never like for restaurants to prepare an omelet this way. I prefer for everything to be mixed together. But most importantly, it tasted good.   The omelet comes with a side of either hashbrowns, grits or fruit and your choice of toast. I opted for the hashbrowns and wheat toast.  The hashbrowns are actually homefries (fried potatoes), and they were excellent. They cook them in bacon grease, which gives them tons of flavor!   The toast was also surprisingly good. In most places, the toast is an after that, but that's not the case here. The bread was thick and soft. Yum! I see why it's the namesake.   Tip: consider the decaf coffee or the half and half coffee. The regular coffee is quite strong.   Overall, this was a delightful experience. Thanks Toast for helping me start my day off right."}
{"text":"Wonderful local establishment!  I have enjoyed many a meal here and have never had poor service or food... and quite often have an extraordinary one.  The menu is simple with a variety of daily specials.  Your first trip you should indulge in their stuffed French toast.  Go early or on a weekday as the weekend wait can be lengthy.  Take a few people, have a mimosa, and have a convivial time."}
{"text":"Wow, just finished breakfast. Had a southwest omelet. Probably one of the worst I've ever had. I wonder if anyone cooking, serving or selling them at Toast has ever actually tried it. Way too many peppers, hardly any chorizo, bland eggs. Had a side of fruit, was ok but some of it wasn't ripe. My husband had bacon which was good and a side of fruit. Total with tip $30. Not the waitresses fault that the food was horrible. I will say it was served very quickly. 3 minutes after ordering it was on the table. Won't return. Upscale prices that don't match the food quality."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast, bar none.  We frequent this location, and won't go anywhere else.  The service is top notch, and the place is very clean and inviting.  I have sampled several different items, and have never been disappointed.  I know some reviews have mentioned the price is a little high, but I'm a true believer in \"you get what you pay for\".  I don't mind forking over a little more when you can tell everything is made to order, and always fresh.  I, for one, feel the price is spot on."}
{"text":"Always great place for breakfast or brunch. I would like to see the food cooked more on the hotter side, especially the hash browns."}
{"text":"Visited Famous Toastery for the first time (Concord NC location) yesterday.  Food was good and the wait wasn't bad for a Sunday.  The only issue I had was that one of the waiters gave our food to another table.  When those folks realized it wasn't theirs, he picked it all back up & brought it to us - this is a huge no-no in the restaurant business!  If I had been the health inspector, they would have gotten dinged pretty bad on that one.  The rules say if you give food to the wrong table and physically sit it down; then realize it belongs to someone else, you are supposed to take it back to the kitchen & start over. The reason is that the folks who initially received it could have coughed/sneezed/touched it etc., so this was not a good thing for him to do.  Maybe they just need some more training...."}
{"text":"my boyfriend and I went on a road trip around america and this was one of the places that was suggested to us by charolette regulars. we stopped in on a sunday after church. to our surprise, we didn't have to wait too long to be sat. after sitting at our table outside, we waited more than ten minutes and no server arrived. I had to go inside to get a host to get a server. after someone FINALLY greeted us, we ordered bloody marys. the server checked our ID's and another five minutes went by and the manager had to check our ID's agIn because we were out of state. after ordering, I found out the two things I wanted to order they didn't have. finally when our food was dropped off, it was wrong. we had another server help us. after dropping off the bill no one was around to take it. basically, we didn't get to talk to a manager and we're forced to leave close to exact change because we couldn't wait any longer. I would never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My mom and I go here for breakfast a lot (she LOVES it), and I always have a pleasant experience. The service is attentive and the atmosphere is usually clean and comfortable. (I don't recommend sitting outside during the warmer months because the mosquitoes and flies are an inevitable problem).  The food is generally good and reasonably priced. I recommend their omelettes, pancakes, and quiches. Personally I'm not a big fan of their home fries, so I get sliced tomatoes instead. It's nothing extraordinary, but it's consistently good."}
{"text":"My Wife and I attended yesterday as we had been told by friends about this new restaurant. I have to say that they did a beautiful job remodeling the place. It is a beautiful layout with great views of the pond inside the Boardwalk. We were greeted quickly and had our choice of where we wanted to sit. I had the French Toast Combo that came with an Egg cooked any way and a Breakfast meat of your choice. I chose Bacon of course. The Bacon was very flavorful and crispy, my egg was cooked a perfect over medium and the French Toast was incredible. My Wife had the Eggs Benedict and again, absolutely delicious. The Eggs were poached perfectly and the Hollandaise sauce was on point. She also had Potatoes with hers and they were so good that I about ate half of them and will definitely order those next time. The staff was very friendly from the time we walked in to the time we walked out. Drinks were always refilled and we even left with to go drinks. There was a altercation of some sort in the Kitchen that was loud and then we saw someone leaving out the front door with the Manager pointing at the door for him to leave. The Manager instantly apologized to the whole restaurant, then came to our table and introduced himself (I believe Tim was his name) and explained an employee was terminated and apologized for the noise and the interruption that caused in our dining experience and applied a discount for us. It didn't bother us but we were impressed none the less. We will be going back without a doubt. My only suggestion is to get a bigger sign so you can see the restaurant from the parking lot, it can be hard to spot."}
{"text":"Ate brunch for the first time at Famous Toastery. At the time we entered there were only 4 other people in the place. Finding a table was not an issue.  The servers were attentive. When I said I had not been before the important items for the server were to point out that 1. Every server is our server and 2. Everything was made fresh in house.  As for the food, I ordered the Combo (flapjack with an egg and bacon). The only thing the server asked was how I wanted my egg. I wish he had asked if I wanted powdered sugar on my flapjack. Personally, I'm not a fan, but that didn't impact my review.  My problem was that for the food to be fresh in house, it all came to the table barely warm. I expect it to be hot. Especially with only four people in the restaurant. Being too busy was definitely not the issue. The flapjack was undercooked. The bacon was limp. The egg was actually cooked properly, however it too was cold.  For the price and hype, my expectation was high but unfortunately it was let down."}
{"text":"Toast is a cute brunch place with so much potential. I would loved to have had the opportunity to rate the food; however, the service was so bad that we didn't even make it to our seats. Walking to the restaurant, we were a little discouraged to see so many people outside waiting for tables but were pleasantly surprised to hear it would be just a few minutes for a table for two - first available (inside or outside). However, after 30 minutes of watching party after party be seated before us after arriving after us, we inquired why people were being seated ahead of us. After being told they were parties of 2 and were open to first available seating, I explained that we were as well. Granted, we were hungry. But it wasn't the wait that bothered me the most. It is Sunday brunch after all. What bothered me most was the complete and utter lack of awareness; there was absolutely no attention to detail, no system in place to seat people! At a restaurant! There were 4 open tables plus a two seats at the bar, not to mention who knows how many seats in the back patio. And two of them were acting as hostesses. Too bad neither of them could figure out how to get butts in chairs. And I was so looking forward to the gluten free pancakes. I would rate zero stars but there wasn't an option for that."}
{"text":"The coffee is wonderful and so is the food.  My eggs weren't overcooked and the grits were creamy.  The service could have been better . . . I had to ask for coffee refills. Overall,I would go back again."}
{"text":"We've visited the Toastery about five times now, and it's a huge favorite with my family!    The restaurant is open only for breakfast and lunch (they close at 3:00 pm), and you always have the choice of breakfast foods or lunch items.  My family has enjoyed specialty flapjacks, grilled cheese sandwiches, Eggs Benedict, and meatloaf.  The stuffed French toast (hard to choose between strawberry and banana) is wonderful.  The menu is mainly plain, simple foods, but you'll also find some fresh new twists; for example one of the \"Benedicts\" they serve is called a Country Benedict -- it's biscuits smothered in sausage gravy, topped with two poached eggs.  (So many things are topped with two poached eggs; I suspect they have a cook in the back who does nothing but poach eggs, and that person is an artist.)  They use only the freshest ingredients and everything is made fresh on the premises -- and that freshness makes a difference in the quality of the food; for example, it really shows in the pico de guio used in the Huveros Rancheros (highly recommended), and the cornbread bites (with apple butter) that they bring to the table when you first sit down is clearly fresh baked.    Do consider ordering one of the specials.  These change, so you may not get another chance for those shrimp and grits later, whereas you can count on flapjacks and eggs remaining on the menu permanently.    They have a bar in the restaurant, but I've never seen anyone sitting at /ordering from it.  I think it'd be a little odd to order up an alcoholic drink to eat with a plate of eggs; also, it seems a little odd to order alcohol at a restaurant that closes mid-afternoon.    The restaurant is a expensive for what they serve -- expect a bill of $25-30 for two adults who order two entrees and two drinks -- but the quality is worth it.  It's definitely the best breakfast in town, even beating Cracker Barrel.    Finally, a warning:  If you go in 8:00-10:00 on a weekend, expect to wait.  This place is quickly gaining a reputation, and it fills up quickly.  Also, the parking lot is small and not the easiest to navigate.  We've started parking in the adjacent Lowes Home Improvement and walking over."}
{"text":"Soo not impressed, not worth the money.   I took some friends for sunday brunch. Had a great!! Server... service was on par...but the food.... the food.... i had the avocado omelet I had a side of hash browns, a waffle and a side of bacon.  1. The omlete did not inspire me to even take a picture.  It wasn't well presented, and the taste was just okay,not even great tasting. Nothing I could not have made myself.  Barely any avocado in it.  2. The hash browns were horrible. Too salty and not even hash browns more like smoshed country potatoes  3. Waffle was good, but that's almost impossible to mess up. 4. The bacon was soggy, and not crisp like I requested,  and wayyyyy too greasy. They didn't even blot off the excess fat.  One my friends there said the french toast was way too sweet, one friend ended up with peppermint toast, she did not order it, she ordered the regular one,said it was fine.   I had their coffee and a bloody mary... coffee was good, bloody mary was the worst!  Thank god it was not a 10$ bloody mary I would have been pissed.   The cost of the meal overall was too expensive for the quality of food they served."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! Be sure to ask to sit in the back, outside. The food is great and the lattes are even better."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a great breakfast place in Charlotte for years. I found a lot of good ones but not so many great ones. This place comes really close."}
{"text":"Food was good very busy location . Service was good since everyone helps out . Had the \"Avocado  Benny \" don't know if I would go back but that's just because I didn't feel it was anything that you couldn't have found elsewhere. But it was good overall"}
{"text":"First time eating here. Great place sort of out of the way and hard to find due to the construction but worth it. Sat in the enclosed patio on the pond. Wonderful service and food."}
{"text":"Great little spot with a very diverse menu offering gluten free and vegan options! While I can eat gluten and love meat/dairy, it's nice to know there are plenty of options for those that can't.  I enjoyed the combo (bacon, egg whites and French toast) which was pretty good. Coming from a city like San Francisco, it's certainly not the best French toast I've ever had but also not the worst. I'll certainly come back and give something else a try.  And last but not least - service is a-ok here!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place while looking for some breakfast. Oh wow, was it good! I had eggs benedict, and the eggs were hard-boiled like I like them, because I asked for them that way. And the grits were perfect! Bill had the pumpkin pancakes, which he said were very good, too. He also had the fresh squeezed orange juice, which he said was good, too. He is from Miami, so he knows his fresh orange juice. We will definitely be looking for this place again in the future."}
{"text":"Dear God. Listen, I've been here before - it's okay for what it is - I don't expect a gourmet meal. I just saw a review that said \"Absolutely Amazing.\" I'm not sure where this eats, but \"amazing\" is not a word I would ever use to describe the Toastery - it's mediocre food at best. In fact, I think my last time here was perhaps the most underwhelming and disappointing dining experience of my entire life.   First of all, I know there's a wait for this place. I get it. No big deal. We waited 25 minutes and sat at the bar. But when I wait 25 minutes to be seated, I expect at the very least a SATISFACTORY dining experience.   It took at least 5 minutes for a waiter to even acknowledge us.  Then they wiped down the area (sort of).   My friend ordered a turkey club with NO tomato on WHEAT with PASTA salad. He received a turkey club WITH tomato on SOURDOUR with POTATO salad. Did the kitchen staff even read the ticket? On top of that, there was maybe .25 cents worth of meat on the thing.   Overall, the place was just chaos. I felt like I was paying to watch a circus - not eat food.   At one point a waitress dropped a sausage patty and it fell on top of a basket. The thing just sat there for about 20 minutes until someone saw it . . .   There are far better breakfasts to be had at the same price, but given it's location, this establishment will never fail - even with atrocious food. I'm sure the owner is printing money, and that's a great thing, but put a little more effort into making the food better, at least."}
{"text":"Our last two visits to a Famous Toastery, including today's visit to this location, have yielded similar treatment.  After our order was delivered, we were ignored. No drink refills offered, no \"do you need anything?\", no \"is everything okay?\"  The \"every server is your server\" policy seems to have resulted in \"no server is your server.\"  The food, as usual, is very good but I do not want to have to chase down a server for an extra napkin or more coffee.  I want to be asked.  This looks kind of whiny but I suspect I am not the only one who expects attention from my server."}
{"text":"Yum yum! A great breakfast spot! It's hard to get a table sometimes, but it is well worth the wait. Delicious Cali Beni and coffee that hits the spot! We love treating ourselves to breakfast at Toast on the weekends after a trip to the farmer's market in Davidson!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Definitely a great place for brunch!! First time and I loved it. Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"The food was great, a solid 4 stars, but the service left a lot to be desired. At our original table, the A/C unit above us was dripping water on us/our table. Not a huge deal, but when we told our waitress, the manager gave us the \"what do you want me to do about it?\" Look. He was very rude, and took no responsibility. We also waited roughly 35-40 mins for our food. Overall, I would recommend based on food, but would advise a different spot based on the service."}
{"text":"This \"every server is your server\" deal was a terrible idea.    I get what they're trying to do, but I don't think this was the way to go.  But this is a first impression review so take it for what it is.    When I first sat down and the girl came to get my drink order she explained how it all worked and I thought it was a bit odd, but no biggie.   Then while she was gone to get my drink I had two more servers approach me and ask if I'd been helped, which was annoying.  Not their fault, obviously.   They didn't know who had been helped, or what had been told.     I believe that communication is key when running a business, and this place is clearly lacking.   I can appreciate that they're trying to provide excellent service, but this is NOT the right way to do it.  The servers were all confused and walking around like they weren't sure what they were supposed to be doing.  Yes, there is always someone available.  In fact for the 45 minutes that I was there I counted at least 8-12 servers on the floor at all times.  But when I actually needed something, they avoided me.   I sat for 10 minutes trying to make eye contact to ask for a re-heat on my coffee.   Then another 15 minutes just trying to get a cup of water.    I don't know if it was just because my table was off to the side or what, but I was obviously looked over.   With no assigned tables, who is to be held accountable for terrible service?  How do you know how to tip, or WHO you're tipping?  And on that note, if I worked there and had to split tips with a bunch of morons who just stood around all day I would be pretty frustrated.     I gave two stars because the food was decent.  Overpriced, but still good.  I had the French toast and a cup of coffee (coffee wasn't great, but I drink mine black so I'm a little picky)"}
{"text":"Toast was the perfect place to take our out of town guests. The staff perfectly accommodated their squirmy two year old and helped Mom keep her happy with small cups and a single pancake. Frequent beverage refills helped us focus on our conversation. While we stuck to the avocado and bacon omelets today, there were many varieties of French toast (peanut butter and banana!) that will bring us back. And with fast service and dependably brewed coffee at the ready, why not?"}
{"text":"Okay...so the food is good but not good enough to warrant the excessive wait times and chaotic name taking process. My biggest gripe is the constant confusion going on at the front of the house. It's just enough of a turn off not to go back. The 'tude you have to work through just to get a table ain't worth a super yummy sausage biscuit."}
{"text":"The food is decent but the service is awful and unorganized. I don't understand why everyone is your server - it doesn't make for faster service. You get asked the same question by every employee 10 times because no one knows what the others are doing. The servers are slow and seem to forgot what you ask them (maybe because they have 20 tables to attend).  Last time we went a spider fell out of my napkin, my coffee cup was dirty, my plate was dirty, and there were spider webs next to us.  Only thing good about this place is the $4.50 bacon egg and cheese."}
{"text":"Waited about 50 mins for my togo order. My AVOCADO OMELETTE had 2 or 3 very teeny tiny pieces of avocado in it. It was basically a omelette filled with bacon and it was VERY salty...  I love bacon as much as the next person but If it's called an AVOCADO omelette..I would expect more of the main ingredient."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has so many stars, because the two times I have been it has been highly unsatisfactory. I counted and we had 5+ people check our table. This leaves plenty of room for confusion, meal and bill errors and just pure frustration. I feel that my tip is being pooled and distributed. Sorry but that is not how it should work. I would like one server for my table for the entirety of my meal. For $9 I was brought a quiche that was flavorless and the size of my iPhone 4. I'm serious, the height and everything. The side was fruit meaning 3 pieces of melon 1 strawberry and pineapple. Kind of lame. Typically in November fruit is not the preferred choice of a side item. The bill was wrong just like it was wrong the time before. Then you have to flag down one of the 6 people you have encountered then ten minutes later maybe it will be correct. Sorry Toast Davidson I am NOT impressed."}
{"text":"Had the burrito with no tortilla. It was pretty good! Couldn't eat it all. The most important aspect of the visit was that my picky dad loved it. Miracles do happen!"}
{"text":"The food is great! We love going for brunch. The only problem is the service is awful. I have eaten here twice and both times the service left much to be desired. It took a while to take our order and no drink refills were offered.  The food came out fast once the waitress took our order."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and found Toast on Yelp.  Great local place.  Very eclectic, rustic atmosphere.  Food was very good and different.  Crowded on the weekend and a little tight inside but very worthwhile."}
{"text":"Good breakfast/brunch place. Usually packed on weekends so make sure you have the time for it. Food and service is good, they have a good breakfast menu. Price is fair."}
{"text":"Don't Believe the Hype! My boyfriend and i decided to give Toast Cafe a try after reading positive reviews about it.  Overall, Toast Cafe leaves a lot to be desired.  Our experience was as follows:  The Good: Quick friendly service The Bad: They  provide quick service at the expense of quality prepared and superb tasting food. The Ugly: The french toast was probably the biggest disappointment I have ever experienced with food.  Literally... I mean, their idea of french toast (we ordered the peanut butter banana stuffed french toast) was horrific.  Two thick slices of white bread that is probably  Texas toast style bread.  But get this, it was not grilled, it had not been dipped in the egg mixture ( maybe it was lightly brushed on as it had a hint of brown coloring), but tasted like plain thick white bread with some peanut butter slapped on it and sliced  bananas.  Just HORRIFIC.  I'm still amazed that they can call that French toast in good conscience.  I'm almost insulted.  Oh, I almost forgot that the sausage  appeared to have been pre-cooked and microwaved to serve with our meal.    Overall, nice \"hometown\" ambiance, but damn.... the food was truly lacking.  We should have gone to Waffle House....at least you know exactly what you're gonna get."}
{"text":"Just finished breakfast for lunch on our first ever visit to a famous toastery. It was excellent! The staff was friendly and attentive, the food was hot, delicious and quick! My husband had the strawberry French toast and I had the avocado omelet. Both were very tasty and portions are huge. We both took home half our meals. We can't wait to return and try their lunch menu!"}
{"text":"Food is overpriced considering the taste. Ordered burritos and were bland and flavorless, not to mention the Orange juice which was non refillable but also came in a very small glass. Bad experience overall. Our server did not even know the menu herself."}
{"text":"Food is good and service is great, but one shouldn't spend dinner money on breakfast."}
{"text":"First time eating here a few days ago, staff were incredibly nice and the food was good! The only issue I really had was the price of some of the items I felt could have been a bit cheaper, but all in all, I enjoyed everything and would recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was great, but waiter really ruined the experience for my table of five. I asked a couple questions due to dietary restrictions (being visibly pregnant, and not wanting a ton of caffeinated coffee or bacon). He literally walked away from our table and threw a menu on the floor. Overall he just had no patience and a bad attitude. When it was time to take our credit cards for the check, he disappeared forever and nobody ever came back to our table for over 20 minutes. Eventually, another staff member (manager?) came by and apologized for swiping our cards twice accidentally and finally gave them back. I don't live in Charlotte, but wouldn't be excited to go back."}
{"text":"Not overly impressed. Average.  We had been there for lunch and had a delicious wrap so we wanted to try brunch. Visited on a Sunday morning about 10 am.  Very busy and service was slow and inefficient.  Over 5 minutes to get water and coffee. Another 10 minutes before the complimentary cornbread came out. It was very good. Tender, not too sweet and warm. Served with a small container of warm, chunky apple butter (yummy). Another 10 minutes and the mains arrived. We had ordered Huevos Rancheros with sunny side up eggs. The eggs came scrambled and the server was not even aware until I pointed it out - it was her job to see if the order was correct.  I stuck with the scrambled rather than wait further.  80 percent of the plate was loose refried black beans with a few tortilla strips under the eggs and what was supposed to be pico de gallo, but was really a few chopped tomatoes with fine chopped onion and not much of it. Not what Huevos Rancheros is supposed to be. We had also ordered the Avocados Benedict. The eggs were nicely poached but served in an under-ripe (hard, tasteless) avocado half which made them difficult to eat. There was less than a teaspoon of a sauce (hollandaise?) and chopped tomato on top.  Supposed to have spices on top, but none to be found.  These special dishes were underwhelming but the \"regular\" breakfast dishes I spied on the way out looked better.  The side of fruit was simple but fresh.  Bill was $30 before tip, so pricey and not the experience or food quality we were looking for."}
{"text":"The food was good. Ordered the heuvos rancheros, it was probably a little expensive for what it was but it was still delicious and the menu was pretty extensive.  My favorite part about this experience was the staff. There dos this thing where you didn't have a particular wait or/waitress so everyone came by to see if you needed anything which meant we got really great service even though the place was packed."}
{"text":"Breakfast all day! There is a lunch menu too if you don't want breakfast. We came later in the day (2pm) and unfortunately they were sold out of crepes and cornbread :( so I had the special of lobster benedict with hashbrowns. It was really good! My BF had  lunch food-cheeseburger. Great service and it was not crowded since they close at three. We will keep it on our lunch/breakfast list : )"}
{"text":"I'm giving this three stars because the staff is really nice and attentive.  The first two times we went our order was decent , we ordered the country egg Benedict but replaced with turkey sausage and that was pretty good.  The sun room is a really nice room to have lunch or breakfast.  However, the third time we went we ordered the Greek omelette and I was disappointed.  Greek omelettes normally  have spinach in it but it tasted like they put canned spinach which is a big NO NO and the eggs tasted almost like egg beaters.  I think they should pride themselves on the freshest ingredients.  Also the food seems to come out luke warm not really hot.  Overall nice place to have breakfast.  I feel they just need need to fine tune some things like using fresher ingredients and making sure food comes out hotter."}
{"text":"You've got to try the coconut pancakes! THE BEST. It was my first visit after hearing so much buzz about Famous Toastery, I was not disappointed. The service was exceptional, food came out quickly and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I have been in a half a dozen times with my family or with friends. Always thought it was a little pricy and the food was just ok . Today finished it for me, I had the $11 lunch meat loaf and asked for some bread. I was charged $1.75  for one slice.!!!  When I brought this up to the cashier she said \"yeah that is a lot\"  but made no attempt to remove it or call a manager or anything so GOODBYE"}
{"text":"I would have rated them a 1 however the manager turned it around.  It all started with our long wait, rude waitress and ended with the wrong order.  The manager of this location is phenomanal, he made it right and apologized over and over.  One of the waiters apologized for the long delay in getting our coffee and juice.  You could tell he was sincere and was working as fast as he could, running circles around his co-workers.  In spite of all this the food was good and the Manager gets a 10+ for customer service, making the customer happy."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast! Quick and friendly service. Variety of options. Not too long of a wait on a busy Saturday or Sunday.   I like the Greek omelet and I get the hash browns grilled. They serve wonderful cornbread and apple butter as you wait.   Now for the best part: outside dog friendly seating!!!  My girlfriends and I bring our four legged counterparts here to enjoy some outside time. Tables are in the sun and shade. Servers even brought the pups a water dish!  Check out the park across the street for some doggie and people play time after to work off your delicious mean."}
{"text":"Socialist breakfast.  Overall the quality of the food is decent, but not gourmet. They serve basic breakfast foods that are prepared quickly.  Be prepared for sub-par service. The Toast business model is to use a \"team\" of floating servers, food runners, and busboys. Our first interaction was with Eric who took our order, then we never saw him again during our visit. Near the end of our breakfast (approximately 25 minutes) we had our first coffee refill. The table to our left had an issue with their meal due to the fact a wrong order was brought out and dropped off then the food runner ran away quickly and they had it sitting on their table for five minutes. The table to our other side had a patron that had to walk to the bus station to attempt to get himself a coffee refill. There is apparently no incentive to provide fast/friendly/quality service if they share the service responsibilities. We paid $28 dollars for an omelet, French toast and two coffees. A Socialist Breakfast."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  I went with a friend visiting from CT.  As a newcomer to CLT, I was not familiar with local eateries for  brunch.  I must say, the food was fabulous only to be outdone by the great staff!  Their concept of \" everyone is your waiter\"..... pure genius.  This will be my go-to place for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Excellent place. Nice and polite service. Good coffee. That place is busy, one of our favorite for a Saturday or Sunday breakfast. My favorite is Greek omelet, my wife loves the Benedict's eggs, their orange nurs juice is the best."}
{"text":"Wow great brunch any day of the week. You gotta get the crab mac n cheese! Pasta was cooked just right, sauce so creamy, and nice seafood crabby taste with chunks of crab meat. It is perfect for \"carbo loading\" before a rabies awareness run or before a good nap. Other highlights was the Cali Benny, except for the side of potatoes that came with it- boring and texture was off. Coffee was always flowing.  I would come back!"}
{"text":"So great! Don't miss a glass of the fresh squeezed orange juice. It is delicious! Stuffed French Toast is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I am from out of town and every time i come to visit South Carolina i make it a point to stop by and have lunch or breakfast. Both the drinks and food are excellent, and the staff is always so wonderful and friendly.  Being in the industry for almost 10 years its great to walk into a place that really knows what they are doing and the manager is always very attentive to both staff and guests! I highly recommend this restaurant to EVERYONE!!"}
{"text":"Went here a few times and thought was a decent breakfast spot (not great but pretty good).  This past time, our server was rude, the manager had attitude with us when a meal did not come with toast that was supposed to and we requested it, one meal was cold (they did replace and take off the bill) and a meal I had previously enjoyed was bad as well.  Wont go again.  Would rather head to Poppy's or Zada Janes."}
{"text":"Great stuffed French toast and excellent service!  Was there for lunch and this was clearly the place to be in town.  I was disappointed in the banana pudding - it was by far the prettiest I've ever seen, but lacked the substance of others.  I think it was just bananas and meringue, and I was craving a thick pudding with Nilla wafers."}
{"text":"Glad to see someone who is using tablets to order.  Every server helps every table,  everyone is nice. Immediately after getting our beverages we were delivered corn bread and apple butter. Food looks awesome,  decent serving size. Coffee is just strong enough and fresh."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Toast since they opened, and unfortunately, I think the quality of the food--and the size of the portions--has decreased. We usually order one of the lobster items, like the lobster Benedict. We loved Toast, from the service to the ingredients in the food to the sides, like the cucumber salad. However, the last two times we were in, our hashbrowns servings were so small, they almost felt like half-orders. And, they were cold--I mean REALLY cold. Even the size of the eggs seemed small, compared to what we were used to. And while before the lobster chunks were truly chunks, our last visits were more like tiny bits sprinkled in the Hollandaise. the sliced tomatoes were mushy--it was just meh overall. Part of what made Toast truly great was the portion size--if I wanted tapas, I'd be eating tapas. For breakfast or lunch/brunch, I tend to save my calories so I can indulge in large, comforting servings, and Toast always delivered there. The menu prices supported the large sizes, and we were okay with walking out of there spending almost fifty dollars on an amazing breakfast. The service is always good, I will say that. It's great you don't have to hunt for \"your\" server but can ask questions of anyone. The serving staff remains outstanding. It's become inconsistent regarding if you are offered cornbread, which used to just come with your meal without inquiring. I don't know if the place just got too popular or what, but I'm not sure we'll be back again--the items we prefer are pricey, and if the portions we experienced this time are their new normal, it's too much money for the food on your plate. So sad...we will miss it, but we're not sure if we're willing to try again for the price."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would. This was the worst restaurant experience we've ever had, we actually got up and left. Initial welcome and order taking was fine. Then server returned to say espresso machine was broken, so we ordered regular coffee. Next our orders took 30minutes to arrive and when they did they were not what we had ordered, they were all confused together. Plus they were all stone cold! Order was two scrambled eggs and toast, two scrambled eggs with mushrooms on a biscuit, two scrambled eggs with hash browns and lastly a plate of pancakes. What we got was a side of toast (not even brown), a single biscuit, three scrambled eggs with mushrooms and cheese with potatoes, and lastly two eggs over easy with potatoes on a pancake!! We tried to attract anyone's attention and eventually just left in disgust. Never going near this place again. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Super staff.   Loved it a lot.   Great little family feel place.  Really appreciated their service."}
{"text":"Amazing!  We have been going here for over 10 years, since it was located in Huntersville.  Service is always great and very fast, and the breakfast has always brought us back.    My favorites are the Avacado omelette and the Southwestern omelette."}
{"text":"While visiting Davidson College, it was recommended that we stop in here for lunch. Ordered a burger and chicken and bacon wrap-- both were delicious, service was fast and friendly-- will definitely come back when we return to this cool little town!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for area and food was just ok. Egg salad very salty and was sick to My stomach for 2 days"}
{"text":"1st timer. The ambiance is great: hometown diner, great, historic atmosphere in the little town of Davidson across the street from beautiful Davidson College. I thought the prices seemed a little high: $10 for bfasts, sandwich lunches, salads, etc but the quality and portions made the prices seem like a deal. The Spinach, mushroom, gruyere omelette with sourdough was awesome and my wife's meatloaf and grits was tremendous. We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Charlotte from SoCal and I miss my favorite b-fast spots. I decided to try Toast, since I live really close. I had \"the runner \" It was good, but didn't love it. I enjoyed their black coffee and the free corn bread was awesome, not used to having that in California. I would definitely come back again any try their French toast. :-)"}
{"text":"I order the crab cake, eggs Benedict, oven roasted potatoes and washed it down with a Mimosa!!! The plate was flavorful and plentiful! It came with three crab cakes after I discovered the 3rd one buried under the roasted potatoes!!! I truly enjoyed my meal!!!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of breakfast. Any time of day.  I was at Davidson for a conference and skipped out on one lecture to grab something to eat.   I had passed by the sign for this restaurant a few times and it looked like my kind of place - and I was right.  The breakfast was filling and tasty while the fruit dish was more fresh than typical for breakfast joints. I had the typical eggs/potatoes/toast but it was a step above what you'd find at a diner.   The service was fast and friendly. I sat at the bar but even for after 9am - the place was fairly busy.   I wasn't able to try lunch or dinner here but I imagine it would be great, as well."}
{"text":"Went for a late Saturday brunch and got seated right away.  The service was a bit hands off but not a huge issue.  I had the stuffed french toast which was delightful."}
{"text":"Quick, attentive service, great food, any server can help you. A very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I went to Toast expecting an average breakfast, but they exceeded my expecations. I ordered the stuffed strawberry french toast  (delicious). I appreciated that the french toast was not soggy. The managers were friendly."}
{"text":"Likes: Good dilworth location, little to no wait for a table, food served quickly, mimosas and bellinis are delicious and a good size for the price    Gripes: Omelets are odd. The eggs are fully cooked and then the other ingredients - cheese, vegis, etc - are entirely separate from the eggs and just folded in between plain cooked eggs. I have never had omelets like this anywhere else and the food came out so quickly that it makes me wonder if the eggs are not precooked and they just stuff the ingredients in when the order is placed. Bloody marys are mediocre. At my most recent visit, our one particular server was rude but I have not experienced this before so I am not sure what to make of that.   Bottom line: If you're in the area, it's a good place to grab a decent breakfast but this is not a restaurant that I would seek out."}
{"text":"I've given Toast 2 chances and will not be back. Both times the service has been bad, which is sad considering the disclaimer on the menu stating \"every server is YOUR server!\" Yeah? well apparently they are ALL terrible servers. The management, who was at the register the second time, had a terrible personality. I encountered the worst of the service the second time...I went in and stood at the bar (while waiting for our table) to order a Bloody Mary and some Mimosa's for my friends; after waiting at the bar (directly next to the cashier line) for 5 minutes and watching multiple servers come behind the bar and ignore me, I thought \"maybe I'm supposed to get in the register line to order.\" I got in the register line and once reaching the cashier and ordering drinks, I was told \"I can get your drink order after I clear the line, step aside.\" That was irritating, to say the least, and delivered in such a rude tone that everyone in my party had there jaws dropped when I turned to look at them. After being seated (I wanted to leave, but hey, I was starving at this point), we FINALLY were able to get our drinks. Our food was mediocre at best (both visits)...I've seen and tasted 8 different menu items so far (sampling friends food) and none of it was very impressive. Omelets are much better at Zada Jane's, Pewter Rose, even Skyland's! The french TOAST was not very flavorful and not as warm as it should have been. The actual regular TOAST (this is the name of the place) was cold and not buttered on both visits! (Of course they did give you plastic packets of butter that was cold and hard and would not spread on the also cold and hard toast). We have some great brunch places in Charlotte, for one named after a breakfast dish, Toast is awful."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast/brunch place in town. Close to home and the food is great! Love that all the waitstaff take care of you during your visit"}
{"text":"We moved to Cornelius about a year ago and this is one of our favorite breakfast spots.    Likes: atmosphere (always busy on weekends), good food and right in the heart of downtown Davidson.    Tips: on the weekends you'll want to allow time for the line out the door - There's been 20-40 min wait many weekends..  However they do a great job of handling the crowd (they're fast but don't rush us out the door)."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff and the food was amazing... Everything was soooo fresh and delicious. I highly recommend the orange juice and cranberry mix drink. I wish I remembered one waitress in particular that went above and beyond... she was so helpful and sweet. Very welcoming!!"}
{"text":"Great service and ambiance. I can see why this is a popular spot with the community. It's close to Davidson College and downtown Davidson.   Sat at the bar and my server was courteous and attentive especially with the coffee refills. I ordered the  Lobster Scramble. The potatoes were a little overcooked, but not bad. The lobster scramble had the right amount of cheese and lobster pieces in which I didn't fee like I was being short changed for the price. Overall good experience and recommend it to anyone who's in town. Recommend getting there before 9 since when I was leaving, the place was filling up. This was a weekday so I can even imagine the weekend."}
{"text":"I got a basic breakfast - scrambled eggs, grits, and toast. Good portions. Well made. The orange juice tasted fresh squeezed and was delicious. The place wasn't too full, but my service was slow to take my order. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time. Parking was good, but might be tight if the restaurant is busier. I was there around 9:15 am on a Wednesday. You pay on the way out and that went quickly."}
{"text":"We tried Toast this morning for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it!  The food was much better than I had expected and the service was courteous and speedy (the \"every server is your server policy was interesting).  The only knock against I can say is the check was kind of slipped in without either of us noticing it!"}
{"text":"Dry hash browns, average omelettes, ridiculously high prices for breakfast. My two teens and I - $65!!!!!!! All due to extra charges. We could have had full hton breakfast buffet at that price. Very disappointed - breakfast is my favorite meal but I'll never go back here!"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, I attempted to give Toast another shot after my first mediocre experience.  Sad face. The quiche was literally the worst I have ever had. There was a fruit fly in my drink.  Based on some of the other reviews, I am apparently not the only one who has had this happen.  Way overpriced.  It is too bad because I love breakfast and look forward to a morning out on a weekend with good food and friends."}
{"text":"Visited my first Famous Toastery a couple months ago. I can't remember the exact name of the dish but it was on the specials menu....scrambled eggs with lobster. It was the best breakfast meal of my life. Made me think of the Seinfeld episode where Kramer makes everyone lobster eggs. Anyway, great food."}
{"text":"These folks have it together as far as freshness goes in breakfast and sandwiches.  It's all cooked to order from great ingredients, handled with care,  but I can't enjoy food that I can make at home for a fraction of the cost. I mean $12 for pancakes?   It's very noisy too-- tin ceiling, hard floors and walls.  Not good for conversation, unless you scream. At my last visit, five waiters cruised back and forth through the nearly empty room refilling salt shakers, etc. leaving me alone, but would have been nice if one had brought the coffee pot by.  This is probably a fluke, and won't keep me away.    The owners are from NYC and brought the prices with them. If you're on a tourist's budget and  have money to burn, you'll get a good meal here."}
{"text":"I usually give a restaurant three tries before I say I will never go back.  I've broken that rule for this restaurant because it is always so busy.  I have to say that totally baffles me.  I have been there at least five or six times and never had good food or decent service.   Part of the problem is there is no one server responsible for you table and if no one is responsible, no one takes responsibility to ensure you have coffee and your ordered food.  Today was the last straw.  I was seated quickly, my order taken quickly and then sat for almost an hour with no food and no check in from the server who had taken my order.  I finally flagged him down so I could pay for my coffee and leave.  To his credit, he did not charge me for my coffee.  Dine here at your own risk."}
{"text":"Nearly everything about my experience was a huge disappointment.  Having been to the original restaurant in both Huntersville and Davidson I expected a bit of a wait going during the weekend at 10am, but a 30+ minute wait while at least there were at least a half dozen empty tables is inexcusable.  And things didn't get any better later in the day, I saw people waiting for more then 30 minutes when we left after 12 with just as many tables sitting empty.  Then if was nearly 10 minutes before someone came to take a drink order and they disappeared before we could place a food order.  So 20 minutes later we finally got our order in.  But 45 minutes after that our food still hadn't arrived.  The waiter said it would be coming right out and it did, but it was cold.  So I doubt I will be back.  It's a shame because I loved the original Toast but I have heard some bad reviews of the franchisees."}
{"text":"Called ahead to see if we could reserve a table for two and unfortunately, we couldn't. Knowing that it would be busy that morning, it was worth a try.  We waited no more than five minutes and had a table ready for us. The staff was friendly and speedy. The food was good.  The establishment is lovely and would love to visit again. Could be my next  favorite cafe :)  Update 12/17  Unfortunately, price has gone up and portion has gone drastically down. It's so sad that the plates are still the same size and the food has shrunk significantly.  A substitute of berries only in a fruit bowl is $2 extra on top of the cost of the fruit bowl which often makes it over $6 for a tiny bowl of fruit."}
{"text":"Long wait. Eggs were served still clear where they normally are white. The food around the eggs was good. Server noticed the raw eggs on a side plate (I wasn't going to say anything). Since asked, I explained the obvious. They made new eggs.  Those were raw too. I didn't say anything but can't go back."}
{"text":"Our Parents of Allergic Kids members were discussing where to go for breakfast. Many of our members said they had been to Famous Toastery. It is always great to find restaurants that are inclusive of the food allergic community. Thank you for your support!"}
{"text":"This place is such a gem.  I love their brunch and look forward to whatever specials they've got cooked up.  My favorite is the Turkey Scramble.  They do a great job with providing healthy options and plenty of variety.  I recently tried the Sweet Potato Hash which was also delish.  You can't go wrong here.  The food and service are consistently great!"}
{"text":"Folks, it's hard to beat this place.   The food speaks for itself and the service matches the food too.  Wait staff is always pleasant and prompt.  You will wait to get seated, but isn't that typical of places that are so good?  Always, I mean always, challenge your palate and get one of their brunch specials.   You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The food was good, we were seated within 5 minutes of giving our name and we did not have to wait long for our food.  Well, actually, our food was served rather quickly....cooked to order.  I was pleased by the vegetarian and vegan offerings.  My Cali Benny was perfect and the fresh red potatoes were delish. The wait staff were attentive and did not disappoint. A great way to start your day...good breakfast and good service."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend for breakfast.  Both of us must eat gluten-free, so that's why we chose this spot.  We were quite happy with our choice!  The GF french toast was great, though the GF flapjack was a little bland...  They also offer GF bread for sandwiches.  We sat outside, which is best, as the inside can be pretty noisy.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Please step up your game. The breakfast we had was underwhelming for the price we paid. Beautiful restaurant and convenient location for us but we left feeling sad."}
{"text":"I don't understand what the hype is....the food is just okay. Nothing spectacular. Wanted to love it but until they can produce a special breakfast I'm not coming back. Sorry..."}
{"text":"Food and service was fantastic! I had the country breakfast that had a split biscuit, country ham on each one, an egg cooked how you like and sausage gravy poured all over it with a side of home style potatoes and an orange wedge. Delish! The hubby had the omelet special that included smoked sausages (big chunks), portobello mushrooms and swiss. He loved it. Our friend had the spinach and feta quiche. She didn't complain bc she had an empty plate afterwards. The wait was a bit long but that's bc everyone knows how good it is! So worth the wait. Oh, and I had fresh oj with pulp that was good too!!"}
{"text":"Engagement party was hosted here and they did an excellent job with drinks and drink selection, great dinner choices with burgers and veggies.  The wait staff made sure everyone was having a great time and were excellent hosts."}
{"text":"We have been to Toast in Davidson and the experience has been very different. The service is a little much at times, we had at least 3 different waiters come by to ask if everything is okay every 5 min or so. I am all about good services, but at some point let us try to enjoy the food and company.   I had the strawberry cream french toast, and it was so sweet my teeth hurt. The spinach omelet was good overall. Overall the cost was pretty high for this type of breakfast, in comparison for the same price tag I could have gone to Zada Janes (you know what I mean if you have been there before) :)  The atmosphere could be warmer, like the Davidson one. I hope they will be able to deliver the same quality and feeling the original location has.  I will try it again soon, and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"As a walked in it was crowed! However we only had to wait about 10 min anyway. I order the chicken salad and I loved their homemade dressing but the salad it's self was not that good. I also felt it was a little pricey. I paid 3 dollars for a glass of orange juice that tasted like something from the store. I loved the service though we had people checking on us all the time.  Over all"}
{"text":"Finally!  A restaurant that can make an omelet without browning it!  Great breakfast with great service.  Priced a little high, but still a winner."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Sunday brunch. Bloody Mary was very tasty!  Ordered Cali Benny with Canadian ham (extra). It was delicious.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Good place to meet friends for breakfast, little spendy and not super keen that waitstaff are unassigned to specific tables. Sometimes makes things confusing but can be nice in that you can grab anyone to help you.   Food 7/10 - nothing spectacular but doesn't mean it isn't good, offers a good menu selection of standard breakfast food. Price: $$$ - little more expensive than I like, especially when it's a family of four. Big Pro: They offer gluten free flapjacks and gf toast. Will continue to eat here over other places close by."}
{"text":"This is another place with a huge local following I don't understand. I've hands down had better food at IHOP. Seriously, I don't understand all these amazing reviews and ridiculous wait times. I have been trying to go here for a few months because I've heard so much about it, but its always jammed to the gills so we can't get in with under an hour wait. It was such a let down. I got the \"raspberry stuffed french toast\"- this is a grilled jam sandwich (no where on the menu did it indicate the stuffing is cheap jam, not fresh berries) No matter how much powdered sugar you put on it, it wont magically turn into french toast. It hadn't been dipped in the egg batter for more than a second- naked bread was visible everywhere.  Not wanting a literal 8oz grilled jam sandwich, I very politely asked one of our servers (we had two, it was strange) if i could switch it for regular french toast, since there was no egg batter on the french toast and the stuffing was really disappointing.   Both servers made it my fault their french toast didn't have batter on it (\"sorry you didn't like it, the stuffed french toast uses a lot of bread, that's just how it is\"...no, had it been made properly, I wouldn't have said anything, but the whole point of french toast is soaking it in the egg batter first, which didn't happen). They still never understood what I meant, and made me feel like a jerk their cook was having an off morning or too lazy to whip up some more french toast batter. For $9, that should be the best three pieces of french toast I've ever had.  The fruit cup was $2.50 for literally six pieces of melon with two blue berries. The side of toast was cold without butter. My bacon was so floppy and greasy, I took one bite and wanted to throw up.   My finance got the egg white omelet with brie and some other veggies, cant remember the name but he liked it. It was big and looked good but I'm not an omelet person.   The decor here is something you'd see in a 1992 rural diner- lots of fake greenery, silk flowers, and flower decor everywhere, hokey over priced paintings for sale on every wall, fake vines strewn throughout, yep, I'm still at a total loss why people are in love with this place.  Overall I won't be back due to the over priced mediocre food and college kid servers that haven't learned much about working in a restaurant (even if i had hated my food for a totally invalid reason, its not good customer service to blame the customer, especially when its a kitchen error). You can find me at IHOP, the food is better, cheaper and more variety. And its not covered in those disgusting dusty plastic vines, I hate those."}
{"text":"Out of all the breakfast places I have went, this was always superior. We come here for breakfast on weekends, and they are very great. Their service is always beyond average and deliver food in the blink of an eye. But the food is also the G.O.A.T. The potatoes and basically everything here is good. If you like breakfast, you've got to come here."}
{"text":"We've been here twice for breakfast. We sit at the bar at the bar and the service has been very good as has the food - putting it on the rotation."}
{"text":"Good food...We had breakfast food and everything was great...but no better than IHOP at x2 the price.  This restaurant is open for breakfast and brunch and is located in a high rent area around Concord Mills.  The limited hours and location may explain the ridiculous high prices.  Really $80 after tip for family of 4 to have pancakes!!!!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm going to write this review for those of you that live closer to Toast than I do.  I'm not that far away...as in...Rock Hill...but I won't likely travel to frequent this breakfast location.  Why not?  Well, the food isn't as spectacular as some are making it out to be.  Don't get me wrong, it's good...just not as good as what we have near my house.  What do you mean?  The hash...the main component of the dish ordered...just not good.  Very little corned beef.  Just sort of plain tasting.  The biscuit.  Are these premade?  Your gravy tasted great...the biscuit?  Not so much.  So why four stars?  The ambiance, the decor, the service...all five stars.  The rest of the food was pretty decent as well.  Nothing I'm writing home about....but still good.  If I lived near Toast, I'd likely give it many tries as I like the potential.  TBH, this place will thrive due to its location and the fact that they have some uppity sounding dishes on the menu.  They're a perfect fit for the local community.  Try:  Their bacon...they cook it perfectly  Avoid:  The corned beef hash"}
{"text":"Great sourdough bread on the club sandwich.  Slightly expensive for food but nice dining atmosphere.  All the attendants were courteous and some staff asked for feedback on the food quality.  Great start and an eatery option for Huntersville.  It has lost some of the cozy atmosphere of the original Tast restaurant where Cafe 100 is currently located."}
{"text":"I came for breakfast at about 9am on a Saturday morning. It was a little busy but not terribly packed.  The service was excellent, from the hostess to the busboy.   GET THE COFFEE.  I can't stress enough how good the coffee is. I had The Usual omelet which was sausage cheese and onion. It came with stone ground grits and toast. Before the food came the server brought two slices of cornbread with apple butter. Yum! I was only disappointed with the side of bacon. It had good flavor but it was soft and a little cold.    It is a little pricey... My one meal cost $20 with tip. For breakfast that's a bit much but considering the quality of the food, I guess you get what you pay for. All in all an enjoyable experience I can recommend for friends! Check them out."}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast here the past two Sundays and it was terrific each time. The food is so good and the place was packed! The first time, service was stellar but the second time it was a bit weak. (did I say it was very busy?) I love The avocado omelet, and I have enjoyed the grits and home fries. Large portions, fresh ingredients, and yummy flavors. Best breakfast if a bit pricey."}
{"text":"The food it great! The people are really funny, they joke with with you! The food usually comes out fast!  Everything I have eaten there it delicious! My top three is definitely the French toast, pancakes, and waffles. The only thing is while I was visiting NC we went to this restaurant for breakfast 4 times. I order chocolate milk each time. The first time they gave me a large chocolate milk. The other 3 times they gave me a small one even after I ordered a large. But this place it on if the best breakfast places I have ever been!"}
{"text":"Staff is great.  Food is wonderful and reasonably priced.  The avacado omlet is my favorite.  So good!"}
{"text":"This place is a breakfast gem because...its HUGE! No more waiting in line to get a seat at your fav little breakfast spot.   They pretty much just serve up your average breakfast fare, nothing too creative or out of the box--but it was very good.   Tons of sunlight pouring through on the inside and few tables on their front steps for outside dining. There's also plenty of parking = win."}
{"text":"I had the privilege of dining at Toast this morning and cannot wait for my next meal there. I was a bit intimidated by the line that went right outside the restaurant but luckily my dining companion had a seat waiting for me at the bar. We have a tradition of typically meeting for breakfast and decided to try Toast for a change of pace.   We were greeted by a basket of corn bread with a side of what tasted and looked like apple butter with a hint of citrus. We ordered some coffee and preceded to rack our brains over the menu. We both decided to go for the scrambled egg, goat cheese, tomato, guacamole, and bacon wrap--minus the wrap. Even though they were incredibly busy, they filled our special order and we received a beautiful scramble with a side or sour cream and salsa. The scramble was a delicious balance of cheese to egg to bacon to guacamole to tomato. Cooking eggs is truly very difficult and these were a perfect soft scramble. We left feeling full and completely satisfied.   I definitely believe that breakfast is the most important meal of the day and dining at Toast will start your day off right. Even in their rush, the staff was friendly and I certainly never saw the bottom of my coffee cup. They offer brunch, lunch, and dinner and I am eager to try their dinner fare!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is quite disappointing.  I have eaten here twice with a very similar experience both times.   The food and pricing are the biggest problems.  It is overpriced and average in everyway.  Both the breakfast and lunch were boring.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Brian has done it again by bringing this establishment back to Huntersville. It was completely packed, but the wait was only 20 minutes. Fast turnover, but delicious food.  Our group included three kids and they all inhaled their meals. The three adults had a mix of breakfast and lunch items. Everyone was completely satisfied and ready for our return trip."}
{"text":"Ate here on a cold winter day. Very crowded and rather noisy.  Lots of cold draft from the ever-opening and closing front door.  Wait staff was very good.  They got the orders in and out in spite of the large amount of people.  Got the eggs Florentine.  The eggs were well cooked, but it came with a glob of home fries that lacked seasoning.  My cohort had the Crab Benedict.  Eggs were well prepared except they didn't drain the eggs well enough and the crab cake below was soggy. The meal came with stale, cold cornbread in a plastic bowl - how charming.  The coffee was great though.  The biggest disappointment came last - the bill.  This place is overpriced.  I can say that they do have the basics down and with a little more attention to detail, this place could be great.  Won't be in a big hurry to go back, but if I'm in the area I might try them again."}
{"text":"I have been here couple of times on weekends. Not easy to get a quick seat. There is always a wait time. Service gets choppy sometimes,on weekends because of the crowd. But this is not a deal breaker for me.  Food is amazing. I ordered Runner Omelette multiple times. The roasted potatoes with seasoning on the side is a must. Don't miss it. I will come back as many times as I can. Nice place to start your weekend for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"I ordered the breakfast combo which included French toast, one egg and bacon. The French toast was good, but the bacon was really tough and over cooked. The coffee was very good. The service was good. The restaurant was only 1/4 full and was incredibly loud. It was at best average. I'm not fond of paying $15 for an average breakfast. I will mark this one off my list. Next."}
{"text":"I come here every weekend for breakfast, and have yet to write a review. I've never been disappointed with anything here! I travel often, and have yet to find a better breakfast. Love this place"}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant. Food is pricey but tasty. Tables are small but staff is very attentive. I recommend the shrimp and grits and pancakes."}
{"text":"I love this place, while my husband is not impressed  Download Valpak APP for the buy one get one half off coupon. I personally dislike seeing coupons like that and would prefer lower prices.  This place is pricey with plates running $10 to $14 (breakfast)"}
{"text":"This is a town favorite. All my friends love this place and wish more would open close by! Great food, charming, friendly, fast"}
{"text":"Recent visits to Toast; food has been \"so so\". I'm posting this review mainly for the staff service. We had a party of (7) from out of town, and 90% of the staff appeared unwelcoming and inhospitable. A question about how the hash browns were cooked was met with frowns instead of figuring out how to correct the \"problem\". For the poor service alone, we will no longer patronize this location (the food at the Davidson location is great!)."}
{"text":"Wonderful clean restaurant for a nice Sunday breakfast. Friendly staff great food! A little pricey, but not enough to prevent another visit! Good quality and quantity."}
{"text":"I am a fan of toast and been to the Ballantyne location many times. This location is more low keyed and more quiet than its sister locations."}
{"text":"We don't make our way up to the Lake Norman area nearly as often as we would like but this weekend was a very special occasion, Ella and I delivered a Wedding Cake to the Peninsula Club. After 48 hours of intense baking, decorating, and packaging we turned a whole lot of butter and powdered sugar into a Two Tiered Wedding Cake, 300 Lemon Zest Cupcakes, and 300 White Chocolate dipped and hand decorated Cake Pops.  After being secluded from the rest of the world for 2 days we had worked up quite the appetite and after delivering the Wedding Cake we were on the hunt for some grub. With my Urbanspoon app in hand I started searching for some quick options and stumbled on Toast Cafe as being one of the highest rated restaurants in the area. With almost 500 votes, an 87% score, and only being a couple miles from us we were sold and on our way to Toast Cafe.  Its rained in the Queen City nearly every day in the last month... today was no different. When we got there the monsoon was in full swing but we were lucky enough to park right across the street and run inside before getting completely soaked. The lighting inside was abysmal and we felt like if we worked there we would have to bring a damn flashlight with us to work everyday just to see our way around (slight exaggeration but you get the point). The only seating with even remotely decent lighting was the bar seating closest to the front windows... obviously the spot for us :)  After looking through the menu again, and again, and again... we decided to go with the chipotle sweet potato and corn soup, the pesto risotto, and the boursin burger.  The chipotle sweet potato and corn soup came to the table first and was a welcome site given the monsoon taking place outside. We loved the soup but were really hoping for the chipotle to be a more noticeable flavor to balance the sweetness of the sweet potato and corn. Even without the chipotle the soup was delicious and we ate every last bite.  The spinach pesto risotto was a phenomenal blend of flavors that were super creamy, cheesy, and had the perfect soft risotto texture (unlike the spackle Im used to being served). I was a little concerned that it would't be enough for an entree because it only cost $6 but I actually had enough to take home and enjoy the next day for lunch.  The Boursin Burger came topped with lettuce, tomato, black pepper boursin, thick bacon, champagne caramelized sweet onions and garlic mayo on fresh baked ciabatta style buns with a side of fresh greens petite house salad. Knowing I wanted to \"save the best bite for last\" I dove straight into my salad and got it out of the way first so I could make more space for the boursin beauty that had been presented in front of me. The salad was good (Im not really a fan of mixed greens salads) and it came with a generous portions of shredded cheese and a light touch of ranch dressing but who cares??? Not me, this is all about the Boursin Burger!  I'm a self proclaimed burger aficionado and I can say with the utmost confidence that this is one of the best burgers I have ever eaten! The bun was light and warm, the grilled onions were sweet, and the bacon was delightfully thick... but what set this burger apart was the mouthwatering black pepper boursin. Not only does the boursin obviously taste delicious but it brought the burger together and amplified its neighboring ingredients to a higher level. This is an easy recommendation and a new addition to my Foodies Favorites List :)  Just when we thought the night couldn't get any better our waitress said the chef wanted us to try their most popular dessert (Frannie's Chocolate Delight). Not wanting to be rude and carefully trying to hide any excitement about taking advantage of free dessert we pondered for a second and said... Hell Yeah!  Frannie's Chocolate Delight is a artfully delivered combination of brownies, chocolate cake, chocolate pudding, espresso, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and a generous supply of whipped cream. Our's came with nearly completely melted ice cream but we inhaled it so quick it didn't make much of a difference. The abundance of chocolate on top of chocolate with more chocolate with whipped cream and ice cream was the perfect ending to our already deliciously memorable meal.  Toast Cafe made us regret not making it up to Lake Norman more often. The Queen City is full of amazing restaurants (most of which we have already visited) but if you venture just a few minutes outside of the 4-85 ring you will still find an array of top notch restaurants. Toast Cafe was a quick favorite of ours and we cant wait to hit them up next time for breakfast. Fervent Foodie recommends the southwest chorizo scramble and the peanut-butter-banana-stuffed French toast... both of which we can't wait to sink our teeth into!"}
{"text":"Bad service and food is way over priced $31.00 bucks for two people for breakfast. Food Tate ok but eggs taste powered and food is defiantly not worth 31 for breakfast."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Super quaint extremely friendly. Atmosphere great staff outstanding. Food was close to perfection and nice variety. Keep it classic or try something different. Drinks like mimosa and bloody Mary are on point. Will definitely return. Highly reccomend. Check em out if in area. Won't leave hungry great portions. Highly reccomend hash browns #delicious"}
{"text":"We went with about 6 people and sat outside on the patio underneath the tree.  The outside patio was really nice and it is located near downtown Davidson.  For us...that was About all of the positives.  Service was very slow, our waiter confused our drink order.  I got the stuffed French toast with strawberries and cream cheese.  It was all cream cheese - a big goop of cream cheese with a little bread and a few strawberries is not what I had in mind.  Others ordered breakfast food like the eggs Benedict and and omelet - no one was impressed.  Overall disappointed in the meal.  Most likely will not return."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for brunch. Wow was this place good!!! I ordered a biscuit and gravy to start and it was amazing. THEN I ordered the pancakes and they were great. My wife order a crab special breakfast sandwich which was good as well. We will definitely come here again when in the area."}
{"text":"Every Sunday after church my sisters and I usually go and have brunch. It's always the usual, \"where do you wanna go this time?\" With the usual response, \"I don't know\". And then we would usually hit up a safe spot with Vietnamese cuisine. Sometimes we would take a chance and go try an American restaurant. We usually don't go because honestly most of them are hit and misses. The option was between terrace cafe and the famous toastery. I had told my sisters I had already gone to terrace cafe that week and it wasn't somewhere I was jumping the chance to go again. We yelped brunch restaurants and found toast of dilworth.   When we got there there was about a 30 minute wait for the next available table. Meaning any table either inside or outside. There were people waiting inside and outside. It was crazy. We were about to leave thinking that the wait was way too long but decided to stick it through. Since we were with the kids we chose that option and got a table outside. They also allow dogs outside too! Although it was super hot and humid that afternoon, our servers made sure to check on us to make sure we were alright. I said servers because they have this policy where everyone of their servers are ours as well, which is pretty nice.   Although the place was jam packed busy, our food came out in a nice and timely manner. We didn't expect that. Our food looked great as well. It was definitely Instagram worthy. This review is about the service and the food. Our main server was great. I think his name was Danny. He was knowledgeable and personable and everything you would want in a server. And the food. Omg! So good. Although people would say that it's \"just breakfast\", there are two ways that could end up. It could end up just okay or absolutely delicious. Famous Toastery ended up delicious. The kids even liked it and they're so picky.   This will definitely be our go to brunch cafe from now on. Great quality food and service for quality prices. I mean, what more can you want?"}
{"text":"Wo! Tasty burgers, good gluten free options, great local beer selection. Power went out 3/4 thru diner (BIG thunderstorm).  No hassle next to the window, but comp'd a bunch of our meal anyway."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to give the place a meh review, because I was really looking forward to its opening. That spot needed something besides another bank or private tutoring center. That being said...    First off, seven dollars for some eggs and grits? Those had better be some amazing eggs and grits. Nope. Not even close. My \"over-medium\" eggs were runny and the whites still a bit raw. The grits were just grits. Bland, boring. No seasoning or anything.   Added some meh sausage for $3.30 and another $2.30 for coffee, and I'm looking at $13 after tax for a very basic breakfast with zero pizazz. Y'all need to go have breakfast at the Flying Biscuit down on Park Road in Charlotte and see how they do things. As it stands, I don't think I will be back for another boring breakfast or an $11 cheeseburger for lunch."}
{"text":"After many years of visiting Toast, figured it was time to update my review.  Not much has changed with my love for Toast. My husband and I still split things every time we come. And the avocado omelette is still God's gift to the world.   The mimosas here are awesome and made with fresh squeezed orange juice! They have lots of stuffed French toasts that we also like. On our most recent visit we split the avocado omelette (pro tip- they put it on two plates) and ordered one piece of stuffed banana and peanut butter french toast. Perfect combo!"}
{"text":"5/29 So they told us the wait was 30 minutes and it's now been over a hour. The entire outside patio had dirty tables covered in plates and cups from the previous patrons and have been sitting that way since we got here (1 hour) ago. The inside is full of dirty tables as well that no one seems to be cleaning up. This place wonders why there is so many people waiting a hour to sit down. It's so bad that a guy waiting with his family started cleaning the tables up so people could get seated to eat. There is also only 4 waiters and about 100 people here at the moment. The staff is rude and unfriendly and this will definitely be my last time at this place. The only person that was respectful and polite was the worker wearing the sandals and also our waitress. Took 3 hours just to eat breakfast from start to finish.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Oh lastly the omelet was made with bacon bits."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely fabulous Cobb salad for brunch--one of the best Cobb's I've ever had (that might sound like faint praise, but they're harder to do well than you might think).  The vinaigrette was superb.  Definitely coming back.  The service was quick, even for Sunday brunch, and we only had to wait 20 minutes for a table.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"It's a good place to eat... Sometimes the food is great, sometimes it's ok. The atmosphere is nice and very homely."}
{"text":"Toast has always treated me and my family right. Whenever my parents visit from out of state, they end up breakfasting here EVERY MORNING, and with good reason - everything is delicious! Bacon is thick and flavorful, and easily ordered to your liking (I.e. extra crispy, please!) Egg dishes are also good, but to my mind, the real star of the menu is the pancakes. The pancakes are highly-customizable...while there are a few specific versions offered on the menu, the servers explained to me that you can get them with any mix of ingredients that you prefer. My favorite? Banana + blueberry, yo! Always piping hot, full of your desired mix-ins, super fluffy and served with REAL maple syrup.  On one earlier visit, the kitchen did make a mistake and sent out my banana pancakes with nuts included (before I knew they'd put whatever you want in, I used to order the banana nut pancakes sans nuts). A server came by and noticed that I was picking the nuts out (which, it should be noted, were fresh and plentiful in number), and *insisted* on having the kitchen make me a new batch, correctly - even though I hadn't brought up the issue or made any big fuss. I thought that was pretty great customer service (also noted: my replacement 'cakes came out lightning fast). I also reeeeally like the 'every server is your server' policy.  Seriously, Toast - thanks for all the noms."}
{"text":"I would only give 2 stars if it was solely based on service. We had to wait quite a bit longer than we were told from the hostess and the servers were not too friendly. Also, not too fond of them allowing dogs around the patio seating as one huge, furry dog came up and you could see hair going everywhere as we were trying to eat. If this might be bothersome to you as well, I would definitely suggest sitting inside.   The Omelet with avocado was AMAZING though. Probably the best omelet I have ever had."}
{"text":"I've only eaten at Toast for breakfast. The food is fine.   But $9.00 for pancakes and $10.00 for stuffed French toast (which at Toast is just jelly between the bread)? If this was French toast made from a wonderful egg challah and stuffed with fresh fruit and maybe a fresh fruit syrup?  Heck yes, I wouldn't squabble with $10 or more.  Toast is asking too much for the product they deliver.   For my breakfast dining dollars, Toast will not be my choice going forward."}
{"text":"I tried Toast for the first time this past weekend and would definitely recommend it.  I came in for brunch with a friend, and yes, there was about a 15 minute wait, but they served us coffee in the meantime.  And they offer you corn bread and apple butter as soon as you're seated - a great start. It's a much bigger space than I expected, and they really efficiently take care of everyone with the team service.  Even though some other reviews have noted that you don't get to develop a relationship with the servers,  they were all incredibly friendly and helpful so it really didn't matter to me.  We got omelettes and a side of french toast and everything was great.  It was exactly what we wanted and served incredibly quickly but without rushing us.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great menu selection. Lots of options for everyone's taste buds. Great Service from a well-trained staff. The only thing I didn't like is that I got a side order of fruit and it was molded and they served it and you could clearly see the white mold all over the fruit."}
{"text":"First time coming to this restaurant and i have to say i am not impressed.  I heard they start you out with fresh cornbread...finished eating and still did not receive oursI ordered the stuffed cream cheese and strawberry french toast. ..one side of bread was cooked other wasn't.  Very disappointing.  Good coffee."}
{"text":"Avocado omelet was really unique and really good. Enjoyed the coffee. Pancakes were terrific. We liked having multiple people available to serve, refill drinks, etc. Nice experience and will return again soon!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the best it has great kind caring people. And the food is awesome and quick!! So I recommend famous Toasery"}
{"text":"Breakfast is amazing, but price points are higher so brunch here is a splurge.    Love the avocado benedict that is usually featured in some variation on their specials. Peanut butter and banana stuffed French toast is delicious and highly indulgent!"}
{"text":"Great place, great service, great food. This was my first time here for brunch and I previously yelped it beforehand so I knew what I wanted the lobster eggs Benedict. I didn't see the item on the menu and asked our waiter about it and was told it was a weekend special item which was totally fine because I wanted to try other items as well that was on the menu but the waiter was nice enough to go back to the kitchen to see if they can make it happen and that was really sweet of him. Hashbrowns are delicious and the flapjacks are so good and fluffy. Overall great first experience"}
{"text":"I was happy to also have a new neighborhood restaurant by concord mill especially breakfast since options were pretty slim for something different than Denny's or Cracker Barrel. I went an hr before lunch and boy did the crowd grow in that I heard lots of people saying this was there first time! I got seated right away with a smile and you can pretty much sit where you like. The servers are everywhere and \"every server is your server\" so just raise your hand and over they come!  You can order anything anytime of the day except dinner because the close at 3!  I ordered fresh ground coffee, and their crabcake quiche with a fruit salad.  The crabcake came out in 5 min, fast right, obviously pre made! My first two bite were crab free and then the next three so I summoned the manager kindly and he described how it should be and said if I was not pleased he would get me another with a smile! The next came out in 5 min, had lots of crab and was popping hot! They check on you tons which I like, when it gets busy it's loud I won't come running back but it's a cute place to grab quick Saturday bfast or lunch with friends!"}
{"text":"Good fresh food nice atmosphere but a bit noisy.  Servers were friendly but nothing special.  I had half Sandwich and salad which is not on the menu.  a bit pricey for what you get.  Better food down the block."}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight. Service was very good and much improved. Dinner was okay, just okay."}
{"text":"Great western omelet! Hash browns are great and I would definitely recommend the cinnamon raison bread and raspberry jelly! Service was A+ as well, coffee never ran dry."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time at Toastery. Overall, both experiences have been pleasant. The service has been very good and food good. They bring cornbread and apple butter to every table to start, which i enjoy. This time, I had the shrimp and grits. The flavor was good, however it wasn't very hot. My husband got the southwestern omelette as he always does, and it's good. Portions are large. He also ordered he fresh squeezed OK which was good, but we didn't realize it's $4.50! Kinda pricey for OJ without any champagne! I'm glad we have a nice breakfast place in Gilead now!"}
{"text":"Just okay! Their pancakes and French toast were both meh at best! Lacks flavor and the French toast are as thin as sandwich bread. I should have known coming in when the place was empty that it probably wasn't good. I tried the dilworth location a couple months back and their food is exactly the same but I was hoping for a different outcome. Next time I will be going to outback or Cracker Barrel. I have no idea how they keep expanding."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, good portions and good food. Staff was friendly. Too many condiments on the table and the 94 health score was a little disappointing. Minor issues and we will be back."}
{"text":"This Toastery is not like the others. Service was good but they have major quality problems. Went for brunch with spouse and had a really poor experience.   Ordered orange juice. Glass was dirty and there was something black floating in the juice. Sent it back. Lady had to sort through 4-5 glasses to find one that was clean. Came back and there were black specs in the juice again. Food was pretty bland.   We have been to the Toastery in Davidson a number of times and it has always been nice with no issues and good food. Not sure what is going on in the Huntersville one.   Don't recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for the first time a few weeks ago on a weekday for lunch. We've heard great things and this place ALWAYS has a line out the door any other time.   The staff was very nice and attentive. I like that everybody is pretty much your server so you can ask anyone for help. The ambiance was pretty good - A little rustic/cottage-y vibe.  My issue with this place was that it was really expensive- especially for items that shouldn't be. It was like $12 or $14 for a turkey sandwich. Is this Tom Brady's personal turkey they're serving? And it only came with chips I believe. I feel a $14 turkey sandwich should come with a side of a cheeseburger that comes with a side of fries. And a pickle. I have a friend who is very well off and even she was like \"they're so expensive.\" I ended up having biscuits and gravy since it was the cheapest thing they had that could be considered a meal. My wife got a sandwich and she said it was ok. The biscuits and gravy were actually really good but not good enough to want to come back.   I can see how this is one of a few places that you can have a quality breakfast/brunch in the area, so maybe that's why they're always packed? That and they do have great service."}
{"text":"The omelettes and biscuit and gravy was awesome! Some of the best biscuit and gravy!!!"}
{"text":"We just moved out to Fort Mill and were thankful to find a great lunch/brunch spot close to home. Their club sandwich if huge with some of the best bacon on it I have ever had. My husband gets that or the salmon bagel which has great smoked salmon and fresh tomatoes. Their breakfast burrito and chicken salad sandwich have also been great. They do team service so everyone is always checking on you. Overall great food and casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this restaurant for breakfast on Easter morning and I was pleasantly surprised. Freshly baked corn bread was brought to the table and served with apple butter. That was a hit with everyone. Also, I noticed that there was a machine making freshly squeezed orange juice. I had hash browns and turkey sausage patties (no links) they were the size of hamburger patties and I had to give one to my husband. The hash browns were made with chunks of red potatoes. I was able to add saluted bell peppers and onions to it. It was pretty good. My mother-in-law ordered the Rueben and she loved it. Everyone else had the usual fare, pancakes, bacon (turkey and pork), sour dough toast, and eggs. All were happy with their meals and would return. It was a little pricey with most entrees costing approximately $10."}
{"text":"Heard a lot o great things but was a bit disappointed. Good food and great staff but quite noisy, really limited parking and prices too high.  May go back but will be a while."}
{"text":"Just ok! Pancakes have zero flavor! Taste like I made it from a box. The French toast was ok but I won't be back for it. The servers are nice but the food is subpar and overpriced. I could go to Cracker Barrel and get more food plus it would actually be good. The biscuits I received were also doughy in the middle ugh. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Cute breakfast/brunch spot with a nice, open atmosphere.  I came here around 8am, and there wasn't really a wait, we we got seated quickly.  I had seen some reviews and pictures of a Lobster Egg Benedict, so I was really excited to try that dish. But when I got there, they didn't have that as an option. :( I ended up getting the Cali Benny (I'm a Cali girl, I had to!), which came with avocado and tomato. It was very fresh and yummy, and a good alternative to what I was originally craving. It also came with some breakfast potatoes, which were also good.  Service was great - everyone was super friendly!"}
{"text":"SLOW KITCHEN!   We've been coming here for years and the past two times, it has taken about 40 minutes to get our food after ordering."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with a friend yesterday. It was packed but the wait was short. The food came pretty quickly and was still fresh and hot. Really good avocado omelet.  The wait staff checked us a few times including the manager - all good. They use a tablet to take your order - great. Love the tech however we waited longer to pay than to be seated. Use those tablets to check people out.   Edit this was intended for Fort Mill location."}
{"text":"This was one of the best breakfasts we've had out in months. Omelets, country benedict, blueberry pancakes, sausage and gravy, everything was prefect.  Very kid friendly as well."}
{"text":"What a fine breakfast destination. They also serve lunch and, but I love the breakfast. I've been looking for the perfect little breakfast spot and Toast is definitely high on the list. It's very cute and quiet. Wonderful if you can go when it's not crowded. They have indoor and outdoor seating. I got a little corner all to myself where the windows open to the outside. They serve breakfast all day so I got the \"combo\". The flapjacks...my friends, they were amazing!!!! The combo comes with one flapjack or french toast with eggs and bacon. They have a variety of stuffed french toast and flapjacks. I decided on the banana nut flapjack with scrambled eggs + cheddar and turkey bacon. The best \"flapjack\" ever! Big pieces of fresh banana and crunchy pecans. It was big enough to cover the center of the plate but not huge. Just enough to make me full. Perfect breakfast for under $10!"}
{"text":"4 stars for food 3 stars for service and the inability to make gluten free toast. 4 attempts for toast ( I know) the last two they just brought back the original third attempt but flipped it over.  That was the last star.   35 minute wait on Sunday.   No longer my go to spot. This is the second time they were sloppy in food prep."}
{"text":"Sub-par at best. We had the Eggs Benedict and the hash and neither were impressive, in fact both were very bland.  We also had to wait for 20 minutes to get a table. This place is not worth what they are charging for the food or the service."}
{"text":"Second time around. After much debate went with my husband this morning. Much better experience and much better food. We will be back."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. Service and food just ok. Still looking for that great breakfast place in North Carolina and yet to find."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  The food is very delicious!  My family and I have been here several times and everything is always perfect!  Breakfast and lunch items are equally scrumptious!  Fresh high quality ingredients.  Highly recommended!  We will return again and again!"}
{"text":"Choices are plentiful, service is great, prices are good and the food is delicious... Looking forward to returning and trying more dishes!"}
{"text":"My mom and I had breakfast here yesterday.  I must say it is very pricey.  We both had biscuits and gravy, a side of grits and she had one egg. I had water and she has a tea. No meat mind you.  It was 19.00 after tax.  The food was good but they were a little selfish with the gravy.  Our waitress was kinda rude.  This is located in Indian Land SC, not Ballantyne..... could have gone a mile down the road and enjoyed a huge breakfast for less plus a cup of coffee.  Too pricey for us. Won't go back to this location or Tega Cay."}
{"text":"Food is good here but the French toast has too much cinnamon in it. Get the pancake instead. Don't expect an amazing breakfast like the flying biscuit, but eh...she'll do. Service is kinda slow."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place!! I have been here three times this week. The food is fast and amazing. The entire staff basically waits on you so you can stop anyone for anything you need. The atmosphere is very clean and industrial like. I guess I am a regular here now."}
{"text":"Definitely the worst location I've been to. Ordered apple cinnamon pancakes to go. No apples. Order a large orange juice and was given a small. And she tried to debate me on it because it's the corporate location. Just admit you were wrong. Go to the concord or university location."}
{"text":"A pretty standard brunch place, though somewhat pricy. I got the \"blah-blah-blah\" omelette and it was tasty, though it hardly blew my socks off. The eggs were somewhat soggy though the ingredients seemed fresh. My gripe with the price began when I was served my \"pesto pasta salad\", which was ~3-4 $ and yet came in a very, very small ramekin. That's a somewhat ridiculous price tag. Finally, the service was so-so. The hostess sat us as soon as she could and gave an accurate time estimate of when we would be seated when we first arrived. Upon sitting, however, we were greeted with an over-zealous waiter who asked us what we wanted to drink before we had even seen a menu. We were literally only beginning to pull out our chairs when we were accosted with this question. This was a small thing but I would appreciate some patience. Finally, she [our waitress] took too long to check on our meal and didn't bring out the plates. TLDR: this was not a bad experience per-se, but mediocre such that I am not eager to return."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today.  Now I understand why there is has been a line out the door since it opened.  Cool atmosphere and a wide variety of breakfast/lunch foods to choose from.  I went with the BLT Benedict and absolutely love it.  My wife got the spinach and mushroom quiche and couldn't get enough.  I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"The service is excellent, very friendly and with happy dispositions. I've been there five times and had great service every time and tasty food in a matter of minutes. There's no wait time since every waiter is your waiter!"}
{"text":"Before you even bother to read any further -- go to La Patisserie in Mooresville instead (although there is also one down the street) -- that place is way better.  We didn't even stay long enough to eat at Toast Cafe due to the awful customer service.  My friends and I came for brunch on a Saturday and were quoted a 25 minute wait for a table.  We asked if we could sit at the bar and wait and the hostess said that was not a problem.  So we sat there and we all ordered a cup of coffee while we waited (by the way, AWFUL coffee).  Then she kept asking us how long we were going to be until she finally just told us to move so that she could seat people at the bar.  We explained that we were told we could wait at the bar and she said that the information we had been told was incorrect.  We talked to the manager who really didn't do anything either besides apologize so we decided to leave.   We went to La Patisserie in Mooresville instead and had a wonderful experience!  Way better food options and fantastic customer service!"}
{"text":"Delicious & Great service!! The lobster omelet & French toast was awesome & rumoisa was sooooo goood...Rum, orange juice & Champaign!! Great place for brunch."}
{"text":"Service is amazing. Lavazza coffee is one of the best decisions they came up with! Good breakfast and great coffee! That is what I judge a good brunch place on. Wish the Bloody Mary mix was more consistent but I can live without."}
{"text":"Food was good it was a beautiful day so we sat outside. French toast they use nutmeg so if you don't like that you should know. Long wait at 10 am on a Saturday it's a popular place so plan accordingly. Friendly staff, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I've been twice. First was pretty good.  This time a disaster. I was there at noon on a Sunday Poached eggs were gelatinous. Way not cooked. Grits were actually grit soup.  One thin slice of cold white toast for $2.50. Service was distracted at best, absent at worst. The line to pay your check literally went to the front door.  Worst $25 breakfast I've ever had (no liquor).Theory; so busy nothing gets done well.  Don't take a chance on ruining your day."}
{"text":"Food isn't as good as I thought, great and friendly staff although food was bland. Not as good as I thought it would be. I haven't had an omelet from there, which they have a huge variety of. I will give it another try just for an omelet. Hope for better food."}
{"text":"Toast is pretty good. Im not a huge breakast fan, but my husband is so we come here alot. There is always a wait on weekends, but it actually moves pretty quick. The staff is great and they have a lot of food options. We always get the eggs Benedict or the california benedict. My only complaint is that I wish they had a larger variety of coffee. They dont have a barista or the option to get Lattes or things like that. just plain coffee. For a breakfast place, I was really hoping to have some coffee options and flavors since I dont like just plain coffee."}
{"text":"We decided to go check this place out on a Sunday morning and got there around 9:00 a.m.  There was not a wait, but by the time we left, there was a line out the door.  Service was quick, but I'm not sure how I like the random servers flocking to tables once someone needs to order, refill, etc.  It is almost too much.  Kevin ordered the quiche special - cheese, broccoli, bacon, and tomatoes.  It was good, but we both felt we have had better.  The broccoli was flavorful though, I did like that.  I ordered the apple cinnamon flapjacks.  They were okay, the flavor was kind of bland.  I still liked the sweet flavor the pancakes had, but I was really expecting a big kick with apples and cinnamon.  Unfortunately it was not there for either flavor, it was just a small hint.  I also thought there might be chunks of apples in the pancakes, but they failed on that part.  Don't just do a flavoring Toast Café, actually have apples in the pancakes!  I will say, it makes it to three stars because they have an excellent value.  It was a lot of food, in fact neither of us finished.  I didn't even come close, I think one pancake with one sausage would have been enough, but instead there were three large pancakes with two sausages.    I'm not sure we will be back as we would prefer to go to Terrace Café, but it is an option low on the list for breakfast."}
{"text":"I've been to the Toastery many times and it's always delicious! The wait can be bad for bigger parties but I usually go around 11am on Sunday mornings with my boyfriend and we've never waited more than 25 minutes. It's delicious, filling and affordable so it's become our go-to breakfast spot!! My favorite is the Cali Benny and his is Huevos Rancheros."}
{"text":"There is one thing that you need for good food. This location did not have it. Flavor.   It's absolutely hard to create a dish without flavor. I'm disappointed. Greatly. The hollandaise sauce tasted like air! Not coming back."}
{"text":"Lured by a half-off entree coupon in a Val-pak mailing (don't judge!), we set out for an early Sunday meal.  It was probably about 9 AM, so we were pre-crazy brunch rush.  We were seated immediately.  The place has a clean modern-cozy feeling going on, reminding me of some of the Eggstasy restaurants back in Chicagoland.   My food was a hit.  I got the crab benedict with hash browns.  Their hash browns were delicious, soft and slightly garlicky, and I never knew how well crabcakes and hollandaise went together... it's gotta be the splash of lemon juice.  Mind you, the hash browns are cubed and soft (more like \"home fries\") and not fried shoe string (a la IHOP).  I think this is an important distinction given I know people loyal to both camps.  The only slacker was the coffee, which tasted like it might have been sitting on the burner a bit too long. If I recall correctly hubs got the boring breakfast (he almost always does), toast, eggs, potatoes, meat, juice.  He was satisfied if not blown away.  Also he's in the shoestring hash camp.  Well, my food was good enough that I'd come back.  Although I'm starting to wonder where I can get a knockout cup of decaf with brunch..."}
{"text":"We Love coming here on Sunday's, great customer service and the food is amazing, you all have an awesome waiting team because everyone always checks to see if we need anything 5 stars to them, however the lady at the register isn't very nice, we have had 2 bad experience with her, I'm not sure if she is overwhelmed or doesn't care, we love coming here, but she needs some training, I am a GM in the customer service field and the attitude we get is very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Egg-cellent breakfast But yeah it is killer food. My girlfriend loved the corn beef hash My breakfast burrito was bangin"}
{"text":"Great food and they have several locations. The staff is always helpful with suggestions of new things to try. My favorite breakfast place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I ate there roast beef sandwich and I enjoyed it and I savored the flavor. It was eligant and delicious and I recommend getting the sandwich."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and so far so good. I chose this place for breakfast because they have gluten free french toast, which was delightful by the way. They have a fun drink menu full of all types of mimosas and liquory coffees. I'll be back for the mimosas alone. The servers are fun and very helpful. Plan to come early as the wait can be a little long."}
{"text":"Had brunch two weeks running at Toast ... definitely the place to go for brunch in town.  I had lobster rolls and the most delicious little cucumber salad ... wonderful despite the $$.  Have also tried their full breakfast - fried eggs, bacon, hash browns with a blueberry pancake (flapjack) on the side - wonderful batter, chock full of blueberries.  Delicious orange juice and mimosas.  Super friendly, helpful service - puppies allowed on the rear patio.  Lovely walk through Davidson College grounds to work off the calories afterwards."}
{"text":"The service is super unorganized. No one seems to be assigned a section. The food is nothing special. I had eggs Benedict with hash. The hash was more like cubed potatoes and they were over salted. My friend ordered the omelet with lobster and bacon but they left out the lobster. So the cook than comes out with the lobster meat on a plate so he could add it on top. Overall I'm just unimpressed with the experience and food here."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to Toast. I went with a party of 5 on Sunday around 10am and I had no issues finding parking this time. In addition, we only waited a few minutes before we were seated. This differs from my last experience when I arrived at 11pm. Parking was more difficult to find and I had to circle around once before I lucked into someone pulling out. That time we waited around 30-45 minutes. However, if you like games, there is a cornhole board outside available to pass the time while you wait.   Once seated, we received our drinks and our server was friendly. Toast adopts the philosophy that every server is your server so don't be afraid to ask anyone when you need something. We were missing syrup and another server was able to help us immediately. I ordered The Combo which included an egg of your choice, sausage or bacon, French toast or pancake, and an orange slice. I ended up choosing a scrambled egg, sausage, and French toast. My favorite part was definitely the French toast that was topped with powdered sugar. I would recommend this plate as it was a good amount of food for $10.99.   Overall I had a good experience at Toast and will probably be back in the future."}
{"text":"Just ate breakfast here on Veterans Day, and it was pretty slow, so I think we lucked out since I've seen some long lines here on other days.  I was surprised to find that it's pretty big inside. I imagined it to be a little hole in the wall, but it's actually a huge place with inside and outside seating.  Not particularly interesting visually speaking, but you don't come to a place like this for the looks.  As for the food, I went a little over the top with my selection.  They were having a special of Lobster Eggs Benedict, with I think Canadian Bacon underneath.  It was fantastic.  The lobster was fresh and savory, and the ham's saltiness complimented it well. It came with their version of hash browns which were really home fries. They were also really nicely done, with a lot of flavor, although what exactly they had in them I couldn't say, just that they were great. I did have a bit of my buddies pancakes, and they were a solid choice too, but I'm pretty sure he was jealous of my huevos.  The service was quick and friendly too, and as others have commented, they do a team style service, which makes things faster, but I also think it takes away any chance you have of developing a friendliness with your server.  No complaints though, and I'll be back I'm sure for another visit to see what else they've got on the specials menu."}
{"text":"My brother and his family live in Lake Wylie and we come her a lot when I come to visit for brunch. I've been at least a half a dozen times. I only took off a star because the service is hit or miss. More misses than hits but the food quality makes up for it. Lobster omelette has large chunks of lobster meat, simply delicious. I've had a variety of the French toast, pancakes and salad wraps, all were great, yummy and super fresh. Food quality is always good just the service staff doesn't seem well trained in using the iPads, which are a recent addition and for another example, my sister ordered a Lobster omelette and they gave her a southwest omelette. The waitress never came and apologized but another member of the staff corrected the concern. There might be a wait during busy times but the food is worth the Wait.  Enjoy just bring your patience. Signed with Disappointment and Calories, The Original Charlestonian #LEWReviews   Update: I took off another star as after speaking with the company. They quote stated that they are \"sorry that I feel that service wasn't exceptional\". Further justifying that service is their priority. Ummm well unfortunately it wasn't on the several occasions that I've been and will be encouraging my family to not go again. It is clear by their clear disregard of my bad experiences, repeat...I've been and gotten poor service on multiple occasions, they aren't focused on customer service."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious!   It's not just a breakfast place, they also serve lunch! Both, delectable!!!!   · Tomato Bisque- Delicious!!! They gave me a sample and turned out to be a whole cup! Incredible!!!   LUNCH..  · Mac-N-Cheese - Incredible! They should call it Creamy Cheese Penne pasta. It was fabulous!!!   · Mashed Potatoes- very good, but strange! Red potatoes creamy, yet chunks of potato.   BREAKFAST..  · French Toast- Very good, it had a hint of cinnamon.   · Fruit- Honeydew melon, blueberries, pineapple, & cantaloupe. - Very good!!"}
{"text":"Toast finally came back to Huntersville in a beautiful new location, and I couldn't have been more disappointed with our experience.  We visit the Davidson location somewhat often, and it felt like two completely different restaurants. There was no cornbread with apple marmalade, something I always look forward to snacking on while deciding what to order.  I ordered the combo meal: flapjack, eggs, bacon. My husband ordered a burrito. The servers were friendly, no complaints about customer service, but the food was mediocre, and quite subpar for the pricing. My pancake was bland and had flour chunks in it, I could only stomach a few bites. The eggs were incredibly greasy and bland. Toastery claims to be serving fresh ingredients, but these eggs certainly did not taste farm fresh. The bacon was overcooked, and definitely did not taste the same as the bacon served at the Davidson Toast.  My husband thought the burrito was just fine, but his hash browns tasted like they had been cooked a few hours prior to being served, they were a bit rubbery and stale.   Our favorite breakfast spot continues to be the Sunday brunch served at Fork. They are hands down better than everyone else in LKN, including the new Toastery. Which is disappointing, since we live just down the road from this new H'ville Toast location."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place every since I saw it in South Carolina. Now that it has opened only three miles from me, I decided to take a girls day with my daughters to try it out.  Ooooh, my goodness! We have found a new place to go for breakfast! I'm so sold on the Apple cinnamon pancakes! They had real apple pieces in them. They were absolutely dreamy. I'm warning you only once, not to get the potatoes. No, no, no, or you'll get addicted. I'm so serious. We could not stop eating these.   My girls had the create your own omelette and peanut butter banana French toast. They both love their dishes. One of my daughter refuse to leave her potatoes behind and asked for a take out container. She's addicted!  One thing I found unique about this place is they offer pineapple juice. My daughters both enjoyed the choices of juice.   I'm completely over satisfied with the service and food. The establishment has a very quaint and conversational setting. Whether alone or with friends you'll truly feel welcome. The staff will make sure of that."}
{"text":"Had a great brunch here last Sunday ! Service (our server) was a little off, but other servers were happy to help us. My son had the waffles and they were delicious, with grits that were creamy and yum! I had an omelet, The Runner, good taste and healthy like I wanted. We will have brunch here again !"}
{"text":"Ate here twice while we were in Charlotte. Enjoyed it both times. The Raspberry Walnut flapjacks was the best thing I ate."}
{"text":"New favorite place to eat brunch.  Food is always fresh, served quickly with a great wait staff.   Only suggestion add a Lunch special.. Half club and a soup should be added to menu."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  Moved down here from NJ, and it's hard to find a good place for breakfast when you're used to a diner on every corner.  The Toastery is the closest place we've found to a diner.  It even passed the test when our family came down to visit from NJ.  The pancakes are phenomenal!  The eggs and bacon are always done to perfection.  I've had better home fries (breakfast potatoes, whatever you want to call em) but that's not even a factor when everything else is so good.  I like the team effort of the wait staff as well, making sure you always get a coffee refill if you're in need, regardless if you can find your waiter or not, because all the waiters are your waiter: You will never be a waiter at the Toastery!  And you certainly won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Amazzzzing meal!! We came from out of town and found it on Yelp...We went for breakfast. I had bacon, sausage gravy, Best sausage gravy Ive ever had! My husband had the Maine lobster eggs Benedict and loved it!! Cute atmosphere and friendly fun staff! Go!! No regrets!"}
{"text":"We arrived before 8am to get a table of 8 for Father's Day.  Wonderful food!  They were fully staffed for the holiday."}
{"text":"While I'm happy to have another restaurant choice off of Concord Mills Blvd, the food this round was purely average. Famous Toastery has a fairly large menu, with a breakfast side and a lunch side, any of which can be ordered anytime. Breakfast options included omelettes, eggs Benedict variations, French toast and flapjacks, while lunch options consisted mainly of sandwiches, burgers and salads.   We tried the EGG WHITE WRAP with Brie, tomatoes and avocado. There was absolutely no flavor and the whole thing was very mushy, lacking any textural variance. The house made salsa on the side was very tasty and the only thing that saved this dish. The TURKEY REUBEN was exactly what we anticipated. The turkey was dry, but the rye bread was beautifully grilled. HASH BROWNS are not shreds, but rather are more like home fries.  With the addition of salt, pepper and hot sauce, these were pretty tasty.   I really wanted French toast, but when asked if it was good, a waitress told me she thought the flapjacks were better. Not a ringing endorsement, which is why I didn't try them. The service model is that \"everyone is your server,\" which can often go badly but it worked for us today. The service was good with our drinks staying filled and never needing anything.  The prices are too high for what you're getting. I'll pay these prices at Toast, Flipside Cafe or Terrace, but here I felt like I could do everything better at home. The omelettes and salads were $11-12, with a $2 upcharge for egg whites. Sides were $3+. Overall, I'm glad to have another breakfast/brunch option, but honestly the food is better and prices are cheaper down the road at Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"I normally love this place and I go to this exact location every time my mom comes in town. Today the bald guy with the beard who was serving us was so rude. He acted as if he was doing us a service by serving us. I don't know if he was having a bad day and was snappy with us because of personal problems but it completely turned me off. I know every server is your server but he completely ignored us while helping other tables around us. My mom had to get out of her seat to get help from other servers and this really put a bad taste in my mouth. If you can't be friendly with customers don't work in customer service"}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant with good food, great waiters and convenient location. I had lunch there today and enjoyed one of the luncheon specials.  I would recommend this restaurant for breakfast or lunch.  I have not had dinner there yet."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here on a Saturday morning, maybe right after 10 am. We braced ourselves for a long wait because we heard previously that was something to expect, but we were seated promptly and greeted by multiple members of staff.   As soon as we were seated our drink orders were taken allowing just enough time for us to look over the menu before our drinks came back, my wife opted for the Mimosa which was on sale for only $5 that morning (maybe a weekend thing), I had a sip and it was great, not too tart or too much orange.    For food, I ordered that mornings special which was a delicious combo of Nutella, French toast I believe, as well as eggs, bacon and sausage.   All around great vibe, cool staff, and great food. I look forward to us going back... Soon."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. Service is fantastic. The spot is super cute and small. With older rustic finishes   It feels like everyone working is your server. One persons sits you. Another gets your drink order. A different person refills your drinks. Someone else brings your food. All the while everyone stops and checks that you're having a good experience.   The wait can get long during breakfast. That's weekday or weekend. So plan to come with time to wait."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Food was delicious. We had a breakfast sandwich and corn beef hash with mimosas and a peach Bellini. Where to start -- their hollandaise sauce alone is worth the trip. It's creamy and delicious. The breakfast sandwich is made to order and I highly recommend English muffin with fried egg, cheddar and bacon. DELICIOUS.  They work as a team serving you so your drinks are always full and plates are cleared and check is given at a quickly manner.  The manager stopped by our table to make sure everything was great  GREAT customer service and even better food! So happy this location is here!!"}
{"text":"The strawberry French toast was great! I love the way they provide service by having all waitresses serve you. Makes the dinning experience pleasant."}
{"text":"Greek Omelette which consisted of spinach, tomata and feta was well cooked but I felt it was little bland when it comes to flavor.Hot chocolate was also okay."}
{"text":"Had a nice long dinner here recently and was pleased with both food and service.  The food was excellent, with generous portions - more than enough for a take-home box for those of us with smaller appetites! Server was attentive and water glasses kept full. We stayed until closing, which I know can be touchy for some places, but Toast staff were pleasant and accommodating right up until they locked the door behind us (No joke. We were THOSE people).  Can't wait to get back!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure try those hash potatoes  they are too addictive they also have fresh squeezed orange juice that taste so pure and good"}
{"text":"OK BREAKFAST. Had breakfast here once and it was average. Coffee was good and sting but the breakfast reminded me of Crackle Barrel's breakfast."}
{"text":"Another great experience at Toast!    Upon entering, we were immediately greeted by the restaurant owner Brian and offered to take a seat wherever we wanted (menus are already on the tables).   The parking lot was full, but Toast luckily has plenty of great seating.    This time around, I tried the Cali Benny (even though I was craving the delicious meaty Crabcake Benedict again).  There was a LOT of perfectly ripe chunky avocado on it, which was a tasty treat.  The accompanying homefries are delicious, too.  They're cooked just perfectly with the right amount of seasoning, and not too greasy.  They tasted even better with the soft egg yolk that oozed out of my benedict!  Yum!  Our servers were fantastic and attentive (again).  My (big) coffee mug and water glass were never empty.  The owner stopped by to check on things at our table, too.  Everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"Loud. Busy. And cold corn bread are the most memorable mentions. The cornbread  is served to everyone. It's a great idea, but just warm it a little. And that Sunrise Breakfast Burrito... Well, it was made by a caucasian. It lacked Mexican taste altogether. My server was extremely well mannered and kind which was a nice reprieve from the stressful loudness."}
{"text":"Today was both my first visit to Famous Toastery and my first time out with a group of YELP Elites, and a wonderful time was had on all fronts. Sitting down we had our drink orders taken and were presented with the second best cornbread I've had from a restaurant as a pre-breakfast treat. My meal order was for the oatmeal pancakes with a side of turkey sausage. These were hands down some of the best pancakes I've ever had. Soft, lightly sweet, fluffy. I love pancakes so believe me when I say these are worth a try. The turkey sausage, despite also being deliciously seasoned, was the low point of the meal as it was cold. You could tell they had probably plated the sides before the main course was off the griddle. Perhaps it was because of the large group we had but that doesn't excuse it. There was also some minor confusion with splitting the bill as Famous Toastery uses a group based \"every server is your server\" system, but all in all it was a pleasant experience. Would certainly visit again."}
{"text":"I was worried about this place due to the other reviews, but I'm glad we tried it out for ourselves.   We were seated basically immediately. I love that they've changed the inside of the place. It has a cool vibe, though it seemed like it can get a little loud.  I got the Western Omelette and added tomatoes. It was really good. I liked the hash browns a lot (home fries, really). And they have cinnamon raisin toast which is the best thing everrrrr. My husband got a burger. He liked it and they have wavy chips, another favorite.  If you're a big foodie, I don't know if you'll be thrilled? But for an overflowing omelette of goodies, it is a great spot!  And the service was great. Our waiter was really nice and our food came out quickly. No complaints.  Apparently experiences may vary, but I recommend taking a chance!"}
{"text":"This is a cute place to go eat breakfast and have a mimosa. I got the omelet which was very good and it came with a side of potatoes which I couldn't get enough of. Everyone working were very nice and helpful. Definitely found a new place to go eat."}
{"text":"Great view from outside patio. A few bees but nothing major. I had the avocado Benny. It was good not great. Service was decent but I guess no one wants to serve tables outside because of flies and bees but it is gorgeous out there. Everyone was pleased with their food. Was it the best I have had no. Would I go back and see if it is better inside, yes."}
{"text":"Toast is a lovely casual and good breakfast spot.  It is a pretty typical breakfast/brunch menu but there are tons of options and something for everyone. No matter what food mood I am in, I know that Toast will deliver. On top of that, my food is always great. I have had everything from the french toast, to pancakes, omelets, breakfast sandwiches, benedicts, and just simple a la carte items and I have never been unhappy with my meal. I wouldn't say its my favorite breakfast spot or that I ever crave it but I will never argue going there if thats where others would like to go.   The service is always quick and friendly but one thing that can sometimes be a bother is what day and time you go - I have waited an hour and I've also walked right in. The food is great though and its a very convenient location so its definitely worth a trip!"}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered the Club sandwich.  Everything was fresh and great tasting. The real potato salad with skins was excellent too. One of the best club sandwiches I've ever had."}
{"text":"Seriously an awesome Brunch place! While we had to wait ~40 minutes, there's enough around to see and shop.  Arriving at table - excellent cornbread and AMAZING coffee!   Drinks = good Bloody Mary and I had a really good drink (Rumosa) a mix of mango rum, OJ and champagne.  Nick had a salmon Benedict special that he said was amazed by and I had eggs and THE BEST CORNED BEEF HASH ON THE PLANET. (I'm Irish and have had plenty).  While just visiting, I would definitely come back if I'm here again."}
{"text":"Great service!  Strengths include the coffee, Apple and cinnamon pancakes and the bacon is to die for!"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast spot so far!  Staff is always friendly & helpful. Outside patio opened last time I was there and I felt like the staff was overwhelmed with the crowd but that just speaks to how good it is & how popular its become."}
{"text":"Nice place, and environment, went at 2 pm and although the staff was not busy they found a way to ignore me...  Ordered 3 scrambled eggs, 2 pancakes, 3 pieces of bacon, hash browns and coffee.  Only the coffee and eggs were serve able.  The pancakes were doughy and looked like they were made with waffle batter and sprinkles with sugar.  The bacon was literally sitting in it's cool greased fat.  The potatoes were not what I ordered and lacked flavor.   I rarely give bad reviews but you could not pay me to go back.  The breakfast was over $20 which is highway robbery for the quality of food."}
{"text":"From a gluten free perspective, this place is HEAVEN.  I had the bagel breakfast w gf toast (someday, gf bagels?!) and a gf blueberry pancake - delish!!! It's so easy to make us happy... fresh ok was good but warm. Service excellent. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food in general was good. I would have given it 5 stars except that they put damaged black avocado on my plate. When I asked to replace it with fresh avocado, the manager rolled his eyes at me. Anyplace that thinks they can give you damaged/ expired food is a red flag for me. I expect quality and if it's not up to par I expect an apology not an eye roll. After all, we are paying. It's not free."}
{"text":"Such a good place to have brunch.  The cornbread is amazing, and I like how the whole wait staff waits on you."}
{"text":"We tried out Toast Cafe today to see what all the talk was about and were not impressed! We were seated quickly and it is a great atmosphere but they were cleaning off a table next to us and knocked over a big glass of water that ended up spilling all over the back of my husbands legs! The person never apologized or even acknowledged it! The food was good but the waitress never came back to fill our coffee or see if we needed anything.  The cost was also way too high for breakfast especially because of the lack of service we received! If you want a great breakfast with great service go to Fort Mill Family Restaurant!"}
{"text":"The place has always been cramped and noisy, but I had dinner there often because the food was amazing. Sadly, Toast has taken a bit of a dive in food quality since they've expanded the business and changed the name to Famous Toastery. They took away the best items on the menu- No Tilapia Provençal, no ravioli, no chicken marsala. The online menu hasn't been updated yet, so I got very excited that they had changed the menu back, but then had my hopes dashed. Unfortunately I don't see myself stopping in nearly as often."}
{"text":"Had lunch there yesterday. Now one of new fav places ! The first time we went was 2 weeks ago and been back twice since then....."}
{"text":"The waiter helped me with healthy options on the menu! I was so happy to find that the healthy options were also very satisfying. I went on a Saturday mid morning I thought i was in a JCrew commercial this crowd is very posh and stylish. So i felt right at home =) Great place to enjoy  great food. The mimosa's are really good too!!!"}
{"text":"We ate there over the weekend. The service was excellent and the food was great. My daughter, who hates everything, loved it also. She had hash browns and wanted seconds. Both my husband and I had the Country Benedict and were very happy. The gravy has a buttery goodness that is amazing. Service there is outstanding. We have been here many times and in the past 3 months and we have never been disappointed"}
{"text":"Go here for solid traditional breakfast. They know how to do it right. Served on a plate. Appropriate portions. Great coffee and lots of refills."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Service is top notch and the from scratch food is heaven!  Best corned beef hash of my life"}
{"text":"I've heard from numerous people that this is the best brunch place ever.  So yesterday, I took my Mom out to brunch at your fine establishment for her birthday, & it was fantastic!  She had the crab quiche, & I had an avocado omelet.  We were not disappointed, as we felt that this place really lived up to the hype!  The food was fresh, & cooked to order, the service was quick & friendly, all in all a 5 star experience.  Will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Quick morning business breakfast before the day starts. Got the egg platter.   Good eggs and grits. Wheat toast was good also.  Great flavored coffee."}
{"text":"I will never eat at this racist, culturally insensitive restaurant again in my life. As a woman of color, I was subjected to demoralizing comments by a White patron on 12/21 and the managers did not diffuse the situation-instead they allowed this individual to \"jump\" into two of my friends faces which made us feel totally uncomfortable. Further this patron called my friends and I \"nigga\" on two separate occasions in front of management-never in my life have I or my friends been called a nigga. I'm totally upset and hurt by the situation. Additionally, the food is bland and not that good. #notaplaceforpeopleofcolor"}
{"text":"The service was amazing.  Greeted immediately even though we sat ourselves on the patio.  Order was repeated back to us the server made sure we had everything we needed and wanted for nothing.  The restaurant is so nice and very clean and most importantly the food came out timely hot and tasted delicious.  We just moved into the area and we will be back again and recommend it to our friends."}
{"text":"O. M. G. #Meatloaf. Probably not the first dish that would cross your mind at a place called, \"The Famous Toastery. Don't be fooled, though! It is THE best meatloaf I've ever had in any restaurant!  The accompanying mashed potatoes are made to order and they put a mildly flavored cheese in their's. It also comes with a roasted vegetable medley that's very complimentary.   This place is unique in that the waiter may change but the service is consistent.  It's very warm and casual and there's likely a wait at the usual rush hours, but very well worth it. By 10:00 am on a week day, you should be able to seat yourself, asap.   The menu has many options but I can't quit that meatloaf. One day, I'll branch out for a more brunch-like dish...  Right now, though, my only complaint is that they do not stay open 24/7!"}
{"text":"A little pricey for breakfast food, but I've never had a bad meal here. May be why I keep going back even though the prices are high."}
{"text":"I wanted to give these local guys 5 stars but it just wasn't quite there.  I loved the layout with the huge bar on the right wall.  Our service was on point.  And the food, the food was good, but not amazing.  With so many other good breakfast spots around Charlotte these days, it just didn't stand out from the rest.  Me and my cohort were in the area one afternoon trying to see if we could find out more info on the opening of Kindred's, a block or so away.  It looks like they're still a few weeks away.  Toast seemed like the obvious choice.  We walked into an extremely busy restaurant for what I considered to be after lunch hours.  After being promptly seated our server came shortly after.  As usual, I have to take forever to order, because it has to be the best.  Once I was told there 86'd the corned beef hash I got the avocado omelet as others had mentioned on here.  My counterpart ordered a benedict and a bloody mary.  Our food came out fast.  I liked the omelet, it just didn't seem to be anything special.  I would have preferred if the toppings would have been worked into it, instead of just being placed into a folded egg cake.  The had asked my date how she wanted her eggs cooked(on a benedict)?  As she was drinking a bloody mary at 2pm on a Tuesday, I answered for her with \"soft poached\", I kinda wonder what other options there were though.  Anyhow, it was perfectly poached.  The hollandaise was a little too citrusy for me though.  Almost like lemon juice extract or something.  A little zest would have been perfect.  We also tried to split a big ole flavored flapjack.  Some kind of berry and walnut.  Simple, but yet executed well.  I forgot to mention that the place was extremely hot.  Like uncomfortably so.  Maybe something was wrong with kitchen vents that day, I don't know.  But other than that no real complaints.  Good food that isn't too awful expensive and in a great location if you are a Davidson local or a college kid."}
{"text":"Good food.  Strawberry bellini was to die for.  Corn bread was cold and a bit hard.  All in all, I would go back again!"}
{"text":"We all came here for Sunday morning post-wedding brunch.  Considering we were a party of 7, we got seated relatively quickly (it helped that we were there before all the post-Easter mass people).  Coffee was acquired quickly:  we had injured among our ranks (it was a wedding, after all), so this was a great move on the part of our waitress.    After that, we ordered some food.  I have a low-grade addiction to goat cheese, so the Northwest omelet was an obvious choice.  Others got some of the good stuff on the menu, like the strawberry and cream cheese french toast, the crepes, and the crab benedict.  All the food came out really quickly, and was excellent.  My Northwest omelet was incredible:  so much cheese :D.  Also quite affordable.  The ambiance here is really nice:  rustic, with a nice outside area as well.    If you're in Davidson and want some brunch, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Food was amazing as always..only giving them 3 stars this particular visit because I had a hair in my food. I will probably give them another shot tho. I've enjoyed all other previous visits here!!"}
{"text":"This may be the hardest place to find using Waze, but once you do it is a great breakfast. Sit on the sun porch and enjoy the ducks on the pond. Maybe a little pricey, but the portions are good sized."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the fresh squeezed orange juice. The nice waitress offered us water and ice cubes to go coz of the hot weather. That was really nice. The breakfast menu is served all day. Brunch anytime? That's my kind of place."}
{"text":"If this place amazes you, you probably don't know how to scramble an egg.  Way over priced for a basic meal.  Tea is brown sugar water and food is very basic.  I dont mind paying a higher price but for Gods sake make it more appealing than waffle house."}
{"text":"Cool brunch spot for the weekends (do they actually do anything else like lunch or dinner? Hmmm). At least on the weekends, be prepared for a long wait and bad service. The staff looks as if it was almost a surprise that it's the weekend and may be busy. They are either understaffed or simply not trained and can't keep up. The food is good - good meaning solid, not exceptional. The guy dressed up like a piece of Toast dancing around sort of gives you a weird vibe, but hey if they need the business at least they are going at it on a creative angle. There are a lot of families/kids - the acoustics are not exactly a quiet place to grab some coffee. All that said, I'm a big fan of local restaurants and staying away from the chains. Give it a shot. If they can up the service game, there might be something here."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and have enjoyed everything we've tried. The food is fresh and well prepared.  The wait staff is fun and friendly.  Try the Rumosa drink if you can."}
{"text":"We love this place for breakfast.  We were a fan when they were in Huntersville, NC.  The restaurant is very friendly, attentive staff we cant say enough about this place.  We love the breakfast and i hear that they are now serving dinner, which is on our list to try.  Their specials are always different and if you have a favorite they will be happy to accommodate.  Our favorites are the Captain Crunch French Toast, PB & Banana French toast, anything Crepe and the eggs with potatoes."}
{"text":"Toast is a well regarded breakfast place in Davidson, though they have other locations throughout the city as well. I think it's overhyped for what it is. It's a normal breakfast place with average food. The atmosphere is what sets it apart, more so than the food. Service is nice and quick, which helps with the turnover. Try to come in early before the church crowd on Sunday's. We went around 9 am and didn't have a wait. However, I've been before where the wait was close to an hour. Fortunately, if you do have to wait, you can stand outside on the quaint Davidson downtown streets and enjoy coffee.   They do serve delicious cornbread as an appetizer with some sort of Apple marmalade. They have all of your typical breakfast offerings: egg sandwiches, omelets, pancakes, French toast, and a seasonal special menu. Coffee was just ok. Our food was served about 5 minutes after ordering, which is somewhat alarming. I got the Huevos rancheros off of the specials menu. It was just okay. They weren't served with flour tortillas and I prefer they served whole black beans rather than refried. The others at the table ordered breakfast sandwiches and they were just average, and didn't come with a side. The food was fine for what we were looking for as a casual/quick meal, but if you're looking for a more upscale brunch or more eclectic menu, I'd suggest Fork."}
{"text":"Food is great had the turkey burger with avacado. Strong mimosa, Only thing that was aggravating was tall glasses with short straws."}
{"text":"On a Wednesday morning with 26+ open tables the hostess wanted to seat us 2 feet from the kitchen door and within elbow touching range of other customers. I asked for a different table and then she copped an attitude. Service from there on was good food was good but over priced. Oh yeah- ironically no toast served with our breakfast."}
{"text":"I came here with Jennifer C. while on lunch one day because I am in love with breakfast. When she suggested it I looked at their menu and saw my favorite breakfast food biscuits and gravy.   One thing about me, I am a biscuits and gravy connoisseur. I have had them everywhere possible, and am on a mission to find the best biscuits and gravy around.   Since they only have it as a side I also ordered some bacon, thinking that it might be a small portion, like maybe only 1 biscuit. I was wrong, it was definitely 2 large biscuits. Plenty of food. The only problem was I didn't get my bacon. After 15 minutes the waiter came over and noticed, but by this point I had decided I didn't need the bacon. He asked if I wanted it, in which I said no, it was fine. He then said \"but I already charged you for it\". I gave him a look and he said reluctantly that he could take it off. Thanks?   The gravy wasn't my favorite. It was buttery or greasy, or something and brown. Not a big fan of brown gravy for breakfast foods. Brown gravy goes on dinner foods. (Did I mention I was raised in the South?)  I was also able to get a mimosa, a $5 special which was very good.   Overall, I would give them another go, just not the biscuits and gravy. Maybe stuffed french toast?"}
{"text":"I had the bacon cheeseburger. While it was definitely fresh, it wasn't for me. I'll give it three stars now but that could easily go to a four next time around if I like something else. The mimosa was refreshing"}
{"text":"Its just a chain place.  Staff was nice but the food was overpriced and not impressive.  All I had was eggs Benedict with avocado and it was so bland and plain that I wished I would have just eaten some scrambled eggs at home. I am a pretty decent cook, so when I go out to eat I expect food to be what it should be.  Maybe to the untrained pallet they think this food is great but diner food is even better than this. The coffee tasted stale as well.  Will probably not come back when Panera bread is right down the street.  Not sure what all the rave is?"}
{"text":"As I was traveling through North Carolina. My wife told me about this amassing place right off I-85 in Charolette where we could grab some brunch.  May I say it was worth the detour   At this restaurant your able to set yourself, which is  very awesome to me! We were able to set in the sunroom which faces the water.   They have a cool way of serving their guest by using a team serving style. Where everyone is your server.  They gave us complimentary cornbread! And your from the south you know you love some cornbread lol   The cornbread was sweet and moist. Just melts in your mouth but the apple butter they serve with it took the cake!   I order the Southwest Scrabbler and she ordered the Avocado Benedict. But came out looking very nice. The flavor in both dishes where amazing."}
{"text":"Good food with prices that could be lower, but nothing too outrageous. They serve breakfast into the afternoon which is great, but don't even think about trying to get a table on a weekend morning. You're looking at a wait of over an hour any week of the year."}
{"text":"Have family in Davidson and they were all excited that Toast was coming to Dilworth. Went in about 10:30 AM. Got a nice omelet, quick service, friendly and efficient wait staff. My only negative comments were of the ambiance. Seemed too dark and they had a tinny sounding stereo playing 60's music, too loudly.  Will wait a few weeks to go back and see if any changes made."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp and grits, and side salad, delicious. They split both plates to share with my girl, no extra charge. Will return"}
{"text":"Today I had lunch here for the second time.  I ordered the club with potato salad.  Honestly, the potato salad  was bland.  The sandwich was good but on the dry side.  I enjoyed my first meal here much better. (Half salad half wrap).  I'll give it another try & choose from the breakfast menu next time.  If they don't get it right then I'm done.  Oh...One more thing. It is a bit on the high side @ $15.00 for a club sandwich & sweet tea!"}
{"text":"Almost as nice as the others Here they ask those silly questions like \"first tie here?\" Slow on coffee refills  The waitress asked if we want coffee when we first sat down We said yes and we are ready to order She just walked away to get the coffee The toast in Blakeney is a well run machine I guess they need more time to train"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I haven't written a review on Toast yet! This is hands down my favorite brunch place in the Queen City. Nothing overly fancy or high priced, just consistently good food.   Starters: complimentary corn bread w/ house made apple butter compote. (only on weekends, I learned this the hard way).   Brunch plates:  1) My go to is always the crab cakes Benedict. I LOVE that they used the crab cake as the base for this and don't even bother trying to waste my daily carb intake with English muffins. Overally just a great taste & great portions. 2) Avocado Omelette - avocado, bacon, Parmesan & tomato. This thing (as well as all their other omelettes) is loaded with toppings. You just cannot go wrong with bacon + avocado. Home fries that accompany most breakfast dishes are heaven . 3) Toast's Famous Stuffed French Toast - go for the strawberries & cream cheese. Savory to the max, this Texas Toast won't let you down.   This place is not a hidden gem, so expect a wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"Have eaten at various locations and we couldn't wait for one in the University area. The place  looks nice especially  with the view of the water. I have never been and not gotten any cornbread upon being seated. Would have been nice, but didn't  bother to ask. Servers were not very attentive. Had to flag  them for more coffee,etc. Maybe today was an off day because  it wasn't  busy? Will probably  pass on this location over Ballentyne/Tega Cay locations."}
{"text":"Despite the decline in service, the food is still tasty. Sometimes the focus seems to execute like lightening and miss the  quality/forget to add/omit ingredients. We arrived right before 10 and there was no wait. Yay! I want to shout out Jack, who I observed cleaning  the high chairs. It is great for a worker to pay attention to the smaller/oft-ignored tasks.  :)"}
{"text":"An extension of the Dilworth restaurant, famous toastery is just as good!   We went here for breakfast around 9:30, and although it was busy, we were seated right away. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. Upon arriving you get excellent apple butter and corn bread.   I ordered the Greek omelette. Each omelet I've ordered here has been mediocre. Although they are fresh, they lack a bit of flavor and are fairly simple. The homefries have excellent flavor typically, but were slightly undercooked today.   Overall, it's definitely worth checking out for breakfast but I might avoid the omelets."}
{"text":"Ate the eggs benedict there for brunch on April 1st and they gave me Salmonella. There were at least 3 other cases at the urgent care I went to that got Salmonella from their eggs benedict that same weekend. When I called they said they must not have heated the raw egg in the hollandaise enough. It's bad enough that the food is always cold and bland but to get Salmonella from their negligence is too much. Be warned!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have always enjoyed the food and service. The waitstaff is friendly and accommodating ( we have a 12 month old ). The food is good with a wide selection of brunch foods. It's pretty basic brunch but always well done. Get here early because otherwise you are looking at a long wait."}
{"text":"We went on Saturday morning, table of 5. We waited maybe 8 minutes, amazing!  My kids were taking forever and I thought we would be waiting forever. Nicely done FT!   Our waitress was really nice and came right over to us. All the waitress and waiters stopped at our table to see how we were doing.   I ate the stuffed French toast, ohhhh man. So good! The toast was warm, soft and perfectly cooked. The cream cheese and strawberries were yummy too, there wasn't a lot of strawberries inside but man it was good.   The only negative (not so bad) was our check was wrong, we said something and it was fixed quickly."}
{"text":"Fresh breakfast food that was absolutely delicious. Ordered a mimosa, pancakes, and grits. Everything was super fresh and very yummy. The franchise owner was there and greeted us to ensure everything was a-ok. Servers were friendly and took orders with ipads. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"The food and service is declining and prices have risen significantly.  Breakfast was just okay.  We ate and paid. Tega Cay and Ballantyne locations have way better service and food, but this location is closest. Here's hoping the University one is here soon...."}
{"text":"Considering there is a serious lack of Mom and Pop breakfast places in this neck of the woods, Toast is a nice find. Everything is made from scratch, and the atmosphere is pretty cozy. That being said, nothing spectacular was served. I had the corned beef hash, which was not from a can but overwhelmingly salty. The hash itself and an egg would have been sufficient, but they drowned it in hollandaise sauce. I thought that sounded decadent, but it didn't translate well as the hash had been thoroughly killed with half a pint of salt.  It's an okay alternative to waffle house or ihop, but it's not worth the 30 minute wait I experienced for a table."}
{"text":"Love this brunch spot. So many great items to choose from and the service is always fast."}
{"text":"Excellent food, prepared quickly and accurately.  Very friendly staff.  All ingredients are fresh.  I've been there twice and I haven't been disappointed yet.  It's a wee bit cool, so if you get chilled easily bring a light jacket."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Toast today and it was pretty much what I hoped it would be, which was good.  It has a very quaint space and is a super cute little restaurant on N Main Street.  I had the vegetable wrap with a side fruit salad.  The wrap normally comes with a pasta salad but they were able to substitute with no prob (& no extra charge!).  My friend had the egg salad sandwich with the side pasta salad.  She had that before and really liked it so she ordered it again.  She also said the pasta salad is amazing (if I wasn't on my annoying diet I would've tried it!).  My vegetable wrap was incredibly good, I couldn't help but clean my plate!  The side fruit salad was mediocre.   Service could've been a little quicker (we waited probably 20 or more minutes for them to take our credit card) but otherwise the lunch was good and it was a great atmosphere.  Also cheap!  Our total was only $16 for two!  I'd like to go back for brunch and try some of the items on their brunch menu."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you want to spend a ton of money on crappy breakfast.  It really burns me up to see all of the great reviews here when I know they are only because it is a trendy place to eat.  I've been here 2 or 3 times and it has been slightly above average (at best).  Here is my most recent experience...  My french toast and scrambled eggs came out cold. I mean , it wasn't even warm.  The butter didn't melt one bit.  The cheese on the eggs had hardened.  Flying Biscuit, Terrace Cafe and Louis Grill all beat this place to death!"}
{"text":"Love these guys. Great food, great service! Fast, I'm always blown away by how fast my order comes out! Yeah the food is a little pricy for breakfast, but the ambiance and service makes up for it. A great place for Saturday morning breakfast with the family or even a early morning business meeting. Love it, check it out!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. Fresh eggs, excellent sausage, delicious breakfast potatoes, and fresh raisin toast. Coffee was fresh and not the typical low grade brew found at most places. Nice atmosphere with outdoor seating. Definitely going to be my new place for breakfast when visiting Concord."}
{"text":"Me and my wife was driving around and we happened to go down the road and saw this place and we stopped for breakfast. Went inside and was seated very quickly. Loved the menu and I liked how every server was the server. Food was great. I got the stuffed French toast with peanut butter and banana. I recommend people go to this place and try it."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a pretty large group of people. We were seated with no problem and drinks were given to us immediately. Our server was really nice and attentive to our needs so our cups didn't go empty for very long. He was also pretty great at giving us advice on what food to get.  I ended up ordering the Southwestern omelette with hash browns. First off, I love potatoes-- any kind, and these were just great. For 10.99 you really got your moneys worth, the omelette and servings in general were pretty generous. My omelette has chorizo, tomato, peppers, cheese and I added mushrooms. I felt that the way my omelette was cooked was to perfection. I really appreciated that and the fact that the cheese was cooked to the point where it was stringy when cutting into my omelette.   Also, we ordered drinks at the restaurant which were SO good. Overall, the place is a great place for breakfast/brunch/lunch. Staff is so nice and the food is great and very reasonably priced. I'm really grateful that I was introduced to this place because I am definitely planning on coming again."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on our way to DC. Food is GREAT! Staff members are very friendly and knowledge about the food. I had the \"New Yorker\", LAWD it's was sooooo good!! The potatoes are to die for lol... My husband had \"The Bernie\", he almost licked his plate clean lol. Freshly squeezed Orange Juice, very tasty.. YOU MUST get the Stuffed French Toast w/ cream cheese & strawberries. OH and Pokemon Go is VERY  popular around the lake by this restaurant. We sat on indoor patio to eat and we counting 12 people walking around the lake playing Pokémon  Lmao. But really you must stop here. They serve breakfast and dinner all day."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a quick bite to eat with my wife. As soon as we walked in we were immediately seated which was nice for how busy it was.  We met a few of the serves because they have a great system of ask whoever is closest for anything you may need and everyone was so friendly.  I ordered the plain hot dog and it was great. I found the bun it was on a little odd because it looked like a folded slice of bread, but when I looked underneath it wasn't folded. It was actually a hot dog bun! Very cool and hadn't seen one like it before.   Great place to stop in and have breakfast, lunch, or brunch!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the multiple servers thing is a new fad or just something that has been going on down here and those of us in NJ didn't know about. I like it. This place was nice. It sits off of WT Harris hidden behind the Hilton and along a small pond with a fountain and ducks. The food was good. It didn't knock my socks off, but it was good and the portions were adequate. You won't be rolling yourself out of there, but you will be satisfied. Again, I'd recommend it. I think I'll go back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"um, this place is great.  We waited on a friend to come and they were almost 30-45mins late but our server took care of us the whole time. The place closed at 2:30 that day and we ordered about 10minutes before closing and we still got great service.  I got the Romelette which had meatloaf and cheese and it was amazing! I didn't speak the whole time I was eating it was so good.  Also tried Bellini and Mimosas, not so great. Bellini was too think and sweet and Mimosa was also too thick. Must be the fresh juice?"}
{"text":"Food is always amazing. Their gravy is to die for, biscuits are tender. The French toast is heavenly. Everything I've had there has been A+. I'm from out of town but anytime I'm visiting Charlotte I make it a point to stop here more than once."}
{"text":"Service and food excellent. Best waffle I had in a long time, didn't even need to add syrup. Everything served exactly as ordered. Definitely worth the 20 min wait. Downtown Davidson perfect location."}
{"text":"Food A+ Service A+ Location A+ Prices A+ Atmosphere A+ Parking B+  I was first introduced to Famous Toastery when it was just \"Toast\" in Davidson. Breakfast is good any time of the day & I will gladly eat a huge breakfast & may or may not eat the rest of the day. I am sad to say I have never ate at their locations for any other reason except breakfast.  This trip, I had the \"build your own omelet\" with mushrooms, onions, sausage, & mozzarella cheese. My side was grits & toast.  Our waitress was fantastic. Very attentive and friendly. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to arrive. Everything was delicious.   Breakfast menu has something for everyone. I hate that I don't go here enough to try different items!  Prices are reasonable. Parking can be tricky.   I think my only complaint is that they did away with the shredded hash browns."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have deprived my tastebuds & tummy from visiting Toast!  My boyfriend & I made a point to head on over this morning though & an 8 AM opening time saw us, plus quite a few other couples, too.  This was a good sign!  They opened the door & allowed all of us to file in & choose our own table.  The cafe is a decent size, but mainly just tables seating two & four.  As soon as we sat down, we had a young waiter come over & ask for our drink choice.  A minute later, out came my coffee (in a huge mug - score!) & my boyfriend ordered apple juice, which came in a medium size plastic cup. They also brought out huge plastic cups of water. Another minute later, fresh, warm cornbread appeared at our table. YUM! I'm such a sucker for cornbread.  It was light, fluffy, & cooked perfectly.  About another minute, a young girl came & took our brunch/breakfast order.  I order the two eggs (scrambled), grits, white toast, & bacon.  My boyfriend ordered the stuffed french toast, with eggs, & bacon.  Within five minutes, we received our food. Presentation was top notch! Everything looked great on the plate.  Luckily, our food tasted as good as it looked!  The eggs were light & fluffy, the toast was toasted nicely, bacon is thick cut, with no fat & grease, & the grits weren't too thick or too runny. Shawn's meal was equally as good (he said); however, he wished the stuffed french toast had more strawberries & not so much cream cheese.  The wait staff came over quite frequently to check on us, refill my coffee, & make sure we didn't need anything else.  Other notes: looks like a typical cafe, has a \"homey\" feel to it, with wooden tables/chairs, greenery vines hanging around, local artwork on the walls (which are for sale). Wait staff is efficient & quick.  Cafe is clean.  Prices are reasonable, especially when you look at the food portions.  This will be a place I'll definitely frequent!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and just as described in the menu, great selection to choose from.  Service was pretty good, server forgot my toast but outside that's coffee stayed filled and the food was out quick.  Will definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my lunch at this nice little restaurant in downtown Davidson.  Great sandwich and service at a fair price. Waitress was courteous and food was served quickly and hot"}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday brunch to catch up with an old friend. The wait was a lot quicker than the hosts les us on to be, which is always great! The interior was very cozy and classy with the wood flooring and tables...reminded me of a similar brunch place in SoHo NY called Jane.  They started is off with a basket of their delicious corn bread...yum! I got their New Yorker which was one of their egg specialties (scrambled eggs, smoked salmon and onions) with hash browns and rye toast on the side. 'Twas quite satisfying and filling! Service was excellent as well...just remember to pay at the front on your way out. Would be a great place for an elegant brunch date!"}
{"text":"The shared service isn't  working properly due to inattentive servers and having to stop and  wave servers down to get service.   Manager who is more engaged in filling salt and pepper shakers with dirty tables around us. We also, had empty glasses had to find my own silverware and for refills had to go ask shared server for service.   Shared service isn't working the way that it's designed,. I think with shared service no one takes responsibility for that customer at the table.   Very slow getting food brought to the table no follow-up to see if additional service was needed. Ordered grits no, spoon or butter had to go to the counter to get these items. Reconsider shared server service very ineffective.  I had to wait once entering the restaurant only to figure 30 minutes after waiting they had 5 table dirty that no one cared to clean; we were on a false wait ---?   The food was good once we received our entrees. This restaurant could be better - servers don't seem that  compassionate or happy.  It's just hungry people looking for great food and \"service\"."}
{"text":"Well first of all the staff was so friendly and awesome that makes me want to come back. The setting is very nice too! We sat at the little table next to the fireplace.   But I got the blueberry flapjack and it came with one egg and three pieces of bacon... I don't exactly think it was worth 10.99. It was delicious but not worth the price. My boyfriend for the country Benedict and that was worth it. So I would definitely go back but I would get something different."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here!!! So amazing. Get the gravy. And the Greek omelette. And a mimosa. And all of it."}
{"text":"I have been here for Sunday brunch and it was super food, great service and a little pricey - certainly four plus stars. I went last Friday lunch with a large group that had reserved the patio for $20.00 pp lobster rolls. The lobster rolls had less than 2 oz of lobster meat per roll that resulted in a very expensive lettuce sandwich.   They, also, ran out despite have had a prepaid number of orders."}
{"text":"Again...and I feel like I say this a LOT about Charlotte restaurants...just one more place with two-star food for five-star prices.  The price for eating out in this town are crazy - and I'm from the NYC area, and I'm quite used to high prices.  I don't mind paying good money - but it should be for good food.  When EVERYTHING on the menu is $12 and up....I would expect to be rating my experience here with at least 4 stars.  I won't get into the details - suffice it to say, I've tried this place 3 times, and each time has been a 2-star experience.  One small detail I would like to give:  I ordered grits as the side that \"came with\" my breakfast.  The waiter asked me if I wanted plain or cheese, and I order cheese grits.  When the check came, I notice that they charged me .75 for the cheese for my grits.  What?  Yeah. Enough said.  Note to restaurant owners: if you have to nickel and dime your patrons like that, you don't deserve to stay in business."}
{"text":"In my experience, the best breakfast in the Charlotte area.  Let's review the checklist:  - A line stretching out front AND quick seating.  Check. - Cool ambiance with a diverse crowd.  Check. - Outdoor seating front and back. Check. - Killer food. Check.  I had eggs, hash browns, and biscuits - all to perfection.  Sampled French toast, bacon, and spinach quiche, all fantastic. - Bonus item - killer coffee.  Check.  All in all, a must stop for breakfast.  Other than some slightly inflated prices due to the Davidson pretentious factor, this is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch - never been there for a dinner. Wonderful atmosphere. Very comfortable. Food is fantastic and choices are enticing. I love coming here whenever I'm in town. I've never had a bad meal, or experience in general."}
{"text":"Good breakfast but nothing to rave about. Giving it 3 stars because it's pricey and breakfast should be a relatively inexpensive meal. Total was $32 for two people and we didn't even order a alcohol, and that doesn't include the tip. If it wasn't so pricy we would go back more often but my wallet can't afford those kinds of prices too often."}
{"text":"Please fix the Parking!  There are More tables than parking spots!  Staff was very friendly and this rapidly growing chain serves fresh home-cooked food!  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was amazing & large portions! Service was also fast! We did have to wait almost 2 hours for a table, but it was Mother's day so we expected that.  The mac n cheese was great, made with penne pasta & bread crumbs. I also enjoyed the turkey sausage because it wasn't greasy at all.  The quiche was different since it had green beans in it, but a very large piece! Potato salad could have used some salt. Aside from the long wait we were highly impressed with this place considering the busy holiday."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place doesn't have a higher rating. I've been coming to Toast since before I lived in Charlotte and have always had a great experience. Being one of my favorite brunch spots in the city, Toast serves up breakfast favorites with good prices and fantastic service.   Toast tends to be a popular spot on the weekends so be prepared to wait a little. However, they do serve up complementary coffee to help with the wait and we normally get seated fairly quickly. They run table service as a group and not an individual, which is actually really nice. Don't expect a 'tragedy of the commons' pitfall, but rather a well oiled machine that keeps your coffee cup from running low. My wife an I often like to split a main dish because 1) they are massive 2) there is no splitting fee and 3) they actually give a nice presentation. We did this on our most recent visit during snowmageddon '17 and it actually looked like they made 2 smaller omelets with a decent serving of sides. That makes room to get some of their delicious stuffed french toast!   Toast boasts a solid breakfast game and is a go-to for me with visitors or recommendations. Also don't miss out on their fresh orange juice maker (better known as a mimosa maker to me)."}
{"text":"Was looking for good place for brunch. This place is just what the doctors order!!! Great Eggs Benedict!!!! And also super affordable."}
{"text":"Service was average, the waitress was mediocre at best.  Mid meal our waiter was switched and the remainder of our meal experience was excellent. The stuffed French toast was delicious, and fresh fruit gave me the perfect balance...I will return!  ***P.S. if you're going to work at a restaurant the least you could do is familiarize yourself with the menu!"}
{"text":"I came, I saw, I toasted.   If you love breakfast food, then Toast is the spot to be. They do their breakfast and brunch menus right.   You want eggs? Sure, we can do them in 20 different ways, how would you like yours? You like pancakes? We like pancakes too and will gladly serve it to you in one of several flavors if you manage to make up your mind on which.   Come on an empty stomach because their job is to fill it.   Fun facts: They call their pancakes flapjacks. And their breakfast line on the weekdays is a mere pop in and sit down compared to their wrap-around-the-corner line for brunch on weekends.   Toast, I toast you for becoming my new favorite brunch spot in town."}
{"text":"Start with the freshly squeezed orange juice. The lobster eggs benedict were excellent with the perfect amount of dill added to the sauce. The grits were delicious and the coffee just right. All of the servers were friendly"}
{"text":"Amazing is the only word that comes to mind! My husband and I tried this restaurant  out for the first time yesterday and we were blown away! The customer service was amazing. From the moment we walked in we were greeted and were directed to sit anywhere in the dining room. The food was absolutely amazing! I had the quiche and potatoes and my husband had the egg breakfast! We will definitely be coming back!! Outstanding"}
{"text":"On a long road trip we stopped at Famous Toastery for breakfast. We ordered pancakes, eggs, omelettes, fruit, grits, bacon, hash browns, and French toast. It was all excellent! The service was fast and courteous. We will definitely eat here again while traveling on I-85."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Famous Toastery's other locations in Charlotte twice before and was satisfied but not impressed. This location? YOOOOO! They truly made my heart smile.  My waiter and server were both super attentive for the short time I was there.  I didn't stay long because I knew what I wanted when I was seated (huevos rancheros with extra tomatoes) and they brought it out in what seemed under five minutes. The waiter for the table over stopped by to check on me as well in a way that seemed genuinely interested in helping, if needed.   There was a guy next to me at another table who asked his waitress many, many, MANY questions about the menu options and the waitress was so patient and never appeared exasperated or rushed. Well done,  Famous Toastery. Well done!"}
{"text":"Showed up on a Sunday morning and was seated after a short wait. It took 20 minutes for our order to get taken and then  after several people around us who came in after us received their food we asked if we could get an update on our food. The waiter said \"it's Sunday morning and our food should be out in 5 minutes\".   After 10 more minutes and 50 minutes after we ordered we asked for the manager. The wait staff got very rude and said the manager was too busy cooking meals.  We decided to leave and on the way out tried to alert the hostess of the issue. The waiters came up and started arguing with us. We left. They need to staff appropriately and not argue with their clientele."}
{"text":"First of all this place seems to be the kind of place you would find in Myrtle Beach or Pigeon Forge ... and I mean this in the worst sort of way. We were there on a Saturday morning, looking for a nice place to eat breakfast. This was not it. We stood in line and were finally rushed over to a table that was squeezed between four other tables ... to be honest, I am surprised it meets fire code. This also means that you get bumped by everyone else being rushed out. And rushed you are. The food arrives so quickly, one wonders how they can cook it so quickly .... I guess they are fast with the microwave, great at thawing stuff, and cook as much as possible in advance. So, after waiting around for a while to sit, the server impatiently taps their foot waiting for you to quickly pick something from the menu. Hey, here is a tip: WHY don't you post the menu near the door so that people waiting to get in, can go ahead and make up their minds ... The food is about the same quality as Cracker Barrel, or Bob Evans .... definitely nothing to write home about. The big difference between Cracker / Bob and this place, is that the other two resturants are quieter, and you have more room to sit and to eat. Also, you are not given the bums rush after the food arrives. I mean, my plate was literally whisked away BEFORE I was finished eating. I would have been upset, but the food just was not that good, and so was not worth getting upset over."}
{"text":"I visited for the first time on my birthday, and again between classes one week. Both times the food tasted great but our waiter seemed to get lost after the food was served. I ordered the French Toast Sandwich and their take on hash browns both times..because they're just that good. The second I also ordered a mimosa, which was made with their in-house squeezed OJ (GREAT).   [The Sandwich]: French toast, egg (cooked your way), add bacon (thickcut), add cheese (your choice); Toast was sweetened perfectly and went well with the warm syrup. [The Potatoes]: Seasoned well! Taste great with ketchup. [The OJ]: Freshly squeezed. Perfect.  The aesthetic was nice-it put me in the mindset of a warm cabin on a winter day."}
{"text":"Our family came to visit us from SF. We took them to Toast for brunch. The food was very good but our waitress Hilary was rude from the start.  I don't understand how someone with that kind of attitude works in the food industry. When I asked her co-worker her name the first thing he asked was if she had been rude so this goes to show that she's like that all the time. She ruined our first visit to Toast needless to say that will be our last all because of Hilary. To the management, you should consider hiring a new waitress to take her place."}
{"text":"I dined at Famous Toastery for the first and last time recently.  I wanted to have breakfast out and was craving corn beef hash.  I ordered corn beef hash and asked for it to be brown on both sides, the server kept saying crispy and I corrected her twice.  The corn beef hash, which was served as shredded potatoes topped with corn beef, was not good.  There was so much grease that I had to blot it off.  The potatoes and meat were hard, I had to pick through it for the decent parts.  Thankfully I ordered scrambled eggs and English muffin because they were the best things I ate that morning.  I ordered orange juice that tasted like a cross between tangerines and something tangy.  My dining companion had an omelet with grits.  He thought meal was just okay, we both were not satisfied.    I gave three stars because the service was okay and the meal was served in a timely manner.  Also, the ambiance was drab but what made it okay was that we sat on the enclosed patio with ceiling fans on low."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with everything about Toast of Dilworth (TOD).  My experience at TOD yesterday was like putting on a pair of jeans you haven't worn in a while, reaching in the pockets and finding a $20 bill.  You don't know where it came from, how it got there or even how Long its been there.  But it doesn't matter, you accept it as good...  Went here Monday July 16th.  There was plenty of parking.  We did not have to wait at all for a table.  In fact we were able to choose any open table we wanted to sit at.  As I was trying to decide what to order, I was torn between ordering breakfast or lunch.  I think it says something positive about a restaurant when you look at the menu and there's five or six different items you want to order and they all sound delicious.  Well, this is exactly how I felt as I looked at TOD's menu.  I finally decided to order the grilled chicken wrap with roasted red peppers and mandarin oranges that was the Monday special (see pics).  My date ordered the Chicken Cesar Wrap.  She was torn between that and four or five other options as well.  I will say, it seemed like it took a while for our meals to arrive.  But once they were placed in front of us...WOW!  The grilled chicken wrap that I ordered was stunning (see pics).  Its difficult for me to explain exactly how the succulent grilled chicken, roasted red peppers and mandarin orange all came together, because I have NEVER experienced a taste sensation such as this.  The cold slaw was unique and unlike any other cold slaw I've had.  It tasted liked it was made two minutes before being served to me.  It was the perfect combination of fresh, crunchy, cold, and sweet.  My date's Cesar Wrap was not quite as tasty, nor quite as unique, but still above par.    The service was super.  They have a sign that reflects their service policy.  It reads, \"Every server is your server.\"  This was truly reflected in our lunch experience at TOD.  We were sat by one gentleman, drinks were served by different lady, food orders were taken by a different dude, and our meal was brought to us by yet a third guy.  Everyone we came in contact with was cool however.  No issues at all.  ...kinda like that $20 you found in your pocket...I don't know how or when Toast arrived on the scene and I really don't care.  This place is damn good, and just like that $20 I found in my pocket, I'm keeping it, and I'm not asking any other questions.    I AM A FAN OF TOAST!"}
{"text":"First time in Davidson NC.  Used Yelp to find this place. In for breakfast.  Older country/ecclectic decor.  Downtow.  Lady had corned beef hash.  Gentleman had quiche, nice hearty portion.  Food was OK.  Our pics provided. . This place uses team approach to service.  Quickly greeted and seated.  First server brought coffee, but my cup was only half full.  Lady's cup seemed watered down.  A different waitress asked if we were ready and took our orders.  Another person refilled coffees & creams.  Another brought food. Another re-refilled coffees.  2 others cleaned up. . Overall OK experience."}
{"text":"Start with the the good news, my breakfast burrito was made with fresh ingredients and was very tasty. The server(s) were friendly, knowledgeable and attentive keeping the coffee and water full. Unfortunately, a fellow diner was served  home fries swimming in grease! When asked for a separate dish to remove the fries from the grease she assisted with the rescue mission and added \"that's just not right\". What would have been right would be replace the breakfast. The place was empty and will stay that way if they continue to serve substandard quality food at the upper end of the pricing scale. I've visited a sister location and have found quality food with very high prices. No value here today!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time the other day and it is now my new favorite breakfast place! The staff was friendly, the location is gorgeous and the food was amazing!!! I had an omelette, hash browns, and a cup of coffee which were all so delicious. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A cute breakfast spot with the standard breakfast options.  The wait wasn't too bad - about 10 minutes. It was very cozy inside and there are lots of tables.   I wasn't overly impressed with the meal.  Eggs, hash browns (which are more like large breakfast potatoes) and turkey bacon. We also got one of the specials \"Holiday French Toast\" and it was way too sweet. My friend got the biscuits and gravy - and she said that was really good. I didn't try it, but it looked like way too much sauce for my taste.  I am saying A-OK because there was nothing wrong with it really. I just wasn't overwhelmed or impressed particularly.  I will probably try it again and see if I like something else better from the menu - maybe some bennys or a quiche.  I will update again next time."}
{"text":"We went to this place expecting a decent breakfast standard of eggs toast and some sides like grits or baked potatoes. Simple, sumptuous for the most important meal and near our house.   Alas, the food wasn't really as expected. The omelette I ordered was - sausage, bacon, ham which didn't have any flavor. Just the meat was wrapped in a pan fried egg. The eggs weren't fluffy - was rather flat.   The good thing here was their fresh orange juice which didn't have added sugars. So healthy. And hence a bit tangy - which I like.   There was a longer wait but we got our seats within 15 minutes. They give you coffee while you wait but it wasn't anything spectacular.   My friends had variants of veggie omelette which was even worse. No spice, nothing really great to come back to.   The toasts which they gave were not well done. Bread was okayish.   They do have a lake side seating which might be good but the food isn't worth the ambience."}
{"text":"The food was super tasty! Everything just tasted fresh. The place felt really rustic and the interior was pretty cool. The food came out pretty quick, but the service in general was pretty slow. Maybe because it was busy hour. Other than that, I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"First I will day the staff is very friendly. Thats the only reason for the three stars. The food is not very good. The burrito was bland. My wife got the corned beef and eggs. It was terrible. We didn't even make it 30 minutes and she was sick in the bathroom. For the money (its extremely overpriced) I would rather go to Original Pancake House or Sunrise for that matter. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Just eh. Nothing to call home about. Overpriced breakfast food. It wasn't bad nor was it amazing. I would rather roll the dice on not getting shot and go to a waffle house."}
{"text":"Horrible sub par food!  AND have nerve to be pricey.  Save your money and don't go here."}
{"text":"Have been here twice; once for breakfast and once for lunch. The food is just so-so. I ordered a quiche at breakfast and the crust was completely raw and inedible. They did remove it from my bill, but I would think that a place that specializes in breakfast would be capable of serving a good quiche."}
{"text":"Rating: 3.5/5.  The fresh $12.99 crab roll came with a small side of crisp cucumbers. The crab meat mixed with mayonnaise tasted slightly bland.  Moreover, the size portion was too small to be fulfilling.   The waiter made a mistake on the order of a crab roll. Initially, he brought a lobster roll. To be honest, I told him so.  The fresh-looking lobster meat was paired with iceberg lettuce. Nevertheless, the size portion of the lobster meat was small.  So, the ~ $17 lobster roll went back to the kitchen. And the ordered crab roll arrived afterwards.  The clean decor was relaxing and homey.  The bathroom was clean with no changing table. Their free wifi for customers wasn't working.  You can park easily on the street for free up to two hours from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m..  The food was fresh. But I would hesitate to come back here because of the size portion."}
{"text":"My go to place for breakfast and sometimes lunch after church. Some weekends I stop in on Saturday and Sunday."}
{"text":"Went back at the request of my girlfriend. Better experience, avoided the omelets this time and got the quiche, it was good. I'd be okay with going here once in a while. Still not sure why it's a favorite with a few of my friends."}
{"text":"Brought a friend from out of town here for breakfast on a Sunday and while it was busy, we were able to find a seat at the bar.  The food was excellent, I had the Avocado Omelette, and she had the Left Coast BLT (Being from CA she had to try it). We were both not disappointed.  The food was excellent, and the servers were all very nice.  Will definately be back again."}
{"text":"Went here for a solo casual breakfast on the recommendation from a couple at a local bar/restaurant last evening. Boy, we're they on target. I had a fantastic overlook of a scenic fall pond while dining. Servers were pleasant, attentive and efficient. I had some difficulty making selections as brunch and lunch items are available all day. I tore myself away from the Shrimp & grits to order the house special, 'avocado bennie' -a creative take on Eggs Benedict with a poached egg to order in a baked split avocado and topped with pepper cheese and a very lite dusting of Cajun spice. It was outstanding, though next time I'll ask for hollandaise instead of the cheese. I did substitute grits for the fresh fruit side. Can't be focused on healthy choices while traveling. Bottomless coffee and a glass of fresh squeezed OJ rounded out a perfect start to a beautiful day."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, but the five stars is because they barely fed my friend anything It was hilarious. And guess which meal was the most expensive? His. It was great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's fine food. It's a bit more upscale compared to most else in the area but it is overpriced and just eh."}
{"text":"I loved this place. First time visiting was a week and a half ago and I can't wait to go again.  Being gluten free, I was able to order gluten free pancakes, and the waiter made a note to keep it dairy free (because of my dairy allergy). I was also able to order the breakfast potatoes/hashbrowns, and the waiter also noted to keep those dairy free and gluten free.  The pancakes were soooo good. Probably the best gluten free pancakes I have ever had in my life. The potatoes were roasted red potatoes and they were delicious as well.  I saw that most people complained about the wait times, but if you go on the weekend, you should know you'll be waiting a while to get a table That's common sense. We went on a Friday morning and had no issues.  I love the fact that \"every server, is your server.\" So many people checked on us and made sure we had what we needed and were well taken care of. I seriously can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great food here. Wish you got more for the buck which is why I'm only giving 3 stars. Service staff is amazing and everyone is your waitress or waiter. Fast food service."}
{"text":"My son had his mind set on breakfast from this place after his hair cut after seeing someone else eating food from here.  I pulled up the menu on yelp and decided to call an order in since they always seem to be busy.  After a quick scan, we decided on the shrimp and grits and walked over to wait the 10-15 minutes we were told it would take.  As I expected, they had a wait and we were sent to the bar for pick up.  The wait for our take out wasn't too bad and we were heading out in no time.  The shrimp and grits are not a regular item and was a special that day, but in my opinion it was just ok.  I could look at the dish and could tell the grits were plain instant grits and for anyone that has enjoyed the real deal shrimp and grits in the low country knows the grits can make or break this meal and instant grits will break it every time.  All was not lost as the shrimp portion was pretty good but I will need them to correct this grit situation before I decide whether to return."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the mouth queuing cornbread with the Apple butter. Plates arrived fast and food was good and filling. There was some confusion about the order to seat guests as we were seated after a few other same size parties that arrived after us, no big deal."}
{"text":"This is an amazing spot for any breakfast lover! A must get are the potatoes as a side, they're very soft and have an amazing seasoning added to them. Anything you get here would be a good choice but I recommend the build you own omelet which is good in size no complains there, and the pastas and wrap from lunch time"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and tasty. We really enjoyed the service and the staff! My griddle combination was fresh and fantastic."}
{"text":"The culinary world is a beast and extracts a high price to those who work in the field. It is full of long hard thankless hours pressed into service cooking to the masses. As a cook, you feel very much like Charlton Heston in Ben Hur, rowing on a galley ship awaiting the slave-master's lash or death. It is a feeling I am oh so familiar with thus, I am sympathetic to the plight of the line cook. Anyone who has worked in the hospitality field knows that there are three NEVERS: 1) You never know when your guess will show up 2) You never know what they will order 3) You never know how much they will eat. Any good General Manger, Owner, Kitchen Manger, Chef or Line Cook will tell you that. These are some of the fundamentals which will help you plan for a successful dining experience and help you to have return customers.  I am glutton for punishment. There I admitted it; that is why I play the lottery hoping some day I will ensure my good fortune and never have to work again. I, however, am not a glutton for punishment when it comes to dining. This could either be from a hip new food truck to an old pedigreed established restaurant. If the food is poorly done I most likely won't be back. This bring us to my latest dining adventure. Being still new to Charlotte we have asked for tips on where to find good food and have found most everyone loves Toast Cafe http://www.toasthousecafe.com/.  This well loved family staple has been serving the Charlotte area for years. I am trying to understand why? Okay, I may be sounding like a soulless elitists from California picking on the the natives of Charlotte but, rest assured, friends this is not the case. My wife and I first tried Toast Cafe shortly after we first arrived here in Charlotte. We where pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and service from Toast Cafe. However on two other occasions our hopes have been dashed. Poor service and even poorer food was to be found in abundance when we took an out of town guess with us to Toast Cafe before the holidays on a busy Sunday morning.  Hoping that this was an \"off day\", we where willing to let things slide . Retuning today knowing on a slower day with fewer patrons amassing like a barbarian hordes we where sure that no mistakes would be possible. Right? Wrong!  How can you over cook toast and serve it cold with piping hot eggs and under cooked, cold hash browns? Or serve luke warm mushroom soup with an ice cold, semi-toasted meatloaf sandwich? This was after waiting 20 minutes for food that couldn't have had more than 8 minutes of prep on a slow day?  The General Manger did comp the meal so that was something I guess. Yes I maybe a glutton for punishment but, I am not stupid. Like Charlton Heston in Ben Hur, I will be watching the slave-master go down with his ship."}
{"text":"I usually see a line outside of Toast so my girlfriends and I decided to try it out one Saturday morning for brunch. We had a bit of a wait so we walked over to JT Posh for a little shopping followed by a few minutes drooling over the goodies in the cupcake shop. We were seated after about 30 min.   In summary, we were disappointed. The food was unremarkable, at best. My friend's french toast tasted as if it had been frozen & thawed (you know that chewy texture) and came with so much powdered sugar on top that she had to request an extra plate to shake some of it off. I ordered the avocado omelet and found it to be rather flavorless. I felt like I was eating air. My other friend left most of her food on her plate. Even the coffee left something to be desired!   The servers are nice (you will have multiple during your visit), however one order was not correct and no adjustment was made to the check. The prices are reasonable, probably more so than similar dining options in town.   With all of the great breakfast options in Charlotte, it is not likely that we will return to Toast."}
{"text":"Outstanding is the best way to describe this place.  The cornbread is soft and sweet plus the jellies are top shelf. I had the hash with 2 eggs and hollandaise sauce all over it. Gastronomical heaven. Prices are good and all the floor staff is your waiter so you can ask any for assistance not just your waiter. I hate when there are several waiters on the floor but yours is nowhere in site.  In the Concord, NC area this is my new breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I'm gluten Sensitive and I'm very thankful that they have gluten-free options. The pancake is fantastic and I also like the gluten-free bread. The service is always very friendly and fast. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. The price point is on the higher side but it is worth the extra cost."}
{"text":"Probably a 3.5 stars overall, but have bumped up to 4 because they do a good business for breakfast and lunch.  Strong service orientation where \"every staff member is your server\" so ordering and getting the check are easy and quick.  You can easily get in and out (plus driving time) during an hour lunch break which is key for the neighborhood.  Good selection of sandwiches, food made to order and they handle exceptions well.  All day breakfast (until 3pm) for those that love a pancake stack or omelette at midday.  The interior feels like a suburban chain (which it is) and doesn't offer a lot of character, but still good for an informal lunch or takeaway."}
{"text":"Thank you for a fast, efficient and friendly service. Our family were first time visitors on Saturday, the hostess Allison and Tim are courteous and attentive to our group. It is a definite!!' that we will return and word of mouth of the next best place to have brunch in Charlotte, NC"}
{"text":"Not my first time here but this time I decided to start my new year off right with a big ass omelet. I got the Boursin omelet. Now I love cheese, all kinds and Boursin is one of my faves to eat on crackers and with fruit. So when I came across this omelet on the menu, I had to try it and boy was it good. They put big heaps of the cheese in the omelet along with big pieces of crispy bacon and chopped tomatoes. I added onions and mushrooms, you know to start the new year off healthy. I got a side of \"hash browns\" which are just big chunks of potatoes. There's a $1.99 up charge if you want to add a pancake or French Toast. Btw if you add a side of French toast, you get 4 pieces. Overall great brunch to kick off the new year and cure a hangover!"}
{"text":"This place is great, the wait staff were very nice to us... it definitely felt like a family restaurant. The food was good; (especially the flapjacks.)"}
{"text":"This one star is for the food alone. Let me start by saying I have NEVER given a restaurant anything lower than three stars so you know this is pretty bad. I went to the restaurant today at lunch time I arrived at 1:20 pm I remember precisely bc I sent a text message as soon as I got there so I just went back to check the time. Anyway it was busy so there was a wait which I expected and didn't mind. I was greeted by the host and told there would be a twenty minute wait. The wait was actually thirty five but I was still ok with that. Finally when I'm seated SEVERAL waiters and waitresses walked by me saying nothing. This particular restaurant they don't have assigned tables I've been before anyone helps any table. Yet no one seemed to want to help me today. So finally I flagged a waiter down and ASKED him if he could help me. Now this part is very important I ordered my food and drinks at this time. I did this because they seemed to be busy and I already had to flag someone down to take my order I aid I better get it in while I have him. Ok so I talk to the guests with me, played on my phone, NOT ONCE was my drink refilled or my guests or were we even checked on. So after thirty minutes of waiting on my food I flagged down the saw gentlemen that took my order. I asked how long my food would be. He replied let me check and NEVER came back to my table. So I sit for another ten minutes and I notice the table beside me getting agitated as well. Finally I flagged down someone else who just so happen to be a manager her name was Merin. I informed her of how long I had waited and asked had he forgotten to put my order in. She said she would check on it. Did I mention this was a manager and my drink is now empty and she didn't offer me a refill either. Anyway she walks passed me three times saying NOTHING. Finally I ask her again we're up to forty minutes waiting on food now. She goes to the kitchen comes back and says the kitchen is backed up and apologizes. She asked if I needed anything while I wait and said they were cooking my food. After another ten minutes my food arrives the manager Merin brings it and I ask for my bill because at this point I just don't want to flag anyone down again when I'm done eating. She replies you don't have a bill I'm taking care of it. Here some advice to famous toastery in university city if I come to eat I don't want a free meal I want GOOD SERVICE and GOOD FOOD and REFILLS on my drink. I do like the food so I will visit other locations but a word of advice if you are hungry don't go here you will be starving by the time you actually eat!"}
{"text":"Come later on the weekends for a shorter wait. However if you do go in early, you may run into some famous people!   The brunch is great - these are the items that we always get!   Avocado Omelette  Hash browns - the flavor combination is fantastic!  Stuffed Toast with Strawberries & Cream"}
{"text":"Have given it 2 trys.  1st tried the spinach benedict, the 2nd tried the regular benedict.  Both times it was truely disgusting.  Not only did the sauce have no taste, but the eggs were disgusting.  Almost like they just broke a raw egg on top.  Is time tried the egg meddium and the whites were runnier than the yoke.  The 2nd time i got hard and the white was runnier than the first and the yoke was a little less runny.  But still totally tastless.  Gross place."}
{"text":"Our first visit will not be our last! The food is great the service is great and the founder Brian came and made our experience all the better. We will be back and we will be stopping in at their Myrtle beach, Jacksonville, Wilmington locations and all other 19  locations."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch this morning. GREAT service, food, and mimosas!!!! Definitely stop in if you are looking for a nice brunch spot. Had the huevos rancheros which was pretty good with a side of hash browns (seasoned red skinned potatoes).   If I'm ever back in the area I'll definitely stop in again..."}
{"text":"I've heard of toast a few times on the radio while driving to school in the morning and so today was the day I thought I'd try it out. It had a beautiful open concept restaurant and I had the New Yorker. It was delicious though I somewhat regret the fruit since its December. My only suggestion is a better coffee bean used because as a breakfast place I think coffee should be extra special. Good for brunch, the woman accross from me had a Bloody Mary that looked great. I wish I lived much closer because Id go here often. Try it out!"}
{"text":"There is a line out the door, and I can see why.  This was a very charming place.  This was our departing meal, and it was really good.  It was Parent's Weekend, and Toast Cafe was hopping that Sunday morning.  Still, this didn't stop staff from delivering fast service with a genuine smile.    As I said, the food was excellent.  I had a Club Sandwich, served with a tasty potato salad, which was everything I expected it to be.  I somehow can't remember what my friends had.  One of them had a wrap which looked really good.  I think the other order was one of the many eggs-benedict variations they had on the menu.  Maybe I'm just imagining that, as the benedict was a 2nd choice for me, and maybe I was just still craving that.    I later learned there are a small handful of Toast Cafes around the Carolinas.  I hope they're all as nice as this one.  I'll happily return here.  Holler if you're coming with."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb for breakfast.  Their shrimp and grits are divine.  I love that any server is your server and they keep your beverage filled up.  Anytime I am in Charlotte I try to hit one of these for breakfast.  They never disappoint.  My daughter did have the runner's omelet and was not impressed.  She is trying to eat healthier, but this lacked flavor.  Might want to skip that option.  I gave it a four because I think it is a little high priced for breakfast.  So the value isn't there."}
{"text":"Ate here today with a small group of Yelp Elites.  Undoubtedly, a tough crowd to please.  However, I thought our servers handled our orders well (nothing was wrong or sent back), and the food was on point.  My order of lightly scrambled eggs were as requested, and the hashbrowns were piled high,  too.  They missed the 5-star level with a clunky manner in how to split the tab individually among 7 diners, and we were never quite sure who was our server.  That being said, we were well cared for, the food was good, and the prices reasonable.  I say 'Give 'em a whirl.\""}
{"text":"I truly like this place.. I can alway count on them to be fast and on point.. Not that much different from Toast in Dilworth and the Toast on Rea Rd.  Except this one is never as packed. I always order their French toast, fresh fruits, and an extra order of their potatoes. Yes them potatoes are awesome. The maple syrup alway come warm. So this is why I alway look forward to dining here for brunch any chance I get!"}
{"text":"You should rethink all servers for all locations. We were left to her lonesome for over 30 minutes outside   Food was outstanding The hall in service was not. I am really sunburned. Thanks."}
{"text":"A GREAT little place - I was surprised to learn that it's a chain! This is probably only the second place I can recall that serves organic ketchup on the table - thank you!  I had the \"New Yorker\" - scrambled eggs with lox, onion and smoked salmon but I wanted to add tomato and capers to it to make it really seem like a \"bagel and lox breakfast,\" sans bagel, and they were more than happy to do it. For what it's worth, I recommend this as an addition to the menu!   My wife had the Boursin omelette because  she loves that sort of cheese and it was very good with tomato & crumbled bacon in it as well.   They serve cornbread with some sort of homemade chunky applesauce which is really great to spread on the cornbread."}
{"text":"Breakfast and service was good. It's hard to find a good breakfast that isn't greasy and blah but this place does a good job."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Toast in Davidson is considered our special occasion place for breakfast. The new huntersville location is 2 min from my house so we figured why not check it out . We were a party of 6 and 4/6 of us were at least disappointed in some part of or all of our dishes. This has never happened at the Davidson location, not ever. Here is the lowdown:  - waited forever to get our order taken. We had to ask a manager to be waited on.   - uncharming environment compared to Davidson location. It feels like a chain restaurant which is what it really is now.  - 3 of us ordered the corn beef hash and clearly the chef didn't sample his or her own work today because it was like eating a salt lick. Now obviously corn beef itself is salty but they must have salted (heavily) the dish or potatoes which totally ruined it. Terrible.  - the huevos rancheros were totally not prepared like huevos rancheros which are served on top of a smokey salsa. The salsa is the essence of this traditional Mexican breakfast. No salsa just some cut up tomatoes. Also, the tortillas were so over fried and cut up they were like French fries. Terrible.  - now on the positive, they know how to cook an egg as ordered. Delicious.  - the bacon was also cooked perfectly. Delicious.  - I tried a bite of the kids pancakes and they were also very good. Light and fluffy and served with real maple syrup. Delicious.   Overall, we really should have sent 4 of our meals back. But we didn't because sending food back just sets a bad tone at the table and this was our special Easter weekend breakfast out so we didn't.   Service - Server bordered rude after we had to ask a manager for someone to take our order.   I can't imagine for $84 for 6 (5 adults 1 child) we will be going back to this location. I really at this price almost expect a perfect breakfast all around."}
{"text":"I've tried the shrimp and grits and an omelet.  I found them to be texturallyl on point while also tasting fantastic.    The place's interior is dated and could use a removal of cobwebs.  This location needs some bathroom work.  I prefer the Concord location.  The price point is inline with the food offerings."}
{"text":"I literately just finished my breakfast and was debating on 2 or 3 stars. Wish I could give 2 1/2 stars.  I think 2 1/2 starts may represent a to go order best. Why?   I decided to add spinach and onions to my Northwestern omelet. First of all there was like a glob of goat cheese on the side, in the middle of the omelet. It wasn't melted like it should have been. There was A TON of spinach in the beginning of me eating the omelet. I didn't detect any other cheese, which there should have been (what kind I can't remember). My omelet was also dry as desert, but that's technically not their fault because I suspect many people like it that way. I like my omelet a little juicy. The inside should have been a gooey center of goat and some other cheese mixed up with sautéed onions and spinach, spread evenly throughout. Extra points for an herb goat cheese.  The hash browns were meh. I think they just placed a slice of cheese on top. It should have been a mixture of gooey cheese and potatoes with maybe a little sautéed onions mixed in.   The toast had no butter or anything to wet it up. I assume there's butter on tables when you eat in the restaurant. There should have been some packs of butter. Now I have some in the house but what if I were staying in a hotel or eating this on the go? What would have been good is maybe some honey butter. They should think about that for to go and sit down orders.   My slice of orange tho. That was on point! It was juicy and slightly cooled. Sad when the best part of brekky is a slice of orange. My dudes meal was aight. We both agreed tho.... Not worth $27.  Next time I'll put an order in Cafe A la Tieren..."}
{"text":"Overall this is a very cute place to eat. The food is great and the staff will ensure your needs are met. Any server can serve and take your order which keeps everything running so quickly."}
{"text":"We have been to Toast multiple times and enjoy every time!!  We've tried omelets to french toast to the specials.  All Delish!!  Service is outstanding - there's always someone coming around to fill up your coffee cup.  It's definitely always full but not too bad of wait."}
{"text":"It's been a year since my last confession and I got nothing but praise.  I've dined here on several occasions and each time is always the same: quality, promptness, variety, and value.  Since I'm a big fan of breakfast, this is how I prefer to start my day: Happy.  Famous Toastery adds to my joy."}
{"text":"Food, service, and atmosphere was good. I would go back. My 2 stars comes from the coffee that spilled on my hand from the outside staton resulting in 2nd degree burns and blisters all over two of my fingers. They provide tiny cups with no lids and my coffee was spilled when someone bumped into me. I reached out to the owners via Andy, the manager, and have still received no response. I want nothing other than to inform the ownership of this issue. Had this been spilled on my 11 month old, an elderly person, or perhaps more than just a few tbsp worth of coffee had burnt me it would have been way worse than it was."}
{"text":"The hollandaise sause had a funky sour taste, the country ham was so salty and thin, I think I ordered ham jerky instead. To top it off, coffee was so black and bad that it took 4 creamers to make it change color."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure eating here! Service is always amazing and the food never disappoints. Always fulfills my random cravings(which are typically hard being pescatarian) I had the lobster scramble with potatoes and was in loveee the scenery is great when sitting in the sunroom..i will always approve"}
{"text":"Staff and service was incredible. We were checked on at least 10 times. Food came out quickly after ordering and the coffee was strong. We had breakfast. Our only issue was that some of the meats were on the salty side. I highly recommend the avocado omelet (you can substitute chorizo for the bacon if you want to spice it up, I did, it was great).  Tuesday morning at 8am, no wait, quick service, kid friendly, we would definitely return."}
{"text":"My wife and I always enjoy or weekend trips here. As odd as it seems my favorite thing from this restaurant may be the drinks. The orange juice is fresh squeezed and the coffee is great. My only problem with our visits is that the place is too popular. If you don't get here early enough you are gonna have a pretty good wait."}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp when I was looking for a good breakfast place while traveling for work. I went during the week with a co-worker. Nice atmosphere inside, clean, on the water so there's a great view. When we came in there was only 3 other tables seated so we had our pick of where to sit.   Service: They have a different philosophy here, everyone is your server, not just one person which sounded great at first. One girl took our drink order and it took about 5min for another girl to bring them. We placed our orders and noticed there were about 6 servers standing around just watching us...awkward! Our food came and as we were eating and trying to discuss work we were stopped by 5 different servers coming by to see how it was...I don't mind someone checking in, that's their job and what should happen. However, they should have communication between them instead of every couple minutes someone interrupting. Then when we were done and our plates had been cleared it was like a ghost town! All 6 servers ha disappeared we had a credit card on the table ready to go with the bill and couldn't find anyone on the floor to ring us up for about 20min. This system seems very flawed to me as compared to having 1 person being attentive to a table that knows what's going on.   Food: The food was pretty good and in decent portion sizes. My co-worker got strawberry stuffed french toast and she liked it. I got a Greek egg white omelet which was pretty good...a little watery. The coffee was terrible so I'd do hot tea if available next time.   I would try them again but will look for another local place to call home when I'm in that area due to the service being so awkward."}
{"text":"Me and my guys' favorite place for breakfast! Shout out to Ryan for always providing great service. See ya soon!"}
{"text":"I don't even remember for how long I've been wanting to go to this place. This past Sunday it finally happened. It was around 1:30 when my husband and I got there, the restaurant was packed and there was a wait. The hostess advised that the wait time was around 25 minutes, which by us was fine considering a Sunday afternoon. Their menu is not that big, but they have some interesting options. Funny thing is their prices normally go from 10.99 to 12.99 It took me forever to decide what I wanted, because being very honest I couldn't find anything I REALLY wanted so I went with an omelet, Texas toast and a bowl of fruit as a side. My husband got the stuffed blueberry French toast  which I almost did too, but I would choose the strawberry one. When the food came I got a little bit disappointed, I couldn't believe I was paying relatively high for some so so omelet. My husband got disappointed with his French toast too. Overall the staff was nice, the place was clean, the wait wasn't that bad, however in my opinion it is not worth it. But please if you want to go to this place do not let my review change your mind. I personally won't be back, but I have friends that love this place. So I guess you will have to go and find out yourself!"}
{"text":"Great ham and potato hash with eggs and hollandaise sauce.  Yummy. Service was attentive and the coffee was delish."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast or brunch meetings. The French toast is great. The pancakes are great. The bacon is great. The ice they use in the drinks are great. You will be pleased with the fact that they team serve your table verses having just one servers. The atmosphere is great and I personally enjoy the screened in patio with fireplace. The only thing that keeps it from a 5 star rating is the price. It's not cheap."}
{"text":"Food was OK (had breakfast...none of our dishes were anything to write home about).  Food alone would have garnered 3 stars.  Issue with our visit was that staff seemed more interested in turning our table than our dining experience.  Met a friend of my wife's who she has not seen in 10 years & felt like we were getting the bum's rush from the minute we sat down."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the atmosphere was great. They bring a basket of cornbread and delicious apple butter for you to eat while you wait on your meal.  We had the avocado omelette and it was wonderful."}
{"text":"Poor service and poor food (though the fresh orange juice was quite good.)  All their servers are your server, which means no one is your server.  I waited so long after getting my OJ for someone to come by that I relocated to the bar.  Then, to top it all off, the omelet I received was cold.  Maybe they were having a bad day. It happens. But the cold food and the vacuous nature of the staff make me think this is their norm."}
{"text":"For a place that promotes that every server is your server, the service was poor. Ordered mimosas when we ordered our food. Had to ask two different servers to get them and they still didn't arrive until after we finished our meal. Food was pretty good. The eggs Benedict was delicious, as were the breakfast potatoes.  My husband ordered a special French toast which was, as he called it, disappointing.  We've been to another location and will probably go back to that one."}
{"text":"We stop in for breakfast from time to time and generally it's pretty good. Today however it was disappointing. I ordered my usual \"Country Benedict\" and decaf coffee. The waiter also offered the usual cornbread and apple butter. The coffee was cold and we had to hunt down the waiter to fix it. The cornbread never came but breakfast came along shortly. The biscuits were old and leathery as if they'd been steamed and microwaved. The ham was over salted under cooked and tough. The potatoes were cold. The sausage gravy and eggs were OK though. I wasn't able to catch a waiter for a coffee refill, but did catch one to finally get the cornbread that was promised earlier."}
{"text":"Stopped by for Sunday brunch on a nice day so it was pretty packed. We had a group of 7 so a 45 minute wait was probably reasonable. They make the wait as painless as possible with corn hole and free coffee samples outside.  Had a $5 mimosa which was tasty but I wish they used pulp free oj. Everyone was happy with their meals. The bacon cheeseburger got a thumbs up from a friend and two of us has the pb and banana stuffed french toast. It was definitely yummy just wish there was less pb and more banana. Felt like a dog with peanut butter stuck to the roof of my mouth!  Everyone was happy with the hash browns n coffee. The service was great, too, as whomever was near asked if they could get us anything.  Prices were fair. Restaurant was cute. Food was good. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great service.   Went on a Sunday morning just before church crowd was busier than expected but food was extremely quick. Would highly recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Took my Mother there for lunch today. While she enjoyed her turkey sandwich, I was some what disappointed with my Rubin. The corned beef was tough. I think if it was sliced thinner it would be okay. The sour kraut was scarce. Don't know if they were running low or what, but it was weak at best. I'll give them another chance in a month or two. But I think I'll go with something else."}
{"text":"I heard great reviews of Toast in Davidson and was intrigued to find out for myself. I went up to Davidson in a car full of my co-workers with the intent to spend a working brunch at Toast. All of them ordered breakfast and I ordered the half portobello with a cup of soup.   The service was pretty good. The food was, A-OK. The breakfast was nothing spectacular (especially for the price)...your average eggs, meat selection, and a single piece of french toast. The soup was hearty and rich and the sandwich was fine.   Watch your step though...the floors were so slick! I thought it was just me in my rubber rain boots, but everyone else was sliding around too. They may have put in new flooring since my visit was a few weeks ago and one of the co-owners said that was in the works. He was really friendly.  The ambiance was cozy and it definitely has a prime location in Davidson. It gets packed, so call in a reservation or get there early. I wouldn't make a special trip to eat here again, but it made for a nice road trip with my co-workers."}
{"text":"For a new restaurant, they didn't make a good impression. I purchased the Groupon and decided to try it for lunch. A month earlier I tried their Davidson location and thought it was pretty good so I was eager to see how the Dilworth location would be.   The service lacked care or curiosity. My husband and I went during a non-prime time and clearly the employees were cleaning up and restocking. Placing our order was uneventful and once we got our order the attention was gone. I had an issue with my side. It was roasted veggies, but it was clear they were overcooked and mainly red onions. I waited for a while to see if our server would return to check on us, but finally had to ask the person cleaning the tables if I could get something else. He signaled our waiter, got another side dish, and when our server brought it to our table, he just said is this what you wanted? Nothing about checking in on our experience, \"I'm sorry, was there something wrong with the veggies?...hope this will be better...\" The tomatoes on my sandwich were not good...you know when they are mealy, mushy, and flavorless (take it off the menu when it's not the season or make sure you import good ones). However, the avocado was fresh and very good.  I will give kudos for the manager strolling through asking tables how things were going. He just didn't pass by when things started to feel neglectful.   I could see Toast being a neighborhood food stop, but they missed the opportunity to build a relationship. Perhaps Toast is going for a hands-off approach, but it didn't work for us."}
{"text":"Been here a lot. Used to go to the Davidson location and always had great service. Here in Dilworth we've had several mix ups and plates that take longer to come out than everyone else's. They also don't know how to cook an egg over easy. The whites are always undone. Just very inconsistent experiences."}
{"text":"Third time eating at the Belmont location, fourth time overall and each experience has been as good as the previous ones. I believe that a really exceptional dining experience should be a balance between high quality well prepared food and great service...and The Famous Toastery completely delivers. I've tried something different each time (unusual for me - typically I stick to what I know is good) and each time have been impressed by how fresh and perfectly prepared everything has been. Go and try it for yourself, I can't imagine you would be unhappy that you did."}
{"text":"This is our go-to breakfast spot! The waiters share responsibilities so you're always being checked on and refilled w coffee if needed! Quick service. Very kid-friendly...we take our daughter there all the time who is under a year old. It will start to get crowded after 9/9:30 on weekends, so go early if possible. Favorites: Cali Benny, SEC on biscuit."}
{"text":"It was ok.  Had the cinnamon raisin French toast & a standard 3 egg breakfast.  Standard breakfast fare."}
{"text":"Before you read further, take the following into consideration. When I visited Toast, it was a famously busy Sunday morning. It was gloomy out and had been raining a few days prior. That said, if you are looking for a fancier country breakfast, this is a great place to start your day. The menu provided enough variety for a family and boasts a certain flair compared to some other local joints.  However, the prices are a bit high. More of a \"brunch\" than breakfast. For a large family, stick to IHOP or Cracker Barrel. The seating arrangement is tricky for parties larger than 4, maybe 5.  On a busy day, like my first Sunday attempt, the staff was a little slack. I'll give them the gloomy outdoor atmosphere but to make tips, at least smile and fill a water. I visited with my boyfriend at the time and he always told me I was too critical of servers. So, I try now to be more understanding. However, the visit does stick out enough that I prefer other restaurants but won't chime in if Toast is the suggestion among friends.  My mom has quite enjoyed her visits for lunch and if she Yelped, many she would have better insight to share and would prove I'm a bit picky."}
{"text":"The French toast was stuffed with preserves and not real raspberries. Not as good as I thought it would be. Begal sandwich was dry and tasteless. Boring food."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday morning with my other half around 9am. We parked on the street and had no difficulty finding a spot close to the restaurant. We were greeted and seated immediately. The place was very busy. Decent size and decorated with what seems like local artists' paintings. Fun, laid back atmosphere. Outdoor seating is available. They have a complimentary coffee station outside for waiting customers. Love that.  We had 2-3 different servers wait on us. All were friendly and helpful. We tried the following:  Almond milk cappuccino Almond milk latte Cornbread with apple butter Avocado Benny Breakfast Quinoa bowl Side of fruit Side of breakfast potatoes Side of french toast   The espresso drinks were tiny, but strong. We were hoping for flavored syrups to go in the drinks, but they didn't have any. One of the servers brought us complimentary cornbread with apple butter shortly after we ordered drinks. I like my cornbread on the sweeter side and theirs was just that. The apple butter complimented it. My avocado benny came with a whole avocado cut in half and each half was topped with an egg cooked over medium, Pepperjack cheese, and cajun spices. It also came with pico de gallo and fresh fruit on the side. It was delicious, light, but filling. I don't normally eat half an avocado let alone a whole one, so I gave the other half to my other half, which he added to his quinoa bowl. The french toast came with 2 slices of bread, cut in half. It was good, but had a strong cinnamon taste. It wasn't overwhelming, but I like my french toast to have just a touch of cinnamon. I thought the breakfast potatoes were cooked perfectly, a bit crispy. After finishing my side of fruit, avocado benny, half of the french toast, and a few bites of the potatoes, I was stuffed. I did not get a chance to try my SO's quinoa bowl. He ate all of it, though so that's a good sign. Our total came to $43.79.  When we left, the waiting area was full of people waiting to be called. Good portions, great service, and reasonable prices. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with 2 other people and we all got different food. Everything was great. Definitely going to be back in the future."}
{"text":"Stopped at this place after a productive morning at J Majors Bridal boutique next door. The place was nice and clean. Service was prompt. They are reasonably priced and have a great selection. Me being from NY expected some good southern brunch kinda cooking. And it was real good."}
{"text":"A much needed and welcome addition to the University area. It's a bit of a food desert around here and a spot where its possible to order healthy and good food fast make Famous Toastery a main stay for sure.  I showed up with 13 ladies from my office. I called ahead, and while they don't accept reservations they assured me they would be able to accommodate us quickly for lunch.  After a few tables were pushed together and our food came out lightning fast for a group of our size. The multiple server model worked on this day, maybe because they weren't too busy.  Portions were enough for lunch with a few of us even opting to take home leftovers.  Our group loved that you can order breakfast all day and with ingredients like quinoa you can feel good about your meal choice. If you want, their french toast looked worth the splurge too."}
{"text":"Apparently the food by itself isn't sufficient to decide 'Yay! I'm a fan' or 'A-OK'.  The whole experience matters!  For the whole experience its 3 stars and for the food its 4 stars, heck 5 stars for the damn delicious Mimosa with fresh squeezed orange juice. We only made it the second time we tried going to this place, first time we gave up looking at the line waiting to get a table.  In fact the second time we got seated because we were okay with patio seating.  Weekend morning are crazy busy and the wait time should be crazier I believe. As with any popular, crazy busy restaurant the waiters took their sweet time to attend us at our table and we finally got our water and mimosas came right after few minutes.  One sip and that's it, I had this fresh new perspective of the restaurant LOL. So we ordered our food, I was going with a French toast (Challah bread cinnamon) and wifie is a huge egg benedict fan and she orders that with house potatoes.  Loved my French toast with turkey bacon (not a big fan of turkey bacon is what I realized) but the challah bread was so tasty and had a nice bite.  The French toast wasn't overly sweet unlike some places I have tried before and I loved that mild sweet taste. The egg benedict was looking good and tasted even better,  Eggs were poached perfectly like my wife wanted and those house potatoes, WOW!! All this while I did not realize we were supposed to get complimentary corn bread and butter and only came to know of it when someone asked for it.  Our waiters did not even care to mention about that when she got our orders.  Couldn't hold myself asking to my waitress about it and she replied \"sorry we were out of corn bread today\"  which is obvious but the point was why wasn't we were told about it.  I understand during busy times the hospitality factor goes down a bit, but isn't that what makes it or breaks it ?!"}
{"text":"Expensive for no reason, one pancake one egg & 2 frozen sausages turkey patties made us very unhappy with our order. I had to end up scrambling two more eggs for us lol I mean seriously $10+ for that totalling 30+ for two no additives. Smh 3 stars to be nice since I was happy enough with the French toast."}
{"text":"I love this spot for breakfast and it's location. I wish they stayed in Huntersville. Get here as early as you can because it does get cramped and crowded (even in sh*tty weather) and the wait will be long. I dig their french toast and hash browns (but they're more like home fries) and love the fact they offer gluten-free now. I also recommend their Cali Benny, esp if you're a vegetarian, but still as yummy if you're not! Staff is friendly and pretty quick on getting the orders out."}
{"text":"Excellent service along with great food.  Good portions and the prices are reasonable.  Going back again"}
{"text":"Had no problem with the food or service. It was the manager who made it his mission to come over and tell me that it's illegal to feed my service dog. Some food may have fallen on the ground that my dog may have eaten. But I won't be going back there again. There are other toasteries in the area who are glad to take my $100 I spent on breakfast. Let me know when that ass is gone and I may return."}
{"text":"I've been to the Dilworth Toast location but the Davidson location is a step up.   I visited this Toast for dinner and was handed the type of menu where there are seven or eight items you want to order.   The service at Toast was warm and friendly  without being overbearing.   Toast is more than just toast. Their dinner menu ranged from premium burgers, daily risotto, pastas and favorites like shepherds pie.   I split a small poached pear salad (which wasn't all that small) and tried the risotto and lasagna.   Their prices were very reasonable for the homemade taste. Dinner here was worth going out on a cold and rainy night."}
{"text":"We have visited the Rae Road location regularly and are thrilled to have a Toast in Indian Land.  The manager and her husband are owners/operators of the Tega Cay location so know the franchise and how to operate an outstanding restaurant.    A rare and well-deserved five-star rating...which I am pretty stingy at awarding.  Why?  There is plenty of room.  Lots of table and servers to service them.  \"Every server is  your server\" is true.  Refilling beverages, checking in on diners, policing trash from tables and busing tables.  A team effort in all respects.  And for a new location it all works extremely well.  I think the key is that the manager manages by walking around and talking with the diners.  She is on top of everything.  Excellent!  The menu is an excellent offering of breakfast and lunch/brunch items.  And substitutions are a regular part of service.  Some of the more unusual items that are normal for Toast are lobster rolls (extremely yummy and great quantity of fresh lobster), meatloaf (sandwiches or an individual baked portion loaf), roasted vegetables (including cabbage which makes this dish and the veggies are not over-coked) and cheeses like brie, Gruyere, Swiss are always there to put in wraps, sandwiches and omelets.    You will toil to make your choices as there are lots of great options tempting you.  Beverages are not just refilled, but replaced fresh.  Nice.  And they give a 10% discount to Sun City residents and there are more offered, so ask about a discount.    A great experience all round."}
{"text":"Ordered a big guy breakfast...3 eggs , hashbrowns, bacon etc. I GOT ONE PIECE OF TOAST AT \"TOAST\". Followed up with breakfast at Flipside Cafe. Huge difference. Texas toast natural eggs tons of hashbrowns. Very nice family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Get there early on Sunday morning to beat the crowd.  Toast provides coffee while you do wait!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was wonderful; didn't have to wait  long for food. The food was very tasty; much like the name of the restaurant.  I enjoyed everything.  Definitely a must visit for anyone visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"Very great menu of breakfast and lunch fare, super service and prices reasonable. Went for lunch with 3 yr old grandson, wife and son.  They had been there prior and wanted me to have the experience.    It was difficult trying to choose just what I wanted to eat.  I narrowed it down to four items and finally settled on lobster rolls and a cup of soup.  Soups are made in-house and mine was a delicious blend of avacado. corn, and other things I forget but it was yummy.  Lobster roll was a pleasant surprise as they loaded the rolls with 3 ounces each of quality lobster.  All claws and arms.  They were so darn good I could not believe it.  And for $13 which I thought a deal.  Coffee is nicely on the strong side, the way coffee should be and refills kept coming.  You don't have \"your\" server but every server is your server and it works really well.  There were four servers and they worked seamlessly as a team.  And all were really friendly and not in a patronizing way, either.  Hard floor, walls and ceiling made it a noisy experience, so not a place for romance or conversation.    A place to return a visit."}
{"text":"Me and 'Toast' are no strangers. Several visits to the quaint Davidson location and occasionally the one at Concord Mills, I'm known to be a fan of their food.  I'm not huge on the 'every server is your server' routine, mostly because you don't really get to make a connection with a particular server. It's just nice to be able to remember one person's name and have a bit of chit chat. I digress, this restaurant's staff has better chemistry than the other two I've been to. I think it all boils down to communication. I've had instances in Davidson where my drink sat empty for a while and when someone finally came by they apologized and admitted that they thought someone else was taking care of it. Not an issue here at University though. Fast, friendly servers that seem to have it down.  I got the Huevos Rancheros as I've been on a particular crave for this lately (and am currently seeking a Mediterranean version of this classic, would pay good money for one). The food came out promptly and at first I thought I had made a horrible mistake, I didn't get any meat! What's breakfast without meat (apologies to my herbivore friends)?! As I sat there already a bit disappointed (in myself) I quickly changed my tune. Perfect over-easy eggs, great seasoning on the beans, very crispy tortilla strips, a generous helping of avocado, and topped with salsa. Between the protein in the beans and all the carbs, I was fully satisfied. I'm the mirror opposite of a vegetarian but I do gotta admit that this dish was very balanced, tasty, and satisfying just the way it is.  A couple of notes for your dining experience: The breakfast and lunch menu are both served all day. They do have a well stocked bar with the usual like Bloody Marys and Mimosas (just make sure it's past 10am, unlike us) as well as some speciality indulgences. It would be nice if the staff had a simpler way to split checks, but I don't blame them for the confusion as our table, all consisting of diehard Yelpers trying to earn a silly badge, we're splitting a check six ways.  My suggestion is to get here early as on the weekends the tables fill up fast. Either way its worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch with my toddler and her grandparents. Everyone was very happy with their meals. Servers were attentive and kind to the baby who was kept occupied with a blank kids menu and crayons. My French toast was delicious and didn't even need syrup. Husband's omelette was cooked perfectly - not just a mess of scrambled eggs. Coffee was tasty. Prices are a bit on the high side... Paid $75 for 4 meals and coffee (including the tip). Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Can't believe this place has received only 3.5 stars ! It's totally worth 5 stars !!  It was very crowded on a Sunday morning and we waited for 40 mins to be seated.  The food came out a little cold but the manager took care of it when we brought that into his knowledge.  Basically, Yummy food and Great Service. Perfect brunch place !"}
{"text":"The menu has a decent variety of food. A friend and I both ordered the Huevo's Ranchero's. Good flavor, however both our meals were lacking the tortilla portion, which we would have relayed to the waiter had we been checked on after the food was dropped off. So, to sum it up, our food lacked one of the main ingredients, and after the order was taken, the next time a server came to our table was to collect our plates."}
{"text":"It was a good, quick brunch. The service, however, could use some polishing for the price you're paying at Toast!  Arrived at prime brunch service on Saturday and had a brief 10 minute wait for a table. We got seated and they took our orders quickly.   First up, my Southwest Scramble was really good. I wasn't in a spicy mood so I subbed the Jalapeños for green onions and glad I did, it worked great with the rest of the scramble. Corn, tomatoes, onion, cheddar jack, cooked well. Sourdough toast was great but had to wait a while for someone to come by with butter, got a little cold. Their bacon is nice and thick, which gives it a nice crisp while still having a bit of meaty chew in the middle!  Girlfriend was a bit under the weather and ordered a simple bowl of grits and two over-medium eggs. They arrived at the table and the second server at this point noticed they were over easy. She took them as is without fuss. Overall was happy with her meal.  I've said this about the Davidson location and this one has the same issue: The \"Every server is your server\" works but communication is key! My cup was empty for much of my brunch, but then after I was almost done I had two servers ask what I was drinking. My original server brought me a soda, then the other brought me one. A third (who I believe was actually the hostess that seated us) then showed up with yet another soda.. I was a little confused as were they.  The other issue is the fact that with this concept, no one really takes 'ownership' of individual tables. We were seated by the hostess, our drink and food orders were taken by one server, the food was brought out by another, our original server brought me one drink, two others brought out the other two, then someone else brought out the check. Usually at a sit-down restaurant someone at least says \"Hi, how are you\" or \"Thanks, have a great day!\" but this was not the case today.  I don't always expect incredible service, but the prices at Famous Toastery warrant that expectation. I mean, $2.99 for a 'bowl' of plain grits that should really be called a 'cup' of grits. A small OJ is $4... Yeah, I would like just a little sliver of hospitality. I hope Saturday's visit was just a fluke, otherwise the Davidson location has this one beat on service."}
{"text":"Be sure to get here early, especially on weekends there can be a crowd in front waiting! That said, it is definitely worth the wait. There are not many places where you can get an absolutely delicious benedict. This is also one of the few restaurants in the charlotte-surrounding area that serves breakfast specials, changing it up seasonally! So far I have only been for breakfast but I am looking forward to trying their lunch menu.  While the food is absolutely worth the frequent wait time, the only other thing I'd dock off the experience is the server setup. At the top of the menu you'll see the phrase \"Every server is your server.\" Every time I've been here it seems like I start with one server who for the most part takes care of us. About halfway through it seems that we always get 2 or 3 others who are doing their best but seem preoccupied on other guests. It seems like the idea is good on paper, but when it gets really busy the wait staff appear a bit lost with all the guests. Still not a sub-par service issue, just not stellar. But hey, breakfast this good I don't care if the Devil himself is my waiter!"}
{"text":"Toast has gone completely downhill over the past couple of years...to the point where it is little more than a \"greasy spoon\" with more selection.    I was originally enamored with this place because of its location and the quaintness of the establishment.  Their breakfast menu is impressive, comprised of gluten-free pancakes, smoked salmon and eggs, mimosas, eggs benedict, stuffed french toast among regular favorites such as omelets, grits, eggs, and bacon.    But popularity of the restaurant has led to a crowded restaurant where patrons are packed in like sardines and a \"get em in and get em out\" mentality.  This translates to the quality of the food.  From the time you place your order to the time you receive your plate it takes about 10 minutes.  This is with a very crowded restaurant.  How is this possible?  \"Fresh Fruit\" isn't fresh but frozen fruit that is thawed.  Bacon isn't drained but thrown on a plate where grease pools into the bottom of the plate, eggs are over-seasoned, greasy and burned.  You could sop up two napkins full of the butter/grease on pancakes that come out.  Coffee tastes little better than diner coffee.  Tea is Bigelow brand.  At my most recent visit I made mistake of ordering the New Yorker:  smoked salmon, scrambled eggs and onions.  The salmon was poor quality (fishy) and the onions were white not the typical red (no capers) and the whole mess was chopped up and mixed together and thrown in a greasy pile on my plate with a side of freshly thawed fruit with ice still in the middle.  At $10 a plate I expect more.  This review is based on the last several meals I have had at Toast by myself and with family members.  No one was impressed and none said they would return...including myself."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot. The blueberry gluten free pancakes are the best I have ever had. Love the fresh squeezed OJ and adding a side of bacon make the meal."}
{"text":"This is always my go to brunch spot. The wait is never as long as other places in Charlotte and the food is always great. -1 star though because the service can be a bit frustrating. They bring the check out with your food and then never come by again. So hope you don't need any refills or anything else to go with you meal after it's brought out. Luckily there are plenty of servers, bussers, etc running around so you can flag them down if you need to but it would be nice not to have to as it makes me feel rude and annoying. Food comes out quickly though which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday morning and it was pretty busy! The atmosphere here is nice, and they have a great patio area. Service was good.  The food here was fine, decently made food, but nothing special. I had the French toast and my husband had a breakfast platter with eggs and hashbrowns and toast. You would think for a place called famous toastery they might have some really awesome homemade bread, but that is not the case. The menu is pretty average, and so is the food. But the price tag for breakfast is way too high.  Not worth it IMO."}
{"text":"The food was good but the portions were small, and over priced. A cheese and egg sandwich is $5+, everything appears to be à la carte. The service is not bad, except when you walk in no one has truly been there to greet you, we sort of just stood around wondering what to do. Every server there is your waiter/waitress. This is not a restaurant for me."}
{"text":"This location is awful.  We came for breakfast with our 2 year old and 8 year old.   We were seated in a corner, got our drinks and watched for 20 minutes while other tables were seated and ordered.  When we finally ordered, we asked for cornbread and were told it was in the oven, which is funny because they seated a couple at the table next to us and served them cornbread immediately.  When we asked for cornbread as well, we were told it was baking (still??).  After an hour we still had nothingbut drinks.   Maybe they lost our order?   We decided to leave.    Locations at Davidson and Concord are much better."}
{"text":"Strange service and mediocre food. We came for brunch around 10:30 on a Saturday. The restaurant was crowded but we did not have to wait. A server came immediately to take our drink orders. Our water came promptly but I never received my coffee or saw that server again.  We felt rushed the entire meal as several different servers came up to take our order within a few minutes of being seated and throughout which felt very impersonal (like they wanted to get us out as quickly as possible).  They also gave us the check with the food witch came out promptly but was bland and my bellini was too sweet. Overall a very poor experience--I have no idea how they have return customers."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast joints in the QC! Everything I have had here has been awesome. From the Cali Benny, crab cake Benedict to the runner omelet- you can't go wrong! Btw the Cali Benny is my go to (eggs Benedict topped with tomato and avocado with home fries).  I usually try to stay away from the \"common\" breakfast items when I go out to eat (eggs, toast, sausage), because, well, I can make that at home. However the biscuits and gravy here is amazing! It's one of the best I've ever had. It's creamy, spicy and cheesy. My husband and I always order a side of it every time we come here. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Service excellent, friendly staff, food out fast. The omelette with spinach, mushrooms and I choose cheddar cheese was tasty and huge! I like the sourdough toast and coffee was good black. Go with hungry-- large portions. We arrived 9:30am on Sunday and sat immediately but when we left around 10:30 line was out the door and every table full."}
{"text":"Excellent food, the most attentive servers I have ever seen, and great scenery being able to look out over the water as we ate."}
{"text":"I eat here pretty regularly. The staff is always friendly and professional. I appreciate that they make everything to order and in house. They have a lot of gluten free options when I go out with friends with dietary issues. If you are looking for Breakfast or Brunch in Belmont, this is the place."}
{"text":"Another extension of Toast in Davidson  Business model for Toast in Davidson changed about a year or so ago and rather than an Organic Expansion, they opted to use the franchise model to expand and since then, a number of these have opened in the area. This is one of the newer ones along with Concord Mills and Indian Land SC.  Davidson was nice when it opened and then it because a victim of it's success with long lines, awful wait times and poor service all in cramped conditions.  This is not a review of that store but rather as they have expanded, the newer stores have more room and can accommodate more people. They still have the tiny tables that they did in the original store and with the additional space, should be able to hire more waitstaff and improve service. Unfortunately not the case.  My wife and I went to the location in University Place this past Monday which was July 4th. Walked in and were promptly seated at a small table in the middle of the room but we did not see a server for over 5 minutes. I was ready to leave when one finally showed up.  I will admit from that point on, service did get better. Presented us with menu's and took our beverage orders and after we did place the orders, they did have our meal out within a reasonable length of time.  My wife order a Quiche with a side of fruit. One of her complaints about sides of fruit is that most of them have a few berries on top but the balance is mostly melon and that was the case here. She did indicate that her quiche was very good.  As for myself, on the menu that had three specials each named for a Presidential contender. The Hillary was a salad with West Coast theme, don;t remember what was the Bernie and the Trumplet was an omelet stuffed with meatloaf. Since I like meatloaf, I order the Trumplet.  Please note that because I ordered the Trumplet, in no was is this to be construed to mean I am a Trump supporter. If that was the case, I would have been very disappointed because the meatloaf inside the omelet was extremely dry and overcooked with little flavor.  What flavor there was came from the Pico de Gallo served on the side.  All in all, this is one of the better and I hope as the restaurant is there for awhile, it get even better.  Cuisine is creative but preparation is average. Service once you get acknowledged the first time is really not bad and atmosphere is not too back except for the cramped feel from the very time tables all pushed together."}
{"text":"A big disappointment with seating and ambiance.  My  wife and I have been customers or Toast and later the franchise concept known as Famous Toastery since the original Toast opened in Huntersville in what is now Cafe 100 many years ago.  My wife likes them and I have mixed feelings because they run a thin line between a close intimate feel and the feeling of total crowding with everyone within elbow length of each other. Some pull off the close intimate feel while some do not.  Looking at the dining area, this would appear to be one of the later.  We did not get to find that out however.  Drove over from Cornelius yesterday which was a Saturday and got there afternoon expecting to have to wait a bit. We did wait a couple but them the went ahead a seated us at the worst table I can think of in many years of dining.  In the back of the restaurant, past the server station and on the way to the restrooms are two tables. We were seated at one of the two with a view of the end of the restaurant down a long hallway and constant traffic to the bathroom.  Despite a line and wait list, they never did seat anyone at the second table behind me although it did appear that one of the employees temporarily parked one of her children here.  Problem with tables in the \"out of sight, out of mind\" zone like this is that service can be sporadic and lacking. Service did start out satisfactory but as lunch progressed, we saw less and less of our server and from the time we were served lunch, by someone other than our server, we never saw her again till our check was presented at the table.  I've always liked the Toast menu because it is fresh and original. This was no exception.  My wife ordered a California Salad and requested they hold the Avocado.  I have the Left Coast BLT which is a BLT with Avocado and comes with a side of Pesto Salad.  Needless to say we have different tastes.  My wife made the comment that she enjoyed the Salad and the Chicken taste like chicken and was very fresh.  My Left Coast BLT was very good as well.  Needless to say, not a fan of this particular restaurant because of this reason."}
{"text":"I happened to be driving through Tega Cay and saw Toast as I was looking for somewhere to stop for breakfast. It looks like a renovated fast food building, but the service is awesome and the food is great. The wait at 10 am on Saturday was only a few minutes, and they've got classics and some more interesting items on the menu. I had an avocado omelet, which I thought was pretty good considering I would have never thought to mix avocado and eggs. Portion sizes are pretty large, so the food is good and you're definitely getting what you pay for. Would definitely recommend for friends!"}
{"text":"We normally eat at the Toast in Concord and love it! This location however was not the same experience. We were told 30 minutes for our wait which ended up being an hour (and several other folks with similarly sized parties that arrived after us, sat before us). The waitstaff was the saving grace, they were friendly and attentive and the gentleman that took care of us was awesome. The food however was terrible. All of the pancakes were burnt, there were several mistakes in our order (4 out of 9 of us had something wrong with our order). All in all it was disappointing. Not coming back"}
{"text":"Service is on point. We had to wait for about 10/15 minutes b/c it was a Sunday but not to bad of a wait.   Our waitress was attentive and prompt. She even gave me another drink when I ordered the wrong thing. We ordered the shrimp and grits which was. Eye good but it had very few shrimp in it and they were tiny. There were definitely more sausage than shrimp too.  Overall it was a good meal, including the Irish cream coffee and rum-mimosa. However it's very expensive, $21 a piece for one drink and an entree at brunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic little breakfast joint. My friends and I got seated right away, had great service and were out the door in about an hour. We had two little kids in our party and they were brought food out first and for kids under 6 thats always a smart thing! The french toast looked amazing and i was wishing i had ordered that! The biscuits and gravy were a bit too buttery but the fruit plate was ripe and was really really good paired with my eggs over medium and sourdough toast. Great place for families!"}
{"text":"Good selection of breakfast and brunch items. Cool place with great service. The left coast BLT was very interesting and quite good. Pasta salad was pretty bland and nothing to write home about. Mac n cheese was unique and tasty however it was very heavy. Left us feeling ready to take a nap. Price was reasonable. Happening place for brunch. Strongly suggested"}
{"text":"They've lost the original magic.  We live in Cornelius, NC, about 5 minutes from the original store in Davidson.  Toast was originally one of our favorite places for Sunday brunch when the opened years ago. Apparently it was the favorite of a lot of other people and it quickly out grew the tiny space it occupied on Main Street but they never moved out.  Consequently service at this location suffered. To compensate, they started to open other stores throughout the area.  This one in Tega Cay is one of the more recent additions.  Decided to give it a try since we were in the area yesterday and unfortunately it proved to be a disappontment.    To start with, we were shuttled to the covered patio after being told that we would have to wait if we wanted inside.  We reluctantly agreed and walked by four tables ready to go as we were escorted to our table which fortunately was next to the fireplace. (Remember this is February).  While they were prompt in taking our order and food came out fairly promptly, after that we never saw our server again and had to flag down other servers to get coffee refills and in the end, our check.  My wife said her wrap was OK but my meatload sandwich was very bland with no flavor and the potatoe salad side was so undercooked, the potatoes had a crunch and a raw taste to them.  Service was lacking and the food quality was not there.  That said, this is not an indictment of the whole chain.  The Toast is Dilworth is still run by one of the founders and they have managed to hold onto the qualities that drew us to Toast in the first place.  Hopefully, some of the other expansion locations have manged to hold onto the original princlples and have grown."}
{"text":"Best Service of any of the Toast / Famous Toastery Locations  My wife loves the Davidson location which is still a Toast and the second one they opened. My problem here has always been the service and the extraordinary long wait times, both to get a table and then once you're seated, the wait thereafter.  We walked into this location at 11:00 am after Church and they were in full swing. Parking lot was packed and people were waiting for people to leave to grab a parking spot.  Walked in with trepidation. The waiting area was packed as was the rest of the restaurant and patio area. My wife asked how long a wait and was told 15- 20 minutes. Based on experience, my answer was I have to see it to believe it.  Had a seat in the waiting area and had a complimentary cup of coffee and 10 minutes later our name was called.  Talk about a pleasant shock.  We were promptly seated, menus presented along with the complimentary corn bread, and beverage orders for our teas taken.  This chain is having fun with the 2016 Presidential Elections. At least some one has a sense of humor.  When we ate at the Famous Toastery at University City, I had the Trumplet which is an Omelet stuffed with meatloaf.  This time at this location, I ordered the Bernie Scramble with is Scrambled Eggs with Salmon, Cream Cheese and Capers along with Sauted Vegetables as a side.  Great variation on Lox and Bagles and it was very creative and more importantly, very tasty.  My wife was more traditional and had the Meatloaf with Mashed Potatoes which is one of her favorites.  Needless to say, we both enjoyed our meal.  Still can not say enough about how well this restaurant is run. Even with restaurants with reputations for excellent service, good customer flow management, this one is one of the best I have ever seen.  Excellent Restaurant and we will be back. Christmas is coming up which means many trips to Concord Mills and this is a very viable dining option."}
{"text":"Drove here from Mooresville with the bf for breakfast last weekend. He highly recommended it. The restaurant was very busy but you didn't get that sense from the staff. They made sure that everyone was served promptly, though oddly enough, we waited about twice as long for our breakfast on Saturday morning when it was packed as opposed to Monday, when there were empty tables all around.   A few of our favs: the egg white omelette with turkey, veggies and brie; the Greek omelette, and the blueberry pancakes. I hear the bacon is good, too, but to be fair, I didn't try it so I can't vouch for it.   We also enjoyed a stroll around the campus (European style) after eating and then perused the farmers market. A lovely way to spend a weekend morning! Can't wait to head back to Toast for a repeat."}
{"text":"The only saving grace is that the people are nice.   I was SO excited for Toast to open in Dilworth. What a disappointment.  To begin, the corn bread they give you has negative taste. Awful. My omlet had no taste, my coffee had grinds in it, and despite a million workers running around like ants, the service was very slow, i had to ask for more coffee twice, had to ask them to remove old plates when the new ones came out, and it was just gross. Never going back."}
{"text":"The perfect place if you enjoy fruit flies floating in your ice water and biscuits that are hard as rocks."}
{"text":"I really was looking forward to a delicious breakfast similar to the ones I've had in the Davidson location. I hate to say I was disappointed. I ordered the SPG omelet-spinach, mushroom, gruyere- and a side of crispy bacon. The food came out very quickly and while it looked nice, it was just okay. The cheese wasn't melted at all, it was like a slice of hard cheese inside the slightly warm spinach and mushrooms. There really was not a lot of flavor to it. The bacon was indeed crispy but more to the point of burned not crispy. The biscuit was amazing.  The wait service was A+.  Wish I had better things to say."}
{"text":"Better than most Famous Toastery (Toast) but still very long wait.  We've tried on two other occasions to dine here but decided not to have to wait 45 minutes each time. This time, we decided to wait them out after Church since we had basically a free afternoon.  Got there at 10:40am and were told 30 minutes. At 11:30, my wife went up to ask how much longer and we were seated about 5 minutes after that.  There is a fine line with this chain with a fast paced, intimate restaurant on one side and a very rushed dining experience with every patron packed on top of each other.. Fortunately this is one of the first type described.  Tables were not spaced just a couple of feet from each other and while you did not have to wait for anything, staff was helpful and we did  not feel rushed.  I had an experience at one of these restaurants were i stood up to put on my jacket while I waited for my wife to return from the ladies room and was almost knocked off my feet by some trying to bus the table I was standing next too.  This was a pleasant experience.  Looking over the menu, my wife chose the California Salad with Chicken, nuts, cranberries etc with a Raspberry Vinaigrette. She's not a fan of Avocado's so I ended up with them. She really enjoyed her salad  I had a Grilled Chicken Sandwich and they let me substitute Potato Salad for the Pasta Salad. The Chicken Sandwich was great but probably should have stayed with the Pasta Salad. The Potato Salad was very bland and with almost a powdery texture. They don't use a bit of mustard to give a counterbalance to what is otherwise a very bland dish.  This is one of the better one's in terms of ambiance and service. Maybe over time, the newness will wear off and you won't have to wait 40 minutes for a table. More are planned for the area including one where the Daily Grind was at it Mooresville so maybe supply will catch up with demand."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch, and though the service was great, my actual meal was only average. Everyone else in my group seemed to have ordered something better than I did, but I was not impressed with my Avocado Omelet. It had avocado, tomato, bacon, and Parmesan and came with choice of breakfast potatoes, grits, or fruit and a side of toast for $10.99. I chose grits and an English muffin. Pretty expensive for such common ingredients to create something so mediocre. I hardly had any avocado or bacon, and of the bacon that I had, it was salty and hard. The egg was dry and lackluster. The grits were fine. Overall, I was not impressed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is lucky that the food is amazing because the service is absolutely awful every time I go. The whole \"every server is your server\" thing isn't really working out apparently because then no server ends up being our server. Once they drop the food they drop the check and never check back to even see if we need drink refills or if we liked the food. I always leave pissed off because people continually walk by and look at us but nobody ever cares to ask if we need anything. Food is amazing but the service gets zero stars from me."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  There are better Non-chain in the area to go to like Georgia's or Pearlee and Cilles"}
{"text":"It's about time the Tega Cay/Fort Mill area got itself a decent breakfast place. Best part is you can get breakfast all day! Yaya! My favorites are by far the weekend  waffles with berry compote, hubby always steels my bacon and the coconut  pancakes. Then there's the comped cornbread with apple butter on the weekends. That haunts me all week long. Wow I love them. When I'm feeling the belly comin' on from the holiday weight or I'm training for a marathon I reach for a big ol beautiful Greek Salad that I add their awesome grilled  tofu too. Always hits the spot. So, so glad to see you Toast! Don't ever change."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service just as I've come to expect from Famous Toastery. The porch is outstandingly warm with huge heaters and a great fireplace. This one's a keeper. My top faves: coconut pancakes, belgium waffles, and the California salad, yum!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to update to 5 stars. This time the eggs were perfect! The Borsin omelette was amazing and as always the staff is top notch."}
{"text":"I first came here with my mom and we got a table in the corner looking over the boardwalk. The view was the perfect start to brunch. Their multiple service method ensures fast and genuine service. Finally the food. To die for would be an understatement. I usually get the blueberry pancakes and they are so amazingly fluffy and perfect. Great place to get a bite!"}
{"text":"i sent my omelette back because it was very bland, no flavor to it at all. I also ordered their choc chip pancake and that too was very bland and cheap tasting. I could have made a tastier breakfast at home. I can't say they're any better than ihop or waffle house. Save your money and eat at home"}
{"text":"I love toast, so of course I had to eat here!  And as soon as I saw they served a meatloaf sandwich on sourdough bread, no further contemplation of the menu was required.     My sandwich was accompanied by potato salad and they were both very good. I liked the comfortable atmosphere in the restaurant, and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Arrived at about 8 on a Wed morning. Got seated right away. Everything clean and neat. Could use some more decoration on the walls - very plain. I ordered some eggs w/ grits and was told that the grits got a late start this morning and weren't ready yet. my assosciate also ordered eggs. We waited at least 20 minutes for the food. The place was next to empty. It was not acceptable. Food was good, but the toast comes not buttered and by the time you try to butter it yourself, it is too cold to melt. Country ham was somewhat dried out. Fresh squeezed orange juice was kind of weird - I wonder what kind of oranges they use. Overall OK, but not if your in a hurry."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends as a celebration of my last day of work. The seating process was quick. Our food and beverages came out in a timely manner. We did feel very rushed from our waitress. She printed out everyone's bill as soon as our food came out. It made us feel abandoned from her and if we wanted to order another mimosa, it would be an inconvenience. I did love how there was constantly someone coming over to refill coffee. The food was good, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"This review is for the service, not the food, as we didn't stay long enough to try it.   My friends and I (four total) arrived for brunch on a busy Saturday morning and were informed that there was a 25 minute wait for a table.  My husband asked the hostess if we could have a coffee at the bar while we waited and she said sure.  From the minute we sat down the server behind the bar was extremely rude and acted as though she couldn't wait to get rid of us.  She informed us there was free coffee outside, and repeatedly questioned us as to how long we planned to sit at the bar.  We politely told her that we were just planning to have a cup of coffee and would move as soon as our table was ready.  After a few minutes she came back and told us that we needed to move because she needed to seat people at the bar.  When we explained what the hostess had told us, she said \"well she was wrong and you need to move because we need to seat people here who are going to eat brunch at the bar.\"  At that point we'd had enough of her attitude and asked to speak to the manager.  I explained that there had been a miscommunication and that while we wouldn't have minded waiting elsewhere, we didn't appreciate the unwarranted rude treatment from the bartender.  He was apologetic, but at that point we had such a bad taste in our mouths about the place that we just left.  We went to La Patisserie in Mooresville and had an amazing brunch with the friendliest service.  Go there instead!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience at all. Bad service topped off with mediocre food. Cold/stale cornbread when you sit down...and my toast was burnt. Had the southwestern omelet...with greasy chorizo. You can drive 1.5 mile down east blvd. to Bad Daddy's Burger Bar for a much better experience and food."}
{"text":"First time guest & I was blown away! Food was great! I had the smg omelette which was good, but the thing that got me was the strawberry French toast. It was so great! I'll definitely try a full order next time. The mimosas were really good, fresh squeezed oj. The service was great as well, I forgot his name but I remember he was from New York. Very charismatic & friendly, everyone else was friendly as well. There will definitely be a second time!"}
{"text":"Fast service, friendly staff and tasty cuisine... We decided to skip the hotel free breakfast and venture out. We are very glad we did; the breakfast was great..."}
{"text":"A few coworkers and I came here for breakfast after our shift at the hospital and it definitely hit the spot! I had the northwest omelet (which was herbs and goat cheese) with hash browns and toast with a pineapple mimosa, and it was all delicious! My coworkers are completely obsessed with their apple cinnamon pancakes which I definitely plan to try next time I am there! The place is very quaint and the staff were all very welcoming and friendly! Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience, great food and staff.   Awesome ice tea.  Parking is a little jacked when busy but a real treat nonetheless.  Prices are above average for a breakfast lunch place but it is welcomed in an area overfilled with fast food options.   A great restaurant for a limited supply for exit 23 in Huntersville.    Closes at 3pm."}
{"text":"Nothing special will not be back.  Way too pricey for average food.  Maybe it deserves 3 stars but I typically reserve that for a place that I will give a 2nd chance.  No need with this place, they just have average overpriced food."}
{"text":"My favorite is French toast and I ordered the Blah Blah Blah omelette, French toast and potatoes! Y'all those potatoes spoke to my heart lmbo ! Everything was Great! I actually ordered to go because of course it's a little busy in the morning because it's a great brunch spot which closes at 3! But it was great inside and a great location! It tastes so great! Super yummy!"}
{"text":"Tried a soup to start off with, what kind eludes me now but it was so salty I couldn't eat it. Tried giving it to my friend who puts extra salt on everything and she couldn't even eat it.  Got the meatloaf and ended up not eating it due to it having a very strong mustard taste? Other's at the table tried it and agreed.    I will say this though, our waitress offered to take it off the check when she saw me not eating, and offered to get me something else. She acted like this wan't the first time someone didn't want the meatloaf and honestly acted a bit embarrassed about it."}
{"text":"I was quite surprised to find no reviews for Toast when it is so popular at its other location and the fact that Charlotte is severely lacking quality, unique, breakfast spots.  A Sunday brunch after an extra hour on the clock and a Groupon offer, it's no wonder there was a wait, only 20 minutes for a table for 2 though. Fortunately it was a beautiful November day and the 5 outdoor tables were in use as well.    Just ran out of orange juice? Hopefully that means it truly is fresh...although i saw some food lion bags of OJ to the rescue...hmm.  Couldn't resist the Southwest Scramble, its hard for me to avoid anything with jalapeños. The Southwest Scramble was a perfect blend of spice and flavor. Seems like an easy thing to whip up at home, but it would never turn out like that. Egg, Chorizo, jalapeños, corn salsa with cheese melted on top and a side of potatoes. The potatoes had a little hint of something that distinguished themselves in a good way from being just potatoes.  The one thing that's not really my thing is that with all the people, this place gets noisy and for someone like me that doesn't have the vocal capabilities without alcohol to converse in noisy settings, it puts a strain on my meal conversation.   Service was tag team style. Efficient and friendly despite running around frantically. Our table was low on jelly and creamer type items, but they were quick to retrieve when you caught them running by.   All in all, It's not quite as cozy as the Davidson location but it's a much needed brunch spot for Charlotte worth checking out."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Everything was so good. The service was also great. Will definitely be back. I had the peach Bellini and it was refreshing. The huevos rancheros plate is really yummy."}
{"text":"Gazpacho!!!  Yesterday we were visiting the Art Galleries in the area and had already eaten lunch when I saw the sign outside said Gazpacho I had to get some!  It was very Good!  This is a cool restaurant with Incredible service!!!"}
{"text":"We were driving and just happen to see the Toast Mascot out on the corner. So we decided to stop by and check it out. I'm so glad we did. Toast of Dilworth is small restaurant that serve a great menu. I'm a fan of their stuffed French toast. Based on the line that there every weekend(kind of reminds me of the Portlandia Brunch Episode) they have a loyal following. If you haven't been you much go."}
{"text":"If a 0 was possible, I'd give zero. The service was horrible. No one was our server.  When someone finally came over, she had an attitude. The food was cold. The waffle was soggy. The 3 tables surrounding us ALL complained. I'll never visit this location."}
{"text":"Sign at the door said the seat yourself and I did.  Restaurant is smaller than Concord or Ballantyne versions; not as cramped as original Toast in Davidson. Fairly busy noon Friday lunch.  Took 18 minutes for some one to acknowledge my presences--the waitress who took my order. Coffee and water came quickly thereafter.  Custom omelette with mushrooms, pepper and sausage took another 16 minutes; 35 minutes after I had initially sat down.  When it was time to pay, no one was manning the register, so the line was 5 deep. I remained seated until the line wore down; another 5 minutes delay.  I genuinely enjoyed my meal, just don't come if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"My kids love the stuffed French toast, but it is a bit sweet for me. I prefer my omelet fillings to be mixed in with the eggs, instead of folded over.  The coffee could be improved. It is often difficult for me to get a 2nd cup on a Saturday. Overall it's OK, but there are less expensive places nearby that I prefer."}
{"text":"Love Sunday morning brunch here... Great service and great food! Also can't beat the $5 Mimosas"}
{"text":"Atmosphere inviting.....Excellent breakfast with great gluten free pancakes my wife loved....excellent service.   They always get the order correct when do you do take out. Generous portion sizes."}
{"text":"I absolutely love eating here. The food and service is exceptional. A great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast with a decent menu selection, although it's a bit odd you can't build your own omelette. I went with the combo with French toast, an egg, and sausage patties. Good, but not great. An expensive breakfast in my opinion."}
{"text":"Toast!  I've heard about this place for a while and finally got a chance to try it.  I was pretty impressed, I must say.  We pulled into the strip mall-ish location at about 9:15 and we must have timed it perfectly because we were immediately seated.  By the time we were getting ready to leave, there was quite a line out the door.  So, word to the wise, get there early!  The menu had a lot of your standard breakfast/brunch things, but it also had some more unique items that you won't find at your standard breakfast joint.  I really liked that they had a few options that incorporated the wonderful avocado.  There was also a tasty looking smoked salmon dish, and the French toast looked pretty awesome as well.  I, however, didn't go with any of those things.  I got the Runner (egg white omelet with turkey, peppers, brie, and mushrooms).  It was really good and left me feeling satisfied but not stuffed.  It came with toast (hence the name of the place) and grits.  I love me some good grits, and these were done right!    The prices were pretty reasonable, most of the meals were in the 8-10 dollar range.  They had $5 Bloody Mary's and mimosas as well.    All in all, this place met my expectations and it will be on my shortlist of go-to brunch places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Usually just being there is a good experience but today was an exception. Manager (female) was very rude, arrogant & controlling towards the 5 in our party. We were there 8 am & well before traffic & sat where we usually did but brought in an extra/new customer. Question to manager: Was getting 1 extra seat out of your rearranging worth offending 5 people? Have been going in there regularly on Sunday mornings for several years now but as there are now other places to go for Sunday breakfast, we will not come here so often. Love the servers & food but manager could use a personality upgrade!!"}
{"text":"Nice place, building is brand new. Very clean, excellent service. Food is quite good. Not cheap! Coffee is superb!"}
{"text":"There is nothing I like better than fantastic service with excellent food and that is what I got at Toast.    The decor is beautiful, the menu is excellent and the service is top notch! None of that \"I'll find your waiter\" because every member of the waitstaff is your waiter.    I'm looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed this restaurant however today was different I am giving this a five star rating because the food was great but the service was not so much until this nice waitress (Justine) was nice enough to stop by our table and took care of all the things that everyone else had over looked. Not only did she take care of us and our concerns she went and grabbed a manager who came over. When (Nicholas) came over he expressed his concern as well and expressed how he valued is being here and how he did not approve of how we were treat overall he treated us very well and that is why I will continue to come here because this is the type of service consumers should receive Thank you Justine and Nicholas"}
{"text":"Another breakfast favorite of mine - Toast of Dilworth provides great food and outstanding service.  Food is always prepared in an efficient and timely manner and the results are exceptional!  I love their stuffed strawberry french toast as well as their eggs benedict.  Their food just taste so fresh and amazing.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the look of the space.  The service is also good; however, the food left me a little underwhelmed each time I visited.  I eat a low carb gluten free diet, so was super stoked to learn that they had gluten free options.  I tried the gluten free pancakes: but it was a little bland.  In terms of trying to stay low carb, I felt like the majority of menu items were breaded except for the salads... and sometimes, a salad just won't do!  So in short, while I do like the fact that they don't over-salt everything like many restaurants, their breakfast and lunch foods (gluten free and otherwise) that I tried were a little boring to the taste buds, not great for low carb folks, but good if you want a mimosa or a coffee with a friend."}
{"text":"I have visited this location two times now. The first time I had cinnamon raisin French toast with bacon on whole wheat bread. It tasted like wet dog, but I gave this location a second chance with their flapjacks. I had the Heath bar and walnut flapjacks that were the special one day and they were to die for and they were delicious. Both times, the staff was more than friendly and attentive. I have visited them after 12pm and they were still as friendly as ever for a place that closes at 3pm."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday afternoon, the twenty minute wait was worth how attentive and nice the staff is. Drinks were good, food didn't take too long, and is a great place to take your family or friends for brunch. I like how this place is nice for groups."}
{"text":"Arrived around 9:45am on a Sunday morning. There was no wait and we were seated right away. I ordered the buttermilk waffle sans the berries and whip cream with bacon and 1 scrambled egg. My husband got the traditional eggs benedict with grits. Our coffee, water and fresh squeezed oj came our right away along with some fresh corn bread. The corn bread was really good!  Our food came maybe 10 minutes after we ordered, everything was really, really good! The bacon was a little too salty and hard to eat, but the meals overall was great.   We were sat by the large window in the back that overlooks the river which was really nice.  I think this place is a little pricey, it was $33 (before tip) for our whole meal, my small fresh squeezed oj was $4! It was good, but I don't know if the prices quiet match with the food."}
{"text":"Took a group of 25 there today.excellent service and food. Our favorite spot for brunch. Laura is a great Mgr."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect Sunday brunch place! They have amazing mimosas and even have orange creamsicle mimosas! I had gotten the Southwest omelette which I chose the sides of roasted potatoes and cinnamon toast with butter!  It was a perfectly balanced hearty breakfast. Would definitely go here again!!!!"}
{"text":"Their food is great! My biggest downside is the staff. They regularly get orders incorrect because of the \"every server is your server\" mindset. Last few times since opening we've gone and had to request things missing. I hate sending food back so I'll ask for fresh items to supplement because biscuits have come stale or plates have come out cold. Menu is extensive and very promising. Just check your order when it arrives."}
{"text":"The wait on weekends is crazy, but completely worth the wait.  To say the food is amazing, is an understatement!  The staff is also fantastic, very concerned about your experience."}
{"text":"I had a great experience with Toast Cafe in Davidson.  The manager did not make me pay for the food that we ordered. Details are on my blog; http://www.lakenormanhomesinfo.com/toast-cafe-in-davidson/"}
{"text":"We came for brunch on a Sunday. The wait time was very reasonable (only twenty minutes) and they even text you when your table is ready. I ordered two eggs poached with sourdough and received very runny eggs to the point you couldn't see the white and cold white toast. We also ordered the 'Country Benedict' that came out cold. Needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday morning. It was packed! We had to wait for 20 mins but it wasn't a waste of time."}
{"text":"Love this place... makes me want to move to Davidson just so I could go here more often! The breakfast is outstanding. Dinner was off the charts good and I sampled all four dishes ordered by our table. The Ahi Tuna was so perfect I felt drawn to become a worshiper of said fish, but alas, my Christianity will not be compromised... kidding! Seriously, the best of the best in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"Famous Toastery is my go to spot for easy brunch.  First time having the grilled chicken soup...it reminded me of Grandma.    But This ROARING 20's /Speakeasy playlist reminds me of my grandfather?"}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast spot. Busy on the weekend but the wait isn't too crazy. The food was good and the waitstaff was good as well. Definitely add this one to your breakfast restaurant selection."}
{"text":"My favorite dish here is the country benedict. It's an open faced biscuit with eggs, county ham and sausage gravy. I typically have them scramble my eggs with cheese. I get the house potatoes and have them add onions. My daughter loves the potatoes with onions and cheese. I've eaten at several locations and service, etc seems to be pretty consistent across the board. There are also lots of healthy options to choose from. Definitely give it a try if you've never had breakfast/brunch here."}
{"text":"First time here - usually avoid chains ... but - I needed a decent breakfast before a day of hard labor bestowed upon me by \"the warden\".... guess who that is ? Anyway - I had a great breakfast / excellent service and outstanding coffee (which makes everything better) it's Lavazza Dark Roast . Not a inexpensive place - but ... when everyone/ everything is excellent- who cares ?"}
{"text":"What a mistake it was to try this place for breakfast. We waited 25 minutes for a table, which wasn't unreasonable, but that's when things took a turn for the worse. After we were seated and placed our order, the waiter brought our coffee and then never came back. After waiting more than 30 minutes and still no food or coffee refills, we finally were able to flag down another waiter to ask for refills and inquire about our food. He came back saying our order would be right out but we continued to wait another 15 minutes and still no food. We finally got up and left. I did speak to someone who seemed to be a manager on our way out, who said our order was coming out and asked if we wanted to take it with us. Are you kidding me? After waiting 50 minutes with no waiter or manager coming by to check on us or explain the delay, we were completely fed up. And we won't be coming back. Non-existent service and a \"who cares\" attitude! There are to many good places in town for breakfast to put up with that."}
{"text":"I love everything on the menu. And there are so many options. The little sample cups of coffee when you walk in and are faced with a pretty long wait are a really nice touch. I always go for one of the breakfast options, it's everything you expect--they've got your bacon and your eggs and your omelettes and your breakfast platters. It's a perfect crowd pleaser, everyone in your group will be able to find something that they like."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend for brunch. No wait time, it was a weekday morning. Patio sitting was cool, even in 90 degree weather. Service was fast, and we loved the food. I had the Greek omelette, and friend had the Barney Special, lol!!! Servers were super friendly. Will be coming in again"}
{"text":"Food is fine and I would consider returning however it was very difficult to talk to a manager about my concerns after watching a waitress (older, white, blonde with glasses) exit the restroom without washing her hands."}
{"text":"I can't believe what used to be a bar... Turned into a brunch spot. Has it been that long since I've been in Charlotte? Well, at least north Charlotte? The Famous Toastery is a chain really that's located on the east coast, but this was actually the first time I ever heard of them. This place has been opened since April. When we came through it was quite busy and even though we didn't have any reservations or anything we were seated pretty quickly.   When we were seated, we noticed that every table had a basket of corn bread... But we didn't. So we asked for one and well they were prepping them, so this place made fresh corn bread which was pretty exciting. When we got a basket, it was pretty good.  The food... Something that caught our eyes was the Boursin Omelet, and well that's what we got. I ordered an extra side of bacon, because honestly...who could ever have enough bacon?  All in all I thought the omelet was well cooked and had a good amount of flavor. I think the cheese helped it a lot, and well that cheese was pretty delicious. The bacon I was on the fence on. The potatoes were good, and definitely plentiful. If you come here I have no doubt that you will get full.  One thing to note is that they have a lot of waiters, but getting their attention at times can be trying especially when they're busy. They should have been settled by now, hopefully. I think this place is a great addition to the University area and will definitely see a lot of business considering the location and how perfect it is to just stroll around the pond after the meal. All in all, I will probably come back here if I'm in the area and looking for a brunch spot."}
{"text":"While visiting our son and his family last weekend (April 28), we had lunch at this cute little restaurant.  We had our small dog with us, so ate outside on the patio.  What a pleasant experience.  The staff were very attentive and accommodating to our little buddy and us and the food was delicious.  Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I had almost written this place due to lack of clean food options. The food tastes pretty good yes, the service is pretty friendly yes, and it's easy because it's the biggest most often open restaurant in Davidson.  But the Heinz ketchup bottle on the table the Cisco whipped butter packets in the plastic containers,  corn syrup filled jelly ... Big red flags if one cares about m in the importance of good nutrition which as all evidence now points to equals clean ethically sourced, sustainable, organic, non-GMO foods. I stopped by this morning because my favorite clean restaurant is closed on Tuesday mornings, and was hungry! I was pleasantly surprised to learn the grits are kosher which is most likely nongmo ( although when they arrived whatever they had added to them was waxy and is clearly not a healthy addition)  and they're trying to source their foods in more conscientious way. The quality of the meat could not be attested to so I went with vegetarian option - the avocado Benedict although not organic or free range to the best of the original servers knowledge, was excellent as was the gluten-free multi grain toast. Pico de gallo on top taste quite fresh and homemade. I had the pleasure of me being advised on clean food choices at Toast by Helen who was well-informed   professional and sweet.  Slightly perplexed why the original server did not know what the food quality of the basic things on the menu was. Is it due to lack of interest in Davidson/the customers coming in don't ask, or lack of management educating the servers ?  This is a hot topic in this small town as evidenced by the wild and immediate success of the two clean food restaurants in the town, and the more customers ask the better things will get- hopefully soon we will be able to trust the food we are being served without probing inquiry  :-)"}
{"text":"Love Toast! I have been here three different times AND I have also had their catering.  Every time I have been very happy with what I ordered.  Two times I have had a salad there, their salads are great and a must have for these hot summer months.  The other time I ate there, I got brunch, it was the southwestern scrambler and it was also delish, it had some spice to it so if you don't like spice then don't get this dish.  I also had a mimosa with brunch, it was great but if you don't like pulp then I would opt out of the mimosa if I were you, it was very pulpy.    I would also highly recommend their catering, Sarah is awesome and is the nicest person to deal with.  So all around, Toast is great!"}
{"text":"Service was good. We sat without silverware for a few minutes after getting our food. The food was just okay but $9 for a basic breakfast plate and $13 for an omelette seems a bit much. We'd go back and try lunch next time."}
{"text":"Professional, attentive, and friendly staff - excellent customer service. The food is consistently high quality - one of the best breakfasts in the CLT area, period. Get the scramble."}
{"text":"Our server was a gal. She was nice when she took our order. Brought the drinks, the runner brought our food and she popped up with the check and disappeared for the rest of breakfast. We literally did not even see her near us again. Thank goodness for Harry. He was our server. I don't know if that's his label but it should be. He was great, so nice, and there for any questions and boxes when we needed them. The food was perfect as always!"}
{"text":"The food is definitely good but some of the servers can be replaced.  I went with a group of friends for brunch, and sat on the patio.  My girlfriends and I have not seen each for awhile, so we had some catching up to do.  After our meal, we decided to stay on the patio and chat...wrong move.  Although the restaurant was pretty much empty at this point (it was 1:30 pm), the waiter seemed to be annoyed by the fact that we wanted to stay a little longer.  Oddly enough, we decided to sit on the patio and embrace the heat because we knew that we would be there for awhile and we did not want to needlessly occupy a table inside.  As I said earlier, the waiter did not care that we had all just gotten together after a long time; the waiter acted as if she wanted us to leave immediately.  Ultimately, we decided to leave and head to Starbucks and chat there.  I will visit there again but I will NOT go with a group of people because I hate the feeling of knowing the waiter wants you to leave."}
{"text":"Service is great. Shrimp and grits is delicious. I also had the avocado cooked with eggs and fruit! Usually this particular dish is delicious and well cooked! My eggs were over cooked and I couldn't even finish my plate.  Normally a place where everything is done right. This visit just wasn't that for me."}
{"text":"Toast is awesome!  I am not sure I can say more than the other 98 reviews, except that go early on the weekend, because it is packed!"}
{"text":"For the lunch break of my second day of work ever, my girlfriend and I decided to try The Toast Cafe, which I had heard about from a compelling newspaper review. She had been before in Charlotte and the Davidson area, but this particular one was going to be a new experience for us both. As opposed to Father's Day, when it was predictably packed and impossible to obtain a table, the Tuesday lunch hour provided a lull for accessibility. She had already gotten a table and water by the time I arrived, shortly after she did. I ordered a club sandwich, and she got a Western Omelette. I was surprised and impressed by how quickly the food arrived at our table after we ordered. Hers looked good, and mine tasted great. As opposed to many club sandwiches, which are unwieldy and almost unmanageable in their size, this one was just about perfect for an afternoon meal. Her side hash browns looked incredible. The potato salad was pretty decent, but it wasn't terribly remarkable. I could've done with an option for French fries or maybe soup/salad. No big deal there though. The sandwich was the star of this show, and it delivered. She said the omelette was excellent as well. The atmosphere is very nice, casual and laid back, and there is porch seating for fresh air as well. One thing: it is kind of confusing when dealing with staff because their policy is apparently that every waiter is your waiter. While this can be helpful for both patrons and staff members, it does kind of take away from the personal touch one may usually find at other restaurants. Overall though, it was a great experience. I imagine we'll be back there soon."}
{"text":"Myself and coworkers went here for breakfast one morning.I always hear about this place but I didn't find it that fascinating.I also don't believe they have a lot of options,at least options I was used to as a combination meal I guess.It could have just been what I had a taste for that day.Not sure though!I ordered all my food from the sides menu and french toast.The bacon was so tasty...very fresh and a thick slice.  Customer service was decent.However,I didn't like the payment method.I'm not sure if you usually have to go up front to the bar to pay for your food but we had to since each of our meals were separate.It was such an inconvenience to have to wait in a line of 30 people (all coworkers) to each pay for our food.This is the only restaurant I've been to that ever did that."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people that really like this place so have been many times but just don't understand it.  I'm admittedly not a big breakfast fan - which is certainly their focus - but I've tried almost everything on their lunch menu and a few things on their breakfast menu and have just never had anything very good.  At this point, the only thing I will order is a side of fruit and an English muffin.  Their specials do often sound interesting but have always disappointed me.  There's often a wait on weekend morning, but they do a good job getting people in quickly, especially if you have a smaller party.  The location in Dilworth is also a positive."}
{"text":"The food was good especially the hashbrowns. The wait staff was very friendly, nice and attentive. Our food was served cold but when we complained, they were very accommodating and replaced our dishes with fresh, hot meals! The manager was also very nice and looked after us well."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, not enough good things to say. The service is great and the selection is almost overwhelming (in a good way). The only reason I didn't give five stars was because my crab cake eggs Benedict has a great deal of shells in it. But I will without a doubt be returning!"}
{"text":"Toast is quickly becoming my go-to brunch place. Solid food, wait is never terribly long, which is a huge plus. Prices are very fair.   If you are trying to have a fancy brunch, maybe consider another place, but for a great brunch to start off the weekend is style, this place is a must."}
{"text":"Great place for a hearty breakfast. My co -worker and I walked in at 7:00 AM and were served by 7:15 AM. Great service and not to mention the coffee was also very good. I enjoyed my omelet and wheat toast very much. The restaurants atmosphere was typical of a small downtown setting but had plenty of room.  I would recommend this place to everyone who wants a great break fast."}
{"text":"I have to say, I don't understand what all the hype is with Famous Toastery!  My partner and I went there for breakfast, and we were happy about the convenient hours as they were open at 8:00 AM on a weekday. It can be hard to find a place for a sit-down breakfast during the week.   When we arrived we were immediately seated and informed that Famous Toastery uses a different service style, which meant that we didn't have one specific server but rather could ask anyone for anything. Since there were only two other tables I didn't really see any impact, positive or negative, of this service style.  I had perused the menu ahead of time for vegan options and saw a tofu omelette. I thought this meant that the tofu would be flattened, stuffed and pressed like an omelette--a vegan breakfast dish I have enjoyed before at other restaurants. But when I asked the server he said that it was indeed an egg omelette with tofu inside. WTF??  Since there were no vegan options, I settled on pancakes. There was nothing memorable about my meal, or my partner's.  Famous Toastery does have a full-bar, and was serving some yummy looking Bloody Marys. We won't be back, but if we did return, it would be for one of them. Otherwise, I'm unimpressed."}
{"text":"The food was good but cold when it came out. The sangria that was so highly recommended tasted more like emergenC with champagne. We also ordered the Mango White Sangria and it tasted like fruit juice sprite, very artificial. This place was a one step above Cracker Barrel. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place! The cornbread with apple butter is a lovely start to the meal. This place is perfect for Sunday brunch with the girls and for a breakfast out with the family. Love it, love it, love it!!"}
{"text":"This place is always a great choice for a quick, but tasty breakfast. The wait staff are always friendly and attentive. I got the SMG omelette with goat cheese and was very pleased!! The portion sizes you really beat!!"}
{"text":"We went for breakfast and it was ok. Not great but just ok. I got the eggs florentine and my husband got a southwest omelette. The price was high for what we got. If I had to choose over eating here or Cracker Barrel, I'd choose CB."}
{"text":"Visited this place a week ago ( Mother's Day). The wait was long but I will say it was worth it. I have been putting off going because I just couldn't wrap my brain around the prices for the offering. I will say that it was well worth it. The service was also fantastic despite a couple issues. I ordered an omelette with spinach, mushrooms, bacon and grilled onions. Well they forgot the spinach. It was still tasty so I didn't bother mentioning. Then realized after I was gone that I never got the toast that came with. Lol. But like I said, I was very satisfied with my food so I guess you can say I overlooked it. I forgot to take pictures so I will have to do that on my next visit #wink. I will be going again."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch spot located in a little niche area near the Hilton lake in the University area in Charlotte.  To start, the service was extremely nice, and yeah, I get that people are nicer in the South, but everyone we spoke with seemed genuinely happy, which isn't always the case.  We sat in the back sun-drenched dining room, overlooking the lake and fountain - didn't even feel like you were in Charlotte.  Their menu is great and you are able to customize items, which is always helpful.  I ordered the breakfast burrito with a side of home fries.  Their home fries are amazing - packed with so much flavor and spice!  The burrito was OK - a bit dry and tasteless, but after adding some hot sauce and black pepper, it was good.  It's definitely filling and a nice portion size.  All of us were impressed with our brunch and left feeling satisfied.  Definitely a busy place that takes care of its customers and I'll definitely come back the next time I'm visiting my buddy in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My first time in NC and first place I try is of course a breakfast place. Everyone is really nice and attentive and food is good. I like the concept of every one is your server so you don't have to wait for one person. I like the ambience and decor. Seems like a place I would frequent if I lived here."}
{"text":"We had to wait about 35 minutes for a table. The food was delicious and everything was cooked perfectly. Service was very attentive, almost too much so. There were about four different people checking on us which was good but I felt a little rushed. Beware for whatever reason this location does not have alcohol which was lame. So don't expect a mimosa. And when I asked about it I felt like the server was kind of snappy. Overall I think next time I'll go to the university location because the food was about the same but the service at the university location is better and you can get a mimosa."}
{"text":"Just had brunch and it was amazing.  Had to wait 35 mins but it was well worth it. I had the crab roll and wife had the Brie BLT and both were outstanding.  The coffee was some of the best around.   Definitely will return."}
{"text":"OMG! Thee best breakfast I've had in a really long time! First off I appreciate how they are able to text you when your table is ready. It was two in my party, we waited about 20 or so minutes which wasn't bad. The food was awesome! I ordered a breakfast with stuffed French toast, bacon and scrambled eggs. After eating hash browns from my cousin's plate I ordered a side of those as well. The bacon, Lord! Cooked to perfection with so much flavor and the right amount on grease on it. The potatoes were to die for!  Eggs were delicious! This was my first time visiting Charlotte and I am very pleased from the food alone, will definitely be back!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food here is always consistent. If you're looking for a solid brunch/lunch spot then this is the best you'll get in the University area. Prices are a little high but they close early so it is justified. Not a fan of the French toast but every omelet I have ordered has been top notch."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time at Toast and I can definitely say I won't be going back.   Here is the lowdown on my thoughts:  Service - 2 stars Bloody Mary - 1 star (mix is awful) Chicken wrap- 4stars.... Lots of chicken in that wrap, had service been better to have sauces - it would have been much better   Others breakfast were rated around 2-3 stars... We were w a group of 6  Wouldn't go back, so many other great places"}
{"text":"Brunch, brunch, brunch. It was a surprise to find a place on a Monday that served breakfast after 1PM (I think we went around 2), but it was MLK Day and it felt like a Sunday to me. So anyway, cute place... we were seated by the window and didn't have a wait. Woohooo! Open space, yet cozy interior. I ordered the Cali Benny- love that hollandaise sauce, even better with avocado- which was delicious. Fresh and not ridiculously filling. I also tried the banana-peanut butter pancakes, which were interesting as well. Toast is a pretty solid spot, so I'll definitely be back.  Oh- and as we left, we asked for a coffee to go- the very nice employee gave us a complimentary cup, so naturally we left him a couple of dollars as a thank-you."}
{"text":"Had some visitors from out of town , figure to take them to have breakfast there. We got there at 11:30 Am (10/11/2016) , it was a full house , the young lady at the front was just standing there doing absolutely nothing, she took a unpleasant look at us and turned her face away , just standing there like a lamp pole , no greetings, as if she was saying \"why are you people here!? \" We did not want to bother , just turn and went to Brickhouse tavern and had a great time.   We traveled from trump national golf club to this place because our club restaurant does not serve breakfast , and we had positive experiences in the past in Famous Tastery . I suggest this girl go find a different job in a different place , ...funeral home comes to mind .... Just remember, No matter how busy a business gets , and how good is the food , nasty attitude can always kill it . It is just a matter of time ."}
{"text":"If I could give more stars I would! I loved everything about this place. I loved the water view. The food is to die for. They serve cornbread with this spread before the meal. It is thick, sweet cornbread. It is so amazing. I had the southwestern omelette. Let me tell you about the POTATOES!!!!! Holy - they were seasoned to the GODS!!! The seasoning and oils on the potatoes are so amazing.   The only bad part about this location is the wait on a Sunday morning. You will wait an hour so just be patient.  The mimosa I had was amazing. My boyfriend had the rumosa and it was yum too! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"As a brunch enthusiast, I take Sundays very seriously. Last Sunday, boyfriend and I went to Toast and it was awesome. We broke the cardinal brunch rule and went right as church got out, but the wait wasn't bad and the patio section is nice and great for people watching.  My dude ordered the corned beef hash and got a side of pancakes and I ordered the potato latkes and sausage. Every server in Toast is \"your server\" so we always had full drinks and everyone was crazy nice. The wait for the food was pretty short, especially since the restaurant was slammed. My potatoes were super cold, and our main server was incredibly sweet and prompt, took care of it immediately and the manager brought me my fresh plate personally and even discounted my bill! It wasn't a huge deal, but they made sure that everything was perfect for us. They take their dining experience seriously, and it shows. The latkes were delicious. They came with creme fraiche and apple sauce and I ate every bite. I also ate all of my boyfriend's pancake while I was waiting on my food. It might have been the best pancake I've ever had. So fluffy and sweet. Toast rules, and it's decently priced."}
{"text":"Charming little breakfast/lunch spot that's sure to please any hungry belly.  Famous Toastery, or Toast as I've always known it, is nestled on the same street as the famous Kindred which means there's no designated parking lot so expect to be driving around on a busy Saturday as I found myself doing last weekend (April 22nd). Thankfully, I didn't have to drive too far as I was able to pull into a spot on a nearby street.  I was meeting my best friend for brunch so I walked in and was told there would be a 5-10 minute wait which it was exactly (less than 10 minutes). I was able to be seated without my friend being there which I appreciated. As I waited, I placed my mimosa order and the waitress brought out waters for the both of us.  The mimosa was mixed perfectly and at a decent price of $5.50 for a deep wine glass portion. I placed my order for the combo consisting of a pancake, 1 egg, and slices (about 3-4) of bacon. My best friend, who's vegan, placed her order for a black bean wrap. The waitress had to ask if the black bean wrap was made with any dairy products and even then she said that she couldn't get a definitive answer. My friend decided to just go ahead and order it.  We both ended up greatly enjoying our meals. I was pleasantly surprised that the bacon was thick cut and not that weak, thin kind that's served at some establishments. My true test when going out for breakfast is the quality of coffee. However, I'd downed a cup before I went to Famous Toastery so I decided to skip out on ordering a cup this go 'round. Service was very quick so if there's a wait, do not be alarmed. You will be seated within a decent amount of time.  I look forward to visiting the other FTs in the area!"}
{"text":"I would not put this franchise on the list of places to accept any sort of wait time before being seated. The food is good, just not worth a wait.   This place has become a new favorite with a couple of coworkers so I've dined with them here for birthday gatherings and I have just not been impressed. They serve breakfast every day until 3 p.m. and lunch. The two times I've been here, I've ordered from the lunch menu. The first time, I ordered the left coast BLT (the addition of avocado makes it left coast) and the last time, I ordered the club sandwich. I chose the breakfast potatoes as the side for both options. Both times, the potatoes had no seasoning at all.   The left coast BLT was good, nothing memorable, and the club sandwich was also good. You get a hearty portion of the club sandwich which makes it worth its almost $12 price. They also have a full bar so you can order a cocktail/wine with your meal during the day.  The waiters are and have been very friendly. They will make any adjustments to meals and work on getting your food out as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute must if you are in search of a brunch spot in Charlotte. I have been here many times and have always either gotten the Cali-benny or the huevos rancheros. THIS PLACE BY FAR HAS THE BEST HUEVOS RANCHEROS AROUND (see picture). No joke, they gave me goosebumps while I was eating they were that good.   They are always pretty busy, but if you can beat the rush (before ~11 am) there is barely a wait. However, if you do get stuck with an ~1 hour wait, there are plenty of stores you can walk in to pass the time (as they take your cell phone and will text you when your table is ready). They also have cornbread in baskets that you can take with you and eat while you wait, which is delicious. When you do get seated, they always have fast service. I had one experience where I ordered a cali-benny and as they were walking out to serve the food, one of the poached eggs fell on the floor and they decided to give me the plate with everything on it (minus one egg) AND THEN BRING ME AN ENTIRE NEW DISH WITH ALL OF THE FIXINGS. I was expecting to just get a tiny plate with one poached egg, but instead, they made the entire dish again and gave it to me free of charge.   The only thing I can negatively say about this place is that I am not a fan of their bloody mary's at all (as I would call myself an avid bloody mary drinker). It is my go-to brunch drink and unfortunately, it is never good when I order it from Toast (which has been at least 5 times as I always hope something magically changed). It is either always too watery, bland, not spicy enough, or too alcoholic (in a bad way). It kind of has that same blandness as if you were to water down Gatorade, you know the flavor of Gatorade is there but its hidden in the background. However, my friends order mimosas and considering Toast makes their own freshly squeezed orange juice (which you are able to watch them do) they absolutely LOVE them.   Therefore, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a new brunch spot and hasn't been! You will NOT be disappointed (unless you get the bloody mary, AKA just get a mimosa)."}
{"text":"I tried Famous Toastery with my husband on a Saturday since a few people we know have eaten there and said it was good. We had breakfast: pancakes, bacon (husband), sausage (myself). It was very ordinary. In fact, I like my husband's home made pancakes better. The staff was pleasant and the place itself was comfortable, but at around $11.00 for a so-so pancake and a side item, I think we will pass on this one going forward. Too many other restaurants with tastier breakfast for a more reasonable price.  Since we only tried breakfast here you might try something different and have a better experience."}
{"text":"Finally! I've been dying for a good breakfast place to make its way to Fort Mill/Tega Cay, and Toast has filled the niche beautifully.   The fella and I ventured in on a Sunday morning at 9:00 a.m., and the joint was jumpin'. We were afraid there'd be a long wait since there were quite a few people siting in the waiting area (which is pretty large), but the bar was almost empty, so we bellied right up. A waitress got us drinks and sweet cornbread with apple butter almost right away.  As their menu says, every server is your server, which can be awesome or awful, and they lean more towards the awesome side. Our service was solid, and the food was good with large portions. It's rare that I can get full off granola/yogurt/berries, but that's exactly what happened this morning. The fella ordered two eggs over-medium, grits, sausage patties, and toast, and he said the eggs were good but not great, but the potatoes - which he got instead of grits - were pretty delicious.  There are still a few kinks to work out - it seemed like there was an army of servers (maybe too many?) this morning, and although the fella ordered grits, he got potatoes and didn't feel like making a fuss about it - but all in all, Toast is a much-needed, delicious option in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great and all. Crab rolls are pretty good. Loaded with shredded lettuce but tasty and served on toasted buttered New England rolls. The Kale and quinoa salad however, while good and hearty, is actually Arugula and quinoa.  The server, while very pleasant was clueless on this and said he would report this to the management. We had no explanation, but two salads were both Arugula.  Service was good, the place is clean. Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, was so busy talking with my girlfriend that I forgot to take pictures of my breakfast but just let me say it was absolutely amazing. Brandon went through various menu choices, different types of cheese,bread, substitute for breakfast sides and how I could have my eggs.  I had 3 egg white omelette with mushrooms onions and goat cheese, and avocado toast!! Yasss!! Will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Enjoyed the food. Menu broad enough to please three teenagers and two alleged grown ups. I have to agree with others that the every server is your server concept falls short. We seemed to get lost a couple times and the timing was awkward. Staff was very friendly but there's no accountability when you don't have a lead.   Weekend lobster specials were tasty and they do a wicked good omelette too! Hopefully they can perfect their service concept or go old school."}
{"text":"We love the famous toastary location in Dilworth. We where so excited to visit the University location. They have the same great menu and delicious food. We came on a Wednesday at 1pm. It was  a little slow. I'm going to give this location another chance. Maybe they are still working out the kinks. Food was good. Portions are not as big as the Dilworth location. Sweet tea wasn't refilled. Restaurant itself is very clean and organized. Server was friendly. She said every ones your server. Which is a odd greeting to me. Any restaurant you go to has this principle. Servers always help one another out."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere to enjoy a Sunday brunch! Wait was not bad they will text you when table is ready. Portion vs price ratio was good. We had fresh orange juice and coffee, banana nut flapjacks and the Mr. Had eggs Benedict with delicious hash browns! Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast spot! Staff is always great and so accommodating to my little one! We have never had a bad meal! Pancakes, eggs, bacon and bottomless coffee!"}
{"text":"I tried the one on Park Road, and though it was early on a Monday, they were out of the hash--their specialty.  So today, Sunday, I tried the one in Ballantyne and they were out of the hash and the  biscuits and gravy and the stuffed french toast.  Really???   I could go back and make the biscuits in a few minutes.    If I had wanted scrambled eggs, which it seems that was all that was in stock, I could have stayed home in my pajamas."}
{"text":"Overall, great brunch spot with LOTS of gluten free options!  A few facts about me... I love brunch... a lot... It's my favorite meal of the day. I just moved to Charlotte and I've been searching for my brunch spot. I've recently adopted a gluten free diet... which sucks because i LOVE things that have gluten... like toast...   Enter Toast of Dilworth... There was a short wait to get a table... We grabbed some coffee from the bar for our wait. The coffee was nice and strong. It was a gorgeous day out so we stood outside and soaked up the sun. We were seated at the bar because we were ok with the first available option. We had three or four different people waiting on us, which was ok with me. I always had a full cup of coffee :) The orange juice was quite tasty.   The spicy scramble was good. A nice blend of flavors with a bit of a kick. I enjoyed my cinnamon raisin gluten free toast. It was nicely toasted and not gross and dense (like a lot of other gluten free breads).   Looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I've waited for a great local breakfast/brunch place to open in this area and this place definitely hits the spot.   The service is great. Whatever you want, they'll try their best to provide.  I've been to 2 of their other locations and the food is always great. Our food met that standard as well.  The reason this location doesn't get five stars is solely because as of today 5/22/16, they do not have their liquor license yet, in result, we could not have a mimosa with our food. Really disappointing since they've been open for months now.  Aside from that this place is A-1"}
{"text":"Went here on my day off. Its a great place to eat breakfast at. There was no wait for our table and the service was really good too. Our meals were good and filling. I had the usual omelet which was great. The restaurant itself was designed really nicely."}
{"text":"A great Southern breakfast spot with quality grits, coffee, and biscuits & gravy. The wait staff was attentive and always on-point. For a couple of DCists searching for Southern comfort food reminders of our upbringing, this was an excellent choice."}
{"text":"First time visit to this place and the food was great! The set up is very nice and the view from the enclosed patio is perfect. We came in and sat ourselves and we were greeted immediately by the staff. The servers were all friendly and not once did we have to ask for a refill. So I would say attention to detail was on point.   Now, on to the food.    I ordered \"The New Yorker\" and probably will be my favorite dish there. Why? I love salmon and the eggs were infused with salmon and onions!!!! The hashbrowns were seasoned perfectly, the cinnamon raisin toast was just right, and the apple cinnamon flapjack ....well let's just say you have to try it. Oh and the orange juice..is freshly squeezed!!  We will be back for sure !! Best breakfast I've had in awhile dining out."}
{"text":"Been to many famous toastery locations, but this was our first time here. I had the stuffed French toast with strawberry cream- it was SO GOOD. It was a big portion, so I only finished like half of it. (Yay for leftovers!!) The French toast was sweet enough, not overly sugar sweet and it was soft & warm! I also had the coffee, it was okay. We came around 10, they weren't super busy. The manager(?) greeted us when we walked in and we were told to choose any table. Our server was nice, although we didn't get any complimentary cornbread? I don't know if they stopped serving that but that was kinda weird lol. Service was kinda slow being that it wasn't busy at all, we waited 15 mins trying to flag down someone for the check."}
{"text":"Food was ok, had the Greek omelette. It had no flavour, but my friend order the corn beef hash Benedict and she said it was very tasty! Service was ok because it was really busy! Lovely location & decor though."}
{"text":"Went to Toast for the first time this morning.  Soooooo glad they have opened, as there are precious few breakfast places in these parts.  The menu is full of variety, so we'll be able to find something new every time!  The pace of the kitchen is good, and we were not waiting too long at all for food.  Presentation was nice.  Everything is freshly made and not processed, but prices are pretty high.  My spinach, mushroom and gruyere quiche (on the special menu) was about $10.  A fair portion with a small bowl of fresh fruit and baby lettuce/tomato wedge garnish, but I was still a little hungry when I was done. My husband's \"Avocado Benedict\" (unusual open-faced whole avocado with cheese, egg and pico di gallo, no bread) was $13+.  The complimentary cornbread with apple spread when we sat down was a nice touch, but in general the entrees are overpriced by $1-2.  I didn't try the coffee.  My husband and brother-in-law said it was 'okay'.  Funny that the most expensive thing on the menu (as we calculated from a food quantity perspective) was the item namesake of this restaurant!  Ha!  A 'side' of toast is one lonely piece of toast and I think costs $1.29 or something like that.  Really?......    The best thing about this place is the true team service.  It's nice to know you can wave down any of the smiling servers and get whatever you need.  Amazing also with this approach that although we felt well cared for we didn't feel smothered.  Good job on this training, Toast!    Ambience isn't bad, a little loud.  This is a family restaurant with apparently no shortage of high chairs.  We definitely hit toddler hour.    I don't know how things go day to day, but I will say this: Get here early.  They go on a wait fairly early and I would suspect are busy all day.  They do not take reservations.  If you do have to wait, though, you can do it in the comfort of a screened porch and the folks at Toast put out a little free coffee to tide you over until you sit down.  So nice!"}
{"text":"Best Brunch and Breakfast in University! I love this place. They have tons of seating: inside with cute decor, a few tables completely outside, and a 3rd area which was the enclosed patio (where we sat yesterday in the perfect weather) with the screened Windows and sunlight, I couldn't be happier. It's a communal serving environment (like Pinky's) where you don't have just one server... It's \"all hands on deck.\" The food taste and quality was very stellar. We both had specials. I had the key lime crêpes and my husband had the crab scramble. Both were large and flavorful portions. I had coffee and he had orange juice (which seemed freshly squeezed but we didn't confirm that). Every meal comes with free cornbread. Only two minor pitfalls: (1) Two bathroom stalls, only (one for each gender) and for its size, I felt there should be more but the restroom was clean and cute. (2) Also, they don't have their liquor license, yet but will serve alcohol as soon as they do."}
{"text":"I will say that this place has their \"restaurant systems\" down pat.  Very quick service and lots of attention if you want it.  Unfortunately, the food was below average, and an order of eggs \"over medium\" was sent out more like \"barely cooked\".  I would have given only one star but the service was truly excellent."}
{"text":"This is my husband and I's favorite place to go for breakfast! If you like them on Facebook they usually put out coupons every month or so for buy one meal get one 1/2 off or 20% of your meal or some other type of coupon and those really make a visit worth it! My husband and I go here for brunch every weekend when we have a coupon and absolutely love sitting outside by the fire. The servers are all so nice and the manager is also a hard worker and very cheerful and kind! My husband usually get the blueberry chocolate chips pancakes and I get the strawberry cream cheese stuffed French toast with bacon and it's to die for! The coffee is also fresh and the waiters are wonderful about making sure you have a full cup. We have never ever had a bad experience and always recommend this restaurant to others! The food portions are wonderful, the service is super quick, and the kind staff always make for an enjoyable experience! I would always choose Famous Toastery over IHOP or Cracker Barrel!"}
{"text":"Such a good breakfast/brunch place! I do prefer the University City location as they're a little more consistent. Everything I have had is very good. French toast, eggs Benedict, omelettes, etc. The cornbread is AMAZING. Great family restaurant, too!"}
{"text":"Came here this past Saturday for brunch with my sister and all her friends after yoga that morning! We had a party of 15!  I called a couple days ahead to let them know we would be coming but they don't do reservations. The guy on the phone was very willing to accommodate us whenever we arrived and said that he would let the staff know we had plans to eat there. When we arrived the restaurant was super busy, like always! They said it would be 15 minutes. We waited probably 10 minutes and our table was ready. Our main waiter was very nice. He got our order and our food out very quickly. We were very well taken care of. My sister and her fiancé have a history with this restaurant. It's her favorite breakfast place and they actually ate here the morning that they got engaged. Here we were again celebrating for her bachelorette weekend. We told our waiter the story and he congratulated her! After everyone was done eating he brought out 3 mini flourless chocolate cakes with whip cream for the whole table to share. It was the sweetest gesture to help us celebrate my sister! Who says you can't have cake for breakfast??"}
{"text":"I would like to address when someone is dining alone the importance of not saying \"Just One\".  Not only did the hostess greet me and say \"just one\"? But then the server said are you waiting for anyone else , or is it \"Just One\"? Leave the \"Just\" remark out--\"One for lunch\"? sounds so much better!!  Also I found it a bit much when at least 4 different servers stopped by to ask \"Is everything okay\"? within 2 minutes of each other."}
{"text":"Update: Been awhile since my last visit. Had a rough morning and decided to stop in for a carryout breakfast. Ordered the two egg meal for myself and the three egg for my husband. Waited 15 minutes. Paid for my order and headed to work. Settled into my desk to eat and see that there were no hash browns. I said I did not want fruits! My husbands order was complete but they now give you a 1/3 cup of hash browns to go. Wth?! I paid full price for two breakfasts and two coffee coming to $25...what a ripoff.   Previous Review: This is a review for carryout. I saw on Yelp a new and hot place near my job. Was craving a hot breakfast and decided to find this place. Unless you are familiar with this area, you may miss it. It is behind the asian restaurant in the inner court.  The door was a bit difficult to open. It was early in the morning so it felt like a ghost town. Someone finally appeared to welcome me. I asked if I can order carryout. He said yes and walked away. I stood there a bit confused and was not sure if I was to follow or wait. He appeared a short moment later and told me to follow him.  He led me to the register and I placed my order and paid. He left again and did not return until he had my order.   I ordered the 2 eggs breakfast. It comes with potatoes and bread. Additional side is $3.69. I added bacon and total came out to $9 and some change.  It was very good. Large cuts of potatoes that were seasoned differently than I am used to. Very flavorful. Eggs were perfectly cooked. Loved I had option of choosing sliced sourdough. The bacon was not as crispy as I prefer, but I will ask it be cooked that way next time.  Despite some uncomfortable moments walking in and waiting in an empty restaurant, I was happy with my order. It really was a good warm breakfast.   The views from all the windows is just so serene. I may have to bring my kids here and enjoy all the Boardwalk has to offer afterwards.  It's a new place and staff, so it may take a while for their service to improve."}
{"text":"Impeccable food and  service. This is my go to brunch spot in Charlotte.  On the menu it tells you every server is your server and that is so true!  The staff is wonderful. I love their specials. They are constantly bringing new seasonal flavors and dishes. I've been to several of their restaurants and they all are equally awesome."}
{"text":"Great menu, make sure to check out the specials! I got the Benedict special with lox and hollaindaise on a toasted English muffin with a side of roasted vegetables. The hash browns are good too (they are really diced potatoes with the most perfect seasoning mix)!"}
{"text":"I've never... NEVER had a breakfast like this before! This food tasted sooooooo good I wanted to cry lol. The service was prompt, the food was exquisite, the staff was polite and we were in and out. Every time I go to Charlotte I will come here to eat because this place right here deserves an award or something!"}
{"text":"I arrived for a breakfast meeting this morning at 7:45 and the first sign should have been the lack of customers at prime hours.  The place was pretty deserted with staff milling about.  I met my colleagues who were already seated and the wait staff was pretty responsive and got me some coffee.  That was the highlight of the morning.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros which took a while and came out cold.  Now, how can a nearly empty restaurant serve cold food?  It's not like the demand was killing the kitchen.  This was not a case of lukewarm food but straight out cold.  The black beans that took up almost 80% of the dish were not warmed at all.  Straight out of the can, plopped onto the plate and out they went.  The replacement dish was better insomuch as it was warm but the issue now was that the dish was so bland and tasteless.  Absolutely no flavor and the beans engulfed everything.  I should have known better than to order this dish.  They avoid a one star because my colleagues food was marginally edible.  First Watch is opening locations in Charlotte so do yourself a favor and wait for them to open one near you.  Forget this place."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this Toast over a dozen times, it is delicious! It's perfect in this great, quiet college town. On a nice day i love sitting at a sidewalk table and enjoying breakfast and coffee while chatting with a friend or by myself. The food is always good. The seasonal pancakes are my favorite...pumpkin pancakes are delicious! The wait staff is friendly and attentive.  I look forward to some of the fall seasonal pancakes soon!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here. I'm usually overwhelmed by the delicious options but always seem to settle on some variation of their stuffed French toast. Their bacon is outstanding too. Nice thick cuts. Speaking of outstanding, their wait staff is on point. You don't seem to get one server, you get a host of them checking in without over doing it. I've never had a cup go dry until I was ready to stop drinking coffee or water. One of my favorite breakfast places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here quite often.  We normally have a group of 8 or more with us each time.  The southern hospitality is in full swing at this location.  The smiling hostesses provide such a warm welcome when we're greater. Servers are very personable, punctual, and attentive to our needs. The food is pretty darn good for a breakfast/ lunch spot.  This is not an IHOP or waffle house like spot!  The selection ranges from pancakes to omelettes for breakfast and fresh salads to wraps for lunch.  The cool thing about this place is you can get breakfast all day.  What really takes the cake is how nice and personable the manager of this location is.  I don't remember my servers name, but Mr. Maust, Brian goes above and beyond to ensure you have been well taken care of.  You can tell where the servers and hostesses get there level of awesomeness from him.  Brian spoke to our table and asked about our experience in more ways than one.  He offered to take a photo of our group with his phone and sent it to me via text message.  Strong Leadership from this guy is the obvious reason for the success of this location and why their employees are so on point!  My family and I will be eating here on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review to commend the staff for being exceptional in their customer service when I arrived with my daughters soccer team and their parents . Our party was large ; 15 adults and 15 hungry soccer players . Like most establishments , seating a large group is challenging during the busy hours of breakfast , especially on a Saturday .   I walked in to the Famous Toastery and met Amanda , who was cheerfully smiling and greeted us . I then proceeded to tell her of our large group and asking her to seat us however she could manage , even dividing up the tables so everyone could just eat before the next game . Not only did she seat the girls at a long table together , she efficiently seated the parents in different groups shortly after . One would assume the wait time easily could have been an hour . Not the case , we were seated in less than 30 minutes . Once seated , the staff approached us to immediately take our order . The food was delicious , the coffee hot and constantly being refilled . The entire experience was outstanding ! Thank you Amanda for taking care of our group , and thank you to the staff who worked hard to serve us! I would come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite breakfast place!! The service is always great and the food is terrific!! Any way you want it you can have it. My favorite are the omelets but there are a vast array of breakfast choices and lunch choices. A perfect go to."}
{"text":"We are a very picky family when it comes to our food.  Toast Cafe was awesome - great sandwiches, salads, and breakfast food.  Potato salad was my favorite, not the typical over dressed goop served in other restaurants.  The place was packed, but the servers were were attentive and hustled!"}
{"text":"This restaurant definitely needs a second visit from me... I cannot say enough great things about the service. On the menu it says, Every Server is Your Server. Totally true. Super nice waitstff, bus staff, hosts ... and everyone is genuinely helpful and never looks put upon if you ask them a question as they walk by your table. We brought all four kiddos to breakfast so I was totally skeptical about the ability to leave unscathed - or at least not have patrons throwing things at us - but really the attentiveness of the waitstaff made this experience seamless.  For food, this is almost a 4 simply because their array of GLUTEN-FREE items is unsurpassed in Charlotte. When I quietly asked about gluten-free options, the waiter rattled off a variety of options with ease. I wanted to cry when they asked if I wanted white or multi-grain toast with my breakfast. Toast is not something I have EVER been offered at a restaurant. Toast has gluten-free pancakes - they were so good that I thought maybe they made a mistake and gave my daughter the regular ones. Nope. They're just legitimately delicious. My other daughter ordered gluten-free French Toast. Yes. French Toast. Gluten-free. Delicious.   As for the rest of the menu ... I ordered the southwest egg scramble off the specials - it was pretty good. What killed it for me was the cold hash browns piled on top. Had I opted to replace the hash browns with a side of fruit, my experience would have been totally different. The hashbrowns were simply large chunks of lightly seasoned potatoes. Even if they were hot, I doubt that I would have liked them. Thankfully, my 7 year old polished off his combo plate and gladly took my hash browns off my hands. Unfortunately, we also ordered a side of hash browns for the girls to share. Also very cold. Kind of a bummer.   At the end of the day, the service was amazing, the food was pretty good, the gluten-free options were astounding, and our bill was $68 ... but only because it was too early for me to order a bloody. We will definitely be back - and hopefully I can give it a fourth star. The place was absolutely hopping so it appears that this place has legions of dedicated fans. I would love to become one of them... I'll try again!"}
{"text":"What an enjoyable breakfast!  Speedy service and such pleasant personnel.  My husband and I stopped by on a Sat. about 7:30am, not crowded, but plenty of people already sipping the good coffee and eating the fresh and varied menu items.  My husband had eggs, bacon, and a large pancake.  The maple syrup was warm in a good-sized carafe.  My eggs Benedict on an avocado was cooked perfectly and came with a tasty pico de gallo and a fresh fruit salad.  Coffee was refilled often.  What else?  Dessert!  A flourless, deep chocolate cake with fresh strawberries and lots of whipped cream.  Perfect to look at and sinfully scrumptious.  The Famous Toastery is clean, has lots of natural light, plus there is some outside seating.  Great experience overall."}
{"text":"A must for brunch near the university. It has a beautiful patio, great service and is inexpencive."}
{"text":"I'm not a breakfast guy, but every time I have guests in town, I drive the twenty minutes to take them here. The cozy Stars Hollow-type feel, the unreal stuffed French toast, the crepes, the everything. It makes me question why I'm not a breakfast guy until about two hours after and I want to take a sugar-induced nap until dinner. Go here! Take your friends! Yell at people on your way in that you're going to Toast! If they look at you funny it's jealousy, pure, lustful jealousy."}
{"text":"Living in northeast Charlotte, this is a nice place to grab brunch without having to travel far for something different. Of course everyone here is your server. The orange juice is fresh made. Each day they have breakfast and lunch specials on an additional menu. I have tried the breakfast special twice and was not disappointed . They also serve every table with fresh cornbread and apple butter.  Complimentary coffee while you wait."}
{"text":"Waiter left without letting us know or giving us a heads up.  They tell you \"any server is your server\" but we end up having to call someone because no one cared to remove the plates from our table or even check on us.  We stood there like four idiots waiting for our server.  After a good 45 mins to an hour, I decided to take action and call a server. He did help us.  I spoke to the manager and she apologized.  She ended up giving us a small discount.. but because of the terrible experience, my family won't be back."}
{"text":"We love to brunch on the weekends and this is one of our favorite places. The staff is wonderful they always look forward to what kinda tee shirt my husband will wear. It feels like family every time we eat there. Also the mimosa are as the kids say on \"fleek\" cause they use freshly squeezed OJ that is everything y'all. If your looking for a brunch spot check this one out."}
{"text":"Recently had breakfast here while I was in town.  Sat outside with our 3 dogs. Had a lovely, hot breakfast in a timely manner. Waiters were friendly and quick to service our table. This was one of the only places where I ordered scrambled eggs that came out light and fluffy like a scrambled egg is supposed to be. No rubbery eggs or bacon here! The french toast was also deliciously sweet and tasted fresh.    If I lived in the area I would go back every weekend!"}
{"text":"Definitely a busy brunch spot. I loved the variety of mimosas they offer. I had the sorbet mimosa which is raspberry flavored, it was slightly sweet with some tartness. I had the southwestern omelet and added spinach to it. I was expecting white American cheese so the yellow American cheese was think and similar to nacho cheese. The cheese over powered the flavor of the other ingredients. The onions were sautéed which was also different from what I expected but not bad. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite! They are seasoned very well. Over all the food was decent but didn't live up to the excitement I had from other reviews. I'm definitely planning to come back and try something different. The French toast looks like a winner!"}
{"text":"Delish!!! The French onion soup is amazing! I also had the crab cakes and they are some of the best. The staff is friendly and really on top of it."}
{"text":"Ordered the sunrise burrito and bit into the top of an avocado (the hard, round part). When I told the server, his response was \"It happens.\" Um, it's not supposed to. I did not finish my burrito because I was so grossed out. I usually love Toast but I'll be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Our first stop in North Carolina and the food was great along with the employees. I tried a crab scramble that was very different but cool. They have fresh squeeze orange juice which I feel is a rarity nowadays. And those grits!!!! Not everyone can make grits but they have it down pat.   The service was stupid quick also which was perfect cause I was starving"}
{"text":"I am a longtime Toast customer & fan. I have spent many a morning waiting for Toast's delicious brunch. Today, I called ahead and was told there would be a 15 minute wait for my 7 person party. When I arrived ten minutes later at 11:00am, I was told there would be a 20-25 minute wait by the hostess with the brown hair in a ponytail. My party checked in multiple times, and almost 60 minutes later we were still not seated. We were told that they had \"paused seating\" because the kitchen was \"backed up.\" WHY they would not seat people waiting in the 85 degree sun (real feel: 94) when there were open tables is beyond me. Toast, until your staff learns to be more apologetic & precise with their time estimates, I am not sure if you are ready to become a national franchise."}
{"text":"Always get great food here and all of the waiters are so nice. I would definitely avoid going on the weekends though. Sunday mornings are absolutely crazy here. The fresh squeezed orange juice is almost worth the chaos though."}
{"text":"First time here and immediately fell in love! The place is bright and cheerful. Lots to look at!  Everyone is your server is a great concept! Helps move things along quickly!  Our food came out fast which was great!  My husband got corned beef hash with 2 poached eggs and a side of biscuits and gravy.  I had a single serving of blueberry stuffed French toast and a side of grits.  I also had a coffee which was surprisingly good! Usually coffee is weak I find at breakfast spots, but it was good!  We were there for a total of an hour. Everyone was friendly!  We will be back! They also have a full bar and serve mimosas and bloody Mary's :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times over the years and always enjoy my meal.  This past Sunday I took my Mom out for lunch at Toast.  We have pleasant memories of eating here with my grandmother.  That was why we chose to eat here this time.  We ordered two meals and shared.  I had the California salad, which we both liked a lot.  There were many delicious toppings such as sweet strawberries, goat cheese, and walnuts.  The chicken on the salad was tasty as well.  I did have to pick out a few wilted, yucky looking greens, but that can happen.  Overall the greens were good.  My Mom ordered the turkey and Brie melt.  She didn't love it, but I did.  We both enjoyed the raspberry vinaigrette that comes with the salad.  We wanted to request some more to use as a dipping sauce for the sandwich, but a server didn't come back to us for a while.  We came during a not too busy time, around 2 on a Sunday.  All of the servers were polite.  I like that they offered drinks to go when we paid.  It's always nice to have another nice experience in an old local favorite."}
{"text":"Went to the farmers market in Davidson. Wife and I decided we wanted a nice sit down breakfast. Toast was in easy walking distance. We were greeted and sat promptly. Our order came out very fast. The wait staff seems to have a great team serving method. I had the Breakfast Benedict and my wife had the waffle with stawberries and side of sausage. Food was excellent!  Restaurant was clean and had a great atmosphere. Cost was on the higher end, compared to a traditional breakfast diner, but what you would expect from the better quality food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I order Benedicts every chance I get! This is the Crab Benedict. It's good, but not the best I've ever tried. We went as a family after church on a Sunday. The overall food experience was decent. Nothing spectacular.  Service was okay, could improve. They charged us for a dish we didn't order. But that can happen anywhere."}
{"text":"Do you like to wait for average food at above average prices? Do you like mediocre at best service? If you answered yes to these, this is your place. I've been to Toast a few times since moving to the area a few months ago. I gave it the benefit of the doubt the first few times because I felt like the long and always incorrect wait time had to be justifiable, but unfortunately for my taste buds, it was subpar each visit. The servers are not assigned to a table which can sound like a great idea but they never know what you're drinking or who ordered what so it becomes somewhat of a ......... (Rhymes with nusterduck). On the positive side, the orange juice is pretty dank."}
{"text":"I ordered here on DoorDash and they forgot my maple syrup for my French toast.  I called the manager at Toast and she was very helpful. They brought me a whole new order with maple syrup!! The burrito was awesome too!"}
{"text":"Not very Famous for quality or value. We frequent the Denver location for breakfast and always have a good experience even when it was slammed back on Father's Day.  Today it was 1:30ish and a very sparse crowd.  Order was misplaced, order was wrong on my wives portion and there must be a bacon shortage as I ordered a bacon/avocado melt which lacked bacon. A patron next to our table ordered a BLT and had to request more bacon as there wasn't much in original order..."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love brunch? I was in town for the University of South Carolina and NC State football game and wanted to grab some early brunch. My brother recommended this spot which is just 5 mins away from his house. The staff was very nice and the place is very inviting. It's in a very busy plaza so parking can be a problem. I really liked the fact that they had turkey meet alternatives being that I'm not eating beef or pork. The flapjacks are huge so please only buy one. They also give you complimentary corn bread with apple jam... it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to come here with the three star rating, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Came here for brunch with some of my old college roommates. We were seated immediately as the place was not packed. The waiters were very friendly and checked up us multiple times throughout our meal. Waters were filled very promptly and the food was very good.  I ended up ordered the turkey burger special with home fries. I was expecting a dry turkey patty but was surprised the patty was cooked just right. The burger was topped with tomato, lettuce, and avocado. The avocado was a smart addition because with turkey being a leaner meat, the avocado's creaminess really helped balance the burger.  Definitely would recommend this place for breakfast or brunch!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Eclectic brunch menu. I've had the bagels & locs on two visits. So Fresh. Good coffee. Everyone at my table was always hapoy and whatever I sampled from their plates was always good. Love that there's a bar for mimosas and bloody Mary's. They also have good margaritas."}
{"text":"Love the Huevos Rancheros! I think the waitress forgot to bring our complimentary cornbread though."}
{"text":"Love this place. We had eaten at several different Famous Toastery's and I was so excites when I found out one was opening in Belmont. It is now our Sunday morning ritual! All the food is great, especially the omelets and egg benedict. You have to try the fresh squeezed OJ."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a good place for breakfast while passing through Charlotte on our way north and found reviews of Famous Toastery to be quite complimentary. We were not disappointed. Fast service and great food coupled with a nice environment made for a well-needed stop on our journey."}
{"text":"Great Service! Awesome brunch, Lobster Egg Benedict out of this world. Definitely will come again next I am in town."}
{"text":"This is a very social restaurant.   People are here for food...good food, but it is a friendly local kind of a space.   Good vibe, If not a bit noisy, but very much a friendly feel.   It seems like sitting at a the bar for breakfast is a cool thing to do if you're a single or small party.   Great menu.  Friendly service.    I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Super cheap compared to Atlanta prices. Ordered three eggs w/ salsa and avocado on the side. The cornbread they give you was pretty good. It comes with an apple butter but the texture is more of an applesauce."}
{"text":"My family and I were in town for a wedding and decided to grab breakfast before we head back to our respective cities. I didn't want the typical franchise places since it was our first time visiting this part of SC so I pulled up my trusty Yelp app and found this place on Yelp. It was about a 12 minute drive from our hotel which was perfect. Unknowingly, Ive eaten here before but at their Charlotte location wasn't too impressed with the food. We came here on a Sunday and the place was packed. The hostess give us a 30-40 minute wait time so we used some of that time to head to the bar for drinks. They have a good selection of house made cocktails; we ordered a round of Rumosas which is a twist on a Mimosa but with mango. Sounds good right? Well, it actually wasn't. It was too bitter for me. I like sweet. After we got our drinks, we had a seat in their waiting area which is by the entrance. It's roomy, maybe about 8-10 seats. After 15 minutes, our names were called. The server was nice and personable. My sister is from Jax and she shared with us that there's a location in the area. For my entree, I ordered the shrimp n grits w/o sausage. Not a pork fan. Our ordered arrived in about 20 or minutes and unfortunately it came with sausage. The manager I'm assuming was making her rounds to each table so coincidentally to she at ours and apologize for the mistake. I received my replacement in about 5-7 minutes. The dish was average; I've had better. My sister ordered the lobster scramble and I could visibly see the lobster pieces. They didn't skim on that. My other sister ordered French Toast and lastly my dad ordered a basic meal of eggs, toast, sausage and turkey bacon. He ate it all. My nephew had pancakes and potatoes. I stole a few from his plate and they were delish. Seasoned well and there was no need for ketchup. I'm giving them a 3 for taste and the mess of up my order."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times mostly for breakfast sometimes for lunch.  The breakfast menu features many choices such as eggs any style , egg specialties such as eggs benedict, breakfast sandwiches , French toast pancakes ,waffles, omelets, corn beef hash , turkey bacon  to name as few. The lunch menu features a variety of salads, sandwiches,  melts, wraps,  burgers , mac and cheese to name a few. The restaurant has a comfortable atmosphere and their motto is \"where every server is your server.\" So one may be served by a variety of waiters or waitresses. The food is plated nicely , average portions, comes out hot. Coffee is very good  and one gets a cup to go if one asks. Everything we had ordered such as eggs, omelets, eggs Benedict,  always fresh and tasty and eggs  cooked to order. Menu a  bit pricey in my opinion but a nice restaurant overall for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"The food is great, but everytime I go here they get my order wrong. I go nearly every weekend and every time they get my food wrong and I end up spending an hour+ there due to having to send it back. Today was so terrible that I likely will not return. My plate was soaked in hollandaise sauce to the point that both my muffin and potatoes were very soggy. There's no way in hell I should've paid for this meal, but I did to not be a complicated customer. Though they bring the ticket with your food, my server brought it out still knowing that it was wrong."}
{"text":"My best friend and I went here on a Sunday morning and were seated within 10 minutes and the place looked pretty darn packed. Service so far had been excellent and then we ordered coffee. Once we had used all our creamers, we just put the empty containers in the bowl they came in to keep them organized. Our waiter (Ryan) apparently did not like that and came back exasperated upon seeing this and just grabbed the bowl and sighed and said \"UGH and about putting your trash in our bowls...\" and he walked away. It was very uncomfortable and rude.   Whatever, I was there to eat! The food was incredible. From the stuffed french toast, eggs, pancake, toast, coffee. Everything. Not a thing that either of us ordered wasn't perfection. It was simply the rude service that was the problem. The rest of the time we were waited on by hit or miss other servers and just stared at by Ryan over the stupid creamer. I think Ryan was just mad about the way his life turned out.   For our gigantic quantity of food the bill was still under $30 and on our way out I let the very helpful and kind manager know about our experience and he assured me he would take care of it and assured me that that was not the atmosphere that they try to cultivate. So we will see. Either way it is totally worth a visit for the food!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon, to celebrate a birthday, as a part of our girls weekend. The wait time for four people was about 30 minutes, which was expected. The staff was extremely friendly and the lake view was amazing. We are ordered mimosas and Bellinis which were strong, but delicious! I was very impressed with quality and freshness of all the food. My meal (southwestern omelet) didn't have enough seasoning to my liking, but the other ladies didn't have the same complaint. The tables were small and became very crowded with the plates added. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"The food here is dependable - I always try to order off of the special menu of the day because the ingredients they use there are unique! The omelets are great, eggs Benedict is always good, especially if they have the smoked salmon version, and the french toast is reliably good.   The coffee is a little bit weak however, and it would be nice if they offered cappuccinos or espresso drinks.   The wait on the weekend is god awful unless you arrive before ten. On Sundays, alcohol isn't served until noon, thanks North Carolina, but if you do go for a later brunch - order the Bloody Mary. I think it's the one of best in Charlotte. Seriously."}
{"text":"Toast is a great restaurant! My breakfast favorite is the Egg & Cheese Sandwich, with 'city ham', American cheese on an English muffin. The portion is very generous.   The Stuffed French Toast is tasty too. You can get a variety of favors. I always order the raspberry stuffing.   For lunch, I get the Ham & Cheese Melt - which is nothing short of awesome. Try it!   Toast will become one of your haunts too. Highly recommended!"}

{"text":"Met some friends for breakfast here.   This is a great local chain that serves really good food.  We have tried this for breakfast as well as lunch and both are really good.    Today I had the omlet with potatoes and a biscuit.  I loaded up the omlet so I didn't need another meat.   Quality of the omlet was very good.  All of the ingredients were cooked well.     Service was very good.  They have a concept that you have multiple servers so you aren't searching for help.   They were attentive but let our party have privacy.     This location has a very warm feeling.  Lots of dark wood and is classy.      Recommend frequenting this business."}
{"text":"Tried this location for the first time.  It is pretty spacious compared to some of the other locations and it is right down from my house.    This was a brunch visit and I opted for lunch.  I tried the California Salad and it was pretty good. Overall plenty of toppings and everything was fresh.    Next time I visit I will try something different"}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in to Toast, you know this is not your typical breakfast place.  It's a step above.  My wife and I went to enjoy a Saturday morning breakfast.  The place was busy, but we didn't have to wait.  I got an omelette with tomato, bacon, and avocado.  It was very good.  The side of grits was good, a little bland (liked most restaurants).  Fixed that with some butter, salt and pepper.  My wife got the corn beef hash with one egg.  It was the highlight of the meal.  The hash wad perfectly seasoned and egg was perfectly cooked.  To top off a great meal, the service was exceptional. Truly.  It's like every server in the building is your server.  Drinks were refilled instantly.  Empty plates were cleared instantly. Checks brought out at they perfect time.  We never waited on a single thing."}
{"text":"Famous Toastery, or as the locals call it, \"Toast\" is a simple breakfast lunch spot with all of the regular dishes. It's a great place to take parents visiting out of town for breakfast. The coffee is very good as well. Prices are a little steep for breakfast food, but sometimes it's worth the convenience. Several locations in our area, and I've found they all have the same great service and menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Famous Toastery location. The inside is warm and inviting, the way a breakfast spot should be. The coffee is awesome and the menu is extensive. This is a great spot for lunch too! Lots of wraps that are very filling."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for breakfast -- we got here at 8am and there was basically no one there!   Menu is pretty standard breakfast fare. I got the blueberry flapjacks which were monstrous and delicious. Also got a side of eggs. Food wasn't too greasy or heavy feeling. The orange juice I ordered was also a monstrous glass, which was awesome. I hate going to breakfast places, order OJ and they give you a tiny glass.  There aren't a ton of options in the area for breakfast so for Davidson, I give Toast 4 stars."}
{"text":"Toast Cafe is my long time favorite. I wish the tables were a bit bigger simply because I am very tall. It's cozy and every meal reminds me of home! Sad that they no longer serve dinner! Highly recommend the Left Coast BLT"}
{"text":"We caught the tail-end of their Sunday brunch. There were a few items that were sold out, but luckily the ones we wanted were still available. I got the egg white burrito with brie, fresh salsa, and avocados. The combo was A+! I asked our waiter to go light on the brie since I'm slightly intolerant to dairy, and my request was well noted. Thanks :) He got the southwest scramble, which was also a hit. And it came with a side of fresh fruit.  Very reasonable price and fresh, delicious food! I wasn't super impressed with the atmosphere, but it was appropriate for a laid-back Sunday brunch. I liked that their brunch cocktails were around $6. I didn't get to partake this time around, but I will definitely be back to try them."}
{"text":"First time at Toast and I will definitely be back.  Got there before church let out and sat out on the patio.  Server was attentive and ready to take our order.  My girl had the corned beef hash and eggs. Excellent hash, homemade goodness.  Every bite I had I kept saying \"that is great hash\". I had the avocado omelette. Bacon, tomatoes, and just a hint of orange. Very tasty.  The sausage gravy was awesome too.  No complaints here.  My girl wants to make it a regular spot.  Jut have to get there early before church lets out on Sunday because like every other good brunch place, this one had quite a wait by the time we were leaving."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and we really enjoyed it. This place is a little different than other restaurants as all the servers are your server. I don't mind that at all since t should imply that you should get better attention, which we received.   Breakfast was delicious! I had the avocado omelet with hash browns and cinnamon raisin toast. It was very tasty. The hash browns though we're more like home fries to me (we're not from around here) and they were quite greasy but delicious nonetheless.   We'll be back to try other goodies."}
{"text":"The system failure and lack of organization skills of the hostess caused us to wait for a table much longer than it should have been. However, the waiting staff were better than I expected after my initial experience at the hostess stand. The food was fine, my Crab Cake Egg Benedict was actually quite enjoyable."}
{"text":"Famous Toastery was one of the first establishments I visited after moving to Charlotte.  I'm a grits fanatic, but the only thing resembling a traditional Southern grit in Hawaii was rice.  They have rice everywhere and look at you dumbfounded when you ask about grits.  \"What's a grit?\"  Now Famous Toastery does understand what a grit is.  They make them not to hot and not to cold.  They're just right.  They even have a fantastic taste that requires very little, if any, additional butter or pepper, let alone cheese.  Grits are not the only southern delicacy in their repetoir. They have a full selection of comfort foods ranging from their Pumpkin Spice Pancakes, which we had in November, to the Greek Omelet with spinich, onion, tomatoes & feta. I had that on Sunday.  I have not ventured much beyond their standard fare.  I've had their toast, some eggs, and a few slices of bacon. We had the hash browns too: although that was more like a roasted potato dish. It was good, but nothing more.  Their eggs Benedict and Florentine are likely part of my future as well as their Buffalo Chicken and Blue Cheese Wrap.  In fact, all of their wraps look and sound delicious.  Although I generally think of this joint as a breakfast stop, their menu is beyond extensive. It's borderline encyclopedic.  From sandwiches and burgers to salads and meatloaf, I think they've covered your pallate.  They even have tofu if you're the sort that prefers to go meatless.  To go orders have been a challenge for me on the occasions I chose not to dine in.   It often takes much longer when you call ahead than waiting to be seated and served.  I live 15 or so minutes away and when I call I'm told it'll take 10 minutes. Unfortunately when I arrive 20 or so minutes later, they are usually still preparing my meal. I've waited as much 15 more minutes at least once after arriving.  That wasn't to my liking. Also things usually get missed on these orders. Didn't get the toast this last go around.  Bummer. Love that toast.  Another challenge with their to go orders is their boxes are paper based. If you're planning to drive somewhere make sure you get there fast. The box falls apart fast: it's like serving steaks on a paper plate in my opinion. I know it's environmentally friendly and all, but by the time I get home the food is just a bit to soggy for my liking.  The omelets are easy to resuscitate on the grill or in the microwave, but potatoes and bread can get messy.  I usually have to put those sorts of things in the toaster oven to drown out the paper taste they absorb.  A good to go box should last at least a half hour in my opinion.    All in all, I give their food a 5. It's great comfort food. They have a lot of choices and I could take all my meals here for a month without trying the same thing twice.  Their service is a 3.  They always seem rushed and that can make for a less enjoyable experience, especially when their is a line of folks waiting to get in.  I'd also say their atmosphere is a solid 4.  It's nice inside and they have a decent waiting area when there's a crowd. They even serve beverages outside while you wait.  If it weren't for the less than stellar to go experiences, I'd rate this place a 4. I think they are a solid 3 for the moment and I'll keep trying them out and update in the future."}
{"text":"Average food at expensive prices. No thank you I will pass. Tried to eat somewhere new and it was a mistake."}
{"text":"Delicious blueberry pancakes, bacon, and breakfast potatoes made with fresh red potato chunks."}
{"text":"I am seriously shocked that this place has a 4 stars.  The food was terrible.  Everything was luke warm at best. The toast wasn't toasted and everything minus the cold scrambled eggs tasted like it came out of a boil bag.  If you want to pay $30 for a breakfast you can get for free at any low level chain hotel, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and I usually enjoy coming here after working a long nightshift as a nurse. Unfortunately, 3 female customers were so loud and obnoxious that I couldn't wait to leave. #RudeObnoxiousWheresMyDuctTape!!"}
{"text":"I love Toast in Davidson so was very excited to hear Toast was opening in my hood, Dilworth. I've tried lunch here about 10 times now and have to say, in my opinion, it is 'just okay'. In particular, I feel the menu revolves around chix ... even in the daily specials, from the soups to the wrap to the salad, it is so often chix.  It would be nice to see some variety in their menu options, perhaps less meat or chix laden. Most of the time the service is pretty good. On our last visit, two waiters tried for my plate before I finished eating, with my fork in hand and one finally got it ;)???"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast or lunch.  A bit pricey for the neighborhood, but nothing out of hand.  Fast, attentive service, and a quick and accurate kitchen.  Fantastic omelettes, great coffee, and I love that they offer a takeout coffee as you leave."}
{"text":"Good food, nice staff, a bit much on the prices though...$4 for a tiny orange juice? Granted it's amazing, but c'mon. $14 for 2 eggs, one avocado, and a few pieces of fruit? C'mon."}
{"text":"Very happening place we love to come for Saturday brunch. Always fast friendly efficient service. Love the lox bagel breakfast.  Meatloaf is yummy, so are the salads. It's a little loud most of the time."}
{"text":"Service is absolutely great! Everyone is very helpful and attempt to your needs. The food was delicious I had the Huevos Rancheros highly recommend them. The best part was The OJ because it was freshly squeezed. I recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Famous Toastery and South Carolina.  Overall this is a great place to eat - the atmosphere is casual and relaxed, the service was really good and the food was even better.  We were met at the door with a greeting and smiles by every server.  I enjoyed my breakfast of a Flapjack combo with a large flapjack with real maple syrup.  If I am in the Charlotte area again, I will make my trip across the state line to visit Famous Toastery."}
{"text":"We go here for breakfast all the time and it is amazing. The breakfast sandwich is huge and the stuffed French toast is delicious. The burger is just okay. It's a typical diner burger."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite restaurant in Davidson... If you are there for breakfast, ask for the meatloaf omelet. It's incredible!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite brunch spot in Charlotte! The cornbread and apple butter are a welcomed starter and they have the best fresh-tasting scrambled eggs.  I have tried the crepes with berries which were great (a special one weekend), as well as a number of egg dishes, and have never been disappointed!  Sometimes there is a wait, but it is never too long and I think definitely worth it."}
{"text":"New breakfast/brunch place in Huntersville. We were desperately needing it! However, the food here deserves only 3 stars as it is nothing really that special. The coffee is absolutely fantastic, and might be the only restaurant in Charlotte that has TRUE REAL COFFEE ! They use Lavazza which is Italian and one of the best coffees in existence.   The food is good, the service could be a bit better. We were not given the corn bread, and the home fries are not good at all. They call it hash browns but they are not even close to be hash browns. The pancakes and french toast are good enough. The Eggs Benedict were okay, not bad but not the best I have ever had. I would still go back for them though. Restaurant X in Davidson has much better ones for a better price."}
{"text":"I was surprised to discover this little gem down the street. We went on a Sunday morning and expected a long wait but we were seated in the patio in less than 20 minutes. The service was good. The food was fast and amazing. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"We come to visit family. We have eaten here twice. The service is excellent. The food is good, it could be a little hotter."}
{"text":"It's hard to mess up breakfast, so we both decided to try toast based on the reviews. Unfortunately Toast didn't live up to our expectations. Seating was a breeze and service was quick. Nice location and clean place. What could have been great was pretty boring. We both noticed the smaller serving of what could best be described as eating at home for us and lack appearance. Except my husband who usually makes breakfast knows how to season the food. His eggs benedict is much better.  With salt and pepper in hand after tasting- I immediately went to work adding flavor to my meal. Everything was pretty bland and lacked any seasoning. Dark dark coffee which we both didn't care for. Expensive too for us we would have paid a lot less elsewhere- Even at our hotel buffet breakfast. Truly sad as they only serve breakfast and lunch- and we had high hopes for this place"}
{"text":"LUV this place.  It is a long wait on Sundays but if you can go any other time, you probably won't have a wait.  Great food.  Haven't had anything there yet that I did not like."}
{"text":"MUSIC - Awesome service and food like always! Only complaint is the change in music. PLEASE go back to a more current upbeat genre to fit the clientele! THANK YOU!!!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting the area and stopped in this little place. Very nice with friendly staff. I had the egg salad with a side of fruit...... A-mazing!"}
{"text":"This is a neat little breakfast place. Service and coffee are good. We came specifically for the gluten free items. We have been twice and they have a hard time with the gluten free pancakes. They need to cook them more because they are so under cooked. However, the grits and eggs are great!"}
{"text":"I loved it. It was my first visit I just felt like going and getting a quick breakfast alone. It was around 10am on a Sunday so they were very busy as expected. Not a problem as I was seated in 10 minutes. Everyone was super friendly and the service was fast even the manager came over and introduced herself. The complimentary fresh corn bread and apple butter was really nice and I'm not even a corn bread fan. I had fresh squeezed orange juice and the lobster scramble with hash browns and wheat toast and cup of fresh coffee... You get a lot of food I couldn't even finish it. Very pleased will definitely go back In the future."}
{"text":"Great experience, compared to the other Toast This is by far the best one , the service was superior & manger was wonderful & on top of that the food was delicious would recommend to any Family & Friends."}
{"text":"I love it here! Delicious food with beautiful scenery! This is a very interesting place because once you walk-in, there's a chalkboard sign that lets you know to seat yourself. When you get to a table, you see a motto on the menu \"every server is your server.\" Really, the service is very quick - get in, seat yourself, order, pay, & you leave."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  We were a party of 6 and they were completely ignoring one individual - forgot to take his order with the rest of us.  Didn't come by to check on us, forgot to bring syrup after asking for it, charging us for Bellinis after telling us they can't serve alcohol until noon on Sundays. They split the bill and double charged several items so we had to go through each receipt to make sure it was all correct - two of the bills were $70+ dollars...seriously folks, do you think 2 people can eat that much for breakfast?!?!  I ordered the Crab Benedict and while I thought it was good (there were crab shell pieces in the crab) it didn't make up for their poor customer service and lack of attention to detail.  The place is cramped and crowded and food is nothing to write home about.    I would steer clear of this place and opt for another brunch spot."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been back several times for breakfast, lunch  and dinner. Frannies is the perfect dessert - a warm mixture of brownie and bake batter withe fudge and ice cream on top. Heaven! The left coast blt is my go to, and the avocado omelet is great as well. I like the burgers, and the house salad is excellent."}
{"text":"Very fantastic breakfast spot! Nice location right by the college, quick seating and service.  The food was delicious and the menu is broad with a variety of good home cooking breakfast menu options (omelettes, pancakes, waffles, etc)."}
{"text":"Amazing food, quick service and the wait was not bad at all. Definitely must visit if you are in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Weekends in the Charlotte locale seem made for leisurely breakfasts, and restaurants open at that time seem to know and exploit this trend.  Toast is no exception and enjoys a current popularity with the age 20-35 crowd that makes this a pre-party and hangover recovery oasis, keeping a full house from opening till lunch time.  The restaurant is big enough to have a large mix of tables and seats at a bar, along with a small patio area outside.  It's a little too big to have that \"homey\" feel but then not large enough to feel like a pancake benefit at the high school gymnasium.  Service is team style as just about anyone could take your order , refill your drinks, and bring your order to the table.  Checks are also payable at both the table or at the bar where the cash register reigns.  These elements create a bit of tension between either considering this a more formal spot for breakfast or a diner where speed is the key.  I'm not sure what Toast is ultimately going for, but moving people through seems to be a priority.  The menu has a mix of omelettes, entrees, and a suprising number of \"eggs benedict dishes\" that are unique.  The Cali Benny with avacado and tomato, for example.  A trio of crepes also looked interesting, but heavy given the fillings.  I also appreciate their options for leaner breakfasts with egg whites, spinich, and turkey.  Again, the menu shows flashes of inspiration and skill, but the pace is that of a quick order grill.  This is not bad, it just feels a bit like an identity crisis.  While most of these more signature meals run in the range of $8-12 (a crab cakes benedict seemed king of price), I was happy and surprised to see that the standard 2 eggs with toast and a side ran just under $5.   The homes fries were a personal disappointment to me as I'm not a fan of fat chunks of potato in the morning, but they were seasoned well and they did seem to be popular.    Certainly Toast is currently a \"see and be seen\" kind of place, but you won't have to stay for long waiting to order and be served.  With the consistency and speed I've seen, they should stay popular for quite a while.  They are open for lunch and have just recently annouced plans to open for dinner, so it will be interesting to see whether this spot remains the \"toast of the town\" after that noon hour."}
{"text":"I have lived within walking distance of this place for months and my first time was just a few weeks ago and I absolutely LOVED it!!!  I went with a friend of mine for brunch and was so happy with the atmosphere, the service, the food, and just my overall experience.  The second time I took some friends of mine for breakfast this past weekend and I was just as pleased.  The corn beef hash is to die for (ask for the country gravy on the side instead of the hollandaise!), the omelettes are wonderful, and their French toast!!!  AH!!!!  Definitely, a great place to start your day :)"}
{"text":"The club BLT is my favorite thing to order. My only complaint is the weird hours they keep. I want food when they are closed!!!!! Great staff all are kind and friendly!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the long wait was not offset by the quality of the food or by the overall experience. Our table was in a high traffic area, the noise level was a din, and sadly, my omelet was overburdened with goat cheese."}
{"text":"Delicious as always. Had the corned beef hash and it was wonderful.  The service is impeccable, super friendly and professional. Love going to Toast whenever I have the opportunity. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"If you love breakfast anytime of the day, this is the place for you. Made to order, wide variety of breakfast favorites and other entrees if you are not breakfast food lover. The wait staff is super friendly and welcoming. I had the mac-n-cheese with side of roasted vegetables and it was so good.  The plates on other tables look so good. Next visit I will have breakfast."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday. It was pretty busy so we had to wait for about 15- 20 minutes. It was so busy that there was no room to wait inside so we had to wait outside the door. This place is pretty cool, they have a half inside/outside area which is nice. The food was pretty good. I got the rasberry walnut flapjacks which were good but they were a little sweet so I couldn't finish it. The hash potatoes were DELICIOUS though. I loved them. They are the cubed style potatoes and they are seasones perfectly. This place is a great breakfast place."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in the area. I can satisfy my appetite no matter what I am in the mood for at the time.   The serve everything & it's all good.  Get there early if you want to go on a Sunday!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here in two weeks. My first experience was not my choice, it was a group lunch. However, I got a standard Chicken Caesar Wrap and fruit and I was definitely pleased.    My second visit, this location was my restaurant of choice. I decided to try breakfast.  French Toast and Bacon. I mean you can't go wrong when bacon is in the equation.  The Cinnamon Raisin French Toast was a treat in itself. Not only could you taste the raisins, but the bread wasn't soggy (which you can easily get with French Toast).  The bacon wasn't greasy or too fatty. You could taste the actual bacon.   Since, I work uptown, this is a great location less than 15 min. to have a quick bite for lunch. I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast place due to the fact that there are delicious gluten free options available for my children who are intolerant to gluten! They have fabulous create your own omelet options as well! Be prepared to wait a bit but it will be well worth it."}
{"text":"Feel the same as most of these reviews. Polite service, but meh food for the price tag. I have gone twice and gotten Togo once and it is missing something...."}
{"text":"I've been here twice . Always a big crowd no matter what time you go. They work really hard to get you seated as soon as possible. I'm not a fan of the coffee to me it tasted burnt , so much that I told my waitress who went ahead and brewed a new pot. Still tasted the same. I'm not a big fan of everyone is your waitress, because as soon as you sit , 5 people will ask if you're ready to order . I also think it's also a bit overpriced as my omelet and coffee were over $15 without tip and to me that's a lot for one person for breakfast."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast choice of toast fresh oj. Little high in price but left satisfied."}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about here. 5 stars because of all the fun cocktails they have. Great brunch place. I've had the breakfast burrito and the avocado Benedict. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food was so so. Wait for table was awful as they mistakenly gave our table to another large group. So I only give it an okay"}
{"text":"DELISH!  The food was great. They have a variety of breakfast and lunch dishes. My husband says the potatoes have crack in them they are so good The service was exceptional!  We will definitely come back and recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I got the apples & cinnamon pancakes, they were so good! The infused the flavor with the mix so I tasted every bite of goodness. I believe the bacon was candies and it was my first time eating it that way. Everything was so good and the service was on point!"}
{"text":"So, we did not have to wait, got there around 12:30pm for late brunch. Please note breakfast options are available all day! Service was good, you are greeted at the door with a basket of cornbread and jam and then taken to your seat. We got eggs, french toast and salmon bagel sandwich. All were good and tasty. Got coffee and grapefruit juice...this was one of the better tasting grapefruit juices I've had in a while. Also, if you get orange juice, it is fresh squeezed! Which is always great! So far one of the better breakfasts/brunch I've had in Charlotte, and good price as well. Your choice of indoor or outdoor seating and any server is your server, which turned out to be very convenient when waiting for service! Most other places are alot of hype and major let down, but I've decided I can come here again, I was that satisfied! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Toast is the equivalent of my Friends Central Perk... it has a comforting atmosphere, reliable food and service, and is a great place to just relax with friends. I prefer this Toast location over others just because of the layout, decor, and proximity to everything in Charlotte.  Atmosphere: Home-y, kitchy, comfortable, albeit a little loud.  Food: Reliable. Always good. I've had everything from the quiche to the breakfast burrito to the french toast. Is it the best thing you've ever tasted? Probably not, but it taste like mom's home cooking, only better! Also, the corn bread and apple preserves they start your meal off with are soooo good! I always want more.  Service: Awesome! All waitstaff serves every table, so if you need anything you don't have to wait for one specific person to come back and check on you.  This place is super popular for Sunday brunch, but surprisingly I don't think I've ever waited more than 30 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"We decided to order take-out this morning from Famous Toastery. The breakfast is a bit more? expensive than Metro Diner across the street but it is a totally different type of breakfast. We ordered a few orders of french toast, eggs, turkey sausage, and chocolate chip pancakes for my younger kids. The pancakes were fantastic! They were light, fluffy, with the? perfect amount of chocolate chips. The french toast was a little dry and ?I wasn't a fan of the syrup because? it tasted like it was infused with cloves. I ordered the raspberry stuffed french toast, unaware that stuffed means two halves of toast slathered with a lot of raspberry preserves in between them. If you're? not a fan of preserves like me, don't order the stuffed french toast. The grits are some of the best grits I've had. We'll be back but next time I'll steer clear of the french toast."}
{"text":"I've yet to be disappointed with the food. The management is responsive. The menu changes with the season. Equally good for breakfast/lunch/bruch. The only reason I don't give it five stars is the crowd; it is jam packed - I'd rather have a liiiitttle more elbow room (most tables are so close you really do bump your neighbor or have to move to let people in/out). I would happily wait an extra 5-10 minutes for a more pleasant dining experience if it means fewer tables. Also, the place is really busy and the staff tends to make you feel rushed b/c you have a server (or two), plus a kid expediting the food and a bus boy all coming/going from your table. I answered \"No, Not Wheelchair Accessible\" b/c I work with a population that requires wheelchairs and I do not see any way to access this place w/out the staff having to move every table and chair to clear a path."}
{"text":"Very expensive for breakfast, lunch and brunch...I probably won't go back unless someone else pays - the food wasn't great...."}
{"text":"On our first time we were expecting a wait, because the parking lot was very full, however we were seated immediately. The atmosphere was very cozy and inviting.  The menu was very traditional breakfast/brunch food. We were given corn bread for the table, which was ok but not my favorite. I ordered the Cali benny and it was very good. The hollandaise sauce was not too rich and paired well with the avocado and tomato. A friend got the avocado omelette which she said was delicious. I will warn that the coffee is very strong so be warned.  Overall I was very satisfied. The service was good and I will be back soon to try more!"}
{"text":"Toastery is cheap and straightforward in its breakfast offerings. I'm a big fan of their hash browns and enjoy that they rotate their specials (when I visited the Dilworth location they had some nice politically themed offerings like the Trumplet and Bernie Scramble). Staff at the Dilworth location, however, leaves a little to be desired. Ordered a mimosa that I never received and the person I was dining with had a leaky water cup that was practically snatched from his hands when he mentioned it. Will probably return to another location instead."}
{"text":"I've been to Toast in Dilworth a dozen times for breakfast and am always impressed. The place is always busy, but the service is speedy. I recommend the southwestern breakfast scramble, PB & Banana stuffed French toast, and their wheat toast, which is fluffy and hearty."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh food! Had soup, quiche and sweet fresh fruit. Lots of selections on the menu too."}
{"text":"My Wife and I frequently enjoy their breakfast. But today we decided to give their lunch menu a try. The patio window area has a wonderful view of the boardwalk. I had the Candied Heat Club sandwich with a Cucumber Salad. The Club sandwich was delicious with moist turkey, Candied bacon with a nice cayenne kick and a smooth avocado aioli to cool off the cayenne. I had a cucumber salad as the side which was way better than expected."}
{"text":"Rising up, back to the streets.....sorry, Survivor got me motivated today.  I live in Indian Land and there is a severe lack of good, modern places to eat breakfast that isn't fast food.  Welcome Famous Toastery!    New strip mall, nice modern design.  Famous Toastery just opened about a week ago and I decided to take my 2 daughters out for breakfast on a Saturday morning.  Walking in you are immediately welcomed by friendly servers telling you to pick your own seat.  Waitress informed me that everyone working there was here to serve so we didn't have a specific server per se which was nice since everyone was 100% helpful.  They kept the drinks full and plates cleared.  The waitress, Linh was helpful and answered all our questions.  The menu has absolutely everything you'd want for breakfast.  As an aside, my daughter has celiac so we're always scared of a menu not having things to suit her.  NOT HERE!!!  Gluten free options are on the menu and she was so happy to be able to order gluten free French toast.  They also had gluten free pancakes which is very nice.  She already asked to go back :-)    I ordered the breakfast burrito which was wonderful and served with homemade salsa which was perfect.  Other places just pour some Old El Paso from \"NEW YORK CITY\" and call it a day.  Not here.  They had a great children's menu which was $4.99 for 3 dollar sized pancakes and a side of fruit.    BTW, they also offer lunch so they have burgers, sandwiches, and lots of salads which is a nice touch for this area.  I'm happy to see Famous Toastery in the area and wish them much success."}
{"text":"This probably the third time I've eaten here. This morning I had 2 eggs over easy, sausage toast and potatoes. The eggs were prepared perfectly and the sausage was seasoned well and tasted good. The potatoes however were very greasy and tasted old. I got the feeling they may have been made yesterday and reheated today. I will however go back to the Toastery again."}
{"text":"basically the place to go when you're too lazy to cook your own eggs but want to feel like you're too good for ihop"}
{"text":"Toast is always a great decision. There food is so good. I've never been dissatisfied with anything I've ordered here. There mimosa are the best. And the staff is super nice."}
{"text":"I met up with Yelp friends old and new here so that we could collectively earn the Breakfast Club badge and we had a great time.  Breakfast was excellent and their policy of \"everyone is your server\" was helpful. There's always a waiter or waitress nearby to refill drinks and clear dirty plates.  They need a way better method for splitting checks. While it was great that they did split our seven breakfasts into six separate checks, it took a little trial and error to get it worked out straight.  I chose the stuffed French toast. A substantial portion (four halves of two slices each) well loaded with smooth peanut butter and sliced bananas. Not too sweet but definitely the lead up to my carb crash nap once I got home. The waitress who brought our food wasn't the same one who prepared it in the kitchen so my \"no powdered sugar\" was missed. Though it did make for a lovely presentation and I knocked it off onto the side plate.  Nice sized restaurant with plenty of space. Outside tables have a good view of the small pond with fountain and paddleboating. Someone brought their dog for the full al fresco experience!"}
{"text":"Came into toast because we heard people rave about the food. It's a phenominal breakfast and lunch place. The stuffed French toast it to die for and great coffee. Be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes for a table, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. Wife got the Cali Benny, eggs Benedict made on Avocado, a great flavor combination. I had the County Benedict, poached eggs on country ham and biscuit with copious amounts of gravy covering it all. And our little one had the kids' French toast with peanut butter and bananas.   None of us finished our plates, so if you're a big eater, this is a great place for you. Also, Bottomless coffee for $2.29 and great coffee inspired specialty drinks."}
{"text":"Worst \"stuffed\" French toast I've ever had. Everything we ordered was mediocre at best. Staff was friendly though."}
{"text":"Checked this place out for breakfast this past weekend. The waiter at first wasnt that friendly but sorta warmed up by the end of the breakfast. Food was good and priced very well. Worth trying if looking for something non chain for breakfast."}
{"text":"Lil pricey but so far I have enjoyed every visit - the quiches are delish as are the wraps- pancakes- and French toast!"}
{"text":"Toast gives me the feels. Always coming in strong with the herb omelettes. Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast and great service! The eggs Benedict where perfect. Great fresh squeezed orange juice."}
{"text":"Stopped here to try Saturday Brunch.  The cornbread/apple butter they give you as a start is sooooo good!  I couldnt get enough of it.  I had the Cali Benny, which was great!  The eggs were cooked perfectly, and they gave you more than enough avocado.  I love a place that doesnt skimp on the avocado.  I got the hashbrowns for a side, they were very tasty and well seasoned.  They are more of a potato hashbrowns.  A friend I was dining with is vegan, and they were very accommodating to her dietary restrictions.  She ordered the Tofu Omelet with no eggs, and she loved it.  Her side of fruit looked very fresh.  Overall a great meal."}
{"text":"Meh...  I've been to the Davidson location a few times and enjoyed my visits. I was in the University area today and decided to check out this location. I arrived on a Tuesday morning and was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait for a table. I was able to seat myself. I was greeted promptly by the server who was pleasant. He took my order and my food came out quickly. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the amount of scrambled egg on my plate. I knew that my meal only came with one egg but this was literally 2 tablespoons worth of an egg. I asked for one additional egg and was charged $2. I seriously doubt that my initial portion was 1 entire egg. The eggs also tasted like powdered eggs. The French toast was bland and none of my food was hot. The syrup had a weird taste to it and they only had 1 option. Overall, I was not impressed with my meal. The servers were nice, however."}
{"text":"I live in Dilworth and finally tried out Toast. The gentleman who greeted us and served us off and on was great. Very professional and efficient. But, that was all that really impressed me. The tables are soooo small and close together. The ladies restroom was in disarray. And the food was just ok. Might as well just have breakfast at home."}
{"text":"First off, they have a full bar and imho that is one of the most important requirements for a weekend breakfast! Great Bloody Mary and yummy mimosa with a generous amount of champagne. It's a huge building with a good size bar for single diners like myself and lots of patio tables for sunny days. I had the country Benedict and the biscuit was nice and soft even though I came a bit late for brunch (1p) the country ham on it was a bit salty but I always forget that is the nature of \"country ham\". Service was fantastic and even though everything came out quite fast it was hot and fresh and definitely hadn't been just sitting in the window waiting for me! Did I mention they have a full bar?! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Kids vote- 6 stars- \"because of mac and cheese\"                    5 stars- \"I love the pancakes and eggs\"  The Toastery really cares about make it right and providing us with quick service, clean restaurant, and fresh tasty food.   Warning you will have to wait for tables even if they are empty, but enjoy some of the complementary coffee and hang out for a bit while they do their thing. This wait was easier once I knew what to expect.   This is our second review; because our first was not the best, so the owner reached out and asked for us to try it again.  He gave us compensation and some incentive.   The food:  Ruben with chips- \"good, nice, and sloppy! plenty of everything. The chips are chips. \" Kids Pancakes with eggs, cup of fruit- \"good, it was fine. Gave me too much. They gave me syrup; because they did not have Nutella \" Mac and cheese-  \" delicious, but I had to wait for a spoon\" Runners omelette- I am glad I got it. Not a huge fan of the turkey meat inside. I really enjoyed the vegetables. I loved how crispy the cabbage was and it was tasty in the omelette. I would order it again and next time just ask for double Brie and hold the turkey.   The food came out super QUICK! We did have to ask and waiter for silverware to eat it and again our server was hard to gain their attention."}
{"text":"Flapjacks are good. Banana nut Flapjacks from Famous Toastery are great. Famous Toastery makes them fluffy yet delicious and sticky and with a sweet and rich distinctly banana nut taste.   Three and Half Yelps."}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast to-go (definitely call it in ahead of time if this is your plan - I regret not calling!). Ordered bacon, (fried) egg, and cheese (Gruyere) on a biscuit with a side of breakfast potatoes. Bacon was good, egg was cooked perfectly, biscuit was just okay - not flaky by any means...more of a soft croissant than a biscuit. The potatoes didn't have much flavor and were also very soft. Was hoping for more of a crispy home fry style potato.  Not a bad meal in any sense, but not a home run for me. I will say they have a great selection of cheeses to choose from when adding to a breakfast sandwich!  Interior is CUTE! Loved the style of the restaurant and decor.  Disclaimer: I was in the area for work and found this place on Yelp. If I am ever back in this area, I don't know that this restaurant would be my first choice."}
{"text":"If you like consuming your sodium intake for the day try the Blackened chicken Caesar wrap. Holy cow. That was the saltiest wrap I've ever eaten in my entire life. Lucky for me I would easily be distracted from the saltiness of the wrap by the hair that was wrapped up in my chips. I hadn't even finished half of the wrap before it was taken back and being re-made due to the hair. I was hoping my next plate would come without hair and less salty, unfortunately for me the wrap was still just as salty. At least I didn't have a hair in my food this time. However I will not be back to this location. Famous Toastery is delicious, at least at every other location I have visited."}
{"text":"Small town....small space....now for a lot of places this would be a bad thing, but great things can come in small packages....I should know.  Sitting among the little shops and coffee shops and ice cream parlors sits Toast.  The name is as cool as the place/food/servers.  Can it get packed on the weekend...yes, but just go early and miss the crowds.  If you go in the summer, the Farmers Market happens just down the street and makes for a perfect Saturday morning.  eggs are great, the pancakes better, and the coffee always hot and tasty."}
{"text":"I liked this place until I found out from our waiter that the biscuits come in frozen and most items are not prepared fresh. That was disappointing to hear. Haven't been back much since. In a nice area like Davidson, you'd think fresh, homemade food would be required by the clientele. Maybe they'll step it up cause it's a cute area of town??"}
{"text":"The food and service were both excellent! I had the western omelet made the way I like - no bell pepper and with goat cheese - outstanding! My husband and I loved it and will be going back."}
{"text":"I got the country Benedict but I switched out the ham with sausage. It was absolutely amazing. I will come back just for that.    The rest of what we got was just okay. The home fries look like they are seasoned well but labeled any flavor. The stuffed french toast sounded better than it was. We got the peanut butter and banana. The peanut butter over powered the French toast so much that it tasted more like a peanut butter and banana sandwich with maple syrup."}
{"text":"Quickly greeted and seated. Service there was great. Music and atmosphere was nice. I had the lobster Mac n cheese and it was delicious. Would definitely recommend this place and look forward to another trip for brunch and mimosas."}
{"text":"Not a happy hangover....  Ordered through door dash. The menu said 'corned beef hash, potatoes, eggs your way. I was really looking forward to potatoes and didn't get any. Except for a tiny bit of minced potatoes in the hash.   Eggs were wayyy over cooked. I understand it's hard to have great breakfast delivery but the eggs were long gone before they left the restaurant.  Will not be ordering from here or going here again."}
{"text":"Hands down fabulous every single time.  LOVE this place.  I take everyone who comes to town, or comes to church with me, or just wants breakfast or brunch with me HERE.  I found this place the first weekend of August and had visited there 6 times by the end of September. Everything I've had is good, and so has been everything anyone else I know ate.  Cinnamon raisin french toast, raspberry walnut pancakes, corned beef hash, omeletes (the Runner, with egg whites, turkey, grilled veggies and brie is my favorite), and they also serve lunch items.  The service is great.  Indoor and outdoor seating.  Coffee is good, even without cream and sugar.  And, to boot, the prices are incredibly reasonable.  You can't go wrong. Awesome, awesome, awesome.  A must visit when in the area."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this, and highly recommended. We had breakfast there one morning, and it really was an excellent breakfast"}
{"text":"Toast was good, for sure, but im not really sure what all the fuss was about. And by fuss, i mean 30-60 minute long wait for brunch and jam packed tables. This place is so busy and while it was decent brakfast food, nothing really stood out to me.   I had the Cali- Benny which is a modified egg benedict with avocado and tomato instead of canadian bacon. The combination was great, but the hollindaise sauce lacked some flavor and the eggs had a strong vinegar taste. Im guessing they use too much while poaching. Although, they do ask you exactly how you want your eggs poached ( yellow runny, white hard, white runny, etc) and mine came out spot on. They do serve complimentary cornbread when you sit down, but it wasnt great. Overall i dont really have any major complaints, but thought it was kind of a standard breakfast place."}
{"text":"Great place excellent service. The food is delicious and fresh. They have good menu options for breakfast and lunch. I just wish they stayed open later. Oh yeah and the mimosas are yummy."}
{"text":"Toast redeemed themselves at this location. The Toast located in Ballantyne was awful.  This time, it was one of the best breakfast I've had in Charlotte so far! The coffee didn't taste burnt, it was creamy and fresh!   I ordered the Western omelet without ham, wheat toast, and a side of fruit. Not kidding, the meal came out within ten minutes. I couldn't believe how fast it was and everything tasted incredible! The fruit was fresh, the eggs were cooked to perfection and the toast...well they surely live up to their name. Great job, Toast!  We sat on the back porch and the waitstaff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for breakfast and thought it was pretty good. On St. Patrick's day I was in the area and decided to try their dinner service. I was greeted with that small town ambiance that I was seeking. My server was excellent, despite the fact that I came in around close time (sorry!) I tried the chef's special risotto, something outside my comfort zone and it was AMAZING. it had small chunks of potato and a perfectly breaded chicken breast. Just awesome. I also tried the Irish Car Bomb Mousse and it definitely exceeded my expectations. just enough chocolate, not an overpowering alcohol taste. I had heard from a few regulars that they had recently switched chef's and I have to say from what I experienced he is rocking it! I will DEFINITELY be back for their dinner service again!!"}
{"text":"This is a cute breakfast place located in Charlotte! Thus is a busy restaurant so the wait can be a tad long. However,  my friends and I found seats at the bar... And still waited for a while to be served... lol.  However,  my food and drinks didn't disappoint! I had a Chorizo scrabble with jalapenos,  tomato,  onions and corn with grits and toast. I also had the Jack Daniels Peach bellini, it was delish! My friends order hot chocolate and the orange cream mimosa! They loved their choices too! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Came here this morning and it was phenomenal! The food and the service was great! The location is perfect for a great bite to eat, followed by a nice walk around the boardwalk. The staff work together to make sure you have a wonderful experience while you are dining. I definitely recommend this establishment if you are in the University area!"}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews but this place was terrible. Not sure how you can mess up breakfast. Bringing eggs out cold twice is not normal. Service was terrible. Their motto is where everyone is your server and they still have poor service. Don't say it but do it. 25% off on an uneaten meal.   Hmmmmm"}
{"text":"Who cares about the toast, this place has great food!  When I walked in I was greeted by a very friendly waiter. He let me choose my seat and since it was my first time he gave me a quick rundown of how the business works. Everyone is your waiter and everyone will check on you as they walk by. Here everything is made fresh that day. There is no left over cooked food that is used the next day. They also don't own any fryers so you won't be finding any run of the mill greasy breakfasts here. I had the corn beef hash, which comes with two eggs to order on top of it. I have to say, it was one best corn beef hash breakfasts I've had in a long time, it was so good. My waiter even took the time to tell me how runny each type of cooked egg would be on my hash (i.e. over easy would be white and yellow runny versus over medium which would be just yellow runny, etc). A nice bonus was that the coffee here was excellent and they offered a to-go coffee as I was leaving. I didn't try it this time, but my waiter also directed my attention to their orange juice machine. When you order some OJ, they take actual oranges and they are freshly squeezed for your individual glass right in front of your eyes; it's definitely a must try for the next time and there will be a next time. Thank you Famous Toastery!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to go have breakfast with my husband so I looked on Yelp and found out about this place. It's close to where I live so I thought, why not. It was busy and had about a 25 min wait but no big deal, that's not unusual. I didn't care for the location of the table because it was near the bottom of the steps coming from the entrance/waiting area so it was a lot of traffic and it was VERY close to another table. I ordered the cinnamon raisin French toast with a scrambled egg and turkey sausage. My husband had an omelette (western style I think) and potatoes. My food was just ok, nothing special. The French toast tasted like it was made with regular supermarket bought cinnamon raisin bread and the sausage also tasted like average store bought sausage. Just like the Walmart Great Value brand that I buy sometimes. My husband said his omelette was good. I tasted his potatoes and they were so good, seasoned to perfection. He thought so too. Before your meal you get complimentary corn bread and what I believe to be apple butter. I like my cornbread sweet and theirs wasn't so I didn't like it much. The prices were reasonable and you have more than one server which is a pretty good idea. I would go back and try an omelette with potatoes so overall, not a bad place."}
{"text":"Took my friend to my ultimate fav for breakfast! I think he loves this place now as much as I do :) Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"This place is really a step above IHOP; I didn't really like it.  Their staff setup is that you don't have a dedicated waiter but anyone can wait on you--that led to some confusion to be quite honest.  The food was just okay--nothing special although their macaroni and cheese was really good.  I wouldn't go back but I also wouldn't tell anyone not to.  It was just...okay."}
{"text":"Now the town of Davidson is filled with some of the most 'walking, running, jogging, skate boarding, skipping, dog escorting, hopscotching, , rollerblading, bike riding, ....people I've ever come across!!! LOL. But indeed it's a lovely lovely quaint town. Ive heard about this place called Toast, and I pass it on my drive to work, but never had the time to visit. So last night I decided to give it a try. Absolutely Marvelous! The host was great, the food exceptional, and the dessert was scrumptious. I agree, this place is worth visiting if you happen to be in the Davidson area. Also, I am told there will be a Toast opening in the Charlotte/Dilworth area later this summer!! So be on the lookout for it..."}
{"text":"I love toast!!! the only reason I am giving it 4 out of 5 is it just is so jammed packed in that little tiny space they have.  The food is awesome but I always feel like I am eating on someone else's lap! great place though for any meal"}
{"text":"I wanted something \"different\" for breakfast this morning & I got it! I had a breakfast burrito with egg whites, brie, avocado & salsa! So delicious & fresh. They have all the traditional options as well. My hubby had eggs, grits & bacon. My son had the French toast. The French toast had great flavor & was cooked perfect.   The service was fast. We had our meal fast & everyone was super friendly. We usually go to Stacks & Big View for breakfast on the weekends & this might just be my new favorite. Famous Toastery will definitely be on my places to frequent.   Fyi..... it's separate owners from the location in Ballantyne. Each location is independent."}
{"text":"First off I will give the staff the credit they deserve! Everyone was polite and attentive. However, the downsides are they don't take reservations so you have to plan accordingly. They offer a side with your breakfast so I got the hash browns - which are actually home fries. Tasty but not what I was expecting. My sister got the pancakes which tasted more like raw flour than chocolate chips. There was a large line forming out the door so you felt rushed to leave instead of staying even an extra 5 minutes to wrap up and chat. As well as the price of the menu. $86 (prior to tip) for 6 people to have breakfast - without alcohol or add ons seems a little too steep for me!"}
{"text":"The fact that my omelette was served in (and I'm not exaggerating) a 1/2 inch of orange grease (\"it's because of the potatoes\", the server said) was not even the main problem. The main problem was how it was handled...an eye roll from the server when I asked for it to be sent back, the fact that we never saw her (or any other server) again, and to top it off, the snotty attitude from the manager, who made a terrible attempt at apologizing for the mishap. No one ever came back, even when it was time to pay our check! I had to wonder through the restaurant looking for someone to take our payment after we got tired of waiting. Beyond disappointing, especially since we love the Cary, NC (where we live) location so much and have had such positive experiences there. There is an IHOP about a mile from this location - next time we're in town visiting our son at UNC-Charlotte, that's where we'll go...you should, too."}
{"text":"Amazing food and waitstaff. Recommend 100%. General Manager was friendly and truly cared about her job. Waitstaff works as a team."}
{"text":"We enjoy the urban feel of this little restaurant in quaint downtown Davidson, NC. The best breakfast in the area, plus the staff is the friendliest and entertaining. Chris, our favorite waiter,  is a stand up comedian, keeps us laughing. Mat gives a show when he sets up the table. Great dining experience."}
{"text":"I thought it was odd we received the check the same time we got the food, since we wanted to order drinks after we got food. However, the food, customer service, and atmosphere was worth trying."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! Service was left to be desired. I sat at the bar as I was by myself. Their policy is \"everyone is your server\" and that seems like a great idea until you are asked three times for your order to be taken when you had already ordered but was awaiting coffee. Also, alcohol isn't served until noon, yet the drink menu is placed in front of you at 9:30a - pretty big disappointment when you are from out of state. Otherwise, great food, decent service for a busy Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait, especially if you want to sit outside. We received our food, before our drinks. Seemed crazy but to be expected on a gorgeous Saturday brunch time.   The food is good, it's not a quick in and out breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Love the idea that everyone is your server! Food is always good and decent portions. Great sides, bonus they have turkey bacon! I do not eat pork so I get excited for restaurants that think of us non-pork eaters for breakfast options.   Decently priced for all meals! Will be back and thankfully there's always one close by!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've ever had! I would highly recommend to anyone! I had the lobster Benedict and it was one of kind!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Famous Toastery. This place really has potential. I'm really hoping it works because the University area really needs more restaurant options. We arrived right at lunch time. The staff was polite. The gentleman that greeted us explained how the service would go. You'd have a team of waiters instead of one dedicated person assisting you.  They told us to sit wherever we wanted. We chose by the window that had a view of the pond. I ordered the New  Yorker and a flapjack. The New Yorker is basically a smoked salmon egg scramble. The flavor was good but the texture was off as it was a little on the dry side. The flapjack was very good. Great texture and tasty. The syrup is fabulous. My wife had the corned beef hash with hollandaise sauce. It was really good. However, nothing comes with it but two eggs. No toast, no other side. I would have expected more for $11. Also, they drowned it in hollandaise sauce. I think we agreed that this place has potential and that we'd try it again. Although we do feel that it's a little bit pricey for what you get. But next time we'll pick other options to validate that."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!! Exceeded my expectations.  I thought this place would be your run of the mill IHOP type. I ordered eggs, sausage, potatoes, and a pancake. The food was SO fresh and tasty. Not too much grease or oil. The eggs are perfectly cooked, sausage was very tasty, and potatoes were delicious. I cannot overstate how fresh it was.  The cafe was very busy for a Sunday brunch, but we were seated in less than 20 minutes and wait staff was very attentive. Food came out quickly, too.   My fav brunch place in Huntersville to date. Definitely over Cafe 100."}
{"text":"Such an adorable little brunch hot spot! Expect to wait, but the wait is worth it. I really enjoyed the fact that all waiters are your waiter, so you do receive excellent service since you aren't simply waiting on one individual.   I visited on New Years Eve, therefore it was busy of course, but the food was phenomenal! Brunch is my favorite meal, so I'm glad I went out with a bang in 2015.   If you're deciding between the Charlotte and Davidson locations, come to Davison. If you're deciding between the French toast or your low carb diet, GO WITH THE FRENCH TOAST. Any flavor, do it.   Also +1 for mimosas and cool local art decor."}
{"text":"my favorite breakfast spot! They have a wonderful specials menu, which we always order from, with fancy French toast offerings, and crepes of the day. The omelet menu is extensive. service is always pleasant and quick. the corn beef hash is amazing, we get it as a side dish every time we go. This is always our go to breakfast restaurant, we haven't found anywhere else that even comes close!fresh delicious food, every time!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Davidson is a very nice, quaint and friendly town. Very family oriented and great local community.  Place can get pretty busy and tight, especially on weekends so expect a delay if going on Saturday or Sunday brunch.  Otherwise, food is great. Never disappointed. Even give you coffee while you wait. Would definitely recommend if in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast/brunch spot! I love the \"every server is your server\" concept.  I had the western omelette with cheese grits, smoked sausage & English muffin- all was delish. My sister had the blueberrie/cream cheese stuffed french toast with crispy bacon & she was impressed. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere  Was there Tuesday one week after they opened around 11:30, it was nice, had the crab benedict, my friend had the SMG omelet, a lot of food.   The screened-in porch is  a very nice to sit with the ceiling fans.  The food was very good, glad they finally got opened, other things there I want to try..."}
{"text":"I've been there twice and had the runners omelette without cheese, crispy potatoes and the cinnamon raisin toast. The coffee is on point."}
{"text":"I was not impressed.  The english muffin on my eggs benedict was  hard as a rock-I couldn't even cut it with my knife. The ham they used was of poor quality, very chewy and had a lot of gristle. My husband's eggs in his New Yorker were watery, and his toast came out with no butter on it & it was burnt.  Although our service was reasonable (she came to take our order in a reasonable amount of time)-she never refilled my coffee, and did not refill my husbands water once. For this place getting 4.5 out of 5 stars, we were quite let down. And for us paying $30 for just two of us to eat brunch, it was not a good deal for our $$."}
{"text":"This was the first time I tried Famous Toestery. We went there on a Saturday morning for brunch and we really didn't want to wait for 25 min so we sat at the bar.  My friend ordered Huevos Rancheros and I ordered Sunrise Burrito with a side of flapjack.  My friend really enjoyed her Huevos Rancheros but I had higher hopes for my burrito but I liked my flapjack (pancake). Food came pretty quickly. Overall, I will come back to try more of their selection for brunch."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place because the food is great, the coffee is great, and the customer service can't be beat. The prices are a little high for a typical breakfast joint, but the quality and service are definitely superior to most places.   My only gripe is that the four top tables are too small. I have a family of four and we have to find places to stash the ketchup, butter, creamer, sugar, salt, pepper, etc before our food comes because there simply is not enough room for everything to fit. They were really meant for two people. Please get larger four tops."}
{"text":"Expect a long wait on a Sunday morning but the food is well worth it. Give your name to the hostess and grab a specialty coffee or bloody Mary at the bar while you wait. Download The List app to see your spot in line as well as the progress you make. Once your table is ready, you will be greated by a friendly server who will inform you that \"every sever is your server\" so you can ask for help from anyone in the wait staff.  To start, my friend and I ordered the classic Bloody Mary ($6.50) which was turned around quickly and was refreshing. They did a nice balance of seasoning without overdoing it -- I hate it when I take a sip of a bloody and all I get is pepper. Not the case here!   I ordered the Crabcake benedict ($13.99) which is only available on weekends. In short, it was amazing. Stuffed with real crab, hollandaise, poached eggs, and your choice of side. I chose the Hash Browns which were delicious and well seasoned.  Highly recommend for your next Sunday breakfast adventure!"}
{"text":"I thought that this restaurant wasn't going to be anything special since there are so many brunch places now. But downtown Davidson and its little charm plus the delicious food here blew my mind. They make their pancakes fresh every day. We had a raspberry walnut pancake on our walking tour and it was so good! I'm usually not a big fan of pancakes but these were so fresh and had chunks of walnuts in them. The honey cured bacon was a close second - couldn't get enough of it!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal place to eat. They didn't have blueberry pancakes on the menu but they made me some anyway and it was phenomenal. I had no idea it wasn't on the menu. My wife gently pointed out that they went out of their way and I in my male ignorance had no idea. Thank you so much for your service and kindness. I'll be back many times over"}
{"text":"Always love the feel in the place. I've had some great memories with my wife here. The food has always been good and the service even better. Thank you so much:) I appreciate what you do."}
{"text":"Food - 5 stars.  Service - 2.5-3 stars.  Me and my wife come here very often, great food and usually great service at this location. For a restaurant as busy as Toast and with a 40-45 minute wait, it blew our mind to see almost 10 empty tables and 7-8 waiters/waitresses just standing around in the dining room with nothing to do. Our waitress never brought us corn bread, or even came back to check on us the entire time. We had to flag down other waiters to get refills and condiments. It seems this place has a lot of work to do with their systems."}
{"text":"We come here a lot and recently it's been great! But today, waitress had no sense of urgency or humor and seemed like she had an attitude towards us.  I asked for more cream for my coffee and never got it. We only saw her when we placed our order and never again. Also never got the cornbread when we sat down that you always get. No way that omelet was worth $12.99 either.  Definitely not going to come back here for a while."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great atmosphere. Great value for the money and quality of food. I got the combo from the off the griddle menu. $10.99 def worth every penny. Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. Definitely visit this place again when we are back in the Charlotte, NC area."}
{"text":"Really great place! Delicious classics, and some of their own, served by very competent staff quickly.  Love the sound of the screened porch doors opening and closing and the feel of the place; very homey. Gets crowded, but they always find room without too much of a wait. They even have a coffee station to help ease the pain of the wait. Very customer friendly!"}
{"text":"I was fired famous toastery downtown Greenville sc on main st  for reporting out dated food be careful if you eat there i attached pictures of the out dated food that they are serving you i contacted the owner by txt and she hasn't contacted me back i don't think she cares it all about the moneyv"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!! My wife and I took our kids for breakfast. We ate all of our breakfast before her food ever came out. Coffee cup sat empty most of the time. Saw our server once. They brought someone else's food to our table and then someone else's credit card. We told them to keep my wife's breakfast and take it off the bill. Hardly an apology when they dropped the check which was $60 for 3 of us. Save your money and do NOT go here."}
{"text":"Good bfast choice. Was $67 for 4 adults and a kids meal. We got the shrimp and grits, omelettes, pancakes and favorite hash. All large portions and all was very good even the coffee, which is often not the case with these diner type restaurants. Not the best food I ever had, nothing mind blowing but all good. Definitely a solid option, we came around 9am on Saturday morning they were pretty busy but no wait and we were seated outside right away."}
{"text":"Famous Toastery in Belmont, NC serves up tasty food in a prompt manner, but is a little bit expensive for what you get.  We stopped in early on a Sunday afternoon, after the church-crowd rush had dissipated.  Seated promptly, our server offered us what was essentially an amuse-bouche of delicious, moist cornbread.  We were really hungry so it was nice to have a little treat before we put in our orders.  I got corned beef hash with my eggs over easy, and biscuit on the side.  The hash was well-seasoned and perfectly cooked with a great crust, and my eggs were ever so slightly overcooked but still runny for the most part.  They also covered the eggs on top with hollandaise, which while not traditional for corned beef hash, worked pretty well with the dish.  It served as basically more egg yolk to mix into my hash, which I'll never argue with.  The biscuit that came on the side was a savory Bojangles-style rather than a sweet Flying Biscuit type, but it desperately needed some salt.  I won't hold it up against a Bojangles biscuit which are salty as hell, but the dough definitely needed a little improvement in the seasoning department.  I only used it to sop up the yolk and hollandaise from my main dish, so it did that job just fine.  My wife got a turkey reuben with sauerkraut and cucumber salad on the side.  She enjoyed it quite a lot and her only comment was that she wished the reuben had a little bit more spread on it.  Service was prompt and friendly, so my only quibble was with the pricing.  The corned beef hash didn't come with toast or anything, so I'd say to either increase the portion size by adding toast or more hash, or decrease the price by a buck.  You want to walk out of an afternoon hangover-cure brunch with a full belly, and I definitely could have put more away but didn't feel like ordering or waiting for anything else.  Since it's right down the road from us we'll definitely be back, as there aren't a huge number of local places that are open on Sundays.  I look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Amazing food & Service! We all got the strawberry & cream cheese stuffed French toast!! Also the orange juice is amazing & fresh!"}
{"text":"Toast is toast.  We arrived very excited about a new breakfast place. I love breakfast! We left feeling foolish for spending money there.  The good: This is family friendly. I don't have children- but it is the sort of place that I could take my nephews to. The service was quick. We were seated quickly. It is large. The windows allow a delightful amount of real sunlgiht. It is pretty inside.  The bad: The food is average at best. You can easily go to a number of other breakfast hot spots in Charlotte and spend the same amount of money for something far superior. It is also very loud inside.  The ugly: EGGSHELLS IN OUR EGGS BENEDICT. Don't get me wrong- I know it can happen. We received the food so quickly- perhaps they just need to slow down a bit? My big issue wasn't the eggshell. It was the reaction to the eggshell. The server looked at us blankly and a little confused. I'm unsure if she knew what to do. They decided to comp our JUICES.  1. The manager never came by. It was obvious that the server asked someone about what she should do because she came back with saying that they will comp our juice. Ummm....isn't it the managers job to come by and check?   2. Comp the JUICES. Not the item that had the eggshells in it. That is just cheap. Maybe it is cheap that it irritated me. But really? The juices? (FYI- the \"large\" juice is rather small)  3. We had that weird feeling that if we argued our case- they would have comped the dish with eggshells in it. I hate that though. I believe in costumer service- not haggling. I just won't come back. I would have considered giving it another try if they had responded better (I am a sucker and will usually give a local place a few shots before crossing it off the list completely)  This place is all quantity- not quality.   The server did suggest giving us another crab cake benedict or another item. That is lovely and all..but really? When you are chewing eggshells you lose your interest in eating.  I couldn't even touch the grits. I am not a Southern woman- but I do have my standards on grits. It looked like microwavable grits with shredded cheese over it.  The crab cake benedict was blah. Very little crab. Add an English muffin and some asparagus, please.  I wanted to like this place. It is close to work. I just can't do it when there are so many better options in Dilworth."}
{"text":"I love this place, for one main reason: California Salad ($10.99).  Grilled chicken, walnuts, goat cheese, berries...what a trip.    The negatives are there - serious wait, usually lots of people outside the door for a 2-3 hour stretch saturdays and sundays.  Also, bacon/meat isn't included in a breakfast platter - so the $6.99 breakfast has to be upcharged $3.29 if you want those two or three strips of bacon.  Occasionally I can get 12 oz or even a pound of bacon around that price.  If you can't tell, I am a big bacon fan so this makes me sad...skipping the bacon makes me sad.  :(  But the food is a good time, they offer sourdough toast, their drinks (mimosa, peach bellini, etc) are awesome for brunch, their servers are fantastic, and holy crap they have a lot of people running around.  I would do that California Salad every day if I could.    As for outside seating - its a screened in and roofed outside, no separate exit or anything, but you get the breeze and air which is nice."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to a Famous Toastery and it was an amazing experience. I had the French Toast combo and it was absolutely breath taking. This restaurant definitely deserves five stars. The food was great and the service was even better!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Both times my food was very good.   First time I had Huervos Ranchos.  Totally not what I expected, but in a good way.  Black beans on the bottom. Tortilla strips, eggs, avocado.  Yum.  Excellent service at the counter.  Second time I had the breakfast burrito.  Good choice, but I'd go with the Huervos again just because it's unique.   Hot coffee kept filled.   Both times my food was out fast.  Cute place."}
{"text":"This is a nice place.  Large, open and airy and has outside patio seating as well as a bar inside.  They serve beer and wine, too!  I've only had the Left Coast BLT with Brie and avocado which is really good.  Eggs and such look good.  I'll have to try it for lunch and dinner another time.  Service can be hit or miss."}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorites but both food and service have gone down in my opinion. Would now rate it as so-so. Hope it is just a cycle with current management and staff."}
{"text":"There was a bit of a wait but it was worth it. The menu was fantastic, service was faster than most locations, and just a friendly atmosphere  I only wish they were opened longer than their posted hours"}
{"text":"Have eaten at this Davidson location many times for both lunch and dinner, solo, with family, friends, etc.  Have always had excellent service, even in the busiest of times.  The manager is super nice. Yesterday was the first time I was truly disappointed with my selection, a turkey club sandwich.  Simple enough, eh?  1 measly slice of turkey was between 2 pieces of sour dough (very good bread) and a single slice of tomato and single lettuce leaf between the other.  I had asked they they not include the ham.  Surely it would occur to someone in the kitchen to SUBSTITUTE an additional slice of turkey, but no such luck. Our bill was $33.+ $5 tip (this poor sandwich by itself is $11!!!) and I'm thinking for $38+, there's no reason a patron should leave HUNGRY. Very disappointed!  Not sure I'll return any longer.  Be careful what you order."}
{"text":"06/22/10  4.5 stars!!  Situated on quaint N. Main Street in Davidson, NC among other shops, such a boutique selling Vera Bradley products and other merchandise (spotted a few cool-looking crystal-topped wine stoppers and hand-painted bottles, as well as pretty designer towelette packs packaged for stowing in purses for emergencies), an art gallery called Sanctuary (also closed), and an ice cream/soda shop called The Soda Shop, Toast Cafe was the perfect fit for our group of four on a beautiful, yet humid morning.  If it weren't for the humidity, we'd have chosen patio seating, as it was VERY loud indoors- the working a/c, as well as the interesting for-sale artwork (provided by Sanctuary) that adorned the walls counteracted the noise typical of a busy breakfast/lunch venue.  I checked the patio out- it was actually quite comfy and cool under the shade of a few trees and MUCH quieter, too!  Next time (and there WILL be a next time!), we'll go for patio-seating.  We ordered coffee and chocolate milk (for my nephew) and looked over the menu.  (I already knew what I wanted, since I perused through TC's menu online.)  There were so many interesting breakfast items to choose from, as well as a lunch and a daily specials flyer, you're bound to find something good!    I ordered biscuits and gravy http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/toast-cafe-davidson?select=yv3VYqto29g32jqQOUov7A#yv3VYqto29g32jqQOUov7A, a side order of raspberry-stuffed French toast (blueberry is another option) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/toast-cafe-davidson?select=vv35QJ2qcnUbv6FK8gdP0g#vv35QJ2qcnUbv6FK8gdP0g,  and one banana-nut flapjack- hold the powdered sugar, please! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/toast-cafe-davidson?select=vyISWE4zMd_5an4_nMosIg#vyISWE4zMd_5an4_nMosIg  Since I was sharing everything I ordered w/ Mom and sister, Mom had a side of plain French toast and sis chose the chicken salad sandwich with coleslaw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/toast-cafe-davidson?select=SHU69bSf9VbfA5zwGgnkmQ#SHU69bSf9VbfA5zwGgnkmQ, after spying a neighboring table's choice.  My nephew wanted a chocolate chip flapjack.  Mom's French toast was nothing special.  Certainly didn't look anything to write home about-- it came plain, w/ powdered sugar, but no whipped cream.  Had to request for some, and no, they don't make their own here, which was a surprising let-down, bec. I would've thought something as charming as Toast Cafe would make its own...  My stuffed French toast was delightful!  (That is, after I returned the first batch, which came w/ a heavy dusting of powdered sugar.)  My sis whole-heartedly agreed!  Thank goodness, that, bec. she helped me polish off the dish-- remember, I had other dishes to sample, too.  :)  Mom, sis, and I also thought the biscuits and gravy dish was a winner!  The creamy gravy was nicely-spiced and had a few chunks of sausage.  (Note to TC: please add more chunks!)  Loved the biscuits!  The banana-nut flapjack was also delicious, but we wanted to finish the B&G (smothered biscuits don't reheat well), and sis and I were doing such a fine job on the French toast...  Sister's chicken salad sandwich looked terrific, and I gathered that it, too, tasted divine.  Judging from the sounds emitted by Mom and sis, the coleslaw wasn't shabby, either!  There was nothing left on my nephew's plate, so I guess he enjoyed his breakfast, as well :)    Sister, who lives in Charlotte, said that she'd love to return.  So would I!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast stops. The omelets are great! You should try the Boursin Omelet. It has thick cut bacon, diced tomatoes and creamy Boursin cheese. Paired with fruit and a freshly squeezed glass of orange juice and you have started your day of right!"}
{"text":"I was super excited about seeing this franchise come a little closer to my current location. As a frequent visitor of the Dilworth location, I knew I would be in for a treat. However, on my first visit to this location I wasn't particularly impressed. I had the griddle combo (gluten-free pancake, egg, turkey sausage and a side of hash browns). The egg portion was smaller than usual and the hash browns were crisp but a little cold.  The pancake was just okay as was the turkey sausage. The service though is exceptional. The staff is super friendly and the service was quick ( I only waited 5-7 mins for my food). Because I love breakfast so much, I'll definitely be back. Next time I plan to try something different. Give it a try for yourself!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at any of the Famous Toastery locations and I think it's a great fit for the university area/Boardwalk. At first, I wasn't too keen on waiting 30 minutes for a table but took that as a good sign of business since they just recently opened. We killed the time taking a lap around the pond. The idea of \"everyone is your server\" makes for a fast-paced customer service setting. Anytime we needed anything it was promptly delivered! The food was great. We both got the stuffed French toast which comes with a side of meat. The cornbread and apple butter pre-meal was delicious! I have no complaints and will definitely be dining here again in the near future."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday. It was the first breakfast place I've been to in the Charlotte area and I was really impressed. The wait was pretty long, but it was a Sunday so I had no problem waiting. You have the option of waiting outside with coffee, which is a very nice option.  After waiting for about twenty minutes, we were seated. Staff were very friendly and there was a nice selection of lunch and breakfast menu items. All the staff members work together to serve you, so if you need something (like a refill on your coffee), it happens quickly.   It didn't take very long for our food to come out and it was quite impressive. My wife got huevos rancheros and I got a runner's omelet. The food was great, but the most surprising part of the experience was that the servers ask if you want coffee and ice water to go. By the way, the quality of the coffee is well above average.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"When we lived in Ballantyne I used to eat at Toast all the time! Now we're in Steele Creek we were pleased to find a Toast down close to us. The food is great but I did enjoy the atmosphere at the other one a bit better. We like to go to breakfast on Sunday mornings and Toast is our place!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. We can during brunch at around 11a. Server was attentive until the restaurant started getting busy (understandable). The omelettes are huge!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my first visit here.  I heard so many great things. First my server was not friendly at all. She did not let us sit down before asking for my drink. She never told us her name and never came back to check on us. We ate with no napkins and never had our drinks refilled. She walked passed our table as we had our cups empty and plates stacked and said nothing. So I timed her and we sat 15 more minutes and still nothing. It's just like she saw us but did not care. I eventually went to another server and asked am I supposed to get Togo things myself? He was nice and apologized but as for my server. Terrible service. When i told the manager. Manager did not offer anything except explain they were understaffed. I understand understaffed, but if i literally watch my server ignore us and look at us, that's not cool. I will return for my military discount because that was the best part ( 50% ) but probably not to this location. We left and walked past our server and she did not even say good bye. Or thank you. I still tipped bc I'm a server but if I didn't care as much as she didn't I wouldn't have tipped anything."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and came in here for lunch. The food and service was great. Our drinks were never empty and the food arrived promptly. The menu was versatile and included beer and wine. The prices were on par with restaurants that we have eaten at throughout the U.S. In other words, not a surprise. My family and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"At this point I can't go back to the Famous Toastery, and in good conscience I can't have anyone going there either.  What is the opposite of flavor country?  Famous Toastery country.  This place can consistently underwhelm me. The service: friendly wait staff but incompetent cook staff.  On the occasions I have braved the Famous Toaster they have managed to mess up my order.  They are incapable of properly poaching an egg on the first two tries, I didn't bother to try for a third so maybe they just can't poach an egg.  Eggs benedict and any variety of it needs to be poached right as the proper yolk is a key part of the experience and flavor.  Ingredients went from missing to be under present.  I ordered an omelet, didn't want to risk another benedict disaster.  I asked for Canadian bacon and hollandaise sauce with my omelet - you guessed it: I tried to get satisfaction with an omelet benedict.  I kept getting a benedict Arnold - betrayed!  They forgot my sauce and they did remove the bacon as I requested but forgot to substitute it with Canadian bacon.  I was missing my salty meat from my omelet benedict.  I pointed out this problem and they made me a new omelet, this time it had the Canadian bacon.  The problem is this omelet came with avocado, the remake had 1/2 of the avocado of the original.  Sadness.  The hollandaise sauce didn't taste like anything.  Imagine if you added some sad melted butter to some bleached flower - you would have the exact same tasteless mush as I had.   No hints of lemon, and they didn't manage to fold the sauce properly at all.  At this point I can't go back to the Famous Toastery, and in good conscience I can't have anyone going there either."}
{"text":"Big Flapjacks . Fresh Orange Juice . Beautiful Mimosas. Soft French Toast . Hash Browns are actually red potato breakfast potatoes. Corn bread with Apple butter was last good wish it was warmer. Big helpings ! The wait was about 25mins for Party of 5 on a Sunday Morning. They seated us quickly."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch with good portions. It has a cute and eclectic vibe near a small local college. The service is very friendly. This place can be popular so you might have a little bit of a wait for a table. But as you know, good things come to those to wait. I had the stuffed French toast the last time I was in. It was an over generous portion that I insisted I wasn't going to finish but I managed the task very happily. It's a great place to meet friends and share a good meal."}
{"text":"Yesterday my 15 year old daughter and I enjoyed poach egg on an English muffin with ovacado and a side of fruit, and tea.  Very good.  30 minutes later my daughter threw up her meal. After throwing up she felt better and today she is fine. I'm sure it was the meal.  I would not eat there again."}
{"text":"Good breakfast and lunch with fast service from order to meal. Their motto \"everyone is your server\" - so true. We have been here three times in a week. The outside dining area welcomed our dog when right across the street we were told the \"city\" doesn't allow dogs outside. Western omelette, shrimp and grits, Ruben sandwich, and the club were all tried and tasty in the same day. We will be back because dogs are allowed."}
{"text":"I live close by and finally got in today to see what the hub-bub is all about. Cannot get in on weekends, too crowded. So, first off this is a fancy breakfast place with some unusual yet delicious sounding selections like scrambled eggs with lobster chunks. I ordered the safe combo which includes 1 egg (over-easy), bacon or sausage patty and French toast or pancakes. I selected the French toast and crispy bacon. Best toast I've ever had so it lived up to the name of restaurant! My hubby ordered the same but opted for scrambled with the sausage. Plus, he got the fresh squeezed orange juice ($5) and it was so good; the real deal and worth the $5. Nice place, great food, really busy, my only complaint is that the chairs are super uncomfortable. Maybe because they want you to leave? Next time I go, I want to try to Boursin omelet with bacon and tomatoes. Not cheap by any means for breakfast but really delicious and fresh food."}
{"text":"Don't go at 7am The music is loud and about 9 magillion employees will hawk you the entire time you eat and not give you one moments peace.   On the other hand- everyone was nice, food was good, bathrooms clean and they were open early!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. We visited from Michigan and went here for breakfast. It was so delicious and the staff is so friendly. We loved it so much we came back for lunch. The Mac and cheese was so delicious I told the staff I won't be able to eat Mac and cheese anywhere else again. We talked to two different waitstaff members and a manager, and they were all so friendly. Whenever we visit we will always stop here to eat."}
{"text":"I am so excited to have an amazing brunch place so close to home. Everything about our visit was perfect!   We walked past a free coffee stand before we got inside. What a great idea to keep people warm and caffeinated while they wait! We were lucky enough to be promptly seated. As we were sitting down my boyfriend made a joke about a round of shots and the waitress said we would have to wait 15 minutes. After a weekend of festivities we didn't order any alcohol but found out valuable information - they can serve alcohol after 10am on Sundays. I have lived in NC for 8 years and I am excited at the prospect of having a mimosa one day without having to wait for lunch.   Our visit started with a complimentary round of cornbread and the best apple butter to accompany it. I ordered the lobster scramble and a coffee. The workers here wait on all the tables which meant someone was always circling with water or coffee, or stopping by to check on us. The food arrived freshly and swiftly. My scramble had a generous portion of lobster and cheese with the occasional broccoli incorporated with the eggs. The fruit cup was the perfect pairing and I gave away my toast to my boyfriend. The portion was so large I couldn't finish all of it though I desperately wanted to.   I can't wait to go back and try some more of their menu items."}
{"text":"Where to begin     Ordered the left coast blt.... Only one piece of the bread was toasted .... There were only two pieces of bacon on the whole thing .... Was told it came with herbed mayo... Pretty sure it was just regular old mayo... The avocado was half brown  and sliced but all clumped together in one section ... Over all horribly thrown together  with no care! The pasta salad it came with looked like pesto but it literally just tastes like plain pasta... And the pasta was way over cooked... Ordered an additional side of fruit... Out of the whopping 6 pieces in the container only the two pieces of pineapple were any good!   The French toast was okay... The scrambled eggs were okay....The hash browns were clearly cut like homefries but under the supervision of the less than mediocre cook who must've been angry.. They arrived half chunked half smashed up... Nasty!   This was the worst toast experience to date. Won't be coming back!!   When you're paying $40 for 2 people you expect to be extremely pleased with the food you've ordered! But instead we are so utterly dissatisfied   *Maybe a manager can go babysit the kitchen and make sure all orders are well put together and not ruined*"}
{"text":"We haven't been to this location in over a year.  One and COMPLETELY done.  Why?  Because of the way they treated us, right out of the hospital, no less.  My daughter had just been through an endoscopy and had not eaten for almost sixteen hours.  We went to this restaurant based on someone's recommendation.  We were one of only three groups in the restaurant on a weekday; another family and a couple were the only other customers there.  What a thrill it was to see the servers, ours included, spend every single moment they could catering to the family right beside us, while it took us twenty minutes just to get a stupid drink order.  Want toast, Other Family?  Done.  Want jelly?  Done.  Extra orange juice?  My pleasure!  Need me to cut your sausage?  Absolutely.  And what about us, the only other family in the joint?  \"We'll get to you in a minute.\"  In this place where \"everyone is your server\" we couldn't TACKLE a server to help us.  I'm guessing it's because we were in jeans and t-shirts and the other family was dressed like Stepfords, but we had no intention to wear our suits and dress clothes to the hospital, so excuse us for our state of dress (sarcasm intended.)  I wanted to leave, but my daughter was so hungry I figured we needed to wait it out.  When we finally got our food, instead of being presented to us like the other table, they literally threw it at us, bumping our drinks which had not been (or would be) refilled.  Imagine my surprise when we were served tiny servings of food we could have easily gotten at Cracker Barrel for a lot cheaper and a LOT friendlier.  We ate what we could, I fetched some to-go boxes myself (because I didn't want to wait an hour for the servers to drag themselves away from the Stepfords to do it) and we packed up to go.  And your lousy ten-percent tip?  Not the norm, since we usually tip twenty to twenty-five percent, but we don't pay for a fat lot of nothing.  I lodged a complaint but never heard back, so that pretty much proved to me just how little they cared for our patronage.  For the record, I did give the Indian Land location a shot and it was a lot nicer.  And I didn't have to dress like a Stepford to be treated decently."}
{"text":"We love this place. Serves great food and FAST! Service is usually quick and always with a smile. Great quality for the price."}
{"text":"Went to Toast for a birthday celebration with a crowd of eight. It's located on Main Street in Davidson, and on a Wednesday night there was no problem finding parking. The decor was quaint and the service was very good considering the large party and the fact that the restaurant was fairly full.   I ordered off of the Prix Fixe menu, which gets you three courses for $17; a salad (or soup of the day), choice of an entree, and choice of a dessert. I had the Toast salad with parmesan vinaigrette, which was amazing! Then I had the best chicken pot pie I've ever tasted as my entree. For dessert I had \"Frannie's Chocolate Delight,\" which is a cross between a lava cake and a not-quite-cooked-through brownie with vanilla ice cream on the top. It was unbelievable - so good and a must have if you ever make it to Toast. They also bring bread to the table with an amazing butter that you just have to try, and bottles of wine are half-off on Wednesdays.  It is a bit of a hike from the uptown area, but totally worth it if you want great food and good service."}
{"text":"So it's Mother's Day and my sweet mother works on the weekend so I thought I would get her lunch from here and surprise her. I called at 1:15 pm and ordered 2 sandwiches. The lady on the phone told me it'd be ready in TEN minutes. So I come at 1:30. They tell me my order will be ready in a \"few minutes\". LOL. Come 1:55pm, a waiter comes from the kitchen with 1 of the sandwiches and says in front of me \"I hope you guys have the Reuben up here!\" And no, they did not. So come 2:10pm my order finally comes out. Listen, I get it, it's busy and Mother's Day HOWEVER, maybe don't tell your customer to come 50 minutes before their order is ready. And then in front of the customer say that you don't even know where the other half of their order is. Just food for thought!"}
{"text":"Toast Cafe in Dilworth is one of my new favorite spots for breakfast, lunch or brunch. I have enjoyed 4 meals here recently with tasty food and superior service. The prices aren't bad either. Toast also has a location in Davidson and a new Toast is set to open soon in Ballantyne. The menu is diverse yet simple, creative but not fussy. I really like the lobster roll - above - which is not something easy to find in the south. I also dig the omelets including the avocado omelet with bacon and parmesan - so delicious - and the complimentary cornbread and apple butter served during weekend brunch. I love that I can walk to Toast and that they are so busy - we recently waited about 30 minutes for brunch - hopefully this is a sign they will be around for a long time. I look forward to returning again soon to try even more items - if I can bear not to have my favorites!"}
{"text":"I'll start with sting I only got omelettes and coffee, but 3 days in a row due to work travel, so I have no idea how good everything else is.   First off, the coffee is not very good, to the point that day 2 barely drank one cup and the third day I just got water. I'm a coffee fan, so bad coffee is a huge ding on their part for trying to be a breakfast joint.   The omelette was just fine. Actually two times the insides were still partly cold (fully cooked, they had precooked mushrooms and onions).   I give 3 stars because everything was just fine, but nothing I ate stood out as great either, nothing to make me want to come back. Enough that in the future when I'm in the area, I'll likely enjoy my breakfast at a different breakfast restaurant."}
{"text":"YUMMMMM!  My husband and I stopped at Toast for breakfast yesterday after hitting up the Davidson Farmer's Market(also fabulous!).  Our wait was maybe 10-15 minutes despite the place being pretty crowded at 10:30am.  Breakfast was great!  The coffee was delicious.  I got the Saturday scramble with hash browns and a biscuit.  The eggs and biscuits were both great!  They have the best biscuits around in my opinion!   The hash browns left a little to be desired as they were pretty bland.  Service was good as well despite the place being packed.  Overall, we had a great time!  I think this may become our weekly routine!  Farmers market..then Toast!! :)"}
{"text":"A wonderful place for a weekend breakfast.  Service is excellent and I highly recommend the corned beef hash.  I think it is fine without the hollandaise sauce but maybe hedge your bets by getting it on the side  my friend had an omelet that she said was awesome as well.  I'm looking for excuses to head back to Davidson and enjoy some more delicious food here!"}
{"text":"Decent food, fast seating despite being busy, and fast food service. I had special Lox Benedict. My friend had the Cali Benny, eggs Benedict with avocado. Both were good  The potatoes that come with the dishes were nothing special; the cornbread they serve before the food comes out was dry & pretty flavorless. Their biggest area for improvement is their coffee - it was simply brown water."}
{"text":"Great food and view of the boardwalk. Not a fan of location as parking becomes difficult during peak hours. They also have an array for mimosas and breakfast cocktails. Oh and if you are a late weekend sleeper you will miss out on this Gem, as they close at 3pm. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Small rustic setting. Service tremendous. Constantly filling water coffee etc   I had the hash with sunny eggs and Hollandaise. Food came out nice and hot. My wife had the eggs with avocado and hollandaise. My daughter juevos rancheros.   Would go back"}
{"text":"Had a great brunch experience on our first visit here. Had two eggs scrambled, choice of toast (sourdough is delish), and choice of potatoes, grits, or fruit (grits always). Daughter had French toast and potatoes. I tried all of it, and have no complaints. Even on a busy Sunday after church, the wait was only 15 minutes and there was plenty of indoor/outdoor seating to accommodate those waiting. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"The quality and value of the food is outstanding. They can make any sandwich into a wrap. I especially enjoy being able to order breakfast at anytime of the day. A must visit for south Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The food is good. However breakfast is breakfast. Hard to do it bad unless you overcharge... Which is the problem at Toast. You can pay half the price for the same thing elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant.  They had scramble specials named after, the last three, 2016 presidential candidates.  I went with Bernie (as I would in real life). It was delicious! scrambled eggs, with spinach, goat cheese, and smoked salmon.  I didn't want the capers and they accommodated.  Every server is your server which is a great little concept.  They staff was very friendly and helpful.  I also tried a pomegranate apple mimosa.  I will have to post the pictures later.  I was extremely happy and can't wait to get back to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Toast is always packed on the weekends for brunch. Despite the craziness, service is still quick and courteous.   We usually come here in a huge party (12+) and everyone is satisfied since there are so many options on the menu."}
{"text":"This little gem is fabulous!! Breakfast and lunch options all day along with daily specials. If you go on Tuesday, you must try the Sweet Heat club. The bacon alone is hands down the best I've ever had!! The only negative thing that I could say about this place is that it's a little pricey. But hey, you get what you pay for!!  Hope you enjoy as much as I. Oh, and there are lots of other neat restaurants and retail stores in this little village as well as paddle boats."}
{"text":"I really liked Toast! The service was excellent and despite having a pretty packed house they were able to accommodate us without any wait.  I went with the lobster rolls which were delicious though light but I will say the cucumber salad lacked quite a bit. This salad was simply vinegar on cucumbers with dill...but the odd thing is it was served with a pickle spear on the side. Next time I'd choose a different side.   My dad had the coconut pancakes which didn't taste very coco-nutty but they were nice and fluffy and served in a heaping stack. My mom had a pretty killer breakfast sandwich that she loved, and my boyfriend ate his meal ( I can't recall what it was).  The sandwiches next to us looked fabulous, I will try the club next time.   I'd definitely give Toast another shot, especially for lunch!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to having the opportunity to try out this place, based on so many good reviews from friends.  We finally had the chance and everything we ordered was very good.  I thought the pancakes were light and fluffy and had really good flavor and the bacon was really good.  The only drawback for us was a few of the charges.  I ordered the combo and when I was asked how I wanted my egg, I ordered only the egg white.  When the bill came, I was charged an extra $1.99 for my selected style of egg.  I was also surprised at the cost of a kid's juice.  We ordered a kid's plate, which was $5.99 (pretty average price) and the juice charge was $2.99.  So we ended up spending $9 for a 4-year old.  Again, the food was very good and we will likely go back, I just may leave the kids at home."}
{"text":"Have eaten here two or three times, every time is excellent service, and excellent food. The meatloaf sandwich at Lunch is so good!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for breakfast and brunch. 5$ mimosas with fresh squeezed juice.  The food was freshly prepared in a timely manner. Our waiter was a great young man who was very attentive."}
{"text":"The challah French toast was pretty amazing and reminded me of a brunch place in Berkeley that I absolutely love.   The bloody Mary's need a bit more bite.. I like a Bloody Mary with brunch and theirs was just ok.   My mom had a club and said it was good."}
{"text":"Most reviews say there is a wait on weekends. If you're looking to get in and out fast try a week day. Stopped by on a weekday around 7:30 (they open at 7). We were seated right away and from sitting to paying it was about 40 minutes.   During this time, it seemed like a lot of business people were there for meetings or grabbing a quick meal before work.  I wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. I ordered two eggs, potatoes (extra crispy) and sourdough bread. The potatoes were amazing! They are red skins with a delicious seasoning - no ketchup needed. The sourdough bread was average. With the name \"Toastery\" I had higher expectations. I did like that the toast came plain (no butter already on it).   I had a bite of the black beans in the huevos rancheros dish and they were outstanding. Next time I go back, I'll be ordering that dish. They don't skimp on the avocado either. It looked like the give you a whole one. If you order this, make sure you're hungry! It's a generous portion."}
{"text":"A nice little breakfast placer that offers a variety of tasty gluten-free options. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they offered gluten-free french toast, which was very good.   The place looks like it can get a bit crowded but don't let that stop you. Also saw a few people outside dogs which was cool."}
{"text":"New spot.....been opened for a year and a half......the owner Patrick was extremely nice.....breakfast, brunch or lunch only.....opened 7am -3pm Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Meeting friends for breakfast on a lovely spring morning in Charlotte, what could possibly go wrong? Well, it's NC so no mimosa on Sunday morning :-( that's what can go wrong. Table in the back lovely view of the pond, nobody on the water but the ducks. Yea ducks!! Finagled the tables around and everyone got situated and beverages requested and corn breaded (apple butter and texas pete make life good). Was having a hard time deciding among the benedicts so I went with the corned beast hash and eggs up. Came out a little more geometric than I expected but still very well executed and the half orange wheel filled the frame nicely. The hash is a little finer than I am used to but had a good crispy dark crust with a softer, lighter center. Eggs were spot on, firm whites under the hollandaise with soft runny yolks making a delicious mess of everything. No bread included so I had to request a biscuit for sopping. Big windows let in lots of light, dining room lay out has plenty of seating options: inside, outside, upside, bar side, and still has room to move about and visit. Friendly staff helps when nobody is your server so sorting out the check afterwards is almost fun."}
{"text":"Great food and Great service. First time at this location and it's just as I hoped, perfect. Tons of servers so service was spot on, they all work together and it was flawless. The food came out Fast! We went on a busy Saturday morning and got our food in about 10 minutes. Food was hot and delicious. Perfect portion and fair price. It's good to know that multiple locations can keep the food consistent. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast and lunch!  The left coast blt is delicious, the best ones I've ever had.  Their bread is fresh and toasted perfectly.   You can substitute the sides for a salad.  The wait can be long on weekends, but they take down your number and text you when your table is ready.  The free coffee, corn hole, and Tuesday morning (located beside toast) makes the wait go by quickly.  I have ordered to go multiple times to avoid the wait."}
{"text":"My bride and I have been hooked on Toast for years.  We lived in Huntersville before moving Uptown and had grown fond of that location and it's staff.  We were thrilled when the Dilworth location opened.  I have now been to this particular location 5+ times and I'm still hooked.  This is by far one of the best breakfast locations in the Carolinas.  The only breakfasts I would even rank with the quality of food and service would be Poogan's in Charleston and George's Brasserie in Charlotte.  My bride orders the Raspberry Walnut Pancakes with Bacon and she can't branch out for new dishes because they are just that good.  Very fresh and they don't skimp on the ingredients.  These are also my favorites of the pancake and french toast selections.  I've tried the basic breakfast, the Cali Benny (avocado, tomato, poached egg, hollandaise), the Crab Benedict, Eggs Benedict, Bacon Egg and Cheese Sandwich, and many more.    I'm still highly impressed with the service and your cup of coffee never empties.  Excellent teamwork.  We bring our family here when they visit and they request each time now as well!  *Another visit update... We went for our first Sunday visit and had to add onto my review.  The floor service is a well oiled machine.  There was a 25 minute wait for our two top and they manage to turn service without making you feel rushed.  As soon as a table frees up, they had it bussed, cleaned, and seated within 2 minutes.  Excellent food as always including a special : southwest scramble.... Awesome."}
{"text":"Headed over to Famous Toastery for our brunch fix on a Sunday morning. There was a long wait but we wanted to sit on the patio with our dog so we were seated immediately. It was a little toasty (pun intended) -- but life of dog parents. Took awhile for us to get greeted, but after that, service was very quick. No one told me about the delicious cornbread and apples they bring you! Yum!   We both really wanted the Lobster Benedict but couldn't decide if $18 each was worth it. We settled on one lobster benedict and one crab cake benedict so we could have one of each. The lobster came out with fruit, and when I told the server who delivered it that we wanted potatoes instead, he immediately brought them out. Let me tell you. The potatoes make the meal here. They are super seasoned and delicious. The lobster benedict was delicious with the dill hollandaise. The crab cake benedict tasted a little off so I wouldn't get again.   Looked like they had a great cocktail selection even though we were there a little early for that."}
{"text":"I've taken folks here on several occasions and to date they yet to disappoint.  Fair warning: Be prepared to wait a bit before being seated! It's a popular brunch destination.  One cool thing about FT is they have adopted a program where \"every server is your server\" and I think that is very helpful because it doesn't necessarily leave you sitting there waiting on your original server if they 'disappear!'   When it comes to the menu, there is plenty to choose from and typically takes me a bit to decide what I want - even if I roll in thinking I have a slight idea what I'm craving! I haven't really been disappointed by any of the food. Some of the drinks are questionable... my girlfriend ordered the bakon bloody mary and it very confusing how it came out almost 'frozen?' - the crushed I was a weird way to do it... I also ordered a peach bellini (my first) and I didn't necessarily care for it (not sure how to compare to others since it was my first.)  The food is always on point and always fulfilling! There is no walking away hungry. You definitely pay a premium for it, but it comes out as described and I've never had to send anything back - which is always a plus...  Famous Toastery will always be an option as long as I remain in the Charlotte region!"}
{"text":"Been to this place twice in the last couple weeks. Everything is really fresh and delicious. The sausage gravy and biscuits is sooo good and I usually hate sausage gravy! The Cali beni is also really good. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they didn't give enough hollandaise sauce with the eggs Benedict. That's the best part, don't be stingy! Other than that I have no complaints at all. And they serve breakfast/brunch until 3:00! It's so hard to find a brunch spot during the week. Will return many times."}
{"text":"I am in LOOOVE with Toast and all of the franchises that are popping up! The food is the same no matter which location I decide to visit. Stonecrest is closest however I ate at the Dilworth location to meet my sister for brunch(she is a newbie). She was so pleasantly surprised that the 25 min table wait was only 10. The food was fresh and full of flavor. The staff assisted with all of our needs especially since we had 3 children with us. YES! GO TO TOAST! TRY THE CORNBEEF HASH AND SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH GRUYERE CHEESE.. (My order EVERY time) you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been known to have toast for breakfast, so I have no problem eating at a place called Toast - or Famous Toastery for that matter. While the servers are generally attentive, the promise of the place falls squarely between that of toast and something famous.  To start with, we were there on a day when things were a bit windy, and though it was nice enough outside to sit on the patio, the way the umbrellas were arranged/installed/whatever wasn't particularly up-to-snuff, so every time a bit of wind came by, it actually caught them like a sail, and they took off, ready to spear anyone not paying attention. Made things interesting, to say the least. While those attentive servers were nice, they didn't seem particularly interested in much other than plopping the umbrellas back in the hole, ready for another round later. Ah well.  We did survive our meal, and it was a sold effort - but one you can find in a reasonable number of places around, something more than fast food breakfast (something that is being offered in more and more places these days), and perhaps on par with other sit-down, diner-type places. If you're in the area, it's probably worth a visit to see if things have improved. Just watch out for the flying umbrellas if you're seated outside on a windy day."}
{"text":"We had brunch this morning, service was great, the new chef even saluted us and let us try one of his wonderful bread pudding! Great time. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now. When they started out, I wasn't a big fan, but obviously they have slowly ironed out all the creases and are getting close to perfection.  We usually go here for weekend brunch. We love their meatloaf sandwich - it's amazing! Their breakfast foods are quite good too. The only thing I have found disappointing really are the crepes which are often offered as a special, and aren't on the regular menu. I find it silly that they come stuffed with cream cheese and there is no option to get the cream cheese on the side. Really? The chef can't put a filling on the side? Hmm. I must say that the wonderful fresh orange juice squeezing machine makes up for that though. The orange juice is $4 a glass, but well worth it. The juice is squeezed right in front of you and has no added sugars. They call it liquid gold. Yeah, it's really that good!"}
{"text":"Had a better experience for our to go order. Gentleman was friendly on the phone and repeated the whole order. Picked up our food and it was ready by the time we got there. Food was delicious and we didn't have any issues!"}
{"text":"We came for brunch and they were packed out! People were parking on the side of the building. We didn't have to wait long to have a table. Their concept is that you don't have just one server. Everyone is your server which can be a good thing and a bad thing. We gave a nice lady our order. Our food came at a decent time. It was all really delicious but my husband asked for a side of salsa and it wasn't brought out with our food. Everyone was so busy it was hard to stop someone to ask. No one really checked on us either. Someone came by and asked if we wanted more drink since everyone's drink was low. My husband asked that person for a side of salsa and she said she will get it. But right when she left our table, someone stopped her and told her to go fill up another table's drink and that kind of escalated. It took forever to bring out the salsa. To me that's not very organized. I'm not sure if everyone is just relying on everyone else to check tables but it was not good service. We probably won't go back. Not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in a fantastic little spot!   My father and I are in town home-hunting for me and on the way down to Charlotte from the Concord airport we stumbled onto this spot by way of Yelp. SO HAPPY we found this gem!   Food is spot on. Especially for all the Gluten-Free esters such as myself, this is the most amazing find. GLUTEN FREE FRENCH TOASTS AND PANCAKES?! They also taste amazing and fluffy!   Service was great, everyone was so attentive and so kind. Father thoroughly enjoyed his Avocado Omelette as it vanished. (Always a good sign) Orange Juice has never tasted fresher and the little corn cakes they give you to start off your meal is a very cute treat.   This place left such a good impression that my dad and I stopped by the Concord location on the way to the airport. Don't miss pass on a fantastic, healthy, hearty, happy food experience!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot.  It's about a 30 or so minute wait on the weekend.  They offer corn bread with apple sauce when you are seated.  I'm not from this area, but that corn bread was amazing. So sweet tasting.    They offered a shrimp and grits special, which was so good.  It came with a biscuit.  They really know how to make bread in the South.  The dish had a nice kick to it and the grits were nice and cheesy.  I really enjoyed my meal and would come back again."}
{"text":"What an amazing spot! Came with my friend for lunch and all the serving staff was outstanding, personable, and smiling. I had the grilled chicken and bacon wrap which was on point as well as the pesto pasta salad. My friend had an omelet with a homemade biscuit that was outstanding! All very fresh ingredients! Cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is a pretty easy meal to cook, especially since theirs is nothing too fancy on this menu. The wait was absolutely ridiculous. We were told 20-25 minutes and ended up waiting an hour. Fair enough for brunch on a Sunday but the hostess was rude when we came up to check in about how much longer the wait would be. Food was pretty good but the service we received made for a negative experience which is part of the meal. Probably won't be back. There are plenty of other breakfast spots in Charlotte with better quality food, service and pricing."}
{"text":"Very cute place on a very cute street.  Friendly servers (every server is your server - great concept).   All tables, mostly 4-tops, with contoured wooden chairs.   The quiche is ok. The bottom crust is thick and dense (almost soggy) but the eggs were well done. But it seemed to be reheated, not freshly/recently cooked.  The potatoes were very good (large pieces covered with Montreal seasoning and grilled).  Cinnamon raisin toast was a late addition to our order and came out right away, so it was already made, and it tasted like it.  The crust was almost unchewable, and it wasn't hot enough to melt the butter. We got a burrito and added sausage.  The burrito was ok, but not very hot."}
{"text":"Ate Sunday brunch here yesterday. The food is usually pretty good but today was not the case. May be partly our fault (or not) because we came at 2:30 and they close at 3. We usually try not to go to restaurants near closing time out of respect for employees and the food is usually not as good. In this case we knew what we wanted and ordered pretty much immediately after sitting down. The food however was not the food I'm used to from Toast. My breakfast was just OK overall and the potatoes were luke warm and kinda hard. I didn't send them back for new ones because of the time and just took one to the chin being we came so late. I will probably never come so late again unless pressed to do so. The service, as always was good and food is usually the same. I will go back."}
{"text":"We came here because of the great reviews. The restaurant was previously called The Toast but was renamed for legal reasons. No matter because every local calls it The Toast.  We had a good meal very average with an above average price tag for the quantity and quality of food that they serve. First, the service of our greeting house and the wait staff was great. Second, the specials were well varied and interesting. We tried the cheddar grits and shrimp with added sausage. The grits were slimy definitely prepared according to package instructions. The Shrimp was Cajun and tasty. The sausage was less than desirable. It was not the usual sausage in this dish more of a hot dog sized red sausage quartered and placed on the top with grease poured on top to slide around the surface of the grits and fill the valleys left by the shrimp.  If you are used to try Southern fare this presentation is disappointing. Sanitation - This is the reason for the rating of 2.  Waiting for my food I saw a busboy use his hand an upper arm in place if tissue then open the kitchen area to stick that hand/arm with snot into the icemaker to fill up a translucent \"barrel\" then take the polluted ice to the drink station (soda) to fill it with contaminated ice for use by the entire staff serving iced drinks. When I told our waiter/host, he apologized that I SAW him do that and told me that he would talk to the busboy. Nothing else was done. Waiters continued to use the contaminated ice during our meal. Ugh!   To make matters more disgusting a second male waiter wiped his nose  with his hand and went to take orders from the table beside us. The food is good just don't look up at the fuzz on the cute lattice screen hanging above your head as you eat.  The bathrooms are cute but the toilet paper dispensers are in disrepair. I think the usual crowd has stopped paying close attention to the service that they receive and the cleanliness levels. I guess that is a good thing in thus case. Yum!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast place. Not busy on Tuesday morning when I went with a coworker. The restaurant did film up quickly by the time we were heading out. I had the French toast, she had one of the Benedicts. The mimosas and Bellinis were only $5 a piece! Mine was strong but my coworker said hers were mostly juice so it may be hit or miss. The French toast comes plain so I added strawberries, it was kind of dry and needed two large pours of maple syrup. That being said, I really liked it. Glad to see real maple syrup on the table here. Coffee was strong."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. It was absolutely terrible. To start with our food didn't come out for an hour. We had to ask where it was. Then when it came out the avocados weren't even taken out of the shell. The potato's weren't cooked, then the poached eggs were the worst poached eggs I've ever seen. They were over cooked and shriveled. They didn't even toast my toast. The buffalo chicken wrap was just buffalo chicken wrapped in the wrap nothing else inside. Didn't even have any sauces in them. It was grilled chicken. It was dry chicken zero buffalo sauce in it. This was shit."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here. Nice and relaxing environment. Love the orange juice ! Will be returning once again!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre food. After trying this after talking about it for so long my first experience was the last. The pancakes where ENTIRELY too sweet. The wraps are literally to die for because I'd rather die than eat one again or eat here again. BTW this review is for the Concord, NC location."}
{"text":"I visited for the first time yesterday and was pleasantly surprised by the spacious layout and lovely decor. The atmosphere felt so welcoming, similar to the country vibe at Cracker Barrel. I tried the waffle with strawberries and whipped cream. The waffle could've been cooked a little longer but the dish overall was tasty. I really appreciated the waiter and his friendly service. My hot chocolate came with whipped cream and chocolate drizzle on top.... so yummy! I want to try the shrimp and grits next time."}
{"text":"Love this place and will be back for more!  As you come in to be seated there's coffee for you to sample. The crew works as a team to deliver great, efficient service.  You get some nice cornbread sample while you wait for your food to come.  Their orange juice is pricey but worth it if you're a fan of Freshly-squeezed OJ.  I feel like I can ask for anything to accompany my meal without feeling nickeled and dimmed.  We had Omelets, and they came out super fast. Their hash browns and grits were on point!  Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great find! Its clean a large restaurant well organized food was excellent staff too will definately go here again soon thanks yelp for helping me find this place. Grits were the best ive eaten in charlotte"}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday and had a little bit of a wait (~10-15 min) for the 10:30AM timeframe, which isn't bad when can start to catch up with friends on a nice day. As a first-timer perusing the menu, nothing stood out to me as a \"must-have\" as the items were traditional breakfast and some regular sandwiches.   I opted for the base food items of: scrambled eggs, bacon, and french toast to see how well they do the basics.  Maybe this was the problem as they were just OK.  Nothing special but they were all cooked well.  I've also had better cornbread, but that's free here, so doesn't move the needle.  I also chose the gluten-free french toast among a few items where you can choose between that or regular, for no extra cost.  Thank you for that Toast!  My brunchmates got various scambles which you can get at most similar restaurants.  The Runner would have been my next choice though (turkey, brie, egg whites, mushrooms).  The service was also just ok, as we sat outside but we didn't feel rushed to leave as I'm sure we were holding our table longer than normal.  It was so 'not rushed' that nobody ever came to pick up the check and payment, until we had to flag someone down.  Maybe we were there so long our server ended their shift..  I would come back just for the brunching with friends experience, not necessarily to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little brunch spot but it is so popular.  We went on a Sunday afternoon at around 11.  We had a 6 people in our party, so we called for reservations, they dont take these.  Ick.  So, we got there and i was surprised they offered valet.  A nice touch, especially for this part of town.  The wait was 45 minutes to an hour and no room at the bar/inside.  We waited outside and found they had a complimentary coffee bar and cornhole!  Very nice touches!  There were a mix of tables inside and outside and when we were seated we got one of the nice outside tables.    The food was great.  I had the runner omlet which was packed full of veggies and turkey meat.  One thing to note here is that service is what they call team service.  So most of the time you don't have just one server, you can have numerous servers and they all treat you as if you are their table.  This service can have pros and cons, but mostly we felt taken care of from everyone.  They know their clientele and definetly deliver in food and atmosphere.  I loved this place and will be back before long!"}
{"text":"Really liked the atmosphere.  the first time I went I ordered a traditional eggs, sausage bacon breakfast.  It was ok, hard to mess that sort of thing up.  Price was high however.  Second time I ordered the french toast.  Man, I gotta tell ya, that is when you get the gist of a place.  When you don't cook the toast enough and you start putting your own little twist to it.  That's when a place blows it.  French toast is pretty much eggs, some cream or milk and bread.  There isn't anything else though you can have a separate cinnamon version.  So, I guess I like a traditional American breakfast.  I don't want California influences or European tripe when I sit down for a good American belly full of breakfast.  Again, the price was ridiculously high.  'A' for atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's ok. Small portions and ok service. Waitress never checked on us and the place was dead. I like to be left alone but I also like to be able to ask for something so I can enjoy my food.Not sure about all the rage. Sometimes it might be better not hear good things about a place so you don't get let down"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Toast for breakfast and lunch so thought we might get it a try for dinner...  We walked in around 6:30pm on a Friday night,  the restaurant was about half filled. There were plenty of seats in the the front of the restaurant but our party of four was seated in the very back beside the bathrooms and back door.  We sat there for a few minutes (not wanting to be difficult or affecting the order in which the servers were sat)  but  we really couldn't take the cold draft from the back patio door and constant bathroom visits.  We politely ask if we could move to the front.  The hostess obliged but didn't seem too happy about it.  The same server continued to wait on us once we sat in the front (we were glad because we did not want to make him lose a table) .   We were brought a loaf of soft bread to table, pretty tasty but the butter is a little different.  It is a sweet butter with orange zest.   We were told they were out of the ricotta ravioli (the dish I happened to be eyeing) but was told they can substitute the mushroom ravioli.  I ordered the mushroom ravioli,  my husband the lasagna, our friends ordered the chicken pot pie (all white meat), and chicken Marsala with ravioli side.   The server came back out and told us there was only enough ravioli for one of us...... so my friend changed his order to the green beans and mashed potato side. When our  meals came out they served him ravioli, he was told by the server they found some ravioli in the back- um okay, would have been nice to know before he got his meal as he was already looking forward to eating the dish he thought he ordered.  He was served a 2 mushroom ravioli and 1 ricotta (which he said was much better than the mushroom).  I was told by my friends that the chicken Marsala and chicken pot pie were good. My husband's lasagna was good but very rich!! I could only eat a couple bits, he couldn't finish it.  My mushroom ravioli was bland and tasteless. The cream sauce was very watery. I did not enjoy my main dish at all.   On the bright side though, we all got salads and really enjoyed them. I had the small blue wedge salad. It was a large portion with fresh cooked crispy bacon on top. Really good!   Our server disappeared  while we were eating our meal.  The lady who had been refilling our waters took over our table and closed our checks.  As we were leaving, we see our server  sitting behind the bar, playing on his phone and chatting with other guests.... We probably will not be returning to Toast for dinner. It just seemed way to pretentious and we were not impressed by the food or the 93.5 sanitation grade."}
{"text":"Met some friends here on Sunday after church for the first time. We had about a 35 minute wait for a four top. Here \"every server is your server\" but I could see how easy it is to be forgotten about. My coffee cup was empty while I struggled to make eye contact with one of the many servers running around to ask for a refill. I had the two eggs and bacon. Eggs were cooked over medium like I liked but the edges were little hard (as if cooked too fast), bacon was nice a crispy with good flavor. I also ordered a side blueberry pancake which was tasty as well. You could actually taste the wild blueberry flavor unlike other blueberry pancakes I've had before. Over all... Nice time and enjoyed brunch but not one of the best breakfasts I've ever had and a bit over priced."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service, my first time visiting.. wish I had another day in Charlotte would be back tomorrow!'"}
{"text":"Horrible, awful customer service. Hostess was rude and incompetent. We will never eat here again."}
{"text":"It seems like Charlotte has a shortage of non-chain breakfast locales. Sure, we have plenty of Bo Jiggles (Jangles), a few diners, and a handful of upscale breakfast/brunch locales. But how about the moderately priced? Toast fills that void.   When I worked in Huntersville a few years back I adored that Toast location. ADORED. I would swoon over the quiche, the fast, family like service and the adorable home the restaurant was housed in. Well, that location closed, and a few years later, now we have a Toast in Dilworth. The expansive space feels different, but the menu still offers a variety of breakfast and lunch items that will surely please the masses.  I stopped in on a Friday morning, so I had zero trouble grabbing a table. This environment is very, very different that the weekend. Pack your patient pants if you are looking for a meal on a Saturday or Sunday morning.   Service was friendly and quick and efficiently brought over my order - the strawberry and cream cheese French toast. It was a hearty plate filled with four diagonally cut French toast pieces, filled with the fair amount of sweetened cream cheese and a few strawberries. I would have preferred more strawberries and a bit more pizazz, but it was flavorful nonetheless. I chose sausage patties for my side and they sufficed just fine.   Overall, Toast is a solid breakfast spot and seeing the huge crowds it pulls on Saturday and Sunday alone, I imagine they'll do just fine."}
{"text":"I wish every restaurant handled being busy like toast does! We went around 130 on a Saturday afternoon and, because there was just two of us, was able to sit down right away. The waiters float around and help every table so you do not have a specific waiter. This seemed to work out great. We ordered and received our food in record time. Their menu has a lot of options for both breakfast and lunch so it will appease most palates. It's fairly pricey for breakfast in my opinion but it was a great experience while we visited Davidson for the afternoon."}
{"text":"We've been to toast several times. Always fairly busy, but always great service. Their Benedicts are on point. The service is very fast and friendly. Overall plenty of good options throughout the menu."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast spot. Nothing is really to die for, but it has lots of options and its all good food. Its also priced pretty well. Another great thing about this place is their super fast service, which is a huge plus."}
{"text":"Went during the soft opening. Not really or good or bad. We tried several egg dishes and French toast. That person said the French toast was just ok. The waiter asks you how you like your eggs cooked, but also how well done. We all asked for the whites cooked and yolk runny. All three of use had undercooked eggs yuck.  The eggs Benedict had lots of hollandaise sauce but NO flavor. Fruit salad was small and not quite ripe. The corned beef is house cooked but the hash had VERY little corned beef and the potatoes were mushy and more like mashed. Again very bland! Will NOT order that again This is not a destination restaurant. Overpriced, BLAND, loud too many errors.  I may try it one more time but not expecting much until they get a cook with a palate and pride."}
{"text":"The food is terrible and the service compliments the food. Our food came out within 10 mins or less of placing our order which was great. The check was placed on the table when the food came out, however we thought it was left on the table from a previous guest because the server didn't make reference to the bill. Therefore after we had completed our meals we sat there waiting for the bill until we flagged down a server passing by.  Also, my cappuccino fell over and splattered all over the table and no one came by to help clean up the mess. We had to flag down another server who eventually came over with additional napkins.   When we brought this information to the attention of the cashier she stated that all the servers work together. However, not a single server asked us how our food was or checked to see if we needed anything.   Overall, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Charlotte for the first time. And we hope that this restaurant doesn't represent the service Charlotte provides."}
{"text":"There's a guy outside dressed up like a piece of toast. How could you not like this place?!  The key phrase you must remember if you want to have brunch here: arrive early. They do not take reservations. Expect a wait. However, it's not so bad. Toast has a complimentary coffee bar (cute little paper cups) and cornhole outside. The place is hopping. Diverse crowd. Kids, families, boozy brunchers, dogs of all kinds.  Our group of seven arrived at 10AM Sunday. The wait for us was only around ten minutes. We were seated outside on the patio. Beautiful day for brunch outside.  I debated forever on my order. Basically, I fought with myself over which version of eggs benedict to get. Come on, there's nothing better than cutting into a soft poached egg and watching the delicious drizzle. I finally landed on the Cali Benny: Poached Eggs, Avocado, Tomato, English Muffin & Hollandaise. Great sauce. It came with a side of potatoes. I'm usually not the biggest fan of home fries, but these were seasoned and yummy. Didn't even need ketchup or hot sauce. I ate everything on my plate.  Quite possibly my favorite thing about this place: you pay at the counter. Think about it. When you go to brunch, you usually have to split your check up a bunch of different ways. Takes time for a server to do that, close everyone out. Here, you just take your check and go straight to the cashier. Makes turnover time for tables quicker.  I'm definitely a fan. If I can ever get my crew going by 10am, this is the place we'll hit up for some breakfast goodness. Now if only we could get the state of North Carolina to serve me a mimosa before noon on a Sunday...."}
{"text":"The service at this location is out of this world. I think your food arrives within five minutes of ordering. We have been here several times and have had the pleasure of Matthew B as our waiter. He does a great job and always checks back.  Tom"}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch spots in Charlotte! They always have great specials too!"}
{"text":"Our Saturday morning spot, really great breakfast and the staff is always attentive and fast. Food is always fresh and hot and they are happy to accommodate special requests."}
{"text":"I love this place! The interior is decorated nicely and there's a section that overlooks the water. The staff works on a team basis, and all my experiences have been with very friendly people.   I've only ever eaten breakfast food from here because it's been so good I've never wanted to stray! I like that they have different specials so I can mix it up sometimes, but I already have a couple of items on the menu that I find myself ordering time and time again.   They have great hash browns and serve corn bread with apple butter to have with your coffee while you wait for your food. I'd recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast. Weekends can be a little busy but week days are easy to get in and out very quickly. Great quality food partnered with a good cook makes for a great meal. My favorite is the corned beef hash with 2 eggs. The hash has a nice salty, crisp and taste amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 3 star because the service was awful. This was my first time there and the hostess was wonderful so I had high hopes for this place. After being seated, we were promptly welcomed and were served our drinks. After we ordered our food, we had not seen a server and no one came to our table to check on us. They say that \"everyone is your server\" but that just seemed like an excuse for them to not check on us. We waited for our food for about 35 minutes which was an okay wait. Still after getting our food, no server came to check on us. I had to wave down a bus boy for our bill after waiting 15 minutes after being done eating because there was still no server paying us any mind or in sight. I waited another 10 minutes for a server to come get my bill and payment but no one came so I had to walk up to the bar to pay and the server there was very rude. She snatched the receipt from my hand after I signed it and had a rude demeanor. The food was good overall which is why this wasn't a 1 or 2 star review. Would I go back? No."}
{"text":"I recently had breakfast here with 7 colleagues, and while the food is always tasty, our service was really lacking. We went on a Tuesday morning around 8am, and there was barely anyone in the restaurant. However, our multiple servers still managed to mess up orders and fail to bring out basics like water for everyone. The food did not come out all at once and we had multiple items delivered that we hadn't ordered.  I did have the sunrise burrito, and it was solid. It comes loaded with brie and avocado, which is pretty difficult to mess up. I did end up with a free, extra plate of hash browns, and those were quite good. They are more like breakfast potatoes than hash browns, and I wish they would have been labeled that way on the menu so I would've ordered them.  Overall, the environment and food is nice, just disappointing that the wait staff couldn't get it together on a slow weekday morning."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab brunch.  I had the Cali Benedict which was OK.  I thought the side of breakfast potatoes were a little mushy and bland.  I would have liked the potatoes to be oven roasted instead to give them a nice flavor.   Better yet, a side of crispy pan fried hash browns would have been a better option with their breakfast dishes."}
{"text":"I hate to be the one with a 3 star review in a place full of 5 stars. But, honestly I think this place is way overpriced for what you get. I went, and was just not impressed. I felt like many of the breakfast meals they had on the menu were things I could make at home for a fraction of the cost. Now granted, this review is soley based on the breakfast. I never went for dinner. The wait to get into this place made me think it had to be amazing, and when we were seated I was excited to try it.   I don't even remember what I got there, which is rare for me to say. My boyfriend had the eggs benedict and he isn't hard to please. He didn't even eat it. He picked at it, but said it wasn't like anything he had ever tried, and just couldn't finish it.   We got the bill, and WOW.. I couldn't believe the price. That alone for such a bland meal was enough to make me never go back. I would still say to give the place a try though and see what you think. Maybe we just went on an off day or something. There are a lot of positive reviews, so maybe we just didn't order the right dish."}
{"text":"We drove out to Toast this weekend and had some empty tummies just waiting to try the delicious looking food from their coupons. Tip for ya, if you go for brunch like we did... get there EARLY!!! It was crazy packed outside! But it was a gorgeous day and the way was truly about the length that they said it'd be.   All the servers work together so service was fast and accurate. They were all courteous and the food was pretty tasty. My only thoughts are that for what you get it's a little pricey, but then again we are in Dilworth so I guess that's to be expected.  They have some interesting choices, so I'll probably head back, but it's not at the top of my list. Maybe next time I need to go with something sweet instead of healthy. We all know healthy can be pretty boring. Hence why I still gave this place 4 stars. I got the turkey scramble and it just reminded me of something I could have made at home. It was eggs, cheese and turkey scrambled together with a cup of fruit and some toast. I was pretty jealous when I looked around and saw the mountains of pancakes and stuffed french toast.   Ambiance was nice and lively, food was good, and it is just a nice way to start a Sunday."}
{"text":"Exceptional. Everything that was ordered at the table was amazing and the service went above and beyond. I normally go with a normal Mimosa for Brunch but the Champagne Punch was calling my name and it did not disappoint. Not to downplay the traditional Mimosa either because it's made with fresh squeezed OJ. I split the Avocado Benny with my daughter. The fruit cup on the side was fresh and after my meal I was a good full. The kids had pancakes and there is something special about those pancakes, can't pinpoint it but they were amazing, def a must try. The serving of Huevos Rancheros was super generous and according to Wife was great. The Lobster Scramble was passed around the table and OMG that smell was just heavenly. Definitely disappointed we don't have one of these restaurants in my area."}
{"text":"Toast is hands-down one of the best brunch spots in the city! Amazing service, wonderful menu items, and you can spot a Panthers player every now and then! I love taking visitors here on Sunday!"}
{"text":"Average breakfast. Could have made this meal at home. Cali Benny was requested as over medium and was extremely over hard. Waiter did not seem to care about table. French toast and pancake were both doughy. Fried egg was the size of a golf ball"}
{"text":"Sunday morning is always a tough time to dine.  We had a group of three.  We're seated pretty promptly, drinks brought quickly.  And then we waited fifteen minutes for our order to be taken.  The server Frank rang In our order and brought the ticket back to the table (rang in at 11:10am).  Forty minutes in I inquired into our food, as several tables around us were getting theirs.  The server Frank gave attitude and said his was normal, and it would be five more minutes.  Fast forward to Noon when we inquired again and every employee was combative, trying to blame it on being busy.  Employees took no responsibility, showed no empathy, and got argumentative, so we walked out.  I'm a pretty easy going guy--I never send food back, and treat employees with respect.  If you can't make an omelette in FIFTY minutes, you need to find a new gig.  A table of people ahead of us had to get their food to go for the same reasons.  Ridiculous.  TLDR: Ridiculous wait.  Rude and unhelpful staff who got combative. Walked out. Not going back."}
{"text":"Terrible. We went in a Tuesday morning, while it was slow the service was just ok. The food was not. Soggy \"stuffed French toast\" cold sausage, burnt bacon, and don't even get me started on the so called \"sausage gravy\". Manager took the French toast off, never brought back a check, we had to ask for the itemized copy that we never got, because it would require deleting our payment and re-running it. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"An amazing brunch place! Mimosas are made with fresh squeezed orange juice and reasonably priced. Wait staff is accommodating and friendly. Offered us an outside seat to avoid a wait. Probably the best hash I have had and delicious biscuits and gravy. Would highly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"Great service great food everything tasted wonderful had the stuffed French toast with cream cheese and strawberries we also have the avocado egg Benedict great flavor wonderful."}
{"text":"Wow, we went here for the first time last weekend and there will definitely be repeat visits.  We had an amazing breakfast consisting of an omelet, blueberry pancake, toast, biscuit and gravycomplimentary cornbread and apple butter. This is going to be our go-to breakfast/brunch place."}
{"text":"Foods good but not amazing...don't know why there is always a ridiculous wait?? Expand? Add another location..."}
{"text":"This place was great! I got an omelet with a side of bacon. The food was fantastic and their bacon tasted smoked which was delicious and unique. The oranges juice was phenomenal, it was REAL and FRESH which is very difficult to find around these parts. The only complain I have is when we wanted our check it took a really long time to grab someone to ask for the check, we waited for a long time and someone would come over and ask if we wanted more water and as soon as you answer no, they run away and you lose the opportunity to get the check. We were surprised no one brought it or even asked if we wanted it. But other than that, great experience."}
{"text":"This has become our go-to weekend breakfast spot in Huntersville. The food is always amazing and the quality of service is truly remarkable. One of the most efficiently run businesses you will ever encounter. The fresh orange is really good and the northwestern herb and goat cheese omelet is my favorite menu item so far. Breakfast for 2 usually runs us $30-$40, but as with most things, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The food was great, best eggs Benedict I've ever had. The service was prompt, polite, and very helpful, and The view is amazing. I have nothing bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast spot.  Really friendly and helpful staff.  Sits over a pond, nice scenery.  I built my own omelette.  Fresh, tasty and fast. They have a full bar and lots of brunch drinks. Seems like a good place for a date. Free parking close by.  I enjoyed going here for breakfast. I came during the week so there wasn't a wait but I can imagine how busy this place gets on the weekends. I'd gladly go back again."}
{"text":"I been to Toast a handful of times, and each visit has been very pleasant.  They are always so happy to see you and the food is wonderful."}
{"text":"I had no idea Toast made its way up to Davidson, but boy was I happy to visit this past weekend! I love this place - great service.  Yummy food.  Always a long wait but pretty worth it."}
{"text":"Toast is one of my favorite lunch spots in the whole area. It never disappoints! Perfect setting right on Main Street in Davidson, very nice wait staff, and great food! Will continue to visit Toast on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Great food and service consistent with the other restuarnts in this chain! Added touch of  and enclosed area with views of the lake is nice because you can get the outdoor effect without the heat or cold.  Fresh items and a few interesting creations always on the daily special menu."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite places for brunch. I come almost every weekend. Staff is friendly and prompt. Food is great! My favorite thing on the menu is the Cali Benny. Perfect every time."}
{"text":"Back again.  I order simply. I want eggs. I want toast. I want coffee.  I eat eggs almost every day. I know what two scrambled eggs looks like. Unless they use grade small eggs, this was not 2 scrambled eggs. Toast was warm, but not brown. C'mon man!   I just can't bring myself to come here anymore. I'm over it."}
{"text":"Been to this location many times as it is close to home and our expectations have always been met. The servers are very friendly and attentive throughout your whole meal, not just up until the food is delivered. This restaurant uses a model that every server is your server so there is always someone available should you need anything or have any questions.     Now for the food: everything that  I've gotten has been excellent! I really enjoy the flapjacks and of all the flavors the chocolate chip and raspberry walnut are by far my favorite. The stuffed French toast with strawberries is also delicious and each of those comes with a generous side of thick sliced bacon.      Finally, the coffee is some of the best I've ever had. it's a dark roast which I don't normally like but it is amazing. Overall the meal is well worth the money for the quality and experience!"}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions about this restaurant. Within 10 minutes of being sat we were asked at least five times if we were ready to order (we were not obviously, because I just sat, we were catching up and we also each had children under the age of two to tend to!). Once we finally did order we weren't really checked on but at least there are many waitstaff walking by. However having said this, the food did come out rather fast and my chicken sandwich was positively delicious. The pasta salad I ordered was kind of bland and my friend ordered the kids mac & cheese for her 1.5 year-old and it appeared to be kraft. But my sandwich was that good that I will give them another try!"}
{"text":"A great place to eat. I thought it would be a wait for a table but we got one right away at noon. The waiter was attentive, when I voiced a complaint, he fixed it right away. Food is delicious! My wife had the raspberry/walnut pancakes, which were unusually good. I had the French toast sandwich (egg and cheese in middle) which was a new treat for me! Also I had a side of hash browns-rather disappointing. I don't think they were brown enough. Still, the sandwich was so, so, good! And the tea was good also."}
{"text":"I eat at Toast (now known as Famous Toastery) in Davidson on a regular basis. I was there for dinner last week and again tonight and it's been a while since I've posted a review about them, so here I am.  Last week I had the Lobster BLT. Outstanding. Fresh Maine lobster, delicious bacon, good lettuce and tasty tomatoes on a ciabatta roll with a garlic aioli, with a side salad. A simple but elegant and perfectly constructed sandwich.  Tonight I had one of the mainstays of their dinner menu- Chicken Marsala. All of the elements of the dish were well prepared, resulting in a spectacular dish: Boneless chicken breast in a Marsala wine sauce with mushrooms. A classic. It comes with either sauteed spinach and ricotta ravioli or green beans and mashed potatoes. I always go with the spinach and ravioli. A small loaf of bread for dipping, and I became a member of the clean plate club (as usual).  I would normally have ordered one of their salads- I like a small wedge salad most of the time- but I wasn't super hungry and I didn't need one tonight.   Another fine meal!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place!! The staff is wondering and we love Korrinda Bowne! My husband is obsessed with the mac and cheese and I love the Ruben! ! Great place!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar.  Service good.   I had the black bean burger with fruit.  It was tasty.   The burger did fall apart while eating it but I didn't care.    My girl had a hamburger wrap with fruit.    Good experience and will be back.  Better than other locations."}
{"text":"Do not get the breakfast quesadilla if you don't like corn. Sausage gravy is amazing. Great service and you can alter the menu and drink alcohol for brunch. Amanda is awesome.  I like the country Benedict with avocado.  Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"We eat here about every weekend. The food is very good and service is awesome. We had the western omelette with potatoes and toast. They always bring you cornbread with Apple sauce even before you order. They say \"every server is your server \" and that is true. We never wait for our coffee cups to be refilled. They take your order using tablets, your order goes to the kitchen before they leave your table. A very good place for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Was SO Excited when I heard the new restaurant was opening. The first time I went it was just blah, I chalked it up to being new. The second time was just worse. I will go to Cafe 100 moving forward. It's way better!!!"}
{"text":"So far so good...servers were prompt and nice. Menu is decent. Omg food was amazing.. French Toast..shrimp and grits..avacodo omelette...yes!! Must return"}
{"text":"Great new family breakfast spot. The servers need a bit of fine tuning when it comes to getting everything right, but nothing major was missed. Everyone on the staff was friendly, the food was good, and the location is great. The atmosphere inside the restaurant is very nice as well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Not my best  breakfast experience. I had the Combo from the Griddle with the flapjacks. I guess I was expecting more of a buttermilk pancake and this was more of a bland cake. The entree comes with one egg and an additional egg cost $1.99? The best part of this meal was the bacon. That's not saying much when the side of bacon is the star of the meal.  I may come back but I won't order this entree."}
{"text":"I often hear people talk about Famous Toastery and was finally able to see what all the fuss is about!! Loved it!! I had the combo (French toast, one scrambled egg, and two turkey sausage patties). The atmosphere is super cute and perfect for a breakfast or brunch date. The portions are great and the staff is very friendly and attentive!! Definitely looking forward to coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"I came here for Sunday brunch with my husband and expected the same experience that I had at the university location. I will say that the vibe is completely different. It's more modern than the down home feel of the university restaurant and I really liked the feel. We were seated within about 10 mins although it appeared as though we arrived right before the crowd. After being seated, Fallon waited on us, although multiple staff members periodically checked on us as they all serve all tables.   I ordered the crab roll and pesto pasta salad. My husband ordered the chorizo, spinach, and feta cheese omelet with a side of grits that were AMAZING!! We weren't offered cornbread and apple butter at the university location but we had it at this location and it was excellent! I've never had that combination but can't wait to go back for more! The food was good and seasoned fairly well. I added more seasoning to my pasta salad but left feeling satisfy aha pleased with our experience!! I would recommend this restaurant because of it's reasonable prices, good food, and great service!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service!!! Have been numerous times and every time it has been beyond awesome!  It's the one place that my entire family can happily eat at because with their wide selection menu, even a picky eater (or someone with dietary restrictions) can find something they will love! HIGHLY recommend and would give 10 stars if it was allowed!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the race is about this place.  Food is bland at best.  If you are looking for good old buttermilk pancakes go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday morning for Father's Day breakfast with my family. When we walked in around 9:15am we were immediately greeted and seated by the kind host. He took us to our table and didn't mind the last minute request to sit in their sunroom to enjoy the beautiful views of the boardwalk. The service was quick from the drink order to the order placing, especially considering that it was a holiday and they were nearly full. This expeditious service is a sure fire plus when you're hungry.   As we waited, our waiter brought out a basket of cornbread with an apple jam. It was quite delicious and was satisfying without being overly filling. As a table, we ordered: The New Yorker with grits and wheat toast; spinach, mushroom and gruyere omelet with homefries and sourdough toast; the runner's omelet with homefries and wheat toast; and a kids order of pancakes with bacon and homefries.   Within ten minutes everyone's food was out . We simultaneously dug in. Unfortunately, I didn't get to try anything off of anyone else's plate but my spinach, mushroom and Gruyere was pretty good. I will say I felt like it was missing something (maybe a sauce of some sort or an extra element to impart more flavor). It was still well cooked inside and out with plenty of filling. The homefries were really the star for me, packed with flavor and a generous portion to boot. They were cooked to the perfect texture.  Definitely noteworthy!! I also ordered the sourdough toast which was absolutely fabulous. It was definitely good sourdough not some prepackaged garbage.   Everyone else enjoyed their entrees. Not a drop was left on anyone's plate and we were all stuffed. Best of all, everything came up to $43 and some change. Not bad at all.   I will definitely be back soon and plan to make this my go to breakfast place.   As we were leaving, I had food envy when I saw a man eating a bagel and lox. (Didn't even see that on the menu). The piece of lox was absolutely beautiful! That will be my next conquest"}
{"text":"Very good and savory meatloaf. The macncheese was delicious as well with good flavor. The sweet tea was to die for and service was excellent. Yes I return."}
{"text":"I use to always go to the Dilworth location so I wasn't planning on leaving a review since the food there is always yummy , but I was highly disappointed with this location.    One , didn't know we could seat ourselves , had to ask because no one greeted myself or my coworker . Picked a table in the corner on the backside of the restaurant, waited a good ten minutes before anyone came to serve us. I saw 2 waiters pass us by 3 times and no one smiled , asked if we needed help, notttthhing. Finally, a nice lady asked if we had anyone help us, noticed her section was on the other side so I'm still wondering why the tall, Ken Barbie wannabe didn't wait on us and we were obviously in his section .   I absolutely despise bad customer service . These 2 stars are solely for the nice server that did take care of us .   I ordered the smoked sausage omelet, eh ... no flavor , tasted like carton eggs and it was a bit cold . Wheat toast was burnt , fruit smelled funny (yes, it had an odor) so I didn't eat it . Also ordered a Cobb salad to go bc I knew that little $11 omelet would have my tummy growling by 3pm ... What's going on Famous Toast? Nothing taste the same . My coworker however enjoyed her special ... so I don't know did I not order the right meals ? Doesn't even matter when you aren't acknowledged in the first place .   Won't be visiting this location again ,  cost too much for the negative experience, and bland food ."}
{"text":"Toast was the families go to Brunch spot on Sundays.  Being from the north were there is great diners all over, it was a challenge to find a good breakfast place.  I live in Northern CLT and it is about a 20 minute commute is always worth it at Toast.  Not to mention I love the small town of Davidson.  Toast was first introduced to me when they were in Huntersville.  i have been there atleast once a month since.    They all around have a great breakfast menu and are usually fast and friendly staff.  The service is great.  All staff works together so you are not just waiting on one person.   They also serve bread with apple spread at every table.  This is great to occupy the 3 year old until she gets her pancakes!"}
{"text":"I was there the other morning with my brother and son. The manager was awesome the staff was great the food was amazing. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"All of the locations are great. I really enjoy the omelette with the goat cheese and arugula. Wonderful establishment for breakfast and brunch."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite breakfast places. Went for the first time today and had an excellent experience. We only waited 15 mins! Best part- we got our food literally 10 mins after ordering. My boyfriend and I said that was the fastest we've ever gotten our food at any restaurant! The food was great and so was the experience!"}
{"text":"This Toastery location has become one of our favorites since they opened, and my husband and I eat here for Saturday breakfast at least once a month.  This is a popular place and so there is often a wait, but waits are generally short.  I usually get the crepe special.  It's always good, no matter what berry or fruit filling they're featuring.  They do scrambled eggs with cheese right, with a good portion of cheese that is nicely melted and mixed perfectly into the eggs.  I prefer their sausage over their bacon, as their bacon is thick, but too sweet for my taste.  The sausage patties, on the other hand, are both savory and spicy.    They also feature breakfast bowls on weekends, and their chorizo, egg, potato, and sausage gravy bowl is divine.  We've had it with both fried and scrambled eggs, but we both prefer the latter, as scrambled eggs pair so well with their sausage gravy.  The potatoes are cut into approximately one inch chunks, and pan fried.  The chorizo is finely ground and nicely crispy.  This bowl is absolutely yummy, and even if they don't have it featured, we've been able to get it regardless.    Toastery's premise is that every server is your server, and service is usually very good.  So you can ask anyone to assist you, and often two or more servers will stop by to just check on your table or offer more coffee.  That means that tips are also shared.  While espresso and cappuccino aren't on the menu, they have an espresso machine behind the bar, and will gladly make you a cup.  Their regular coffee is just ok (we prefer a stronger blend).  All in all, this is one of our favorite spots for breakfast in Huntersville!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to restaurant. Great food, casual atmosphere and good pricing. They also have gluten free options. Excellent service, everyone is your wait staff."}
{"text":"Oh my God I had the shrimp & lobster grits  It was delicious, thank you famous Toastery:)"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and the experience is always the same-fantastic. Always busy-have to wait and it's pleasant. The town is really scenic (college across the street and Mayberry Main Street shops). The wait is never an issue. We sat outside in the back courtyard. Warm autumn day-great food great coffee and just pleasant. It's always the same--fantastic."}
{"text":"Still delish (and busy)!! Service was great, my food was fabulously loaded with goodness and calories and I loved every bite.  Came around 10am and the wait was only about 10 minutes so not bad!   After trying lots of brunch spots close to home, I think we finally settled on Toast bring our go to spot.  Not too fancy, great food that tastes fresh and great service."}
{"text":"We love toast! Try the apple cinnamon pancakes... they are amazing. There's always a good crowd there... and the service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Our favorite new breakfast spot. The homemade orange juice is delicious!  Everything we have tried so far has been delicious, and the service is typically very good."}
{"text":"If you are looking for brunch this is definitely the place to go. Their French toast is the best as well as their specials! Get the sweet tea! You can fill your blood sugar rising but that's good! #lovethesouth"}
{"text":"I have been a fan since I first stepped foot in the Dilworth location. I have tasted most of the menu, but the Lobster roll is my favorite. Wait, maybe the crab cake Benedict is my favorite. Either way you can't go wrong just have a mimosa and decide."}
{"text":"Love Toast -- especially since this location is so close to where I live. Have never gotten anything I didn't like!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My favors weekend breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Food was nothing special, not much taste too it. Would of liked the waitress to check on us every so often. Wife's salad was the equivalent of a side salad at other restaurants. For the price and quality of the food I will not return."}
{"text":"OK so, here is the deal... I have been enjoying Toast and their delicious Breakfast, Brunch and Lunch for 5+ years, however this review is actually on the Dinner that they serve.  Toast (Davidson) is open Wed- Sat night for dinner.  For so long  my boyfriend and I would walk by and insist on trying it sometime, as we often walk right downtown from home to eat.  Oddly enough, it took us 3 years to try their dinner, and I am not sure why? We knew we loved their other meals, so why were we so apprehensive? I have a feeling we were actually worried we wouldn't enjoy their dinner menu as much, we didn't want to be disappointed, and we surely assumed it would be a bit overpriced.  Were WE wrong! The dinner menu is absolutely perfect, ranging from burgers, to seafood, pasta and more.  An additional prix fix menu is available for 19 dollars. WHAT A DEAL! the prix fix menu includes a dinner salad, an entree, and a delicious desert ( the cheesecake and frannies delight are our favs).  The Boursin Burger is a favorite for my boyfriend, and I will attest to the fact that these homemade burger patties are large, juicy and delicious!    This place is great for families, girls dinners, date nights, group dates, ANYTHING. PS- the best part is, their drink specials are great, and two of you can walk out the door with full bellies and a buzz for less than 50 bucks !"}
{"text":"First time going and was truly impressed. Great food and service. Everything was hot and freshly made including the juice. I ate an omelet off the breakfast menu and It was amazing."}
{"text":"I wasn't thrilled with this place.  I heard it's supposed to be a big hit, but I was pretty disappointed.  I ordered a Bloody Mary and a BLTA wrap with pesto.  I got fruit in the side.  The Bloody Mary didn't taste very good...it was bland and had a weird aftertaste.  It wasn't spicy at all.  The wrap had Gouda cheese on it, which normally I like, but it didn't go well with the other flavors and it was loaded...over loaded with lettuce.  More lettuce than anything.  The fruit was kind of hard.   The staff was nice, friendly, and attentive.  They always made sure we had what we needed.  Overall a bland experience and I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"A very good breakfast place. Very nice staff... And very good food...lot of varieties for breakfast.. and to top it off.. an awesome coffee.."}
{"text":"Just went into this location, sat down to wait to be seated. No one greeted or acknowledged that I was there, a couple came in behind me and was acknowledged and seated immediately. Needless to say I turned around and walked out. I DO NOT TOLERATE RACISM OF ANY KIND."}
{"text":"We went for the peanut butter and banana stuffed French toast. The bread was like thick white bread and left something to be desired. We're used to natural peanut butter so this tasted different. Not bad though. Good service."}
{"text":"The Davidson outlet of Toast is a complete success.  I don't eat dinner here very often, but for lunch or breakfast you will have a hard time going wrong at Toast.    The atmosphere is really nice, though it can be a bit loud for breakfast or lunch because the place is ALWAYS packed!    As for the food - I have had a lot of different items from the menu and I haven't had a thing that I didn't like.  For breakfast, I routinely order omelets.   They are full of fresh ingredients, and they are fluffy and cooked to perfection.  I am particularly fond of the roasted vegetable and mozzarella omelet.  Omelets are served with grits or potatoes (the potatoes are great!) as well as toast or an english muffin.  For lunch I have had tried all of the salads (the Cobb salad is particularly tasty), and I have also had a few of the sandwiches.  Again, everything has been really well done.    The service at Toast is also really good.  Quite simply, the place is run very efficiently.  On Sundays the place is swamped, yet they manage to get folks in and out of the restaurant in a reasonable amount of time - all without making anyone feel rushed.  I am particularly impressed with the teamwork that the servers put on display during brunch/lunch.  Your soda/water glass will never stay empty for long!  If you are looking for a lunch/brunch option in Davidson, then I would definitely recommend that you consider Toast."}
{"text":"We go h to this location all the time and the service and food is great. We love the  quinoa bowl."}
{"text":"Went to the Famous Toastery on Saturday for brunch. The food was great. The service was great and the place was packed. I had the corned beef and hash, it was delicious! Glad we are moving into Brayden to be closer to this place."}
{"text":"4 Pokestops within a stones throw. You can reach 2 if you sit on the patio. A lot of action around here.....oh, and try the The Bernie Omlette. Capers and salmon scrambled eggs."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I ordered the shrimp and grits they were really, really good. My daughter ordered a burger and it was super. I highly recommend this place...."}
{"text":"You could tell by the crowd that the food at this place had to be good. We had to wait for 20 minutes or so but it was definitely worth it. They seem to use quality ingredients and the service is great. I will definitely come back again sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Waited for twenty minutes and finally left. Worst service EVER. Thanks for ruining my morning. Won't EVER go back- will remind my patients and everyone I talk to that you guys suck will be a problem"}
{"text":"Food and service was rock solid, highly recommend the blueberry pancakes with warm real maple syrup. Music was sleepy, wish it contributed to an otherwise upbeat atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a bummer! We used to love Toast--- it was our favorite restaurant in Davidson. Recently returned to dinner on a Saturday night and left incredibly disappointed. We were a party of three and one person's entree never arrived, without acknowledgement from the owner/manager, who was standing next to our table! The wait staff was standing around chatting while we were waiting to order, and the table next to us was waiting for the menu. Really bad service. The food was pretty bad too. The Caesar salad lacked flavor and the crab cakes were as dry as can be. We didn't even want to try the dessert... We won't be back."}
{"text":"Famous Toastery has great ratings, so this will be the minority report. First thing's first - service was good. The staff worked as a team, but was Luke warm with its friendly level. Also, we sat and talked for a Long time and no one rushed us, granted I think they were about to close.  The food was not \"bad\", but it was okay at best. I just wanted a great waffle with strawberries. Been having a taste for it ever since my experience elsewhere. What I got was a doughy waffle with a couple of previously frozen (ewwww, Gross) strawberries and blueberries in one quadrant of the waffle over cheap whipped cream that was melted upon delivery. They didn't even put the powdered sugar over the entire waffle. Pitiful and half hearted effort from the chef. The actual waffle was one step up from Leggo my eggo.  Last, the dishes were sanitized, but not clean. You know how the dishwasher can do a bad job, leaving stuck on food particles? That was the case here. There was egg on my plate, spots on my silverware, and foreign objects in my water that had no ice and tasted poorly.  Long story short, I will not be returning here. Not sure what they're Famous for, but the food can't be it."}
{"text":"I attended a meeting here with the local BAR for breakfast. The staff was very accommodating  with our group, assisting with moving tables as the group grew and having patience taking orders as people arrived at various times. I ordered fruit and hash browns at the same time as others around me. I was the last to receive my food and my hash browns were luke warm at best. While they had a good flavor, someone obviously forgot my food when it was ready. I would've rather they made me wait and served hot food. Nevertheless, overall I think this is a great local place for a weekday breakfast."}
{"text":"Update 5.26.18 Definitely sliding down... The food is 'okay' (presentation and quality have gone down some - slab of quiche, thin pancake syrup, tons of separate plates on a tiny table for eggs, pancakes, grits, etc.) and the front of the house needs a major overhaul and retraining. The last few times we have been the wait staff has been confused at best. Today we sat for 15 minutes and finally flagged down a busboy to ask someone to wait on us; he said he would but proceeded to start cleaning off a table first. So I went inside and asked the hostess to send a server. When she came, she asked for our drink order and I told her we'd been waiting and were ready to order. I got a quiche and when she and the other server brought out food, mine was missing. I thought she went back to get it and my bf didn't get any syrup for his pancakes plus I needed another drink. When I flagged her down to ask if my food was coming a while later, she said, \"yeah, they made the wrong quiche\"... ok, thanks for telling me?! Every time we asked for anything we literally had to flag someone down. We had one guy ask us how we were doing after we were served. Also, I'm not sure it isn't a health code violation the way some servers carry the food and for a server to have long fake nails on the edge of your plate. Not sure we will be back for a while, too many other options. Definitely not worth the $. When I checked out, the little girl at the register asked, \"How was everything?\" so I said, to be honest, it's gone downhill. We were seated for quite a while and I had to come back in to flag down a server.\" All she said was, \"Oh, I'm sorry.\"  Again, this is not the first time we felt the service was lax but after this visit we verbally confirmed to each other we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I don't dislike Toast, but at the same point, I don't love Toast. Everything there is fine, but there's nothing, except maybe the stuffed French toast, that's amazing. The combo of half French toast or pancake and eggs might be the best value on the menu.  I feel like the majority of their items aren't worth their $10 and up price tag.  I also wish their mimosas came pulp free. The last time I ordered one, it was more orange pulp than juice.   I will say it's not a bad place to go for someone who hasn't been there before, but after that, I just want something different."}
{"text":"Good ole solid breakfast.  Nothing fancy or over the top but something for everyone from corned beef hash to French toast to a tofu omelet.  It gets busy on the weekends so you can expect a wait."}
{"text":"So excited! So excited!  It seems that I have my very own Toast! Well, it doesn't belong to me, but it's close to my house and I LOVE IT! This location is brand new, beautifully decorated, and staffed with awesome people.   It won't be long before this place is packed on weekends because the food is delicious!  I ordered the Mac and cheese, a decadent take on the classic dish. The Gruyere cheese is a nice touch. It comes with the most perfect roasted vegetables ever. I ordered it with a side of country ham...because diets are for weaklings.   Kidding. But yes, I needed some protein. All in all, it was great. My husband got his standard breakfast fare, and loved it. And I enjoyed a mimosa, one of the best ever, because they use freshly squeezed oranges! Need I say more!?   Try it out...or not...I may want to keep it all to myself ;)"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere, and a gem in downtown Davidson!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Everything came out really quickly, to-order, and fresh. Service was excellent & the staff was very personable. First breakfast dining experience since relocating & will definitely be back. The music though...it felt a little contrived and silly for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"SO GREAT!  Stumbled on this great little find for dinner and so happy we did!  Service was awesome and the sweet man asked if he could \"valet\" our baby stroller.  So thoughtful.  Everyone was just great.  Menu is amazing - I wanted one of everything.  :)  Love that they can do half portions - what a great way to try things!  I had a half of a California salad (I live in California so it was a must try!) and it was incredible.  I also had the crab cake appeteizer.  I NEVER order crab cakes out because I like how I make them but they were out of this world.  I'm craving them just typing this review!!  Hubby had the burger and said it was top 10 that he'd ever eaten.  Had a great glass of red wine (on special) and over all wonderful evening.  Would go back to this place in a heart beat.    GREAT job to Toast!  Love ya'll!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service. I do suggest trying to get there early, because the wait time can be a little crazy on the weekends. Overall, well worth the wait! The stuffed french toast is to die for."}
{"text":"We loved it. Tupelo was a nightmare wait time and I'm too hungry for that shit. It was busy, but we were seated immediately. Cute place, very quaint. Waitstaff was attentive and friendly. I had a mimosa, Frank had a Bloody Mary and he said it's the best he's had so far. Frank is a pain in the ass with his bloody Marys. So, I ordered the eggs Benedict with extra hollandaise sauce and it was delicious. They ask you how you want your eggs done with it and I asked for medium and they came a little bit overcooked but delicious nonetheless. They came with a choice of the usual and my fat ass has the homefries. They were good. Too. Frank had some type of eggs Benedict also but his came with tomatoes and onions and then avocado almost like it was a salsa. His eggs were perfectly cooked. He orders a side of fruit, boring fuck. Their coffee was delicious and I was very surprised. Nobody makes a good fucking cuppa coffee around here and I finally got one. Anyway the wait time was minimal for our food and we were in and out in the time it would've taken us to wait for that fucking table at the Tupelo Honey Café. But don't get me wrong I will get there eventually!! Toastery rocks and I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Went with family this time. Asked for eggs very dry. Were kind of dry. My wife's Greek salad was good, not great (according to her). Tomatoes weren't ripe, but the rest was good. Very fresh cucumbers. My son's cheeseburger was average. Service was excellent again. Very clean restaurant. Will try BLT or turkey sandwich next time. Still haven't figured out if this is a 4 or 5."}
{"text":"This is 5 star food. This is 5 star front-of-house service. Unfortunately, it took 50 minutes for our party-of-two to get our food.   My wife loved her mimosa and BLT. The omelette and breakfast potatoes were solid. The flavor and texture of the flapjack is perfect.   This is a 5-star experience once the kitchen works out the kinks."}
{"text":"First time here.  Food was excellent.  Service was excellent.  If you come, don't forget to try the Lavazza coffee(excellent).  Definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"I just took takeout of an omelette and toast. Never knew this would be so expensive. But the taste was good. And will definitely dine in some weekend."}
{"text":"Wasn't thrilled. Had Crab Roll with Cole Slaw as a side. No taste on either. My husband had eggs with a bagel. He said the bagel was very good. I think next time I'll go to Cafe 100."}
{"text":"Compote (French for \"mixture\") is made of whole or pieces of fruit in sugar syrup. These whole fruits are cooked in water with sugar and spices.  What I got was 4 blueberries and 3/4 of a strawberry in the middle of my waffle for $13 and a cold sausage patty. Not ideal. Not quality. Not worth the money.   My husband got a burrito - said it was OK.  Also, the waiters are completely oblivious. I had two male waiter walk into to me on both sides as they were talking to one another and not watching where they were going. No excuse me. No I'm sorry. Just kept going. Very rude."}
{"text":"So, breakfast was 5 stars, lunch was... A 2.5? :( They were out of macNcheese, the potatoes in the potato salad needed to be cooked longer, & there just weren't many options that appealed to me. I'll definitely go back for breakfast though"}
{"text":"Wow! I am very impressed! I ordered the strawberry cream cheese stuffed French toast, scrambled egg,  and sausage. Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and the staff was extremely nice. But, the tables were way too small. We had a party of four sat to a small table surrounded by similar table with parties of 4. The tables were a bit close for comfort. I now know what a stranger wants to do for vacation this year. When my food came, my plate had to sit a bit off the edge of the table, because there was simply no room. Also, the wait was ~an hour. Our brunch was definitely leaning more toward lunch by the time we sat. The glass is half full though, because during our wait we discovered there's a super cute pet store next door with adorable puppy pastries."}
{"text":"GREAT breakfast!! My wife and I eat there almost once a week and are never disappointed with the fast/friendly service and small town feel.  The omelettes, french toast, and breakfast burrito are all excellent and I really like their version of hash browns. The lunch menu is solid as well with tasty sandwiches and good pasta/potato salad.  If you're ever in the Davidson college area, definitely stop by early because there will be a wait later in the mornings."}
{"text":"Came here twice for breakfast on a trip down south. Excellent food and friendly staff. Both times I was waited on by Lexi who was very nice and offered up some cool ideas for things to do while I was in the area.  First day I had 2 eggs, meat and house fries with a side of french toast. The french toast was really good; a hint of nutmeg set it apart from any other french toast I've had.  The second day was special. I ordered the Cali benedict which layered poached egg, avocado and tomato on an english muffin covered in hollandaise. Also came with a choice of side. Just...wow.   Tasty food, welcoming staff and excellent coffee makes this a go-to breakfast joint if you're in the area. Highly recommendable!"}
{"text":"Toast is a great place for breakfast in the heart of Dillworth. I was happy to learn that you can bring you dog with you to the outside seating area.  Wait staff is very attentive and the breakfast menu is different then what you normally see. I tried the eggs and salmon, it was pretty darn good. There are other things on the menu I will want to try.  I sat at the bar and was quickly adopted into the local crowd."}
{"text":"Overrated place to the fullest extent. Line stays crazy extendo type long. One would think  it's gotta be worth the wait...Nah. Cracker Barrel is atomic bomb times better than this place. I ordered pancakes  here and only got a single flapjack. That was hilarious! I said to the waitress, \"You Left the S off my pancake.\"  Speaking of waitress's they are all pretty good and very polite. I like them, back to the food, it's not horrible in flavor...it's just missing something I can't place my thumb on.   Overall I would not go back to this place unless I got comped for it."}
{"text":"I went to the dilworth location a few years ago and I don't remember loving or hating it. My fiancé picked this spot for brunch. After a 40 minute wait, we were seated. My fiancé ordered a mimosa which had a weird neon orange color to it. He commented to me that he didn't think there was real orange juice in it but he finished it. We both liked the corn bread they brought out.   He ordered the left coast BLT with chips and I had the strawberry and cream cheese french toast. I typically don't do a lot of milk products but it came highly recommended. Maybe my hopes were too high. I just didn't love it. There were huge CLUMPS of semi warm cream cheese in it that I just scraped out. It also just didn't taste cohesive to me - it was like they toasted two pieces of bread, put cream cheese on it and pressed it together. My fiancé liked it and ate a decent amount of it. I ordered homefries instead of meat.  I really liked them and I appreciated the Texas Pete on the table. My fiancé loved his left coast BLT and said he would definitely get it again.   Service was decent but not great. They were super busy and there wasn't a lot of attention to detail. That being said, everyone who came by our table was generally nice. As we were leaving, I noticed a couple being seated at a table that had a small bowl on it with half used butter and pieces of chewed gum in it. This is an example of what I mean when I say there didn't seem to be attention to detail.   This isn't my favorite spot but it's not the worst, either. My fiancé likes it so I am sure we will be back but it won't be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. The waffles and pancakes is probably the best in charlotte. The orange juice is probably the best I've ever had price can be a little high but it's definitely worth it for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for breakfast. I ordered the biscuits and gravy. I noted that there was no visable sausage,m but they tasted good, anyway. My wife ordered the scrambled eggs and hashbrowns.  The hash browns are really homefries. They were barely warm. Still and all, wer would still go back as the patio ambience was just so good."}
{"text":"Great selections . Had breakfast . Fast and friendly service I had the sunrise burrito and it was exceptional !"}
{"text":"Great food.  A fun-place. Friendly, helpful staff."}
{"text":"On college tours and stopped here on a recommendation from a local.... Glad we did!   Super fast, friendly service.  SO friendly... From host to server.  They even give you a cup of coffee to go if you'd like... And, let's say maybe you forgot to take said cup with you and come back looking for it, they'll give you a fresh one and do it with a smile on their face!! Crazy nice!   Delicious, fresh food.  My daughter had the BLT with avocado and I had the arugula salad special.  We were both very happy!   A bit on the loud side, but in a good way.   Makes me wish I lived closer  :-)"}
{"text":"Buddy's met up with here for breakfast, place was Nice, looked like they had a juice bar there you can eat at. I ordered a plate that consisted pouched eggs with avocado and feta cheese on top o believe it was called the ranchero if I remember, It was really good. Best orange juice I have ever had, literally fresh squeezed oranges for goodness sake, great place!"}
{"text":"To pricey! Everyone is your server and only half of them work. I would be passed if I had to share my tips with a slacker! And quantities of food are like the sample at Sams club."}
{"text":"Well worth the experience.  We like being able to eat outside on the sidewalks of main street in Davidson.  This place is a great fit for this cozy little town."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning based on favorable Yelp reviews. It did not disappoint! First off our server was super welcoming and explained the \"any server is your server\" policy. We had a tough time narrowing down our food choices. In the end we both went with omelettes. Mine with spinach, mushrooms and a smoky Gruyere, his a made to order. Fresh squeezed orange juice and coffee that tasted great when just black. Had we been in the area for another morning would have definitely gone back. Plenty of seating and some good 50's rock and roll music to listen too."}
{"text":"We are locals that had started enjoying Toast (and bragging about it to other locals) on a fairly regular basis.  We had enjoyed great meals just about every time we visited.  However, like other posters, it was confusing to have three or four people coming by the table.  Also, one reviewer referred to the female manager as 'a bitch'.  That's a bit stronger word than I would have used, but I knew immediately who she was talking about.  During our last visit many months ago, my wife's hamburger that was ordered medium rare was delivered with a cold, bleeding center.  No big deal, we flagged down one of the multiple people that had visited our table and asked them to cook it a bit more.  We were very reluctant to do this because it had boursin cheese on top and we just didn't know how it would come back.  It came back medium well with no pink in the center.  The aforementioned female manager came by to see how things were and we expressed our disappointment.  She explained to us that the cook had recently moved here from New York and '...he was still learning how to cook for people in North Carolina.'  Huh?  After this comment sank in for a few minutes, it got me a bit ticked off.  My wife and I have both eaten in New York plenty and they cook meat the same way we have requested it all over the country, including North Carolina.  The manager also told us that she checked the burger when it was first sent back and that it was cooked the way it was ordered.  Well, admittedly, we asked for medium rare and that isn't a long way from rare, but we got extra rare.  Anyone would have sent that burger back, I think.  So, according to this 'manager', either the cook prepared the burger correctly and we were wrong, or we were idiots from North Carolina that didn't know how to order our food, as far as we could tell.  Since that visit, we have never returned and we will not go back as long as that woman is there.  We have stopped bragging about the place and now, instead, relate our last experience.  Others have shared similar opinions with us.  Recently, at Christmas in Davidson, we were cruising the food vendor tents and saw her manning the Toast tent.  Too bad, we would have loved to pick up something there, but there was no way I was going to give that woman any of my money.  Greg S."}
{"text":"I have eaten here at least 10 times over a year for both breakfast and lunch. I have not had a bad or even an average experience. Each meal and service has been Top~Notch"}
{"text":"Great Food, Horrible Service.  I had heard so many great things about the food so decided to drive from Charlotte to the Fort Mill location to check it out. As soon as we walked in we noticed no one was there to tell us where to sit. My party stood there for a few minutes until finally I asked the woman behind the register if we just sat ourselves. She replied that we did so we found a table and waited for our server. When our server came around to taking our orders I mentioned that we didn't have any silverware. He said he would be back to bring us some. When a different person brought us our food, I again mentioned that we had no silverware and that our waiter had forgotten to bring it back. She brought us silverware and refilled my coffee. We never saw our waiter after he took our order. Drinks were not refilled and no one inquired if we needed anything for the remainder of our visit. After we were all done eating, we waited for our check for about 20 minutes.  It never came.  Walked back up to the register and when the cashier asked for my check I told her we never got one. I told her we had not seen our waiter since he took our initial order. She looked at me blankly and asked where we were sitting. I showed her the table and she looked on her computer and just blurted out the total. No apology, no explanation, nothing. I told her I needed to split up the bill and I went through the items and paid my portion. The other person in my party paid for their portion and we promptly left vowing to never to return again!!!!  It doesn't matter how good your food is, if the service sucks- you've lost a customer. In this case, you lost 4."}
{"text":"Visiting friends in North Carolina they gave us some options for breakfast including here and flying biscuit. They have never been to either. Well great I love trying new places so I was pumped. We picked this place after looking at the menu. Unfortunately wish we would of tried flying biscuit instead. We waited probably 15 to 20 min no big deal on a Sunday I'd say that pretty good. Ordered the crab cake eggs Benedict with a side of sausage gravy and biscuits. Others ordered a corn beef hash eggs with a pancake and then just other standard breakfast food eggs toast potatoes etc. We had to ask for refills of water at about 45 min in because our server never returned. This is when they informed us it was team service but there were plenty of servers standing around talking to each other but not one approached our table to update us on our food or refil our waters for 45+ minutes. We waited for probably an hour before our food came. All of the food except the corn beef hash came out cold. I dont know about you but cold eggs yikes. So the food all had to be returned. Then we had to wait for the food to be remade probably another 20 to 25 minutes. They did comp us half our bill hence the 3 stars. We heard them comp at least one other tables bill so needless to say others were also unhappy. I'd say it was average, I wouldnt return if ever back in the area."}
{"text":"This is a great place for weekend brunch. They have all the basics, with a bit of a twist. My favorites are the Griddle combo classics, also enjoy the reasonably priced mimosas. They come in all different flavors and are absolutely delicious! The staff is great, the atmosphere and Decor is modern and trendy. The place is abuzz with activity, but not so loud that you cannot hear the person sitting across from you. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was my 1st visit to Toast of Davidson since Toast Cafe of Huntersville closed. I really enjoyed Toast Cafe.  I loved how it was located in an all too small house, especially for the crowds that would arrive on the weekend.  This was my local place.  It was charming.  After my visit to Toast of Davidson, I feel the charm is gone.     Atmosphere -  Small downtown setting, busy, crowded...it feels like this site used to be a local bar...maybe it once was one.  Food - On this visit I had the Greek Omelet, which consisted of spinach, onion, tomato, and feta cheese.  My order came w/ a side of toast and homefries.  This dish w/ an ice tea came to $13.48 + tip.  While to start they still bring you corn bread with an applesauce like spread (tasty to eat on its' own), I had a little sticker shock when leaving.  It was good...but not that good and I really did not feel like I ate a lot of food.      Service - Service is still excellent at Toast.  On this visit the waitstaff appeared professional (a bunch of 20 somethings) as compared to the teenagers that seemed to make up most of the staff at the last location.    Overall - I still like Toast, I just don't LOVE it anymore.  Maybe it's the new location or the pricing or maybe it was just a different time back then.  I was young, you were different...its me...not you.    Toast, it was fun while it lasted."}
{"text":"First of all don't try to come on a Saturday unless you have time to wait. The lines are telling.   I will say that's the thing I am most impressed with is that they make a perfect French omelette. That means there's no brown anywhere to be seen. Brown food is ugly.    I had eggs Benedict. The eggs were a little challenged, little bit more white gunk to my liking. I think next time I'll just ask for them to be cooked the shade more. Otherwise they were delicious.  Big fat juicy potatoes. Be careful, the hot sauce poured out from the bottle,  mouth on fire.  I will certainly come back and try to eat through their menu."}
{"text":"Actually very good. Had an English muffin breakfast sand which it was very good. The breakfast potatoes were a little bland but it was nothing a little hot sauce couldn't fix. The waiters were very attentive. Very cool everyone is considered your waiter."}
{"text":"Great little place for brunch. The line was out the door so we figured it had to be worth the wait. Had the combos with french toast and eggs. Food was great and service was friendly and quick. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"There is only one reason why I'm not giving this my first 5 star restaurant review and that is because of ambiance... namely the acoustics and the teeny tiny tables.  It's very difficult to comfortably fit four at a table of four and it is always, no matter the time of day, difficult to hear the person across from you.  If the restaurant could fix the acoustics so I could hear my tablemates, the food earns and deserves 5 stars.  I have eaten both breakfast and lunch at Toast (Famous Toastery) probably 15 times.  The food is consistently above par.  The french toast and flapjacks are both generously sized and served with warmed syrup.  The blueberry-stuffed with delightful.  Omelettes are creative and delicious, my favs so far:  The Avocado (avocado/tomato/bacon/parmesan); Boursin (tomatoes/bacon/boursin cheese); MBS (mushroom/bacon swiss); SMG (spinach/mushroom/gruyere) and my next to try is the Tofu (tofu/spinach/roasted red pepper/artichoke).  The breakfast Combo is your choice of french toast or flapjacks, one egg any style and bacon or sausage.  My meal of stuffed french toast, scrambled egg and bacon may have been the perfect breakfast.  Lunchtime is just as good, too.The Left Coast BLT (bacon/lettuce/tomato/brie/avocado) is my go-to sandwich.  Sides are a choice of pasta salad, potato salad, cole slaw or chips.   I might choose to say that prices are little high, breakfast is in the $9.99 and $10.99 range which is maybe $2.00 more than most places charge for breakfast.  But in this case I'm going to have to point out that since the food tastes significantly better than places costing $7.99 or $8.99 that I'm ok with that.  Service is usually extremely fast since servers help with all tables.  There's often some confusion for new to Toast people over whether they pay at the table or pay at the cashier station but it always works out.  If you've not been before and you plan to go for lunch you need to be there by 12:00 PM or the seats will all be filled.  Breakfast during the weekday is steady but busy and it's usually safe to say you'll get a table.  Breakfast on the weekends, good luck, everyone flocks there to enjoy the beautiful Town of Davidson ambiance, delicious food and our often beautiful weather.  Go if you haven't been and go again if you have!"}
{"text":"Please answer your phone! We love your food and want to order it to go but have called two different numbers 5 times and no one answers. Very sad!"}
{"text":"The food was ok and the service was good but I can't justify the prices. It was quite expensive for the quality of what we had. We sat at a two-person table and kept getting bumped into. I was really ready to go by the time we finished. I believe the owner was there, opening the door for every customer. All of the servers help at every table. That's an interesting concept and we never waited long for anything we needed. Overall, I just wasn't impressed with the food, even before the $40 bill. Not in my budget for breakfast for two if that's what it will be again."}
{"text":"This is TRULY my favorite brunch spot in the city. It's not super fancy with beautiful decor like the other well known brunch spots in Charlotte, but it has great food and great service. Something about their food reminds me of being home on Saturday mornings and waking up to breakfast already made by my mom. Sigh.   Every time I've been here the wait has been shorter than 30 mins, including on weekends. The food also comes out pretty quickly. I'm pretty traditional with my food choices so I stick to the eggs, pancakes, and bacon. The pancakes are soooo good! I love that they keep it original and don't try a bunch of fancy recipes! What's that thing they say, \"If it ain't broke...\"  My favorite thing about this place is the serving style. Everyone is your waiter and I believe that's truly a best in class style that almost guarantees great customer service."}
{"text":"This was my first (of hopefully many) visits to the Belmont Famous Toastery. We'd been to the Charlotte locations before, so we were excited about Belmont getting one.   I worried about going on the opening weekend, especially with a hungry four year old who gets hangry sometimes, but getting there early guaranteed no wait. There were plenty of super friendly staff waiting to help us, and the neat thing about FT is that every server is your server. So we had our order placed, drinks out, and food on our table in literally no time.   The French toast was light with a bit of crisp, the bacon was thick, and scrambled eggs were fluffy. I peaked someone's breakfast burrito from a few tables over and that's what I'll try next. That thing looked thick, just like I like em.   I'll be back soon. You should go too. Everyone in Belmont needs the Famous Toastery in their life."}
{"text":"Awesome sausage gravy!! Very prompt and friendly service. We will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Service was very, very good. I was hoping the food would live up to the wonderful service we got, however, it was lacking. It just didn't seem like anything \"special\". The best thing I had werethe potatoes. They were good. My omelette was ok.  The sausage used in it tasted really good. It has ALOT of sautéed onions in it. More than I would have preferred.  All in all it was ok experience, but I wouldn't rush back to eat here."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! They have some of the best mimosas I've ever had. Their hashbrowns are the chunks of potatoes (home fries) instead of the scattered thin chopped up hashbrowns that I prefer, but they were so well seasoned and perfectly cooked that I still loved them. The Eggs Benedict is to die for! Perfectly cooked poached eggs with just the right amount of hollandaise sauce. I will definitely be ordering that again!"}
{"text":"Food service was good kinda expensive for breakfast 32.00 for eggs toast potatoes and grits for 2 . Would have not cared but as I was watching the server get tables ready he pulled out a Dirty towel from apron and the wiped off several tables with out using any sanitation solution then put towel back in apron and preceding doing it several more tables as I had to wait for my cc to be returned then finally had to track down my cc I finally found it happen to see manger as I left and told him my concern as we watched another server do the same thing I was so discussed as we watched I don't believe the manager cared but this is unacceptable for sanitation I will never be back because it was so gross and is stuck in my mind..gross..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast restaurant in Charlotte.  My two menu favorites are the eggs Benedict or any of their great omelettes. The service is fantastic and the food always arrives timely and hot.  In my opinion, you can't ever go wrong eating here!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying Famous Toastery (FT). I've heard such great things about this particular location so I had no hesitation when a friend invited a few folks out to brunch.   The location is extremely beautiful, sits on a sort of man made lake, ducks, paddle boats and tons of cute shops. It was such a beautiful day to sit outside with the sun shinning & perfect weather (finally).  The interesting thing about FT from my experience is I don't believe you have just one waiter/waitress which was a gift/curse. Our initial waiter brought out water and took drink orders. We ordered the Jack Belinni's (I highly recommend) and the Rum Mimosa's which are more on the sweet side. Drinks were made nicely but of course could have been stronger lol but don't we all think that way?  After getting our drinks, it took maybe 20 mins for someone to come back to take our order. We had to ask a waiter that was servicing another table for our waiter and long/behold our new waitress came to take our order. After placing our order of Shrimp & Grits which were so well made & delicious. Think the chef was a bit heavy handed on the cheese but I ate around it still good.  Eventually the bus boy came out and took our plates and yet again we're all looking for our waiter/waitress to order another round of drinks. Eventually someone showed up, took our order for another round which never came out. We literally had to go find our waiter and ask for an update. We were told it wasn't put in by the waitress so again we waited. The entire 2.5hrs we were there we had 2 drinks because of us constantly waiting.  Overall, FT is  stars but I can't over look how they over stretch & extend their wait staff because it causes their service to suffer which is why I put . A recommendation would be to give one server a large table and maybe a smaller one. A customer should never have to ask for their waiter/waitress 3 times."}
{"text":"The service was great and the Avocado Omelet was delicious! Lots of menu choices for a breakfast and lunch place. My friend got the waffle and that was also delicious."}
{"text":"Still celebrating my birthday! Trying out a new breakfast place and so far so great! Service is awesome! Every server is your server!"}
{"text":"I finally made it here for the first time recently. I would highly recommend it. My husband and I were lacking on sleep, but everyone was so helpful and nice.   I got the stuffed french toast with raspberry, blueberry, peanut butter, and banana. The menu was missing an Oxford comma so I thought they all came on it and it was amazing. My husband got the country benny which he thinks is close to one of the best Benny's he's ever had (he gets them a lot).   The service is better than any restaurant I've been to before. Every waiter/waitress will help you. They give you excellent recommendations.   We live close by, so this will probably be our new go to brunch place!"}
{"text":"More commonly known as \"Toast\" we decided  to try this for a brunch spot while my car was getting cleaned at the Dilworth Car Wash.  On Sunday morning the staff \"tag-teams\"  your table so the service was pretty good considering how crazy packed it was in there.  You can expect a wait and although the line looks like it is out the door and all the way to Gastonia, it moves fairly quickly.  The food was decent.  But hey, its tough to mess up breakfast food. For about $30 for the two of us we left satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"Came here solo one Sunday morning. Was sat instantly, which I like especially when I'm solo. I tried their banana nut flapjacks combo. Which was perfect. It came with a meat and eggs to my liking. Of course I did sausage as I don't eat bacon. It also came with eggs which I had scrambled with cheese. So delicious, the eggs weren't dry while I like. Also, I recommend getting the mimosas. It literally comes to the rim of the glass and taste so good. It's a little loud inside which is fine with me. Also, I wasn't exactly sure how to get in as it looked like a insulated patio. (Tip, it's the side door, lol) toast is fantastic and I highly recommend. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Met some friends for brunch here on a rainy Sunday morning. You have to get here early, as it fills up quick. Due to that reason, they pack in the tables. Literally on top of one another, which lends itself to a very casual country kitchen feel. Don't come here for a quiet meal and conversation.   As for the food, I had a runner omelette which was healthy but delicious. They always kept my coffee mug full and will even offer you a to go. I love toast for breakfast or lunch and will be back!!"}
{"text":"Sirs,          I just had the worst experience ever at this location. I won't go to Yelp or Twitter but Management needs to know. I live in Dilworth and have been eating at the bar there for some time on Saturdays. I went in today (10/11/'14), and two customers were seated at the bar. Every other place to sit at the bar was not wiped down and unclean. I sat alone at a table and when I was approached, I said, I usually sit at the bar but it is unusually nasty today. He had no comment and didn't go tell them to clean it up. I had a Southwestern omelette and it was very good. I ordered a tofu salad to go and was told he would put it in when I'm almost done. I never saw this young Black guy again. No water refills either. The male cashier came over and took my check and money. Another guy came and cleared the table. Still no to go order. Finally a young  lady walked by and I asked her to please check on my to go order because its been sometime already. I walked to the bar to wait and saw my waiter at a table eating. I mentioned to the lady  bagging the salad that he's sitting there eating, that's why I got no water. Still no one ever said a word about the long wait or the poor service. This was at 2 o'clock and the place was not busy. My check was $22 and I gave them $28. 30% tip for a truly horrible experience."}
{"text":"It's a bit on the pricy side. I enjoyed the great selection of mimosas.  I got the Pomegranate.  But $5 for a few swallows, hmmmmm... The food was tasty, couldn't go too wrong with what I ordered. I stuck pretty much to tradition. I got the combo with a plain pancake.  I will say this, the hash browns, more like potato chunks, were worth whatever exorbitant price I paid. I'd go back to just get a takeout of those and Polish them off in the car! However, I thought $22  breakfast bill for just me was a little over the top. Especially when I can go to Dennys down the street and for the same thing be paying under $10."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Atlanta staying with family from Cornelius and looking for a great breakfast before I hit the road.  We took a chance on Toast and were not disappointed.  This was a Sunday morning and they were packed, but ready for the rush.  The coffee was great.  We had the country eggs Benedict, French toast, grits.  They have the best grits EVER.  The service is fantastic.  Great vibe and hospitality."}
{"text":"Love this place for brunch. We come here every time my parents come into town! I usually just order the especially: haven't been wrong.   Pancakes and bacon, delicious! Sister in law ordered that.  The spouse loves the waffles. He gets them every time.   Love the atmosphere and they have outside seating when it's nice!"}
{"text":"One thing I don't like about Toast is the fact that they seat the regulars first, while those who have their names on a waiting list are taken care of last.  Our hostess explained to us how they must seat locals first, so while we waited 20 minutes and we were going to be next, there were 4 more groups seated before us who where locals, so our wait time was closer to 40 minutes.  Our server was good and the food is OK. Coffee is terrible."}
{"text":"Horrible service and it wasn't that busy also the mimosa looked like sea water and It was horrible! HOW do you mess up a mimosa! Bad experience overall."}
{"text":"Stop #3 on my Charlotte Sunday Brunch experiment, and we had already tried out the Toast of Ballantyne and were pleased. We arrived and were told 15 minutes or so, so we wandered off into the shop next door (Tuesday Morning, it's like a homemade Home Goods! Check it out!).   After we were seated, the Lady and I both ordered off the specials menu; I got the Crab Salad Rolls and she got a Crab quiche, and then I ordered the godly candied bacon w/ a spiced rub. Holy hell that was good.   Toast is a really cool concept (the whole \"everyone is your waiter\" thing), and in both locations they've delivered quality food in a timely manner. We'll continue to go back here, and I'll update my review once I see consistency. Nothing against you Toast, keep doin' what you're doin'."}
{"text":"Good food... tight & chaotic environment. They work as a \"team\" so you never have the same person helping (unless they're slow maybe?). I ordered the raspberry \"stuffed\" French toast which was more like raspberry jelly spread on toast. The bacon was good and eggs fine. It was brought out VERY fast after ordering. The thing I did not like was someone took my credit card off the table (I may have reached down into my bag when this happened) and it was like my card disappeared. If she said \"I'll take this for you\" I certainly did not hear her...and I'm not going deaf yet. Ten minutes later after asking the manager to find my card, someone that had not been serving our table gave me my receipt and card. While I'm glad this place runs a tight ship and serves good food fast- grabbing cards needs to be done a little more gracefully.  Ps. Like other reviewer states- the hashbrowns are HOME FRIES. Not shredded hashbrowns. I would not have ordered those if I had known. Chunky potatoes blah"}
{"text":"Went to Famous Toastery for the first time today. Food was excellent! Service and experience was exceptional! We will definitely be back.  Wait was about 25 minutes for Brunch today which wasn't too bad for noon on a Sunday. They turn tables quickly and the food looked delicious as we were waiting.  When we were seated, our server was super friendly and got our drink orders right away. When she took our food order she offered some suggestions which we appreciated and then she brought us some fresh cornbread with yummy homemade apple butter.  Fiancé ordered a blah blah blah omelette with cheddar and ham with a side of country potatoes and sourdough. Mama ordered a blah blah blah omelette as well with pepper jack, spinach, mushroom and onions with a side of grits and sourdough. I ordered the corned beef and hash crispy, with medium poached eggs, hollandaise on the side and sourdough. Also since it looked so good, we got an order of standard French toast with fresh strawberries and crispy bacon to share.  As they brought out our food, the food runner accidentally knocked my fiancé's sweet tea down. Now this could have made this first experience a very bad one. But they were super apologetic and though a little wet, we totally understand accidents happen. Also probably partially our fault for having the drink on the end of the table. The food runner didn't see the drink due to all the food he was carrying. Anyhow they cleaned up the floor immediately and brought us napkins to wipe down as well.  Being distracted with the spilling of the tea and the grumbling of our tummies, I forgot to take pictures of our untouched food but luckily I remembered before we finished devouring everything and will include that.  Now in regards to the food it tasted just as good as it looks. Fiancé liked his omelette so much that by the time I had finished buttering and putting strawberry jam on my toast, his omelette was gone. I sneaked a piece of his potatoes and they were seasoned really well and perfectly crispy. Mama really liked her omelette but said next time she'll order with cheddar since the pepper jack was a little spicy. Even then, she ate the whole thing. Though we didn't finish it since we had so much other food to try, we all had a bite of her grits and it was seasoned well and delicious with a little extra butter added into it. I think the French Toast is made with brioche and it was light and fluffy and just mMmMm! Usually you have to ask for the syrup to be warmed but here they automatically bring you warmed syrup.  My food was super yummy and I would definitely order it again. Eggs were poached medium so they weren't slimy but the yolk was runny and perfect. The corned beef was crispy on the outside and perfectly seasoned. Mama doesn't like corned beef and she thought it was excellent. I almost forgot about the hollandaise sauce since I asked for it on the side. But it brought the dish to an even higher level. Hollandaise was creamy and flavorful but light. I've ordered eggs benedict from many restaurants and their hollandaise sauce is probably the best I've had.  Now though we were not at all expecting it, the manager stopped by to apologize again for the spilling of the tea and comped our entire meal. We tried to tell him no and that we didn't expect that at all and would be happy to pay for our meals but he said it was already taken care of.  Since they did not allow us to pay for our check, we just left a great tip instead. We thanked our server again for the delicious food and great service. Also to thank their manager for going above and beyond for us. She said it was part of their culture to make sure customer experience was excellent.  If you haven't tried this place, just do it! It's worth the wait! You'll be one of many who will leave with a full tummy, happy taste buds and a smile on your face."}
{"text":"My friends and I joke that we spend half of our time in the classroom, and the other half at Toast. This place is good for everything: breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner! We come here for everything from a casual lunch to a celebratory birthday dinner. Some favorites: California salad, Cali-benny, chicken wrap... the list goes on. Also, being able to eat breakfast food all the way through 3 in the afternoon never hurt anyone :)"}
{"text":"If we're looking for a quick breakfast, this is our place to go. The food is always consistent, the staff is always friendly and usually if there is a wait to be seated  there are seats at the bar and your able to get right in! Great breakfast place!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! just moved from NJ and I will definitely become a regular here. Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly. The servers were very friendly. One of the waitresses heard I had never tried grits before and came out with a large bowl for me to \"sample\" on the house. So nice! Not to mention the grits were delicious!"}
{"text":"Some of the best French toast I've ever had, what a great way to start the day. Waiter was nice, food was amazing, and atmosphere was great. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Breakfast is average at best for the what you get and the service was very slow. I thought it was overrated. Denny's and IHOP are better choices"}
{"text":"We love this location. The food is fabulous but so is the staff - always professional and friendly.  Their mac n cheese is by far the best I have ever had!  The prices aren't bad for the area the menus has a good selection so you can have a gourmet type meal or just eggs and toast for a reasonable price. Try this place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best brunch food around. Wait is usually a little long on Saturdays but food is worth it. Unique breakfast items as well as old favorites."}
{"text":"My first visit here we sat at the  bar. The server ignores us mostly except to take our order. I got the lobster rolled and paid 15.99 for something I could have made better at home.  The lobster was chewy and portion was small too. The side was pasta salad which tasted like nothing at all. We could see the kitchen from where we sat and it was dirty not to mention the glasses sat on shelves with no mat under them. Don't go, McDonald's  breakfast is better and kitchen much cleaner."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for breakfast and I can't wait to try lunch and dinner.  I've never been treated so wonderful from start to finish.  The food was fabulous!  I had corn beef hash and eggs.  Their menu is great.  Everything was fresh and beautifully prepared.  Loved the look of the restaurant.  Deserves five stars!!  Will be back with family and friends!!"}
{"text":"We have been here so many times and always have a great experience. Friendly staff, fresh food, creative menu.   I wish they had more bench seating (easier for Moms with little kiddos), and the place needs more sound-dampening panels (its loud in there), but I still love this place."}
{"text":"Great little spot for brunch & lunch! Quick attentive service - great patio to bring a pooch!! They even give a little water dish for them.   I had the Cali Benny. Love that they ask how I like my eggs poached. Great potatoes. Huge amount! Delicious seasoning on them too.   Overall a great place for weekday lunch or brunch. Weekends usually mean a wait!!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast at Toast the day after Thanksgiving. The entire staff were on their A game.  We were seated immediately, had coffee within moments. Food is what you'd expect, just plain good American breakfast."}
{"text":"UNBELIEVABLE! Never have we ever had food come out of the kitchen so fast, and they were packed, less than 10 minutes for food. Service was exceptional not only did we have one server but 2 and 3 servers. This is a well oiled machine! Definitely will be back! The food was excellent no disapointments here!  we had sausage and cheese omlette and ham Benedict substituted with sausage. The hash browns were awesome and the food stayed hot until the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Its ok. I have been a few times and enoyed it but not the best I ahve ever had. I really dont know what the hype is about.  I have only been there for breakfast and had better on the food tour when we stopped there."}
{"text":"A little hidden gem. We have pasted this place several times and visited it on the food tour. What a pancake, raspberry and I am not a pancake fan, it was great. Nice atmosphere and even nicer owners. We had a nice time and look forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"Interesting concept - every server is your server.  It was nice because you get constant attention.  I had the breakfast sandwich - excellent.  Also tried a single pancake, also very good.  Place was clean and outstanding service."}
{"text":"I won't be back....  I was really looking forward to Toast opening in Dilworth as I have had good experiences at their former Huntersville location.  Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed.   My toast experience started out with a long wait for a table which is just fine.  I figured the place must be good with so many people waiting to eat there. I was wrong.   Our first impression started with the coffee which was Horrible. And I do mean HORRIBLE.  It was so nasty that it was undrinkable. My Dunkin Donuts coffee induced urine likely has a more pleasant flavor and aroma. The manager said that the coffee comes out good 75% of the time.  WTF?  How the hell is that possible? The corn bread was extremely dry and had a flavor that I can only describe as \"fecal\".  Wash that down with the coffee and it's like someone took a dump in your mouth.   The service was very poor.  It was some of the poorest that I have come across in a long time. After 40 minutes our food was finally delivered.  If you are going make me wait that long at least give me the option of ordering a bloody mary or a mimosa to numb the pain. I ordered the breakfast burrito.  It was cold and utterly tasteless.  My hash browns were mediocre at best. And the \"homemade\" salsa was anything but.  It tasted like the cheapest mass produced salsa available that they then added some red onion to. Evidently according to Toast throwing some onions in there makes it \"homemade\".    To sum it up, there was a long wait, horrible service, and terrible food. Perhaps Toast doesn't have all of the kinks worked out yet.  However, there are plenty of other places for brunch nearby in Dilworth that are consistently good. Fortunately I was using a Groupon.  But even at half price it wasn't worth it. I will not be giving Toast another try."}
{"text":"Toast is one of those cafes you never want to leave. Their breakfast foods are outstanding.  I most recently went out for lunch with some co-workers and got the left-coast BLT served as a wrap instead of a sandwich and substituted the pasta salad for a fruit bowl. All of the ingredients were fresh, our service was great, and we enjoyed a quick, yummy lunch!  Definitely a restaurant must if you are in the Davidson area!"}
{"text":"Place is pretty average. You would think with the name that they would emphasize \"toast\", but no. I got the Country Benedict and it was ok. My son got the Blueberry pancakes and said that the blueberries don't taste like anything and I can agree.   Again, this isn't a bad place. Just pretty average. Service was good, setting was good. Pretty busy place too. One issue, cashing out is a pain. You have to go to the front where you feed in to the same line of people as coming in to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the Toastery and so does my pup. The staff is So nice and bring my pup water :) Food is so yummy too! Great brunch spot!!!"}
{"text":"I went here during the week so there was no wait. The best part about this place is that any server can wait on you, as they pool their tips. On the flip side, the service wasn't that great and we had to call over a waiter about two times. I'll give them a pass though because they all probably thought someone else had checked on us.  The food was tasty; it's difficult to mess up breakfast food. There is a shared parking lot. No major complaints about this place. I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast food. The pancakes were some of the best Ive had. The omelettes are really good. The way the service works is that all the waiters have everyone so you're checked up on a lot. The only knock against it is it's VERY expensive, which, for breakfast food, is a turnoff."}
{"text":"Ordered their special meatloaf. The food was definitely microwaved. The mashed potato was disgusting frozen pile of crap. The roasted veges, were sauteed and so chewy. The table was dirty and sticky. Every server is your server is the weirdest serving style I have ever seen. You will pay $10-$11 for a tasteless meal.  That being said, the one star is for the water, it was filtered and actually tasted good."}
{"text":"Hooray for a new breakfast spot in Charlotte--keep em coming!!  Their breakfast menu ranges from traditional items like egg sandwiches, omelets, french toast, pancakes, etc.  I highly recommend any of those items because they are excellent.  Their hash browns are fresh cut potatoes with a very tasty seasoning.  They are wonderful!  But, what I would really check out would have to be their \"specials.\"  They had crab benedict, stuffed french toast, unique omelet blends, etc.  My husband tried the nutella and strawberry stuffed french toast.  Of course I \"encouraged\" him to order this because I had my eye on the pumpkin spice pancakes but desperately wanted to try that french toast!  Let me just say, we made the right choices!  The stuffed french toast was absolutely heavenly.  It tasted like a chocolate covered strawberry.  It is hard to explain but the bread balanced the \"sweet\" so it was a perfect combination of flavors.  You could always order a side of hash browns if you need something salty to complete the meal!    My pumpkin pancakes were the perfect fall treat!  They were super fluffy and the pumpkin flavor was very prominent!  I don't know about you but I have had pumpkin pancakes that didn't taste like pumpkin at all...it just tasted like cinnamon or nutmeg or allspice.  These were light and flavorful.  There were three of them, which was the perfect amount.  They weren't huge so I didn't feel lethargic, bloated and tired after this breakfast.  They mix things up so the menu is always changing.  I am thrilled that  they opened a location in Dilworth but taking a ride up to Davidson is a nice change of scenery as well!  Either way, check them out!  You will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast food. A little pricey but the food is definitely fresh and very tasty! The service is great, fast and attentive. Family friendly."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with a previous encounter at a different Famous Toastery, but hubby suggested we try this one on my birthday morning.   It was a Monday so it wasn't crowded. The venue is quaint with an old-fashioned almost rustic decor.   Our waitress, Meiyah, was attentive and nice. I opted for the \"combo\" which included two fairly decent-sized flapjacks, one egg and two sausage patties.   Food arrived quickly and was hot. Everything tasted great.   Glad I gave it a second try."}
{"text":"I have gone here a couple of times. It's good dependable. Nice choices for omelettes like goat cheese. A little disappointed the spinach in the omelette was frozen. Overall a decent value."}
{"text":"This Famous Toastery is in a great location. It is within walking distance to Davidson College and cute, local shops.    When we got there, we were told that there was a 20 minute wait. 40 minutes later, we were seated. Our witty and exuberant waiter brought fresh cornbread with homemade apple butter to the table. The cornbread was cold. It would have been better warm, but, it was still good. The homemade apple butter was not the smooth, creamy, \"butter\" like thickness that is the traditional apple butter. This apple butter had small chunks of apples with hints of cinnamon and other spices. I really enjoyed it!   The three of us ordered various items from the menu. One of us ordered french toast, scrambled eggs, and two sausage patties. My other dining companion ordered the Runner omelette which consists of egg whites, turkey, roasted vegetables, and brie. It was served with a buttermilk biscuit and breakfast potatoes. My table mates were pleased with their meals. I had the Cornbeef Hash with two eggs over easy and hollandaise sauce. It was made from from real corn beef. Not that canned stuff! I really enjoyed the hash! I would get out without the hollandaise sauce next time.   Our coffee cup and water glasses were never empty and if we needed anything, we would ask the closest waiter our waitress. As soon as we were seated, the waiter told us that every waiter and waitress were there to provide service. I like that system!   Overall, the food and service was good. I would come back again."}
{"text":"I wish I had taken the time to take a picture of what I ordered but the food was so freaking good, I couldn't help myself to indulge.   Upon coming in with my friend, we were acquainted by a pleasant surprise. No line! Maybe because it was because it was a Tuesday as well.   The whole shmazz of the thing is that you seat yourselves, it's a team-server setting where everyone is your server if you need one. You have the choice of a breakfast or lunch and if I could, I would've ordered breakfast AND lunch.   I ended up getting the French toast with a side of turkey bacon and breakfast potatoes. It was so bomb and the service was bomb and I was just so content with my meal and experience that I will be going out my way to find another Famous Toastery at my next PCS and fingers crossed it'll be the same experience."}
{"text":"Famous Toastery, previously Toast, is a casual and good breakfast spot.  The menu consists of typical breakfast items, with daily specials offering unique items.  The menu sometimes can seem overwhelming I always struggle with what to get. So, needless to say I have tried a variety of items, eggs, omelets, crepes and pancakes, along with several side items. The eggs are always great, how can you go wrong, right? As for the omelets, every one I have ordered has been wrong, and isn't anything special. The mushrooms seemed canned, and the peppers and onions are always overcooked, never with a fresh crisp taste that you should have.  The pancakes were great, light and fluffy. The most disappointing items I have received consistently are the potatoes, or home fries and the english muffins. The potatoes are not worth it. Always underdone, dry and just wrong.  Please learn how to make home fries, and learn how to keep them warm.  As for the English muffin, please learn how to \"Toast\" one.  I have yet to receive one that is pretty much right out of the English muffin box.  Overall, I still am not sure what the hype about this place is.  Expect a long wait time, shotty and random service and decent food."}
{"text":"I love this place! There are unique items on the menu. I had an avacado stuffed with a poached egg with cheese and a spicy tomato mixture. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!  They have a different service process :all of the wait staff waits on you. You are well taken care of.  The staff is very friendly,  food is very good and the atmosphere is very bright and cheerful."}
{"text":"We ordered to go, it was nice and quick.  Good grits, egg sandwich and breakfast burrito all hit the spot.  Glad to see gluten free waffles and French toast, planning on returning to try them.  Friendly staff, busy restaurant."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast on a Sunday when they were very busy and were seated almost immediately and our food came fast. We have never had a bad experience at any of the Toast locations that we have been too. I just wish they would bring the northwestern omelet back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and oh my word will we be back! The service is great and the food was even better! Not to mention, we literally got our meals about 10 minutes after we ordered. It was great. So glad we gave it a try. The manager checked on us often and the servers were always on top of anything we needed. What a great spot for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"I guess we made it here at the right time! We were taken in by a waiter with a nice smile and greeting. We were told any one with a black shirt ( waiter or waitress ) was there to serve, just ask. So I'm liking this place, right from the start. I'm new to these breakfast brunch places, they close so early but it's a new day. My wife and I both Chosed The bagel, lox and creamed cheese plate. It brought back memories of when . . . . The meal was very enjoyable, just a bit pricey. Their hours are 7am -3pm so I figure they are going to make up for closing before the 5:00pm crowd.  We will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"A terrible experience today. It started when a 45 minute wait turned into an hour and 15 minutes, the last 15 of which we could clearly see our table unoccupied but uncleaned and would have been longer if not for us prompting the cleanup several times and eventually literally seating ourselves knowing that we were top of the waiting list. It took all our patience not to walk out several times- unfortunately we had invested so much time already we kept thinking \"surely it can't be much longer now\"  Then we had to ask to order, ask for water, ask for cornbread despite other tables next to us being seated later and already served. We had to remind them 3 times about our juice orders as well.   At the end a different waiter apologised, and explained the computers had crashed.Why didn't they just explain at the start?  We could have gone home instead and come back a different day. Unfortunately now, our experience was so bad we will never brave toast again."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic breakfast. Service was quick yet we had cornbread and apple butter while waiting! They offer coffee at the entry. Love this place. Our server Deanna was attentive!! Thanks everyone!"}
{"text":"We tried this spot after a recommendation from a friend. Let's just say we came back twice during our stay in uptown Charlotte. It's so neat how this restaurant is designed. They are housed inside of an office building and depending on where you enter in, you see a totally different side to the unique buildout. The customer service was phenomenal. We were seated in a timely manner and because of their setup, all of their team members serve your table. Our drinks stayed filled and our orders were right on time. They bring out the sweetest cornbread while you wait for your meal. Huge setup! You get full off of the cornbread because it's so yummy. Our meals were awesome. The gravy biscuits and eggs Benedict were amazing. To end our brunch, we met the owner who was so nice and wanted to ensure that we had a memorable experience. All the reasons why we returned a second day. This is definitely a staple to try for breakfast or brunch if you're in uptown Charlotte. It's within walking distance from all of the great hotels making it even more convenient. By the way...you can't beat their prices! Did I mention the Mimosas????"}
{"text":"I really like the food here & frequent it regularly.  The employees are always all very nice.  The manager was very attentive to a small issue I had last time I was there.  Not a complaint but just a bit of inconsistency with some items.  I'm hoping that it's fixed next time.  She was appreciative that I informed her & sent me home with a proper item."}
{"text":"If you love brunch you'll love Toast. It was a great place to spend our Sunday morning and there's a shady patio out back to sit with your dog. I am passionate about eggs Benedict and the Cali Benny was awesome! Four stars because my eggs were overdone and the service was slow. Also, a little pricey for what it's worth but you're paying for the atmosphere too. Overall a great place to eat."}
{"text":"I've tried to keep my mind open to this place because my girlfriend loves it but idk man. The wait is always crazy. It's very loud inside. The wait staff is very nice. But for what the food is, which is just the dish you order on a plate with no sides unless you order them separately, it's overpriced. The food is also very bland and almost always needs extra seasoning or condiments. Whenever I eat here the only impression I get is \"I am eating food.\" The orange juice is really good but also overpriced - I think it's 5 dollars for a \"large.\" Am I just ordering wrong? With so many better places to eat breakfast in Charlotte at the same or better prices, Toast is pretty much the only one I say \"eh idk\" to."}
{"text":"How have I managed to miss out on Toast for so long? I had bookmarked it after its ROTD for the longest time, but I've just not managed to make it over here at breakfast time. (Which is not to suggest that Toast is *only* breakfast!)  At 10:00 in the morning, I was wanting something delicious. And since I can't go to the Flying Biscuit at the moment (don't ask - it's cool), I let my Yelp app bring me here instead. Not much of a crowd - three other tables had some folks at them. Some mommies at two, a business meeting at another. And me, a table of one.  What to have? What to have? Eggs, of course. And toast, of course. What arrived a short while later was a mushroom and cheese omelet with two half slices of sour dough toast. The omelet was perfectly cooked and the toast was perfectly toasted, but to be honest, I was a little sad that a restaurant with the name of Toast only gave me a single slice that was cut in half. Sad face.  Service was friendly and good. Plenty of good coffee. The wifi worked great and I sat there for a good 45 minutes until my battery ran down.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This counts as a 4.5 star review for me.  I've heard about Toast and their tasty breakfast goods for a while now.  I was up in Davidson earlier this year, but they were closed.  I've been hearing about their imminent arrival in Charlotte and was happy to hear that they had opened this week.  I stopped by for brunch this morning and was greeted at the door by two members of staff.  The dining area was probably 30% full at just around 10:00am and I was told to seat myself wherever I chose.  The dining room was open with the bar on the left when you enter.  My server came to take my drink order as well as to drop off a basket of cornbread.  She was very knowledgeable of the menu and was even able to tell me what items I was considering used locally-sourced ingredients.  I decided on the stuffed french toast with peanut butter and bananas with turkey sausage and an egg.  Not more than ten minutes later, my food was out.  The french toast was over-the-top!  So good.  Fans of the PB&B combo will love this dish.  There were a total of four slices (four triangles) and I ended up having to take one home.  The sausage and egg were decent - nothing to complain about there.  The service I experienced was terrific.  I ended up being assisted by maybe three different members of their wait staff.  I have no problem with that, but it gives you pause when you're leaving your tip.  But that wouldn't deter me from going back.  Definitely worth a visit.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch because I have heard a lot about this place and I honestly don't know what the hype is all about.  When I arrived the place was pretty packed, and the hostess let me know she was going to look around for a table. She came back and we were seated. A server came and greeted us and asked had we been there before and we both said no. He then explained on the menu that it states that everyone is your server meaning that many of them will check to see if your doing okay and need anything, sounds good. He went and got our drinkers then took our orders answering any question we had. We both decided to get the Combo with French toast, eggs and bacon but substituted potatoes for the eggs instead after we asked if we could do that. Then that was pretty much it as far as service go with that waiter. He was nice and knowledgeable though which was great. One other server did come up to us to see if we were okay but other than that no one else really came by the table which I felt since \"everyone\" was your server there would be a little more interaction especially once our waters started to get low. Now on to the food. The potatoes were amazing and if I were to come back it would be only for them. And the bacon was good too. The French toast on the other hand was bland and they mind as well have used sandwich bread, I didn't finish it.  Overall the server was good but other than the potatoes the food didn't really impress me."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Horrible service. The restaurant was not busy but we saw our waiter once when he took our order. Our food arrived via a server and no one returned to our table to see if we needed anything. We had to find someone to get our bill. A huge disraction was a man standing by the men's room. Toastery employees were going over to him 1 by 1. Very odd. Even the 12 year old in our group commented on the situation. The man eventually left. We don't need to go back, once was quite enough."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. We will continue to go to the family owned breakfast spot up the road from our home (costs a tad less but the food is way better!). I had an omelette, I felt that for what you pay it should be loaded with the items added on and it wasn't. Corn bread was meh."}
{"text":"This was my first time to this location, and it was so so. I hear a lot of good things about this chain, but I must not have ordered the right thing. I had the northwestern omelet with grits and wheat toast. It was bad but just more expensive than j think it should be. With tip this and coffee cost almost $18. Too much  The staff is incredibly friendly. I'm sure there are other things on the menu, but in not itching to go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in Davidson as a half way point on a long road trip between DC and GA and went to toast based on Yelp reviews. It is what they say it is - a neat, trendy, comfortable spot for breakfast with excellent food. Great little place, full of locals and college kids (and college parents as I caught it on an extremely busy morning during what turned out to be parents weekend). The interior is comfortable and quite large, although it looks small at first - there is outdoor seating out front and back as well. The food was very good, although the menu was not exceptional - the setting helped make it exceptional, though. i guess my point is they appear to do breakfast standards, but didn't seem to have many special or unique dishes to make the place exceptional. Nice, big cup of coffee. And a friendly, although busy, wait staff. As far as I can tell, it is the breakfast spot of choice in Davidson and for very good reason. Davidson was a neat little area to stop and I recommend it to other travelers passing through and looking for a comfortable, quaint little spot for a bite to eat and to escape the stress of the road."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place so I couldn't wait to try it out. We got there around 10:30 or 11 on a Saturday and the line is out the door waiting for a table. Good sign. Walk in to see a few open tables and the girl said wait was 20 mins for 2. Not bad. About 30 mins later they sit us at one of the open and cleared tables from when we walked in. Hmmm. I order a omelet and my wife ordered oatmeal and a side of breakfast potatoes. Staff comes out to say they don't have apples for her oatmeal and she was fine with that. Then my meal and her potatoes come. Oatmeal is way behind. My omelet was Delicious. Potatoes were just ok. She didn't really touch the oatmeal. It wasn't very good. This place seems very overrated at first glance."}
{"text":"This was our first stop after a red-eye from the West Coast, not a bad way to start the day. Solid coffee, not too strong nor weak, and they kept us topped off. We tried the waffles and flapjacks (pancakes), both hit the spot. Recommended for breakfast when near Dilworth."}
{"text":"Now I'm not usually a \"go out for breakfast\" person. Not that I don't love breakfast foods, but it's just that it's rare that a place does something that turns out better than if I was to make it at home. After hearing good things from family about Toast, the miss' and I decided to see what all the hubub was about. We had a great meal, and it was definitely better than anything I could have made from the comfort of my own kitchen!  Toast is located in a quaint area of Davidson that also happens to be near the Farmer's Market. I highly recommend parking at Town Hall since there is only street parking near Toast (plus you'll also be mere feet away from said Farmer's Market.) We got there at a little after 9am on Saturday morning and the place was HOPPING! There were three groups waiting to be seated ahead of us, and by the time we were next to be sat there was an opening at the bar, which we took. Don't get me wrong...there are plenty of tables in Toast. There were just a lot of people also looking to get their breakfast on.  Once we sat down one of the servers came over and took our orders. Within two minutes another server had brought over a basket of corn bread and fresh apple butter-spread-stuff. The corn bread was ok, but the apple spread was DELICIOUS!  I ordered the Country Benedict ($9.95) which consisted of two eggs (however you want), ham and a biscuit, all smothered in sausage gravy. I went with scrambled egg, which ended up being a nice thick layer, giving it more taste and texture. The ham was not some cheesy thin deli slice but a thick, hearty slab. And it was GRILLED! It was sooo good! Then there is the biscuit. It was buttery, flakey and wonderful...everything you could ask for in a Southern biscuit. All the above ingredients were covered in a pool of this sausage gravy that was crazy good. In the end everything came together to make one heck of a TASTETACULAR meal.  The miss' went with a lighter fare and got Cali Benny($9.95) which consisted of poached eggs, avacado and tomato smothered in hollandaise sauce. It normally came with English muffin but she upgraded to a biscuit (.30) and added some spinach to it as well (we were not charged for that.) I didn't even think of trying it because I'm not a fan of avacado, tomato or spinach. She really enjoyed it, and it was so much for her that in the end she abandoned the egg and other things and focused solely on the biscuit.  Both our breakfasts came with home fries. Home fries are always hit and miss because, in my experience, home fries generally mean something different at each restaurant. At Toast home fries consist of chunks of potato tossed in spices. I was not a fan of them...the spice didn't really add any flavor and the potatoes were too soft. I ended up dipping mine in the sausage gravy to give them an extra boost of flavor.  All in all, Toast is a very good way to start your day. You may have to wait a bit to get seated, but once you have a table the service speed really picks up. While I was disappointed with the side of home fries, the rest of the meal was very good and I would definitely go back next time we have a hankering for going out for breakfast."}
{"text":"Little pricey but food is excellent . Service great . Can't wait to go back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"After going to the Ballantyne location (and being completely unimpressed), I walked into Toast of Dilworth a while back with a friend for some Sunday brunch action. (Yes, brunch, my favorite meal, word and idea.)  The food was fine, and I think I ended up with a mimosa-like drink (but maybe they were out of OJ?). I appreciate the wealth of vegetarian and GF options for those who need them.   Service was good, and the place was packed when we walked in, well after noon. It's a very popular restaurant for the Mahs Pahk and Dilworth folks. So after waiting for about half an hour, we were finally seated.  So why only 3 stars? It's just not that memorable. But it will do in a pinch!"}
{"text":"Had a three egg Omelet, with onions, smoked sausage and cheddar cheese. Lots of onions, very little sausage and hardly any cheese. Very disappointing! The grits were like soup, also disappointing. A $10.00 breakfast and you only get one slice of toast??? I don't believe the Omelet was made with fresh eggs. The coffee was good!"}
{"text":"The best fresh squeezed orange juice. Really fast service and tasty food. Always a wait do you know it's good."}
{"text":"Love the strawberries and cream cheese stuffed French toast! Shrimp and grits are amazing too"}
{"text":"Great food and good people!  I think a little pricey, but overall worth the trip.  Need more parking and seating on Sundays.  Wish they were open later.  Closes at 3.  But, all in all, I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Meh...  Not good. Not bad. Just MEH.  So excited to have a non-chain option near concord mills, but Toast has been disappointing for a while now and this location (only a name change) follows suit.  Their food is ok, but overpriced and not anything extraordinary.  Good to have nearby but just as a matter of convenience, not for mind blowing breakfast."}
{"text":"It's noisy, it's packed, but that is because I think all Davidson flocks here on Saturday mornings! It's delicious, the quality of food and coffee is great. The servers are so sweet!"}
{"text":"Breakfast with the ladies at this lovely spot! Looking out over the water, sun shining through the window and Alex the server is so efficient. The server did forget to bring our cornbread and apple butter out. We order omelets and pancakes and fruit....simply delicious!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot in Huntersville. I'm so glad we have one here and don't have to park up in Davidson all the time!  I like how everyone is your server. All the workers are consistently friendly, and we have personally had good service every time we've come.  Yes, this place is more pricy than iHop, but it is definitely worth it! You may have to wait a bit for a seat on the weekend, but again... worth it!  We've tried a lot of the items on the menu: breakfast bowl, pancakes, eggs Benedict, corned beef hash, etc. Everything that we have had, we've enjoyed!  The #1 standout is their fresh squeeze orange juice. I've never had it until our most recent visit, and I can't wait to come back for it!"}
{"text":"This really is a 1.5 - but since we're close to the holiday's, giving it a two.   Wow what a total let down!!! I've been waiting for months to head out to Davidson and try their breakfast, but we didn't get out there until after 5PM - so dinner it was. We were the first people there when they opened and I was impressed with how quaint and inviting the small \"bistro\" like restaurant was. Our waitress's (two of them tagged teamed us-not sure why, we WERE the only people in there) were polite with us and offered up the evening specials, which sounded de-lish. I ordered a glass of chardonnay -- it was ok--but not memorable. They brought out freshly baked bread, still warm from being removed from the oven and an incredibly rich butter that had been turned with what I think was orange -- I loved it, but my guest did not, but her palate still has room to grow, trust me.   I ordered the Fresca salad to start (mesclun mix, hass avocado, apples, walnuts, cranberries, bleu cheese crumbles, raspberry vinaigrette), easy on the cheese and dressing on the side--thank god for that. I've never in my life seen a CREAMY/THICK vinaigrette - when I think of vinaigrette, I think of an oily base. I ask Morgan, one of the waitresses about this and here explanation was that it was whipped... whipped into a disgusting mess... it was more like a mayonnaise. I asked for a balsamic -- that too was lacking, but I was happy to eat my salad sans dressing as it was a great combo.   At this point, the restaurant was packed! And everyone looked so happy to be there and with their food - ha!  I was so excited when they brought out our entrees - I ordered the Atlantic Salmon (parmesan risotto, sauteed spinach, tarragon beurre blanc) and substituted asparagus instead of the spinach.   The presentation was beautiful and tarragon beurre blanc smelled incredible! But a hot mess... the salmon was hot (it was really good too), the risotto luke warm and the asparagus cold. I immediately stopped the waitress and told her my issues... So minutes later they returned my plate -- I could but help breaking out in laughter!!! A crazy kind of laughter --- the waitress saw this and asked what was wrong. First off, they just cut off the end of the salmon where I tasted it and made is 3/4 of the original size and just warmed up all my original food! Are you freaking kidding me!!!   So the manager  came out (which this woman clearly needs to take a pill) and ACTUALLY told me they just put my salmon on the griddle to keep it warm as they warmed the rest.... I laughed again -- are you kidding me?   I grabbed the other waitress and said I couldn't do it and to please take it away... my once perfect salmon was dried out crap on my plate, the re-warmed risotto was now bad oatmeal and my asparagus was charred. The manager came over to grab my plate and said they would re-fire a dish, I told her NO thank you that it shouldn't take three times to make a meal (and god know's what the chef was going to do to my food - I saw the movie \"waiting')  I would say I would go back, but not with that manager.. what a bitch. I just wanted a wonderful meal from a place I've been waiting for months to go to, but because of her grumpy ass, you can forget about it. Will I recommend this location, absolutely not... I was not in the wrong and she made me feel like I was.   So Toast Davidson, you can toast my ass goodbye!"}
{"text":"Should be a 2.5, would have received a solid three as the food wasn't all that bad... it was just cold and service sucked.  Okay, okay, okay so I am a glutton for punishment. After last nights experience at the Toast in Davidson, why on gods earth would I go to the one in Dilworth for breakfast... Well the parental units wanted to take me out for a belated birthday breakfast.   Okay, the wait wasn't bad, the decor clean, the seats too small to be comfy... the staff ran around like chickens without their heads on. We had at least three-four different servers.   Dad ordered the crepe special.. nothing special there and luke warm. The sausage patty he said was really yummy. I ordered the Avocado omelet (avo, bacon, tomato, Parmesan cheese), but with egg whites only and with rye bread and topped with their salsa. I really would have loved the omelet, but it came out luke warm on the outside and cold on the inside because of the avo's... And not to mention topping off the omelet with cold salsa... really? Oh and my toast... cold.   The coffee was horrible! I mean crap! I mean shitty... it was horrible crappy shit. We all sent our coffee's back and opted for ice tea (and we were not the only ones).   The pancake was really good, their syrup is good, the potatoes were good (mom didn't like them as she prefers hash browns)  My food would have been really good had it been served hot. But then what put it over the top was the service... too many hands in the pot.. we had to ask for our check.. they said it was on the table.. NOT they never gave it to us.... whatever.   Will we come back... not anytime soon... they still have a long way to go to get their act together... luke warm food is NOT acceptable and mismanaged customer service is a no-no... I prefer my tag teaming done in the wrestling ring thank you."}
{"text":"Usually pretty busy so you may have to wait for a seat. Their egg and meat sandwich is huge! My husband gets this every time with over medium eggs and it comes with 2 eggs on it! He can't ever eat all of it. I've tried tons of different breakfast plates and have been satisfied every time. It's a little pricey, but almost always worth it!"}
{"text":"Let me start with what I absolutely loved: 1) the space- beautifully redesigned with a separate party room! 2) location- overlooking the lake at university place is perfect! 3) food- delicious!  Now to the 2 things I took off stars for:  1) \"Everyone is your server\" was horrible. It seemed like nobody communicates with each other because we had a server check in with us almost continuously the entire time. I have worked in restaurants before so I see NO advantages to this concept for the customer or the server. The idea that you can \"ask any one of us for something\" is actually standard practice in most restaurants . You won't find a server who isn't assigned to your table refuse to help you- it's what servers do for each other.  2) Servers made us feel incredibly uncomfortable. It was slow so it was very noticeable when there were servers just pacing the floor, gathered nearby gossiping, staring at tables. I'm sure there was somewhere else they could have been. We counted 6 servers to handle 3 tables. Six! Did all 6 need to be on the floor? No. 4 or 5 could have been in the back doing side-work or just not there at all.  Overall- I won't be back for awhile. There are plenty of amazing places to eat in my own neighborhood."}
{"text":"The wait staff was very friendly. The food was very good and the coffee was hot. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place appeared to be mobbed when we went, but we sat instantly.  The environment (at least for Brunch) is pretty hectic.  We had good service, but we literally had a different server every time someone came to our table.  In terms of food, the bacon was REALLY good, and ironically, the toast sucked...  Anyway, I would come back here for brunch to get some more bacon and eggs for sure.  I would just try and avoid peak times."}
{"text":"This place is super cute and the coffee is amazing!! Very homey feeling, nice staff, and the menu selection is wonderful! The pancakes are ginormous - you can even order them as a side : ) They have indoor & outdoor seating, bags (corn hole) to play while you wait for a table - you can seat yourself as well as you pay upfront at the end. This is a great greasy-spoon type of place for the mornings.  Best tip about this place: They give you cornbread to munch on while you wait for your order."}
{"text":"I was disappointed a few weeks ago when my friend and I had dinner here. I had not been in a long while and had always liked it. It was a Friday night, rainy and unusually quiet for weekend night. I ordered the fish tacos. which were generally tasteless. The fish itself was ok but it was covered with raw cabbage that had absolutely no taste. It had not been given even a slight splash of vinegar.and salt I saw a couple of tomatoes pieces and a little bit of spicy sauce which must have been on the bottom.. It was on a small  thin round shell and after a couple of bites, it fell apart. It happened with the other two as well. There was some kind of sliced mango and peppers in a small cup on the plate. My friend had the Balsamic Chicken, presented very poorly. .  It was on a plate that was way too small with  bed of mashed potatoes which were half cold , like a quick Microwave heat up and only parted got warm... The chicken was breaded and very red from the Balsamic vinegar. It was surrounded by tons of gravy and a side of spinach. She had to ask for a plate to drain off some of the gravy because the plate was way too small for all that food and too much gravy. It was not that great It is too bad as since it was a slow night, there could not have been a rush in the kitchen. I will not be running back too soon."}
{"text":"Service is fast. Biscuits and gravy are perfect. Pancakes are light and fluffy, Southwestern omelette has great flavor. Fresh squeezed orange juice with pulp and great coffee! Our go to place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This was a great little find before heading to Anderson for the college tour.  The specials sounded so tasty - it was hard to choose.  My son was thrilled that he could order lunch at 9 in the morning.  The hot chocolate was outstanding.  The portions were quite plentiful for the price.  I'd say my only complaint is the layout of the seating.  I felt like the servers were constantly walking by our table but other than that, they were friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"On my first visit to this wonderful little restaurant, everything lived up to its reputation. Just on the fact that they served unlimited pure maple syrup with the breakfast pretty much says it all. How many restaurants serve pure maple as the default option for your pancakes..french toast, etc? Place seems to be eternally packed but there is quick turnover, great ambiance, attentive staff...so the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"So happy Toast found it's way to Fort Mill! We stopped by on a Thursday around 11a expecting minimal people but the place was packed! As usual, great food and better service, or organized chaos as I like to call it.  I normally get breakfast but today I ordered the Lobster Rolls. That's rollS with an S. I was not disappointed.  Huge chunks of lobster, shredded lettuce and a whisper of mayo on a delish buttered roll. On the side was a cucumber salad with diill and a light dressing.  Simple and fresh. The food showed up very quickly and the waitstaff were attentive but not hovering. We met the owners previously at their Ballantyne location and she was there today greeting customers.  I know they will do well in this location and I wish them nothing but success. I will be back. Often."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday at 1. No wait which was good. 3 different people tried to take our order. That was confusing on who our waitress was. I ordered the Avacado omelet no tomatoes. Well it came with tomatoes. Usually I would deal with it but I was pay $12 for eggs and it better be right!! Not really impressed when it came out again. The small chopped up pieces of bacon were really hard and burnt. Not worth $12. Breakfast for 2 adults was $31!! And almost $5 for OJ. Yeah save your money go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Famous toastery is one of my few favorite spots for breakfast here in Charlotte. For breakfast when out and about i will normally grab a mimosa. Here they have something  called rumosa, which is a mango rum,fresh squeezed orange juice, and their house champange. It is sooooooo good! I been wanting to try their creamsicle one which i may try on my next visit i had the shrimp and grits it has a cajun taste once u mix everything together this place is perfect for breakfast you have to visit atleast once make sure you try the rumosa umm umm good!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, once for breakfast and once for lunch. To be honest, I don't really understand the hype... it's just okay food with kinda quirky servers.   My most recent visit, I got a #5 burger topped with chili, cheese, and slaw. They have a lunch special of meatloaf and mashed potatoes, so I asked if I could substitute the chips that normally come with a burger for the mashed potatoes. They said they would see if that was an option. If not, I told them, I'll be fine with pasta salad. I'm not sure what they consider MASHED potatoes... but I ended up with hash-brown-like grated potatoes mixed with butter/cream like you would do with mashed.   They forgot to bring the slaw for my burger, which was fine. The burger itself was quite thick, at least 3/4\", but slightly over-cooked. I can't say it was the worst burger I've ever had, but certainly not close to one the best you can find in Charlotte.   My lunch companions, however, seemed to really enjoy their meals. The one who requested we come here for her birthday had a pancake, eggs, and bacon. She said they have \"the best bacon\", so maybe I should've tried something that included that...   Overall, unless someone REALLY wanted to come here (and it was their birthday), I would not choose to come back."}
{"text":"The food is ok at best. It lacks flavor, big time! While the \"everyone is your server!\" idea is nice in theory, it generally just translates into \"no one is responsible for your table so you constantly need to flag someone down.\""}
{"text":"I stopped by the Famous Toastery this morning. I've got to say it was the best breakfast I've had in a while. Give it a try sometime......."}
{"text":"Sat down at an empty bar and waited for service.  Waited.  Waited some more.  4 very pretty girls come in and sit down at the bar.  Someone runs over right away to take their orders.  I know I'm no super model, but I'm a human being.  Very disappointed to have been marginalized in such an obvious way.  I walked out feeling very self-conscious that I wasn't good enough to be served by Toast."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. It's right on the lake so you could get a nice view of the fountain and lake.  They serve breakfast all day and the food is well prepared with a huge selection. My granddaughter had the Avocado Benny which is her favorite dish there.  We had burritos, avocado ,  Waffle and egg dishes.  All were delicious.  The server was helpful and accommodating to our needs."}
{"text":"I've had two very disappointing visits here. This one however resulted in me probably not returning. A note for the owner; you need to discuss with your hostesses the importance of why you don't tell your customers there's a 30 minute wait and then let someone else walk up and just sit down outside without waiting, right in front of those same customers, and tell them they can do that. I told one of the two hostesses what had happened and how unhappy I was about it. She did apologize and I let her know we would no longer be dining with them."}
{"text":"Love the food, the ambiance, the servers, but the pricing is just double what it should be in some cases. The price point isn't justified."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and brunch! Quick and friendly service, and the food is always fresh and fantastic. My boyfriend and I also enjoy the more health conscious menu, we eat here every other week, and I'm stuck on the Avocado omlet, never had better! My only improvement would be I wish they were open longer!"}
{"text":"I was visiting family in the Charlotte area and we went to lunch while doing some Giftmas shopping at the local store for Wildcats fans. The food was good, fresh, and plentiful, and the waitstaff were super patient with us-- we had a toddler in tow who was in need of some food, stat! Overall, I liked the homey atmosphere and the simple but perfect salad I had gotten. I'll definitely have to visit next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"We've been here 2 times now. The food has always been amazing. Great family, laid back atmosphere, and the service has always been fast. Average wait time has been about 15min but plenty of shops to walk to while waiting. Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"One the best breakfasts I've had in a long time.  Great service, lots of hot coffee and an amazing variety on the menu.  Everyone is the party made special requests and we all got exactly what we wanted - at the same time- hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Charlotte lacks solid breakfast places. Coming from the lovely land of diners, I love a good breakfast. Yes, I want eggs, toast, grits, potatoes all with a side of pancakes and bacon. Don't judge me. Saturday morning, this place is busy, but we got seated quickly. They brought warm cornbread to the table and kept the coffee flowing. We ordered the crab cake benedict  and it was good. This place has the staples you would expect at a breakfast place and some options with a little twist. This place has a lot of seating and large parking lot, great for a large party."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good location, and I truly was taken aback, yet appreciative of the 50% discount for military!  It's located on the man-made lake next to the Hilton complex. A place where all the servers wait on you."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous. Waited 20 minutes to order, 40 minutes into waiting for our food the waiter had an attitude when we asked about the wait. After 50 minutes we left. The staff is rude and argumentative. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Toast for a while now and finally did this weekend!  Let me preface that I am a breakfast nazi.... I'm just enamored by the idea of mixing sweet and savory and the first meal of the day (can't beat that).  The idea of breakfast for dinner is definitely great for me... but I digress.  It definitely took a while to peruse the menu since everything sounded really delicious including there specials for the day.  I ended up ordering The Runner! Omelet that was a mouth-watering omelet made from egg whites, turkey, roasted veggies, and brie.  TOTALLY awesome.  My friend tried THE Avocado Omelet and said it was excellent as well.  I did manage to sneak in a side order of French Toast...as my treat for sweating out a 1.5hr hot yoga class (in the yoga studio located in the same shopping center).  Probably undid all the hard work, but I definitely enjoyed the sweet after a great omelet.  The omelets are served with one side hash browns, grits or fruit and toast.  I totally went hash browns (more carbs!)  Do you see why I love breakfast now?  Definitely have to come back here to try their other menu offerings... and maybe dinner.  I think they are open for limited nights...  Our server was very friendly.  My friends that live in the area said that they have been trying to eat here for a couple weeks, but couldn't stand the wait since it's been so crowded.  It worked out really nicely for a Saturday morning and we never felt rushed or anything.  I think a lot of other people got the tail end of the new opening grown pains... but our experience was great."}
{"text":"There are so many restaurants in my 'hood that I have yet to try.  Toast was one of them.  Actually, I've lived within walking distance of this and have never stepped food in this little shopping center.  Wow, looks like a lot of local gems in here.    Anyway, I'm here to experience Toast.  It was toward the end of the operating day so I was told I could sit anywhere.  I chose a place close to the window.  The decor of the place is simple with a few large pictures on the wall.  There is a wall of windows on 2 sides which makes it bright in there.  They left the door open so there were plenty of flies in the place which was a bit annoying.  So this is my first visit.  The menu has 2 sides with lunch fair on one and breakfast on the other. I had to ask if I could order from both being that I was in the mood for breakfast at 2pm.   So yes, you can order a late breakfast.  They get a point for that.  I decided to go all out here with a Boursin cheese omelette, hash browns, and a flapjack on the side.   The omelette was amazing.  It was a decent size but it was surprisingly light.  The cheese was savory.   The hash browns were more like home fries with big chunks of potato but still quite tasty.  And the flapjack was big and topped with powedered sugar.  Suprisingly, this was quite light as well but still very tasty.  Prices here are very reasonable.  For all I had, my meal came to a total of $12 and change, without tip."}
{"text":"Been three times each because someone else had invited to celebrate on occasion. I will NEVER go again. Very disappointed that this operates as a chain and the kitchen is not scratch made. Can't deviate from the menu and order things you may like. Their sausage is like McDonald's patty sausage so I tried  to order a smoked sausage sand which. They told me they had smoke sausage and it wouldn't be an issue they brought me a sandwich with the the chopped smoked sausage that they use in the shrimp and grits (ordered on two separate occasions and both times it was brought to the table cold). This place gets rave reviews but for me with three tries I can't waste any more time..."}
{"text":"We went for Father's day Brunch and we were quickly seated so that was nice. We sat down at our table and because they set the tables with menus, we had to wait and ask for a child's menu. If they set the table with menus and you have a child in your party, the hostess should accommodate your needs and supply you with a child's menu. I shouldn't have to ask for it.   So our server asked if we had ever been to a Toastery before and we had not, so she explained that all servers work together and everyone is your server. I thought to myself, \"Oh Cool.\" But that thought changed throughout our meal. There are servers everywhere but no one looks at you directly so getting someone's attention is a cluster  you know what. My man had to eventually get up and ask someone for help because we couldn't get anyone to our table. He did this a couple of times. So please do away with this. I do not get this concept. Or if you are going to stick with this concept, train the servers to smile and do eye contact so that if someone needs help they can get it.  We were going to order off their Brunch Menu Specials for Father's day but they were out of a couple of items. So my question is why have the special menu out? Everything else was on their regular menu. In fact, the eggs benedict I ordered was on the special menu but the server rang me up for what was on their regular menu and it was slightly different but I didn't want to send my food back.  Overall the food was okay. Nothing special. My hollandaise sauce was on point and the potatoes were seasonded fairly well. They don't have a fryer here so they don't offer fries with a hamburger on the child's menu. So we opted for fruit which was mostly cantaloupe. Not very child friendly if you ask me."}
{"text":"Toast has great food don't get me wrong. My issue is how they seat people. They seat you by how many people are in your party. This is annoying because i frequently have a group of three, but they will seat multiple groups of four before us even if they come in after."}
{"text":"We regularly come here on the weekends (it's walkable from our home).  The food and service is good.  Food is traditional breakfast food.  Weekends get busy with a normal wait (especially for tables with more than two people) of 15-45 minutes."}
{"text":"The food is good but just sooooo expensive for what it is. Breakfast shouldn't cost $40 for 2 people to have a simple breakfast. The prices are what prevent me from coming back more often."}
{"text":"Tofu omelette was amazing! Quick service from the bar. Forgot alcohol sales didn't begin until 12 PM on Sundays..."}
{"text":"The latest (I think) addition to the Famous Toastery family arrived in Huntersville in early January and from what I can tell has been packing crowds in, especially for weekend breakfast since they opened.    The chain started as Toast and had to change the name in order to expand into South Carolina.  Their calling card, as much as anything, is the mantra of every server being your server and that definitely played out on our visit as we had any number of staff members taking orders, bringing food, refilling drinks, etc.  It's a relatively high tech operation in that orders are taken on tablets vs. written on order pads or simply memorized by the server.  They've got other nice operational touches like two colors of coffee cups.  One for decaf and one for high-test so there's never a question as to what you're drinking, only if you'd like it warmed up.  They're open 7 days a week, 7 AM to 3 PM and both the breakfast and lunch menu items are available the entire day.  I've only had breakfast thus far and have enjoyed what I've ordered with the most recent try being the corned beef hash with poached eggs.  It was old school, hash (think from a can) so nothing fancy but it was tasty with perfectly poached eggs on top.  i   Price-wise, I can see where other reviewers are coming from... It may be a little steep but, not too off-putting IMO.  The one downer for me is that it is LOUD when the place is full.  It's hard floors and high ceilings so not much to absorb sound.  On top of that, it seemed like they played the music loud to make sure you could hear it on top of all the customer talking and that just made things worse.  I also agree that parking is very limited.  It helps that you can use the Credit Union spaces next door on Sundays but, things could be better.  None of that is enough to stop me from coming back however and i look forward to sampling some lunch items in the near future."}
{"text":"Loved the food but the service was absolutely terrible. Their motto was all the servers are your server but it seemed like no one was our server. It was seat yourself and so we sat somewhat in the middle. We waited 20 minutes to get just a menu and a drink. Then after we ordered we waited 45 minutes for the food and everyone that walked in after us was getting their food. In addition, our only refill was 5 minutes before we left, after we had finished our food. Very disappointed with the service, but the food was very good. I ordered the avocado omelet and a sweet tea."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and the food is always exceptional. Today, we went for breakfast and my egg white omelet with tomatoes, bacon and Boursin cheese was beautifully fluffy & so tasty!    We typically eat inside and enjoy 5 star food and service. Unfortunately, today we opted to eat out on their back patio. The flies are responsible for the 4 star review. So gross!  I was constantly waving my hand over my meal and the flies were dive-bombing me from every angle. A couple even managed to land on my waving hand!  I understand that it's outdoor dining but there's got to be something that could be done to lessen the flies. I'll be back to done again at Toast but next time, I'm staying inside!"}
{"text":"Went in there and it was a nice ambiance. Very clean. Staff very friendly and attentive. Great brunch spot. Sweet tea is well done. Corn bread is served  every time you go.  I tried the french toast which was very delicious."}
