{"text":"Reading all the reviews I had high expectations. Being that I eat gyros all over town, I was excited to try these guys out. First off its a nice little spot, with a mom and pop shop feel. The old man at the front wasn't welcoming - I had a couple questions about the meal I was ordering and he acted as if I was stupid and was supposed to know. When I finally got my gyro I was fairly disappointed to say the least - I had tamato ends and no real slices and very little onion with no taziki on the sandwich- it came in a little cup, i had more gyro meat than their street taco sized pita could handle. Sloppily thrown together and thrown into a bag. Rude old man at the front and I paid 4$ more than I would for just the sandwich at my regular spot (flaming kabob). Needless to say I won't be going back to this place. Hope you have a better experience than I"}
{"text":"Best shawerma in the city bar none. Excellent french fries, too. One of their Greek salads with 
pita bread and shawerma is the best lunch for miles around."}
{"text":"I try and eat here regularly. Hummus is great. Very personable staff. And the atmosphere is awesome. Look forward to the next time!"}
{"text":"I ordered a salad with gyro meat around lunch time to-go.  There were a few diners when I stopped to pick up my meal.  Gyro meat was good. Tatziki and pita were good but the rest of the salad was blah.  The dressing they serve with it (oil/vinegar) had little flavor and the salad was 90% iceberg lettuce with one olive and some other veggies.  I'll go back, get a gyro and try the hummus next time.  Overall a good place."}
{"text":"Ordered gyro pita take out for dinner ...
Was very disappointed ... the gyro was very dried ... and the pita was kind of hard ...
And there were like 2 pieces of tomatoes and couple onion here and there and that's all .... wrapped in aluminum foil put into a brown bag ... 
one sad looking gyro and one sad feeling tummy....."}
{"text":"The gyros meat is delicious but the pita at times throws everything off by not being super fresh. 

What I will say rocks at this place is the gyros salad. I've never seen one with such a generous portion of gyro meat. Delicious dressing too."}
{"text":"went for dinner on sunday in april 2012. been going there since 1981. new owners a couple of times. this visit was not like the others. took so long to get our order. gave less food than before. ran out of the rice. food wasent up to par. think that was our last time eating there. very pricey. lots of greek fast food better than here, and much cheaper."}
{"text":"After seeing they have been open for 25 years my family and I were really looking forward to enjoying a great gyro sandwich....unfortunately we would have to look elsewhere. All 4 of our sandwiches came on a stale pita that was soaked in grease...Yuck. Typically, fat equals flavor but when it came to the gyro meat we found it to be mealy, full of gristle, and lacking any sort of flavor at all. On a positive note the owner seemed very nice but he needs to freshen up the restaurant and buy a higher quality meat if he hopes to make it another 25 years!"}
{"text":"Authentic greek food. Reasonably priced. 
Came in to town from ABQ and stayed on Scottsdale road
we walked to the unassuming little resturant, it looked like
a tucked away little hole in the wall that is frequented by
the locals, as the place was packed. Ordered a Gyro dinner
plate and sandwich, with ice tea. Ever since I have moved to
the southwest I have struggled to find a \"New York\" or \"Chicago\"
Gyro  (Yee-Ro), until now. Papa and beanio were cutting the meat
off as fast as they could take orders. 
Highly recommend putting the \" Mexican\" food, with beans and rice aside
for a spell and going Greek!"}
{"text":"The Greek salad is a must try. Gyro meat is fantastic. For me, the best part of the meal was the tzatziki sauce - phenomenal. A hidden gem in the Scottsdale/Shea area. 

Give it a go. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wow! Surprise!  Guess What?  The Greek salad you though was so good for you.  Think again.  It's NOT made with Olive Oil anymore.  I suspected as such and asked the waiter and he admitted it!  He said of lately they use Soy (OMG!) or Vegetable Oil!  Again, OMG!  I told him I knew it was not Olive Oil and since when can they say it's Greek?  A true Greek or Italian would never use anything but Olive Oil.  Terrible!  Just terrible!  The pita that came with the Greek (yeah, right) salad was dry, yesterday's Pita my friends.  And way less meat than they used to put on it.  I have been coming here for years.  It's been a while since I have been here.  I wondered if maybe they did not sell.  Unfortunately, until they go back to really being Greek, I'm done with this place.  And sorry to say, I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"************The dinner plates are .......  a Good Value**************

          The Dinner Plates come with a Nice Size Greek Salad with Feta Cheese.
          Plus a side of Rice or French Fries and Pita Bread. 
     We've eaten here three times ...... the first time was disappointing.
The last two times .......... HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING.
The portions are very generous .....and the seasoning RIGHT ON.

                             My Wife enjoyed her Kabob ......
                     My Gyros ...... the best I've had in Arizona"}
{"text":"Had lunch here last week...same as always!  Great food (gyro and a Greek salad) that is fresh and flavorful. Best gyro in town in my opinion."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for 14 years. I can't say enough about the fact I have never had an incorrect order or a bad meal. This place always does good for me and my co-workers.

I also feel dumb after reading some of these other reviews and realizing that there is more to order then the lamb and beef shawarma! I am truly amazed the fries are always the same and I love their style of fries. YUM. I can tell you I have tried some of the other sides they have , including , but not limited to the fried mushrooms and enjoyed them! I am going to try the chicken shawarma this week after all the good things I read.

I have been sending customers here for over a decade after I realized how good it is. I have asked some of them to tell me if they don't like it after they try it. I can say I have only heard good comments.

This is a great change of pace to the normal stuff a lot of us eat. Give this family business a shot. You maybe eating there 14 years later like me.

Thank you Gyros Express for all the tasty and consistent lunches I have enjoyed!"}
{"text":"I will make this short and to the point.... 

I came here completely because of Yelp reviews. I was sold by the 3rd or 4th 5 stars stating the food was really good for \"express.\"  

But I have to disagree :( 

I got the falafel lunch special and exchanged a salad for the fries. Not because I am trying to be super healthy, but because I love those types of salads! 

But the flavor was off, there were ends from the thick part of the lettuce that no one likes to eat, and the olives still had the pits... 

Ouch... 

Then came my falafel pita. The pita was not warm. The falafel was sooo salty it was hard to eat and they looked like they had been deep fried for a long time. I just kept dousing everything in the white sauce to eat it.   

I didn't have a long time to spend there so I just said everything was \"okay.\" But I won't be back :(  

So, I realize this wasn't very short, but once I get going it's hard to stop! :)"}
{"text":"First time eating here, came because my parents recommended the place. I ordered the Gyro meal and it was fantastic !!! My meal was $13. Small venue, and it feels like you're eating right at home."}
{"text":"Been coming here for many many years. Family owned. Saw the kids grow up in the restaurant and now run it. Everything is exceptional at great prices. The BEST gyros in town along with the best pitas. One of my favorites is the lamb shank dinner...check it out!  Come on in and support a local and long established restaurant with authentic Chicago Greek flair. You will not be disappointed. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great food! I loved their hummus and you must absolutely try their gyros classic! I'm a bit of a picky eater too when it comes to different meats but it was very good. The great pricing didn't hurt either  :)"}
{"text":"Delicious greek cuisine. Gyro is excellent. Baba ganoush, a generous portion and pita bread was hot and perfect. Cucumber yogurt paste is phenomenal. French fries are fresh cut potato fries! Rarely do you see fresh cut fries. Try an Ã¥ris greek beer with your meal. Amazingly light smooth and delicious euro lager. Family owned, cozy and deliciously authentic. I will be a regular here. The Saturday local lunch crowd knows!!!"}
{"text":"Not to be confused with the imitators, this is the original- and the best! Food is amazing and authentic Mediterranean, service is great, to say pricing is reasonable would be an understatement and ambiance is cozy. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"In a somewhat disjointed location lies a tiny gem of a restaurant. And any time I see \"express\" in a name I am usually hesitant to partake. But on a whim I gave Gyros Express a shot:

It's hard to argue that a proper gyro is one of every single person's favorite sandwich. And they can range from blissful to horrible... Right? Well, here you have them executed to near perfection, at least for my taste. I am a sucker for too much tsatsiki, and overly tender lamb. And solely for those reasons I whole heartedly recommend this establishment! 

The inside feels and looks like the \"dining room\" in a doublewide trailer, and the plateware and utensils match...but who cares, the food is cheap and delicious. Skip the million places that have \"pita\" in their name and seek out my favorite place for gyros! 

Oh, and the hummus! Go!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Completely empty at lunch time. That should have been a bad sign but I always try out the small businesses in the area. Limp, unseasoned gyro and fries. I had to put the fries in my over so they would be decent. Tossed them with salt and seasoning to make it them appetizing. The only saving grace was the Sauce. Other that I will never go back."}
{"text":"Great Family run restaurant.  The Gyro meat is superb. BBQ ribs are outstanding, the meat falls off the ribs.  You can't go wrong with the Grecian Salad with either grilled chicken or Gyro meat. Finally, french fries are the best in town."}
{"text":"went for lunch a month ago. been going here for many years. had a bad lunch. the soup was too thick and salty. the breading on the saganiki was falling off and it was not bubbling in the juice like usual. the chicken kabob was tough. it was overcooked. sent it back. my daughter had the pita sandwich. it was good. also the pita bread is different. seems like they bought it from outside.  maybe they were training a new cook. i saw a cook i never seen before. ill take a break for awhile. too inconsistent."}
{"text":"The food here sure IS good...if you can get any! This appears to be a father and son operation and the father frequently isn't even there. There are never more than two people working here to serve a restaurant that attracts at least 20 people at a time and as a result the service is VERY slow and spotty. I respect the food, but they've got to add staff because the frustratingly poor service undermines the whole dining experience."}
{"text":"Total hole in the wall mom and pop shop with an almost cheesy/rinky dink decor but that's totally OK when the food is made fresh, served piping hot and tastes pretty darn good. We tried the gyro pita and added french fries (take note that any sides have to be added as the entrees are served solo). Although the prices are a little higher than we would have liked, the food itself was fantastic. It's a great hidden spot to stop by whenever you're in the area. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great place good food and excellent service. I. Have been coming here for years and it's always good. This is original and cut from the lamb skewer not microwaved. I recommend this please try it."}
{"text":"I was actually excited to move back to the area. I wanted lamb grape leaves bad. Went there ordered them, they show up with veggie ones. I said I wanted meat/lamb. The server said no people like these more. Well I do not. Later found out they don't make them anymore. Even though on dinner menu. Ordered something else, wasn't good. What a bummer."}
{"text":"Good, authentic Greek food. Ordered a Greek salad one time and gyro with fries the other. All were great. The gyro meat was so fresh and tender. 
The decor is a little outdated and the outside doesn't show it off but they were very friendly and it wasn't a big deal overall. The food makes it all worth it."}
{"text":"Some friends of mine took me to the gyro express in Scottsdale..  The sign on the wall should have have been a client as the sign said that this restaurant is not affiliated with any other gyro expresses as this one is family owned..

I order the beef and lamb schwarma and it came out really gamey and honestly tasted  like burnt briquettes.  I mentioned to the waiter that I wasn't realy fond of my briquettes and the waiter told me that it was never case as 99.5% of people love their schwarma.  Interesting thing is that the three other people at the table tried it and they all thought it was just as awful as I did.  So not sure how the waiter came up with his percentage as 100% of the people i was witb thought that it was flat out awful.. sorry I didn't take a picture but I should have to do the review justice.."}
{"text":"Been here several times. The prices are very reasonable. Not a big menu, but it's all Greek and it's all good. Gyros come on fresh pita bread with cold cucumber sauce and are the best west of Chicago. Spanokopita is excellent with the right amount of cheese to spinach. The mille feuille pastry is done right. The grilled chicken was moist.

My only quibble is that on each of our visits, the waitress kept disappearing on us. Sometimes, our food would be brought by the busboy; sometimes, by the cook."}
{"text":"Don;t really expect this place to be around much longer. It has really gone down hill. Been coming here for almost 20 years when visiting and it gets dirtier and dirtier and the lettuce seems to get wiltier and wiltier. Can you spare some decent cold crisp lettuce that is not sheer white in color? Rude service as one of the reviewers here mentioned. Good tzatziki should be made of yogurt, grated cucumber, garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil. Theirs is made of sour cream and some spices. Left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the Chicken Shwarma Sandwich  is \"THE BEST\" Sandwich in the City.  That's all I have to say.  It truly is the best.  The chicken is all white meat,  very juicy.  Cooked and seasoned to perfection, and there is a TON of meat in this baby.  The bread is chewy and hot and grilled just right.  It comes wrapped in foil.  My favorite part is when I open up the foil and the heat and steam hit my face and fog up my glasses... and fill my nostrils with the great smell.  The french fries are hand cut and some of the best around.  All the food is great, but the Chicken Shwarma sandwich is outrageous."}
{"text":"I used to like this place but enough is enough and never again. This is now the third time my chicken kebab was raw in the middle... Seriously if you are in a kitchen and can't cook chicken you really shouldn't be in a kitchen...

I'm leaving the restaurant feeling hungry, ripped off and concerned I may develop some food born illness. So good-bye Gyros Express its not you it's me - I don't like uncooked chicken."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a whim when we were taking care of errands in this area. My husband & I are huge fans of Greek & Mediterranean style food. The restaurant was quaint but a little run-down looking. Service was simple & quick. We both thought some of the meals were a bit overpriced but maybe we're just used to the many other competitive fast casual places. The salad wasn't anything outstanding. The french fries were good, but again nothing special. The best part was easily the meat, which tasted fresh & wasn't overcooked, & the tzatziki sauce was some of the best we've ever had! The meal was satisfying but not something I'll make a point to go back for."}
{"text":"Ever have a craving for a great gyro? If so I highly recommend a trip to Gyros Express.  This great little hole in the wall restaurant is quiet, clean and unassuming.  What it lacks in decor it more than makes up for with the quality and taste of its food.  

It is refreshing to find a neighborhood spot that serves authentic food and doesn't cut corners.  The portions are healthy and not padded with tons of onions.  The meat  is well seasoned and the tzatziki sauce on the gyros is thick and creamy - not that watered down stuff that others serve.  A gyro and fries will run you about $8 and you won't leave hungry.

I have tried several gyro spots across the valley but I continue to return to this one. Lunch or dinner, the food will be worth the trip."}
{"text":"I enjoy unique family owned hole in the wall small shops.  This has really good food and friendly staff.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I was hoping for a great experience from the reviews but unfortunately that did not happen. My food was accidentally taking to the wrong table and that table began eating my french fries. When the staff figured out it was the wrong table they just picked them up off of the table and sat it down in front of me. They saw that they had there hands in my fries but did not care. When I asked for new fries, they gave me attitude. Sorry but I prefer my food not touched by other guests."}
{"text":"By far best Gyro Sammy in the Scottsdale area.  My family has eaten here for 15 years.  Excellent fries, family run.  It is disappointing the family didn't trademark their name as it appears another gyro restaurant has opened with same name.  
The gyro is by far the best in town"}
{"text":"I drop by this place once a month and it's always very good! I love that's it's been around forever. It has a very old school feel. The french frys and onion rings are so good!!"}
{"text":"Good food at reasonable prices.  Decor could use an upgrade but the food made stopping here definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Prior to this visit, I had not been to Gyros Express for approximately eight years. I remembered the food being good quality and flavorful. For this visit, I met two friends for lunch. 

Food - Poor. The quality was lacking. It did not seem like a good quality product and lacked the complexity of good greek food. I ordered the Gyro and was very disappointed. The cost was FAR too high for the product received, which did not compare to others I have had. We also split an order of hummus which I thought lacked seasoning and had an off putting texture. 

Service - Poor. We were the only patrons in the restaurant for most of our visit, but could not get the attention of the waiter. He did not refill our drinks, and was very slow to take our order and bring our food. 

Ambiance - The restaurant is very basic and somewhat rundown inside. Certainly not what you would expect in central Scottsdale. 

My friends and I do not anticipate going back to this restaurant any time soon."}
{"text":"Sorry, one of the most IMPORTANT parts of eating is health and cleanliness. I ordered my food and the owner took my money. I was waiting to see if he was going to go and wash his hands after handling the disgusting money. He walked away and Im thinking great job hes going to wash his hands, but he went to refrigerator for toppings of Gyro. This is how people get sick. Thank goodness Im not a health inspector.
Very disappointed. If you have this type of violation, who knows what else is going on."}
{"text":"I stopped by Gyros Express the other day for lunch and I'll definitely be back. I ordered the original gyros with fries and it was amazing. They really don't skimp on the beef and lamb. I'm suddenly hungry just thinking about it. The girl working the register was super friendly and personable, too."}
{"text":"I had the Gyro Special with extra meat and then substituted the fries for a small greek salad.  They have this yummy herbed cheese on the greek salad with a tangy vinaigrette that melts in your mouth.  Seriously the most juicy gyro meat and they put the sauce on the side so you can figure out how much you want to have.  The service is awesome and the price is great for all the food you get.  The parking is sometimes a little funky out front, you might have to walk across the street but it's not too bad."}
{"text":"Had a craving for dolmades, stopped in at 1:30 pm. Service was fast and friendly. The cost at $9.80 was pretty high for a side, but I thought if 6 of them done in authentic Greek then it may be worth it, sadly they were not. The dolmades were tossed on lettuce and loosely rolled. The filling was still warm. No lemons or oil on tops. The yogurt sauce was not enough for 6 large. I miss the former Aladin's off of ViaLinda and 90th. I guess that I'll be sticking to Vitamin cottage/natural foods for their non-gmo versions, 3 for under $3 without the yogurt dressing."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for quirky decor, great food, and you don't want to spend a fortune, this place is it.  Service and food are always wonderful!  A friendly, family owned and operated business. I usually have the lunch salads but the gyros is great and the burger and fries is darn good as well. Today I ordered the chicken kabobs and it was fantastic!  I would give 5 stars but for two small things:  I'm a bit of a wine snob and their selection is quite limited--not terrible, but limited; and 25 years of popularity is showing in the furnishings; it's worn a bit thin up front."}
{"text":"This place is a long time staple in Scottsdale, it's been there for almost 30 years, so first off I want to say props for keeping up the game for so long, I respect that! However there is a major problem with their service and personal interaction, frankly it's awful.

The food is pretty decent, it's what you'd expect from a sit down take out mediterranean spot, you shouldn't expect a 5 star gourmet meal and you won't get a 5 star gourmet meal, but you'll get a decent bite. The gyro meat is hot off the spit and hey let's face it, gyro meat is so tasty it would make a dirty sweater taste good, so it's kind of hard to screw up gyro meat. Their other meats are good too, their Kefta is good, but a bit on the crumbly ground beef side which it should not be. The falafel here is terrible, it was soft and mealy and had no crunch, plus it was served with store brand Tartar sauce...really didn't add to the flavor and just did not work, some of the worst falafel I've had. Their house tzatziki sauce however is good, it's the kind of thing you put on everything and never get sick of.

The main problem is their unbelievably bad, slow, impersonal, unfriendly service. I've been to places where service was slow for good reasons, i.e. it was busy, it was opening night, etc. But this place was slow and sloppy with NO ONE in the restaurant. Our first server was young, probably a teenager, he wrote down a drink order and just vanished, never saw him again, he was replaced 10 minutes later by one of the older owners/managers, who was the most unfriendly guy on earth. He took out a note pad, said okay, didn't make eye contact once, and asked us what we wanted to drink, a second time. No thank yous, no \"coming right up\", just okay and walk away. One of our group even said that they were previous guests and that they really enjoyed it, and his response was \"oh okay yah.\" We got our drinks and food with zero interaction, he just threw them down and walked away. Our drinks ran out, nobody came by once to refill or check on anything and we could clearly see them sitting around in the back doing nothing. Having to flag down someone for a refill in a restaurant with 3 other people in it is sloppy and lazy. This guy took the bill, brought it back, and said okay next time thank you.

  I've worked in restaurants, I know how things should go, this was unacceptable and sloppy, it was a diss to customers who come in and give you their money. Being ignored and not even looked at while ordering and having zero interaction the whole time is just crap. I won't support that and I won't return, once again, it was not the food, it was the service.

 I don't care if you're running a 5 star palace in hollywood or a mom and pop strip mall store in any town USA, do the right thing and treat people right, give them decent customer service, make them feel appreciated for walking in, and don't be lazy."}
{"text":"We've been eating here at least once a month for years. Family run business, very friendly. The Dad gets a little grumpy at times, so do I. The Gyros sandwich and Falafel sandwich are good. The french fries are the best we've found in the area. Like the BBQ Ribs and Chicken. The sauce is not real spicy, but good. They have lunch specials that come with fries and a drink."}
{"text":"This is the place I use to compare others gyros too.  Shish kabobs are wonderful also.   Good home cooking.

Update:  Finally had the lamb chops.  They were wonderful.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good lunch specials Mon-Fri from 11-3pm. About $8.50 or so and it includes your drink and fries (w/ sandwich) or rice (w/ kabobs). Grecian chicken is great. Kefta kabobs and the chicken kabobs are great. The amount of gyro meat in the sandwiches is about double what I get at other places. One of my top lunch spots.
Try it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My rating only pertains to their Gyros as I have never tried anything else here. I have been coming here since 1991 and I have probably had a 100 of their Gyros, sometimes with fries. Average size Gyro but it's their sauce that makes them so good. I have given up ordering Gyros from other Mediterranean places as I am always let down."}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised on all the very positive reviews for Gyro's Express. I would give it about a 2.5 based on the quality of food, portion size, & cost. I ordered the greek salad with falafal ($10) and my boyfriend ordered a gyro lunch special ($10). The falafal balls were simply not good. They were dry & dense and lacked the crispy on the outside/soft on the inside freshness of good falafal balls. The salad itself was really small - I expect a larger portion size for a $10 salad. I will say the feta on top of the salad was quite good but there were only 3 small slices. My boyfriend thought his gyro was average and that the greek place down the street (taste of greek) made a better one. The french fries were good, but that is not so hard to do. All the seating is indoors which really is a shame in a place with good weather. Overall, I wouldn't come back here to eat again because there are lots of other choices nearby."}
{"text":"We ordered the lamb gyros. The service was excellent, very friendly staff and our food was made quickly,  however I can't lie we were not impressed with their food. The lamb was dry and they don't put lettuce in with the gyros sandwiches like most Greek restaurants.  The overall quality of the food was not good and I hope they can improve on this as I'd like to come back again some day."}
{"text":"Best gyros in phx by far. never disappoints. especially good when it's busy."}
{"text":"Recommended by GE's neighbor Comb-a-cabana. Stopped in for a carry out lunch order. A gyro overflowing with meat complimented by fresh tomatoes and onions. The fries still had skin on which was a nice surprise. The meat has just the right juiciness and seasoning. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch one day while doing business in north Scottsdale.

While the location and outside appearance do not impress, the friendly service and atmosphere was a pleasant surprise.  it appears to be owner (or family) run.  They were quite nice and courteous.  

I ordered a greek salad with Gyros.  It was a nice portion size with a nice pita on the side.  The gyros was good and not under cooked as can happen in places trying to serve it faster.  

1 star for the nice atmosphere
1 star for the good food.
1 start for quality service

Up date the joint a bit and another star might be in order."}
{"text":"Discovered this place by accident. Didn't want to go far from our motel, didn't want anything too fancy, and didn't want fast food. This became the perfect choice. 

While they don't claim to be an authentic Greek Restaurant, they do claim to be an authentic Chicago Restaurant. I've never been to Chicago, but I have friends from there, and they would love it here. 

Good, friendly atmosphere, great Gyro meat, the best Kalmata olives and really good Beef and Lamb Shawarma. And the best, second to none, pita bread, anywhere."}
{"text":"By far the best I've had in the valley! The food is always fresh, great portions of meat, and the staff members are always extremely friendly! 
Pretty much the only place I go anymore!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a couple years now and over the last year the service has really gone downhill.  The food is still good, if unremarkable, but the service has gone from good to acceptable to substandard.  The servers always seem to be in a rush, probably because there is only ever one person for the entire place.  This may be my last visit."}
{"text":"Holy moly yummy gyro!!!! We each did the lunch special, a gyro, fresh French fries and a soda for $9, can't beat that! Quantity is not a problem, the gyro was overflowing and the french fries were nice and hot right out the fryer! Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Wow, AMAZING food. I got the Gyro meal and it was hands down the best Gyro I've had. The meat was tender, not greasy at all, and super fresh. Highly recommend! Also, great customer service and cleanliness of restaurant. Next time I won't be ordering to go!"}
{"text":"Oh my!!! Best lemon and rice soup. The Greek dressing on the salad has such a unique flavor. And those are just the starters!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken shwarma is awesome!   The fries are hand cut and really good. Service is quick and the prices are reasonable. May have found my new lunch spot!"}
{"text":"You call it in and still have to wait for your food when you arrive. ready in 15 ins means 15 mins not another 10 or 15mins. I work close to here and will never go in again."}
{"text":"This is the best Greek food place I have been to. I always get the lamb and beef shawerma. I think this is the best item on there lunch menu. This item is not always available at Greek food places."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Got the gyro special. The tomatoes were soggy and the pita bread was a little dry. The fries were clumped together and tasted like they had been cooked in old oil. Don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch got the gyros sandwich and it was grate, the fry it came with was ok kind of soggy, not that bad tho. The customer service was good, they were very friendly. Most likely coming back"}
{"text":"Great Gyro. I needed a fix and they came through with the lamb and the garlic and t sauce . Not too much tomato and onion. Hit the spot perfectly. Get an extra napkin and dig in"}
{"text":"Best Gyros in Arizona, hands down.  Their taziki sauce is the best I've had anywhere!  Been looking all over but never find a better gyros than here."}
{"text":"I have been going to Gyros Express for almost 9 years now. My husband introduced me to it when we first started dating. He's been a loyal customer since he was in 7th grade. They have the best Gyros in the valley and their taziki sauce is so good. I order a side of taziki even if I'm getting their fabulous Mousaka dinner or a burger and slather it on everything. They have the 2nd best burgers in the valley. (Big Al's Greasy Eats is #1)  And I highly recommend the Saginaki. The atmosphere is certaintly not fancy, but the food is top notch!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in the mood for Greek food on our way home from visiting Sedona. Most of the Greek restaurants in the area are all closed on Sunday -- outside of this one! 

So we placed an order for takeout, since we had our dogs in the car with us from the hike in Sedona. We arrived and my boyfriend headed in the grab and pay for our meals.

I ordered the Gyro Dinner, which came with beef and lamb meat and, quite possibly the best fries in town.  I loved my meal! It came with a Greek salad and I thought the feta cheese was delicious. The tomatoes tasted great and overall, I was satisfied!

The French fries were also delicious and so was the gyro. The pita bread tasted dry and stale. My boyfriend's kebabs were also a little burnt, but outside of those minor details, the meal was great!"}
{"text":"The Gyro lunch is great and I though it was plain delicious. The atmophere is quite depressing and I prefer to order out  next time"}
{"text":"My name is Bo, and I'm a regular to the Gyros Express restaurant. Been coming here for over 15 years and have never had a bad experience. 

Gyros Express is not express. They have unbelievably fast service if you're picking up but I asure you if you come for lunch or dinner you'll be glad to know its a full sit down dining experience. 

The Owner's son is now the one running the restaurant and is doing a hell of a job. The guy is super nice to his guests and also cooks the amazing food. This guy is a master chef and an excellent server/restaurant manager. I seriously recommend coming here to be given the opportunity to meet this guy. 

I always get the classic gyros. I usually eat two per visit or take 3-4 home with me. They're very reasonably priced for what you get. A massive portion of lamb with veggies and their special sauce on a warm (not too hot but definitely not cold (perfectly warm)) pita bread. You just can't go wrong with it on a first time-100,000th visit. 

This place has my heart. Will be a forever customer!"}
{"text":"Love this spot! Gyros are always tasty and the fries are amazing! Try the schwarma, top notch! Prices are incredible - would recommend for meat and potato lovers!"}
{"text":"This family operated restaurant has been serving my family and I Gyros for decades. 
 This is hands down my go to Gyro spot. From here to Boston, no other Gyro comes close.
If you like Gyro and you haven't visited this little gem, you are in for a treat!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Greek food in Scottsdale.  Small family owned with great character, service, and food.   We are a Greek family from Chicago, love good Greek food,  and have been eating there for over 10 years."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall Greek restaurant with authentic Greek food. I was by myself shopping at the High Siciety nearby and they recommended this place for what I wanted: a non-chain where I could have a fast lunch by myself. The server was super sweet, the food came fast, it was affordable, it was delicious. What more could you want? Nothing!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was empty when we were there. Friday night 6 PM. Service was very friendly. Server suggested we eat the gyros since it was his favorite thing on the menu :-)
The gyros was ok. Filled with lots of meat. My husband loved the amount of meat, but it was too much for me. For my taste it could have had a little more salad in it. 
The fries were ok. 
The Saganaki cheese was good. 
I grew up in Europe but I haven't found a great gyros in Arizona yet that compares to a true gyros in Europe."}
{"text":"Very casual sit-down place but for the price of a snack bar! I dropped by here before strolling 3 stores down to Handlebar J for my weekly country dance sesh. Inexpensive and fresh food, and cold bottled beer! That's a sweet casual deal."}
{"text":"First, the good. Gyro sandwich was jam packed with meat.  Fries were very good, not at all mushy or greasy, obviously freshly made. Server was very nice and attentive.

Unfortunately, the rancid ketchup ruined the meal for me.they keep it in refillable squirt bottles and obviously something was wrong with this one.  Also, there were five empty tables, but four had dishes on them when I arrived and still had dishes on them when I left. Maybe they need extra help during lunch.  Decor is pretty dated and the whole place could use cleaning. Finally, the server had sweat pouring down her back and her shirt was drenched. I understand that some people sweat more then others, but there are ways to hide that, even if it means changing. Just not very appetizing.

I might stop by again for a sandwich to go, but would never sit down to eat here."}
{"text":"A quaint, no frills Greek dive with good food. Tucked away in a nondescript strip mall, I would never have found this place on my own if a friend of mine hadn't taken me one day. The lunch menu is diverse with plenty of choices, ranging from veggie to chicken to beef dishes. I've tried many of them and always felt satisfied. The hummus is tasty.

Also, this isn't a fast food joint. It's a casual and friendly sit-down restaurant with waiter service."}
{"text":"All of the great reviews had me so excited to try this place..... Wow we were disappointed. The taste of the food was OK at best. The salad had WAY to much oil poured over it and everything was just average at best. Probably the worst part way the cleanliness or lack there of! The whole place seemed greasy.... even the menus were dirty. We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Sweet service , Horrible food.  I got a combination platter with chicken and gyro.   The chicken Schwarma taste like old frozen Tyson precooked breast pieces.  The gyro had no seasoning or flavor.  The rice I was too scared to even taste,  based on the way it looked.  The server said everything was made Chicago style; but that's another way of saying we don't know how to make middle eastern food or American-style Lebanese cuisine .  On the flipside, The  restaurant ambience was a quaint little dark hideaway where   you can bring your sidechick or have a secret meeting if ya don't wanna be seen.  The place was very dark and empty."}
{"text":"I was seriously craving some chicken shwarma and hummus.  This place served excellent hummus.  My chicken shwarma was good, but maybe a little dry.  After I tried my fiance's lamb and beef shwarma I really liked it much more.  I think it was spicier than my chicken.  The service was great, and the restaurant was fairly comfortable with table seating.  No booths, unfortunately.  I think it could have stood to be a few degrees cooler in there, too.  I'd definitely go back for their hummus and lamb shwarma with rice.  I think it was a little pricy, however.  For lunch our bill for two entrees, hummus, and two drinks came to $36 before the tip."}
{"text":"I went here for what will be my first and last dinner at this location.  The lunch specials might be a decent value, but anything above an average rating for the dinner is overrated.

For instance, the Gyro platter included a salad and fries for $13 whereas the Gyro alone was $7.  Sure, the Gyro had a decent amount of meat and tasted fairly authentic (side note: I've had my fair share of Gyros in Greece).  However, a mediocre salad with two small Feta squares and some fries is hardly worth an additional 6 dollars.  Plus, the Gyro \"platter\" only had one pita with enough meat to fill three pitas.  Not to mention, the service and atmosphere was lacking for the price.  The waiter/ cook (/owner?) told me to let HIM know when I was ready to order (rather than wait on me).  Even when I did, he didn't seem to understand Greek."}
{"text":"Ok it's not much to look at. It's a storefront in Sundown Plaza with an outdated interior. But it has the best Gyro's in town. Also the Fries are fresh cut and delicious. Good Greek salad and Saganaki too.
It's family owned and they are nice people that have been in the same location for at least 20 years."}
{"text":"Holy Moley...I have been eating here for years. OK, walking into this place will not dazzle you. There is no ambiance, it is old, dated and plain. But it is clean and I don't know about you but I will take great food over ambiance any day. The Gyros are delicious. They give you so much meat and the pita is fresh, soft and delicious after they grill it with a bit of olive oil. The gyros salad is enough for two people and the oil and vinegar dressing is light and perfect for this salad. The Grecian chicken is the perfect blend of spices. On top of all that, the people who work there are so friendly, calling you by name when you pick up your order and always thanking you for coming in. 

If you haven't tried this little hole in the wall, you do not know what you are missing. 

I just made myself Hungary and now they are closed ...there is always tomorrow!!!"}
{"text":"Great food from a wonderful family owned business - very nice folk working hard.
I've been there a lot and the food is consistently good as is the service.
This isn't a fancy place (at all) so you won't be impressed by the decor; just go there for the food."}
{"text":"The lemon Greek soup was yellow but not good at all. The spanakopita was greasy and just ok. ( I buy frozen ones from TJ's and they are so good. A friend paid for lunch but even free doesn't make it better tasting. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've felt compelled to leave a review. The pita tasted like it was a week old, the meat was overly salty, with a pile of old onions. The fries were sort of ok. Something was missing. The atmosphere was depressing and I felt like I was annoying the guy with my existence. It was genuinely the worst gyro place I've ever been."}
{"text":"The Original Gyro Express! No other place is owned by this family. Great gyros and the gyro French fries lunch special is a great deal.  Definitely the place to go"}
{"text":"Love the owners here. They are great people, and have great food. Very hole in the wall place, but ALWAYS busy. It's great."}
{"text":"This is a true hole in the wall.  Off Scottsdale Rd.  I mainly get take away gyros.  They are top notch.  All their food is well prepared and tasty.  The dining space is nice.  Try the saganaki, flaming kassari cheese app if you dine in."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best option for gyros and greek/Mediterranean food in the Scottsdale area.  Lunch special  (gyro/fries/soda) for $10??? Stop it.  The gyro is so overstuffed it is ridiculous. 
Greek salad is awesome as well."}
{"text":"Their food is so authentic the most tasteful middle eastern restuarant I've been too! This place has been here for 30 years the owners are veryyyy nice. The staff were amazing. The gyros are over the top!!!"}
{"text":"I'd been looking for a solid, simple, casual Greek restaurant and finally found it in Gyros Express. The pita was really fresh and the baba was smoky and really good. The small Greek salad was generous but heavy on onions. Service was pretty quick and they have a large outdoor seating area that was nice."}
{"text":"I have been going here on and off for 20 years. I used to crave their gyros...sliced hot and fresh off the spit, piled high on perfect pita, and topped off with the best tzatziki sauce.
But lately...the gyro meat is never on the spit. You order and they pull a ziplock bag of parts and pieces of meat out of the fridge.
They heat these up on the griddle...and the end result is a dry gyro, with small pieces of meat cooked who knows when.
I don't know if the cooking changes are due to less business, or food safety concerns or what.
I just want my good old hot, freshly sliced gyro...anybody know where to get one in the valley???"}
{"text":"Food was great. Had a Gyro, fries, salad, and drink for $17... so a bit on the pricey side for a gyro. Happy to pay it from time to time due to the place being family owned and operated."}
{"text":"I have to say that I'm super picky when it comes to Greek food, and let me just say that this place is one of the BEST places I've ever had! I got the shish kabobs with a side of hummus and it was soooooo good that I might just have to go back there again today! They make it fresh once you order it which is nice but the down side is that I had to wait about 20 minutes for my food. But the waitress did tell me that upfront so I was aware. But well worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"A very hole in the wall type restaurant which serves food that is very close to its ethnic Origins. Although it is small and unheard-of by many it is a tradition for me and my father we have been coming to this establishment many many times. Their Gyros are delicious as well as their other Foods. I got the Falafel which was delicious and my dad got lamb shish kabobs which are also delicious. The Greek salad is always a great appetizer. I would recommend to anyone interested in this cuisine."}
{"text":"I love the food here. The gyro meat is very tasty. I have brought many new people with me to dine and all have been impressed. I do wish they would give you more tzatziki sauce. Also the service can be quite slow at times."}
{"text":"I was craving some Greek cuisine while
Traveling and stumbled upon this little place.  The location was hard to get to and when I walked in I was a little worried as I was the only customer.  I had the gyro which was good however the tikki sauce was a little thick and not super flavorful.  While eating several folks came in for take out.  The food overall was ok and met my needs however I'm not sure I'd return anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets for this style of food in this town. I've had the gyro, the falafal, and the broiled lamb chop dinner here and all have been extremely good. It's got a nice atmosphere and the owners are great people. I cant wait to try everything else on their menu. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"We love this family owned place. The staff is friendly and it feels relaxed and homey inside. The food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and a Greek friend of mine told me this place has the most authentic Gyros in town. The food is very good. And $9 for a decent lunch combo in Scottsdale is hard to beat! Not sure why, but today my tzatziki sauce was more like ranch dressing? Disappointed. The place is pretty run down... hope they don't start trying to save on the quality of their food."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. Their saganaki is amazing and bubbling hot. Their lemon soup is also top notch.  The servers are always super friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Gyros Express for over 12 years now - it's the BEST!  Their gyros meat is fantastic & I crave the lemon rice soup so badly that I've been known to send my hubby out to retrieve some at all hours of the day.  It's family owned & the service is wonderful.  We order take out from them at least once a month, if not more.  I highly recommend this place!  Bryn K. DeFusco"}
{"text":"We were in the area and got on Yelp to find a quick place to take-out on our way home. Glad we found this gem! The portions were generous. Their gyros have a generous amount of DELICIOUSLY seasoned meat and their special sauce was great. My hubby can't have gluten, so our server offered alternatives. He had a Gyro dinner and it didn't disappoint. Plenty of meat, AWESOME homemade fries and an average greek salad - fresh but nothing fancy or special. I had to have the baklava and it was delicious - warmed up in the toaster oven, as suggested by their female staff member - who was very helpful and friendly. Next time we will eat at the restaurant because I won't be able to wait the 20 minute drive home before biting into my next gyro! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Having lunch during the week with two seniors. My Gyros sandwich was fine along w a side salad. However someone ordered the beef skewer and the meat could not be tougher. The other person ordered Chicken Swarma it had an unexpected dry seasoning all over it.,why?  The seasoning was not at all necessary what a loser. No reason to return."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today, was a little disappointed in the price of the food and not real tasty. The Greek lemon rice soup was more of a lemon rice chowder, beware it is a bit salty but has huge lemon flavor. Also ordered the spinach cakes from the app menu.  I have had them numerous places before and they usually are delicious but not here, they did not have enough if any cheese in them and they were very greasy, which they should not be.  Also for $7.00 I expected much more than two small pieces.  The Lamb Kabob was just okay, the pita bread this time was not home made but store bought, bummer and the spices on the lamb did not really bring out the flavor.  The owner was okay, a smile or two and he warmed right up. Spending $25.00 for 2 apps and a kabob seemed very high considering the food was just so so if that much.  We will not be back"}
{"text":"Legit gyros, this place is a staple of Scottsdale. Makes me the good guy picking up takeout for the family. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Shawarma is to die for !! Family owned restaurant!! Not related to other gyro places in town."}
{"text":"Mmmm, totally agree. Delicious Gyros here. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Just checked it out today. The environment was sorta-kinda rinky-dink but still somewhat pleasant and charming. The gentleman who greeted me and took my order was quite nice and friendly, and even made me feel like a normal human being when I asked how \"gyros\" should be pronounced.

The food is certainly very good. I ordered the Gyros Dinner, first thing on the menu, to go. They handed me a big bag full of a basic salad on one plate and a styrofoam container full of the gyros meat, two slices of tomato, a ton of onions, and some french fries. 

The bag also only had one pita in aluminum foil. ONE PITA! I could easily stuff three pitas with as much meat and onions as they gave me. Fortunately, that one pita was quite good. Needless to say, I ate most of my \"gyros\" dinner straight from a fork, and not with pitas but the one. It's for this reason, plus the fact that I was charged over $14 for the one meal, that I have to remove one star; otherwise this would have been a good restaurant and I would've been a fan.

I might still go back, with friends / co-workers, and ask for extra pitas."}
{"text":"This place has the best gyros around, been in business for so long and always supply you with the same good tasting gyros and fries for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Fantastic food at very reasonable prices. The inside has a great vibe and is relaxing. The Gyros and BBQ Chicken are excellent. We go here frequently and don't even bother looking for any other Greek restaurants!"}
{"text":"Great fries. Pretty good gyros, but have had better. Nice waiter. All in all good place."}
{"text":"These are the best Gyros in town or anywhere for that matter. I have been to Greece and I think they are better at Gyros Express.  I don't know how they are so good but they just are. And I honestly think their baklava is the best I've had."}
{"text":"I lived in Chicago for 10 years and since moving to AZ, I haven't found a good gyro. I tried the gyro sandwich lunch special....it was delicious. Reminded me of the gyro's I used to get in Chicago. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Wow, holy curry explosion.
I wouldn't say I'm a gyro expert but do enjoy eating them from time to time. This was my first experience with Gyros Express and I don't think I will be going back. 
The price seemed a little high and although the gyro was full of meat, all I could taste was curry... and I like curry. Just not an entire spice rack full.
Definitely not what I was hoping for."}
{"text":"No frills, no fuss, just a darned good gyro.  And a good value - $8.95 for lunch includes gyro, fries, and drink.  I do wish I'd subbed a side salad for the fries.  I would definitely eat here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Not much for atmosphere, but there is a reason they have been here for so long. Fantastic Gyro meat, and their lunch special which includes a Gyro, fries and a drink for only $8.95.

Glad I found this little lunch spot."}
{"text":"Great Gyros!!  atmosphere is a bit boring, but hey, the food is what you come for :-)  Very nice people that are there, both staff and many long-time customers."}
{"text":"I got the gyro and fries for lunch and it was good but overall this place just wasn't up to par and I probably wouldn't return. 

Pretty shabby looking, and I get it's a mom and pop place, but still they could do better with updating the table cloths and menus. Everything was worn. 

Service was slow but the guy working was really trying his best to serve everyone. There was another guy in the kitchen I think but only one guy on the floor. It was decently full for lunch so I would think maybe at least two people would be around. But hey, the actual server was nice and did as much as he could. 

Again, the food was good but nothing special. I would probably never think to come here again. Lots of people coming in for takeout though, so maybe that's the route to go. If you want to grab some Greek to go, I would try it out."}
{"text":"Very welcoming and friendly staff. This is another unassuming restaurant serving delicious food at a reasonable price. I had the lamb and beef and shawarma and it was delightfully well seasoned and  served with plenty of meat.

I also had a chicken shawarma to go but I did not like it as much and I did not care for the use of dry spices.

This is a family owned restaurant and despite its rustic look, the food is what won over my palate."}
{"text":"Not one complaint, will be stopping by quite often as they're close by to work. Although within the area there are many great choices, this family-owned place is unique and delicious. Great, friendly staff, DELICIOUS and nice selection, good prices, good recommendations...my kind of place. I dig the whole family owned, home-made/influenced type restaurants."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, and the service was great. I love to go to a family run place. They were kind enough to steer my order to fit my appetite. The reason my review is not 5 stars is because the atmosphere is a bit dark. However, it felt great to get out of the hot sun."}
{"text":"Absolutely  the best place I've ever eaten at. Hands down if I could give it 5 more stars I would. I always order the gyro plate or sandwich and fries and let me tell you not only is the service fast, friendly, and family orientated but the meat and pita were warm and quite tasty. Taziki sauce was authentic and a perfect top of to the meat and I also like it with my french fries as well. All in all I will bring my my friends and family to this place. Hats off to you all at GYROS EXPRESS"}
{"text":"11am and place just opened. This is second time in a row I've been there at 11am  and the Gyros and Fries were really good and fresh. I did take out both times and service was good."}
{"text":"been coming here on and off for many years. Very consistent food at a reasonable price and nice sized portions. I usually come for lunch and sometimes can get a little busy. everything I've had there is on point."}
{"text":"This place has excellent gyros and the pitas come stuffed with enough gyro meat to make two gyros almost. The tzatziki sauce is also very good with the sandwich. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a good gyro sandwich."}
