{"text":"Great food. Quick preparing time. Decent prices. Friendly staff. Nice decor. I have nothing bad to say. I'll be back,"}
{"text":"Previously known as Pho Phuong... With new management the restaurant has taken a makeover. The inside decor has been replaced and is a nice place to take a date or a friend. A very clean place makes me more comfortable about the food!  Ordered the standard Pho and was surprised that the broth tasted better than the previous owner's: cleaner, tastier. Service was good for a non-busy afternoon. The only complaint was that they charge $2 for tea, who does that anymore?  Food:4 Service:3 Ambiance: 4 Overall: 3 of 5 stars"}
{"text":"Kind of gross pho... Good for a quick fix but be prepared for your meal to taste like it came out of a food court. The rare beef pho was lacking the last time I was here so this time I tried the shrimp with vegetables. The shrimp at least seemed like it had been cooked fresh. The broccoli on the otherhand was yellow, and the only decipherable spice in the broth was salt. Yikes."}
{"text":"This place is poop. My pork chop was burned and over salted and my fried egg was full of shell. Head over to Ossington for excellent Pho."}
{"text":"Definitely not a return customer and I live only a block away. They have less than stellar food and service. I've been there a total of 2 times and have regretted going in each time, so never again for me. There are far better options a few blocks down on Ossington or in Chinatown."}
{"text":"This is a really good option for Vietnamese - fast service, clean, modern decor, good food and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Actually it's still own by the same people.they redecorate it,the menu is more simple & still great as before,the broth is cooked in the same special way they always have.Im a regular customer,it's great for fun nights espcially now that it opens late on Thursday Friday& Saturday because of the bar!!!"}
{"text":"I eat here about once a week. Why? cause the price is right, plus I work close by and and the food? Pretty damn good. I love their house vermicelli (11) and raw beef pho with beef balls. (sm 650) oh and their deep fried spring rolls (4) oh and for the love of goodness congee (9) is damn good (although it's quite easy to make) I've never had a problem ordering take-out and dining in during lunch the cooking machine that is the lady at the back has your dish ready in under 10 minutes.   If you are on Queen St. W looking for some Vietnamese food, give this place a try."}
