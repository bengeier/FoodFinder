{"text":"2 words.. The Combo.. Italian beef and Italian sausage.  I ventured into this place as a semi regular to Las Vegas and discovered Soups.  I highly recommend this spot. Chris (lil soup) the owner/operator is not only a gr8 go-to person in Vegas but makes a mean sandwich .. Again.. Get The Combo!"}
{"text":"I love this spot. I usually get the quarter pound hot dog with grilled onions but the pork chop sandwich is really good too. The prices are very reasonable for the food you get plus the guys are really nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm quite disappointed. It's REALLY hard to screw up a pizza puff.  Unless your grease isn't kept at a high enough temperature. Nothing worse than bringing home 2 grease soaked puffs.... I gave 2 stars in hopes they serve a decent beef; I won't be back to try"}
{"text":"I have tried to eat here 3 times now 11:00/11:30/11:50, and they have yet to be open on time. Food looks good in the pics, but I couldn't tell you because I can't get any of it. Probably won't come back!!! 3 strikes your out!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in there today and had the Italian Combo.  It was awesome.  My daughter's had the hot dogs.  We loved it.  Great place to eat if you want something quick and want to be in and out in minutes!"}
{"text":"This place does not exist! It is a gas station set up for food but doesn't have any! What a joke! Im really mad that I drive all the way here - thanx a bunch Yelp!"}
