{"text":"Shittiest fast food place on earth! I had a Poutine and I wasn't able to finish it, at all. The fries were old and dry, the sauce was horrendous, I think it was even expired.   Not only the food was garbage but the place was dirtier than a manufacture. Seriously I can't believe they dare selling such crap to people, I can't believe this place is still open. Pure shit!"}
{"text":"No complaints! It's a no-frills casse cro√ªte with traditional fare: burgers, poutine, pizza etc. A bonus is the Haitian daily meals. I was offered a chicken leg on the house once when I ordered fast food and it was really tasty. They are also one of the only places open late in the area. There is a poutine restaurant nearby but I actually prefer to come here. More cheese and sauce and way cheaper. Works for me!"}
{"text":"Probably the best poutine in La Petite Patrie  Though I am a devout La Banquise disciple when it comes to my favourite poutine, there are times when I just don't want to venture in that area of the city, nor put up with the crowd that's there. I have tried a great many poutine places in La Petite Patrie and Jojo's is by far the best one.   At first glance, this joint (I'm not trying to sound hip by calling it a \"joint\", but if you've seen this place, you know it's not worthy of being called a diner, it's strictly a joint) is not your kind of place that you'll willingly chose to go to. It's hot in there and though passable, I wouldn't say it's a clean restaurant. And they change waitresses more often than they change their deep-frying oil. But for some reason the food turns out amazing and the cooks are always nice and amicable. There are a slew of hipster poutine restaurants in La Petite Patrie where you get rude, pretentious service and a fat bill at the end of your meal and Jojo's just the complete opposite. Down to earth, unpretentious and understated. And the prices are most reasonable. I urge everyone who reads this not to judge this restaurant by its cover and give it a chance."}
{"text":"This Quebecois PizzAria features 34 types of poutine!   Some of the offerings have the traditional gravy, the rest have Italian meat sauce on it.  I ordered the JoJo Special with gravy at 2am (they're open until 4am).  Yum!  Here is Jojo's website: http://www.restojojo.com"}
