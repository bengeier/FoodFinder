{"text":"Wonderful flavorful appetizers prepared skillfully. Seafood linguini may have a bit more hot pepper flakes than some would tolerate but it was fine for my palate. Generous with the crab and the prices for their drinks and desserts are very fair. They locally source their ingredients when at all possible. This is a find"}
{"text":"Great breakfast but a little overpriced! Defiantly suggest the Pittsburg Breakfast! Comes with a good amount of sides for $13. Breakfast doesn't come with the hotel room which was surprising. They have a good looking breakfast buffet for $9.50 or $15 (depending on size of buffet you chose). Took quite a long time to get our food considering there were very few people there. Overall had a good experience!"}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh this week and I stayed at the Double Tree hotel where this restaurant is located.  When you are on the road, it is really a plus to have a good restaurant right where you are sleeping.   I had one dinner and two breakfasts here.  Dinner the first night was fabulous - I had a beef soup that tasted homemade, I even remarked to the server that the broth tasted like my wife's gravy.  For my main dish I had linguine with crab meat, shrimp and scallops plus peppers and garlic.   I always seek out pasta/shrimp dishes and this one was one of the best.  I was the only person in the dining room for quite a while as not too many people travel here for business on January 2nd, so needless to say the service was superb.  My two breakfasts were delicious, Denver omelet with a side of ham, English muffin and cranberry juice.  Hot and fresh and served with a smile.  Great way to start the day.  If you are traveling here I recommend eating here as well.  Food is great and the prices reasonable, no expense report problems."}
{"text":"I stayed with some friends at the DoubleTree this past weekend. We dined at Share for Dinner and I ordered the Heirloom Tomato and Mozzarella Flatbread It was quite good and filled me up and was reasonably priced. But we came down for Breakfast under the idea that the Breakfast Buffet was included in our room rate as one of our group was told it was free. So yes when given our bill we were a bit shocked that it was not included but also that it was $12 for the Buffet. I only had the make your own waffles and fresh cut fruit and a muffin and juice so for me who does not eat meat I was quite surprised that it did cost that much. Never less everything was very good tasting but it would be very good to put a sign up before you come in or somewhere on the DoubleTree website that Breakfast is not included in your room rate. Also I understand their was a large group staying at the hotel that weekend and thus the restaurant was busy in the morning but I feel the Service could be better. While we were seated for breakfast another group came in to get seated and one lady was using a knee walker and was clearly disabled yet she was expected to be seated far from the buffet while their was clearly a open but dirty table right next to us right up front and still no one told this woman she could sit there and clean it off for her. It was not till after the lady left clearly upset did someone finally clean the table."}
{"text":"This will be a two fold review.  As a restaurant, it offers your standard Hotel Restaurant breakfast (albeit a bit more sophisticated).  Standard offerings such as cereal, breakfast pastries, waffles, and pseudo-eggs (I'll pass), but also the surprise of the morning, an omelette chef serving up quite a surprise (easily the best hotel omelette I ever had...  interpret that).  As a bar, Share represents a great (and only) option for Double Tree patrons that can't/wont venture out.  A few decent taps (Magic Hat, etc.), some decent bottles (Dogfish), and a good enough liquor selection to please most palates.  I'll give extra props for the bar staying open well after their posted 1am closing time (though then again, the 30 or so people we brought with us made it a quite profitable and easy decision for them)."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh for Schenley's Class of 1966 Reunion. I'm staying at DoubleTree and have had all my meals at this restaurant. Everything is good and the service is the best."}
{"text":"I ate here twice for dinner while staying at the Doubletree Hotel. We have experienced the Meatloaf and the Ribeye entrees, the meatloaf was pretty good (I would rate it 3.5), but the Ribeye was really lacking in flavor and had a sweet marinade that I did not care for (2). We have also had several Small Plates, both the mushroom flatbread (1) and meatball flatbread (2) were really dry and disappointing. The hummus appetizer (4) seemed freshly-made and was very good, and the Polish food sampler (4) was also one of the better dishes we had. To sum it up, the food is really hit or miss, and the wine list is lacking (for me, the house wine on HH special is undrinkable), and everything was over-priced. I would avoid going out of my way to eat here, but it would be fine in a pinch."}
{"text":"Ehh...not impressed with this place. The service an atmosphere was very relaxed and nice after a long day. But, the food was not worth the price. It's a pretty pricey place with not a ton of options. I just ordered a burger and fries for $15. It was the most dry burger I have ever had, would have rather gone to Red Robin down the road.  I would suggest this place for drinks only."}
{"text":"Food is excellent.  Ordered hummus as an appetizer and chicken with pea and mushroom risotto.  The hummus was very tasty and not too garlicy.  The chicken and risotto was excellent.    The main problem with Share -- preventing me from giving five or even four stars -- is the service.  It was around 8pm and the place was pretty empty.  Only about four or five tables with at least that many servers.  We were seated, got the wrong menus and were finally able to order about 20 minutes later.  The hummus came out pretty fast but then began the long wait for our food -- at least 40 minutes.  After eating, we were then given the wrong bill.  We should have just paid it and left (as it was $15 less than ours) but honesty won out.  Our server did not come back and I eventually had to walk over to the other two standing by the kitchen and tell them that we got the wrong bill.  She brought over the correct bill and then left for another 10 minutes before coming back to take our credit card.  Did I mention that there were only 2 other tables by then.  A dinner that should have taken an hour took almost 2.    Food was very good though."}
{"text":"Opted for a place close by on the way to a movie at the Monroeville Mall.  This restaurant is in the Double Tree Hotel.  It's a nice enough setting, though we appeared to be the sole diners at 5:30pm on a Wednesday evening.    The menu consists of mainly small bites (appetizers/tapas) and some entrees.  We elected to go with the small bites to share and ordered the hummus, bruschetta, and shrimp.  All were tasty and quite enough to fill us, though I will ask the inevitable question that I see happen at restaurant after restaurant -- why, oh why, do you INSIST upon setting out a disproportionate number of xxx (in this case shrimp) for your guests? I swear I think you do this on purpose for the pleasure of seeing your guests fight over the remaining xxx (again, shrimp in this example)...  Sigh... it just seems unnecessary.  The shrimp came 3 to an order for 2 of us...  Do you not see an issue here?  They were tasty.  Whatev.  I give up.    Final words -- food was pleasantly arranged on the plate, our server was pleasant and engaging, and all was good."}
{"text":"Will have to give it 3 stars.  Had the meatloaf.  A bit salty, but a good portion for the price.  Also poor beer selection.  Could use one or two craft beers on draft."}
