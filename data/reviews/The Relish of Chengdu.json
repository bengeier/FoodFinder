{"text":"The place is quite small and there's only a few tables for seating. The staff is polite, but they don't speak English and their menu is absent of English as well. 

Price: $4-6 for a dish. 

Portions: Closer to \"appetizer\" sized, but definitely worth $6. 

Dumplings: Imho the best dish they have. 

Dan Dan Noodles: Absent of peanuts and flavoured with spice, it was also delicious. 

Cold Noodles: Too typical to stand out. Flavour was good, but lots of places do it better. 

Hot & Spicy Noodles: Unique, spicy, and more on the sour side. 

I did not get to try their red sausage or their dessert dish, but I'd definitely give it a go next time."}

{"text":"Noodles are very authentic and flavourful. Place is small and it looks like they don't have an English Menu, so you just have to rely on the pictures. Staff was nice but they don't seem to speak English. 

We got the cold noodles (2 types - an egg noodles with chilli sauce and a clear mung bean noodle with chilli sauce) both very flavourful but I preferred the egg noodles. Also got the dan dan noodles - it was spicy and there wasn't any peanuts, different style I guess? Still was good. We also tried their dessert which was also very unique, it was a jelly with raisins, pumpkin seeds and Chinese rice wine. It was refreshing after the spice and it had a very unique flavor."}
{"text":"I really love the idea of The Relish of Chengdu: a business that replicate the cuisine of Chengdu in GTA.

The business is small with limited items available but it is just like home cooking. 

Their hot sauce is spicy with a nice flavour....

But why the 1 star? 

I got this Szechuan Cold Noodes ($4.99) and I found a piece of hair in the sealed package of noodle......"}
