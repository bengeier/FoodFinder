{"text":"Their spicy fries noodles are amazing. Great service too. I really enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"Just ordered takeout for lunch from Fresh Rolls for the first time, and must say I am a fan! I've lived and worked nearby for a couple years but never actually tried this place out until now. I ordered the Beef Express Lunch Special, and the portion size was great. Beef was tender and delicious, the salad had just enough dressing on it, and the Imperial Roll was so good. They gave plenty of rice, however it would have been nicer (in my opinion) to have more salad and less of the jasmine rice, although it was tasty. I personally didn't try the Coconut Soup, but I know my co-workers love it. Will definitely return to try out some more of their dishes :)

...Oh, by the way, to the reviewer 'Krista' who claims she got sick from the food here - you do not get sick from food poisoning DURING your meal... generally symptoms arrive hours after, even days. So the fact that you got sick at the restaurant in the middle of your meal suggests that perhaps something you had eaten earlier in the day, or even days ago, made you feel ill. Just my two cents :)"}
{"text":"l went there today after shopping at Sherway.  After the waiter sat me down, he forgot about me.  Before  l left in frustration l watched him take a 5 dollar bill out of the tip jar and put it in his pocket.  Left angry at myself for not informing the other server."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Not authentic. No pho.

Would not go back to this restaurant. There is more options out there that have better food and better price."}
{"text":"A Viet restaurant without Pho??? Not a good start, but the rest of the food was decent.  The food was fresh and pretty authentic. Prices were a bit higher compared to other Viet-Thai joints but that could be because of the location (Chapter plaza across Sherway Garden). Glad we tried it but not sure if I would go back."}
{"text":"I don't know what prompted me to stop in here for take out a few years ago, but I've done it several times since. I don't get out to it very often but I'm always glad I did. Everything is so good! So fresh! So yummy!

The staff are really welcoming and helpful. Ive observed that they give the same courteous service to couples, singles and families with little ones. Take out is efficient and always wonderful.

Something taking you to Etobicoke? Hungry after shopping at Sherway and all you see is mcdonald's and strip mall cuisine? Now you've got a reason to be glad to be in the suburbs. Definitely check them out!"}
{"text":"I recently started a job right near Sherway Gardens, and there definitely is no shortage of lunch options nearby. I almost didn't even see Fresh Rolls, as it's a tad hidden across the street from Sherway, but I'm glad I found it.

The inside is very spacious, nicely decorated, and relaxing. I went during a big snowstorm, and it was especially nice watching the snow fall out of those large windows.

I opted for my ever-so-predictable chicken pad thai, which was perfectly acceptable, but nothing amazing. The server was friendly as well. They also had tv's playing CP24 at both ends of the restaurant, which I thought was more of an annoyance than a bonus. It just seems out of place here.

I'd return, but won't be sitting near the TV."}
{"text":"this place is great and very friendly! the fresh rolls are amazing.I really enjoy their food! i love that they carry fresh chilli peppers"}
{"text":"I don't understand why people keep coming back here. How has Canyon Creek run out of business before this sad excuse of a restaurant? Rude service, mediocre food, and cheap decor. 

The waitress talked down on me when I asked for add-on options then tried to over charge me for it. She frowns deeply at everything and glares at people behind the cash counter.

 The hargow were still frozen on the inside when served, and a bit sour. Everything was overly greasy and the oil isn't fresh. 

Price here can only be charged for what it is because of its proximity to Sherway."}
{"text":"This place has been consistently delicious for the last 7 years! I crave their red curry and fresh rolls and have been coming here several times every year. It may be a little more pricey than other viet/thai restaurants but a couple of bucks extra is well worth their reliability in serving delicious, spicy dishes that I can rely on when I bring out of town guests and colleagues here. The nicer decor make it a great business lunch option too.  The tables have nice white tablecloths and as an extra bonus, there is lots of free parking all around it. I upgraded my ranking to 5 stars from 4 because of their consistency and my increasing appreciation for their food."}
{"text":"This is a good example of a place I would visit more often. The prices are expensive. 
Food has been good, 30 plus for 2 without drinks, expensive."}
{"text":"Stepped inside fresh rolls not expecting a lot. Good reviews on yelp and decided to get the Golden tofu curry as a precious review said it was good. Was not disappointed. Good size with a side of coconut rice. I personally spent an additional 3 dollars for coconut rice rather than jasmine but the Golden curry was awesome. 
Atmosphere is nothing special. This place is best for quick bite. 
The food was extremely hot. I could tell that it is made to order. I could barely eat it for 5 minutes because it kept burning my mouth. Which is good or bad depending on how hungry you are. 
Good price, good food, fast service. If I am hungry for Thai curry and I'm in the area I would go again."}
{"text":"After a nice long walk by the beach (Sunnyside Park) around 2:30pm on Saturday Jan. 3rd, my boyfriend and I wanted something delicious to eat so I googled this place and it sounded perfect!

We got there and noticed a bright sunny place FILLED with live plants. There was 2 other couples in there so it was not busy at all.

The young guy dressed in jeans and a t-shirt was at the other end of the restaurant. He didnt say hello or smile to us and didnt even make it the 10 feet to walk over just asked us \"for two?\" I smiled and said yes... he walked away from me and went to stand by a table at the other end of the restaurant. I mustve looked confused for a moment because he said - almost at a yell \"come!\" to us. 

We sat down with our menus and we noticed that we had just arrived 2 minutes after the lunch specials. We are not jerks, we didnt bother asking and just looked at the dinner/regular menu. The same man took our drink order ($2.50 pot of weak bag green tea for me and a mango juice for my bf - was good, sweet and syrupy but definitely not freshly juiced) then proceeded to sit down at another table and fold napkins. 

We were waiting to place our orders and wondering how we should get his attention while out pops another very friendly man in all black with a servers apron at his waist.

We ordered fresh rolls, mango salad and deep fried pork and shrimp wontons to start. The rolls were just good. The mango salad was okay ...it looks like a huge portion but its on a big bed of iceburg lettuce. The wontons were good as well. Just good, nothing to complain about but nothing to rave about either. 

Issues: My boyfriend ordered SF6 which is described as BATTERED and deep fried tiger shrimp with veg. it is very similiar to SF5 but the shrimp are not battered. 
I ordered the chicken and shrimp pad thai. His shrimp were exactly like mine and so we asked the first guy who dropped off our plates. He insisted yes they were battered and when I politely pushed it he walked away and said \"you should try it\".

As I said before we arent difficult diners. But this guy was just rude from the beginning and turned our entire dining date off from the moment we walked in. At one point the entire kitchen staff (2 people) and the 2 servers sat down at a table and ate while we had to repeatedly ask for water. 

The food was okay/good. Just very pricey. Even my green tea which was a tea bag in boiling water - I SWEAR you get that for free at other places. $3 extra for coconut rice when the entree is already $13+

I thought the portions wouldve been a bit bigger, family style so we could share but my pad thai was small and ketchupy. 

Not a horrible place to eat but we wont be going back so hence the \"Meh. Ive experienced better\" yelp rating."}
{"text":"Fresh Rolls is a small restaurant with a variety of Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese dishes. It is a great place to go for a respite from box stores and the massive mall in the area! The staff are very friendly and service is quick. We usually get soup (coconut) and a few appetizers. It's more than enough food for my wife and I. More importantly, it ends our shopping trip which are normally harrowing and expensive. Aside from McPigs, not many affordable restaurants in the area. 
Just read a comparison with Panera (which seems healthy and is across the street) and the Dirty Clown. Many of the Panera dishes were actually higher in calories than a Big Mac! 
Good little place and we like to support local businesses whenever possible. Tasty food all around."}
{"text":"Great Thai and Vietnamese food. Their rolls are the best anywhere. Ginger tea is great too. Fast, efficient service and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I seriously don't know how people are raving about the fresh rolls. 

Stopped in for a quick snack, and figured a place called Fresh Rolls must have great fresh rolls...yeah, no. They are the most boring, bland fresh rolls I've ever had. We ordered both the shrimp and vegetable version. They both had vermicelli, lettuce, mint and the protein. That's it. Shrimp and tofu, if you're wondering. Neither protein was seasoned or tasty. The accompanying peanut sauce was good though. What else would I expect? Maybe some matchstick mango, carrot or cucumber. Some seasoning. Flavour, perhaps?

We also ordered a small vegetable coconut soup. Also bland. I'll take partial blame for expecting it to be a typical Thai (curry) coconut soup, as this is a Thai restaurant. It wasn't. Just lots of broccoli and bok choy swimming in plain watery coconut milk. 

I doubt I would come back, but if I did, I would try something else and see if it is any better."}
{"text":"This little place is another gem I seem to have overlooked for some reason, although I drove by it many times I never once went in to try it out.

First of all the interior is much more spacious then it looks outside and the decor has a unique charm to it. Still not being a huge establishment but with enough space to be comfrortable as the layout is designed well with decent spacing between tables and a nice little patio for extra seating. Lush greenery also help the ambience here, I found the interior welcoming and cozy but also very clean.  The service is what really blew me away though, I went in with a coffee and was asking the server if they had a garbage for me to throw it out in and he thought that's all I wanted but still obliged as pleasantly as if I were a regular. So he escorts us to our seat; table cloth and everything on it, including salt & pepper shakers were spotless. The menu, though extensive was well organized, easy to read and understand with a huge variety of menu items including all mannor of juices and the full selection of pop brands (eg/ coke, pepsie, sprite, 7up etc) which is a big deal to some of my friends who ONLY drink one of the brands religiously. On the menu there is also a section were you can get a meal deal and usually places just offer a special price however here they seem to also pair up the menu items to compliment each other creating delicious and afforable meal options. 

I ended up ordering the Fresh Rolls with shrimp for an App and they were some of the best I have EVER had, I am a real fan of the fresh roll but here they seemed so fresh and extremely large in portion as well, great for sharing. My entree was the Golden Curry Chicken and I substituted coconut rice for an extre 3$... was it ever worth it!!! My new FAV dish, it was rich, flavorful with just the right amount of spice and the coconut rice really added the extra touch to the meal. My boyfriend ordered Cashew Chicken which he adored as well and had another excellent portion too..another important thing to mention would be the presentation. My dish came in two seperate bowls, almost traditional for curry it seems and his had the most beautiful array of vegetables cut in different textures making the dish look very interesting. The wait for the food was incredible, it wasn't that busy when we came but anyone who was there seemed to get their piping, hot food fast and recieved it with as large a grin as we had. Another thing to mention would have to be the parking... ample parking with a private lot as well always impresses me, I think there is little worse then having to pay to go pay to eat/drink.

Over all I would have to say I am absoutely thrilled with this lovely little place; the service and food were so outstanding that I am bound to be back over and over again... a little note, I have been back several times for take out and I just can't get enough of the place."}
{"text":"Props to them for maximizing their profits and being successful for years. This place has been here for quite a while. Way over priced, but there are no real viet places nearby, so they can charge double the price and get away with it. And any thai places nearby are quite terrible. I had the grilled chicken on rice, a typical dish that costs $8, but here its $14 and way smaller portions. Tasted only ok.  I will never ever go back to this place, but this place isnt for asian ppl. This place is clearly for white and non asians."}
{"text":"In truth this is more of a 2.5, not terrible but no reason to go back.

Walking through the narrow doorway I was encouraged to see white table cloths and be greeted by a friendly server. 

We ordered a beef dish and a tofu vegetarian dish and found not had virtually the same ingredients. The beef plate had plenty of somewhat tough meat in a mildly tasty sauce. The tofu dish had just three shrivelled pieces of tofu and tons of the same vegetables form our other plate."}
{"text":"When I first stepped inside I didn't expect a good experience. Could barely understand our waiter but that wasn't a problem. I ordered the Pattaya chicken and was blown away. The flavors mixed so well today and you could tell that all the ingredients were fresh. Though my only gripe is that the portions are small compared to the price you pay."}
{"text":"My food did not taste good. It did not even close to taste sweet and sour, moreover it was so expensive considering portion and taste wont go back. Thai express is so much better than this place."}
{"text":"This place does a really good job of looking like a Vietnamese restaurant....but the similarities end there. The Pho is a disaster. Store bought vegetable stock, previously cooked beef of some sort and a pound of celery and broccoli. Extremely small portion for $11. Would have sent it back but what else could they possibly give me? Terrible spring rolls in a fried wrapper I couldn't get my head around. Bill with a coke came to $21.74. Left the place feeling robbed. 

And they don't do chopsticks.....bring your own. How is this place open?"}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad. The chicken on rice was good, actually, but the service was lacking. They're understaffed. I came in during lunch (1:15pm) hoping for a quick meal but everything came really slow, and with a large gap between the starter soup and the main (20 minutes or more apart). Paying also took long. Observing them you can see that they are heavily understaffed or work inefficiently. I recommend going at off peak hours. It's a family run business."}
