{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in town and it never fails me.  Service is always top notch.  I like sitting at the counter watching the food come out.  If you feel like indulging, try the Monte Cristo. Its a turkey, ham, and swiss sammy in french toast batter deep fried.  Dipped in syrup and you're in heaven!!  If you feel like a healthier option, go for the Veggie Benny.  Avocado, spinach, grilled tomatoes, two poached eggs smothered in hollandaise.  One of the best benedicts I've ever had!"}
{"text":"We had the best breakfast we've had in a long time you have your choice of coffee cake or toast the coffee cake is fresh and with the right sweetness the skillets are da bomb I changed my veggies skillet to egg whites and sweet potatoes instead of breakfast potatoes my man got steak and eggs with a side of biscuits and gravy everything was amazing including the service Cindy was greAt she was very patient and attentive my glass was never empty and I'm a drinker I drink a bout five glasses of water throughout one meal at least or more lol we were so full but very happy"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great cafe off strip, I highly recommend The Cracked Egg. Excellent service, prices are commensurate with the quality and quantity of food."}
{"text":"Expect this place to be packed EVERY SINGLE time you visit. The food is that good. The coffee cake alone is worth the wait."}
{"text":"No worse customer service than having your customer ask what kind of juice do you have and the server pointing to the menu and replying it's on the menu!!  Seriously?!!!! Okay food and bad server."}
{"text":"Place is packed, I got in in about 15 min. Tori's Tortilla was was super great. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is great! Definitely try the coffee cake. It's amazing! I also love the biscuits and the omelets. My mom visited a while back and she had the eggs Benedict. One of the best she's ever had!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! Casual atmosphere and good food. Veggie Benny is YUM!"}
{"text":"Ill give it up for this place I had to drive a little out of the way and the wait was about 15 minutes but it was a Sunday. As soon as I ate the food the it was well worth both. The staff was friendly had good timing on check ups and the food was amazing fresh and didnt take too long. Pricing was great for the amount of food you got. I would definitely come back and recommend this place."}
{"text":"What's not to like about this local b'fast spot. Walked in and it was busy (+). Got seated right away and the server, Alice, could not have been nicer or more attentive from start to finish. I made a few adjustments to a menu item - which she accommodated without a blink. Service was brisk, refills often and prices fair.  She also recommended the homemade (and served warm) coffee cake instead of toast - bonus round. I like that they only do b'fast and lunch and shut it down at 2pm (weekdays) - stick with what you know and do it well."}
{"text":"First and foremost, get the seasoned potatoes! They are the business.  Kalila and I came here on Valentine's day morning and the place was packed.  Kalila really enjoyed The Green Scrambler. I don't remember if that's the right title, but it was the last item on the SCRAMBLERS section of the menu. It had spinach, broccoli, and other vegetables in it. She was so happy with her choice!  I had the big bad wolf. It is the equivalent of a meat lover's pizza, but for an omelet. There's bacon, ham, sausage....  Everyone has to try to coffee cake side at least once (served as an option next to buttered toast)  This place is always busy and plenty of times there will be a wait. The time you lose in the wait, you make up for in how quickly your food comes out.  All of my servers have always been very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I consider this place the dependable breakfast spot.   Food is always consistent. It doesn't blow your skirt but, but you're never disappointed.   Atmosphere is really a mom and pop feel.   Service is quick, burn em and turn em."}
{"text":"This breakfast spot is out of my way but I don't mind making the drive because the food and coffee are amazing. I love their California omelet and their breakfast potatoes! Definitely worth trying!!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb dot com!!! My fat friends and I where going to make breakfast at home but then we where like nah so we went to babystacks but the wait was 45 minutes long!?!?? I'm telling you, we are fat. Ain't nobody got time for that! We wanted to eat already so we came here instead.   We where seated as soon as we got there and server was nice and the food was so good! My adventurous friends got the monte cristo which was good and I got the Mexican skillet for my messican self and it was perfection.    I'll probably be here again next week."}
{"text":"I was really hoping for this place to be good, too bad I didn't even get to eat. My girlfriend, uncle and I were seating down waiting to get service but that service never arrived. We waited for at least 13 minutes and no one ever came to ask us if we needed? water, food or anything. If they would have been busy or if there would have been not enough employees, I would understand. But that was not the case, they had plenty of workers and the place was not full at all. Every body else around us were getting served no problem, we decided to leave since no one really cared to talk to us. When we were walking out, no one and if there was anything wrong or anything, they just looked at us like whatever. Total disappointment, I will tell all my friends and family about the lack of service"}
{"text":"Wait time on a Saturday morning was only 10 mins,  SCORE !!   The food: Must try: Blueberry Coffee Cake - Not overly sweet, very moist and yummy in your tummy.  County Fried Steak -  Pretty darn scrumptious.  Even bite was a home run! Pass: Peanut Butter French Toast - The bananas on top were over ripe (not something I enjoy), and with the syrup, made this sickeningly sweet."}
{"text":"If you're on the highway and need a place to stop, great diner. Open before most other locations in the area. Food is good, not life changing."}
{"text":"Come here every time we visit Vegas! The gluten free breakfast options are amazing. Emily was our server this time. She was exceptional. We came yesterday and told her we would be back today. She remembered our drink order and what she had suggested we try the day before. She is so friendly and personable and her suggestions were great! Thank you Emily!"}
{"text":"Was pretty disappointed with this place.  My aunt had been raving about this place so maybe my hopes were too high.  Prices were a little much.  6.75 for 2 eggs, toast, and a small coffee.  I ordered the French Toast and a chocolate milk.  The toast was soggy, even the crust.  The chocolate milk tasted like hershey's syrup mix but watered down.  I also tried a couple bites of the huevos rancheros which actually wasn't too bad.  flavors were very bold and quite yummy.  The only thing is that it lacked texture and just felt like mush in your mouth.  Service was good; timely and waitresses were friendly.  I'd probably check this place out again to try something else that would hopefully change my view of this place, but very sparingly considering the prices."}
{"text":"We had a very disappointing meal this morning. Blueberry pancakes were very dry (to the point of being very crumbly) and did not have any flavor. Banana chocolate chip pancakes were not much better and they forgot to put banana in the batter - served them on the side. Potato hash that came with eggs was very soggy and flavorless. Scrambled eggs were just OK."}
{"text":"I thought Cracked Egg was great. Awesome variety and really good food. The service wasn't anything to write home about, but nothing to complain about either.   My husband had the peanut butter stuffed french toast, which was tasty but became too sweet to finish.   I had the chile verde rancheros. I will definitely order this again, but it was a portion large enough for me to skip lunch because I was still full.   We also shared the coffee cake based on recommendations on Yelp, and I would skip it next time. Tasted like a cake mix...  Expect to wait on the weekends, but I thought worth it."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! Eggs Benedict were great, as was the peanut butter French toast. Service was also great!"}
{"text":"I never thought I would love peanut butter French toast..... But I do ;)."}
{"text":"The manager gave me attitude just for ordering a water with lemon and didnt acknowledge when i said thank you for serving me my drink. The waiter was sarcastic and snippy, though it may be because of his managers bad attitude. The food is amazing, as always. But who needs attitude first thing in the morning?"}
{"text":"First time here but what could possibly be bad at a place that offers you the choice between toast or frigging coffee cake!!???   BTW,  the best coffee cake  ever.   The coffee was delish too.   Just waiting for the mains to finish this place off...   They're very crowded on a late Sunday morning so service is a little slow.   OK,  wait is over food is here.....   AND IT IS GOOD.......   Gotta go...  Food calls."}
{"text":"Wow this place was super busy but are server was amazing. She had an southern accent with a heart of gold. She was so nice to our 2 year old son making us feel welcome. the food came out fast and was great"}
{"text":"I would like to say this is one amazing restaurant! Amazing quality home cooked food that is made fresh! Trust me you need to check it out! It's so hard to find a good home cooked fresh meal in this town and they hit it out of the park! This is a young family working hard for the American dream! Everyone needs to go show them support and eat their amazing food! Promise you won't be disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Yes it is busy. Get over it! You don't want to wait? Go somewhere else :) over priced? My party of two gets out of there way under twenty bucks every time. So sorry you have to pay for your family of five! News flash: it's expensive for more people wherever you go. There is only one girl I have had a problem with and recently, we have not seen her. I have never been rushed in there. We have had several different waitresses and waiters and never once have we had a problem. If you go in there acting entitled and asking six billion questions just to be a pain in the ass, I commend people for giving right back to you. Be pleasant and others will return the favor. Keep it up staff, do not let these people get to you! :)"}
{"text":"I thought Cracked Egg was very good, but not great. Good variety and good food. The service wasn't anything to write home about, but nothing to complain about either.   I had the peanut butter stuffed french toast, which was tasty but became too sweet to finish.   My wife had the chile verde rancheros. She said she will definitely order this again, but it was a portion large enough for her to skip lunch because she was still full.   We also shared the coffee cake based on recommendations on Yelp, and I would skip it next time. Tasted like a cake mix...  Expect to wait on the weekends, and note that the prices are a little high for a breakfast place, but not crazy. We'll probably come back, just not every weekend."}
{"text":"First time here. Heard so much about this place we had to try. I was, sadly disappointed. First the service was not that great. I ordered the blue berry pancakes and they were dry. I asked, twice for additional syrup and by the time I got it my pancakes were cold. They weren't that good to begin with."}
{"text":"Nice Breakfast. The jalapenos in the Southwest Scramble were just right. Not too hot and good taste.  The Coffee Cake was a good choice also.  The service was excellent.  Overall = 5 STARS"}
{"text":"Great breakfast stop. Been eating here for years and I seem to always get chicken fried steak! I highly recommend seasoned potatoes, they are amazing. Service is hot and cold but mostly hot."}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast places I've found in Vegas. Staff is friendly and food is great. Line is usually long on weekends, but they seat people quickly. Only down side is hash browns are always soggy, even if you specify you'd like them cooked crispy."}
{"text":"Well I have been here several times and the breakfast is always fantastic. But today I tried a burger. The burger looked and tasted like it was a frozen patty. No taste to it. Next time I'll stick to the breakfast items.  And yes the coffee cake is so delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here was a grate choice. Im loving the admosfier here. My server at the counter was great service with a smile loving her positive energy coming from her. Getting to injoye El Vaquero Omlete with season potatoes yummy :) I'll defiantly will be coming back with friends and family."}
{"text":"Love this place the coffe cake is so good I always come back for a slice.  The service was great at first but towards the end it could have used a little work. The manager is great though he was running food and helping with tables overall I will cone back again."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Vegas hands down. If you love breakfast, you'll love the Cracked Egg.  Had a weird experience at the Cheyenne location. Being younger, I assume that my server assumed me being young meant that I would tip her less than 20%. That was not the case as she ignored me my whole experience. I took it up to the register and the problem wasn't addressed. I got a measly senior discount. Though I appreciate a discounted check for a mediocre experience, that doesn't change anything.  Also noticed that their is an option between COFFEE CAKE or TOAST..  She insisted on just asking me what kind of TOAST I wanted. I didn't want TOAST. I wanted COFFEE CAKE and as a returning guest, I let her know that.   Other experiences at the location have been awesome. As well as the fe visits i've paid to the ANN location.  I am a big fan of their seasoned potatoes."}
{"text":"Still on the hunt for a good burger in an unassuming restaurant, I recently ventured to The Cracked Egg's Henderson location. It's been in my to-do list on my phone for a while now, pulled from some Yelp list that hasn't really brought me any real treats yet. Most people's recommendations and opinions for food are typically below my expectations, but someone has to come through right? Looks like I might have to keep going on that list.  The Cracked Egg is in a typical local strip mall and blends in with everything else from the outside like the rest of our mundane suburban locations. The inside is very open, pretty loud and not that fancy. Some breakfast themed restaurants have a slightly cozier feel than this, but in no means is it uninviting or that bad.  This restaurant is really a breakfast place, and the menu reflects that all the way; you have the full gamut of breakfast choices but I'm sure way better than anything you'd find at an IHOP. The burger options make up a very small section of the menu, with only a few choices that seem like typical offerings for a menu like this.  I went with a mushroom and Swiss burger to once again sample a baseline offering, as they don't really give you the option for a stand-out feature burger. What you're given is a pretty standard looking plate with a good sized burger, pickle wedge, lots of onion, a very large piece of lettuce and some oddly seasoned fries. The seemingly pre-made (not hand-made) patty was thin, yet juicy. It had ok flavor, but wasn't really cooked medium as I had asked. The bun was a bit thin, and made me nervous based on how juicy the burger was, but still held up through to the end. The mushrooms and Swiss both had good flavor and were welcome toppings, whereas my giant hunk of lettuce was a bit much.  As I said before, the fries had an odd seasoning on them I can't quite place. They were just ok, not that fresh and not too crispy. Overall the meal was just ok, depending on how much of a factor you consider the fries to be I don't have too much to complain about, but it just wasn't that great overall. At $8.95 it's not a horrible price, but I've had far better from some other less-than-fancy places lately that were even cheaper. If you're a breakfast lover I'm sure you couldn't go wrong here, but if you're looking for a good cheap burger in Henderson, there are much better places."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place. I will return. Had eggs Benedict and it was good. Had biscuits and gravy and it was ok. I don't hold that against them though, its hard to find really good biscuits and gravy.   Service was good, received food quickly."}
{"text":"Man o man!!!! Excellent customer service. The denver omelet tasted homemade big chunks of veggies. The hash tasted like a potato freshly grated. My server very attentive refilled my coffee before i could ask. Love it!!! I will definitely be back and bring my wife!! 100% better than the chain breakfast joints!!!"}
{"text":"Ooooooooo the coffee cake! Worth visiting for this alone! We have tried many dishes, favorite breakfast cafe."}
{"text":"I was not very impressed with this restaurant.  Prices were ok but the menu was not easy to read and highly unimpressive creations.  I may go back, then again I may not.  3 stars as I am undecided."}
{"text":"I like the Cracked Egg on Cheyanne better.    The breakfast food is definately pretty good, but every time I've tried going, the wait is horrendous (never under 20-30 minutes), AND the service is poor.  Poor as in having to go ask the hostess where's our waiter so we can at least get some water after 5 minutes at the table.   To me, that is a double whammy that is unacceptable.  Sorry Cracked Egg, I won't be coming back, at least not to this location."}
{"text":"Out-of-towner's first visit.  After the debacle that was our dinner at a downtown buffet the night before, we were particularly hoping for a good breakfast. The man-child picked out this location after looking online.   Bright and clean - we only waited about 10 min for a table. Hostess friendly. Someone stopped by right away and took our drink orders. The server came by very soon after that to make sure our drinks had been ordered and since we were first-timer's gave us time to make our selections.   Food came quickly.  I can't remember exactly what I had - something in a skillet - potatoes and eggs. Yum. Coffeecake - good but very rich and more suited to a dessert. Man-child had no problem assisting me by eating 2/3rds of it.. He had an omelette and kept saying \"I don't usually eat omelettes but this is good!\"  He already sees a return visit in his future during our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this place!   Love that they have locations around town. I try to goto one any time I eat breakfast out the house."}
{"text":"By far the best place for breakfast in the Northwest!  Great service and delicious food. We go here every Sunday and are greeted as if we are family! Love the scrambles and omelettes. South Shore, El Vaquero and GVP are among our favorites.  The coffee cake is amazing and flavored rotate.  The staff will accommodate any substitutions (fruit, tomatoes, egg whites, etc).  They have a small selection of gluten free options (muffins, etc) or you can stick to the naturally gluten free fare.  We typically indulge in the breakfast here but lunch is on point as well."}
{"text":"The North shore omelet is my favorite, and the service is excellent. A little pricey for breakfast, but worth it. For a 3 egg omelet it was huge, seemed like they must have used pterodactyl eggs. Everything was perfect, great way to start your day!"}
{"text":"The server was friendly and attentative.  Food is good.  They made the crispy hash brown just the way I liked it.  My coffee cup wasn't empty for long as they made sure I had enough.  The place is clean including the restroom which is a food sign."}
{"text":"Good food.   Fair price.  Very friendly staff Quick service"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely phenomenal. I've been here a dozen times and they never disappoint. I'm not much for eating out for breakfast but this place is the only place I will do for breakfast. 100x better than Denny's or IHOP"}
{"text":"Omg the coffee cake was delicious! Also the croissant French toast was so amazing. Not too heavy like regular French toast, and had lots of berries and bananas. The garden patch omelette was delicious. Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my most favorite Breakfast places.  I eat at this place all the time and I go to different ones all the time too.  They are very consistent - the service is good, the food is great.  I always get the same plate... Southwestern Scramble with Hashbrowns and English Muffin.  Damn that is good stuff!"}
{"text":"This is the best of the Vegas-area Cracked Eggs.  Man, I love this place.  The egg scramblers are delicious, and the peanut butter french toast is absolutely FANTASTIC.   Buttery hashbrowns are always a must.  Try it..but do keep in mind that they are a  fast-pace in and out breakfast place.  If you want to linger over a bloody mary and mimosas, go to brunch at the Bellagio or Mon Ami Gabi."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service, friendly staff. We were greeted and seated immediately. The food was great. I recommend the veggie Bennie or the pesto and feta scramble.  We had an awesome server with a big smile who made sure we were taken care of. All in all great food service and staff. U'll deff leave happy."}
{"text":"Nice place for lunch or breakfast. Has the enchilada omelette and it was great. Service was excellent also"}
{"text":"This is not the same flavor & preparation as the green valley location!! Everything was over cooked or burnt! If I didn't know better than I would never eat at cracked egg again!!! Stay away from this branch!!!! The rainbow & green valley are the best!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast joint in town.  The bacon is juicy, the eggs are fresh, the hash browns aren't overcooked, and the pancakes are always plump.  The line can get long - try sitting at the \"bar\" for a quick seat."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the sweet potato skillet, good service and a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was pretty excited that a Cracked Egg was in close by my work. Thought I'd stop in. No wait, place was pretty nice, it's newer so everything is nice and shiny. Took about less than a minute to get our drink order but over 4 to get our waitress back to our table. She was tall, thin, short curly hair. She was ok, took order, told us our food would be awhile. DOn't know why, but ours took longer than everyone around us, we just ordered eggs and bacon with toast :/  finally got our food. It was nothing special. Had better, had worse. The only saving grace was the 2 for 1 coupon. Haven't been back. Probably wont be either."}
{"text":"At The Cracked Egg, I like the breakfast food better than the lunch food. You seem to get more bang for your buck with breakfast.  I love the pesto scramble.  The coffee cake is good too but it changes daily, so be warned.    If you get the local newspaper, Review Journal, you can find a coupon for BOGO meal.  Without this coupon, I wouldn't go there.  It's a little pricey for me esp. for breakfast."}
{"text":"This is a great little local place with lots of delicious choices, good sevice and nice people!"}
{"text":"Ended up here when we discovered the Original Pancake House closed inside of Green Valley Ranch. Looks like we found the local hang out for breakfast. Large selection of breakfast items from the omelette to the pancake options and more. Have tried the scrambles, omelettes, and pancakes here now and have not been disappointed yet. Get the coffee cake instead of toast too!"}
{"text":"This location is closed.  Web site needs updating!  Five stars for experience at other locations!"}
{"text":"It has great food but the service is horrible. Go before you're hungry because it takes forever just to get drinks. I've gone twice to different locations and it doesn't change the fact that the service is horrible."}
{"text":"How many times can you say YUM during one meal? too many to count! Everything on the menu here is great. Never too much butter/oil and always leaves you full but not sick to your stomach. Waiting staff is always very nice and accommodating to all special needs.  I would recommend all of the omelettes and the french toast for first timers.  Oh and the coffee is surprisingly good. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"They should really make this place 24 hours, cause I would be here all the time! The eggs are real and not powered and the pancakes is bomb!!"}
{"text":"Seasonal Coffee Cakes...Oh My Goodness.....Love this place!  Atmosphere: It has a very upbeat vibe. The pictures on the wall sets the mood for great conversations and deep questionings...what came first ..the chicken or the Egg? Seriously, the question did come up! There are pics of chicken and eggs in the Cracked Egg, as well as the picture hanging over my table which read, \"BE NICE or LEAVE...THANK YOU\". So the atmosphere was great.   Very well Attended: We noticed that there were a lot of people there on a Wednesday morning at 9 am, which is a great sign so we ventured in. What really drew me there was the potential of having Pumpkin Coffee Cake. Unfortunately for me, that doesn't start until next month. I was informed that OCTOBER IS PUMPKIN MONTH! YaY! I'll be Back!   Fortunately for me, I did try the hot Apple Cinnamon coffee cake and that was so delicious and hot out of the oven.  I ordered a basic skillet meal which was delicious and very filling. I had to take half the food home..maybe the coffee cake was the culprit, but seriously, one must have cake first!  Wait Staff: Attentive The overall experience was really sweet. Great people watching, plenty of tables and really sweet wait staff. My coffee was always warm.. I will return for that Pumpkin Coffee Cake for sure!!   Great place..give it a try."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here.  I'd definitely go back.  The patio was nice and my Carnitas Omelet was very good.  My server was cheerful and all smiles and our coffees were topped off often."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast. It's convenient, good service, and good food.   I've been here a couple times and haven't had a bad experience yet. We're always seated quickly, granted we haven't come during peak times on a weekend so I'm not sure how busy that might get. But we've had good service each time, food has been good, some creative items on the menu, but always leave feeling good, satisfied, and loving breakfast all over again. Prices are reasonable, place is clean, I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"It's ok. Home fries were all uniform, clearly from a bag. Eggs and bacon were ok."}
{"text":"Waited 45 mins never got food! Waitress didn't check back with us! Just horrible!! Won't be back"}
{"text":"Just a great place with great people. Working man style food and it's good. Peace!"}
{"text":"The food is very unique and delicious. The hostess had an attitude about seating which sort of turned us off. Haven't been back in a while."}
{"text":"Very unprofessional front of the house staff. The girl who answers the phone was unbelievable \"hello\" that's it.wow. And they only take call ahead for parties of 8 or more.  We showed up anyway (we're a party of 6) and put our name on the list...35 min wait. While waiting we watch the hostess seat a party of 3 at a table big enough to seat 10. Who's bright idea was this. We've eaten many this in the past and never encountered this lack of professionalism. This place has been lacking big time since owners changed!!! Stupidest thing REALLY!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast and I love not having to cook breakfast. So I really love breakfast places and this is one of my favorites. I used to go here once a week on my way to class when I had more time and money but now I am reduced to going whenever I get a chance. But every time is great.  I love their scrambles and their build your own skillet options. But when I go with the skillet I end up picking too many ingredients and spending more money than I want. The scrambles they have are great especially the southside scramble.   The staff is usually really friendly and I get my food within 15 minutes of sitting down (if I know what I want when I sit down). Which is ideal for a quick breakfast when you do not have much time."}
{"text":"I had a sausage and cheese omelet and to be honest not that great not so bad I couldn't eat it but just not great."}
{"text":"Came here with Steven during our vay-cay in Vegas. Again, found out about this place thru Yelp, starving for something to eat for breakfast after over-sleeping. And again, Yelp did not fail us!  There were lots of reviews complaining about over-crowding and the place being uncomfortably jammed packed, but we didn't have that problem at all! Perhaps it was cause we came on a Tuesday morning? Anyways, wouldn't the fact that it's supposedly always crowded fact that it's a popular/awesome place to eat? I would think so!  Anyways, the food: GREAT. I ordered a Tropical French Toast while the bf got the Southwestern Scramble. Shredded coconut + macadamia pieces + bananas +french toast = freakin awesome! With the coconut and the macadamia, you really don't even need the syrup or butter! The Southwestern Scramble was delicious as well: Omelet with cheese and other yummy goodness, seasoned potatoes and sausages.  In the words of one of my friends, \"anything southwestern is good!\" And I totally agree! I also got some protien in the form of some turkey sausage patties, or was it chicken? I don't remember, but it was yummy too =]  All in all, I wish this place existed closer to home!"}
{"text":"Always go here on Sat/Sun. The wife love's it! Me, eh it's just breakfast. It's a modern diner. That's all! Not  over thought like Hash House. Breakfast/Lunch items and it's always the same. Weekends are always busy,but never have waited over 15-20 min. Just make sure to give your name to the host. Everything seems fresh. Scrambled eggs are real and not powdered like at a buffet. Service is usually very good have had 1 semi-bad one though. Never had cold food. Coffee never dry. No upset stomach. Just always consistent. Tables,seats,floor,windows,utinsels,cups,and plates are always clean. No smoking.  Some things I don't like,but still consistent. We always have to ask for more cream,sugar,and jelly. They are provided at the table just low or empty. The Steak with steak and egg's is thin. They ask you how would you like it cooked and I don't know why. Rare or Med rare is impossible. Tell them medium and it well be well done! It's just to thin! Better deals on that elsewhere. Home fries aren't fresh potatoes but the wife digs them. You are going to pay over $10 per person. Biscuits and Gravy are $10.99. I've don't think I have ever seen them over $6-7 any place else.   Overall I like it because it always the same. You no what to expect after going there a few time's. Also like I said, everything just seems fresh,and real eggs are used for everything."}
{"text":"We were looking for a close brunch place after Easter.  This was near by and had good reviews.    Staff is friendly and made us comfortable.  Had a couple items that came out wrong and they were taken care of promptly.    Overall the food was ok.  The menu is extensive and the combinations sound interesting, but none of us were won over by our meals.  Presentation is lacking, which is overlooked if the food tastes delicious, however the meals were a bit bland.  I had the Enchilada Omelet with hash browns and the coffee cake.  The sauce seemed simple and possibly was a store bought sauce, nothing stood out.  There was a fair amount of chicken and plenty of cheese, but wasn't what I thought it would be flavor wise in the end.  Hash browns were ordered extra crispy and weren't made that way.  They returned them to the kitchen and came back perfectly crisp.  The coffeecake was a nice portion, but not what I would call \"coffeecake\".  It was a chocolate chip cake about three inches high with a drizzle on top.  Kind of crumbly, but good flavor.  I'm just used to a more traditional denser cake with a heavy brown sugar crumb on top.    I asked the rest of the group what they thought and they all kind of said their meal was ok.  I would eat here again if nearby, but wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Service was fast! Food was amazing ! Price was really cheap! $22 for two meals. The place was packed but they were still quick. We were in and out in 25-35min. The staff and cook are in there A game! The eggs benne were on point!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! My husband and I like to eat out for brunch, and had tried multiple different places before we found this one. There is usually a pretty decent wait (apparently we're not the only ones who love it!), but it's worth it. They serve warm coffee cake before the meal, and it's gigantic and tasty. I typically get an omelet with hash browns, and am never disappointed. Great atmosphere, too - you don't feel too crammed in like you do at some places."}
{"text":"Cracked Egg was just in the Review Journal for having one of the best Monte Cristo's in Vegas and it is delicious! :)"}
{"text":"I am really more like a 2.5 on this one, and it really does pain me to rate it so low. The food is very good - and worth the money. As some other reviewers have pointed out, the food is priced fairly high, even for simple dishes. However, what really takes this down for me is the service. In the time we have been coming here, only one server - Indra - really qualifies as friendly. Today, our server was downright lousy. He was very inefficient - the restaurant wasn't busy, and he seemed to have no sense of order in terms of how he took care of his tables. Honestly, if the service was just a bit better, I would probably come here more often."}
{"text":"I saw this place had great reviews, however we must of went on a bad day! We were a table of 8 and went during a week day...it took over 40 minutes to get our meal! I would expect that if it were a weekend but with only 4 other tables filled with people that already had their food not sure why it took so long to cook eggs! I think what was more upsetting that 3 other tabes were filled after we got there and they got their food before we did!!! Sorry to say will not reccommend this palce. :-("}
{"text":"Always great food and always good service. I love the Chicken Fried Steak. I don't think there is a bad dish on this menu. Sucks if your with 4 or more people on the busy times , cuz you will have a 15-30 min wait. Always great if it's just your self or one other cuz you can pull up to the bar seating and have your grub with in 10-15 minutes...  This place rocks for a solid Breakfast !!!  #TheStruggleIsReal"}
{"text":"Today after church I went to have lunch with my family. Knew exactly what to order, pesto scramble, yum! Everyone's meal was delicious, expected! The service was a blessing to us. Thank you to our waitress, Tracy, for your warm smile and infectious happy attitude! Love coming here!"}
{"text":"It is a great place to eat at a reasonable price...pancakes are fluffy and delicious..."}
{"text":"The chicken fried steak is as good as anything I've ever had in Dixie, and the service was likewise. Excellent alternative to Baby Cakes, and destined to be just as famous.  Great place!"}
{"text":"Uhh... if you like cold eggs and bacon, this is definitely the place for you.   The hashbrowns were not cooked thoroughly enough.  A bit under cooked.   Prices? $23 for 2 basic dishes. Idk... is that  a good price  ya'll?    Anyways... im not interested"}
{"text":"Went to the Cracked Egg today based on the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. We arrived at 9:30 with a party of  6 and had to wait about 7 minutes. Not bad for a Sunday morning. We were promptly greeted by our waitress and ordered coffee and waters. We placed our orders a few minutes later and received our food a short time later. All the food was hot and delicious. My wife had a scramble with hash browns and coffee cake. I would highly recommend it as it wasn't to sweet. I had the kick'en potatoes and a waffle. My father in law had the homemade corned beef and said it was some of the best he's ever had. I would highly recommend the place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Today I went here for the first time. I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly all the staff were. I ordered the eggs benedict with seasoned potatoes and my boy had a kid's meal - which I also thought was a good price: $4.50 for a pancake, one egg, and a piece of bacon. And it all came out really fast. It seemed like less than 10 minutes. Everything was delicious.   We used a buy one get one coupon we found in the neighborhood newspaper that gets thrown on our lawn sometimes. I have no complaints whatsoever. Thanks."}
{"text":"This was our first time. Service was fast, I had the cowboy skillet. Very good, had to take home half it was too much. Hubby ate all his meal. I would rate this place a 8+. Enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"i been going to this place for almost 3 years.. an i always get the steak an eggs.. soo good... a great place to bring ur family too... it gets pack on weekends but it worth waiting.."}
{"text":"Meh.  It's okay.  Huevos Rancheros: The salsa is canned, the refried beans are canned, the flour tortillas are what I buy at the store.  Portion was small relative to price. The fruit side was rather paltry.   May try this place again, may not."}
{"text":"Everyone I've brought with me to this place enjoys their meal.  Haven't heard a complaint from any of my guests.  Most love the spicy skillets and burritos.  I am on a strict diet right now and I ordered an egg subsitute omelette and generally  when I order such items I doust them in tabasco...this one...I shook a little salt on it and devoured it with no sauce. First time ever.  Yum!  The prices are slightly higher than I'd like, but they provide several coupons on their website each month."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Always had prompt, competent service and the food is very good. A lot of variety. Make sure you try some coffee cake."}
{"text":"This place is usually pretty busy even during the week. However, its worth the wait. The menu has lots of tasty choices and is sure to please. I ordered the Denver omelet with breakfast potatoes and toast. The breakfast potatoes here are the best! The food was hot, fresh, and delicious.   The staff could have been more attentive. Our waiter was all over the place and rarely came to check on us granted, they were quite busy. The portions are nice, not too overwhelming. The prices are fair.   Definitely, a great place for a laid back breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Excellant breakfast, usually take my clients here prior to showing homes. would recommend number 1."}
{"text":"If I could put 0 star I would!!.. Food was without flavor, coffee tastes like water I usually out 1-2 cream without sugar but tried 3-4 still doesn't taste good added sugar still taste like dirt water, eggs lack of flavor, pancakes and waffles tastes fake like it came in a frozen box. The wait staff was unorganized and not attentive server was not friendly at all..tummy ached after eating..ambiance lacks lighting."}
{"text":"Always decent service and good breakfast food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed to find out they're pancake mix is premade! Even with my sons milk and eggs allergy they said it was impossible for them to mix some flour and water for his pancake. I might as well leave my toddler at home... My server had an attitude right away and we only saw her about twice from sit down to leave. The food was no better than a Denny's, I probably won't come back, although the coffee cake was really good. That's the only part we enjoyed"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service, the coffee was watered down... coffee cake was tasteless and my toast finally came when I was finished with my food. the chicken in the green omelet was really dry. I waved down the hostess while she was having a conversation with an employee and she put her finger up for me to wait... and she finished her conversation (which I could hear because she was a table away)... go to rise and shine, bite, crepe expectations... much better service. The server asked if everything was good. I told her no and she jumped to say have a nice day... that's it... no apology"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite breakfast place in Vegas. I usually go with a half skillet or the benedict both are delicious. Make sure to try the coffee cake they have different flavors daily and all are amazing!"}
{"text":"They are educated about Gluten and do their very best to reduce the chance for cross contamination. Ask for the GF menu. Those that don't have to eat GF were in love with their meals too! I will eat here every time I am in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg is awesome.  My favorite is the Californian Omelet.  The different coffee cake's are always a nice surprise.   We have always had prompt accurate service.  The wait is usually short even if people are waiting."}
{"text":"This place is always a treat when I can find time to get there. My best advice? Always get the daily coffee cake!! They really know coffee cake! Overall, I just really like breakfast places so when I can find a place with outdoor seating and a really good vibe, which Cracked Egg has, I tend to keep going back.  The service is always great and for the amount of people they bring in on the weekends when I go there, food comes out pretty quick!  If you come and there is a wait, it's worth it."}
{"text":"No wonder why this place is empty......The greeter didn't say good morning or even look at me service totally sucked balls.....table was dirty we just left that was enough there not getting my business!!!!!"}
{"text":"Eggs and pancakes are fine here, but I branched out to the Monte Cristo today, and it was not just not good--it was GROSS. I'm so bummed and want my money back."}
{"text":"Not bad.  A nice change from buffet breakfast at green valley across the freeway.  I'd eat here again"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast. I had the chili verde rancheros, and it was served in a skillet. The flavor, and the quantity of each ingredient was so well done, it would be very hard to beat."}
{"text":"Usually this place is good. My wife found a long black hair in her ranch dressing and not only did they not comp the meal my wife was unable to eat but we didn't get so much as an apology. Probably won't be back.  Service was poor considering there weren't that many costumers."}
{"text":"This place was an awesome family run restaurant! Our waitress (Raven) was great! We will come back next time we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Food took a long time and horrible I would not recommend this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast.  As a recent transplant to Vegas (last year), I found this local spot and have been here almost a dozen times.    First and foremost, the 3 things that bring me back are the the coffee cake, the service and the food.  The Coffee Cake is perfection..  I've had at least 4 different kinds and they're all great (although the mocha/chocolate flavor is my favorite).  Lemon and the berry flavors are great as well.  The service here is wonderful as well.  Everyone working here is very friendly, fast and very helpful.  The skillets are really good.  I get the veggi skillet and add bacon.  The Pesto Scramble is also a family favorite (egg whites only).  Half-portions on the breakfasts are available too, so I would suggest a half-size or sharing for the lighter eaters.    A definite favorite of mine so don't miss it!"}
{"text":"This was a very dissapointing experience, we went there expecting to get a good breakfast and instead found another of those places that like to make you wait.  We could see three open tables and no crowd, but were told that we had to wait 15 minutes.  So...like other places...we left.  If you are nice, ask us to wait pleasantly, we might wait.  But not when there is no apparent reason!  Wake up!"}
{"text":"Good Service. Pleasantly surprised with the food."}
{"text":"Come often and come HUNGRY. I grew up in New York coffee shops and Diners... If you want a taste of heaven, this is Vegas' answer to what you'd expect. The quality and service is excellent   The pancakes are delicious.  Very large portions. Can stand up to anything in NY! As a 25 year resident and local doctor I stand by these words. Dr. Jay Selznick.  702 436-9090. Can't wait until breakfast. Bon appetite. Drjselznick.com"}
{"text":"Went this morning for our first time and we will not return!  The food was decent.  Service was TERRIBLE!    Reading Paul W's post, it seems we had similar experiences.    Employees (from the hostess to the manager) did not create a warm and inviting dining experience.  No smiles, very curt staff , our server  acted impatient and annoyed with husband when placing his order, restaurant was freezing cold ... A/C and fans going when it is 60 degrees out;  we mentioned the cold temperature to 3 different employees and not one person offered to adjust the air ...  I was wearing a sweater and the hostess was wearing a sweater and scarf ... you would think someone would take notice!    In addition to having an awful experience ourselves, we witnessed our server display the same rude attitude toward a neighboring customer when they asked questions and sent their meal back.     Immediately following our visit, we sent an email to their \"corporate\" email address.  As I suspected, we have not received a return email or call despite providing our phone number.   It is VERY CLEAR that this restaurant does not value their customers!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good fresh tasting eggs!  The strawberry banana topped pancakes were very good!  And you even get a free scoop of ice cream with your meal Wow :) The service was exceptional- JoJo !  I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Food was good but I got really sick two hours later so it's kind of iffy... But the staff was awesome!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars even though I love the food here and come often is because of their service. The girls upfront are so rude. The servers are great. The hostess with the glasses and dark hair looks so miserable every time we come, slow or busy. We asked if we can have a booth rather than a table (I've been a hostess in fine dining for years. I know it's not a problem if the establishment isn't busy which it wasn't) she rolled her eyes and huffed and puffed as she went to go ask about another table. Today the blonde older hostess told a couple who was outside \"could you guys have gone any further?!\" The wife was flabbergasted and said \"Yeah actually I could have.\" Lolololol."}
{"text":"Manager is exceptionally defensive, servers are  inattentive and unfriendly. We were charged for  items we didn't order or receive but instead of simply apologizing, made excuses and were defensive. Prices are inflated maybe due to rent in Green Valley? Food is so-so but not worth the prices or below standard service. Coffee and bagged tea selection was ok, really only positive we can share. Plenty of other breakfast spots in town that are better for the money and service. If you do go, carefully review your check and be prepared for battle if there is a mistake."}
{"text":"I think the food is okay. Their have their own version of hash brown. It tastes good, but I like it cripy"}
{"text":"Not all it's cracked up to be!  This was our first and last time going. The service was horrible and food was mediocre! Drink order screwed up,  forgotten food (asked waitress twice where my son's food was) the only response was \"F\" bomb dropped and finally when paying bill the young lady at counter was so incredibly rude that another patron and I laughed and shook our heads. Over priced and over rated!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here since they opened. We have never had a bad experience. The food is always great and the service is always on point. I often mentioned to my husband that I never see a manager around. Everyone is dressed the same and always busy refilling coffee for customers, running food, rolling silverware, etc. The last time we were there we were checking out up front and my husband asked where the manager was. The woman who was checking us out WAS the manager!  I almost fell over. She was one I noticed refilling coffees and running food and rolling silverware! Talk about teamwork!!! I work at a restaurant where the managers won't move from the front of  the soda fountain when your trying to get drinks for your tables, much less run food or roll silver! I am so impressed with place!!"}
{"text":"Pretty big menu, and overall pretty decent breakfast...nothing crazy good here though, everything I have had is just ok. Egg works got them beat for sure! Or if you want some real solid breakfast go to the coffee cup!"}
{"text":"This place has clearly become my favorite breakfast restaurant.  The menu is unique, the coffee is great, and their signature coffee cake is warm and awesome. Service is always great as well. You know that a restaurant is good, when there is always a wait to get in."}
{"text":"Decided to try the The Cracked Egg because of their gluten-free offerings but was disappointed.  Husband & I had lunch and then gave another try at breakfast the next morning.  Not wonderful either time.  GF pancakes were not cooked all the way through leaving gooey middle.  Lunch had problems as well.  Service was not the best either."}
{"text":"Subpar food. Service was good, place is small, clean. We started off with coffee cake. It was mealy and had a dollop of extremely sweet, (powder sugar sweet) on top.  I ordered the enchillada omlete which had a scant amount of chicken in it, had a generic tasting diiluted enchillada sauce over it with sliced pepper jack cheese slices not quite melted on top. The tortilla chips were missing as was the green chili the menu promised. My husband ordered the chicken fried steak which was a pre frozen mystery meat  Pattie with gravy that he said was just ok. I guess for the high dollar amount for this meal,  Dennys is a better option. We have eaten at other Cracked eggs and have never walked away unhappy.  Walking to the register I noticed a customer's coffee cake.. it was very yummy looking, it even had struesle on top, ours did not. I asked the girl at the register about it and she said, snickering, \"yeah sometimes they come out good other times not so much.\"  I managed  restraunts in the past, I would have died of embarrassment knowing a piece of anything went out that wasn't the best! Looks like the whole place is run by 20 some things that really don't care. We obviously will not be back."}
{"text":"Try the country Benny and put some cholula on it. It's amazing. Sooooooooooo good! Also our server, Juan, was very nice and always coming to check up on us. 5 stars just for Juan!"}
{"text":"Penny was a great waitress! Food was very yummy! Chicken fried steak and the corn beef hash was great!"}
{"text":"My first trip to the Cracked Egg & it was pretty good. I have passed this place a million times & have heard of it over the years that I have lived here, but had never made it in.   So one day on a whim & the fact that I was starving, we ventured down here on a Sunday, fairly early I might add, so the wait wasn't too bad.   It was still pretty busy, which is always a good sign ;)   I perused the menu & finally decided on the Sweet potato skillet, however, I opted for ham instead of bacon. It was definitely interesting. Sweet potatoes, green apples, muenster cheese, ham, grilled onions & an egg over easy to top it off, with a side of coffee cake as well.   It was pretty good, considering the sweet potatoes could've been seasoned a little better, nothing a lil hot sauce couldn't fix though ;) I would probably order it again. The coffee cake was super moist & delicious too, and I'm not a huge coffee cake fan either.   I would definitely come back & look forward to trying some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"We had breakfast at this restaurant yesterday and it was AMAZING!!!  I had the Western omelette and it was sooo good.  The coffee cake was the best I have EVER had.  I only wish we had one of these in Ohio.    If you live near one of these restaurants and you haven't been you need to go immediately.....well they are closed right now but you need to go as soon as they open next!  Sooooo worth it."}
{"text":"I truly love this place. Such an awesome find. I make it a point to bring all out of town guests here because I think it's that good. It get's crowded on weekends, but I'm assuming that's because of how awesome it is. While I don't really stray to far from my \"north shore scramble\",what I have tasted otherwise has been great as well. Staff is friendly and parking is always pretty easy as well. I enjoy when it gets a little warmer and I can sit outside, but inside is always fine as well. Will definitely be back, again and again and again."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy this establishment.  We have never had a bad experience here.  Once I did order something and they were out and the manager compt my meal entirely.  That is good customer service.  They are always busy but you can see why when you get your food.  Definitely recommend this place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. And my last time eating here also. Coffee was terrible and my biscuit was hard as a brick. I'm from Louisiana so I understand the coffee is not going to be as good as our coffee. But the biscuit was not acceptable. But you have to give a new place a shot.  Other than that the chicken Fried Steak was great. And my husbands omelet was good."}
{"text":"I love the food here! My family eats here about twice a month, sometimes more. The food is always amazing. Unfortunately the service is really hit or miss. There are great servers there but there are a couple of ladies that really miss the mark. This morning in particular was very disappointing. There can be a wait to get seated but it's usually pretty short and the food is well worth it. Despite the sometimes lackluster service this is a favorite and I highly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place every time we go in for breakfast. Their coffee cakes are perfect to satisfy that morning sweet tooth and that coffee if strong enough to wash it down. Busy busy but worth it."}
{"text":"This was a great place, love the logo!!!! And the breakfast food was amazing!!! Glad we hit this spot for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"the food is average tasting. i think the food is ok they dont give free refills and gives a small amount of juice"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to love the cracked egg. And when I say loved I mean we used to come almost every weekend (provided neither of us worked in the morning). However neither of us have had the desire to return recently. In a nutshell, service is not up to par and the food has been mediocre at best.   First of all, I get that the servers may be tired considering they open at 6am but don't take that out on the patrons. The last couple times my boyfriend and I have been here we've felt rushed from the moment we sat down. And it's not one server in particular, it's all of them. Often we get asked if we know what we want to eat before we even order our drinks. Then 30 seconds after we get our food the check is dropped off. Can they be any more obvious that they want to go home? Doesn't make me feel welcome.   Secondly, the food has been a hit and miss lately. The skillets are always excellent. My favorite breakfast is eggs benedict and the last time I got it here it was very cold like it had been sitting out. *thumbs down* However, the coffee cake is great which is why I'm giving this place 2 stars.   Overall, I feel like the cracked egg could go back to what it used to be if changes are made and the staff are taught what QUALITY and SERVICE are. I won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast restaurant that I've ever been to! I was part of a party of 5 and once seated, it took over 45 minuets to get our food. This was only after confronting the so called waitress and asking for a eta on our food. I stopped counting others that were seated after us (to include a party of 7) and finished eating before we ever got our food. Don't waste your time or money on this POS place!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfasts. I love their seasoned potatoes and different egg scrambles. If you haven't tried their coffee cake you must go now.  The food was served fast but the rest of the service left more to be desired."}
{"text":"This place always has a line so I expected to have an amazing breakfast. Boy was I disappointed. Our server wasn't very warm or friendly. No greeting or menu tour - when she approached the table she said \"ok what can I get you\". When I told her our group needed another minute she made a face and was clearly annoyed.   I'm not sure what this place is known for. Breakfast burritos? Pancakes? I had the Greek omelette which was awful. The eggs were overlooked. The best part was the toast. Hash brown were greasy and tasted like oil."}
{"text":"Wow! Glad I found this place off the strip, was not disappointed. From the moment we walked in the staff was very nice and friendly. Service was great and our food came fast. I ordered the Monte Cristo with seasoned potatoes and it was amazing!   Some meals come with toast or coffee cake options, go with the coffee cake ;)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots. I love their scrambles but my favorite thing is the warm coffee cake. The piece is pretty big so I usually share with on of my daughters.   Service is always excellent. But it's a busy place so be prepared to wait. The portions are smaller than egg works but still a good size"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The food is good but not sure it was worth the wait after Ashely the manager was rude. So took away from the experience of coming here. The waitress we had was knowledgeable about the menu and very nice and even apologized for her mistake but didn't realize she couldn't make substitutions on the menu for simple cottage cheese.  It's too bad a place like this has a manager with poor customer service and people skills."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in Vegas, along with its sister the cracked egg on the west side. the stuffed french toast is one of the best things on the menu, but they have very good food over all."}
{"text":"About as solid diner food as you can get. Everything I've gotten here has been solid, if a bit overpriced. Nonetheless, I go there regularly."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. Wanted an order to go and they had me sit and wait to place the order for 15 minutes. They sat at least a dozen people at tables before i finally walked over and asked when they would take my order !?!?  Many of the people they sat got their food before i even ordered.   Got my order and they forgot to give me chocolate milk that i ordered and didnt realize until i got home.  Worst service ever 5/10/15"}
{"text":"Customer service is terrible at this location. We waited 20 minutes to be seated. Two customers came in a couple minutes after us and were seated before us. Needless to say we walked off and will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"I have come here for about a year and the food has always been good. Now that there is a new generation and management that has taken over , many new improvements and changes on the menu and even more exemplary service. I highly recommend this great Glendale restaurant."}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg is awesome! A small group of us came here for breakfast and were not disappointed. The food is GREAT and the portions are generous. I would recommend the Cracked Egg to anyone who lives or visits the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and friendly. No wait when we came on a sunday morning, but tables were constantly full.  We had country benny, corned beef and ordered two sandwiches togo for our trip to the parks. Everything was delicious and cooked to order."}
{"text":"Great place.  Everyone was friendly, food was great, cute decor. They must be doing something right because they were packed for Sunday breakfast and the pancake chain place just down the road had 2 cars.  Well worth Te short 10 min wait."}
{"text":"This place needs work...  I'm sorry I tried twice and I'm afraid of coming back here after the last experience. The first time i came here with my sis and the guy, the food AND service was awful. I thought I'd give it another shot and I did-- and I don't know what the hell I was thinking. I should've left when the guy and I walked in and the place only had about 8 patrons including the both of us. We were seated and the lady seemed nice. Scanned the menu and looked at the prices, and it seemed pricier than the other breakfast places. Anyway, to make things short, we were seated, drink orders were taken, lady said she'd give us a couple of minutes--uh, more like forever. She even apologized she said she thought we were still looking at the menus, but really we were looking at our phones(YELPING..). The guy ordered steak and eggs(15 bucks) and I ordered two eggs(over easy) with a side of toast. Again, we waited. Not as long as we did earlier but it seemed like a while. THEN, the food came. Oh wait did I mention they \"don't do medium rare steak orders\" here. And it all made sense. The steak was bad! I mean it stank and it was old! Not to mention the fact that it made my bf sick. I should've told him to stop eating it when I smelled it. Uggh... And then came my eggs....how do you mess up eggs??!?!? Over easy--not sunny side up. Damn it cracked egg...  I really wish we enjoyed this place as much as the others did. But really? I'm probably being  generous right now by giving them two stars.   I'm not sure if I would come back and try other things on the menu but if I did, it'll be a very long time."}
{"text":"They rock. Their food is awesome, especially also if you have a gluten intolerance. Erin is the best!! We always ask to sit in her section when we come. Speedy, friendly service and hands down the most delicious breakfast in town. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Start your day off right!!! Food is fantastic!!! Nice new store close to Red Rock casino. Breakfast is my favorite meal and never disappointed here. Staff is great, funny, fun yet professional. My all time favorite server is Rhonda, the tall blonde she's quite witty and always make me/us laugh!"}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg is a great Mom and Pop Brunch Cafe with a few locations in town. They have the BEST Biscuits and Gravy I have ever had. The Croissant French Toast is good as well as their omelets. They have decent prices and good old fashioned comfort food that keeps me coming back. However, I find it quite annoying that most of their dishes don't come with a choice of sausage or bacon and it cost an arm and a leg to order it on the side. Their bacon and sausage on the side costs more than buying it at a grocery store! Seriously, they are cheap meat so I don't see why they charge so much. I like sweet and salty meals. I just can't have one without the other. A girl needs her protein."}
{"text":"I definately would come here again, the service is great (she wanted to add me on snapchat) and the food it great. It is the perfect size and it is a great welcoming restaurant. I would prefer THE MONTE CRISTO, a ham and swiss cheese sandwich coated in french toast batter, and deep fried. 10/10 would totally recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I placed a to go order at 932am today by the time I arrived at the location at 950am our food was ready. The hostess greeted me as I walked in, told her my name, paid my ticket and drove back home. The easiest most convenient morning this week. The food was hot and very tasty. I will continue business with them."}
{"text":"We really liked this place. They have lots of options and plenty of seating, and our server was very friendly and helpful since it was our first visit. If you came here for breakfast and didn't get the coffee cake, then you only got half the experience. The coffee cake MAKES this place. It's unreal. I have to go back and make sure it actually is as good as I remember."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy going to Sunday brunch and earlier this week we decided to go to one of my favorite places, The Cracked Egg.  As always the food was delicious and the server was great (thank you Vanessa).  After finishing our meal, I paid the bill and my husband and I decided not to rush off, but to relax a couple of minutes, talk, and finish off our beverages.  It was then that the restaurant manager, \"Monica\", came over to our table and asked if there was anything else we needed.  We said no and she replied \"have a good day\".  A few minutes later Monica and one of her colleagues came and stood near our table.  Every few seconds she would look my way--I guess they wanted us to leave.  When my husband got up to go to the cash register, Monica said to her colleague, \"didn't they just go get change?\"  And in fact I had, but needed additional change to give our sever, Vanessa, a larger tip.  While my husband waited in line at the register, Monica returned to the register area and told a waiting customer, \"we are trying to get you seated together, but some people just won't leave, you know how that is\".  \"Monica\" is unprofessional and should NOT be serving in a leadership role at your restaurant.  I guess it's time for my family to find another restaurant for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Bit of mixed feelings on this place, and I will tell you why...  My Eggs Benedict was not good, at least not worth it for the price. They were tasteless and the Hollandaise was watery, not thick and creamy. Ended up throwing most of it away.  Their prices are a bit much, especially on such simple items.  Although, I ate some of my fiancee's S'mores French Toast with Nutella and it was amazing. And huge portions as well. They had some really interesting menu choices that ARE worth the price.  Case in point, can be worth it if you end up getting what you pay for."}
{"text":"Very flavorful. Waitress was very nice. Good portion sizes. Came during Saturday morning rush and only wanted about 5 minutes. Food came out to table in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"I've been to the cracked egg quite a few times because my wife really enjoys their food and coffee. I've almost always been given a military discount on my meals but just found out that because I wasn't in my uniform that I am not eligible for a discount. Unfortunately, we have been directed to not wear our uniform off base and even after telling them that, they still refused to offer me a discount. I am not greedy, nor do I expect people to always give the military a discount, I just appreciate it when they do since it makes me feel like the country we are supporting and defending are also supporting us.   I will most likely still go back to the cracked egg for their good food and coffee but just wanted to give the other military members a heads up of their discount policy.   The restaurant called EggWorks still gives military discounts when not in uniform."}
{"text":"Always,always,always a great experience! Luke and his team are always striving to deliver an exceptional product and exceptional service that is hard to find anywhere..."}
{"text":"We come to Vegas several times a year. Love going to The Cracked Egg for their gluten free pancakes. Wish I could pick this restaurant up and move them to Oregon. Love the outdoor seating too. The one on Green Valley doesnt't have that feature."}
{"text":"So impressed with the service and the food! I definitely will be back! Everything is so fresh!"}
{"text":"Found this place through yelp when I wanted a unique breakfast away from the tourists and chain restaurants. Comments were noting the high prices but I found they were generally several dollars cheaper than the IHOP breakfast I had the day before. This was the most unique and best tasting breakfast I've had in a long, long time. I walked away very full and completely satisfied. I will be visiting again on my next trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is an updated review for a previous review of 5 stars. Now don't get me wrong is till love Cracked Egg and have continued to be loyal to this great breakfast spot. I'm taking 2 stars off because of the service we get when we arrive and when we leave. If the older woman up front was more friendly upon arrival and when leaving maybe I wouldn't feel the way I do. It's such a shame! Such a great establishment and yet tainted by something as simple as greeting and saying goodbye. I understand at times it gets hectic and busy, you may lose your temper but you shouldn't make your guests feel like a burden when they ask to sit outside. You obviously have a patio and people are clearly sitting outside. Being in the industry I understand how frustrating customers can get but it's our job to give a great experience to keep them coming back. We've been coming here for over a year now and are the lowest of low maintenance when it comes to eating here. We know what we want, get in and get out. Foods great, waiters are great it's the leaving experience and coming experience that gives me a bad taste in my mouth :/ although I appreciate the nice gentleman who came by our table and apologized for not being able to accommodate our requests, even though it wasn't his fault, thank you good sir!"}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg... YES PLEASE! This place is awesome. The food is great. I am not a big fan of breakfast so I usually order of the lunch menu. The portions are huge, be prepared to take the extra home or bring a friend a split something. My hubby always orders something off the egg side just so he can get the coffee cake, it's really good. The service is wonderful and it's completely family friendly. This is not the best place to go if you are looking for a quick bite. It can sometimes take 30 plus minutes to get food when busy but worth the wait."}
{"text":"First, let me say the menu -- wow! Plenty of variety for breakfast. I ordered eggs, turkey sausage, fruit instead of potatoes.  I asked for the homemade coffee cake in a to-go box and toted it to a colleague who loves it.  Healthy options abound and you get a lot of value. But $2.75 for a small side of sliced avocado. Really? Seemed a bit nutty to me when extra veggies for omelettes are far less."}
{"text":"The Big Bad Wolf Omelette is awesome!  I think the four meats are bacon, ham, sausage and polish sausage.  Along with cheddar cheese, I had no reason to huff and puff and blow anyone's house down.  My friend had the chicken caesar salad.  Breakfast for lunch is delicious! :)"}
{"text":"Closer to a 3 1/2.  Bring your appetite....the servings are big.  Depending on your hunger level...you could get 2 orders for 3 people. The service was excellent, the place clean and the brea,kfast was very good...coffee was decent. The crumb cake thing is a little overrated but was a nice change over toast....if you have it I would skip pancakes and french toast as the sweets and carbs would be overkill.   We had pancakes, french toast, omelet and a skillet....the egg dishes shined more than the others.  Great for brunch too.  No idea how the sandwich/lunch menu is.  ENJOY."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. Not bad but I haven't had anything that has really stood out.  I get the Denver omelette. It's alright but I wish they would put more cheese on it and also put the cheese inside the omelette rather than just on top. It doesn't seem as cheesy when they put it on top and I like all the ingredients inside to be a part of the gooey cheesiness...but I guess that might just be my personal preference :) putting some more meat in there wouldn't hurt either. I feel like they really skimped on the meat.  There were times, where it felt like I was just eating a veggie scramble."}
{"text":"I have had breakfast here several times now.  I usually stick with the scrambles or omelets and have yet to be disappointed.  The eggs are always cooked perfectly and the ingredients are fresh.  I especially enjoy there seasoned potatoes.    Good breakfast atmosphere with a nice location close to the freeway.  Service was fast and they actually refilled my water glass throughout the meal!    The go-to place on the weekend for breakfast in Henderson."}
{"text":"Great service, waiters were very friendly and prompt. They were good about asking if we wanted more coffee or water. The only downside because the food is so good is there will most likely be a wait."}
{"text":"Just went to this establishment and I was asked to leave by a patron because of my hat. The manager allowed it good for them"}
{"text":"Being new to the area my wife and I were anxious to try this place. We went for lunch and both ordered off the sandwich menu. The food was prepared very quickly and looked nice but unfortunately that's really the only positive point of our experience. We both found our meals to be rather bland with the exception of our side salads and certainly not worth the $35 bill. To add to the disappointing meal was the appearance and less than friendly staff. Employees do not have be overly happy but a fake smile would have helped. When we went to pay the bill after leaving a cash tip, the man behind the cash register who was dressed in jeans and a white t-shirt with no employee identifying marks, seemed way to anxious for me to add a tip and even offered to fill in the reciept for me.  Maybe we just caught this place on a bad day but we will be in no great hurry to return."}
{"text":"So I have been coming to this Cracked Egg pretty much since it opened years ago. I say I average at least once a week or more either for lunch or breakfast.  Often hit the other locations as well depending on where my day brings me. That's a lot of pancakes.    Always been a fan, and sad to say that the poor experiences that I have had most recently actually prompted me to create a yelp account. Normally I would just voice such concerns to the manager, but sad to say I don't really think he would be receptive.  He seems more interested in socializing than he does running this place to the standards set by the other Cracked eggs.  I hope the owner reads this, because i am one of those regulars that would always tell his friends about how good all of these restaurants were.  Not going to happen again.  I speak from experience as a customer, and as an operator.   My last visit ,  four other tables seated... 10 minutes for a waitress to stop talking to her friends that she was eating with and come take my order.   Another 15 minutes  before the order came out (eggs, bacon, toast, fruit). This has become pretty much a routine occurrence.  Staff- I am not paying to watch you eat and socialize with each other, and your friends that you bring in.  And for life of Gordon Ramsey- don't sit down and eat yourself, then get up, not wash your hands, and then bring me my order when you feel like it-  WITH a mouthful of food!!!  Who does this??  Portion sizes have always been consistent as a rule with this brand. Lately, they seem to vary from huge to tiny.   Food costs must be a treat to chart here.  Flavors always varied, I guess depending on who is cooking as of late.  Cleanliness?  Brush crumb on floor- then step on throughout day.    Oh BTW, the spill on the floor that nobody cleaned up... almost caused me to kill myself. But hey, as long as  the staff have time to text on their phone and update facebook between sitting down to chat with friends...what's one more dead customer right?   No follow up on refills or up selling on staff's part anymore.  I am sure the owner is glad to know that rather than supervising, the manager generally leaves well before the staff at closing. Seen that at least a half dozen times in the last two months.  No side work, or clean up being done when slow.  Have seen tables take ten minutes to get bused, floors routinely filthy, and bathroom a horse wouldn't use.   3 Visits in the last two weeks. Each one more disappointing than the last.  Staff generally unorganized and disinterested.  A continuous flow of new employee faces over the last few months tells me their is a general leadership problem.  I remember years going by where the same cashiers, busboys , waiters and waitresses were on like clockwork. At my last visit,  I heard one waitress tell another that she wasn't told if she was working  tomorrow????  Wasn't told yet by closing???  Communication is key in hospitality.   Attention to detail no more.  The staff might not care about my $200 or so a month they will be losing in the future, but i am sure the owners might care about the 50 other customers like me who have been noticing the same race to the bottom.   Good Evening...I'm Will McAvoy"}
{"text":"I don't wait, to many other places to eat at.  GLAD I waited!   Definitely a mom and pops place.   If you like great food, fun (everybody there, servers and guests ) were having a great time....thus why it gets a little loud....if you like small town atmosphere,  this is it."}
{"text":"By far this is my favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas! They have the best food... I recommend the Joe's Scramble.  And you have to get their coffee cake!  The cake is different every time, but always very delicious!    They get very busy during lunch hours and especially breakfast times during the weekend, so plan accordingly.  They have wonderful service and some of the staff even remembers me and I'm not even a regular.  You feel at home here and I'm always stuffed after going.    Enjoy!! :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! The amount of food is perfect and super affordable, the building has been given a facelift and is clean. I enjoyed my dining experience."}
{"text":"I had the huevos rancheros and boy were they delicious.  The carnitas that they served with them were delicious, and the green sauce (probably tomatillo) that topped them and the beans was delicious as well.  They also have old school shredded hash browns!  I was so excited about this, you rarely see them anymore, usually it's now breakfast potatoes, which I'm not a big fan of.  The hash browns were great, crispy on the outside and smooth/fluffy on the inside, delicious!  The service here was good too; I was doing a working breakfast and my waitress was nice enough to only stop by a couple of times outside of taking my order and delivering my food and then clearing.  Overall, I would say if you want a solid and tasty breakfast here would be a good place to go."}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times. I've even brought my family here on several occasions.   The food was great every single time. Service is always good as well.  Only reason we stopped going was because the wait to be seated is always at least 45minutes. It's a small place and gets very busy.   Huevos rancheros were very good. Good portion  Eggs Benedict is so good.  Their potatoes and omelette are like home cooked food."}
{"text":"This was the first time and boy really good hot food even eating outside.We definitely had the best server SHARON .She is the best!!!!'"}
{"text":"YUM!!! I go to The Cracked Egg for breakfast and lunch whenever I can. I'm stuck on the Veggie Benny right now, but the Greek omelet and Chile Verde Rancheros are great too. My husband says they have great coffee and don't forget the coffee cake (just the best), which is like a light angel food goodness with either apples or chocolate chips and always freshly baked and warm. Everything is incredibly fresh at this place.   The service is friendly and they will split meals as well. They also have half orders of the salads, which are pretty large. It's a popular place, so get there early if you don't want to wait (but the wait isn't too bad). Goes to show you, good food draws a crowd."}
{"text":"Great place! Great food and great service. I loved this place. Its small yeah, but I don't mind. I really liked it. We went for lunch on a Saturday and it wasn't very busy , so we walked right in and sat down. You have a choice of sitting at a counter ( thats right a real cafe counter) or at tables. Four of us had 2 Monte Cristo sandwhiches (thanks Yelpers for the tip that they served these here - hadn't had one in many a day) ( and no , were not big eaters) They were great, service was great, definitely will come back and in fact this is my new favorite place to eat lunch."}
{"text":"Mother's Day. Thought we would be waiting forever. To my surprise they were properly staffed. 6 of us in my family and our order came out in under 10 minutes. Food was delicious. Service was fantastic. Food was hot and ready to eat. Great job.."}
{"text":"Came here for late breakfast while visiting my BFF. The food was amazing, the portions were huge and the staff was friendly! Such a cute place! I wish we had something like this in NY.. Hint, hint!"}
{"text":"I love having breakfast here and the food is really good. The Veggie Bennie is my fav, but I always do it with scrambled eggs instead of poached. The only thing that holds me back from giving 5 stars is that when sitting outside, the service is much slower. Other than that this place is great."}
{"text":"This is my first choice for breakfast!! The homemade coffee cake is out of control. The coffee cake is a different flavor every time but it is always good. The service is quick and the servers are always friendly. This restaurant is almost always busy but there is usually an available spot at the bar!"}
{"text":"They say what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas, but there was so much bland, rubbery cheese on my thin, dead omelette that I'll probably be crapping it out for weeks."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vegas I have to eat breakfast here at least once. The Cracked Egg is hands down the best breakfast I have ever had. Everything on the menu is fantastic but I always get The Bacon Cheeseburger Skillet! Sometimes there is a little bit of a wait but the food and the service is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I feel like the quality of the food is missing due to their large portions. I also think they should downscale their menu and focus on their better entrees rather than have a menu full of bland dishes. I ate my breakfast food but my friends both chose to send theirs back.  This is an ok place but I wouldn't really say it's good or great."}
{"text":"How many breakfast places still have Monte Christo's . To make it better they do it right Fried not grilled.  But they don't stop there, the meat is so tender you can cut this sandwich with a fork. As for service Tori did her job to perfection coffee was kept hot food was fresh and hot when it arrived. Have to come back though for the coffee cake."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location since 2005 and have always had great service! There are a variety of choices to pick from and the food is always good. We always try to pick Liz's section as she is nice and always remembers our order! Great breakfast and lunch place!"}
{"text":"Right next to my work. Fast and friendly service. Great tasting breakfast. Long line on weekends."}
{"text":"(10/8/17) Very disappointed. I came her with a friend that just moved here and when looking at places around us, this place showed up and had great reviews. Our waitress was nice and courteous but made more than enough mistakes for us to take notice. My favorite breakfast is biscuits and gravy but the biscuits here are just not something I'm use to. They are huge but not a good way in my opinion. The eggs were very mediocre. I literally could have easily made these scrambled eggs at home. My friend wanted some country potatoes, but they gave her what looked liked country potatoes that were put through a pasta roller. Just big strips, not strands of mashed potatoes. Is that suppose to be hash browns? I don't know. And what really did it for me was when my card was accidentally used to on another tables huge bill. They said they fixed it but the info is still pending on my card and I won't be happy until its gone. Anyways, this place is like a diner, similar to Denny's but not as clean. Not going to lie, I would have rather gone to Denny's. At least my experience with them has been consistent. I don't think I would come back again, but if I ever do and its a better experience, I will update."}
{"text":"Everytime I'm in Vegas have to eat here. Great Staff, Atmosphere and of course GREAT food. Took my daughter there for the first time and they just earned another customer. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"A gluten free diner's gem in Las Vegas! This place was SO good that we went to 2 out of their 4 locations while on vacation over the weekend. This location in particular was our second stop at a Cracked Egg location.  There was a bit of a wait at this location on a Sunday, but they still moved the line pretty quickly. This location also has a great outdoor patio dining area which unfortunately was full. We waited for no longer than 10 minutes and service was super-fast and friendly! Tip: If there is a long wait, you can sit at the counter and not wait at all. Another plus about this location: our meals came out really quickly! So quickly that even our waitress said it was quick! Given that we were famished, we definitely appreciated that.  Having been through the drill at their other location, I requested the gluten free menu and was excited to try yet another meal here. SO many gluten free breakfast options! Choose from scrambles, to omelettes, skillets and gluten-free pancakes.   At this location I tried the Lighten Up scramble which consisted of egg whites, with turkey, diced green peppers and a side of salsa. All eggs come with a side of hash browns or seasoned potatoes and gluten free toast! I was glad the server (as well as the menu) mentioned that the bread was toasted in a non-gluten-free toaster; however they will happily grill it for you to avoid contamination. The scramble was delicious - the ingredients tasted really fresh and light. I ordered the hash browns again because they are so darn good - perfectly seasoned and crispy!   My husband who does not have any dietary restrictions also loved this place, especially since they serve you a huge chunk of warm, delicious coffee cake with your eggs!   Will most definitely return here if ever in Vegas again - especially since I saw that they also have gluten free lunch options such as burgers and sandwiches."}
{"text":"A gluten free diner's gem in Las Vegas! This place was SO good that we went to 2 out of their 4 locations while on vacation over the weekend.   We stopped by this location on the first day and the service was fast and friendly and I was impressed at how familiar with gluten-free dining my server was. I also loved that they have a separate gluten free menu which you can request.  SO many gluten free breakfast options! Choose from scrambles, to omelettes, skillets and gluten-free pancakes. On my visit here I was so excited for all of these options that I ordered a bit too much food so beware, the portions are quite large.  At this location I tried the Southwest Scramble which consisted of eggs, chorizo, green peppers, pickled jalapenos, onions and a side of salsa. All eggs come with a side of hash browns or seasoned potatoes and gluten free toast!

My husband who does not have any dietary restrictions also loved this place, especially since they serve you a huge chunk of warm, delicious coffee cake with your eggs! I was jealous but was more than elated with my own meal.

{"text":"I used to consult for a Vegas telecom business, and each and every time I went I would beg my clients to go to the Cracked Egg with me.  Situated at the Flynn Gallagher plaza next to Starbucks, this little gem of a place serves up the best Eggs Benedict ever - I usually get mine with Avocado and Tomato because I'm a bleeding-heart vegetarian, and they are so divine.  I actually sit on the plane ride there and daydream the whole time (and salivate, too) about what I'm going to inhale at this charming little nook.    This client of mine hired other consultants, too, who flew in from various places as Denver and New Jersey and Texas, and we all agreed that we would somehow conspire to conjure up a reason to have a business breakfast/lunch at the Cracked Egg."}
{"text":"Well being a new resident of North Las Vegas from San Francisco, drove around and stumbled onto the Cracked Egg.  Party of 1, sat at the counter, order came right up. Not bad for a Sunday at 11:00am. I had an El Vaquero. Yum. Good portions, well prepared, everybody was nice.  I'll be back.  Only eye raising moment, noticed the 10+ child booster chairs. (loss of 1 star) Must get LOUD at times.  This day, not even a Cell Phone conversation. (Thank You very much!)  It was a couple of dollars more than I'd thought. But I'm finding that everywhere here.  Not what it was years ago. But what is?"}
{"text":"Great place! Great service! I had the Philly, my friend had an omelet with the coffee cake. Recommend the coffee cake."}
{"text":"The service and food are outstanding.  I ordered an omelet and cooked it to order with the changes that I requested."}
{"text":"Stopped here when visiting Las Vegas. After reading the reviews I was worried about the service but still wanted to go because of their gluten free menu. When we arrived the service was great. Nothing spectacular but definitely not rude like some comments imply.  We ordered a burger which I heard was great and I had a gluten free skillet without eggs (they happily substituted fruit for it). Both seasoned potatoes and toast may have cross contamination so I stuck with the hash browns and a gluten free muffin. This is where it gets AMAZING. I have never eaten such a good gluten free muffin. I was really scared that it wasn't gluten free after all. But no reaction. So I ordered an extra one for the road. Still scared while I'm eating it now. Seems too good to be true ;-)  Overall great gluten free safe breakfast joint with the best muffins. #happyceliac"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful.   The food was great and our hostess was so nice.  After a long night on the strip, a good breakfast like this really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Okay this is a great place for a quick and casual breakfast. Where I haven't tried everything I am a big fan of the Veggie Benny. The dish is served on traditional English muffins, topped with tomatoes, poached eggs and avocado, smothered in hollandaise. Yet don't forget the Potatoes, these little squares, seem to be deep fried and seasoned yet not quite to perfection, but all the same they are good. I would say that the hollandaise could be thicker. But as a whole this restaurant has a menu with a wide range of traditional breakfast and lunch favorites. This wham bam breakfast joint, is a nice place to go with family and friends in a very relaxed environment, even appropriate for a quick breakfast or lunch for any business oriented outing. This location is definitely going to give the corporate chop shops, IHOP, Denny's, and the Original Pancake House a worthy competitor in the turf war that is breakfast. Surely The Cracked Egg has more of a local, friendly, and welcoming environment than its corporate competitors as well. Please stop by this restaurant and give it a shot. It is at Green valley just off pebble in the smiths parking lot."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a long time. I always receive excellent service, happy workers, and they're all so very sweet and genuine.   Food is BOMB :)  I usually get the croissant egg sandwich thingy (can't think of the name for some reason) and occasionally a coffee cake.    Pros: Great coffee (not so common) The best customer service Excellent food Nice place  Can eat inside or out   Cons: Can't think of any. :) the wait usually isn't more than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here, and it's amazing. The staff is friendly and the service is great. The first time I had the PB stuffed French toast, without the honey because I like syrup.  It was fantastic!  Today I had the Joes scramble with sausage instead of hamburger. Again fantastic. My kids did not want to come here because they don't like eggs, but I made them:) They both had the croissant French toast and said it was the best French toast (besides mine) that they'd ever had!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly service, eggcellent menu selection and hands down the best coffee cake I've ever eaten. This was a great decision. I ordered the GVP and my girlfriend got the French toast. I'm coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! So glad I found this gem. The egg's Benedict is to die for; everything is cooked perfectly and is as fresh as can be! Quick service even when they're crazy busy and the whole staff is amazing. I love this place. Having breakfast and lunch or perhaps even brunch every Saturday & Sunday now. Tell your friends!"}
{"text":"It is very difficult to get excellent Eggs Benedict anywhere.  These were second only to my own.  The eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise was thick but smooth with no congeling.  Service was good.  Clean environment.  A little pricey but worth it. I will be returning.  Thank you for a great meal."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in LV I come here!!! They have THE best brunch food!!!!! It's clean and the customer service is great!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and I am hooked! Diana was wonderful and helpful. Asked her for a meal suggestion and she asked me questions regarding my preferences.  Boy was she on point!  It was delicious!   Has the Chili Verde Ranchero...very savory. ..should not have eaten the whole thing but couldn't help myself!"}
{"text":"I probably have dined here a dozen times. Very good food that is consistent. Excellent customer service. I highly recommend their scrambles. Especially Joes scramble."}
{"text":"I will save the details. Simply a five star locals breakfast diner/restaurant."}
{"text":"OMG! is all i have to say.  I treated my boyfriend to a get away for his bday to Vegas this past weekend and i picked this place and Im glad I did. the Cracked Egg is way better than Ihop and Denny's put together. the breakfast was like being at home without being at home."}
{"text":"I've been here three times in the last few weeks, since I live and work nearby. Whole the food has been great, the service needs improvement. One of the times I went was with a group from work, at least 8 people. Service was quick, efficient and food was great. One tome before that and one time after, I was alone as I am most of the time. Service was slow both times, I had a diet coke( don't drink coffee) which finally came halfway thru the meal. I tried to get the servers attention to no avail. The last time when the bill came, I was charged for a diet coke and coffee. I asked the server about it and it took her 5 minutes to tell me that she couldn't figure outhow to refund the $2.00. So she gave me $2 out of her pocket.    I sort of blame the iffy service level on thefact that I know servers hate waiting on one person because they know the tip won't be as much. Food is good  Service is so- so"}
{"text":"We have been there for several times since we have good experience there.  But this Saturday   we went for lunch and encountered an unprofessional and impolite host who is a young and a little fat girl wearing brown hoodie.   When my young kid and I was waited to be seated for a time ( busy time), a couple came in and waited behind us.   The host served the couple very quickly but the couple noticed us in front of them, so they told host that we should be served before them.  So we stepped froward and smiled.  What surprised us was she replied us:\"  I  saw them first.\"  Then she ignored us and took the couple to one of the few empty booth.   So we had to wait another couple of minutes to be seated.  She didn't have any explanation or apology for inconvenience.  Even we finished the meal and paid at the counter where she also were the cashier.  She was accepted our payment without any smile or 'thank you' words, like we owed her money and didn't want customers to come again.     She is the only worst server in this restaurant or we wont go many times.   Before that the host was an lady with a white hair  who is warm and friendly, we were very satisfied with the service. I have the hospitality master degree and know that the host is very important since they make customers the first impression toward the restaurant.  I hope the manager could pay attention to this young host, I really don't want just one person lower the whole service quality of the restaurant.   Hope it could be better."}
{"text":"If one of my friends was reading this post, she would immediately know my identity.  This place is my all time favorite breakfast nook.  I call it the crack house.  (Okay parents, just sensor me.  I don't write for kids.  Just have your kids read Dr. Seus' Green Eggs and Ham.)  This crack house is extremely addictive.   I don't even know where to begin.  These house potatoes are so delicious.  It's size, seasoning and crispy is just yummieee.   My favorite dish is the eggs benny.  The balance and quality of the ingredients creates such a perfect harmony.  Another favorite thing here is the coffee cake.  It's a different cake all time.  It's fresh, piping hot and intoxicating!  To bad most men aren't like that.  - Uh, did I go off topic again? -M2"}
{"text":"I could tell this restaurant was popular with locals by the crowd that was there on a weekday.  They fixed our breakfast perfectly.  I can't wait to go back to Las Vegas so I can eat there again."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place! The huevos rancheros plate is the best."}
{"text":"Took my dad to the doctor. Use the map app to find food places nearby. The cracked egg popped up, &  had good reviews, so we decided to go. We had no wait time, it was about 11:30 A.m. only one couple In of us, we were seated right away. Based on the reviews we chose the coffee cake for our choice between toast and coffee cake. It was hot and delicious & had apple inside. Coffee went well with the coffee cake. We both had eggs and ham. Overall breakfast was delicious, and the price was fair. Will definitely go, if we are in this area again at eating time. Will recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"Wow...is all I can say. Their Gluten Free Blueberry Pancakes are out of this world delicious. I can't wait to drive back to Vegas just to eat these pancakes!"}

{"text":"Come here for breakfast all the time. Great service. The breakfast food is amazing. Denver omelette is great. I would strongly recommend Their French fries and hash browns as sides!"}
{"text":"You had me at stuffed french toast! Being a french toast connoisseur it takes a lot to impress me and the Cracked Egg certainly did that.    I went one morning after 9 am with a friend for a late breakfast and we both wanted something special. That is why we choose to try their stuffed french toast. We looked at all sorts of breakfast places before deciding to come here. All thanks to the menu having something different, stuffed french toast.  My friend ordered the Peanut Butter Stuffed French Toast while I had the Raspberry Stuffed French Toast. With these, you better have an appetite. Each come with six slices of stuffed french toast with a side of butter and syrup(which is overkill, the stuffed french toast prepared as is enough). The Peanut Butter Stuffed French Toast comes with bananas and, of course peanut butter, although chocolate would also be nice. The Raspberry Stuffed French Toast has a raspberry cream cheese filling with some berries and powder sugar sprinkled on top. If you want anything else, you have to order is as a side but the Stuffed French Toast will have you stuffed all by itself.   The place was busy and we had to wait about 20 minutes. Our waiter seemed to caught up in what he was doing and wasn't really engaging any of the diners. He wasn't terrible but he just seemed to be doing his job instead of giving good service. Because of that, I feel I can't give them a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. The staff was very friendly and nice. They made me feel comfortable."}
{"text":"Gluten-free menu a huge+! Great GF Blueberry pancakes! We are moving here and will be back for breakfast. Very good service to."}
{"text":"This location is a bit smaller than the 215/Rainbow one we used to go to, but didn't have to wait very long (no more than 15-20) minutes walking in on Sunday a.m. around 9:30.  Service is timely and friendly, the food is typical breakfast food and it came out in a timely manner.  The coffee cake smells wonderful, but more like a fluffy cake than a danish type of coffee cake. It is delicate and crumbles easy. $40 for 3 of us....would do without the coffee cake next time."}
{"text":"I tried this place because it had good reviews on Yelp. Big disappointment! As soon as I walked in, I thought to myself, \"what the hell?\" The decor in this place is non-existent. Both my lunch order, as well as my girlfriend's was just as appealing as the decor in the place. Would definitely not come back here!"}
{"text":"This place doesnt dissapoint, service is always good, and food is delicious. This is our go to breakfast spot in vegas!"}
{"text":"This place was sheer perfection. We were hopping from Las Vegas to Tahoe and wanted a quick breakfast bite off the 95. What a find! Their gluten free options were plentiful- clearly they have taken a thoughtful approach here. My partner had a meaty green chile eggs situation - and was in heaven. Their service was all round great and our waiter was especially sweet. We wound up ordering gluten free sandwiches for our long road trip ahead too. Thank you cracked egg- we will crack a smile when we remember you!"}
{"text":"I like the chicken fried steak they serve at this restaurant.  Made from a real tenderized round steak. But the $2.50 cup of coffee was burned. I know coffee. Their coffee was definitely burned, having been left heating at the beverage station they retrieved the carafe. I mentioned this to the waitress who insisted I was crazy. Apparently they are famous for their coffee. She came back with a new mug and the same carafe from the same beverage station as before. The second cup was just as burned as the first. For the price it should been fresh and rich without a stale burned bitter taste. I asked the waitress to taste the coffee if she didn't believe me. She refused. Instead, she brought my bill and loudly commented to everyone in earshot that I didn't have any taste buds. I asked the cashier to take off the price of the coffee I did not drink. She complied. When asked if I wanted to leave a tip I said, \"I would have if my waitress had not chided me for not being able to tell when coffee was bad.\" I didn't leave a tip. There are other places for a good chicken fried steak and much better coffee. Sorry."}
{"text":"Service and food were just alright. Prefer the Original Pancake house for taste. Price is about the same."}
{"text":"The staff were nice.  Food: I ordered the farmers skillet it was okay. Not much flavor  My husband ordered their french toast and he really enjoyed his.  The biscuit that came with my skillet was okay it was huge   Penny was our waitress she was so nice.   I did appreciate her answering our questions.    Also we notice that one waitress was handing cash, cups and then getting the toast with bare hands (not washing) and applying butter to them.  We were so thankful when we saw Penny handling the bread with tongs   *high five Penny*   The place wasn't too busy. Again service (Penny) was good.  Bathrooms were cleaned."}
{"text":"Always Very Very good. The Big Bad Wolf or Kicking potatoes are my personal Fav. I can't go 5 stars because they changed thier coffe cake recently (for the worse). It's always a good sign when a places hours are from 7-3, to me it's a sign of a good breakfast place!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell lazy   sat and waited forever while sets of tow were seated in the exact same seating we were in.  Lazy omelet with too.much cheese on top avocado on top and two lame strip of bacon in middle. Cantaloupe served whole and barely cut. Good waiter is about all that was okay"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots! Busy one weekend but wait goes by fast. Stuffed raspberry French toast is my favorite. Customer service is great too."}
{"text":"I came in half an hour before they closed. The first thing the hostess says to me is they close in 30 rather than greeting us. Within two minutes of sitting down the waitress in the next section over is talking horribly about the table across from us with one of the managers. Hopefully they reevaluate their customer service skills and take their personal opinions in the kitchen next time instead of in front of their guests"}
{"text":"The staff is super awesome!  This is a family friendly place with good food.  The portion sizes are generous.  They also have a gluten-free menu, not items but a whole menu!!!! The gluten free pancakes are really good!"}
{"text":"The best biscuits and gravy in the Valley, very friendly servers and has the back east diner feel."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place. Dineresqu feeling and I have been looking for a good breakfast sandwich in the area that can compete with my New England breakfast sandwiches. The breakfast sandwich on a croissant was delicious and just what I was looking for. They also give huge portions which is always great! A little pricey but I'll deal with it."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food.  When you can, order that cordon bleu pan.  Tried it and it was amazing.  I am never unhappy walking away from her :)"}
{"text":"On Father's Day and waiting 45 minutes for our food after waiting 30 minutes to be seated - the food was bad.  They put no meat or cream cheese in the scramble.  Asked them to remake it - they went and took another one from a waiting order that had same problem.  You are supposed to let the kitchen know what the problem was so they can correct it - not just steal some one else's meal."}
{"text":"Very mediocre and overpriced. The breakfast potatoes are Sysco. That pretty much says it all."}
{"text":"I'm an omelet girl so the first few times I came here, that's what I ordered. Not my favorite. If you're looking for an amazing omelet go to omelet house. However, I love the cracked egg because they have a gluten free menu. It's so nice to be able to order toast or pancakes If wanted.  My favorites are the skillets and scrambles. The gluten free banana pancakes are on point! The service here is always short, sweet and attentive.  I think they do an amazing job with their hashbrowns. The seasoned potatoes aren't my style but my daughter and fiancé love them. Eggs over easy are always perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"came here for breakfast.  they were OKAY. the menu was super exciting to look at but the overall experience was mediocre.   my bf and i ordered (we ate half and then swapped) :  \"the Californian\" (half a avocado and two full slices of bacon in the omelet and some jack cheese on top)    -it tasted good, but it wasn't anything special, probably could have made it at home for less than i paid for.  \"the GVP\" ( lil mushroom, lil spinach, half avocado and muenster cheese topped with sour cream)   - wished there was more filling to it, it was mostly egg. tasted almost the same as the other omelet.   it comes with toast or coffee cake and hash browns or potatoes.   when i first saw the plate i was surprised at the portion size! ... but then  remember how much it cost.   $10.    i left that restaurant filling unsatisfied.  by all means the quality is much better than denny's or ihop, only if you want to shell out the extra bucks to pay for it.   if you're on a budget, i would suggest making you're own breakfast at home, unless you're a horrible cook, its going to taste around the same.  i would go back one day just to try out some of their lunch items out of curiosity but i'll pass on breakfast."}
{"text":"We love to take our daughter here for breakfast or an early lunch.  They have good pancakes, waffles, club sandwiches, turkey melts, pastrami sandwiches, and just about everything else!  There might be a little bit of a wait, but it's always worth it :)"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to order lunch from for pick up.  We will go out of our way to get their sandwiches and salads.  The food is consistently tasty and the employees are always very nice.  We haven't tried anything on the menu yet that we didn't like!"}
{"text":"I came here when this place was fast Eddies and it was good. The cracked egg is probably a little better based on my experience today. I came in on a Monday at 10am to avoid crowds and I'm glad I did. I was warmly greeted the second I walked in the door, taken to a table, served immediately and had fresh piping hot food in front of me within 5 minutes! Don't know if fast Eddie could keep up with that! Service was great. Refills on coffee, checking back and the food was great. I had the meat lovers plate with toast and added a biscuit and gravy. The eggs were cooked perfect, the gravy wasn't too thick or thin and the biscuit was nice and fresh. Good coffee and boy did I leave full. Will definitely be back to try the 4 or 5 different Benedict plates on tree menu."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. The food is always great. I have never had bad service. The menu is perfect for a breakfast place. The coffee cake is a must."}
{"text":"Good breakfast, good food, good price.  Great menu selection. Staff prompt & courteous. We ordered classic breakfasts but I was curious about their chorizo so I asked to taste a little...the waitress explained to the cooks & they sent out a small \"chorizo patty\"  and we were pleasantly surprised. Not fatty or too spicy...good flavor. Hash browns are freshly cut. Next time will order the Mexican Benedict. Heard the owner say she's trying to offer different menu selections. There are options for the weight/health conscious too. Will definitely be a regular! Place is clean, newly remodeled, which is a big plus!"}
{"text":"Heard about The Cracked Egg from an previous Las Vegas resident.   Our waitress, Emily, was wonderful! I asked for recommendations and she gave me a wonderful selection. I ended up choosing \"Joe's Scramble\" and substituting bacon instead of the ground beef. It was FANTASTIC! The scramble was a \"egg\"celent, cheesy, bacony and spinach monster! So delicious!  He choose the \"Biscuits and Gravy\" and he couldn't stop raving. The biscuits were soft and the gravy was tasty. He was able to substitute bacon instead of the hash browns and the bacon was cooked to perfection!   Two meals and full bellies for under $30!!! I wish there were more places like this!  Our only con was the booth. The cushion was lacking so don't plop down in them like we did and hurt yourself."}
{"text":"Amazing food, the French fries are the best I've ever had, great prices ! I will return. Service was great, was seated in about 10mins on a busy Sunday after noon.! Thank you!  No wifi. Which is actually a plus, I actually got to have a nice convo with family ."}
{"text":"Great place for a late breakfast! Nice to see a mixed type of clientele. Love the corned beef hash! Its hard to find a place that uses the canned kind. I'll keep coming back just for that! Sometimes the service is slow but its a fine time to catch up on life. So sit back, enjoy your meal, look out of the window.  And....you sometimes get free ice-cream!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was issued a comp once I emailed the company about our first visit, we went back today. I am happy to report this visit was a lot better the manager was friendly when we walked in and the staff was very nice, the food was also very good. Thank you for a positive experience with myself my friend and out two toddlers."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Cracked Egg for about 3 years (both Green Valley & Rainbow locations). I frequent the Green Valley location since that is the closest to where I live. Can I just say, I've never been disappointed with a meal there. For the most part, breakfast is what I love to order there. The Croissant breakfast sandwich is one of my favorites and so is the Garden Patch omelet.  The staff is always friendly and the wait for seating usually goes by very fast. They are very busy Saturday & Sunday mornings but they tend to get through the crowds fast.  If you join their Rewards program, they send you an $8 coupon every month. Plus, when you earn points on your card, they send you $10 gift certificates! Because of these, my husband and I probably go there at least twice a month"}
{"text":"Quick service and great food. they have a different coffee cake every time I have been and it's warm and delicious.  You can get it instead of toast. The corned beef hash skillet with chorizo is my favorite.  My companion loves the cheeseburger skillet"}
{"text":"I have been to several of the cracked egg locations and have never had anything but a great experience. I personally prefer to go to local family owned establishments like this one. I love to get the peanut butter stuffed french toast. I also like to get the build your own skillet because the variety of options they have. I noticed somebody wrote a tip about it but it is worth repeating that their coffee cake is excellent. I might be addicted to it as I can't prevent myself from ordering it whenever I come to the cracked egg. My favorite one to get when it is available is the peanut butter one but they all are good. Over the years I have tried the majority of options they have had on their menu and was always satisfied. This new location is no different. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast food!  Have been to this location several times and every time I am happy with the food and the service. Was there with a party of 5 for breakfast.  Normally I order the Greek omelet, but this time I got the Tropical French toast.  It was yummy!  Others  ordered French toast, multigrain pancakes, and a skillet.  Everyone was happy with their meal.  The service was not the best but the place was crowded on a Thursday morning at 9 AM so that is understandable."}
{"text":"Amazing Down home cooking!! Great coffee and friendly service-def a new hangout spot"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee cake. Always order eggs and hash browns. Food cooked to perfection. Orange juice is freshly squeezed. Ambiance is relaxing with a neighborhood feel. Always packed on the weekends so arrive early for breakfast."}
{"text":"The menu had so many items that looked good that it was tough to choose. Really good food."}
{"text":"My new breakfast spot!!!  The veggie breakfast skillet is my favorite. Lots of veggies and seasoned potatoes. I asked them to go easy on the cheese and they did it perfectly.  My hubby tried the sweet potato/apple skillet and really enjoyed it. It's always fun to try something different.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered a California omelette. The avocado was rock hard and brown on the inside from the pit. The peach coffee cake had a minuscule amount of actual peach in it. The coffee is good and service is friendly though."}
{"text":"I finally found a great place to eat breakfast. The skillet breakfast is my favorite. I'm definitely eating here more often"}
{"text":"ok let me be clear.... this place is absolutely amazing. Coffee cake is to die for. Tropical french toast and thats with macadamian nuts and toasted coconut is f****** good. Seasoned potatoes are way better than a long shot vs. Egg works, perfectly seasoned and not salty as f***. anyways yeah i feel like John Smith discovering the New World. this place rocks. And our server Cory is amazing!!"}
{"text":"The BEST blueberry pancakes!!!! Tons of blueberries in them and they are huge!!! They aren't of the uber-buttery variety that can leave you feeling like you just ate a brick of food. My husband has tried the pumpkin panckes in the fall which are amazing and the banana nut ones are equally yummy.  You HAVE to get the coffee cake, it's the best thing you'll ever eat. May be line on weekends after 9 but it goes quick. We go every weekend, we've tried other places but this remains the best. T he pancakes are light and fluffy , not like the butter overloaded ones at blueberry hill, etc. The owner Curtis is an awesome guy, he's bought our breakfast numerous times since were there 1-2 times a week. They take care of their regulars. Laura is the best waitress ever!!!  They bust there butst there. My dad devoured the tropical French toast and my husband gets the garden patch omelettte. You won't go wrong with this place , we have yet to find anything better!!!!"}
{"text":"Seasoned potatoes here are amazing!! Also there are a ton of different omelette variations that make each time I come here something new and not just the same old breakfast food over and over again.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. You would think they'd have a better system set up by now since it's always packed on the weekends. But they can't seem to figure it out. Why do we keep going back? The breakfast food is good. If you go early or on a weekday, you won't have any issues. But if you go after 8:30 on a weekend, expect to wait a long time (outside) to be seated, once you're seated it will take a while before anyone takes your order, your food will take a while (get the coffee cake, it's made daily, and will make the long wait time to get your food feel shorter), and you probably won't see the waiter again once you get your food (we usually order our food when they take our drink orders, otherwise you wait a lot). Paying the bill is done at the same counter as the check-in so it gets crowded. The Cracked Egg on Cheyenne has the same food and MUCH BETTER service. We just go to this one because we live walking distance away."}
{"text":"Get there early to avoid the wait on the weekend.  Good place to get away from the buzz on the strip.  Corned beef hash fans will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I do love eggs, and this place makes egg-ceptional eggs.  They are egg-celent actually, and you can do many things while eating eggs.  You can read an egg-sistentilent novel, study for an egg-xam, or fight Dr. Eggman in Sonic the Hedgehog, or just eat breakfast with me while I make bad puns all morning.  The place is rather big and clean, so while lots of people come here there is often either little or no wait for a table or counter seat.  Wait staff was nice and attentive, almost taking my order right away when they saw I wasn't looking at my menu anymore.  Ordered coffee and a Southwest skillet.  Coffee wasn't really the best I have had, but the food was simply excellent.  That southwest skillet was absolutely delicious, and I highly recommend it to anyone craving a mexican style breakfast.  Salsa was a bit too mild though, but then again I have a perchance for liking to punish my digestive system with spicy food, so don't mind me :).    I would definitely come back here.  It is a little pricer than eating at ihop or denny's, but it's absolutely worth it.  PROS: Delicious, well-made eggs Large and clean Good wait staff.  CONS: Coffee isn't that great  THE VERDICT:  Will keep coming here."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices but a little higher than chain restaurants you see across the country.  The coffee cake is sinful and tasty.  Breakfast & lunch menu but only until 2p, by the time I think to come here, they are already closed.  Too bad."}
{"text":"I thought it was a decent breakfast. We had a 2-1 coupon from the R-J. Coffee was good. I think the atmosphere was pretty bland. It was kind of dark inside, with no TV monitors.   Don't think I'd return unless I had a coupon. 3 stars."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here several times.  The service is always friendly and the food is great.  Sometimes there is a wait on the weekends but it never is long.  They have lots of menu choices and it always comes out hot and fast.  I always ask for iced coffee but they don't normally serve it.  A regular waiter there always makes it for me special.  All of the servers are nice.  I love that they have a loyalty program and give out their own card.  We get lots of coupons to return and get decent amounts off of our bill.  Go here and have a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Great service! Everyone here gives great service.  Most of the food here is very good.  I recommend everyone to try it out at least 1 time and  I promise you will not be disappointed.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Friendly staff Great food Yummy variety of food Homey Reasonably Priced"}
{"text":"So good! Great traditional breakfast. Their skillets are always good. The country Benny is awesome too. You have to get their coffee cake. No matter the flavor it's always delicious."}
{"text":"I went here during lunch on a Saturday. I ordered the North Shore Scramble and my friend ordered the Eggs Benedict. I was impressed with both. The North Shore Scramble has bacon, chicken and a topping of swiss cheese. Half an avocado caps it all off. Also, make sure to try the coffee cake. It is very good."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place! The kids chocolate chip pancakes were a big hit. And the Big Bad Wolf omelette was super tasty."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! We were there at noon, service was slow and it wasn't crowded at all. The place is a bit grimy, could really use a cleaning. Even the Menus felt really sticky."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Babystacks because of the similar presentation of food and portions! Cracked Egg's menu, though, is a bit bigger (not inferior though!) It's a breakfast/lunch place open from 6am-2pm Monday-Friday and 6am-3pm Saturday and Sunday.  We came here on Saturday around lunchtime. It felt a bit weird when we saw a $5 bill at our table when we got seated. Of course, we assumed that it was for the waiter and that it had been from a previous visitor. When our waiter came, he surreptitiously slipped it in his pocket. Haha no worries. Our drink runner was nice, but I got the feeling she was a bit inexperienced (e.g. spilling drinks, telling us she need to clear our table in order for use to be seated). Not a big deal though.  The menu came with plenty of add-on options and pretty exhaustive menu full of breakfast/lunch choices like skillets, make-your-own skillets, burgers, sandwiches, and even just the simple stuff like eggs and omelets. Definitely fun to check out.  I got the Huevos Rancheros and my boyfriend got the Mexican skillet. The eggs were intertwined with the flurry of cheese, jalapenos, beans, salsa, and giant dollop of sour cream on top. It comes with your choice of hash browns or seasoned potatoes. I got the seasoned potatoes which came in its own dish of small cubed potatoes poised perfectly in spices and fried. A bit crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside. The dish was definitely LDL-cholesterol-inducing. But whatever, I'm here to eat and cure post-First Friday regrettable drinking habits.  At first I thought their portions were small, but that was just the presentation. Our skillets came in sleek oblong casserole bowls served on white plates so it kind of fooled me for a second there. By the end of the meal I was dying to finish the last bite. I felt it was perfectly portioned and tasty too! It had this \"home-cooked\" feeling to it and completely savory, mouth-wateringly good. Surprisingly, my Huevos Rancheros wasn't doused in grease like I was expecting it to be, (haha like that's still any better for you at all) so I wasn't chomping down on anything oily. And my plate WASN'T dripping with fatty oil on the bottom like at Denny's. Adds to the quality of the food for sure. It's the little things you have to think about that sets the joint apart.  This place is a step-up in quality and taste from your usual Denny's and IHOPs for your usual prices ($5-$14ish). Of course at your local Denny's there's that sexy super value menu for that quick bite, but hey, this is yelp and you want a quality breakfast/lunch locale off the beaten path right? It's worth a venture that's a great restaurant--clean and courteous. Service was attentive for me! Make sure to sign up for their loyalty card service if you plan on frequenting! There's some perks involved and why not? I know I'm definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Great restaurant   We called. Ahead to see what the wait time was an it was only 15 minutes for Mother's Day morning    The start you off with a bunn cake /Danish they were quick to take your order and it didn't take long to arrive. Victoria our server did a great job and help make recommendations."}
{"text":"Not many restaurants offer their own brand of coffee.. Huge  portion of blueberry pancakes.. My wife wad very happy with her poached eggs."}
{"text":"Visited on 5/6 @ 11:15 am.  We have never had a problem at any of the locations.  Our server Diana was the WORST.  Took our order and we got our food and never saw her again until she decided to bring us the check.  This was after we asked the bus boy to find our server.  We will stick with the Cheyenne location.  Seems like they have better management.  Please give Diana our \"thanks\" just in case she didn't see it in her $3 tip.  Which was generous in our opinion."}
{"text":"Went during mothers day and the wait time was not long at all, everyone was very accommodating and polite. Service was fast and efficient, and we enjoyed the food. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I have never had anything but a wonderful experience here.  I ask for David when I can.  He's funny and quick and never misses a beat.  I've never had an order wrong.  The food is always delicious!  Don't order the same thing everytime.   They have so many delicious menu items.  Try them all!"}
{"text":"Best place for some good ol' breakfast.  We made our way here on Saturday morning with the craving of their melt in your mouth crumb cake.  We were seated pretty quickly...the place was full.  I decided to be different and order the corn beef hash.  Usually I go for the boring eggs and potatoes but I was going all out that day.  The portion was massive.  Alot of onions...like more than the corn beef but I just ate around them.  It came with eggs (egg beaters) potatoes on the side and wheat toast.  Whew it was alot and by alot I mean ALOT!  When I was done she asked if I liked it because it didnt look like I ate anything. haha  It was pretty darn good though.   I probably would get it again.    The BF ordered the kickin potatoes and the crumb cake.  Kickin potatoes are always solid...a combo of potatoes, bacon, cheese, salsa and sour cream (I think thats whats in it)   He loves them.  Now the crumb cake....amazing as usual.  Sometimes they come in different flavors but this time it was just plain cinnamon-just the way I like.  It was so hot when it came out that it was steaming.  the cake just fell apart as you tried to cut through it.  Just the little things.  Cracked Egg is always a solid local find.  There arent too many breakfast places that are not chain restaurants that I can say live up to the breakfast standards but this one surely does!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience !! Good food, great customer service and football playing. I love it . I ate the blueberry pancakes with fresh hot blueberry compot. Dustin got biscuits and gravy he said they tasted so good .."}
{"text":"We eat breakfast here every weekend. The food is very, very good. The scrambles, omelets and chicken fried steak are excellent, and the coffee is good. Sometimes the hash browns  are a little underdone, and they have a heavy hand with the cheese, but that's the exception, not the rule. The coffee cake is okay, it's more like a vanilla cake than a sweet bread creation. It's only my preference, however.   What really shines is the service. Juan is probably the best waitperson ever, he makes sure your coffee is always topped off, checks back frequently, and if something isn't right, he has no problem fixing it. Never grumpy or distracted, and even when he's super busy he still takes care of you.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It was very good.. Despite the fact that we waited a looooooong time for our food to come out.. And got the it's the kitchens fault routine.. We all work in the service industry.. So we didn't by that.. Would've been nice if something was comped considering how long we waited for our food..instead of a bunch of \"I'm sorry\" from everyone that walked by."}
{"text":"Meh. I would like faster, friendlier service, better tasting food made with better ingredients. Raspberry stuffed french toast was yucky except for the real raspberries on it. When ordering coffee, be sure to check the creamer. We put in the default creamer on the table and it was sickeningly sweet French Vanilla. Asked for new coffee and plain cream. What we got was a non dairy product sweetened with corn syrup. Yuck. Finally...we asked for whole milk. Also, who opens sugar packets and puts them back into the dispenser?! No appropriate seating for our family of five. They sat us at a table for four. The place was clean and quiet toward close of day on Sunday."}
{"text":"Didn't know where to go off the 215 and saw this place. Even tho it's 1.6 miles off the freeway. It's easy to get there. Excellent food and friendly people. I recommend it. We had breakfast."}
{"text":"Food is terrific, service is terrific the food portions are large you won't leave hungry. The servers are attentive and very pleasant. The place is clean and so are the bathrooms. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing. We recently tried out the Charleston Blvd location on a Sunday it was crowded but it was only 15 mins wait for a table.   The food was amazing! And big portions! Don't forget the coffee cake oh my that is to die for.  I had the chicken fried steak and my bf some sort of omelette.   Will def come back again. Only complain was I ordered a tea and pot where they put extra hot water had a paper in it idk how it get there or why our waiter didn't see it when she filled it out with water. Either way I didn't get charge for it. Only complaint I have otherwise this place would have been 5 star."}
{"text":"Great lunch place. Very spacious with lots of booths. Located near a Starbucks. This place delivers quality food. The hamburgers are delicious and cooked perfectly. Flavorful moist tender meat. in between a hot soft bun. I also had the eggs Benedict. Nice presentation. The Hollandaise sauce was alright. It seems generic to me. It taste like it came  from  a jar. The fries and hash browns are a definite 5 star. Service was blazing fast and super friendly. I like this place :-)"}
{"text":"Always a hearty meal here for breakfast. Great service and great coffee. Feels very home. Kinda of noisy today with all the chatting, uncontrolled  kids an d the person next to me having a meeting. First time trying the homemade  hash breakfast recommended  by my server Edwin. Not to my liking I reorder  an omelet."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Service is horrible. 3x here and waitress and overall service makes me not want to come back.  The fact that they are busy should not affect  ... HOSPITALITY !!!"}
{"text":"Continuing our search for the perfect breakfast restaurant, this was the second Cracked Egg we sampled.  The food was very good, not spectacular but very good.  I had the Big Bad Wolf omelet, and it was properly named.  Packed with heart-stopping meats surrounded by the omelet it was really fit for a wolf.  The hash-browns were good too, but I had to let most of them go just to get the omelet stuffed in.  Being gluten intolerant I didn't eat the coffee cake, which my wife said was good as well,  And my cake gave her a second one to take home for later.  She also had the chicken fried steak which she really enjoyed.  The negatives and reason this is not five stars is that there was a fair wait to be seated.  Luckily it was a nice day and we could sit outside on the food-court seating.  Inside waiting is minimal. I admit we are slow starters, and came at the peak hour, so maybe if you are an early riser there might not be so much of a wait.  Also, being full and the seating closely set it was rather noisy inside.  I am not the first to post the \"no WiFi photo\" but I have posted it again to bring it to the front because their admonition to talk like it's 1995 was being followed with gusto.    Still, once seated the service was quick and the staff was very friendly and most helpful.  And that often makes up for any bumps in the road.    And fie on me, I am so used to eating around my gluten intolerance that I didn't ask if they had a gluten free menu, which I discovered after I had eaten my fill.  On the other hand, I did mention it and the gluten free menu wasn't offered.  Next time I will ask."}
{"text":"First official brunch after relocating to Vegas from NY. Had the cheeseburger skillet. The dish was well prepared and seasoned. Asked for eggs to be over medium but came in over easy, however there'hing wrong with runny eggs over your bacon cheeseburger goodness. The included coffee cake with its sweet notes and creamy center was an excellent compliment to the dishes savory notes.   Menu pricing is fair. Service is stellar.    Store opens at 6am..perfect.   I would see myself frequenting this place."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast with my volleyball team at 6 in the morning and our food came at 7. The wait was horrific but the food is great. Great enough to wait an hour? Undeclared."}
{"text":"I generally like to give small businesses the benefit of the doubt, and tend to write reviews based only on positive experiences, as once can see from my reviews. However, there was one particular aspect of having breakfast here that has induced me to write a very negative review. The food (and the quality of the food for the value) was pretty mediocre, which would normally earn about a 3 star review from me. But my experience with a staff member working the cash register has earned this location something else. After finishing my breakfast, never having dined here before, I was unsure if I was supposed to pay the check to my waitress at the table, or I was expected to carry the check up to the cash register myself to pay. After waiting at the table for 5-10 minutes, I reckoned I should walk the check up to the front counter to pay. Upon reaching the cash register, I asked a young woman in her twenties behind the counter  - \"should I pay here?\" - to which she promptly replied while motioning back toward the rear of the restaurant - \"No, you should pay it back there - in the bathroom.\" Okay, a young aspiring comedienne, not smiling at all, deadpan delivery, got it. I shrugged the comment off, smiled, and proceeded to pay the check. Upon completing the transaction, she once again went for the jugular - \"Next time you come here, pay the check in the bathroom, see how far that gets you.\" Okay, that was a little bit TOO rude, inappropriate, and no longer funny by anyone's standards. While I was driving away, I was a little bit stunned that someone would be so pointedly mean-spirited not once, but twice. I contemplated driving back there and berating this young woman, but decided against it, vowing only never to frequent the restaurant again. Management should absolutely dismiss her. One or two of her fellow women coworkers were within earshot of this whole episode, and likely recall it, should management wish to take action."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and not once did I leave unsatisfied. They have a nice variety for only being open for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Great food. Must get the coffee cake. Great service. A bit pricey, but they offer a reward card where you can earn points to get a coupon. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had breakfast there with family members. The omelettes were OK but not outstanding. The food was good in general, as in tasty enough, but it just was run-of-the-mill. We expected better from a breakfast place.   The server was almost useless and probably colors our opinion of the food. She was more interested in saying \"no\" than in saying \"I will be glad to do that for you\". She says management prohibits substitutions. I never heard of a breakfast place not allowing a swap of toast ofr pancakes. I could care less if i pay a little more, they just do not allow it without buying two complete breakfasts.   I would have given this place four stars but gave two for the poor service and very slow coffee refills."}
{"text":"I had to meet someone at this Cracked Egg location a few weeks back. I had already formed an opinion of the chain based on another Cracked Egg that I visited. HOWEVER, I was blown away at the entire experience.   The servers are funny, personable and engaging, the food is great and the decor was perfect. I had such a positive experience that i went back several times on my own since the first visit and even had a meeting there.   After having been there several times now, I can say that I have had the same great experience every time. The management must have a great system in place to train the servers and cooks to provide a consistent high level of customer experience.   I just cannot say too many good things about this Cracked Egg."}
{"text":"The Monte Cristo sandwich is so good, words cannot descirbe it. Enough said.... Get it and you will not regret it."}
{"text":"They had my name in a menu selection, how can I not be a fan! :)   This place is really neat. I have never been to a Cracked Egg before in Vegas, and I am happy to have popped that cherry at this location. I would love to go back and try some other things I was eyeing. I just could not make a decision, but I settled for an omlette and it was good!   It felt like a country vineyard type place. It was just very charming. Our service was not bad, just rushed it seemed like. Maybe they need to hire a couple more people in the morning rush of the weekend!   I would like to try more stuff, so I shall be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing. First time here. Service: perfect, couldn't have asked for a better waitress  Food: incredible EGGS BENEDICT! Cooked to perfection and just the perfect amount of sauce! I added avocado and was the perfect combo. HASH BROWNs great..not the best I've had. Definitely getting the Benedict again!  I think this place needs to be on the dinErs , drive-ins an dives show!!! Def coming back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were referred to the Cracked Egg and we will forever be life long customers. The food and the service was excellent.   So next time you're in Las Vegas stop by the Cracked Egg on Rainbow, ask for Liz tell her Jeannette & cornel sent you and order the coffee cake. I promise you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Went in late on a Sunday, there was no wait, which was great. Decided to get the Cakes and Eggs, subbed out bacon or sausage for fruit. This was a very middling breakfast. Indistinguishable from anywhere else. Probably should've got the French Toast. Whatever. It's fine. My girlfriend got the Lighten Up scramble and that was trash. The turkey in it was like lunch meat - Hillshire Farms style - which is also whatever, except it was such poor quality lunch meat. It was gross. We also weren't aware that the toast would come soaked in butter. She ate the potatoes and a little bit of toast and that was it, turkey ruined the scramble. It wasn't that bad overall, just very middling. Which, coupled with the other reviews, left a lot to be desired. In short, underwhelming. Might go back, might not. Staff was nice, no complaints about them."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy going here, but unfortunately, its service has gone considerably downhill, and I really wouldn't recommend it these days.  On my last visit, I called ahead for pickup, and I was told it would be 10 minutes.  When I arrived 10 minutes later, I paid and was told it would be right out.  For about the next 10 minutes, I watched what appeared to be my meal sitting out while other meals were shuffled around it.  When it finally arrived at the host's station, I expected to be handed my meal, but instead, the woman working there set it on top of a stack of chairs and went back to sitting around looking miserable.  I've had the displeasure of dealing with this woman the past few times I've been there, and she always seems over everything.  After a few minutes went by, I asked her if that was my meal sitting there, and she rolled her eyes and said, \"Your meal had a diet Pepsi.  I don't see a drink sitting here.\"  I assumed someone else might have ordered the same thing, so I went back to quietly waiting.  After 30 minutes of waiting, I asked the man at the station if he could tell me if that was my meal.  He said it wasn't, so I resumed waiting.  After 45 minutes of waiting, he said it was my meal and handed me the bag and turned away.  When I asked him to have it remade, he seemed surprised, and I had to explain that I didn't want to eat a meal that had been sitting out for the better part of an hour.  To his credit, he did go immediately to the kitchen and have them expedite it.  Nearly an hour of waiting later, I had a meal in-hand.  Unfortunately, the meal I received wasn't even what I had ordered.  I ordered a very simple breakfast: two eggs, over medium, potatoes, and sourdough toast.  They keep a great deal of toast on-hand when they get busy, and the potatoes were also already made, which I know because I had ample time to watch the process.  All anyone had to do was fry up two eggs, and yet I got wheat toast and barely cooked eggs; I would hesitate to even call them over easy since the whites weren't done.  I would have said something further, but at this stage, I had waited an hour for a simple breakfast and really just wanted to get out of there.  There are a number of better places in the area these days, and given the prices, I don't see how you can justify waiting an hour or more for mediocre food that doesn't even match what's ordered.  I paid nearly $14 for my meal, and I would have had a much better experience going across the street to Trader Joe's and cooking it myself.  Do yourself a favor and either only go at odd hours or don't go at all."}
{"text":"I like this place because it serves ultimate comfort food.  But it's not unique.  So this is Vegas - you get drunk and wake up late the next morning looking for hangover food.  Bam, eggs haven.  This is not the only place in LV.  This place is basic and quick.  Not much to look at but the food hits the spot.  Many of the items on the menu are similar to other places.  The hashed brown was not exactly what we had expected - didn't like it.  One of the order came with a coffee cake and it was a slice of warm buncake with sweet filling.  Strange and strangely nice.  It would be nice to try many items on the menu if I can.  Since this is only 1 exit away from my friend's place, I think it can be done :)"}
{"text":"Had the chance to eat here for a breakfast/brunch.  The location is excellent by Ann Road and 95.  The interior was clean and had a lot of the traditional welcoming breakfast place type feel.  The service was excellent.  A coffee cup never went empty and the waitress took a lot of special requests.  I would say the breakfast food here is good, but does not separate itself in any way shape or form from what you could get at any other breakfast place in the valley.  Sometimes there is something to be said for simplicity and I can respect that.  I'm not asking that the menu become some fusion high end kitchen.  The chicken friend steak was not very crisp, which for me is the make or break point for a chicken fried steak.  The gravy was good, but lacked that extra bit of flavor to set it apart.  All that being said, this is a great place to go if you want a simple, traditional breakfast place.  This place is great for the traditional east coast tastebuds and preferences."}
{"text":"Don't know what happened to this place, it used to be decent, but it was noticeably filthy and the service left us wondering what happened.  After a 30 min wait we were seated and ordered. My wife had the western omelette I had the carnitas omelette. Both our meals came with coffee cake that normally comes right after you place your order but not today. Coffee cake didn't arrive until after our breakfast came and then server only brought us one then after he realized it brought another one. After that we didn't see the server for at least 1/2 hour.  Both of our breakfast were bland and after I salted was still bland. Hash browns were burnt to a crisp. So much so that you could pick up a piece of it and it was like a wafer.  Then we waited another 15-20 min for the check.  The owner should really take a hard look at what this place has become. We will never go back.  Best thing about this place was the two Pepsi's we ordered and the check."}
{"text":"This place was awful! I went into the restaurant on green valley pkwy. I got huevos rancheros  to go  as I work at an office nearby and was craving breakfast. Eggs were not cooked at even though I ordered them hard tortilla was soggy. They didn't put ant cheese and forgot the potatoes. I could of made a better meal in the microwave at work. It was defiantly not worth the almost 12 dollars I paid."}
{"text":"In town for work, yelped for breakfast and found this place. Had the corned beef hash, kinda non-traditional cut in strips instead of chopped, but still very yummy and portions that are barely finishable! Yes, the coffee cake is all everyone says it is. I'll be back for more from the large and diverse menu"}
{"text":"The food was good...the service was great.  I will try the French Toast selection next time and see if that is good.  I felt this was just a typical breakfast place...nothing special but I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Very nice menu selection and presentation. Every dish looks delicious. Food didn't taste fatty/oily like most breakfast places.  Multigrain pancakes were good, and I'm glad they put the whipped butter and syrup on the side so that I can monitor my consumption. The side of berries for $3 more included raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries. About 1 cup's worth.  The Mexican skillet was very delicious. I'm not normally a skillet person, but I think I just became one.  The restaurant's decor is homey with a chicken and egg theme. Cute.  Restaurant was clean. Service was friendly and accomoodating."}
{"text":"TJ says food was good. Service was on time and friendly. Food was not as flavorafull but would definitely come back and try other dishes.  RJ my skillet was great. Excellent service. Quaint neighborhood location. I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Coffee cake is always good. I usually order my usual, country fried chicken steak and eggs with gravy...:) Vegas doesn't have much breakfast places...this suffice the cravings....nothing fancy...more like your fancier version of denny's."}
{"text":"This was my first time at The Cracked Egg, the staff is very friendly, the owners are personable and the restaurant is clean. The food is amazing and the portion size is huge. Definitely plan on going back."}
{"text":"Nice little place outside if Las Vegas. Got the steak breakfast. Steak was a good size and the eggs and hash browns were a good serving. The atmosphere was very home town cafe like. Not noisy at all. Service was great. Asked for a drink when I sat down and my Pepsi never got empty. The staff was very friendly. I am glad my friend recommeded this place for lunch. Not sure if they have wifi."}
{"text":"Eggggg-cellent service, good food, good prices. Server was able to grab me the last piece of pumpkin coffee cake even though they ran out, it was a corner piece that I figure they couldn't sell so she gave it to me free of charge. What a sweetie! That's a winner in my book!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service..always! A very pleasant place to go for breakfast or lunch. Has the feeling of an East Coast diner. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best eggs Benedict's I've had. Service was a bit slow on a weekday but in their defense it was packed. There's some cute outside seating but it's not shaded very well so it's pretty hot and doesn't have that \"outside patio\" feel that other places have. Living in Phoenix/Scottsdale I got super spoiled on patio dining and this place doesn't compare but the food is good. Coffee is blah but I'm sure they aren't known for coffee."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast/brunch spot; one of our favorites! Eggs are cooked right, hash browns rock, coffee cake is delicious!"}
{"text":"My eggs were prepared just right.   Our server knew the menu pretty well and made suggestions which is always appreciated and we received service with a smile, that always makes the food taste better. Lol"}
{"text":"I would cut them some more slack since it's a holiday but they really weren't that busy when we got there and even less busy when we left... The wait was about five minutes and the server was quick and efficient with our drinks and taking our orders. Once our food arrived; however, he was nowhere to be found. My friend Lisa L had the pancakes and I had the tropical french toast... I know the description said coconut but this thing was COVERED in shredded coconut. Like the whole surface was pretty much shredded coconut. The flavor was great and the texture was nice but I literally filled up on shredded coconut. We spent about 20 minutes sitting around waiting for our server to come back so we could get our bill and though he walked by like four times, he didn't so much as glance in our direction. By this time, the crowd had really thinned out too so it's not like it was crazy busy. The food was good enough to warrant three stars but the service left us frustrated. It would be one thing if the server was so busy he couldn't make it through the room but we saw him pass so many times and it took forever to flag him down."}
{"text":"Fairly good food but the coffee cake was not what I was expecting.  Apparently they change the type of coffee cake daily so we got red velvet cake with icing, not real coffee cake. The sign which lists this is only visible when leaving and there is no warning on the menu!  When mentioned to the waitress, no apology in the least!  The raspberries in the mixed fruit bowl were great but the blueberries were over-ripe and awful!  So a mixed experience.  When we went to the cash register, a waitress had leftsomeone's VISA card sitting there with no one manning the register!!  I could have taken a photo, memorized the # or walked away with it!  Pay in person at the register!!"}
{"text":"This is one of those fast in & out type of breakfast places that serves such good food. The eggs are always done right just as you asked for them and the hash browns when ordered crispy aren't just burnt on the outside but soggy on the inside. If you're ever in the neighborhood you should stop in for breakfast, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp because we wanted to try something different from places we normally go to.  Glad we came in for breakfast.   We sat down as soon as we walked in, they brought our drinks out fast.  And our coffee  mugs were always filled.  I had the Mediterranean omelet,  my husband had regular pancakes , eggs, ham and bacon and our daughter had a fruit waffle.  All of our food was very good.  They have a LARGE  selection of food.  I will come here again."}
{"text":"I want to put less than 1 star I didn't even have a chance to sit down and look at the menu when I was rudely turned away from the establishment because I had my dogs with me. Now I wasn't trying to sit inside, I was getting a table on the patio and have my dogs on the outside of the rail. The man said he was the owner, we'll I wish him the worst."}
{"text":"The food here is above average and never greasy, which is very important to me - exceptionally true for breakfast food! I usually order the eggs Benedict and their hollandaise sauce is the best I've ever had. I'm a connoisseur and they are willing to customize my order to meet my dietary needs. I really appreciate that, all of the servers here give exceptional service. Last week while dining for breakfast I asked the waiter about the coffee, it's soooo good and he said it was from a free trade organic source.  I would like to give Sunrise Café five stars and I will when they're the first place in town to offer organic eggs and potatoes for breakfast. Organic is important to me for many reasons and I would be willing to pay a premium to have those options!!! Overall - love this place."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST!  Just came back from a long weekend in LV and we were in dyer need of something other than \"strip & hotel food\".  An individual in my party is also Gluten free so we GOOGLED for Gluten free options for brunch.  The Cracked Egg came up and their menu looked amazing and they did have Gluten free options.  We did see some of their reviews and decided it was worth a try.  We were staying at Luxor, the taxi ride was about $20 but, it was worth it.  We went on Sunday morning about 10:30 and the wait was minimal.  They have an extensive menu, I wanted to have a club sandwich or their grilled cheese but, had to try an omelette.  I was not disappointed, it was delicious.  Also, they have an option of toast or coffee cake with a meal and, do yourself a favor, get the coffee cake. It was warm, it had raspberry filling, it is homeade, I wish I ordered one to take home.  The service was fast and friendly.  Stay away from the buffets and give this place a try.    *If you are coming from the strip, make sure you take down the number for your taxi so they can come back and pick you up.  Our taxi driver was the best and gave us his mobile and picked us up within 15 minutes of calling him.  This place is NOT in walking distance from the strip."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from my mom and sister.  Every time mom would visit sis in Vegas they would always come here.  So naturally I just had to try it out for myself.    The place has a \"mom and pop\" feel to it and is very welcoming.  I love a breakfast that tastes and feels like mom cooked it.  The Cracked Egg delivered that momma cooked feel perfectly.  I order the classic French toast, scrambled eggs, and bacon.  Pretty simple you might say, but this is where other breakfast places come up short.  Others might be able to wow you with exotic breakfast options(which The Cracked Egg also has), but they lose track of the easy stuff.  Not The Cracked Egg!  Eggs were perfect, bacon amazing, and the French toast to die for!  I'm pretty sure the girlfriend and sister loved their dishes too, but I was so wrapped up with enjoying mine I didn't pay attention to them. =)  I could go on for hours on why the food was so good, instead I will just say you gotta come have breakfast if you are in the area.  Plan on making The Cracked Egg a \"go-to\" for breakfast every time I come to visit my sister!"}
{"text":"Good but over prices. I likes the wait staff friendly and on their game however its just over priced the food is okay but not worth this price."}
{"text":"Love the way they have their menu and the  yellow card you have next to you that signals waitress if you need service.  The staff is friendly and  so helpful with recommendations  . This place never fails  Is clean and affordable."}
{"text":"1st time  eating here , the server was so nice and patience  .  We order the Joe breakfast and it was delicious   along with French Toast  with peanut butter . We had a great time and the place looked clean . I will definitely  go back and try more stuff"}
{"text":"I work the graveyard shift and i thought that i should take my family out to eat breakfast/lunch because we never have meals together like that anymore. The food and service was phenomenal, our waitress constantly checks up on us and the french toast was divine. The only reason I've given it a 4 out of 5 is due to the hostess. Apparently she saw us came in, but proceeded to move very very slowly doing what she's doing. Thinking to myself that we have to seat ourselves, but decided to wait and see if anyone says anything. Still standing for a bit and then 2 other groups came in We've all waited. Then she realizes \"oh, there are more people maybe I should do something\". Again, proceeded at a pace of a tortoise. As we dug into our meal, I've began to notice that she continued that trend with every customers walking in as if she doesn't know why she's working there."}
{"text":"Not all it's cracked up to be!  I'm not sure why this place gets such high marks when the service is horrible and the food just so-so.  Went to The Cracked Egg for breakfast with co-workers today and ordered the Big Bad Wolf omelet with sour dough toast, seasoned potatoes and coffee.  The omelet had no seasoning on it and was overcooked (dry).  Their \"seasoned potatoes\" are the frozen bagged stuff you can buy in any supermarket, I think I have a bag in my freezer at home.  The coffee was good, except when I asked for a warm up the waiter topped off my cup with cold coffee and made the half cup I already had colder.  The service was terrible!  I had to get out of my seat twice to walk over and get the waiter for the table, as he took the orders and felt he was done.  For the price you pay, spend your money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Service was great, food came out pretty fast. You really want to try their delicious coffee cake! The omelette I order was okay, food presentation can definitely improve. Overall, it was a good breakfast place."}
{"text":"So I absolutely lovvvvvvved the coffee cake. No complaints. Food was good, service was good. First visit but I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Super good. People are friendly and everything on the menu has been good. Neither of their potato options are all that great (IMHO) but everything else I've gotten there has been great. All of the Cracked Egg locations get VERY crowded at peak times, so get there early.   They have no wifi there (kinda there thing) so bring your own or \"Talk to each other...\""}
{"text":"A really good breakfast and lunch spot that can do the greasy spoon thing or serve healthier options as well. They can get really busy though so if you go during busy times be prepared to wait. They have good skillets and belgian waffles. They also do a French toast Monte Cristo that's really good as well but needs to be eaten at the restaurant and not as takeout. 4 stars because I've had things served colds when they are busy."}
{"text":"Seated right away greeted with a smile tables and floors looked clean . menu is easy to understand the food (THE FOOD) is out of this world everything was delicious especially the steak.  this is by far the best restaurant I've eaten breakfast in . Waitress was very polite and helpful."}
{"text":"The perfect place for brunch! Don't forget, it does close at 3 pm. Haha Just passed through the area & spotted it. My fiancé ordered the parmesan potatoe soup & 1/2 sandwich & I got the club sandwich. The soup was perfect. When I say perfect, I mean it! I love salt & this soup had the perfect mix! With bacon & scallions on top. 10/10. I must warn you, if you get the club, prepare for a monster sandwich to be set in front of you! This thing had three layers of deliciousness in a perfectly toasted package. The avocado was one of my favorite points & was perfectly ripe. I would make a point to visit this place again!"}
{"text":"The egg-themed breakfast joints in Vegas tend to blend together after a while, and while the Cracked Egg is very good, there's nothing terribly distinctive about it either.  We came on a Saturday morning about 10 a.m., so it was prime time, but despite that, we were seated within five minutes. The service was great, with someone taking our drink orders right away and the waitress following up soon thereafter. The menu covers the basics -- omelets, scrambles, skillets and griddle items -- with everything customizable to your liking.  Our drinks came out promptly, and so did the coffee cake that came with my girlfriend's scramble. You'll read about this coffee cake in other Yelpers' reviews, and with good reason: It's warm, soft, slightly gooey, and positively designed to make you crave coffee, as good coffee cake should.  The rest of our food was made perfectly to order, and while not the greatest food ever, definitely solid. The seasoned potatoes could have been a bit more seasoned, but then again, I compare all to the Egg & I's potatoes, so ... sorry, Cracked Egg. ;) Our water and coffee were kept filled and our check came promptly.  Because I live on the opposite side of the valley from the Cracked Egg, I probably wouldn't seek it out again (as other comparable venues such as Eggworks are closer), but if I was in the neighborhood one morning? Sure!"}
{"text":"This place is a typical breakfast place. Arrived on a Mon 9a and no line. Had the Joe's Special. It was ok although it had cream cheese in it which I found odd and didn't like. Should have had them remove it. Potatoes ok.   Pros:  Big variety. From egg dishes to all the typical breakfast dishes. Good coffee cake.   Cons:  Service was slow and inattentive. Waited 10 min before acknowledged. Waited 25 min for food. Waitress always running around had to get her attention.   Probably would come back. Sure filled up my tummy."}
{"text":"Great place! I come here at least three times a year.  -friendly staff -reasonable prices for decent portions -club sandwich - YUM! -all salads are great -fast service, even if you have to wait to be seated"}
{"text":"Really really good food was really awesome first time here better than waffle house. I defenantly recommend this place I am buying a house nearby and wanted to try the local places."}
{"text":"Food deserves 5 stars. Service deserves 1 star. Mexican skillet was awesome. Sister loved the monte cristo sandwich. We were a party of 6 and no one in our party ever got their water or coffee refilled. Waitress (Vanessa, I think) never asked about our food. Would return weekly if service was up to par. As it is our return is questionable"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. Enjoyed the Greek omelet and love the surprise of a different coffee cake."}
{"text":"I was very irate with the staff as they do not know what the laws are when it come to service animals at this establishment, My friend who is a Gulf War Vet has a service dog for his PTSD, and was treated very rudely at this eatablishment.  I have been here numerous times, but never again and I will be sure to voice my opinion to everyone i meet.  We went to sit on the patio on a slow day and were told to leave and when we informed them that the dog was a service animal they said they needed proof, He then told them that that they were not allowed to ask for papers, and what kind of service animal he is and  tried to inform them that the 2 questions they were able to ask, \"Is that a servcie dog?\" \"What has he been trained to do?\"  the waitress walked away from us before he could finish..  I WAS SO IRATE AT OUR TREATMENT we decided to go else where to spend our money.  The fact that they have not trained their staff is no excuse.  I am more upset at this than my friend is.  They should take the time to review the Americans with Disabilities Act. Ignorance is no excuse.   The thing I was looking forward to this morning was the fresh coffe cake that they serve, but it is not enough to bring us back, and a fresh doughnut from Krispy Kreams is worth the drive, and they gave my friend some water in a bowl for his service animal as we had our doughnut."}
{"text":"There are 2 requirements for the perfect brunch place: comforting food and warm service. The Cracked Egg nails the service. The servers and front of house staff are so friendly. It's like being around family. I could rave about the staff.  As for the food, it's good, just not great. I've tried two dishes here. They're solid, but I wish that there was just a bit more flavor.   The prices are decent, and I would come back. Maybe, I just haven't found the best dish yet."}
{"text":"This place was great!! It was the firs time trying for my fiance & I.  Our server gave great suggestions on what to get and our food was delivered super quick after ordering.  I got the crossant breakfast sandwich & my man got the pancakes with a side of kicken potatoes with eggs on top.  Would recommend to any breakfast lover! We'll be back"}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for a family Bday and was looking for a local breakfast spot. Yelped and found the egg. Busy place! in a food court? Had my doubts but the food was good and the service was good. Nothing SUPER but GOOD. Probably would go again."}
{"text":"We've been going here for a long time. My wife and I spot once or twice a week after we drop our daughters off to school. Breakfast date... We would bring our daughters when they don't have school. Great place food is good and staff are awesome. But recently they hired a new hostess. Short girl with black hair. We are regulars and she obviously didn't know that but she was very rude to us. Especially to my wife. So unprofessional, her attitude sucked. This was on 6/9/17. We would go every Fridays but today 6/16/17 we didn't go. We called to talk to manager that day. We don't like complaining but they need to know what kine of people they hire. Hopefully she changes her attitude. For now they lost our business. We were just treated terribly in front of our daughters. Sad..."}

{"text":"I was really looking forward to a good breakfast, and assumed this place was owned by the same people as The Egg and I, but the menus are not the same, so I think they are just trying to use similar fonts on the sign.    Anyway...not impressed at all.  The prices were very high for breakfast, and the food was not great.  The fillings for my omelet were diced so finely that they were hard to find, and the cheese was just sprinkled on top, so it wasn't a very cheesy omelet.  The seasoned potatoes tasted like frozen potatoes cooked up with some seasoning put on them, a little too chewy.  My husband wasn't happy with his meal either.  Everything was basically rather bland.  The service was friendly and prompt, so no complaints there.       I already have plenty of favorite breakfast places, and unfortunately this one didn't hit the mark."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The wait is well worth it. We ate here once so far and it reminds us of our favorite whole in the wall back in so cal. Portions are nicely sized and the service is great."}
{"text":"Not worth the money.  Little disappointed - eggs nothing special  and hashbrowns still frozen in the middle. Nice atmosphere but honestly how can you screw up breakfast food!"}
{"text":"Never a bad dinning experience here, like the menu. The staff always prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone can go to a place like IHOP or Denny's voluntarily when they could go to The Cracked Egg. My girlfriend and I had had the worst night of our lives, our dog was in a veterinary hospital overnight sick - we didn't get much sleep (there was a lot of weeping involved). We woke up, knowing we would pick him up at noon and thought - goddamn it, I deserve a good breakfast after all this! And the Cracked Egg is that kind of place. This is food and service that could mend you, body and soul...  I ordered their croissant sandwich and my date ordered an omelette with bacon, cheese, and avocado (the serving of avocado was very generous - for those wondering). We both opted for hash browns. The hash browns here are WAY better fare than you would get elsewhere, although they are greasy to a fault. Still, it's like IHOP hash browns on steroids. These hash browns would make IHOP hash browns pee their pants in fear. It reminded me of something my grandma from Oklahoma would pull out in the morning, made in a skillet - low on presentation, high on deliciousness and love.  The wait was manageable if you're an early riser, service was extremely prompt. We received several offers of more coffee, water, milk etc, were asked if everything was good, from many different waiters and our main waiter was smiling, happy, and clearly a kind guy.  We ended up spending $30, around $15 per person for three drinks and two HUGE platters of food. For the quality and service (and the fact that you're supporting a smaller business) it's worth it."}
{"text":"We go to lunch/brunch here almost every weekend... Best breakfast/brunch place we've found in Vegas..."}
{"text":"Met with a friend for breakfast, first time to this location and I liked that it wasn't crazy busy like it would be on a weekend. Our waitress was attentive and nice. I got a mix up with my order but she immediately fixed it. I got the California omelette, it was tasty but I wish they cut the bacon into prices rather than have two big strips in it to where u have to use a butter knife to cut it to pieces. The coffee cake was good, I just didn't have a sweet tooth at the moment. Overall all experience was pleasant."}
{"text":"This place is a great breakfast spot.  I have yet to venture into their lunch menu.  I'm enjoying the coffee cake that comes with breakfast.  So far it has been a different one on every visit.  My breakfast is usually simple, egg whites and some bacon.  The hash-brown is also great, it is never over cooked.   Service is outstanding and it's in a great location with lots of parking."}
{"text":"A good place for a quick breakfast or lunch.  Food is consistent and service is timely  Sign up for the rewards club and you will get monthly coupons  Kids meals are good and affordable"}
{"text":"Really have been on a breakfast/brunch kick for the last few weekends, and The Cracked Egg helped in the search of finding a new place to eat. For a busy Sunday morning we were seated quickly by the friendly staff. Our order came out fast, and was delicious. You will not leave this place hungry, and will definitely need a box to go. Make sure to try the coffee cake!"}
{"text":"I ordered the croissant French toast with berries and bananas. Sounds good, right? Well you know that smell when you walk into Petsmart or Petco? That's what my French toast tasted like :( I was so bummed.. I ate about half till I couldn't take it anymore. It barely had the flavor of French toast, it was more like a croissant pressed down on the griddle with a little butter, with an added Petsmart flavor, lol. I don't know what it was. I finished off the berries, bananas, and my side of eggs. My son ordered a basic eggs, sausage, and pancakes.. which you can't go wrong with that! The pancakes were yummy and the eggs were cooked perfectly. Our waitress, Traci, was vibrant and cheerful. My son loved her! She was awesome. I just wished my French toast tasted like French toast."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to try this place out. She's lives in Vegas but doesn't usually eat breakfast until I came to visit. She had the corned beef hash which is not what you'd expect. It's thinly slice strips of corned beef cooked with onions and bell peppers. She was expecting the more mushy type but she still enjoyed this one. I ordered the eggs benedict which was really good. The hollandaise sauce was delicious! The coffee cake itself was so soft of fluffy. mmmm I'd like to come back to try some of their other breakfast dishes. Gotta wait till October to come back to Vegas though. Oh well, this will be worth the wait."}
{"text":"This was not a great experience. It was my first but my wife's 2nd time and when our waitress arrived finally my wife sighed as this was the same one she had before. The waitress is lucky to remember which shoe goes which foot as she writes down order but cannot seem to get it right, at least for 2 visits total by us. The special was terrible and biscuits with other it were rocks. Also we were told when explaining food, that was barely touched, was very bad and we would like it removed from bill, we were told they had a 3 bite rule.....Although hilarious, the waitress was serious. For us, this was terrible. But if you have young kids who cannot seem to keep quiet, this is perfect as it gets so loud that it really won't matter and they get Mickey Mouse pancakes. So if ya keep it simple for you and low expectations then give it a shot"}
{"text":"Food is decent, close to our house. I would give it a higher rating but my water glass and coffee cups remain empty most of the time. It's hard to get the waiter's attention for refills. Also, I can't believe they only give military discounts if the member is in uniform. Evidently a government issued ID card isn't enough. We've tried this place several times but from now on I'll drive an extra 15 mins to 'that other egg place in town' where their clever little egg sign allows waiters and waitresses to know when you need something. Oh yeah, and there a military ID card is enough to get a discount anytime."}
{"text":"Great service, horrible food!!! Don't get anything with beans. They were old and crusty. Waffles were chewy, home fries were dried up.  Would not come back!!"}
{"text":"Great service and food, we were seated right away didn't have to wait at all. The club sand which was delicious and had large pieces of avocado on it. Would highly recommend this place for a breakfast or lunch meal. Try the banana chocolate chip pancakes, a little sweet but amazing."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of Cracked egg. Not just because it is very close to my work that is why I always go there for lunch. But cracked egg always keep me full with their amazing eggs omelet. Downsides are it is pretty pricey and that it is always always busy around lunch time, and I will always have to wait for a table for party more than 4 people."}
{"text":"This place only gets a single star and that's only because our waitress was so kind. We were excited to come to this new location. Came after a walk with my friends and small dog. We sat on the patio and ordered. When the waitress was finishing our order she informed us we could not stay with our dog. We said okay we'll put her on the other side of the railing. She informed us she didn't think we could do that either. I informed her at other restaurants as long as the dog wasn't in their \"dinning area\" it should be okay. She left to ask the manager. The owner came out.....actually stood in the door way. In a very curt tone informed us I'm not serving you. I don't care what side the dog is on. No apology nor any sound of remorse or empathy in his voice. I see now why you and your partner have problems.  We left and had a lovely pet friendly breakfast at EGG WORKS"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service. Went here 2x on business trip and loved it!  Generous portions for both meals. Coffee cake is great! Recommend the skillets!"}
{"text":"This is my goto breakfast spot. It's also on my \"When they come from out of town go here\" list.  Kind of small so sometimes the wait is longer than I like but the grub is top notch and so is the service.  They could use some upholstery upgrades in some of the booths.  Boney butts will not be happy in the main dining room.  That's where one of my stars went. Aside from that this place rocks."}
{"text":"The hostess is completely scattered brain and rude. I understand this is a busy place for breakfast but I called and placed a order to go at 1:00pm and by the time I got there she never even put it in the system and told me that no one ever called. I showed her proof on my phone and then the next thing you know the manager came up and saw my order written down on the order slip. A little aggravated she then all a sudden remembered me calling and apologized. I work at a restaurant 10 x busier than this place and a mistake like this is very unprofessional. I hope they work on this or get a more suitable host."}
{"text":"I found a new breakfast diner spot in the valley..yes!!! The server kept the coffee topped off, the Chicano Benny was amazing.  English muffins  were crispy and provided great texture with the eggs. Also lots of Chorizo and the potatoes were good too! They have pride in their food. I also discovered they grind their own beans for the coffee.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I reviewed yelp on this restaurant and it seemed to be pretty good. The noise level was terrible. You had to yell at others in your party in order to be heard. Must just be bad acoustics (really bad). The burrito I ordered was very good, but they charged $1.50 for a little bit of salsa to go with it. Salsa always come with a burrito. Do not get the seasoned potatoes. They suck. I don't know what spice or seasoning they put on them but they are not good at all. Aside from spending $30 for 2 breakfasts with juice is a lot of money that would be well spent elsewhere. The burrito and my wife's scramble were good though, and if I ever return there, I will not order the seasoned potatoes and I will wear earplugs."}
{"text":"We often visit with coupons mailed to us. Probably worth full price though. The breakfast has always been good and I actually think the Club Sandwich on sourdough with Muenster and avocado is my favorite thing. Yum!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat! We were a group of 13 and with that much people your bound to wait awhile to be seated. That was the only problem we had was waiting to be seated. But after awhile the lady noticed we were getting restless so she sat us down in 2 separate tables but right next to each other which worked out great. Everything we had was brought out quick and super delicious! I had the country fried steak which was cooked to perfection and my boyfriend had the monte cristo which was also amazing! Our waitress was even kind enough to split the bill for us."}
{"text":"Love this breakfast place, service is good, food is great, servers are really nice, have come to know some of them from my freqent visits.  Also been to the one on rainbow, same thing, very consistent."}
{"text":"I'd give it 6 stars.  Came for a 3 day visit and we had to come back twice.  Everything was top notch - food, service, decor.  It has a homey feel but it's also very clean and bright.  Thanks for offering gluten free pancakes."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time based on the reviews and have to say I was somewhat let down...Don't get me wrong service was great, the ladies we're attentive, and the prices and portions were even better....BUT the food I think was only so so...had a skillet and it said was homemade chorizo...not saying that its not but it taste like chorizo I've had from a local supermarket..very olive oil and vinegary tasting...Maybe I'll give it another try to be fair, but no rush."}
{"text":"So today is June 30th. My girlfriend and I decided to get breakfast after adventuring downtown and going to donut bar.  Unfortunately today I'm going to have to say this review should be a 1 star.  My girlfriend had initially ordered the chicken fried steak. But once we got it, she said it was all soggy. I poked my fork into it, and I didn't even hear the slightest crunch. On top of that, the gravy is a bit too thick, and the flavor just simply overpowered the taste of the steak.  Since that wasn't the best, she decided to grab the bacon cheeseburger skillet with no bacon.  It's so overloaded with cheese, that it looked unappetizing and unappealing! Basically looks like a hamburger helper with potatoes instead of macaroni!  I'm sorry to say this, but how do you mess up coffee? Like wtf how do you fuck can you mess up coffee?!  But on the plus side you guys get an extra star today because the potatoes tasted pretty good!  Service wasn't all that great.  I ordered chicken tenders, then as the waitress repeated the order back to me, she said chicken tenders, but in the end when the food came out, she brought out a chicken fried steak. If you have a piece of paper with the initial order, how are you going to bring out a different one?!   I completely lost my appetite as soon as my actual order came out. As I said earlier, the gravy's taste ruined whole dish.  We're gonna go home and recook everything we just ordered today.  Completely ruined our day."}
{"text":"Getting very dusty and dirty in there. Hire a cleaning lady look up dust is flying down into people's food."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast spot! The entire staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. You may wait, but that's because this is such a great place. The food is delicious and the waiters always have something to recommend or are always able to change the order per a request. The price is fine, unless you're cheap. So if you're cheap, go eat at some casino with mediocre food."}
{"text":"Pretty cool joint for b-fast I guess.  not a good hangover spot-too loud.    Yummy everything though.  Eggs bennie, waffles, some crazy contraption called the cracked egg croissant which is so right.  minus 1 star for the noise, another for no mimosas.  I should take another one off for the totally spaced out gang of hostesses working at the front who coudnt understand the meaning of \"in a hurry\" to save their life.  I will let it slide."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Excellent food, excellent service! The people here are always friendly and welcoming. And you will never leave hungry with the portions they serve ."}
{"text":"Mom and I stopped in here for a brunch type number.  Of course, at a place called The Cracked Egg you're inspired to choose from the breakfast menu.  I had two eggs over medium, dry wheat toast and hash browns with coffee and she had two scrambled eggs with sliced tomatoes and coffee cake.  The service is fast, sweet and never let your mugs go thirsty.  They serve the coffee cake hot which is an awesome touch.  Everything was good, nothing in the great category.  Mom and I both thought the coffee cake, while moist and soft  to the extreme, was a sugar overload for us and she rued the decision to order toast.  So all in all, 3 to 3.5 stars.    P.S.  If I were in the throes of a hangover this place is not quite greasy enough, which is a great thing since I wasn't drunk.  :)"}
{"text":"Cracked egg has  perfectly made hash brown. Staff is friendly and food is yummy. One of my favorite breakfast spots in Summerlin."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of brunch places and I've added this one to my list. I went for the western omelet and was thoroughly satisfied. They also give you a choice of toast or coffee cake. Umm coffee cake please! This is a good place to stop and load up your last morning in Vegas before the looooong drive back home."}
{"text":"the service took forever and i'm really tired of it i'm writing this review i'm also upset a bit i was just trying to get an omelet and get lit   the cracked egg disappoints like my riddle i'd rather be under a tree with a fiddle   don't eat here if you're in a hurry the service is as cold as a DQ flurry"}
{"text":"I usually go to sunrise cafe on eastern but decided to come here due to the long wait time at sunrise . Turned out to be a horrible decision . Although the staff were all friendly , the food on the other hand was horrible. I ordered the veggie Bennie eggs Benedict with an order of sausage patties (comes in twos). My egg muffin got too soggy , the hash browns were undercooked and there was too much spinach. Proportions were off and the food tasted too salty . I would recommend people to go somewhere else for breakfast. Unless you are dying of hunger , I would recommend one to go anywhere else ."}
{"text":"The Crack Egg I thought was just American. But they have some Mexican dishes there. Able to enjoy a little of both worlds.  Do to my health issues. I'm on a special diet. There salad was just amazing. I enjoyed every bite of it. The waiter was so patient with me. He explain all my questions on prepration on the menu. Excellent customer service..."}
{"text":"Most amazing place for breakfast the coffee cake is amazing and the main reason I come here. There is usually a wait but I am totally fine with that because of the service and food being out of this world. The eggs tasted real not like any of that egg beater stuff other places use. The potatoes were fresh and tasted amazing.  It is very clean and the staff are all very friendly a waitress that was not taking care of us came over to check on us and we were not her table. They are all very caring it was overall an amazing experience. Definitely try it out."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot!  Service and food are great! Portions are large.  The coffee cake --- warm and worth coming back again and again for!"}
{"text":"I really liked the omlet that I had here. I couldn't finish the hash browns, even though they were crisp on the outside and perfectly cooked. The coffee cake is very deceiving, very lite like an angels food cake consistncy but it filled me up quickly. I still can't decide whether I liked the coffee cake or not. It was a little too lite and very crumbly to the point I was wondering if it was undercooked but it had a nice taste although a tad sweet.  Service was eggcelent. Next time I'm in town, I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Pumpkin Coffee Cake season, they always change the flavor up.  Delish & steaming fresh out of the oven, amen!  The best part of waiting for our car at the dealership a mile away.  Smaller, w/ an outdoor seating area, than the GVR location.  Both need to reorganize the cashier/hostess cluster situation that happens in front of the entrance/exit.  Holy cow.  Delicious Homemade Corned Beef Hash, Scrambled Eggs, hashbrowns under & side of seasoned potatoes.  It's all very filling large enough portions so Mom & I shared.  Dad enjoyed his two eggs over-easy, seasoned potatoes & toast.  The three of us shared the coffee cake, which is large enough too as well.    Service was fantastic.  Uber picked us up in less than 5.  One of the best times to go is Monday before the rush starts at 8:45am."}
{"text":"The Californian Omelette with freshly squeezed orange juice is amazing!!!! Great place to hang out and have breakfast. Try their coffee cake too!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Breakfast place in Vegas. It has a great staff always friendly! The food is alway sooo fresh and good! The Eggs Benedict is my favorite! I also love the Buffalo chicken salad."}
{"text":"Ok place to have some real deal breakfast. Very close to my house so it's kinda the go to spot. One thing I didn't like was the eggs was kinda dry and hash browns was soggy. The biscuits and gravy was also ok. Season potatoes was great. I would only go back because it's down the street."}
{"text":"We enjoy coming to the cracked egg because we live very close and the food is pretty tasty. The plus side of this place is that the restaurant is clean, cozy and has some friendly staff members (all additional to pretty good food).     The downside is the service is lacking a 5 star rating. The hosts are always behind the counter and to busy to always be paying attention. For a restaurant that gets this busy they really need to hire extra staff. I don't view them as rude, because they're doing the best they can. Its just not top customer service. Its normal to see newbies walk in & not know what to do from lack of a greeting.         The waiters/waitresses are very quick- not to chatty. For some this is a plus, so its really a matter of preference. Personally I enjoy a \"hello, welcome,how are you?\" Type of intro. Especially for first time- menu recommendations, which are always a plus coming from an employee.      The prices seem a bit high to me for what you get. Granted the food is good.. but for a $9-13 omelet I expect a bit more.     I will say their coffee cake is always a hit with us. No matter what the flavor is.       Better than a big time chain breakfast place like IHOP or Denny's but has room to improve. Either way we enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST breakfast restaurant in Las Vegas hands down. The food is wonderful and the service is impeccable. Our favorite servers are Aurelia and Alfredo. They are great! We go there so often that when my husband and I arrive they have two diet cokes at our table before we even order. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I always judge my breakfast based upon the quality of the eggs and toast. The eggs were good, thy were not like eating plastic. The sourdough toast was very good! Also there menu selection is very good for the person who does not have an idea what they want. It's worth a try for anyone."}
{"text":"I love monte cristo sandwiches and I am very critical of the dipping sauce. That being said syrup is never an option for a true monte cristo... and it should have not then on thin slice of ham and turkey... in a word \"disappointing\" But the service was great"}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg is a nice place to grab a good breakfast or tasty lunch. It is on the smaller side, and it is pretty much always busy, so expect a wait. We try to hit it around 1pm on Saturday, and it's not as bad as around 11am.   Service is a little hit or miss; the servers have always been friendly, but sometimes on the slow side. Only once out of about 10 times did our food take too long. Seasoned potatoes are tasty, as are the skillets and sandwiches.   Downside: It is pricey for the type of food. I'm guessing that's because of its location. We haven't been to any of their other locations, so we can't compare. Check their website for coupons."}
{"text":"Good service, great potato soup and Turkey sammie and my bf enjoyed his eggs and hash browns at 2:45pm!!so that made me happy because he's a breakfast snob! He swears he's a food critic. So yay! We shall return oh and the price is right too!"}
{"text":"I put off coming here for a while cuz when was Fast Eddie's it was horrible service and food most sucked but this new place is actually pretty good I had their vegetarian omelette which I like but most the time it's always really watery and in a bird egg soup by the end but there's was perfect not really need water and dry play afterwards awesome I've been have a bite of my son's waffle which they need some improvement needs to be little more crispy just a little too soggy for my taste and the girls were great friendly and happy I mean it's a fast Diner so even the manager came over and introduced himself which that rarely happens and a place like this definitely go back"}
{"text":"Like always, another tasty breakfast. The earlier the better. Went today at 0800 n no waiting, actually had empty tables. That didn't last long though, the place fills up quick because of the people and the food. The employees are always friendly n the food is good."}
{"text":"My daughter and I came here for the first time and we were very happy with the service, cost, and the food was great. I had the veggie egg Benedict and she had something else (I forgot) lol. But anyways, I'm definitely coming back even though I waited 35 mins to be seated. It was Sunday 11am so i can't complain. (Did I just complain?) Aahahaha.."}
{"text":"Good service excellent food!  The seasoned potatoes and hash browns are awesome. Crisp and not oily. We liked the scrambled eggs, enchilada omelette, and the coffee cake."}
{"text":"This was one of the first 'non-chain' places I have been since I moved to Vegas. My boyfriend and I went this last weekend for an easy breakfast and I thought it was pretty good. The lady that took our order was really nice, and although it has nothing to do with the food it had always puts me in a good mood while eating after the staff has been friendly.  I had the jalapeño spread on an asiago bagel with cheese and was satisfied. I really like spicy foods and was glad that it was actually hot rather than more of a spiced cream cheese. It was a bit pricy for a bagel but I can definitely see myself going back there for a quick bite."}
{"text":"It's breakfast, not much can necessarily go wrong. Greet, water, coffee, digs (omelet, huevos rancheros and fruit plate). Good conversation. Ample parking and kind service."}
{"text":"For the best breakfast selection served with their fresh homemade muffins, this is the place to go in Las Vegas. They have several locations and I've been to them all. The food is excellent and the service the same."}
{"text":"Really awesome place to have breakfast. Try the Taylor Breakfast with polish sausage & Make your own skillet with polish sausage delicious :).Staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"The food was amazing but the customer service was not so great, we couldn't get our server to come to our table!!"}
{"text":"My family and I go to breakfast every Sunday this Sunday we decided to try the cracked egg on rainbow and sunset very big mistake we all order drinks everything came but they forgot a coffee no big deal the waiter said he will be right back with a Nother cup 20 minutes later I had to go track him down to say hey we are still waiting on the coffee To top it off the food came out wrong when I asked for a manager the guy  walked out from the kitchen I told him I don't want anything for free I just want to bring this to your attention and began to explain he looked at me as if I was stupid said sorry and walked away like that's crazy first and last time we ever go there"}
{"text":"After my second visit I'm finally writing a review. If you're visiting from out of town or a local this is the spot for breakfast. It's about a 2 minute drive down Charleston from the Red Rock Resort and just a few minutes from Badlands golf course.   On this visit I brought my family. My son was begging for room service but since he decided to wake up at 6 am I decided to drag them out for a real breakfast. Service was excellent! Ordered drinks and they were out before I could check in on yelp. The coffee here is really good. I like the mugs they serve in.   Kids menu is simple and all of the items are inexpensive. The kids each wanted an order of chocolate chip pancakes but I think they could have split an order because the pancakes are a good size and dense; 7 yr old had 1 and 5 yr old had .75 of 1.   Wife ordered the garden veggie omelette, $9.85. Comes with choice of hash browns or house potatoes, and choice of toast or coffee cake. Do yourself a favor and splurge on the coffee cake. It's a whole lot of food. I went with the sweet potato skillet, $10.75. Has the same options as the aforementioned meal. All that food was only $41+$10 tip. One of my favorite breakfast spots.  Right now the coffee cake has gingerbread cream cheese filling, probably a seasonal thing because of Xmas time. Last time I was here in summer the regular coffee was just as good.   Stop by for breakfast if you are hanging out by red rock. They do have several of these establishments around Vegas. Hope you get to try it out. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Great  mom and  pop diner style restaurant.  They have their own brand of coffee to purchase.  Great blueberry pancakes.  Perfectly poached eggs. Great service from Theresa."}
{"text":"Service: super super fast. Coffee: tasted like water. Coffee cake: delicious. El vaquero omelette: not flavor at all. Pancakes, yummy Bacon, jam, sausage omelette: super yummy  Seasoned potatoes: dry as hell."}
{"text":"My favorite go-to breakfast spot in Las Vegas.  Yes there's higher quality joints but I would go to The Cracked Egg over any breakfast chain. It's really egg-celent!    Favorites: Northshore scramble, Chorizo Skillet, Eggs Benny's.   Awesome: Complimentary Coffee Cake.  BEST COFFEE CAKE....EVER! TIP: If there's 2 of you, skip the wait and sit at the counter/bar.  The service staff is warm and friendly. My water is never empty.  The place has modest breakfast themed deco on the walls.  The wait for a seat on a weekend can take a while (sometimes up to 30min, no one likes to wait for breakfast) but we are always OK with sitting at the counter where there's usually a spot open and you get to see the action of the servers behind the counter.  The quality of the food is eggs-emplary! Everything taste fresh, including the fresh fruit if it comes with your dish.  The coffee cake is delicious (different flavors every week, my fav is the ones with fruit).  The eggs are rarely over done or underdone (I order over easy on my skillets).  The potatoes are crispy and hot. The coffee is standard but I'll let that slide cause this place isn't called \"The cracked bean\".  Overall, Cracked egg is an eggs-traordinary breakfast spot! Good eats and good meets. Try it today! YAY!"}
{"text":"Originally I discovered the The Cracked Egg on Rainbow years ago. I am glad they have a second location close to where I am living. I think one of their highlights is their Homemade Coffee Cake. I used to ask which flavor they currently had available but soon stopped after I had a few different ones and they were ALL delicious. This morning I was treated to Blueberry! I've had Apple, Peach and Cherry as well.  When I crave going out for breakfast which is usually on the weekends, The Cracked Egg is on the top of my list. My favorite is their \"Californian\" omelet which has sliced bacon, sliced avocados and jack cheese with seasoned potatoes on the side.  Based on my visits to both locations their service and food are great. They seem to always have plenty of people around taking care of guests so even if your server is busy you can always find someone to get you a refill or extra condiments, etc.  I think their prices are fair and portion sized from my experience and what friends/family have ordered is good.  If you beat the breakfast rush you should get seated within a timely manner. I went around 10AM and was able to get a seat at the counter right away and they appeared to have a few tables open. When I was paying my bill to leave they were slammed with people crowding the entrance waiting for tables.  Always leave full and enjoy going to The Cracked Egg for a weekend breakfast. Also a side note, on some occasions I had phoned in my breakfast order with their Rainbow location and within a timely manner went to pay/pickup and enjoy at home."}
{"text":"Seriously, Yay!  I'm a fan.  While I do love my fancy brunches with mimosas on deck, I still very much love a good old fashioned breakfast.  Old fashioned as in  ... crispy edges on my pancake, fried eggs fried hard, bacon cooked hard, hot lumpy grits.  That's the kind of old fashioned breakfast I like and that's exactly what I received when I dined at \"The Cracked Egg\".    My boyfriend and I tried The Cracked Egg after leaving GCU at 8am in the morning.  I noticed the huge sign on the outside window for a special for $5.99.  Since it's an old fashioned diner I figured the special was for seniors so I didn't bother paying much attention to it.    We entered and seated immediately.  We weren't extremely hungry so we decided to share a meal.  We were going share a 2 piece pancake combo with pork sausage, hash browns and eggs and an extra order of turkey sausage.  The waitress wrote our order down but then said, \"Hey we're running a special.  2 pancakes, 2 eggs, hash browns and a meat for 5.99 before 10am\".  WHAT?!  That's exactly what we were about to order with the addition of the extra meat but for way more money.  SO ... the special we ordered!  Everything was perfect.  Between the two of us we were not able to finish the pancakes and hash browns. The portions were huge.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Have been going to this place for many years. The coffee cake is what gets us to go - though it's changed over the years, it still doesn't disappoint (especially when it comes out warm). All of the other dishes are done well and everyone is usually really friendly. Cozy (and not cheap) atmosphere so great to bring family and kids."}
{"text":"Found a great place. Never been here and I can't believe I have missed this place. You walk in the door and they great you and made comfortable.  Food was outstanding. Biscuits and gravy will only order half order the whole is huge.  Biscuits are home made. The lumberjack was great with high protein outstanding.  We will be back. Prices are are excellent as well."}
{"text":"I personally think this is an ok place. I would actually rather have IHOP over the Cracked Egg. My fiance and I ordered Steak and Eggs, as our no carb breakfast.. It was not done correctly, but they took so long to even cook it that i didnt want to change it. I had to eat this tough piece of meat and I couldnt even finish it because my gums started hurting.  I have been here a few times before, so I want to give them the benefit of the doubt. Our server was really nice, and it wasnt her fault that the cooks didnt cook it correctly. And the previous times I have been here, I choose something simple like oatmeal and stuff.   There are better breakfast places around I say."}
{"text":"First off, let me just say I LOVE a place that still puts a Monte Cristo sandwich on the menu, even if I did make a New Year's resolution about fried foods.  I like old school friendly coffee shops and this has that charm.  Sadly, that's where it ended for us.  My Monte Cristo (did you think I wouldn't order it?), while tasty inside, was overdone and dark brown, not golden, just this side of burnt. It wasn't very big, nor loaded with meat, which is weird for a Monte Cristo since the whole idea of a triple layer ham, swiss and turkey sandwich dipped in french toast batter, fried and coated in powdered sugar is to be colossal and leave you stuffed.  The bread was standard grocery store loaf size.  It was offered with potatoes or hash browns, but I ordered fruit, which was melon and not very good.  End of story for me.  Hub had the House Original sandwich; roast beef and cream cheese with red onion , tomato and lettuce.  He asked for no tomato, and also sadly ordered fruit.  The sandwich was a shocker, with no more than a 1/4 lb of meat and cream cheese spread thin.  It also had tomato on it...oops. The beef was not freshly sliced.  The bread was again nothing special, average size and not extremely fresh.  For a signature sandwich, it was a big disappointment to my better half.  We were both still hungry when we left.  The service was very nice, quick, and pleasant, though I don't particularly like being called 'dear' by someone maybe 10 to 15 years younger than me.  I'm not a blue hair!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place because it is fast, convenient, great service and just plain old good breakfast. I highly recommend this restaurant and it is also family friendly."}
{"text":"This place doesn't believe in using salt on their food. Very bland. I ordered Tori's Tortilla which is suppose to be a chorizo and egg burrito. It's not chorizo in the slightest. Basically tasted like ground beef with eggs and it was gross. Not authentic chorizo at all. I switched it out for a Californian omelet with sweet potatoes on the side and while it was better than that sorry chorizo burrito, it was also bland. The server completely skipped on bringing me my toast but by then I was over being there and didn't care for more bland food. The potatoes had absolutely no seasoning. My husband had the blueberry pancakes and he was disappointed. They were not fluffy and he compared it to \"concrete\". I'll also mention that we constantly had whiffs of seriously burnt food that you kinda wanted to run from.   Needless to say, we won't be back. The food is terrible. I don't know how they are in business. I should have just driven a little further to my favorite breakfast spot...Egg Works. Way better than this place!   Not coming back here."}
{"text":"I wish I give The Cracked Egg a terrible review so I can keep it all to myself.  But it is my favorite breakfast/lunch place in Vegas.  The decor is sort of country chic, with booths and tables.  You can sit outside, inside or at the bar.  On weekends, at peak times, there is often a wait to get a table, so plan accordingly!  To me, it's worth the wait.  The food is awesome.  My \"go to\" lunch is \"The Club\" sandwich, piled so high with meats, cheese, tomatoes, avocados and lettuce that it actually needs the long toothpick to hold it together.  And the avocados are actually ripe and tasty.  As a Californian, that's super important to me.  (There's not much worse than an unripe avocado!)  I usually eat half and take the rest home.  I've had both fruit as a side, as well as potato salad.  I loved the potato salad, which is homemade, using red potatoes.  I crave their blueberry pancakes.  They're pretty simple.  Blueberry pancakes.  Short stack is three large pancakes.  But they use fresh blueberries.  So it's perfect.  It goes great with their fresh-squeezed orange juice.  I've also had their Denver omelette.  Cooked perfectly, with a nice layer of cheese on top.  Seasoned potatoes are awesome.  If you opt for hash browns, they are crispy and perfectly cooked.  Service was attentive.  The waitress checked every few minutes to see if we needed anything.  Bathrooms are very clean.  All in all, I love this place.  It's not fancy.  But if you want a solid breakfast/lunch spot with lots of options, this is a good one."}
{"text":"Love this place! Today I had the multi grain pancakes with mixed berries, yum!"}
{"text":"There is a wait most of the time but good breakfast spots are hard to find, especially on this side of town. Service is hit or miss but the food quality is always there. There specials are definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"We decided to take the day off from the strip and go to Red Rock Canyon. On the way we found this great little gem. The food was amazing and the portions are HUGE. I had a build your own skillet and was in heaven with my choice and the sourdough toast was to die for! SO glad we found this!"}
{"text":"They get points for having a gluten free menu and being very nice. And maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but I was just not impressed with the cooking skills. I got a skillet breakfast, which is a choose-what-you-want sort of thing. I got scrambled eggs, broccoli, spinach, onions and mushrooms, with extra crispy hash browns. So what I got was cooked hash browns (my friend's were JUST barely cooked, not crispy at all) underneath steamed veg and then my scrambled eggs. Not integrated at all, and barely cooked, zero flavor. The onions were basically raw. No salt, no butter, no flavor. But healthy! My friend got the biscuits and gravy benedict which he liked. It was small and OK. I would try it again and get something different. Very nice staff and a great patio."}
{"text":"We have tried the cracked egg twice for breakfast and both times were very average.  The food is very average and the waiters either forgot our order or could not be bothered.  Las Vegas has several great places to eat so good luck."}
{"text":"I honestly wanted to love this place, but the food was very underwhelming.  I ordered eggs, bacon and hash browns. I found myself piling on the salt and pepper to give it flavor. My boyfriend ordered the south shore scramble with egg whites. His ended up being mainly cheese and chicken. The portions were decent sized but they lacked substance and flavor. My hash browns were a tad greasy and sat very heavy in my stomach all day. Bacon was too crispy. The customer service was good though.   There's too many unique breakfast places in Vegas to go back to the Cracked Egg.   I'm giving it a solid 3 stars because it's a basic breakfast. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  I had heard so much hype about this place, I guess maybe I was expecting a little bit more.  But, I definitely was not disappointed.  Food is fresh, service is outstanding, and portions are huge.  They had lemon coffee cake the day i was there, and it was definitely worth getting instead of the toast.  I'm sure I'll be back there again."}
{"text":"Home from home, between my husband and I we probably visit 5 times per week. Food is always great, good down to earth fresh food with a twist!   The staff are wonderful too many to mention but everyone from Diana and Kevin the  wait staff to  Brandon at the front are always a joy. The kitchen staff have even seen me park the car and started my regular order. The only reason they re getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the attitude of the owner! The only person who greeted me surly when behind the front desk, and then I noticed he was curt with the staff. Other regulars noted it too! He was so unusual I checked who he was! With such wonderful staff, maybe you should take care of them!!!"}
{"text":"They need to serve water in a smaller glass . Food was cold by the time it came to me."}
{"text":"The green chile huevos rancheros is the best breakfast dish I've had in ages. Perfectly cooked and seasoned pork in a yummy sauce. The seasoned fried potatoes were also cooked perfectly and were not greasy at all. When the food is combined with a very attentive waitress, it equals a win!"}
{"text":"Just simply the best, hands down. Great servers and food. The skillets are my favorite meal and the coffee cake is insane, sooooo goood."}
{"text":"We walked in hungry and left full. Our server was on top of every need. The only negative is the pancakes  (go with the French toast and you won't leave disappointed). Overall nice diner feel with part of me wanting to update it just a bit. Biscuits are huge but a tad doey. The Mediterranean omelet was great and the options are a nice twist."}
{"text":"Juan is the best server here ! He is so attentive and courteously. He didn't lack or forget anything. He was awesome with the small talk. And his personality is charming. The rest of the staff should take notes. Oh and by the way the food was good but not better than Juan!!!"}
{"text":"Our first time here.  Great service and atmosphere!  Loved what my husband and I both ordered. We will definitely be return patrons."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area... 3 people at the desk when we walked in. The woman who greeted us was not exactly welcoming off friendly. Said hold on after asking us so how many? I'm like good morning to you too....  There was a cute brown haired girl that has just started... She helped buffer that abrasiveness and was smiling and asked us how our day was going. ... GOOD JOB GIRL! ... I told the front, I think your employee needs a tab bit of training in customer service... As this is summerlin and I just moved here and first impressions are everything! ..... Went and ate at the bar in back... Service was EXCELLeNT and the food was delicious!!!!!!   The MANAGER delivered our food and apologized... Well Played! Well Played! ...And we chatted for a bit. She's running a great Resturant!!!! I was very impressed with their quick response to my issue!!   Wonderful! And I'll definately be back!"}
{"text":"Great Food. Great Portions! Good service. It was a little packed so parking was a pain. No complaints otherwise"}
{"text":"Awesome food. They exceeded my expectations. Lisa was an exceptional server with a positive attitude. My coffee and water never saw the bottom of my cup. I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Try the coffee cake! Seriously it's the reason we come here. My girlfriend and I have been to this location a few times and have never been disappointed. We went on a Tuesday at 11 and, as you might imagine, it wasn't too busy. Service was fast our server was very nice and informative. However the reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because she was the only one who seemed like she wanted to be there. The host was on her phone more than she was helping guests or doing side work. The guy who, at first, I thought was a manager was sitting in a booth my entire meal talking to friends or family and also on his phone. Maybe he was on a break or something I don't presume to know exactly what's going on, however, perception is so important.  All in all, foods great, service is great the restaurant is clean. I'm happy and will be back"}
{"text":"Skip it .coffee was weak and tasteless ,How you can screw up a waffle I can't figure , but this was the worst waffle I ever had and it was undercooked , the fruit served with it was good, being that's all I ate. Eggs Benedict muffin undercooked . The service was fast and friendly ."}
{"text":"I had the chicken fried steak it was delicious, chocolate chip coffee cake moist definitely a repeat"}
{"text":"Always a great experience with the fam when we come here.  The service is always quick and friendly, and we love their coffee cake!  The prices are reasonable and the menu items are never disappointing."}
{"text":"I want to hate this location.  I have been a few times over the past year.  Been to The Cracked Egg (TCE) a few more times in the years prior to that.  I don't hate because of the food...more on that to come....I hate it for it's very location and arrangement.  Conflict.....How does this warrant a four star review?  It's because the food is consistently....awesome!  Depending on the hour of visit, you might have to wait.  Depending on your size of your party....you may have to wait for tables to be arranged.  Depending on the operational tempo of the staff...the frequency of visits by staff might suffer.  But the chow......always solid.  On my most recent visit, because I have been slow-carbing it since the beginning of the year, I opted for a few simple things.  I ordered up a water, avocado, and jalapeño bacon. There was some confusion as to who ordered up some coffee,  I figured I would take because I knew the coffee was good to go.  The avocado (1/2) slice was fresh and delicious.  The bacon....spicy and all that is bacon.  $10....with tip....whatever.  Not my first choice for breakfast.....certainly not my last...When I have to go as a group to TCE....I am game, but only if it's under my own optimal conditions."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was okay... you could tell the server judged me based off of my color. I hate when I walk into a place and people judge me before they even know who I am. It's truly hurtful. I am there to take my grandmother out to eat and I feel as though I am cut off or a burden to the establishment because people do not know how to talk to me. I don't like the cracked egg off of Charleston... the one off of Cheyenne is amazing and such a beautiful place. The energy is great and people love to do their job. Now at this one, everyone did their job but you could see they were not happy. It was like working in Mother's Day was a drag. By the end of the meal the server lightened up a bit. It was not enough to have my opinion changed. I think if I was to go to the cracked egg the one on Cheyenne is where I would go. The one on Charleston's does not know manners and how to excuses themselves when walking in front of someone. Did it blatantly and more than one time. Rushing and almost knocking my grandmothers purse on the floor. You can run an establishment without rushing. Customer service is everything."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious! My only complaint is that sometimes service can be slow or there's a long wait on weekends, but that tends to happen everywhere on weekends in Vegas. My first love is the Veggie Benny with bacon added, but I've tried many different entrees here and each have been so tasty and cooked perfectly. Also try the montecristo or the croissant French toast. They're both amazing!"}
{"text":"Being new to town I took the advice of a local and tried this place out for breakfast. My order was correct and brought to me quickly. This was true for both days that I ate here while in town. Just a little mom-and-pop joint, no Wi-Fi, no loud TVs, just a good family atmosphere."}
{"text":"As a local and frequent customer today is the last time we will go here.  Waitress was surly at best.  The attitude of employees EXCEPT the busboy, who was friendly, was bad.  To top it off the food was marginal.  No substitutions allowed period.  Every change to the order is an additional cost.  Upon trying to pay the bill their computer was down.  Several people were standing around waiting to leave and told it would be at least 10 more minutes.  NO discount was offered for inconvenience NOR were any of the customers thanked for coming as they left.  Terrible.   Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have eaten at several different locations including this one, today was quite disappointing. The \"seasoned\" potatoes had little to no seasoning whatsoever along with being cold, the eggs had a pool of grease laying on them and the toast was not buttered at all. There are a lot of breakfast places in town and I will be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Look... I eat here and I'm awesome. Enchilada omelet and the bacon cheese omelet have been my fav dishes. I even saw UFC guy CHuck Liddell here while I was eating. Sometimes there is a wait but that is a good thing at a breakfast joint.   THe outlet itself has been several different restaurants. I grew up in this hood and remember it changing all the time but the Cracked Egg has seemed to stick.   BUT PLEASE... throw a tv or 2 up on the wall. If I'm eating breakfast it means it's Sat or Sun morning and I'm missing some games..."}
{"text":"Cracked Egg is one of my favorite breakfast spots in Vegas. I will say this, I really enjoy the food but for the most part the servers usually suck. Since I work in the restaurant industry, I usually understand why service might suck one day or whatnot but I've had pretty crappy service there several times."}
{"text":"I am kind of neutral on this place. Came here at 7 am before a hike and it was pretty dead , which was nice! Previously when I came we had to wait a half hour so definitely come early if it's sat or sun. This time around I just ordered a two egg breakfast, but didn't realize that doesn't come with meat as a typical two egg breakfast does. Besides that disappointing factor my food was nothing special. It did come out fast and maybe I should try something more interesting next time but I just wasn't all that impressed with my meal. The service was fast and the waitress was friendly though."}
{"text":"No wonder this place was voted Best in Vegas! The breakfast was very yummy! If you do want something other then breakfast, their salads are huge!   The place gets pretty busy so expect a little bit of a wait.  If you go with the breakfast, here is a good tip get the coffee cake it is very good!"}
{"text":"The feel of this place is very homey. I really liked the staff. They are all really friendly. The food was delicious. I ordered the Eggs Benedict. Yummy. The kids meals are a good size. Coffee taste good. Our server was very attentive. But whenever he wasn't around, someone else was ready to help us. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Black Friday breakfast visit.First time ever. There was a small wait for a table because the place was BUSY!. Despite the reviews to the contrary, the staff was pleasant and attentive, without hovering. They asked if we wanted anything else before bringing the check and offered refills when our drinks were just less than half empty.  My friend ordered the Eggs Benny, which she said was good. The hash browns looked and were uncooked, but they were not greasy, so trade off. The eggs could have used slightly more hollandaise sauce, but our server was happy to bring more when asked.  I ordered the Monte Cristo on the servers rec. I was considering the Eggs benny also. It was good but nothing to write about, truly. I would have liked the option being offered, on menu, of jam or syrup. I choose the seasoned potatoes. They were so NOT seasoned. They were barely salted, but hey, not too greasy also. They were also not too crunchy or crispy, lol. But I did eat them, so they were tasty after adding salt and pepper. They just were not what I expected to receive based on the word \"Seasoned\"  Overall, I will go back and try other menu items. It was clean, the staff was pleasant and efficient, the food tasted good. The prices were reasonable. It is not close to my home, but for those in the area, check this place out if you haven't already.  Why wouldn't you?"}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg is not the business.   I found myself here for breakfast with a collegue with no real expectations as to what to expect. This is your run of the mill greasy spoon, common in the country's interior and you can tell that this is a locals favorite, for better or worse. They keep the restaurant very clean which is a plus and the service was friendly and warm.  The menu is extensive with all of the favorites well represented and after much consideration I decided to go light and try the Lowfat Scramble which combines Egg Whites scrambled with Chicken, Diced Green Chiles, Tortilla Chips and Salsa. The mouth feel of this dish is absolutely atrocious thanks to the soggy Tortilla Chips that they literally scramble with the rest of the ingredients. I had a hard time figuring out what was Chicken and what was Tortilla Chip until it was too late. Tortilla Chips should never be soggy, this you can trust.  This wins worst mouth feel award for 2014.     I may have ordered poorly and therefore would consider a repeat trip but for now I can only give 2 stars worth of bleh."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try this place out for breakfast. It was quite far from where we were staying in downtown, but still a pretty good place for breakfast. There was about a 10 minute wait, the place was pretty busy when we got there.   There were about 2 waitresses waiting on all tables. It took some time for someone to finally come to take our orders. We were waiting I'd say about 10 minutes or so. We decided to order specials that was on the board. Overall taste of food was pretty good. We had Daisy's Benie and one other type of special, which I can't remember at the moment. Both were fully loaded and there was so much food on the plate including some fried potatoes and we couldn't finish our dishes. Daisy's Benie was tasted like a Mexican type dis and was full of flavor. I would definitely eat here again, yet try something new."}
{"text":"Really sad, we walked in and immediately placed by the bathroom with 2 couples that had children. Meanwhile the main seating area was pretty empty. But it seems as an minority couple we were taken immediately to the back until we inquired about being seated away from the yelling babies. Our table was dirty we had to ask to clean the table. Don't think we will be coming back. Staff should treat patrons differently not like we are in the south. This is our second time here and we were placed in the back the first time also."}
{"text":"I eat at the cracked egg on cheyenne several times a week and have had an amazing experience.  My husband and I decided to eat at the green valley location on Friday, which we never do.   I ordered my 2 year old a meal off the kids menu, which consisted of one pancake, one sausage link & one egg.  My husband & I split the sausage link and we have both been sick since.  I have been nauseous since Friday & so has he.  We agreed it tasted undercooked & something was off about the taste.  I don't know if the meat is bad or if the chef does not know how to properly cook & prepare sausage.  So, we will not be going back.  We have not been the same since.  All I have to say is thank God our 2 year old didn't eat it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best standard American breakfast spot in las vegas. Egg white north shore scramble is my go to. Burgers and stuff are good too. Coffee cake is the star of the show! And u always run into Randy Couture at the counter!"}
{"text":"Full gluten free menu with lots to choose from~!  Workers there were all nice and pleasant. Food was all delicious; I had three dishes to try from bc I went with three of us."}
{"text":"*4.5 stars. I've been here a few times and the food is always good :D The coffee cake is soo yummy! Awesome vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Have not met a bad dish yet. Took my family for breakfast and they loved it. Wish we had one in Cali. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great place to grab breakfast.  I had come here with some friends as this is one of their go-to breakfast places in Vegas.  The portions are decent sized and filling.  I ordered the Veggie Benny (vegetarian eggs benedict) and it was good.  The place was pretty busy, so it seems to be a popular spot.  The prices are also reasonable.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Very consistently good breakfast. We usually hit up Cracked Egg the Sunday morning after a Sin City Rollergirls bout when I'm sore, stiff, dehydrated (not sure if it was from the bout or after party), and may or may not have have showered yet. Cracked Egg Veggie Omelet, seasoned potatoes, and sourdough toast are usually just what the doc ordered.  There's usually a bit of a wait but I don't think we've had to wait any longer than 10 minutes.  The waitresses are always friendly and I don't think they've ever made a mistake on our order.   The food isn't \"OMG SO GOOD\" but it's always tasty. The broccoli in my veggie omelet is always nice and great. Love the seasoned potatoes.   There's usually excellent people watching and clearly some folks who never actually made it home the night before."}
{"text":"Our Food was great and our Waitress was awesome!! She was very nice , prompt and pleasant the entire time !  They were very busy which was expected because it was a Sunday and we were told the wait was about 20 minutes or so. After waiting close to an hour our we noticed people that came in after us were getting seated already and we went up and asked how much longer and why others were being seated before us ? The hostess literally went ugh , we called your name at 12 o'clock and the funny thing is that it was literally 12 o'clock on the dot at that moment . When looking down we had noticed that about 6 other groups after us had already been seated. Not a huge deal other than the Hostess's horrible attitude and to top it off started arguing with us for no reason !   The good news was the other hostess stepped right in and took us to a table . We have been to the Cracked Egg on Green Valley at least 5 times or so and this was our first time to this location . We will go back .   Just a note is that some people create there own issues instead of just saying sorry and taking care of the customer. That's all people really want is to be helped and treated with Care !"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with the hubby, and the breakfast was horrible.  The slice of ham was thin & leathery to the point of being unable to cut into it.  The hash browns were dry and tasteless.  Even the toast was badly done, one dot of butter in the middle part of burnt & dry toast.  I'll give them credit for the eggs, and that's it."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Egg & I, Cracked Egg here, Cracked Egg there and all those places in between.  All have been a pleasant experience with exception to the last time a came to this location.  Upon entering the restaurant on a Sunday (My bad, but we were hungry) we were met not greeted by a frownie faced hostessed that addressed us like a herd of cattle.  No put on edge, I awaited to see what was going to happen next.  after a relatively short wait, we were taken to a table where all the scraps from the previous diners and been swept on to the bench I was about to sit on.  I waited to have it cleaned before I sat down.  We sat down to await our server and after several minutes I pulled out my phone and activated the stopwatch feature to see just how long this was going take.  Four minutes before someone other than our server got the drink orders.  When the drinks arrived they were followed by a shower of straws thrown down by the angry lady.  My Yelp senses start kicking in and I remained calm and went into surveillance mode.  The first thing I noticed was that not many employees seemed to be smiling.  The Sunday rush must really have taken it to them.  When we finally ordered from our waiter he was somewhat relaxed but had an edge to him that made me twitchy on a Sunday morning.  I ordered up Greek Scramble  and found to be much as it is at the other establishments....pretty good.  The negative energy in the air and curt demeanor in addition to my cup running empty with a refill not to be found caused my stomach to sour.  This is my last run on this restaurant even though Gary Oldman has supposedly dined there.  I have several crates of Costco eggs that I can make magic with at home.  I will prepare them many ways but with only one smile."}
{"text":"I really love this restaurant, their food is amazing! I always have the cracked croissant and a side of coffee cake, and they're delicious. I've had their biscuit with gravy and it is by far the best side I've had in awhile. I'm a big fan of breakfast joints and think this one is by far one of the  best I have been too in a very long time. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of breakfast food. The Cracked Egg is one of the better breakfast restaurants that I've gone to so far in Las Vegas because it comes very close to the typical diner breakfast that I grew up on in New Jersey.  I had the Veggie Skillet with toast and their coffee cake. First off, a big wow on that coffee cake-light and sweet and not heavy at all.  Veggie skillet was packed with all of the ingredients- mushroom, peppers, tomatoes, spinach and potatoes. Veggies were almost perfectly cooked, maybe first few bites of the spinach was not cooked enough, but overall it was very enjoyable and filling. The potatoes were spot on. Service was very good. Lisa, my server, was attentive and kept checking in on me- caused me getting an extra of toast."}
{"text":"All I can say is, Yum! This breakfast/brunch spot is a great place to eat in Las Vegas. It's located right across a busy plaza but don't let that fool you, this place can get packed.  My S/O and I arrived around 11:30 and waited only about 15 minutes. Our waitress came by shortly and were handed a menu. There are no pictures just words on a double sided laminated paper. I ended up ordering the Eggs Benedict Olé thay came with hashbrowns while my S/O ordered a giant omelet that came with potatoes and coffee cake.  The portions were huge and the food delish! I love perfect eggs (lol) and this place sure satisfied by liking. My S/O finished his omelet but passed on the potatoes. The coffee cake you may ask? It was so so soooo good.  I have never tried coffee cake before but it was great! It didn't taste like coffee (so not sure where the name comes from) and was filled with custard! My S/O isn't a fan of custard so I happily scooped the plate clean.   So why 4 stars? Well, after ordering our food and watching people that came after us receive their food, we were starting to wonder if they forgot about us. Other than that, friendly staff and awesome food. Will definitely come back again should there by a chance I'll be able to."}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast spot, they have some really good chorizo and potatoes, and omelets. Also their coffee cake is so fresh and fluffy. Service is great but it gets super packed on weekends so maybe call ahead of time to see how long the wait is. Other than that great place to eat especially for breakfast."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, good atmosphere. Staff is really nice. Get the coffee cake - apple flavor is best omg it's amazing! So soft and fluffy!"}
{"text":"I've gone to every location and they are equally as great. I love the food and the service! Any time I have family in town, this is where I take them! I love the stuffed French toast and their eggs benedict. I can never decide which one to get so I always get the stuffed French toast with half an order of eggs benedict. They always have great customer service and their coffee cake is to die for. It's so moist and different I can't explain it, just delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great food, attentive servers, great vibe.  I totally recommend this place! I have been here 4 times on 3 different visits to Vegas and it has been so consistently lovely I decided to write a review.  Thanks, Cracked Egg!  Oh, and the stuffed french toasts are divine."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast here.  The eggs were perfect, the waiter was fast and friendly and our coffee cups were never empty.  The atmosphere is pretty thin - if you want a more comfy feel to your restaurant this is not it. If you are good with a simple and very clean place to eat with great food, you will be happy here."}
{"text":"We went this morning for breakfast . I got a ham and cheese omelet, seasoned potatoes, and a coffee cake. My wife got one of the specials , 1 pancake, 1 bacon, 1 sausage, 1 egg. My omelet was great, along with the potatoes and cake. Her panc as ke was rubbery, but had a good flavor. Overall, not the quality we expected from them."}
{"text":"When we first arrived in Vegas, we visited The Cracked Egg on Rainbow. It was okay but nothing special. So when we found ourselves in Henderson during breakfast time and with a coupon, we decided to try it again.  It was about 1pm on Saturday and the place was mostly empty. Not a red flag really because the recession is killing the restaurant business. Service was pretty quick - sat down, ordered drinks from the helper, the waiter was so fast that I had to ask for a couple more minutes, and he came back in a couple of minutes. All was going well until I ordered. Club Sandwich - no ham, no mayo, bacon crispy, 1000 island dressing on the side - and fries. \"Sorry, we ran out of fries.\" What???? No fries???? Big red flag - obviously the fries are not made fresh. But, you may be thinking, perhaps they just ran out of potatoes. Possible, yes, but they still had the breakfast potatoes that were served with my husband's meal. So, I am really not happy about this situation. Not because of there being no fries as much as them not being made fresh. I mean, seriously, In-N-Out makes fries - from real potatoes - all day long. However, I did regroup and try to enjoy my lunch.  As I said, I had the Club Sandwich. It was good - came with avocado and cheese which is a huge bonus for me and not always included. Unfortunately, it was nothing special. And, believe it or not, it was too big for my mouth so I had to cut it up.   My husband had a Sausage Scramble which was not actually scrambled together but layered. He said it was quite nice (that is like 4 stars in ratings talk). And, his coffee was getting refilled promptly AND they gave him more creamers than he could use. So, overall, great meal for the hubby.  I have seen some of the other reviews raving about the breakfast items and perhaps that is where I went wrong. If we go again (which we probably will since I have another coupon), I am thinking I will try the Banana Chocolate Chip Pancakes. I will let you know."}
{"text":"Been living here for 3 months and finally tried this place with my mom. Waited as long as the hostess said - 15 minutes. It's definitely a well known place for breakfast because of how busy it was. It was a fast pace restaurant, got our food within 15 minutes after ordering. I will definitely be back. A good portion of food for 1 person. :)"}
{"text":"We have been here several times since moving to Henderson. It's always been pretty good which is why we went back. After yesterday, we will never go back. There are so many food options in Vegas and Henderson that to be treated with poor service, I'd rather spend my money elsewhere.   It started from the moment we walked in. For some reason the hostess had an attitude, barely said two words to us, walked us to the table, put our menus on the table without a word, and walked away. Then it took about 10 min before anyone came up. Mind you this was 1:15 on Friday. By no means busy. We were ready to order, and I told the waitress we were in a hurry because we were on a lunch break. I ordered the Monte Cristo which clearly states on the menu comes with hash browns or home fried potatoes, something like that. When I order, she says do you want French fries. Threw me off because that wasn't a choice. Then the coffee cake was burnt on the bottom. Why would you even serve that. That's always been my favorite thing there. We ate the top but it just wasn't as good. You could clearly tell there was a problem with it and she never asked about it the entire time we were there. In fact, she left the plate with all its burnt crumbs on our table the the entire meal. It's like she wanted us to be taunted by it.   Then the food came about a good 15 min later. We are starting to panic by this point because we have to get back to work. There is no way all of this should have taken closer to an hour. I have a deep fried sandwich for crying out loud. I swear she put our food in late. We know that doesn't take that long. When the food comes, I ask for the check right away, and my daughter asks for ranch. She's brings the check but we never see the ranch nor do we see her again. Not once. I had to ask a bus boy for a container for the rest of my sandwich. Which by the way the sandwich was burnt as well. Very crispy.  You have to pay up front. The person up there asks how it was, and I said \"not good\". She either is inexperienced on how to handle that response or she just didn't care. All I heard in response was her mumbling under her breath \"oh sorry to hear that\" as she's facing the cash register ringing me out. That's it. We'll take our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Peanut Butter French Toast was Superb!"}
{"text":"Medium wait, fast hot coffee, good food....what can you say, it's breakfast for the champions. The Greek Omlette, French Toast and short stack all received thumbs up."}
{"text":"Would have given it 5stars but, it wasn't a place I need to return to tomorrow. I read all the other reviews before we went in. My husband and I went for breakfast on Sunday. We had a 20 minute wait. The staff was friendly enough, nothing to exceed customer service standards, but met my expectations.(keep in mind I've been the Gm at a national chain restaurant for 10 years). The server greeted us after being seated for 4 minutes. We gave our beverage and food order. Two coffees, 2waters, chille Verde rancheros/seasoned potatoes, big bad wolf omelette w/hashbrowns & SD toast. Drinks came quickly. Coffee tasted like coffee, after all its not a \"coffee shop\". Server came by the table 3 times to warm up our coffee before we received our food. Our order took 22 minutes to reach our table. Acceptable, considering the restaurant volume and the fact that we had ordered\"specialty items\", as opposed to eggs & toast. My chille  Verde rancheros was AMAZING! The pork was tender and juicy, the sauce had excellent flavor. I will be returning for this dish. My husband was hesitant about the omelette due to yelpers reviews. He went for it. The big bad wolf omelette was delicious. It was thoroughly cooked not dry.  I'll be back, I want to try the country Benedict."}
{"text":"Amazing homemade food! Best place to come in for breakfast in Vegas!! You will be back for more, I know I will!! Friendly staff and great way to start your day. Highly recommend! Thank you for the great food :))) happy customer"}
{"text":"Food was good very busy on weekends had a 15min wait the service was nice friendly environment"}
{"text":"Best home-cooked breakfast in the neighborhood, and a welcome new addition to this corner of the city."}
{"text":"The breakfasts are huge! I recommend the biscuits and gravy, half order is plenty. Interestingly enough they have Greek Food and it is also amazing. Loved the Gyro platter. I predict this place will need more seating ASAP as it's also super affordable."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant! It is always packed, and the staff is SO accommodating! They have seating up front for those waiting to be seated, and a fair amount of space outside if you want to wait outside. Generally, the wait time is super quick though.   The food always comes out really fast, and is always good. The coffee cake is a must, and so is the fresh squeezed orange juice! All the wait staff is pleasant, which is so nice.   This restaurant is one of my favorites in town. :)"}
{"text":"I like this place for late breakfasts in Las Vegas but they are just open until 2pm. I ordered Joe's scrambled and it was awesome. Service lady wad very nice. I'll come back."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I called well in advance to ask if I could bring my dog and I was told yes! Then the bitch ass old white lady basically yelled at us to tell us no dogs. WHILE I HAVE MY REGISTERED EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL!!"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch! I'm picky when it comes to benedicts.  I had the country Benny and it hsd perfectly poached eggs on top. The gravy was thick as it should be. The hash browns were not dry like most places I've been to. The coffee cake was a pumpkin cake. My husband had the Monte Cristo and it was also delicious and the cheese all nice and melted.  Our server Cynthia was super nice and attentive  =) will definitely be coming here again"}
{"text":"Friendly staff ; prompt and excellent service. Great twists on some breakfast staples.  Try the Corn Beef Hash. Hash brown game is on point"}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg is does NOT honor Veterans and does NOT celebrate Veterans Day. Brought my WWII dad here for breakfast on Veterans Day. He was disappointed as was I. Unfortunately never again. Food is ok.  Edited to add: I emailed the owners to say I was really surprised that they chose not to celebrate our  country's heroes and they never responded or even acknowledged the issue. Poor form. Definite fail."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast with Andi as our server. The orange cream coffee cake was to die for, and our entrees arrived very quickly. All of the food was served hot. I was very, very happy with our meal there this morning.  Andi was truly sweet, kind and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is very near to several other places I do business. So when I saw featured in a \"breakfast\" edition of Las Vegas Weekly, I made sure to stop in.  The strong suit of this venue is the creativity of its menu. There were no less than seven versions of Eggs Benedict, for example. Pastrami Benedict, Mexican Benedict, Veggie Benedict with Avacado, et. al. The entire menu was extremely diverse for a breakfast joint. There's a lunch/sandwich menu as well.  After that, much credit for customer service. Twice, the BUSBOY stopped to offer refills on my coffee.  My selections were tasty enough. Said another way, the food was of good quality. Not \"rock my world\" quality, but well above-average.  I think this place best fits, for me, as a morning-after breakfast nook with a lady friend. Solo, I'm still heading for Omelet House, where there are also many choices (though not quite as diverse as here), but the portions are much larger, for about the same price."}
{"text":"Hands down top two fav breakfast place in LAS VEGAS.. \"Lighten up\" is my favorite go to healthy breakfast plate. Everything is good:))) Service is always warm and welcoming.."}
{"text":"I was disappointed that your restaurant didn't offer a military discount especially since we came in to eat on Veterans Day, and so many other places support our troops from past and present."}
{"text":"What can I say other than I love the French toast. It always hits the spot and this place is always packed."}
{"text":"Not the best. Order oatmeal.  Apparently they have 2 different kinds of oatmeal here.  Overloaded Oatmeal and a small oatmeal.  They are not the same.  I order the small thinking it was the same just a smaller portion.  When I asked for nuts and berries she said it wasn't an option with the small.  It's wasn't that good of oatmeal and should have returned it.  Coffee was horrible. Been sitting on the burner for way to long."}
{"text":"The food here was light and tasty. It was notably better than Egg Works."}
{"text":"Amazing Experience! We were driving by looking for a place to eat breakfast and found this place so we thought we would try it. My family was sooo impressed. Service was fast. The food was delish! And service was awesome. My youngest son even said that \"it was the best breakfast he had ever had\"! We went back the next day and although it was busier that day, the service & food were the same....GREAT! What a great find!! When we come to Vegas, we will always come by this spot. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I love this little gem. The breakfast menu is so good. I love all the choices and imagination here. So many places do a same ole same ole approach to the most important meal of the day, but the folks at the Cracked Egg start the day off right with fresh made coffee cake and Delicious dished that will elate your palate.   I love you Cracked egg. Now gimme a little of that sugar."}
{"text":"Nice menu with lots of unique options. Breakfast is so good. I love the variety of coffee cakes (they make them fresh every morning).   They have a bunch of really good salads too.   I have yet to have anything ordinary or so so at the cracked egg."}
{"text":"Huge portions, and delicious food. The wait is a little long on busy mornings, but this place definitely makes my day whenever I visit this side of town to pick veggies and fruits at our local orchard. I love their daily specials, there's always something good to try."}
{"text":"Great food, good service. The \"Veggie Benny\" was delicious! (Only complaint- the waitress forgot to bring us more coffee)."}
{"text":"| I take my cream and sugar with a hint of coffee! | Coffee is always fresh. Orange Juice is always fresh. Took on the chocolate banana pancakes and my partnah in crime had the sausage, crispy hash brown , and over easy eggs. Add the coffee cake and pow... It's a power breakfast! Everything was superb. I love this joint!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast joint. I give it 3.5 stars. I always ask myself \"is this better overall than IHOP/Denny's\"....answer is nope. It's good quality but nothing crazy special.  The omelets are good but wished they are bigger. I usually leave a little hungry.  But have never had anything bad.  It's close to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place!   Really good breakfast food at a good price. Very clean. The staff is always friendly and attentive.   Hint: If you sign up for their mailing list, they will send you $8 off your bill coupons!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee cake, like to die for!! Tortilla soup was a major hit! Great experience for first day in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best little kept secret in Las Vegas thus far...... Food and Service was fabulous !!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. The customer service is consistent and their coffee cake is to die for. I always get a piece. Plus their decor is really nice and homey which is a plus for me. Expect a little wait on the weekends because they're usually busy but I've never waited more that 15-20 minutes."}
{"text":"Darn. We walked here from Green Valley Ranch spa and had to cross a highway to get here. The Cracked Egg is located in a big strip mall next to a supermarket, and has ample parking. The ambience is a bit lacking, but the place was packed. Overall, the food was disappointing for having 4 stars on Yelp. The coffee cake was interesting but not out of this world, and the hash browns were underseasoned, undersalted, and undercooked. It's hard to screw up eggs, and yet this meal was terrible overall. Disappointed after all the hype seen in previous reviews."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Stopped in for breakfast after a big night out. This is the perfect hangover spot.  Service is good, fast.  I ordered a Big Bad Wolfe omelette and got the home fries. Instead of toast opt for the Coffee Cake because it's warm, and freaking delicious.   Glad I live in the area because this is going to be a regular spot for me. Lots of breakfast and lunch options.  Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"I don't typically write reviews (ever) but I must say the Cracked Egg made an irretrievable impression. Not being from the area and staying at place a little far from Vegas (good ol Henderson) led me to this spot. Immediate attention and greets as soon as I walked in through the door. For a Saturday morning this place wasn't all that busy and we were seated within a few seconds LITERALLY seconds of walking in. The staff were all really polite, friendly and seemed to genuinely care about our experience.  Now let's talk about the food. From their Chili and cheese omelette, pumpkin white chocolate coffee cake to their chimichangas! (I didn't actually order all this food, picked off my bfs plate ;)) It was all great! Delicious. I almost wanted to try another savory cake to go. (Watching the carbs) And on our way out a huge basket filled with complimentary chocolate mints! Definitely recommend if you're in the area or don't want to pay an arm and a leg for a breakfast in Vegas which isn't allll that far. :)"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Just what the Doc ordered after a full night on the strip with 3 hours of sleep! Great food and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"So babycakes had an hour wait, so we ended up here for breakfast.  Not a bad 2nd option at all!  Service was friendly and food was greasy fantastic!  I didn't sample the other peoples food, but what I got was enough to leave a greasy happy grin on my face.  mmmmmm *dreamy food coma  - Coffee Cake - This came out warm, fluffy and super sweet.  Good for a hungry girl to scarf almost all of it down  Then came.... - Cracked Egg Croissant - I had all the components that my texture whore self loves!  Melty cheese, gooey egg yolk, crispy BACON!, flaky AND toasty croissant.  The side of crispy nuggets of seasoned potato cubes rounded it out.  Conclusion:  If you can't wait for the red velvet pancakes up the street, Cracked Egg is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast spot when I visit Vegas ! Came on a Saturday morning , service was great and my meal was so good ! I had the Scrambled Eggs with Pesto spinach and feta cheese and it was delicious !! Also their side of potatoes were so amazing , ate every one !!"}
{"text":"Plan for a wait on the weekends but it goes fast. The outside patio is nice if the weather is good. Food is typical breakfast eats but done well. My favorite is the corned beef hash - real corned beef and hashbrowns. I add the chorizo for some spice. Coffee cake is amazing, as are the seasoned potatoes.  Updated 7/5. By the way, after finally trying out a dish that was labelled similarly at its competition \"The Egg and I\", I was sorely disappointed in their version. Way to win the battle of the breakfast!"}
{"text":"Food was ok today when my family and I went for breakfast! The waitress was rude and slow as hell! She was too busy socializing with the wife or girlfriend of one of the managers instead of helping us. My coffee cake was cold while my husbands was hot. My sons scrambled eggs weren't even cooked all the way. Won't be going back here"}
{"text":"Being a big fan of breakfast, more-so of eggs I drove across town and sat down to a late breakfast. Although there were people waiting I was promptly seated as I was only a party of one.   As far as the food is concerned, their hashbrowns are lightly browned, not overcooked. Their eggs were to order and seasoned in the right fashion.   A few notable items on their menu is the monte cristo which is a battered sandwich with cheese and ham. The eggs benedict's are a sure heart attack full of flavor waiting to be savored. Egg sandwiches, biscuits and gravy and specialty pancakes are also a must here.  If your feeling for something light, the fresh fruit is very fresh and ripe for the asking.  This place also does lunch serving breakfast and lunchtime sandwiches."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food.  I sat at the counter with a friend, we had steak and eggs.  The breakfast was fantastic, with super attention. I will return, as well as recommend."}
{"text":"Delish breakfast! Awesome service! Good coffee and overall food is served in big portions and substitutes are always an option.  Caters to non meat eaters too!"}
{"text":"I really loved the omelette I order. I believe it was called the GVP... it was a big portion and they gave me fruit because I didn't want the toast or potatoes. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Easy and safe choice for breakfast!   The Cracked Egg has continued to serve great food with good service.  They usually have a continuous stream of customers.  Even with that, your wait time is short.    The Pesto Scramble has quickly become my usual order.  They have the perfect amount of pesto with diced chicken, spinach and feta sprinkled on top.  The seasoned potatoes are a great accompaniment.  Yummy.  You have your choice of toast or coffee cake.  I always get the homemade coffee cake.  It changes everyday and would highly recommend getting this.    Service can be a little spotty but I'm guessing it's how busy they are.  It's not bad though and won't hold that against them.    Stop in a check them out! I'm always happy to dine here."}
{"text":"First time ordering the eggs Benedict and I hated it. The eggs were runny and whatever English muffin brand they used was flat.  The holindase sauce had to have been from a powdered mix not made fresh.   To top it all off the waitress Cynthia was horrible.  She was so unattentive, horrible service today.  It will be awhile before I go back."}
{"text":"Very basic breakfast, service at this place is horrible,,,do not sit outside, been there twice and same horrible service both times, coffee empty, bussers walking by not helping out.  I had to go to the host to get some attention to the table.  You can certainly do better than this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Overpriced, loud acoustics, Crowded and just average. Had a breakfast skillet."}
{"text":"I can't believe after living 2 exits away for a year and half we only just tried this gem this weekend?! My husband and I have tried so many breakfast spots in LV and this one lives up to what others have told me about it. Decently priced food, you can add on 1 or 2 pancakes rather than a full order (glad someone caught on) and food service was quick (which my husband likes). I got the northern scramble (I think was the name) and my hubs got the carnitas one, 2 coffees, and pancakes all under $35. Good deal. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've had breakfast at The Cracked Egg on multiple occasions and nothing in that restaurant warrants the, at times, outrageous wait. On my latest visit I had The Garden Patch Omelet which had broccoli, spinach, mushrooms, tomato, and cheese. The omelet was around $10 and came out very dry, almost inedible if it wasn't for the pounds of melted cheese on top. The veggies on the inside were mushy and indistinguishable. The side of hash browns was okay, as was the toast... but a hefty price to pay for some toast and small side of hash browns. I picked at my omelet, and left over half of it un eaten. My previous visits here were equally unmemorable, but I got to catch up with lovely Jaime W here, so I opted to give this place another shot. I think this will be my last visit to The Cracked Egg though."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place, remember there is only so much that you can do with eggs, toast, and bacon but what can be done is done well at the Cracked Egg!!  The place is always busy but they get everybody in and out pretty fast without anybody feeling rushed, matter of fact, I was really impressed with how many of the servers took to to stop and talk with the regulars that they knew.  The Sin City Skillets are all very tasty and very filling, the French Toast is very fresh and sweet, and the Hash Browns (which is a breakfast staple for me) were perfect.  The menu is large, there is something for everybody and when you are at the Cracked Egg you just kinda feel at home.  Until next time Yelpers ........................ Be Local, Live Local, and whenever you can, Buy Local!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Most of the time I rate a restaurant only by the food, because that is what I am there for. Not that service is not imporatant, but so often rates from pretty good to very good no matter where. I cannot say the same for this particualar location however. I have been there a few times for breakfast, and while the food never dissapoints, the service does. It is unlikely I would never serve a server, but this was the first place a few months ago the made me do exactly that. Not indifferent servce, downright rude service. Went there on Saturday (4th) for breakfast with my wife. As we walked in, we were instantly greetes with a dour faced blonde who blurted out,,,2? Nice. Would it be too much to say welcome, or smile, or good morning, or anything, besides 2? As we sat close to the door, I watched virtually the same 'greeting' for everyone that walked in. I saw a male employee arrive by the front door. He didn't get even so much as a \"1?\". There just seems to be a culture of unhappiness or something here. And it was not like our server seemed to offer much more.Cheer up people. Is it really so bad having a job there?"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite breakfast spot. The food is always good no matter what I order. The coffee cake and coffee is on point!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast hand down, service is great and they have great offer for repeated guests. If you haven't been there you better start going, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I got the country beni - basically a cross between eggs benedict and biscuits and gravy.  What a great idea!  I thought the poached eggs were done just perfect, the sausage had a nice spice to it, and the gravy was just right - not too salty.  the only complaint I have is that the biscuit was a bit chewy, it could have been more crumbly...maybe just over mixed.  I would totally go here again!!"}
{"text":"I have always believed that if you make good coffee everything else will be just fine. I never ate at this place before but I would definitely look them up for a return visit this place was fantastic on their food, the amount of food and pricing was all well worth the visit and I give them five stars for a job well done"}
{"text":"We went here a few days ago for lunch. The food was very good. I got coffee, grapefruit juice, and a turkey wrap with potatoes on the side. I ate every bite. My mom was not impressed. She said the food was too expensive and not good enough for the price. The outside of the restaurant makes you think you should dress super nice to eat there, but when you walk in, it kinda reminded me of a little deli. It had simple booths, not so many decorations, and it just wasn't fancy. Simple, but good. I will go back again for the food."}
{"text":"Absolutely yummy!! They make the best red velvet coffee cake!! Also the house potatoes were so crunchy and flavored perfect. Friendly staff and cool atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Having lunch with my boyfriend here for the first time and Cory our waitress, gave us great customer service. We received our food very quickly and it turned out delicious. I definitely recommend this place to friends and family.  :)"}
{"text":"Love their breakfast food. My boyfriend always orders the South Shore Scramble, I'm a sucker for their blueberry pancakes. They also serve the most delicious coffee cakes!   Not sure if we ever ordered anything that wasn't good on their menu...  Great place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Clean place, super service (thank you, Penny!), enormous quantities of tasty food. Love the new look and menu. Close to home so we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Didn't have to wait long to be seated, our waitress was wonderful, and the breakfast came in a great time frame. My meal, as well as my husband's meal, were so tasty. Everything was delicious. I definitely plan to return soon."}
{"text":"Where do i begin. This used to be, bar none my favorite breakfast place in town, living a couple of miles away i have eaten here over a hundred times between 2006 and 2010 but then two things happened for me 1) the prices got ridiculously high while the portions got smaller and 2) the quality of the food has changed or they started using inferior ingrediants because i get nauseous about a half hour after eating there each time now which is highly unusual for me. This has been the case several times, like four, so i give up and drive up to trop n jones for some awesome breakfast at the black bear."}
{"text":"The staff is always amazing. I always feel welcomed like I'm family. My complicated order us always perfect  (I'm not easy) and the food is ALWAYS on point. If you haven't had the coffee cake..GO NOW!"}
{"text":"VERONICA was an outstanding waitress, attentive and engaging.  She clarified my order actually helping me pick something better and more to my preference. Sit in her section she will take great care of you! Food ok , not very flavorful. my husband likes this place I am in search of a better place. Was served a BLT style sandwich, the bacon wasn't freshly cooked, guacamole bland, turkey couldn't even taste it, criossant soggy, way too much lettuce excessive amount seriously could have made a side salad out of it. Seasoned shoe strings fries outstanding, I never have liked shoestring fries, so this was a delightful first. Biscuits and gravy lacking flavor. I prefer Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome.  I have eaten omelets, skillets and chile verde.  Everything has been delicious.  The service is unpredictable.  The hostess is always frazzled and irritable but the servers are usually okay.  It always seems like the service is just so slow.  Getting the check takes forever and then waiting to pay takes even longer.  The food is good enough for this not to bother me too much."}
{"text":"There are lots of great brunch places in Vegas, and this is one of the best. The specials are always tasty and generously portioned, and I really enjoy the breakfast skillet with sweet potatoes and hash browns. Some of the daily coffee cakes are delicious, and some are just okay, but I love that it's a different flavor every time I come in. The clam chowder isn't my favorite. Service at the counter is always fast, friendly, and accurate, even when it's busy."}
{"text":"You never know what the coffee cake will be but it's always a winner!  From one hour to the next it might be the apple, cherry, chocolate chip, etc. Always served nice and hot."}
{"text":"Been here twice before and liked the food, the customer service was ok not the best. This morning was the worst customer service that we experienced, the waitress was pretty much ignoring us and helping the tables around us  not once did she come by. After waiting for a while without being acknowledged we decided to leave. At any establishment it's more than just the food but also the customer service they go hand in hand. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I must say if I could eat breakfast here everyday I would.  The ingredients are always fresh and the service is attention and quick."}
{"text":"Father's Day brunch! Best place around! Now time to expand. Rent the place next door!"}
{"text":"We're visiting from LA and we decided to try this place. Glad we did, food and service was great! Staff was really friendly! We had the farmers skillet and banana nut pancakes they are to die for! We will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Eggcellent!! I've been trying to earn my Breakfast Club badge since FOREVER so naturally The Cracked Egg has been in my morning rotation. Nothing too fancy just your typical breakfast and brunch fare. Humble and welcoming vibe. No judgement if you show up in your pjs (not that I ever would) but nice to know it doesn't really matter here. And even though the line looks long, you'll never have to wait longer than 20 minutes to be seated.   I'm a creature of habit, so I prefer the omelettes and sub. with egg whites. The go-to, The Californian (of course). Anything topped with avocado and bacon is alright in my book. The green omelette is a must try as well. Not a huge fan of the coffee cake (hard pass) mostly because I don't like sweets at breakfast. I want savory. And a cup of coffee too so keep it comin'.  ;)"}
{"text":"I am writing this review based on one visit, so maybe it was a good day for them, but, wow, what a great breakfast! Best I've ever had in a restaurant actually. Honestly. Here's the deal: I have loved Monte Cristo sandwiches since I was a kid, not that I eat them much, but when I do I really enjoy them. For those who don't know, a Monte Cristo is a turkey, ham, and swiss on french toast, fried so the cheese is melted. The Cracked Egg's version is battered and then deep fried. It is so rich and sinful, but, my god, it is delicious. The bacon on the side was also excellent and cooked to perfection. My wife had scrambled eggs, sausage links and toast, all excellent. It's a bit pricey for a breakfast place, but you definitely get what you pay for. Highly recommend. This was the Cheyenne location, I have no idea how the others are."}
{"text":"I know lots of people that rave about this place and I frankly don't get what the big fuss is about!  Food was overpriced and mediocre at best.  I've been to other places that had much better food and cost less."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 15 years. Best breakfast food in Las Vegas. I'm a local and wouldn't go anywhere else. Friendly staff and the waitresses always remember what I order."}
{"text":"delicious breakfast as always... one of the best breakfast spots in green valley.  the wait on the weekends seems to be long sometimes but its worth it."}
{"text":"Fabulous gluten free items. The best breakfast place in town and its local. The service is quick best poached eggs!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place in Nevada. Fruit plate is fab! Sometimes you just don't know when it comes to fruit"}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst restaurant in Henderson  Living here for 25 years and there is a reason I was never here before  Eggs cold  Bagel cold  Tomato's rotten  Coffee good  Please go to sunrise cafe instead"}
{"text":"Yumm! Breakfast, my favorite meal of the day. There's a reason why this place is always so crowded, it's delicious!!   Very similar to The Egg & I down to the seasoned potatoes and hustle & bustle. The noise level is very loud, it's what you'd expect of the breakfast/brunch crowd. So if you're looking for a nice quiet breakfast this place isn't for you. In case the line to be seated is longer than expected, look for the tiny bench midway between the restaurant along the kitchen. If it's a particularly chilly morning, try to grab a seat there while you wait. It'll give you time to check out the daily specials menu board.   Many options on the menu. The Californian with egg whites always hits the spot. I'd pass on the coffee cake though, it's more like a square piece of cake with frosting drizzled over the top. Sadly, it didn't taste like coffee cake at all, boo. Good prices but the service can be hit or miss. All in all, when you're feeling too lazy to make it yourself come here for some good ol' comfort food."}
{"text":"Food is decent, services is horrible,  I run out of coffee and one lady passed  by and ignored us completely and did not ask us if we needed more coffee"}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg recently opened in Summerlin. There was a line out the door the morning we were there. The food was serviceable, but no dish stood out as something special. I had the low fat special. Which had chicken, green chilies, red salsa and tortilla chips. It tasted okay but did not look very appetizing on the plate.  It looked like a pinkish mash. The tortilla chips were also mushy. It seemed like they were trying to make a healthier version of chilaquiles, but the execution was so so. Still, it was eatable. My husband had the carnitas omelette which was fine. Our friends two of the skillets and the eggs Benedict. All of which were also fine. The best part of the meal was the coffee cake that they offer as a side. It's served warm with a sugar glaze on top. This place is an okay breakfast option if your favorite place is too packed. I think the wait that we experienced was because this is a new place. The crowds will die down after it's been open a while."}
{"text":"I've stopped by to have breakfast here for over a year now and I love what the next generation owners have done with the place! It's always been a great spot, but the new coffee and changes to the food are amazing! Definitely one of my all time favorite breakfast stops in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"went to The Cracked Egg while I was in Las Vegas first off the restaurant was hot you couldn't stand it our water glasses would only get filled half full and then we ended up with ants all over our table and are seat no review it was horrible"}
{"text":"Great Customer Service our waitress was very attentive, Food was delicious. By the way, biscuits are huge and very fresh..Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Been here twice always a great experience. We've gotten lucky both times with wait times, we've been seated quickly. Food is always good and staff is very nice. Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Went here wanting to enjoy a nice breakfast outside in this beautiful weather...got here and got seated right away since we wanted outside, even said we had my puppy with us. Gave us a choice of tables and sent out the server. Got out order put in only for the host to come back out and tell us that we couldn't have out puppy on the patio area...really? Why not say this right at the beginning and not after you sat us and we put our order in??!!  It giving this place another thought!!"}
{"text":"Just came from eating at our favorite local breakfast place and as usual, very pleased with the quality of the food and the service.  I had a GVP omelet with fruit and hubby had ham and eggs.  Very generous servings.  This is a kid friendly restaurant and an excellent place to take out-of-town guests and a great place to meet up with friends and family."}
{"text":"The food is good...but for the price you pay for the eggs....don't you think you could dust the lamps above the table and the counters with decor have tons of dust and above the ceiling fans too."}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot for when you're leaving  Vegas. I had the eggs Benedict. It was amazing. Be sure to try the coffee cake."}
{"text":"Had the Tropical French Toast today. It was HUGE! No way I could even eat half of it. Highly suggest sharing. I wonder of they offer half portions.... But it was tasty. Loaded with toasted coconut, and a sliced whole banana."}
{"text":"Juevos rancheros and Denver omelette. Juevos rancheros was pretty good. Omelette was just ok. Cheese was on top which is weird. I prefer it in the middle. Veggies were cooked into the egg, which is also weird. It was meh. Seasoned potatoes were ok. Coffee was kept full. Service was good."}
{"text":"Breakfast was very good.   Gluten free pancakes were delicious.     Service was fast and efficient.    Hostess Alexis I was very friendly and attentive.    Great place for breakfast"}
{"text":"Found The Cracked Egg-on Yelp! So glad we tried it! Great food and service!   Ashley could not have been sweeter and the owner was so nice to stop at our table to Tell us about his restaurant! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh food here is great. They have the best orange juice in the world lol!  Service is good. It's busy on weekends but the wait for a small party is not too bad. I had the chicken fried steak and eggs, it was delicious.. That orange though gave me life! Def coming back to pig out some more:)"}
{"text":"Oh breakfast, oh breakfast! One of the best places to get breakfast! If you are looking for a menu that shows its creativity with eggs, well here it is. I have been here a few times and am never disappointed! The service is great and quick! Like others have said, you must try the coffee cake bread. They switch up the flavors, today was blueberry! YUM! Go there hungry and leave satisfied!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff as soon as you walk thru the door from the host to the waiters. Food was delicious and very timely. Corned beef hash was amazing."}
{"text":"Breakfast. Need I say more?   The wait was minimal for a weekend but the place was busy.  The food arrived quickly.   Now for the food - it was you typical breakfast place. Nothing outstanding. Just good food. I was happy to get rye bread for toast. My SIL got the coffee Cake and was surprised that it was essentially a piece of red velvet cake with a coffee cake icing. It tasted good but one couldn't eat much of it.   If you need a quick breakfast where you will be served quickly and the food will be a solid good, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Solid.  I love breakfast, so I liked this place.  Good coffee cake, excellent skillet breakfast.  Good service and nice atmosphere.  I like the sign that says \"Unattended children will be given an espresso and a puppy\".  :)"}
{"text":"This place was crackin' on a Saturday around 11 AM, but we managed to sit at the bar, which was first come, first served, like most places.  From entering to leaving, the staff were really nice.  Our server was pretty good.  Even though you could tell she was pretty busy, she managed to be really nice and attentive.  I love me some good customer service and she did a really good job.  The host/hostess were cool.  They clowned my GF for accidentally running into this baby, knocking her down, and making her cry.  For the food, the coffee cake was really good.  Careful though, I think they throw it in the microwave to heat it up a bit, so the filling gets a little hot.  Really good though.  My corned beef hash was OK.  Not bad, but not that exciting either.  GF ordered some kind of enchilada omelette that wasn't very good.  It wasn't gross, but it just lacked flavor all around.  It just tasted like egg and cheese, basically.  The potatoes were addicting, though.  Overall, I think I'd give it another shot and order something different.  *No babies were harmed during this visit*"}
{"text":"Ok, I went to the Summerlin location, but whatever.  I love eating breakfast. Its not unusual for me to go to Denny's at 8pm and order breakfast. And I'm very picky with my breakfast, particularly my eggs.  I ordered the Veggie Benny, which is their vegetarian version of eggs benedict. It has avocados, grilled tomatoes, fresh spinach, two poached eggs, and Hollandaise sauce.   I don't even know how to express how much I love this place. It came with a side of buttery hash browns--and by buttery, I don't mean greasy, I mean deliciously rich. The Veggie Benny was amazing. Seriously. It was the perfect blend of fresh eggs, creamy Hollandaise sauce, freshness from the spinach and avocado, and just a hint of sweetness from the tomatoes. My boyfriend got something to eat too, and he loved it. I don't remember what he got, probably because I was too busy trying to stuff my face full of amazing-ness. (I think he got waffles or pancakes?)  The service was ok. But the taste-gasm I had made up for the so-so service.   Overall, I LOVED this place. I wish they were open at night."}
{"text":"First time here got burnt toast, fake butter, watered down coffee, omelet was flat as a pancake and hurry up and leave service. With so many great options near by I think I will choose something else next time."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the breakfast is great as usual. Breakfast is a pretty simple meal but they do it right! I make the effort to get off the strip and head here every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"When I spend money somewhere, I expect a thank you. The food was fine, but the hostess ignored me when I came in and failed to thank me-- just pushed the receipt at me--when I paid. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Horrible service, I ordered the Californian omelette.  What I got was a flat over cooked thing with two whole pieces of bacon shoved in the middle and a lump of avocado on top that looked like a tumor.  I was shocked, I said I had expected something where the bacon and avocado was chopped up and put inside the omelette, so they took it back.  I swear they didn't even make a fresh one they just chopped up the old returned one and threw more cheese on it.  We asked to speak to the manager, I don't even think they sent him over.  Dude couldn't give two shits about the fact neither thing served was an omelet.    Never going back again, they are rude, and don't give a crap about giving good properly presented food."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to get breakfast or lunch the flavors are great the service is great. Must truths coffee cake"}
{"text":"We each out a fair amount and this place is always great. Very accommodating to our special orders. Coffee is always hot and great customer service to keep our cups full! Our children prefer brunch and they have wonderful soups and salads as well as lots of breakfast foods!!"}
{"text":"Had the veggie benny! It was good! Im super picky and I enjoyed it heavy on the spin tho. I love this location. Last time we were here we chatted w our waiter about his dentist! My boyfriend loves the coffee cake"}
{"text":"Loved having breakfast here! Very good food! The only drawback is that their plates, cups and silverware are way old and worn out. I think they need a makeover of their \"china\". Other than that the service is great and food is good. Just like every other decent breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Great place, great food! Our server was very nice and attentive! The place is very cute, not one of us was disappointed with our meal, there were 8 of us in Father's Day! It was very reasonably priced and I will definitely keep this place in the back of my head for when I'm in town. I definitely recommend the breakfast sandwich croissant. We got our food in a very timely manner, and everything was great. The only bad part was they weren't terribly busy, two 8 tops completely open and the manager I think, maybe she was the hostess tried to offer us two booths after a 39 minute wait, we opted out and then she made it seem like she was doing us a favor by giving us one of the 8 tops. I kind of understood, because what if they had reservations but through our entire meal, the other one never became occupied. So no deal breakers for complaints! Definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"We had a nice meal. We were there late morning and it was still doing a brisk business so obviously he has a good following.  My Mom had fruit plate which was fresh and delicious.  My Dad had a Denver omlet, again very tasty. I had a turkey burger with cheese and mushrooms. Great Turkey burger. Good portions hearty meal."}
{"text":"I'd give it 2.5 stars if possible simply because most of the food is good (not great, not mediocre, just good).  However, the food is overpriced, portions are not huge, and service is usually bad.  Count on spending $12-15 per person for a meal, tax, and tip; add a few more bucks if you're getting a beverage.  Coworkers who suggested this place to me said I could have a full meal for $6; based on menu prices, I assume my coworkers consider toast and coffee a full meal.  The restaurant is very loud and cramped.  Your wooden chairs will get bumped into by anyone trying to pass and the screeching of wood on tiles will give you a headache.  There isn't much of a waiting area and given this place's popularity, you'll probably have to wait.  My chicken chile verde omelet was good, seasoned potatoes very tasty, and our various sandwiches good but nothing special.  The coffee cake was awful.  It was like stale angel cake purchased from a gas station, sprinkled with cinnamon, and stuffed with canned apple pie filling.  Good service usually changes my opinion of a restaurant, but this was downright bad.  Our waiter was curt, only gave us one coffee refill (after flagging him down), and tossed our check on the table before we'd finished eating.  The restaurant was significantly less crowded than when we arrived so I'm not sure why he was in such a hurry to get rid of us.  We're nice people who have worked in restaurants and sympathize with overbusy waitstaff.  I only go here when I'm with pretentious friends who insist on eating at local mom & pop shops instead of IHOP or Denny's.  Eat here if you must and enjoy your smug satisfaction; I'll be over at IHOP feasting on better food for less money."}
{"text":"My wife has been wanting to try this place for awhile so we finally went there. Ordered corn beef hash and found a nice LONG BLACK HAIR IN MY FOOD! Neeless to say I immediately lost my appetite, but these things do happen.  When I told the waitress I thought they should comp my drink as well, she called the manager who said he wouldn't comp the drink but would make me another meal. At that point the last thing I wanted was more food from them. Seemed kind of insulting and keeping the customer happy seemed like the last thing on their minds. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"The \"Haizley's Hot Link Sandwich\" is wonderful. It has a lot of flavor and is a treat for your taste buds. But it is also very messy!  I keep thinking I am going to branch out and try something new but I just can't resist it!"}
{"text":"Had the Monte Cristo yesterday!!! Talk about AMAZING!!! One of the best sandwiches I have ever had!! Maybe because it was dipped in French toast batter and deep fried! LOL! SO GOOD! Must try!!!  Waitress was great! Food came out quickly as well!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice, one time french toast, the second a Denver omelette. The french toast was dry and tough. The omelette was a lot of cheese and light on other ingredients. I've had better at Dennys."}
{"text":"The cracked croissant is to die for. I love to come here every now and then because you don't have to wait ridiculous amount of time for a booth/table compared to other breakfast places. Service is always good here, and they also have outdoor seating which is a plus. Food is amazing all my friends love this place. 5 stars."}
{"text":"I am a montecristo sandwich connoisseur, and this place has definitely one of the best I've ever tasted.  All the other food was certainly passable breakfast fare.  The coffeecake was the lightest textured coffeecake I'd ever encountered.  Four stars for the montecristo, three for the food in general."}
{"text":"First time here, not impressed. The food's not expensive but not cheap 850 for oatmeal. But there was enough oatmeal for a whole family. My son got eggs and corn beef hash. Dear restaurant people, make note, corn beef hash usually contains corned beef this was three little tiny pieces of corn beef and about 3 cups of onions no potatoes no bell pepper no nothing I won't return"}
{"text":"I am usually not a breakfast person but after reading the Yelp reviews I decided to give this place a shot.  I walked in at 10:30am on a Thursday.  There were lots of empty tables and it was not packed at all.  I was seated right away in a nice booth by the window.  Cory was a delightful and on the ball type of server.  I ordered Coffee, Bottled Water, and The North Shore with seasoned potatoes.   Seasoned Potatoes 5/5.  The North Shore was good but had a little to much cheese 4/5.   Coffee 4/5  Service 5/5 I would return but I will wait for warmer weather so I can sit outside."}
{"text":"I am so glad they offer a separate menu for gluten sensitive folks like me. This is a very rare thing. Thank you, Cracked Egg! Good coffee too!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed brunch with my in-laws this morning. Worth the wait. Good food and service. I shared the spinach salad and California omelet with my wife. The cinnamon coffee cake was delicious. This will be a tradition when we visit family. Good value, too."}
{"text":"Watched 5 tables come in after us and get food before us. Won't be back to this one ever again .  Got  food almost hour later  hash browns were still frozen in the middle ...    Really disappointed with this one"}
{"text":"Always have time to stop in here and have a bite. The food  is great, service is awesome. Wait time is minimal especially on a Sunday.   If you ever get a chance to stop in, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Meh.  I love breakfast and there is a tea place right next door I wanted to go to so I was killing two birds with one stone. I got a skillet and my children got chocolate chip pancakes. My son asked for bacon and it was $4 for 3 bits of bacon!!! I thought that was outrageous and wouldn't have let him order it if I looked at the menu and saw that.     I like the seasoned potatoes here. I got any extra order of them that was also about $4 but It wasn't very much. I was able to eat them all in addition to my skillet. The server was nice. I just felt like it was over priced for what we got."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times with my Celiac wife.  They have a legit gluten sensitive menu, although they do share a fryer and toaster. But, they tell you that.  For those that choose GF, you'll maybe not care about the toaster. Wifey just skips the cross-contaminated items and enjoys her meal every time.  Just learned today that in place of their coffee cake which comes with every order, you can not only get the cross contaminated toast, but hey have udi's choc-choc or blueberry muffin. Everyone has always been friendly, prices fair, good food, Celiac friendly."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place, ever! The food is delicious, always cooked correctly and they accept most special requests. Aside from going in on or after after a holiday, the service is fast and seating is too. The coffee cake is the BEST! They have a big selection of items, mostly egg related, of course. I love taking people here because they are always amazed, especially when it comes to the coffee cake, I love it when they have several kinds to choose from and you get a corner or end piece! Heavenly! Their only downside, is they put lemon in the water, by default.."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in town. The coffee cake is awesome. There is a different flavor of coffee cake everyday: anything from Cherry, to chocolate, too peach. I love the Vegas style chicken sandwich.  I always switch out the bun for wheat bread. Their French fries are homemade and crispy . I am also a huge fan of the spinach salad. The spinach salad has a bacon dressing and it is delicious."}
{"text":"Another great breakfast spot, The eggs benedict is quite good, and the breakfast potatoes are solid. A whole lot of yummy omelet combinations, and of course all the breakfast classics. Pretty good lunch menu as well, with the burgers and sandwiches. Overall a solid choice for breakfast, lunch or anything in between."}
{"text":"New favorite breakfast place. Prices are extremely reasonable and the food doesn't lack flavor. Just moved to the area and after discovering this gem me and my girlfriend came here 3 weekends in a row. The staff are all welcoming and the service is awesome. My coffee cup never reaches the bottom. This is the type of place that will have you coming back time and time again."}
{"text":"My bf & I went into the cracked egg on July 5th 2015 . Between eleven & noon. It was very busy. Maybe two tables available if that . We got seated very fast . Very friendly waitress  We ordered the monte cristo  Ham , turkey,  Swiss cheese in french toast deep fried!  & a Denver omlet , which she kindly let me substitute sausage instead of ham. ( im 8 months pregnant & picky )  Both came with potatoes ( hash or seasoned , we ordered one of each) & the omlet came with toast or coffee cake! I ordered coffee cake. Two waters & one soda. To our surprise our food was ready so fast! Mayb 10 mins!  ( idk maybe we got lucky! ) We both LOVED our meals & were so satisfied. They have large portions. ( Omlets are jade with 3 eggs)  We both took half our meals home! The COFFEE CAKE is to die for! Best I've ever had. Seriously so moist & sweet. Loved it. I would go back just for the cake.  Prices were fair. More or less IHOP type prices. ( but the quality is much better)  Our total was 23 dollars & change.  I have nothing to complain about.  I didn't hear one complaint from any customers around me. I find that rare , I always here someone at least say, \"oh you forgot this\" but no everyone was on their game!  My bf hates going out to dine in places, ( he's a homebody) but said he would love to come back to this place! We plan to take family & friends here when they come out to Vegas to visit  Great job to the staff! A++ thanks guys!"}
{"text":"How good can eggs be? Pretty damn good here. There is always a wait on the weekends but I dont mind 20 min for the delicous food. Even when they are a super busy the service is great.   Today I tried the Joes and wifey had the north shore. Bomb. I love the coffee cake and the hash is really good which is what I usually get.   There is a long wait on the weekends for a reason. Its worth it."}
{"text":"This place is great! So far we have been here twice and we were pleased with the service as well as the food. Make sure to sign up for their loyalty card and you'll score some coupons."}
{"text":"The hot spot to be in Henderson,  this place is always jamming and no wonder. The coffee and the coffee cake are great wake ups in the morning. Egg whites are available and if you do have to wait it's not too bad. Weekends are busy with family and kids but it's worth it. Ask for Juan and tip him at least 10 to 15 % of your annual income, he 's a nice guy."}
{"text":"This place is cute and easy. The food is great, space is clean, and staff was really nice. The Huevos Rancheros are great! I can't wait to come back for an easy meal."}
{"text":"We came here in time, we got seated after 5 minutes. I say this because after a while, there was line and people were waiting even outside to get seated so I'm relieved that we didn't have to wait.   This is my first time here-- it's family oriented that's good for groups too. Our waiter got our drinks right away. I got cranberry mixed with orange juice and south shore scramble. It was a good mix of heart healthy and indulging. South shore was scrambled with eggs, cheese, bacon, and avocado on top with a side of seasoned potatoes. It was good and the portion was just right. I also got coffee as a side. I was so full from the scramble that I barely touched it. I still liked the texture and it's sweetness. It wasn't overwhelming."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Always great food and friendly staff!! Can't go wrong w any food here!! Breakfast or lunch any time. I love getting the club sandwich- always stacked high with a huge amount of fresh avocados!!  The seasoned potatoes and coffee cake  are in house made and to die for!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, but customer service was lacking. Hostess gave us 15 min wait but never gave us heads up when our table was ready, and skipped us. The waitress didn't introduced herself when we were seated, she just walked away when we asked for some time to look over the menu. When our food came that was the last we saw of her unless we physically flagged her down for assistance."}
{"text":"Pretty decent breakfast and the wait wasn't that bad for a Sunday...tried the coffee cake that everyone raves about but it really didn't blow my socks off...very good but more like angel food/birthday cake than coffee cake...  Had the bacon cheeseburger scramble and they use loose ground beef which I wasn't expecting but pretty good regardless....  Service was prompt and the beverages we're good...overall I'd be back but only if I'm on this side of town."}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg closes at 2:00 PM, I know that. However, I work grave yard and I get there as soon as I can which is usually around 1:00-1:30. Today, I got there at 1:30. It was very cold in there as if they turned off the heat and when my wife, daughter and I got our coffee, it was cold. The waitress oppologized and explained that since they close at 2:pm, they shut the coffee machine down for cleaning and closing at 1:00 and put coffee in carafs. She threw it in the microwave for us to heat it up, but honestly, it made it slightly bitter. With as good as the food is (it's excellant, BTW), they must get a lot of business during the morning, so it's hard for me to believe that the owner can't afford to leave the heater and the coffee pot on until 2:00! A secondary and mostly unimportant complaint is that I got only coffee and my wife and daughter got coffee, and both got the cracked croissant breakfast and shared a peice of the coffee cake (I highly recommend the cake). The total bill was $35 plus tip minus $8 coupon. So still basically $35 for two breakfasts out the door. That's pretty pricey. We still come because we can't resist the food or the coupon! (I say unimportant because if I don't like the price I could simply not go there, but I thought the readers should know that without the coupon, it would cost about $20 per person.)"}
{"text":"What a great breakfast I've had in a while. The servers were very fast and awesome. The bathrooms were extremely clean and the food was very good. It was the best piece of bacon I've had in a long time. I can't exactly say the price because I didn't pay. The quality of the food was great though. And the coffee cake was very tasty and warm of pumpkin flavor. I would come to dine here again when in my adventures of Vegas."}
{"text":"Cute little joint to have a comfortable breakfast with the family.  Service was very friendly and welcoming. Food was delicious, good portions, and good prices. It is in a quiet little shopping center by Ann and the 95. My boys and husband really enjoyed the food.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great service, fast cooks, delicious food, and a great price! This place was really good. THE BEST CRISPY BACON EVER! So good! Omelettes are delicious, the Nutella s'mores French toast is sooooo awesome, and the eggs were great! Coffee was good for a good breakfast place. We will absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"Always noticed this driving and visiting Archie's for lunch (in the same complex). I asked the server if this place was related to \"Egg Works\" / \"Egg and I\"? She replied \"the owner here used to be a part owner of Egg and I..\" Similarities in the menu were obvious.. \" Well, I'm a fan of Egg and I, so I guess this place should be good too?!   Coffee Cake: Fresh, Spongy Soft, a little sweet/cinnamony.. Delicious! Reminded me of the 'Heavenly' Banana Nut muffin at Egg and I..  Homemade Corned Beef Hash: Real corned beef, short slices mixed with diced onions and bell peppers.. Eggs on top (I opted for egg whites this time). I went with their hashbrowns, it came on a separate dish (decent size). The Corned Beef was good, better than the usual canned versions. Hash Browns were average.  Chicken Fried Steak, Gravy and Eggs: Nicely portioned, chicken and gravy was good, eggs scrambled, seasoned potatoes (identical to seasoned potatoes at Egg and I) came as little fried treats with heavy seasoning and the white toast just like at every other restaurant.  Service, Atmosphere, Value and Taste: Overall, just squeezed into the 4 star level, in my opinion (the coffee cake gave them the edge). I plan to try more of their offerings.. If you like Egg and I, then you should feel the same for this place.. Or if your a breakfast person, it should satisfy!"}
{"text":"Classic American Breakfasts.  Had the Benedict, non-traditional with spinach and tomato, a great choice.   Way better than a Denny's or Coco's but they could be used as an example of what corporate/franchise America would do to this place given the chance."}
{"text":"I love breakfast and this place is a fam fav.  we love to come here on a sunday to start our day with a light yummy brunch.  i'm giving it 3 stars because the girls who are behind the counter NEVER look friendly.  they are the welcome you see when you walk in... sometimes the looks on their faces are uncomfortable.. it's weird.  don't expect a smile when U come in.  it's really rare they look happy.. but think it's life issues they wear on their face.. so i don't take it personal. neither should you.  the plus:  THE FOOD! and the waitresses on the other hand are really friendly and helpful with ordering tips.  food comes quick and the portions are perfect for the price.    there's a lot of omelets to choose from.. my favs are the south and north shore.  daughter and I love the stuffed p b and j French toast.. tah-die!"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife and friends. There is nothing to complain about, I came here twice within the span of about 2 weeks. The first time I got country fried chicken with hash browns and toast. With a side of their coffee cake which is absolutely delish. My entire meal was tasty, everyone liked their breakfast they ordered.  The second time I got eggs Benedict, I didn't like it as much, but was still good. Overall, don't pass on the coffee cake. Very solid option for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place keeps getting more and more popular and there is usually always a wait. Not saying this is a bad thing, but when your hungry and or hungover... I want/need food!! Their Benedict ole is the bomb... That bernaise sauce is like candy in my mouth. Also, their coffee cake is heaven in my mouth too!!  The only downfall is they don't serve bloody Mary's... If they did it would complete my great breakfast experiences! I'm not going to lie.... I something choose egg works for breakfast, because I can get my weekend Bloody Mary fix."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's my go to breakfast place. I recommend the chili skillet, California omelet, French toast... Everything is delicious. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places. I love the French toast & the eggs Benedict. I always leave satisfied!"}
{"text":"The wait was horrible. The service has gotten real bad. They forgot refill our coffee after we asked for more by the time they came we had finished breakfast. Half my food was cold and the other half hot. Their service has declined. I have been coming to this place for years. Unfortunately this was our last time to come."}
{"text":"Terrible service, starts with a simple request of Mickey Mouse pancakes for the little one. Manager says absolutely not because then everyone would want them the they are too busy.... hmm simply put \"we don't care about the customer\" very rude manager. Most all others have this available. Worth the drive to egg works. Amazing staff and defiantly family friendly."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in north Las Vegas.  The location is lousy, the tables are wobbly, and the lighting is gloomy.  But the food is 1950's ambrosia.  The service is very friendly and accommodating.  Bonus - they speak Spanish if you want to eat your eggs while hearing a foreign language.  (Our server spoke perfect English.)  We had a large party and they sat us within 20 minutes at the tail need of breakfast. Seriously delectable oatmeal.   Eggs and bacon were near if not perfect.  And the omelets, eggs Benedict, and sweet rolls were amazing.  I'm really glad I was able to try a bite of everything.  That oatmeal plate they have was huge - filled with fruit and granola.  But the rest was so good I couldn't help but try.  Nice job y'all! We'll be back with out appetites."}
{"text":"To trash this place is to not understand what a good breakfast place is. The wait proves their worth and the dishes are prepared to perfection. The only real downside is showing up late on the weekend. And the OJ is not unlimited refill. All in all, one of the best in town especially with the local coupons which are usually B1G1"}
{"text":"I was excited about a little local restaurant off of the the strip. unfortunately the food was average at best the server was not friendly and screwed up the order not once not twice but three times and it was overpriced"}
{"text":"This place was pretty packed when I visited, but it was during breakfast on the weekend, so I guess it was my fault for choosing a popular time to go! There were plenty of gluten free options available, which I was very appreciative of. The waitress was attentive and super friendly, the food came out quickly, and overall the taste was delicious and the cost was pretty low. It's a great location right off the 215 and just a bit further north of the Arroyo shopping center - a great place to stop for a quick bite in the middle of running errands!"}
{"text":"It's open only for breakfast/lunch hours. Is located in a food court setting, with outdoor seating options. Device was friendly as fast. Seats are metal with some cushion. Not the type to stay for hours, but serviceable comfy. For a neighborhood breakfast joint, it delivers better than expected.   Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"My husband and i come here alot for breakfast and if we have visitors from out of town and they wanna have breakfast.. this is the place to bring them.'Eggs Benedict never let down. I always order them with the season potatoes. Their coffee cake is so good too and fresh! the service is really good and quick. hey always try to accommodate you. I also like the salads.. It's big and plentiful! Definitely an awesome place for breakfast and lunch!"}
{"text":"I am sorry to say I will never visit this venue again.  I love their food but when I went in with my service dog who does not wear a vest, instead of asking me if he's a service dog she didn't even look at me and said \"I don't think that's a service animal and I want that dog out of here\"  Rude.  It's so simple to follow the law and ask \"Is that a service dog\""}
{"text":"LOVE The Cracked Egg!  This is probably one of my most favorite restaurants...in the WORLD. There is a location super close to my parent's house at home, and the though of going here is comforting and exciting (wow that's not at all cheesy). I often go with one of my best friends Ame, which probably adds to why I love this place so much.   Everything here is delicious. My friend Ame has ordered the Garden Patch omelette and enjoyed it quite a bit. My cousin and brother have gotten the scrambles and the sandwiches over the years, and I never hear a complaint from them. I almost always get one of Breanne's Basics, which all come with home fries/hash browns and either toast or coffee cake.   Speaking of coffee cake - HOLY SMOKES IT IS AMAZING. It is cinnamony, fluffy, usually a generous serving, and is served warm. You MUST get it. Even though I usually get one of the Basics meals, this cake kinda makes it extra awesome. Even if you get a sandwich, order the coffee cake. DO IT!  Service is always wonderful, and the place is always clean. I've been here more times than I can count on my hands combined and have always had five star service."}
{"text":"Wowza, this place is popular!  Rolled up here on Saturday around 11:30am.  25 minute wait!  Luckily, it was an absolutely beautiful day and we had no problem waiting outside. :)  When we were sat, we were greeted immediately by a guy taking our drink orders.  There were four of us and he promptly brought us our drinks (water, coffee and orange juice).  We ordered: *Bacon & Eggs- scrambled eggs, a couple slices of bacon, seasoned potatoes and toast or coffee cake. ($8.25) -Three out of the four of us ordered this dish.  The eggs were nice and fluffy!  You get I think three pieces of bacon.  I'm more of a crispy bacon kind-of-person and these were a little \"rare\" for me, but my husband liked them!  The portion is HUGE!  In fact, I ate most of the eggs, two tiny pieces of the seasoned potatoes (which covered half of the plate), one piece of bacon and I was stuffed!  *Build your own skillet: eggs, cheese & sausage ($9.25) and it comes with seasoned potatoes and toast or coffee cake. -My husband enjoyed his skillet, which again was a huge portion.  He LOVED the coffee cake which had caramel in it with a thin drizzle of icing on the top.  I wish I had room to try it- it looked yummy!  I would definitely come back here.  I would love to try some of their \"funky\" dishes, if I had someone, err two other people, to share it with!  Did I like it better than Egg Works?  I would have to give this place a second try before making that call..."}
{"text":"Always good :) the croissant French toast is great . They do need a baby changing table in the restrooms thou."}
{"text":"There's just something about yummy egg dishes. And this spot has plenty of them to choose from. Not to mention the coffee cake, pancakes, etc.  The good: - So many egg options! Omelettes, scrambles, skillets, oh my. Cheesey, spicy, veggies, meat, so many options. And it's all filling yummy.  The meh: - Long waits on weekends. - Coupons are only valid during the week. - No alcohol. So no bloody marys or mimosas, which are kind of a key part of breakfast for me. - Bleh service. Nice. But inattentive and slow.  Overall, I would come here again because my egg dish was good. But the meh list keeps me from wanting to come back often."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. My girlfriend had the breakfast burrito and it was the best breakfast burrito I've ever had. They season their potatoes amazingly. I had the croissant French toast and it was delicious! Service was prompt and friendly. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Diana was VERY nice but could have been more attentive. The food was EXTREMELY good and served piping hot. All our special requests were met perfectly. Restaurant very clean. Instant seating at 1:30pm on a Sunday. Noise level comfortable. And I'm fairly certain that Diana is a reigning beauty queen somewhere down in the South because her accent and Southern Charm are fabulous. She's unique and fun to have as a server."}
{"text":"This has got to be our absolute favorite restaurant for brunch. They even offer a complete Gluten Free menu! Absolutely delicious food. We love the patio seating! Service is always on point. Coffee cake is to die for. Choose this little spot you won't be disappointed. We are absolute fans!"}
{"text":"4/5 everything is great, just a little expensive for what you get. But, this place is always packed, so they're doing something right."}
{"text":"This has to be my second brunch place, just behind Bea Bea's in Burbank. However, this would make it my favorite brunch place in Vegas!   I was on a gal pals weekender trip to Vegas and we choose The Cracked Egg to end our two days of gorging (which is what gal pals do: get fat together and chat about life and getting fat).   We lucked out as we were seated right away. The service was prompt and attentive. Our server took our drink order within a minute of us being seated and seemed to return with beverages almost instantly after.   The menu is just stocked but not too stocked (i.e. Jerry's Famous Deli). It seemed like everything was really well planned and that they only put real bangers on their list of offerings.   We asked for recommendations and were informed that all of the boxed items were considered the more popular and highly demanded items so we paid those extra attention, but our server also shared some of her favorites. A staffer with favorites that aren't boxed tells me the food's awesome either way so I was excited.   We all decided to pick an item and then eat our meal family style. What we selected were:  - Chocolate chip banana pancakes: I usually see banana pancakes OR chocolate chip pancakes so seeing both in one on a menu made it an automatic selection. They were everything I wanted and more. The dish came with three pancakes, all ozzing with melty chips and sweetened by bananas that were juuuust about caramelized, but still fresh tasting. They were so good I didn't need butter or syrup, but I still smeared butter, because I can't deny my inner fatty.   - Chicken tenders, gravy, and eggs How have I not had this before? The chicken tenders were great on their own, but with The Cracked Egg's gravy, hashbrowns, and over medium eggs, we were swooning. (only critique is that I prefer my hashbrowns a little browner)  - Corned beef hash Really good. I consider it a cleaner version than the usual greasy and chunky standard, but I enjoyed it.   - Veggie Benedict It seemed plain with just avocado and tomato but, man, was it tasty. The tomato was lightly cooked so it oozed flavor and was delicious combined with the avocado, hollandaise, and yolk from the poached egg.   - Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Coffee Cake You mean this was FREE? We got two pieces since two of our dishes (the corned beef and tenders) came with an option of biscuit or coffee cake. This was ABSOFRIKKINLUTELY a surprise. This took your usual coffee cake, grabbed it by throat, and kicked it in its genitalia.   Oh and the prices were really fair for brunch (cuz, yaknow, LA brunch like to act like it deserves dinner prices).   By the time we left, the place was swamped, but the staff was very visibly keeping everything moving so I don't think anyone waited too long.   This was the perfect spot to end our weekend and I hope I'm back in Vegas soon to hit up those tenders!"}
{"text":"I love this place the veggie benny is the best in town and they even customize mine to be just the way I like it and it's always done with a smile. I have lunch with my girlfriends at least once if not twice a week and though the menu is extensive we always have the same thing that's how good it is. Love love love this place :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Hands down the best breakfast joint in Las Vegas. My wife and I eat here every week. The food is very good. The cooks are excellent and also present the food very well. The service is completely phenomenal. The wait staff there are hand-picked and fit the environment of the restaurant. They care about the restaurant and seem like a big family. If your server doesn't bring you a coffee refill, someone else will.   To anyone that thinks Babystacks is better: the village must have lost an idiot. We went to Babystacks this morning.  It was horrible. The seating is very uncomfortable. The staff is all young and seem very inexperienced. The food was subpar with a higher price tag.  Would never eat there again.   Cracked Egg you are awesome and your owners must really know how to run a restaurant. Unlike most of the other restaurants in town. Great job."}
{"text":"On the journey across America, our first stop was Sin City. My cousin recommended me this breakfast spot called, The Cracked Egg, which was only a few minutes away from the strip. The Cracked Egg on Rainbow Boulevard was located in a strip mall which was pretty empty for a Saturday afternoon. I guess that's what happens when it was over a hundred degrees out. This restaraunt closes at 3:00 P.M, which gave me the impression that their menu must be way above average to be able to serve only breakfast and have multiple locations.  Me and my friend reached the restaurant first so we grabbed a table for us and our three friends that were going to meet us there. Our waitress was very kind and told us it was no problem to wait in our booth while we wait for our friends. She even brought out five waters for us while she waited for our group to get together. The menu had a large variety of breakfast foods. They had the typical breakfast foods of eggs, sausages, omelettes, skillets, burgers, and other things.  I ordered the Homemade Corned Beef Hash, which was made of bell peppers, onions, and eggs. I chose to have hash browns and coffee cake on the side instead of seasoned potatoes and toast. The coffee cake arrived first and I was delighted to see that it was hot, instead of the usual cold pastries many breakfast places serve. Shortly after I finished my coffee cake, the table's main dishes came out. The Homemade Corned Beef Hash came out in a glass skillet styled dish.           It didn't resemble the typical corned beef hash found in cans, but it looked more like ham, bell peppers, and onions put underneath two scrambled eggs. My hash browns were served on a separate plate.  I was very impressed with the quality of ingredients used to make such a simple meal. The eggs were fresh, and the cooking of the hash browns were perfect. None of the potatoes were burnt, unlike many other breakfast style restaurants. The Cracked Egg is probably one of the best breakfast spots I have been to. Their quality of food and service is probably why they can afford to open their restaurants until only 3:00 P.M! I will definitely come again next time I'm in Vegas for my breakfast fix!"}
{"text":"Food: C+ Decor: D- (Is it a barn? Is it a rundown Denny's?  What??) Service: B- Prices: HIGH!  A 2 for 1 coupon drew me in but I was unimpressed as I sat down on the semi-padded booth seats which must be 100 years old. The menu is extensive with both breakfast and lunch entrees. Something for everyone. Prices seemed to range between $9 and $14. Little pricey for breakfast.   The hash browns seemed soaked in grease and weren't very hot (reheated maybe?). The bacon was extra chewy, leading me to believe it was cooked much earlier in the day and ''stored'' until needed.   It's drab and dark inside of the restaurant, and the employees seemed not to care much. Could have been cleaner in my opinion.   Sorry but I'll take EggWorks ANY day."}
{"text":"We come in almost weekly for some good breakfast. And for today's breakfast I have 4 words: Red Velvet Coffee Cake. It was amazing. I could have eaten a second and third piece."}
{"text":"Breakfast is always amazing at any cracked egg in the Vegas area I've attended three and they have all been amazing if you haven't tried their coffee cake you literally have not lived . So amazing !"}
{"text":"This place is such an awesome breakfast stop ! The service was great and I love the atmosphere of this place it's so relaxed and laid back . We got our food quick and it was delicious my little one loved his French toast and ate all of his food. Love this spot !"}
{"text":"Tried this place out one day after a good workout. I tried out the veggie benedict which was delicious! I got the seasoned potatoes on the side and it went well with the whole meal. The benny was cooked perfectly and the tomatoes and spinach weren't super soggy like you might expect. It was also topped with a bunch of avocado which was a plus because I feel like when you go to breakfast restaurants and order anything with avocado they skimp the amount. It was topped with delicious hollandaise but they might have put a bit too much on mine but that is only a very minor complaint. They were offering freshly made mocha coffee cake and also an oreo flavor which looked like I had to have it but I skipped on it since I just had s good workout. It was a sad decision because it looked so damn good lol."}
{"text":"I love me some Cracked Egg I'll tell you what.   Coffee cake alone is enough reason to come here. It's light, fluffy, warm, steamy, sweet, and they're constantly updating the flavors like a pumpkin one in the fall or the berry one I had last.   My favorite things to order for an entree are the scrambles, particularly the South Shore with chicken and avocado. Their corned beef hash is scrumptious and tasty as well.  Tried soup and salad also, portions are HUGE. Great place to brunch."}
{"text":"Usually a wait. Food is so so. Expensive for what you get. Slow service. Egg works down the street is a better choice. Very similar menu but more home cooked taste especially the breakfast potatoes. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I've been here before and it's been the same experience, fast service, good food and nice portions. Nothing extraordinary, but good.  The one complaint this time is that I ordered the corn beef hash breakfast and was disappointed that it had very little corn beef in it, like 25% beef and 75% potato. My suggestion, skip the corn beef hash breakfast."}
{"text":"My Review For/Of The Cracked Egg   The Place Is Absolutely Wonderful To Go Have Breakfast  & (And) Lunch . The Service Is Wonderful, The Employees/Workers Do Such A Great Job There Every Day, The Chairs/Seats Are Always Clean, The Menu Selections Are Good/Great & (And) Everything Else Important (Etc.)."}
{"text":"i ordered kinda complicated lol, food was amazing! the coffee cake tho is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Always 4 Stars .. Breakfast is always delicious.  I always  request extra crispy hashbrowns.  Hit & miss on service and wait time ... Ty to go around 6:30-7:30 am no wait then :)"}
{"text":"Their build your own skillets are amazing. But the coffee cake is why I go back! It's always a different flavor and delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and unique. I like places that offer something different and this is one of those places. The rasp stuffed French toast was the best"}
{"text":"First time here & wasn't disappointed. The room has a bit of an institutional feel but that was easily overlooked. The service was quick & attentive & my raspberry stuffed french toast was wonderful. There was no kids menu, so my son had to order a full price portion that he was never going to eat.  All in all, nothing to write home about, but I won't avoid it in the future either."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is super friendly and efficient and the food feels like a home cooked meal. A tad on the pricey side for breakfast but portion sizes are generous. My personal favorite is the cracked croissant because how can you go wrong with bacon on a croissant? The answer is you can't. Do expect some wait time on a Saturday or Sunday morning though I've never personally waited longer than 20 minutes."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch/breakfast spot to eat at when we are in town. I end up getting the same Kayla's Salad. The salad has diced apples, walnuts, golden raisins and blue cheese crumbles. I highly recommend a half salad because the whole one will feed 3 people easily.   They have several options for breakfast and lunch. Service is excellent and most of them have been there for at least 4 plus years.   Go early the place gets packed fast once the doors open up!"}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Sunday morning. Service was great, the food didn't take too long especially for a Sunday. Our server was super nice and kept checking up on us to make sure we were ok. Only thing that didn't quiet make this a great experience is that I order avocado on my sandwich and they charged me almost $2 for it. Which is normal in most restaurants except when I opened my sandwich it was literally two slices of avocado. That's not cool."}
{"text":"Came in for my some delicious breakfast a bout a week ago and got it! Eggs Benedict and french toast on the side! Definitely my new favorite breakfast place! There is a huge selection of things to order, i wonder what i will try next..."}
{"text":"Overall this was a great place really enjoyed the breakfast.  It is a little far to drive early in the morning, but sometimes it is worth it when you are hungry.  Good variety as well - plenty to choose from."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive about visiting The Cracked Egg since many of the reviews so far weren't so good. I'd been watching the construction of this restaurant since it is very close to my job and I frequent some of the other businesses in the area.  Luckily, either I visited at a good time of day, or they worked out the initial kinks in service, because I had a lovely experience.  The restaurant is bright and cheerful, with a semi-open kitchen. There are several large booths and tables throughout, as well as patio seating (no dogs allowed, the sign is pretty prominent).   I was seated promptly, my drink order was taken right away, and my server checked on me throughout the meal. I enjoyed my Californian omelette, which was served with a choice of home fries, hash browns, or fruit along with a choice of toast or coffee cake. Next time, I will definitely get the coffee cake, because it looked great. I was able to sample a piece (my friend got the coffee cake), and it was really yummy. Apparently, they have different varieties daily. Prices were reasonable, with most items averaging between $10-$12.  I expect that The Cracked Egg gets really busy on the weekends, and the parking situation was already pretty tight because there are so many other businesses nearby. It is nice having a breakfast/brunch option in Summerlin!"}
{"text":"The decor in this place was super cute. We came to the relization that coffee shops have the best customer service. Our waitress was excellent. It was a very homely enviornment. Yes, the coffee cake is a must. The day we went, we had the pumpkin pecan coffee cake, and it was a great start to our meal. I got the Country Benny with Hash Browns. It was really good! I would definitely get this again with extra gravy!! My boyfriend got the California Omlete with Potatoes. It was also pretty good. My only complaint about this place was how much they charged for the side sauce. A side of salsa and a side of sour cream were both $1+ each. I think $.50 - $.75 is more reasonable. It's a ways from the strip, but a great place to eat before heading back home to California. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Service was great and food was terrific. We had the corned beef hash breakfast. There was so much food that we wished we would have shared one order instead of getting two."}
{"text":"The ambiance is okay, prices are a little high for what they offer. Service is polite and food is tasty. Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"The Cordon Bleu skillet -- one of the best egg dishes I have ever had.  Friendly service, casual vibe."}
{"text":"I've eaten here multiple times and I'm just now getting to write a review, lol.  Depending on what time you come, this location tends to be pretty packed. I believe the longest I had to wait for seating was about 10 minutes, nothing more.  The servers are always friendly and very attentive. Also, food comes out in very good time. Coffee and water is constantly refilled. And paying at the end of the meal consists of going up to the register.  The omelette or scramble choices here are pretty good. Do not ask for soft scramble! My eggs came out pretty runny when I asked for them not to be. But for next time, I know not to ask for soft, instead medium scramble.  The coffee cake here is to die for. I usually get a slice of it and it comes out nice and hot. They also have variations of the coffee cake from week to week.  Is it my first breakfast place joint of choice? No. But it's definitely not my last."}
{"text":"The coffee cake is amazing. We go to this place every time we are in Vegas.  The portions are pretty large and it is a nice place to take your family for breakfast or lunch.    I am a picky egg eater and they get my eggs right every time."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this restaurant today. My friends and family meet every Saturday at Egg Works near Sunset Park. The one time we decide to branch out to the other restaurants and it doesn't start off well at all. Our organizer checked it out a week ago and even called in a reservation for our large group. We get here and they apologize profusely because they allowed a large party of 17 people in just before us and pretty much told us calling in advance for reservations does not do any good. Not professional or organized. Not good for planned large parties, especially parties with several elderly and handicapped members.   If you do want one that will actually honor large planned gatherings, professionally and with organizational skills, one who won't blame your party for their lack of both, then try Egg Works on Sunset. Not good, The Cracked Egg, not good.   I'll update if we ever get a table.  We were seated at 30 min after we arrived and now feeling a little better. The server was very nice and prompt.   Okay, now that I've had coffee and my MIL is comfortable, I'm going to upgrade the rating to 3 stars. Menu looks nice and I'm excited to try the coffee cake.   Food and service was excellent. They don't do muffins like Egg Works, but they do make a very tasty apply cinnamon cream cheese coffee cake. We might try again for our group brunch and we hope it was just a fluke."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time after seeing a friends review  The food is really good ! The customer service was great Our waitress which I didn't get her name but 'she's the older lady with red hair and nice nails' was very attentive and polite  We'll definitely be back !!"}
{"text":"I'm not a real big breakfast fan but this place was top notch. We came on a Sunday morning around 11:00. There was a short wait but totally worth it.   I ordered the corned beef hash with two poached eggs, hash browns and coffee cake. The corned beef was fresh and homemade, not that canned stuff and seasoned perfectly with bell peppers and onions. The hash browns were good but nothing out of the ordinary but my mom had the country potatoes and she said they were \"really good\" with a smile. The coffee cake was also an added bonus and delicious. It came out before our meal and was nice and warm!  My husband ordered an omelette with sausage (can't remember which one) but he devoured it. He also added country gravy, which I initially thought was a little gross but it was actually pretty damn good!   Service was good and everyone was friendly. You pay at the counter and don't forget to pick up your little chocolate mint in a basket next to the register."}
{"text":"Too crowded for my taste. Coffee cake is nice and warm, food is good, not knock your socks off good. I got the regular grand slam like breakfast and it was alright. Prices are okay too, but u would t go out of my way for this place."}
{"text":"One of my favourite new places for breakfast, the owner Luke goes above and beyond to make everything perfect the food is awesome and they have the best chilli in Phoenix,The service is impeccable, love Jennifer and Trish they are the best, and your coffee cup is never empty, would recommend this place to everyone, great job guys"}
{"text":"I like the cracked egg, great tradional american breakfast. Hae been here 4 times and will be back. Its worth driving out to (not that far). Get off the strip, explore Vegas there are quite a few great places like the Cracked Egg."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday morning after a hike at Red Rock Canyon. Glad we did! Seated immediately. Hostess was friendly. Waitress came and asked if we had any questions which she answered expertly and patiently. Our food came quickly and was close to perfect. I had the Veggie Benedict and my bff/husband had a tuna melt. Fabulous on all accounts. Entrees run about $10 on average. We left very satisfied and look forward to returning and trying the coffee cake which comes in different varieties throughout the day."}
{"text":"Was referred by a friend as a spot that I MUST go to! It was really good, they got my order correct with my specialty add-ons...my MIL likes her eggs runny and she said they were perfect. Now my friend said the coffee cake was to die for...for me it was just okay (hence the 4) it was warm, light n fluffy (almost like angel food), with a raspberry filling (that's the part I didn't like). I'd go back next time I'm in Henderson"}
{"text":"Went about 8:00 am today and the place was empty. We had the GVP (?) omelet which had mostly all spinach nothing else. The avocado was brown and the cheese (Muenster) was just one big melted blob. Also ordered the Monte Cristo as I had been craving one...all I can say is greasy, greasy and greasy. Soooo disappointed because I have eaten here before (quite a long while ago) and I remembered it to be delish...Not today..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get breakfast. The portions are larger which makes for a great second meal. The texture of the coffee cake is always perfect. I have gotten a few different omelettes and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great breakfasts. Menu has unique items that are reasonably priced with large portions. They are always busy but you get seated relatively quickly. Great service always. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Our waitress was 5 star. We ordered the breakfast burrito & it was very tasty & a little spicy... Comes with hash browns or seasoned potatoes. Hash browns were way better... Also you get toast or coffee cake if you want it... Chocolate chips in the coffee cake.   Eggs Benedict come in several varieties... We tried the vegetable type & it was good but would recommend clarification to the wait staff as to how you want it cooked. We found the eggs to be a bit undercooked.   Also, if you don't want the English Muffin with the Benedict, you must ask them not to include it.  Vegetable means veggies on top of the English Muffin, topped with Spinach, Tomato & Avocado."}
{"text":"Went today for brunch, egg Benedict was yum. My family also enjoyed their meal . Service is good too"}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg is my favorite breakfast spot in Vegas. The coffee cake is ALWAYS good and the scrambles are the best. All of the locations are small and intimate. The staff is always super friendly and happy to make suggestions if, like me, you can't make a decision on your own. They've never steered me wrong."}
{"text":"I have recommended this great cafe to all my friends. The prices are very reasonable. The food is excellent and the service is exceptional."}
{"text":"Pretty good but nothing special. Definitely better than IHOP or Denny's, though. Have a few interesting omelettes and scrambles but nothign to really write home about. Would go again if I'm in the area and looking for breakfast but not making a special trip."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in Las Vegas. The coffee cake is the best I've ever had! Beware: it has apples at the bottom, like an apple pie filling, which my husband prefers not to have. He will eat all of the fluffy cake parts though while I try to stab his hand with my fork. It's MINE!  Service is fast and friendly. My favorite breakfast meal is chicken fried steak and eggs, which is perfect here. My husband likes plain season potatoes without onions chopped into it...and that's what they serve here!  I've never had to wait for a seat here. I usually go before 11 am on weekdays, though!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to The Cracked Egg.  We are not local, but travel to Las Vegas regularly.  ATMOSPHERE:  This is a casual and roomy restaurant.  They make the most of their space, but it definitely didn't feel cramped in any way.  SERVICE: Average.  Our server was friendly and offered her suggestions when asked.  She was very busy with many tables.  I was a little disappointed when she dropped off the bill without us asking for it, or asking if we were finished with our meal.  But when I needed a box to take my food to go, we had to flag her down.  FOOD: The Enchilada -- Had just the right mixture of ingredients.  The sauce to pepper to tortilla to egg ratios complemented one another exquisitely without overpowering each other.  The hash browns were crispy (at our request) and tasty.  The coffee cake side was warm, sweet and delicious.  Croissant French Toast -- very tasty.  The bread was a little chewier than I'd hoped for but in retrospect, some croissants are chewy so I'm not sure this is avoidable.  The berries were absolutely delectable - fresh and full of flavor.  Overall, we were very satisfied with this experience and would return."}
{"text":"I order from the cracked egg all the time. I love the food it's always made perfectly, the one time it wasn't they quickly remade my meal for me which I appreciated. Most of the people who work there are super friendly, the servers, and as well as the manager. The only problem I have, and this is what ruins this restaurant for me, is the girls at the front. I always come in, and leave feeling like I was friendlier than them. They never have a smile or a nice greeting for take out orders. Also I personally work at the front of my work and do a better job greeting and asking people how they are once in awhile other than feeling like I'm at a morgue. Other than that great food rude ladies at the front."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today . I have drives in this plaza with tropical smoothie and the other stores multiple times and never even knew this restaurant was here . All the booths were taken when we went here , and we took that as a good sign. We didn't have to wait longer than maybe 15 minutes for one though. They have a good kids menu and good pencils and activity menu to keep the children entertained. I had a breakfast burrito with eggs potatoes and cheese and added spinach and it was delicious. The service was very good and they were very attentive and on top of everything . We were very happy with everything and will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Stopped here with my mom for a late brunch around 1pm and got in right away. The staff was super nice, very attentive, and our food arrived very quickly. We both ordered black coffee and were pleasantly surprised how good and smooth it was. I drank 2 cups! My mom ordered huevos rancheros. I ordered the pesto scramble with seasoned potatoes and toast. We also split a banana pancake. Everything was so yummy and the portions were a good size. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for some breakfast.  I had the chorizo and eggs which was good but the eggs could have been cooked a little more.  Other than that the meal was good."}
{"text":"Food is always pretty decent but this past visit the service wasn't great.  They were busy, but could have been better."}
{"text":"This place was great!! Good food!! Friendly people!! If you order the biscuit, it is ridiculous. It was about 4\" high and 4\" round. Flaky and delicious."}
{"text":"I decided to stop in and I ordered the Monte Cristo which was ok. The hash browns were excellent;  I have heard so many good things about this Restaurant that I will eagerly give them a second chance.  Maybe the Chicken Fried Steak next time."}
{"text":"I cannot begin to say enough great things about The Cracked Egg. I think the first thing that I should start with is the fact that after a three year absence from regular visits, I was surprised to see so many familiar faces. The food is always so good here - breakfast or lunch and the friendly staff just adds to that, \"I'm know I'm going to return\" fact. My favorite part of The Cracked Egg is by far and wide the coffee cake! It's so good!!! Make sure to sign up for their rewards program to get offers and coupons. A great local restaurant that should not be missed."}
{"text":"So this is only 1 of 2 of The Cracked Egg locations that I have tried.   I have to say it's not a very warm and welcoming feeling when you walk in, we were seated by a hostess that didn't look to sure about what she was doing.  Got our drinks right away by a really nice guy. Ordered our food from the waitress shortly after that. It wasn't very crowded and she came back to the table to double check about something we had ordered.  The food was ok, it was as ordered but some of their stuff is very bland. Burnt toast.  Overall a decent place for the price and amount of food you get, I think I just prefer other locations rather than this one."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on Saturday, and wow. I actually asked the manager if someone's mom was back there cooking. The food was delicious. They even make their scrambled eggs with cream cheese just like I do. I think I'm in love!   There was a 15 minute wait when I went on Saturday, so today I opted for the takeout. Since everyone was ordering the chicken fried steak, I figured I'd give that a go. It was so good! Crispy and smothered in naughty, rich gravy. It also came with scrambled eggs and hashbrowns plus a delicious piece of coffee cake that I shared with a co-worker.   Up until now I thought Farmer Boys was the big thing for breakfast. They now have some stiff competition!"}
{"text":"Over prices food with little taste. The hash browns are mushy and the corned beef hash had absolutely no flavor. They also charged $3.75 for a small cup of orange juice. Very disappointed in this breakfast. On the upside the customer service was decent."}
{"text":"Family owned and absolutely delicious!  They have lots of different items to choose from on their menu. I plan to be a regular here and am so happy that I found this place.  The service here is friendly, fast AND accurate."}
{"text":"Ordering whites-only omelet and fruit instead of potatoes should hint you that I eat healthy. There is no need to soak my Denver omelet in oil and cover it with cheese (not listed on the description).  Sorry that I didn't mention that I don't get my toast with lard (or was it butter?). Yes, I promise to let you know beforehand and not inconvenience you.  An omelet and a kindergarten-sized cup of OJ for $15? Really?"}
{"text":"Our breakfast was great!  We tried a little bit of everything. I was hoping the Monte Cristo would have been more filling compared to other restaurants but the flavor was perfect!   The wait was longer than estimated, but they finally squeezed us into a booth. Service was not the greatest but it was a busy Sunday.."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. The weather was perfect so asked to be sat in the patio area l. The food was good and service was fast."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this place was amazing.  We ordered carry out from this place and I got the tuna melt which was AMAZING.  It has hard boiled egg in it which was different but actually really good.  My boyfriend had the croissant french toast with fresh berries and it was sooooo good!  We will definitely be back.  We have small kids so it isn't always convenient to eat out so ordering out is the best option and this place was great, they included everything that we were going to need for our meal."}
{"text":"Lovely service and yummy food.  I ordered the egg white/turkey scramble with seasoned potatoes and coffee cake.  All were very tasty.  The coffee cake *may* be made from a mix....tasted like a mix cake, but I scarfed it down anyway.  Great place for a casual, fun breakfast/brunch/lunch!"}
{"text":"I've lived on the same side of town as this restaurant for the past 4 years and this was the first time I have tried it.  Boy was I missing out because the food was amazing!  I had a hard time choosing, but I settled on the Tropical French toast, three large slices of texas toast, battered and fried, topped with toasted coconut, macadamia nuts and bananas and served with a side of syrup.  My husband got a Monte Cristo which is a turkey, ham and swiss sandwich dipped in french toast batter and deep fried.  He also got a side of seasoned potatoes.  The service was great too and we can't wait to go back.  Maybe we'll even bring the kids with us next time."}
{"text":"We like this place. Nice menu and good food. I got the sunrise special which was just right for a smaller meal."}
{"text":"Great food. Busy place. Omelettes are huge and we should have split 1.  Good night place for breakfast."}
{"text":"The best breakfast on this side of valley.  Friendly staff, clean tables excellent coffee.  Always crowded but that proves their greatness. My wife loves the coffee cake.  I have a passion for the corned beef. Bring your appetite and plan on taking some of it home. Very full plates."}
{"text":"At 1st look, I said, \"Hmmnnnnn shall I dare?\" Then I was greeted with an amazing waitress (Raven) and I asked for her recommendations for the Best Omelette.  She called out \"Poncho!\"    *FOGETABOUTIT!!!*  I'm a Fan."}
{"text":"Breakfast too start the day not really in my vocabulary. BUT breakfast after any brick day or workout day nothing better for recovery meal. At The Cracked Egg not only do they offer great breakfast options can order lunch at the same time. I have been too another one of their property on my side of town. Always had great experience from the food, service, and one of my favorite go too breakfast restaurants.   I ordered \"The Enchilada\" omelette. Instead of toast ALWAYS go for the coffee cake. The coffee cake no matter which one they offer (on this day think was cherry) not only is it fresh, steamy hot, moist, and nice BiG size piece. Awesome that you can substitute your toast for coffee cake! The seasoned potatoes so addicting really could go carb crazy have whole plate of it. I love the seasoning not sure what it is except perfect blend, just want too keep eating them, and perfect compliment with anything eggs or in my case omelette. The Enchilada lot of stuff going on inside the omelette. The enchilada sauce felt like that made all the ingredients come together in perfect harmony. Top off the omelette with the cheese. One of the better omelette ever had for breakfast. The portion size does not end with the coffee cake. Between the omelette and the generous amount of seasoned potato hearty and leave stuffed.   The restaurant is much bigger in size then the one that closer on my side of town. It had more open air feeling too it cause of the size. The interior has the same vibe as the other location. Truly most important is the food is consistent with other location. Great breakfast/lunch spot!!!!! Our server was awesome the whole time staying on top of everything from our drinks and making sure everything going well.   Not often in Henderson but no doubt if in the area need too get my breakfast fix in The Cracked Egg is the spot. I looked forward too the next visit!"}
{"text":"The service was fine, the atmosphere was good.  I would not have even bothered to write a review, except the food made me sick.  Two hours after having a South Shore Scramble, it came back up.  Naturally, I'm pretty annoyed about it and wanted to share.  Hopefully this can be inspiration for TCE to evaluate it's food supply and prep."}
{"text":"Best breakfast joint in Summerlin! Reasonably priced and the menu is strong! Only downside, if there is one... place gets packed! But thats a GOOD sign, yeah?Ask for Victoria!"}
{"text":"Okay, I am not a huge breakfast person, but I feel there are better options around. I know everyone likes this place so remember, this is just my preference.   Girlfriend and I went on a Sunday morning, waited less than 10 minutes for a table. Our waitress was not not great, she spent more time socializing with her friends/family in the booth near us.   We both ordered biscuits and gravy, cause we love it and we were really disappointment, the gravy had no flavor, part of my biscuit was cold.   I would not go back because of the other options in the area, but I never say never."}
{"text":"The food at this place was great! I took my family from out of town here for breakfast and they loved it. Really great food and not overly expensive. The bus boy was also incredibly nice and so attentive.  The only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars is because our server seemed bothered  every time we asked for something. When we asked for more ketchup she snatched it from us without saying anything and then came back and slammed it on the table. She was also clearly annoyed when we asked her to split the check 2 ways.  Great food, but the server could have been friendlier."}
{"text":"Traditional American breakfast place with decent prices. Definitely go for the side of potatoes instead of hash browns. Coffee cake is light and their coffee is good. Portions are huge. If you're in town, this is a safe bet and can accommodate large parties. With a party of 6 we only had to wait 5 minutes or so on a Saturday morning. Not too shabby."}
{"text":"I had the croissant French toast topped with fresh berries and bananas. That was really, really, good. It was so unique. My friend had the peanut butter stuffed French toast which wasn't so good. Too much peanut butter, it stuck to the roof of my mouth. The coffee was weak like they are trying to save money on coffee grounds. Don't waste your money on coffee here!         Their coffee cake that comes with some of their breakfast entrees left something to be desired. It tasted ok but was too dry. I liked the chocolate chips in them though but still too dry for me. Hey chef - add some sour cream to the batter. It would help with the texture!         My BF had the Joe's scramble with hash browns. The scramble was really good but the hash browns were ok.          All in all I thought this place was ok. The service was good and I would go back just to get the croissant French toast. It was sooooo good! It beats going to an IHOP any day."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, friendly people and FAST service.  I was surprised to find so many items on the menu.  Came here for a late breakfast and it was busy but didn't have to wait anymore than 5 minutes.  I would return again."}
{"text":"NOT much of breakfast eater but my cousin from Sac in town and decided too meet up with my brother and my nieces at their favorite breakfast joint. I have been too few times just never got around too reviewing it. One thing really like about The Cracked Egg location so close too the house plus if this one busy then go five min down the road too there free standing restaurant. (I never been). It kind of small place so depending when you go there chance wait. We all meet up on weekend and good thing went early because by 10am the place was insane and line out the door. Go early or late breakfast/lunch crowds not your thing.   The Coffee Cake the bomb. I went with chili cheese omelette. It was really good! It had right portion of chili and cheese. The seasoned potatoes without doubt MY FAVORITE things on the menu. Sure you seasoned potatoes at any breakfast joint but the thing stands out for me is the seasoning mix they put on them. I have no idea it is. All I know is potatoes are addicting could eat plate of potatoes be in complete bliss. I put some ketchup on them but really tasty eat them by themselves. They nice HOT. Crispy on the outside. I also had the sandwiches on the menu are solid and makes for great breakfast/lunch. One thing after spoiling myself with Red Velvet Pancakes at BabyStack wish they had some too. It one type of pancakes they don;t have but have other yummy options comes too pancakes. Everything on the menu is solid had few things on the menu and loved it!  The service had always been great! Even when its super busy the service always been great, staff if very friendly, and great way too start the day with meal at The Cracked Egg. =))"}
{"text":"This place is great!  I have been there for both lunch and breakfast.  Food is larger portion and great.  As everyone has said, the coffee cake is to die for.  Service is good.  Never had a bad time here for meals or service."}
{"text":"Consistently very good. I wanted to try something different and this time I went for the pesto scramble. I normally get pancakes or French toast . Now I don't think ill ever order anything else. I personally can't eat eggs without tobacco and I was able to eat the pesto scramble plain.  Defiantly wanting to go back soon"}
{"text":"I've made two trips here. First time with my husband, we came on a Saturday morning and sat outside. I got Tori's tortilla with turkey sausage subbed for the chorizo. I got the coffee cake which was good..I was expecting something denser but it was super light-textured. Another  yelper suspected a cake mix but I bake a lot and it seemed house-made legit. My husband got French toast and eggs...I had a bite of his French toast and it was good. My burrito was excellent...packed with veggies and scrambled eggs and cheese...I was super happy they have green Tabasco too.   Second visit was with my mom on a weekday morning. We were seated quickly and were soon drinking coffee. We both ordered a special - sweet potato skillet with cranberry sausage and eggs. We also got coffee cake. Like the first time it was super fluffy and had a good flavor but I'll just get toast next time and save some calories for eggs and cheese ;)  Skillets were good...I would have preferred more veggies and fewer sweet potatoes but I am a big veggie fan so take that Into account. I would have also liked something more acidic thrown into the mix so I ended up asking for my fave green tabasco again.   Service was good, nice variety and good quality of ingredients. Next time I plan to try lunch.  They offer coupons every month on their website but make sure you check that out before you go as they need to be printed."}
{"text":"I have lived in this neighborhood for about 20 years and have eaten here when it was Fast Eddies. I never really liked that restaurant, but I'm a breakfast guy and with the change, I wanted to try it. The service was good and they took my order very quickly. I love chorizo and eggs and I'm very particular about how they prepare the chorizo. This was the best chorizo I've had. It was crispy, not greasy and had the perfect amount of spice. Best I've had anywhere! Also to top it off, they had French vanilla creamer to go with my coffee. I'm very particular about that as well. I'm excited to try another dish on my next visit."}
{"text":"The coffee cake is awesome. I think it was pumpkin raisin bread. Not sure if that is their regular coffee cake or if its a seasonal cake. I went twice to the same location. The first time I tried their Southwest Scramble, menu said chorizo and jalapeño. Sounded pretty good at the time. It was ok, not what I expected...Not much chorizo and the jalapeños were the pickled kind, wasn't expecting pickled jalapeño with eggs, but it wasn't bad.....you get a nice portion of potatoes. The second time I went back I ordered your simple bacon and eggs, I was less impressed the second time around. My food was barely warm. The servings were a little skimpier this time, but the coffee cake was still the best part. I may go back, but probably won't be a regular spot.....still searching for that perfect breakfast place."}
{"text":"This place gets only 1star as well because of the waitress was nice. One of the hostess as we walked in was rude and did not even smile. I commented for her to smile, the more she gave me this dagger look. We were excited about this new place but with what happened, it will be a while for the next visit."}
{"text":"Just landed in Las Vegas at 6am, finally checked into our hotel room, and boy were we hungry!! So of course, we jumped on Yelp in search for a good breakfast place :)  Finally we founds The Cracked Egg on Yelp. I was super excited because breakfast is my favorite meal of the day!   The Grub. [[ CLASSIC EGGS BENEDICT $10.25 ]] http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cracked-egg-las-vegas-2#_JzB5Wo5TQvPGwzEXxZZ4w This Benedict comes on a grilled English muffin, Canadian bacon and two poached eggs smothered in hollandaise sauce!  [[ COUNTRY BENEDICT $11.40 ]] http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cracked-egg-las-vegas-2#k7ucRnegPlLeKZ6F1iDl3g The Benedict comes on a biscuit split and topped with patty sausage, two poached eggs and smothered in gravy!

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"I love breakfast.  I particularly love breakfast when someone else makes it for me - enter diner breakfasts!  We've been going to this location of the Cracked Egg sporadically for nearly 10 years now.  I started off always having their solid eggs and turkey sausage plate, but now that my diet is more plant strong these days, this time I opted for the Veggie Skillet - and I'm sooooo glad I did!  Fresh broccoli, mushrooms and spinach sauteed and served over the Cracked Egg's signature seasoned potatoes - topped with two eggs over easy. I requested no cheese - and didn't miss it at all.  So fresh and so good!    One thing I was happy to see was that the wait was much shorter than I remember for a Sunday - about 10 minutes. I have a feeling that's due to more breakfast options opening in the area.   We tried to go to Babycakes but they had an hour and fifteen minute wait!  Bad for fans of Babycakes, good for fans of the Cracked Egg!"}
{"text":"Consistently we have had excellent service and the food is delicious. It's my family's favorite breakfast and brunch restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food. Service a little slow but not a big deal. They are at least nice. I come for the food."}
{"text":"This place is a perfect mixed of down home and modern west. The breakfast options were your classics with some staff originals. I love there scrambles. The portions are smaller than most breakfast places and their prices a little higher but over all I had a great experience and differently recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I mean, REALLY, the coffee cake is enough to get my mouth watering.   I had breakfast here AGAIN this morning with my friend and once again, I was thoroughly impressed.   Today's coffee cake: apple. The waitress said it was cherry, but it was apple. And it was AMAZING. Warm, soft, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. I can't get enough. I would come here for the coffee cake alone.   I'm a simple breakfast eater: I eat eggs over easy with toast, hash browns, turkey sausage, and a side of avocado. That's it.   My friend ordered the sweet potato skillet - not something I would usually order. But, I snuck a bite from her plate and OHMYGOODNESS: FLAVOR EXPLOSION. Sweet potatoes with onions and apples and muenster cheese and bacon and eggs? All of the things you'd never expect in a skillet, but when combined to make the perfect bite, produce the most epic of flavors.   I will return. As usual. For more coffee cake. And to order the sweet potato skillet."}
{"text":"Hadn't been in a long time, but nothing has changed. The food and service were still very good. I like the atmosphere, location and many breakfast choices. I personally like the eggs Benedict as well as the oatmeal overload."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for a quick breakfast before heading to Hoover Dam. We had the following:  The Veggie Skillet with Corned Beef $10.90  The Sweet Potato Skillet $10.50  Coconut and macadamia nut pancakes $8.95  My veggie skillet was pretty good. I loved the mix of broccoli, mushrooms, spinach and tomatoes with the fried potatoes (and meat of course). My wife gave her skillet 6/10 bc she said her potatoes were not so crispy. I wouldn't recommend the pancakes as the coconut is not fresh coconut but coconut from a prepackaged bag. That kind of coconut is too sweet and with added syrup made the dish too sweet for my tastebuds. The one good aspect here is that the skillets came with their signature coffee cake (or toast if u prefer). Their coffee cake was pretty good. The texture was so light and soft and way better than Starbucks. After 4 or 5 bites however, it does becomes a little too sweet so I suggest sharing one with another person."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots in all of Las Vegas! Every item I have tried has been fantastic. Definitely would recommend going here."}
{"text":"I love nearly everything about this place! I always make sure to get the coffee cake and I have enjoyed all of the different kinds they come up with, although the fruit ones have been the best by far! Everything I have tried has been good and my parents love to come here when they visit from out of state. My only complaint is one staff member that has continually hit on me when visiting. It doesn't matter where I sit, that I completely ignore him, that I am in the middle of taking a bite of food... the awkward conversation is forced on me even after claiming a boyfriend and not interested. Management should be clear on things like this happening with employees while they are working."}
{"text":"Just ok. Overpriced, slow service and questionable portions."}
{"text":"The coffee cake is delicious, no doubt. Yesterday morning I had the carnitas omelet. Very bland and very light on the 'carnitas' part. Not my favorite meal here. Will not be back anytime soon. Can definitely find better and similarly-priced (if not cheaper) breakfast eats in town."}
{"text":"We had to take my car into the shop early on Saturday morning so we considered grabbing some breakfast in the area as well.  After checking my Yelp! bookmarks - I was happy to be reminded of the newer Centennial location of the Cracked Egg as we'd been going to the original Cheyenne location on and off for about 8 years now.  This location is a lot less crowded with a shorter wait time and a much larger seating area - all decorated in a traditional country-kitsch motif.  I liked the fact that they have enough room to set the tables further apart here, it makes the space feels much more open and airy.  I'm a big fan of the Cracked Egg's Veggie Benny and it was equally as great here.  Two English muffins topped with spinach, poached eggs and hollandaise please - diet be damned!  I prefer my breakfast with hash browns rather than fried potatoes and they do a good job here - taking the time to let the outside get all nice and crispy while the inside remains soft and buttery (if there's one thing that makes me sad, it's undercooked hash browns).  The service was friendly, welcoming and efficient.  I'd definitely come back to this location again, even if it is a little farther from my house - just for the shorter wait."}
{"text":"Always a stellar time! The 'Cheers' of the breakfasts joints, the awesome service is only outdone by the delicious menu. On the menu today: -Joes scramble with hash brows  - Big Bad Wolf with hash browns  Both entrees come with a side of the most delicious warm and moist coffee cake of my life!!   Select main entrees have a choice of toast or coffee cake, always choose coffee cake. Lol :)   With indoor and outdoor seating available the resteraunt is always clean, the service is always incredible and the food is always worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Why is food in Summerlin so terrible! Well, it's not terrible, it's just the same crap other restaurants are serving. For example, there is another breakfast place I can't remember the name of (i think Egg was also in the title) that uses the same potatoes as this place, meaning they all get it from the same vendor. The waitress was really pushing us on these crappy, frozen potatoes that looked like they came from Vons. The meals are big portions and ready to give you a heart attack. I just wish the food here wasn't so bland and unoriginal. I like diner food, but jeez, don't serve me the same stuff as every other schlup in Vegas."}
{"text":"Tried this place for breakfast today and it was great! Our waiter was friendly which we appreciated as good service is hard to come by these days! We will definitely be back when we are in town!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast spot! We were in town for a soccer tournament and dropped by here for a late breakfast. 15 minute wait at 10:30 on. Friday morning was a good sign. Great service. Great food. One star off for the pancakes being a little too chewy instead of fluffy and melty like I think they should be. But 5 stars for the Sweet Potato skillet. Like the best version of breakfast raclette."}
{"text":"This is my second time at the Cracked Egg (Henderson Location) and the first time all I could remember was the fact that the food was delicious; hence my desire to make a return trip.  Walking in to the restaurant with my mom we were greeted by the cashier and told the wait would be 5 minutes; no problem. When my name was shouted (as if there was a fire mind you), the \"hostess\" snatched the silverware and menus and raced off to the table.  She did not so much as look back to see if we were following her, nor did she even say anything to us as we were seating ourselves. Why? Oh yeah, that's because she was already back at the hostess stand before we even pulled our own chairs out.  This atrocious moment in customer service left an extremely sour taste in my mouth prior to even being helped by our server; who's service was also sub par.  Thankfully the food was the only redeeming quality and the friendly cashier guy.   I thoroughly enjoy the eats at the Cracked egg however we will not be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"OK I like the place too.  But let's not go crazy.    The eggs are fresh, but they also seem to shy away from actually seasoning anything.  My egg sandwich (i forget their cute name for it) was good.  Bigger than it needed to be and served on a croissant.  They really should grill that croissant a little so it doesn't get so soggy.  The seasoned potatoes are good, but could be hotter in my opinion.  The biggest problem with this place is the service.  After waiting for your table you are greeted by a server who seems entirely overburdened.  There is certainly no passion and for me that kind of ruins things for me.  After I wait 30 minutes for a table, I am excited to sit down and eat.  Having the serve kill that excitement is just disappointing.  Also, this is not the cleanest place I have eaten.  the booths are dirty and the place seems a little dingy.  The toilet was broken... but no one from the restaurant knew... nor when I told them.. did anyone care.  That's sort of how I feel.  I don't really care about this place and I think my days of waiting for a table here have come to an end."}
{"text":"This place doesn't know the meaning \"first come, first serve.\" My boyfriend and I waited for about 35 mins for our order to be taken. Three to four tables were already sat after us. Two of them got their order taken before us then another customer came in and sat down at the counter. We were patiently waiting until someone could notice us waiting at our table. After maybe 10 mins, I noticed the customer sitting at the counter already had her meal in front of her while four tables including us never got our meal yet. I've worked in a restaurant before, I know how everything works. No matter how small a meal is it doesn't come out until the first table that orders gets their meal first. The waitress even tried giving us an excuse on the customers meal that came out before any of ours. Overall the situation just made the experience at his location pretty bad."}
{"text":"Huuge fan of the Cracked Egg!  I've gone on weekend and weekday mornings.  Weekday mornings aren't too bad, but weekend days can have quite the wait sometimes (30-40 mins).  I either get the California omelette or the mexican skillet, depending on my mood.  Both are just too delicious.  I love their seasonsed potatoes!  Their portions are more than enough for me, unless I'm absolutely starving.  This is so much better than your Dennys and IHOPs.  Fresh and a wide variety of food, and the prices aren't bad at all.  The toast always has plenty of butter, and their coffee cake is yummy as well.  I've been here more than I count, and it never gets old."}
{"text":"Stopped by here because on a rare occasion, I felt like having breakfast.  The service was pretty slow though, the food was really good though, a little better than the ordinary.  Had the eggs benedict, good hollandaise sauce and the eggs were perfectly poached."}
{"text":"Its always superr busy when we go have breakfast here, so just be prepared to wait a little. The coffee wasnt all that great. I really like their potatoes here. The seasoning on them is delicious. The pancakes were really good just also really expensive. For two people our bill was $36 bucks."}
{"text":"This is THE spot for breakfast in Vegas and I am a frequent flyer- you'll typically catch me here on a Saturday/Sunday once a week chowing down on a country benny.  I don't need a menu!  Seriously, you've gotta order their country benny.  The yolks are perfect and creamy (I'm salivating thinking of it now- it's almost pornographic!) thanks to a perfect cook every time!  The gravy has just the right amount of sausage, plus no paprika or green chiles or any other weird additions that you'll find in other breakfast joints.  The biscuits are always fluffy (once I had rock hard biscuits and they replaced them immediately) and I just love the rich combination of yolk, gravy, biscuit, and sausage.  I wish they were open 24/7, but I'm saving more money by only going in the mornings.  The coffee cake is fresh baked and always delicious.  I've never tried any of the cream cheese types, though (no thanks).  I've sampled some other things on the menu, but only when my boyfriend orders because I just cannot part from my one true love, the country benny.  I love you, Cracked Egg.  It's an unhealthy obsession, but the tongue and stomach wants what it wants."}
{"text":"My teacher friend said she LOVES The Cracked Egg, so I stopped in last weekend.  All of the reviews on yelp say you should try the coffee cake... I say you should skip it!  It's more plain cake than it is the topping (aka, the part we all love).  Also, know that you cannot request a flavor.  I ordered the Country Benny and it was savory and satisfying.  The sausage gravy had great texture (not too thick/not too runny) and flavor, which is difficult to find on this side of the country!  The biscuits were soft and the egg was cooked perfectly.  I wasn't impressed by the seasoned potatoes, but after eating the main entree, I didn't have much room for them, anyway.  My companion ordered the Mexican skillet and seemed to enjoy it- I didn't try it, so I can't comment.  I would visit again, but I definitely think I'll skip the coffee cake next time!"}
{"text":"We've come here many times and I get the same thing every time, what I specifically come here for...the cordon bleu skillet. It's amazing! They took it off the menu, but if you're going in looking for it and mention it to your server, you can still order it. My boyfriend has tried other meals and he's never had anything bad to say about any of them. If you are getting a meal that lets you choose between I think toast or the coffee cake, definitely choose the cake. It's delicious!! You won't be disappointed. It is sweet though so be prepared for that. They have different flavors throughout the year and they've all been really good. It does get really busy, especially on the weekends so make sure you plan ahead to wait a bit. On a positive note tho, even when the place was packed, after ordered, we got our food super fast."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Just a few minutes off the strip and it was worth the drive. The service was good, much more relaxed yet still friendly which I appreciated. The service was super quick and the food was delicious! I loved the country benny, definitely a must order."}
{"text":"So yummy! We came because Mr. Mama had a 45 min wait and it was only a 15 min wait here... Long enough for us to look at the menu and make our selection.   Our server, Liz, was so friendly and if we had won at the casino we would've tipped more, but we gave her a 30% tip.   French toast was ok, but the coffee cake was sooooo yummy!   California omlet had a half avocado, which was more than I expected. Perfectly ripe and wish I had taken a pic!  Season potatoes were perfect, no ketchup necessary.   We plan in returning every time we come to Vegas and tell everyone we know!"}
{"text":"Loooove The Cracked Egg!  My go-to breakfast place EVERY time.  You get coffee cake or toast with your breakfast dish... the coffee cake is usually phenomenal!  It's just dependent upon my mood.  They've had the same people working there for a while now and now that I think of it... I don't believe I've EVER had a bad experience with my service.  Whether that be waiting on refills, waiting on food, the way I was treated.  I know most people love hash browns... but TRY the seasoned potatoes!  They are amazing!  Sooo good, the seasoning is to die for... a great addition to any dish.  I've tried skillets, omelettes, scrambles, sandwiches.... and have never been disappointed.  The only time I didn't absolutely looove something was when it wasn't something that I normally wouldn't go for anyway.  All in all, it's definitely worth checking out if you have never been here."}
{"text":"As much as it pains me to admit it, I was wrong. I was going through life thinking that the best eggs benedict in town could be found at the Peppermill. Oh how wrong I was!  Given that it's right down the street, Boyfriend and I decided to give The Cracked Egg a shot. Our 5 minute wait to be seated was great for 10:30 on a Saturday morning. Once seated, our drink order was taken almost immediately; actual drinks followed shortly. We ordered about 5 minutes after being seated. Twenty minutes later, food arrived! I had the traditional benedict. Boyfriend had the country benedict. I was floored by how delicious my food was. The eggs were wonderfully runny, the hollandaise was excellent and the Canadian bacon was smokey with no gristly bits. My side of hashbrowns was very tasty. Always a plus when there's enough egg yolk and hollandaise to dredge hashbrowns in!   Service was quick and friendly. Food is seriously good, if slightly on the pricey side ($32, including tip, for two people). This probably won't be a weekly spot, but we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to come for an awesome breakfast!! It's off the strip and had a warm feel. The staff is friendly and accommodating. Get the Coffee Cake!! It is a must have...You're welcome! I would definitely come back when I return to Vegas. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Was on vacation from Chicago looking for a place to eat while we were driving around exploring found the cracked egg very impressed food fresh and good when we return to Las Vegas will definitely go there again for breakfast. Server recommended a couple dishes she was spot on on everything she recommended"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place! We have been coming since they opened. We used to travel to the Rainbow location until they opened this one up near where we live. The food is delicious! They have the best eggs benedict in town and I have tried almost everything in the breakfast menu and everything is great! The atmosphere is great and they have a great staff! Love the service!"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place! We have been coming since they opened. We used to travel to the Rainbow location until they opened the one up near where we live in north las vegas. The food is delicious! They have the best eggs benedict in town and I have tried almost everything in the breakfast menu and everything is great! The atmosphere is great and they have a great staff! Love the service!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a new favorite breakfast spot. My wife's favorite breakfast is eggs benedict, so unsurprisingly she ordered the California Eggs Benedict. The poached eggs were served on top of an English muffin with fresh avocado on the side and hollandaise to top the eggs off. The house fries were their version of hash browns.   I had a little more trouble deciding, as I usually try to taste new things. After much deliberation I decided on the El Patron Skillet. This cosists of a bed of country potatoes, cheese, chorizo, pickled jalapenos, and eggs done your way (I ordered mine scrambled). Salsa and sour cream are served on the side. You also get a choice of tortilla, toast, English muffin, or biscuit. I decided on the biscuit, which was huge!  My wife was pleasantly happy with her breakfast. Not many places do eggs Benedict to her liking, though she is not too picky. As for me, everything was delicious! The biscuit was not as fluffy as I hoped but nonetheless it was good.   The service was awesome. From the minute we went into the establishment, which resembles an old diner, everyone smiled and welcomed us without making it awkward. We felt their friendliness and overall attitude was genuine. We will definitely be coming back to this place. Thanks for the great food and service."}
{"text":"Very fast, fresh and awesome food. I ordered Toris Burrito and loved every bite! I highly recommend this place! The next time Im going to order the crosiant!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a serial optimist.  Maybe I have to go in to an eatery with a more neutral mind.  I had pretty high expectations for a place that has the word egg in their restaurant name.  I imagined pretty big egg portions for the price.  Alas, it was not.  I had the Northshore scrambler, lots of filler stuff mixed in the egg and it tasted good but if only it were, say, a little bit bigger...maybe by another inch?.  With the Northshore you have a choice of hash browns for diced potatoes.  For some reason, my potatoes arrived cold.  Well, maybe that's overstated.  But, it wasn't hot like my eggs.  Perhaps it's cooked in bulk and left i an aluminum tray.  I also tried the Croissant French Toast with berries.  I'm expecting something way better than IHOP.  The bread was hard upon arrival and it was also cold.  About half the blueberries where sour and half the strawberries were as well. I'm thankful they give you lots of syrup to drown it out.  The highlight of the meal is the nice warm coffee cake that several reviewers state is awesome.  Yes, it is.  I wanted another slice.   The staff are prompt and courteous and checked on us frequently. I like that since it started to get busy as soon as we arrived and server attentiveness usually goes down as the number of customers increase.  We tend to bring a crowd soon after we  arrive, not cause we're famous or even know these people who follow us.  We just seem to be one of Murphy's Laws.  Whether we are at a drive thru at Jack In The Box or in line at the M casino buffett....geez.  Will I go back again? Yes, but it won't be my first choice on my mind."}
{"text":"Coffee cake is amazing. Hash browns were great. Do not have Mexican food here if you know what real Mexican food tastes like. Waffles are the thing here. Coffee is great. Good service."}
{"text":"The wait was only 20 minutes for a Sunday morning, which was better than I expected. The food was delicious with lots of vegetarian options. The service was fast and friendly and my coffee cup was never left empty! I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"First time.  Very nice place.  Got in pretty fast on a Saturday morning.  Got busy shortly after.  Reminded me of an old 70's Bob's Big Boy.    There is a back built-on area, booths and tables with TV's on walls.  Kid Friendly.   Menu is HUGE.  I don't mean as in items, I mean HUGE.... like a foot and a half long. Food was tasty!  Unfortunately, I was super dehydrated from a kick-butt concert the night before and wasn't able to eat much.  I will have to go back when I'm in town again, just to sit at the counter!  ;)  We had an awesome, fun & friendly server.  Easy Parking."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here because it was a nice stroll down from my house - the neighborhood feel was great - and it was sure busy!  We got seated immediately at a two top, although the weather was lovely enough to sit outside. The menu averages as a basic breakfast and lunch place with a traditional coffee cake offered as a side.   My boyfriend ordered a classic eggs & bacon which is served with toast and potatoes and I was split between the Ole Benedict and chili skillet, choosing the latter. The food came out quick and hot within 5 minutes!   Our waitress was decent if you include the business of the restaurant. Helpful and gave us attention when needed. Overall the food was great, enough cheese to satisfy the best fanatics. But nothing over the top in quality to make me a regular.  It's nice that it's close in the neighborhood as walking distance but I'll probably go back in a few months if I get a craving. 3/5"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast joint. Beginning with the unpretentious decor, the Cracked Egg delivers a modern throwback to a time when having breakfast was a community event. Please wait to be seated, gives you the opportunity to take everything in and reflect back to a simpliar era.  Clean and comfortable booths with tables for larger crowds. I found myself still wanting to sit at the counter stools like I did as a child in a drug store soda fountain.  I saved the best for last. The food is by far the best diner food for the price. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I am a breakfast guy and this is my kind of place. It is a one off restaurant that opens at 6 AM and serves GOOD food!   I like to find a place that has corned beef hash that is home made. None of that stuff from a can. Most places will tell me when I ask if it is home made. Well at this place it is the real deal. I will put this place on the go to breakfast place when we are visiting friends in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great  breakfast spot... I had a slight issue with my breakfast and the staff where friendly and fixed the issue immediately. They even brought the chef out so he could see.   Absolutely great customer service food was great and all staff where extremely friendly and professional... I will definitely return and recommend this to my friends."}
{"text":"1- kudos for not making it weird that I am a female eating breakfast alone. So many places are so confused when you do this.   2- Coffee was hot. Not tepid, warm, hot. Delicious and hot  3- I got chicken fried steak because, well, I'm on a kick. Hopefully, I break it soon because it's not the best breakfast on the health list, but man, it's sooo good.   4- Price was reasonable, speed was good, and food was delicious.   They have a good menu to choose from with some different items. Normally I try more stuff, but when I get on a kick, nothing can stop me :D It is worth coming in for a nice good breakfast. Friendly staff and I will be back for some other menu items."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The service was friendly and prompt. The food options were plenty. The coffee was great and the waitress was not shy about refills. I got the Bubba Gump omelet and my hubby got the volcano. Bring your appetite! He's a big guy and couldn't finish the meal. I voluntarily participated in gluttony because I hate that hollandaise sauce separates when it is reheated. We have been in town a few days and have been striking out on my yelping. This was a win for our late breakfast. I guess if I'm going to get picky I should explain why not 5 stars. My second round of coffee wasnt hot so it kinda killed my coffee momentum and my pancakes were a needing a bit more syrup and were slightly tough around the corners. However... That's just me being picky. We will eat here again the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars!  The Cracked Egg is a quality breakfast spot!  The specialty is their homemade Coffee Cake that rotates through a variety of flavors.  Most are great!  The owners are also incredibly nice, and truly put the customer first.  With several enjoyable entree options, the Cracked Egg is a place I will gladly go for breakfast.  I usually end up with the Benedict Ole, Southwest Scramble, or Cracked Croissant.  This is a great spot Monday - Friday...but can be crowded on the weekends for obvious reasons."}
{"text":"Been to this location many times (and the S. Rainbow as well). Attentive and friendly service. If with a regular customer, the waitstaff pretty much already knows what they want. Food arrives in a timely manner.  Overall, everything I've ordered has been tasty. Large portions. The spicier dishes (eg. anything with chorizo and or green chile) are too mild for my tastes, but like that there is the option to have something with some non-Anglo flair. The coffee cake I had as my \"toast\" option on this past visit was a bit of a disappointment: taste and consistency of something that came out of a Betty Crocker box.  Nice breakfast place. And if you go on a regular basis, don't forget to sign-up for their loyalty program to get discounts on future meals."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfasts.  We go to the Centennial Las Vegas restaurant often.  I particularly like the Torie Tortilla!"}
{"text":"I went to The Cracked Egg with my wife and father in law for breakfast and had a fantastic meal.  While I'm not a big fan of coffee cake it was by far the best I've ever had.  The real surprise for me though was the potatoe skillet.  The potatoes were browned perfectly with bacon and scallions mixed in.  The service was very quick and the restaurant was surprisingly clean during the busy breakfast hour."}
{"text":"I've lived next to this place for 15 years & never thought to go inside until a friend invited me. To my surprise, it was a cute setting with motivational quotes on the wall & such friendly staff. Inside was clean & quiet. The food tasted great! I got the California omelette & a cup of coffee (not diluted w/ too much water). I recommend this place if you want a good & quiet breakfast!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Portions are huge! GLUTEN FREE HEAVEN! They have a great gf menu and I have been a couple times and never gotten sick! (Still be careful of course!) Everything is delicious they're gf muffins are to die for!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, excellent service, huge menu, senior menu, excellent coffee sold by the bag if you want, all my favorite sauces at the table, bright, clean, I loved it"}
{"text":"I don't care who you are, but you can't deny breakfast at random times of the day if it's offered to you. That's where The Cracked Egg is a blessing in disguise.   Your average diner atmosphere, choose among their filling and stuffed omelettes, salads, sandwiches and other breakfast options. (Tip: the pesto omelette is a pretty tasty and healthy post-breakfast dish that tastes less like brunch and is even more perfect for lunch.)   Did I mention their salads are huge? Yes, huge. So huge, in fact, that you may not want to finish it in one sitting unless you plan on unbuttoning somewhere or another.   As far as pricing goes, you'll dine on an affordable diner budget. Pay at the counter when you're through, and be thankful you could escape and pretend you're having a Sunday morning brunch instead of a weekday back-to-the-office lunch. Hey, it's what I did."}
{"text":"The most amazing breakfast EVER!  Comfortable, open-spaced cafe/diner atmosphere. Peanut butter french toast- enough said :)"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite breakfast place in all of Las Vegas.  I am so glad they have multiple locations now!  I've been eating here during my Vegas visits for quite a few years now.  I've never once had even a mediocre breakfast here- it's always fabulous!  Fast, comfortable seating, cheap but doesn't taste like it!  Apple filled french past us the bomb! They also have great turkey sausage, ripe avocado and sourdough toast for healthy add ons.    Kid friendly; no problems getting a clean high chair here and plenty of other kids in the restaurant...but still quiet enough for a serious chat if need be.  Lively but not crazy loud atmosphere.  Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"After reading all of the yelp reviews I was excited!  Location- It's located right off of the 215 and green valley in the smith's strip mall building. Lots of parking and easy to find.  Ambience- It's clean and simply decorated. Very open with booths and a small counter area to eat at.  Service- Considering we were the only table here I did expect more. Our server was friendly enough and provided efficient service. Can't complain.  Food- We ordered the Monte Cristo w/ hash browns, The Carnitas omelet w/potatoes and blueberry coffee cake, and chocolate pancakes w/ side of bacon. We all shared the coffee cake. It was moist and fresh but we all agreed that the blueberries did not compliment the coffee cake. My son enjoyed his Monte Cristo but said he wouldn't eat it again. My omelet was dry, flat, and tasteless. I did expect so much more. Maybe my food choices wasn't the best, but it was recommended by the server.   3 stars for being clean, decent service, having a great coffee cake recipe (subtract the blueberries), being reasonably priced, and having a good selection of items on the menu. It's not a bad place, it just wasn't for me."}
{"text":"Not sure where I should begin with this review, the 4 stars are a bit of a stretch. The service was very good and we were seated quickly. My eggs were cold, has browns were barley done and the pancakes were okay. The area were we were seated, the waitresses make toast/english muffins, thats's very different. This would NOT be my first choice for breakfast, lesson learned."}
{"text":"This is our #1, go to breakfast place! The food is always amazing, the wait is not usually too long, and the staff is absolutely incredible! I have never found a thing to complain about and we enjoy our visit every single time! They are timely, efficient, and well above average. We absolutely love our neighborhood breakfast place and will even stop by on occasion for lunch too! Thanks for being amazing, Cracked Egg!"}
{"text":"I work on S Rainbow near another \"Egg\" restaurant and had breakfast there every day I worked. I found The Cracked Egg with the help of Yelp. I went to try it even though it wasn't as convenient.  This place is awesome, first time was great but waited to try again. Service is great, friendly staff and food (both things I've tried) is tasty, well prepared and so many things to choose from. It's to the point that I'm looking forward to work because it starts with breakfast at The Cracked Egg. Food: Carnitas omelette.. A      Corned beef skillet.. A      Can't wait for my next item.. Oh, do yourself a favor and get the coffee cake.. Decedent.."}
{"text":"Good homestyle breakfast. You can tell by foot traffic it's a local favorite.  Diverse amount of items to order for all tastes.  Portions are on the large side,  so guaranteed to leave satisfied.  Scrambles, Omelettes, skillets and benedicts just to name a few."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people don't care about the ice in their drink, but having worked in a hospital where black specks in ice mean the ice machine needs cleaning I look at the ice here & it is absolutely crystal clear! Not only does clean ice taste better in your drink, it makes it colder. My husband will not take lemon in his tea because most people don't wash theirs, but here not only are lemons washed, so are the bananas etc. They use tongs when buttering the toast too! So many restaurants have kitchens that after seeing them you wouldn't want to eat there, but we enjoy sitting at the counter occasionally just to watch the smooth operations of a well kept, organized kitchen! Armando is the manager & will correct any problem you may have, if any! We eat here at least 2-3 times a week & thoroughly enjoy all the staff along with the delicious food. And don't forget to ask what the latest flavor of coffee cake is being served at the moment... delicious no matter what flavor!"}
{"text":"Nothing like getting treated nicely. It's got a nice family warmth to it. Great food and great customer service! Come try this place out!"}
{"text":"This is no tourist joint as it's way off the strip. What's great about this place is it has a buy 1 get 1 free coupon up to 10 dollars in value from the Las vVgas coupon book. Coffee is 2 dollars and 15 cents a cup. I had Luisa's scramble...3 eggs with sausage, peppers, onions, fresh shrooms, and melted Muenster cheese on top. Came with home fries which were like Ore-Ida, which I didn't care for that much. Also comes with choice of toast or cofee cake.   The scramble was big and tasty...I would get it again, but would try the hash browns instead of the potatoes/home fries. A bit pricey without the coupon at 9 dollars and 95 cents. This place is clean and the service was fine.   Pretty funny sign in the bathroom... see my picture. Overall a pretty decent experience but definitely kind of pricey without for a basic diner kinda place. They open at 6 amI and  you can sit wherever you want. They have tables, booths and a bar top."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Some of the menu reminds me of small town country cafés from Texas. I love the Country Benny. A great twist on poached eggs and biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"You like eggs? Do you crave everything egg?  Then why haven't you been to the cracked egg!?  The staff is friendly and helpful, the food is delicious, and the wait to be seating is like waiting for Christmas morning.   We had the coffee cake (which was a seasonal pumpkin cake), huevos rancheros, and the build your own skillet. I slurped up the huevos rancheros like it was the first meal I had in weeks. My wife enjoyed her skillet with the demeanor of royalty.  I'm sure it was quite a site for those around us.   Any way, great place with great food and great people.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Been coming here with family for years. Food is always delicious. But almost $4 for a small glass of OJ. I could have gotten a whole gallon for that price. Kinda crazy"}
{"text":"Only downside is it's always busy. We had to wait 20 minutes on a Saturday morning. Food is good, and service is great. We had Lisa and she checked in on us numerous times. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Worst omelette ..got California omelette..menu said fluffy omelets but mine was flat and only had bacon in half of omelette. Over priced for what I received. Waitress was nice but she never came back to see how my breakfast was"}
{"text":"Service is always amazing but today was extra special.. We slept in and woke up starving we didn't realize that it was almost 2pm (closing) we didn't even make it to the restaurant door when we decided to go back to the truck.. The manager on duty (light blue shirt didn't catch her name) ran out and grabbed us and invited us in! Food was amazing!! Chocolate chip banana coffee cake was great today!! Thanks to the whole staff! :)"}
{"text":"fresh coffee cake with your breakfast!  fast service very friendly good prices you really can't go wrong. love it here."}
{"text":"Great service (our server was Liz). Great prices. Food was very good too. Definitely recommend getting the coffee cake over the toast with your breakfast meal. Had the big bad wolf omelet and it was good. The seasoned potatoes were great too. French toast was cool, but I've has better. But overall this place is great. Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a hearty meal.  Like many reviewers added, this place is far enough off of the strip that you feel a little more relaxed while eating with the locals.  The menu is plentiful and there are many choices for all types of eaters.  The prices are also fair and the wait service is also super friendly.  We went around 11am on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend and had no problem being seated right away (party of 3).  If I had one complaint it would be about the coffee cake that everyone else raved about.  I wish that they had a variety to choose from per day vs. having a special cake each day.  When we went they had the cherry cream coffee cake and it was just okay.  It had a nice flavor but it was a bit undercooked which gave it a sticky feeling against the tongue.  The food and atmosphere were good enough so we'll definitely head back the next time we are in LV."}
{"text":"Yummy! This was a delicious! I had the veggie omelette and my husband had the poncho omelette, which is chorizo with pico, sour cream, and avocado. They were both very tasty! I ordered the home fries, he ordered the other potato. I liked the home fries best. Our waitress, Penny, had a great personality! She was warm and engaging. I am a huge fan of pancakes, these were fluffy and tasted almost nutty. I liked, but didn't love, them they tasted almost manufactured in a way, and looked too perfect. As if they had mean made by a machine and shipped in. I also didn't love the taste of the coffee, but I'm kind of a coffee snob. Overall it was a great experience the omelette and customer service was excellent, and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Rainy days = no lines! What a delicious way to spend my Sunday. The good was excellent and the service was amazing.  So many smiles as soon as you walk in the door. The enchilada omelet was great!!!"}
{"text":"Service was good, food was  average, will be hard to go back.  It's a typical old Fashion diner where the servers make the toast.   Our server coughed into her hand and immediately went over to make some toast without washing her hands          I witnessed no servers ever washing her hands while making toast.  We opted for the pancakes instead.    Owners need to come into the future and have cooks and servers wear gloves or wash hands to protect the health of the customers or quit touching the food."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and I have never been disappointed.  The only thing I have been disappointed in was the coffe cake. Although it is always warm, sometimes it seems like a lot of cake without moisture. However, today it had glazed fruit on the bottom that made it perfect.   I ordered The Greek omelet. It was a three egg omelet with spinach, tomatoes and Feta cheese. The edge of the eggs were a bit crisp but the ratio of vegetables to Feta cheese was perfect. The portion size was appropriate for the size and sent me home with leftovers.   I am not a fan of the seasoned potatoes as they are a bit bland and salty. I had hash browns instead. They seemed a bit under cooked.   Overall, you will have a positive dining experience. They even have a gluten free muffin now."}
{"text":"Crowded on weekend mornings, go expecting a wait outside. If you order eggs get no yokes, or whites or beaters because the real eggs are often iffy and will ruin your stomach for the day (not the freshest eggs).  On the plus side, the service is friendly and the hash browns are darn good."}
{"text":"This is our first time here, we will FOR SURE be back! The food is AWESOME,  atmosphere is very nice, clean and roomy seating."}
{"text":"Keeping this short. I am a fan of their scrambles and monte cristo. The food quality is better than babystacks. The service is solid as well. Even when they're incredibly busy, the food comes out in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"So good! I loved the eggs benny and the potatoes were seasoned perfectly. Service was great as well and I loved the coffee cake. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We love the staff here! We've been coming just about every Saturday and they always remember us/our names/our orders! Carol is so sweet to greet us when we walk in and when we leave: not just a general \"hello/good morning\" but something genuine.  The FOOD - you MUST get the seasoned potatoes! I've personally tried a variety of omelettes and all the other types of breakfast dishes and I've yet to have anything I didn't like. Ethan likes the \"Jayden\" off the kids menu, but he subs our the ham for bacon and no cheese. The kitchen staff always gets it just right and never makes us feel badly for customizing an order (thank goodness, bc kids are difficult at times!) haha.  This place is always busy, so don't be surprised! They seat you pretty quickly, so don't worry!"}
{"text":"My waitress Diane was amazing! She was quick to come take my order but didn't seem to bother when I asked for more time. She checked on myself and my 10-month-old often and had an amazing attitude. Just totally nice and pleasant! The food is good, but the customer service is the reason I keep coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"Cracked Egg gets my vote for the most underrated breakfast on the NW side of Vegas. While there is a 30 min wait across the street at Babystacks, we are welcomed on a Sunday morning with the option of dining indoors or out!  The coffee is strong, the service is great, and the food comes out pretty quickly and hot!  I love that there are not so classis breakfast options with peppers and chilies. A huge variety of omelets, and of course some basic eggs and bacon as well.  On my most recent visit, I went with the special on the board which was a fried French toast with berries. Literally, the BEST French toast I ever had! I devoured all 4 thick sliced and was STUFFED!  My daughter got one of the specialty French toasts on the menus, and hers came with 6 slices. Not sure what the difference was, maybe because mine was the special. Either way I am not complaining at all, both were excellent!  I feel like the staff has all been here for a while, and they got it down well! I also love that some of the dishes are names based on the surrounding neighborhoods. (North shore/South shore etc)  The décor, reminds me of someone's grandmothers kitchen. I love the sign that says, \"We have no Wifi, pretend it's 1995 and talk to each other\".  Delicious, home-style cooking in a neighborhood setting, perfect for everyone!"}
{"text":"Place was ok, I ordered North Shore Scramble and my boyfriend ordered South Shore Scramble. Just standard food, nothing surprising.   Our waitress was very nice and offered my boyfriend a sub. when he asked for no avocado, that never happens.   I personally do not like fruit in my coffee cake and wish the waitress told me there is Apple in it before I ordered it.   If you're looking for a good breakfast joint, go to Egg Works/Egg & I"}
{"text":"This place is always great!!! Delicious food! And great service! I would definitely give it a try! We go there after a night a drinking whenever we visit Vegas lol!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have eaten here several times, and for some reason the service is almost always spotty. Food is great but the servers seem to be always be in a panic. Today we had a server named Vaneza and she was so sweet from start to finish. She deserves to be recognized! Thank you for the wonderful service vaneza!"}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood the other day and decided to stop in for lunch.  Haven't been to this location in awhile and was shocked.  The quality of the food, along with the portion size, has gone downhill.  Also, the food was marginally warm.  Food should be served hot!  On the plus side, the service was good."}
{"text":"I've been here about 10 times. Each time, the food is great. They are totally consistent & constantly busy. That's always a great sign. They have a different coffee cake every time & it's always great. My favorite so far has been the peach one."}
{"text":"First time here and I must say, this place is good! Everything was made well and their cracked croissant was delicious! I will definitely visit this place again when I'm in Vegas again! It's similar to the broken yolk in Cali."}
{"text":"Where to start... this brunch place is my absolute favorite in Vegas! We love in CA and every time we are here we stop for brunch. The potatoes are so delicious and all their egg creations are great. The stuffed french toast is heaven, I get hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Solid food for breakfast or lunch. My colleague ordered the tuna melt with seasoned fries. I ordered the tropical French toast. :O... Sorry mouth was watering thinking about how good it was...  The servers and greeters were very friendly and though the place was busy during the lunch hour we were seated quickly. I took in the sights and found French toast on the menu so my mind was set, just had to figure out which version I wanted to try.  The Tropical French toast comes with toasted coconut, macadamia nuts and topped with sliced bananas. I think there was some powder sugar in there too but the food seem to disappear rather quickly! The seasoned fries my colleague enjoyed came with ranch to dip them in and also had he same problem... poof they were gone!  Will definitely come back and try over menu options. Some funny signs on the wall when paying your bill at the front counter. Enjoy the pics :)"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  I've been to all of the locations.   When I go to Vegas it's my first stop.  Clean and bright on the inside.  Service is quick.  Food is fresh and tastes great.  The best coffee cake and potatoes anywhere!"}
{"text":"It's sorta like Denny's but the menu was more creative... and they had real orange juice. I wouldn't mind going back again but it will be a while before that happens."}
{"text":"This place was great! Fast friendly and efficient. Food was yummy as I had the French toast with over easy eggs and seasoned cut potatoes, all of which were delicious. My husband had an omelette with potatoes and toast which he said was also very good. We also had the coffee and it was some darn good coffee I have to say. Our server was amazing and our total meal only cost $25 ($30 with tip). Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! North Shore Scramble!"}
{"text":"Since breakfast is my most favorite meal of the day, I've tried my fair share of b'fast joints in Vegas; hands down, the best & most consistent b'fast place. The atmosphere is rather simple & quaint, I've liked some things more than others but never had a single complaint about any of the food (the biscuits & gravy initially got me in the door but my latest obsession is the Veggie Benny) & their coffee cake is pure delicious'ness (though I do sometimes wish they'd keep it ol' skool with the raspberry one they had all the time a couple years ago). The only downside is the wait but there's a wait because it's a quality restaurant (so I make sure to plan accordingly)."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Wife and daughter had to try the coffee cake. Omelet was awesome. All in all it was a nice experience. I wpuld definitely recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"The food was amazing as usual. I always get the north shore scramble and sub spinach for the grilled onions. My husband loves the coffee cake it is so delicious. The food was cooked fresh and the wait was reasonable for the amount of people there. I definitely recommend cracked egg to everyone. They are always so friendly and the food is always good."}
{"text":"I ordered a custom veggie scramble and it was great. I requested fruit instead of potatoes and they provided colorful, fresh fruit. Pleasant service too!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!! If you're in Vegas and don't want to eat buffet style food, please do come here!!! Amazing breakfast"}
{"text":"Bland service. Bland food. Over priced breakfast. I was willing to look past all of that as I frequented this place three to four times a week since I live too close for it not to be practical. When I was turned away because u wanted to bring my 5lb dog into the patio on a Sunday morning and get service only to be rudely turned away, that was the last straw. I will never be a patron of this place again! Rachaels kitchen is down the street and they are dog friendly!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in las vegas! It is really busy but thats because it is so good. They are always fast and friendly. The best food ever!! I am addicted to this place. You won't regret going here for breakfast. It is worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Great customer service, Carlos was our waiter he was always on top of it, great food! If your in Vegas you must stop here!"}
{"text":"What you would expect from a country breakfast place l. Big portions and good quality. Usually long wait on the weekends but I guess that's not their fault people want to go there. If you're looking for a good breakfast in a chill environment this is your place but definitely not anything super special"}
{"text":"First timer here. Went inside to check in. Hostess informed us the wait is 10 minutes . We waited bc we want to try their menu,seems the foods here are good  since all tables were filled up. There were 2 chairs available for the people to sit on while waiting to be called ...we were standing by the door and close to the cashier's side. There's not enough room for you to wait inside esp this cold weather.  We got to sit after 15 mins...got out order after 10 minutes I think. Soup was okay just bland( I know there's salt and pepper available) the food that we ordered was good and delish The place is neat also. Their waitress is not bad. But the only thing that we didn't like was the service. The food came out but no one came back for the second time to check if our order is good/okay and or refill  my coffee and water...poor service at all..she only brings  the coffee and water when we asked."}
{"text":"You're normal breakfast fare, with free potatoes and break, i picked coffee bread. Warm, sweet and goes really well with coffee."}
{"text":"First time there .great service yummy food I had the south shore scramble. Very good . Will be back for sure. Great coffee"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but it was just very forgetable and overpriced.  It was a cute place and the servers were fine.   Basic issue is that the food wasn't special and it was overpriced. With tax and tip I walked out of here paying $10 for a bowl of oatmeal. It wasn't steel cut oats, just regular Quaker Oats you add water to and it was served with brown sugar, milk, cheap cereal stale granola and a cup of berries, mostly blackberries. It was a healthy portion of oatmeal, but it should have cost closer to $5. I did try the coffee cake, which was good but not out of this world.    I would rather go to the Egg and I or Bread and Butter for the same price. You get a lot tastier food."}
{"text":"We came here by default because the ever so popular babystacks was over an 1 hour and 20 minute wait.   The wait wasn't too long here, we waited a good 15 minutes on Sunday - Mother's Day to be exact.   We ordered:  The Cracked Croissant - $10.75 we love buttery croissant breakfast sandwiches, so this was a definite for us. We chose sunny side up eggs and the runny yolk was rich and delicious with the sandwich. We also chose the sausage patty and a side of soggy hash browns - I'm thinking of asking them to make them well done and crispier next time. Overall I really enjoyed this dish. It was simple, but everything combined made for a great (expensive) breakfast sandwich. 4/5   Cakes & Eggs Combo - $8.50 I chose sunny side up eggs (comes with 2), bacon (comes with 2), and substituted the regular pancakes (comes with 2) with the Coconut macadamia pancakes (comes with 2) - bad decision.  The sunny side eggs were fried to perfection - both eggs had an extremely luscious and runny yolk. The eggs were very sweet and fresh. I wish the bacon was crispy, it was rather soggy. 3/5   Now onto the pancakes, they had an extra cost to substitute them ($1.50 or so) for the coconut macadamia pancakes. So not worth it! Although the pancakes were fluffy, they were also very dry. The pancakes had the faintest coconut flavor (actually, I barely tasted it) the \"coconut flavor\" was more like a prank. It did have dry coconut flakes, which was not texturally pleasing and only 7 small pieces of macadamia nuts throughout the entire pancake! It sounded better on paper than what was actually brought to the table. I wasn't satisfied or happy with these pancakes - they were a lie. 1/5  It was pricey for what we ended up getting. My favorites were their sunny side up eggs and the sausage. You can get that anywhere!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and spectacular service.  Very friendly staff.  The menu had a lot of variety."}
{"text":"Fun breakfast joint. Good food, main attraction are the friendly chatty wait staff. Feels like a cheerier, nicer looking Mel's diner. Recommend the omelettes with side of pancakes."}
{"text":"I got the country benny and coffee cake. The benny was ok, the eggs were still wet from poaching which made the mushy. The country gravy was bland and nothing special. The coffee cake was served hot but other than that it tasted like plain white cake with strudel on top. The waitress was very pleasant and service was quick."}
{"text":"This place is very cozy and has friendly service. The wait time hasn't been that bad the times I've been here. I usually get the eggs Benedict. Their hollandaise sauce is very good. The corned beef hash is my boyfriends usual choice and he loves it. It's become one of our regular breakfast places."}
{"text":"This was the busiest I've seen this place. Usually I go and we get seated right away. It was about a 15 minute wait which isn't bad. They have decent food and decent prices. Really wish they had more combos though, I like my breakfast to come with a little assortment. Here I always spend more because breakfast potatoes don't come with the pancakes and egg combo.. sometimes I get a side of coffee cake too because that doesn't come with the combo either."}
{"text":"We've eaten numerous times here and I can say the food and service is great. But TODAY the service just to be seated SUCKED... We asked for a booth for a party if 5, 2- booths were empty, guests that arrived after us got seated??? First of all don't say we wouldn't have fit in a booth since majority ALL the booths are the same size and 2nd don't LIE to my face and say the party that you just sat came before me!!! It will be awhile until I'm stepping into this restaurant."}
{"text":"Decent food, friendly service. If you're in the mood for breakfast this place hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Second time here.  First time was ok, so I decided to try it again.   Service is great among the older adults. . A few young kids at the front, don't acknowledge you  until you are right in front of them for several minutes...  There always appears to be a long wait, but it's not. They move tables quickly, and you will be seated within the time they say.   Our server, who ironically I had the first time was fantastic!   The menu offers a large variety of breakfast items - skillets, omelets, and  eggs anyway you like... Along with it you get hash browns or skillet potatoes, toast or coffee cake..   OMG - the coffee cake, some of the best you will every put in your mouth.. Fresh, moist and served warm...    If you are looking for an exceptional place for Breakfast this is not the place, but  it is good food, with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place where we could sit and enjoy a nice breakfast with my future father-in-law and fiancée. After a slow service start at the door, we were seated after 30 minutes.  The food was excellent, the coffee was amazing. Fiancée and I got the Green Kale Omelet special and Dad got the Build Your Own Skillet - all were happy."}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Big, bad wolf\" omelet and it was okay. There was too much cheese on the omelet, that's for sure. And the other half of the plate were some mediocre has browns. There was really nothing special about it, which I thought it would be. I really feel like I ordered the wrong omelet and I am willing to give this place a try again.  On the other hand though, my grandparents ordered \"the club\" sandwich (they both only ate half of the half) so when I got home I tried the sandwich and it was about of this world!!! I mean it was super delicious. 3 pieces of bread, loads of avocado. It was just delicious. I would never have thought a sandwich would be better than an omelet at a place called \"the cracked egg\"!   I should also note that, this place was busy, and VERY loud, so this is not a great pick if you need to chat with whom ever you are with!"}
{"text":"This location is so much busier than all the other ones in town! The Cracked Egg is by far my favorite breakfast chain in Vegas. Now.. I love potatoes. If we go out to eat, I will have all my sides potato related. Hash browns are my favorite potato form.. When you come here GET THE SEASONED POTATOES as the side. Trust me. Don't ask. Just do it. It's so mouth watering.  Their country fried steak hits the right spot every time. The steak isn't huge, but isn't small. It's the perfect size. Now again.. Make sure you get their COFFEE CAKE. Yes. Do it. You can thank me later! Their corned beef hash is perfect but does get cold a little faster than I'd like. The big bad wolfe is their best omelette too. It's off a small menu so you wouldn't find it on the original one!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat breakfast hands down! There's nothing I love more in the world then a good brunch ya hear? I always order the Veggy Benny, my husband switches things up. The Veggy Benny, in my opinion, is basically made of magic. It's spot on and I have nothing but rave reviews. My husband loves their south shore scramble. He recently tried their monte crisco, basically a ham and cheese sandwich dipped in french toast batter and deep fried, he said it was meh and should be served at a carnival so I wouldn't recommend that dish unless you're a carni, I feel like carni's don't read reviews though. The potatoes that come with your breakfast have a great spice to them. I've had the same ones at various other breakfast hubs but they're my fav so I'm happy. Now on to the famous coffee cake. First off all you yelp readers should know that I absolutely hate cake in general. I don't have a sweet tooth and I'm just not down with the fluffy cake consistency. For some reason though the coffee cake here is irresistible! They switch up the flavors every day, chocolate chip is my fav. I've never tried crack (hi mom) but this coffee cake is so crazy good that I believe it may be just as addictive as crack. Defiantly. Maybe."}
{"text":"Chile verde was awesome - really awesome.  Pancakes and eggs were both reliable. Potatoes were yummy. No cappucino, only coffee, but good coffee.  We had to wait for some time on a Sunday morning, but I would wait again."}
{"text":"Ok, its been 3 years since the last visit.  Had breakfast arriving at 6:20 am.  Again hope management or the owner reads this post.  -No one to greet us, waited 5 minutes or so, sat ourselves. -Noticed only one very busy super nice guy named Juan working his butt off. -Within 20 minutes, Juan (by himself, no one else in the dinning room) was handling 14 tables  and over 35 diners by himself.  -More people coming in and no one to set them.  Juan running around trying to accomplish everything....greeting some of the people, running water and coffee, serving, busing, etc.  to now almost 20 tables with over 50 diners...(yes I am counting, my wife told me to stop).  But I was amazed by watching Juan do all these task.    I hope Juan gets paid as a greeter host, server, food runner, bus person, and cashier because he certainly was doing all of these jobs almost seamlessly.   Food prices have increased quite a bit.  Had the Chicken, gravy, eggs, hash browns, toast.  -Eggs were good. -Their gravy is not bad, I would say good...but not as good as Mr Mama's! -Chicken was not good, mostly hard breaded batter.  I remember the chicken as being much better. -HASH BROWNS...well awesome, probably the best that I have had here in town!  This place has so much potential and I really want to like it.  Saves me over 12 miles round trip from going to Mr Mamas (Rated #1 on yelp I believe) on Jones and Russell.  Oh, by 7am a young lady showed up to help Juan, whew!    **********   FIVE STARS TO JUAN!   ***********"}
{"text":"We are eating at the cracked egg the place is awesome friendly people awesome food  great place to take the family prices are great all around the best place to be in vegas  on 9921  west Charlestown blvd"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great for kids. Great menu,price is ok. Love the South shore, get it ever time."}
{"text":"This place should change it's name to F*CKING AMAZING BURGER TOWN.  In fact you herd it here and now you cracked bastard a name change is in effect.  I've been to this place a number of times and have always ordered the same thing, which is the Blue Cheese Bacon Burger.  It is by far the best burger I have had in Las Vegas to date.  OK people before you get carried away I am not saying it is the best burger in sin city I am simply saying it is the best burger I have HAD in Vegas.   My wife and I had made our first visit to this fine establishment about a year ago, let me start off by saying I am not a breakfast person. Now I know what your thinking, but hold the slings and arrows for just minute and let me explain myself.  It is not that I am apposed of eating a scrumptious meal in the morning, in fact I am quite fond of it, however for every waffley, syrupesc, eggtastic creation in existence I always seem to find something much more appealing on any lunch or dinner menu.  Now my wife on the other hand being the complete opposite as one of those breakfast for dinner kind of folks, this is the perfect place for us.  So now with that being said if you are looking for a great place that serves both breakfast and lunch with no time restrictions this is the place for you.  My wife has tried everything from the biscuits and gravy to the eggs benedict, to a southwest scramble I was particularly fond and everything has been extremely above par. Also I will say again they do make one tasty burger which , of course, is served with french fries that are also out of this world.  So yeah I'll end by saying,\"Go to The Cracked Egg\".  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We left our car at the dealer and walked over. We were seated fast at 9am breakfast rush. The food was great and Lisa was a fantastic waitress! She came around often and we were completely satisfied and didn't wait or wanted anything else. The coffee cake was awesome! All around I totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Their potatoes alone are a 5/5. It's so delicious! I had the chicken fried steak and it's amazing! Great portioning sizes too! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This place has the best breakfast. When I get breakfast, I don't want Denny's, not Ihop, but the Cracked Egg. The country fried steak and wolf omelette is so good. DO NOT GET THE HASH BROWNS. The potatoes are where it's at. Even though there's multiple locations, it doesn't feel like a corporate owned place. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting too much coming here, just a simple place to have some brunch before going shopping. The food was ok, nothing fantastic or terrible, just ok. I wasn't really pleased with having cold toast, though. But what really got me was our server. After we had finished our food and before our plates were cleared, our server brought a nearby table their food, then got in a conversation with another table and his back was to us. He talked so long that the first table FINISHED their meal and he was still talking, ignoring everyone else. All we wanted was our check. Finally a third table asked if he could please check on their food and he was not pleased at being interrupted. He informed her that he has other tables, not just her, and stormed off to the kitchen. Rude. And to top it all off, 30 minutes after leaving both my husband and myself (we ordered different foods and different drinks) were extremely ill. Gut wrenching horribleness. I doubt I'll go again, I'll find another diner."}
{"text":"Great bday breakfast. Mo ordered the Cowboy skillet. I ordered an omelet with hash browns. She picked the order up. Her skillet was missing all of the onions and peppers. Her potatoes were rock hard. She couldn't eat them. My omelet was a seared to death scrambled egg mixture. I had fluffy omelets in the past from here. Oh and my hash browns were slices of dried potatoes with black spots. Thanks Cracked Egg! Not!"}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg is a fantastic place to go to for breakfast or brunch. I have been in here several times with a few different people and I always order pancakes whenever I'm here. Usually it's busy every time when we come here, but it's always worth it!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in town (coming from a person who could eat breakfast food 24/7, 365 days a year). One thing to add. Always get their seasoned potatoes on the side. Always. They won't tell you what's in their seasoning because it's a secret. Believe me, I tried. Was told the coffee cake can bring you closer to God. Good prices for fantastic food. Clean and comfortable. Cute decorations. Friendly staff. Would give 10/10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"What I ate: Veggie Benny, coffee cake, bite of chocolate chip pancake Visit date: September 25, 2011 First time? Indeed.  Hurray! Finally! Some good food on my Vegas trip. I had the Veggy Benny - the Veggie Eggs Benedict, that is. Um, delicious! A fluffy biscuit, grilled tomato, spinach and poached egg, served with Cajun style potatoes. Their hollandaise is amazing. I started dipping the potatoes in it.  My bro-in-law's coffee cake came as an \"appetizer\". I had a piece. I was so cakey, moist and warm. And it had some kind of fruit it in...cherries? Who knows. It was fabulous. I also tried my niece's chocolate chip pancakes. Yum. She was also a happy camper.  All the kids (niece and nephews) enjoyed their bacon. And syrup. And the bacon in the syrup."}
{"text":"Monte Cristo sandwich is my favorite thing ever, I even call and order it to pick up sometimes!! When I do dine in its always a great experience, great attentive servers."}
{"text":"Sometimes busy but worth the wait! Love the food I get here every time. The staff is friendly and service is great even when it's packed!"}
{"text":"Food looked exceptionally good but two of us rated the taste/preparation as three star. I primarily went for the gluten-free but since they cross contaminate the grill, deep fryer and toaster - that makes no sense to me. Although seemed busy, this GF sensitive person will not be back."}
{"text":"Perfect morning spot for yummy food! Ask for Erin, she's the best, she will remember you every time with all your special requests! She's a true GEM!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been regulars here at least twice a week. The service and food, we have never had to complain.It also helps with their coupon. Today, after a great lunch, I tried to pay with their coupon and was told it is NOT accepted today due to the holiday. I asked what holiday and I was told Nevada Day. Yes, the coupon said no good on holidays, but I thought this was not a federal holiday, but a state holiday. I asked to speak with the manager, Juliana Yunis. With an attitude, she confirmed the above. No apology, just turned her back and walked away.  Do I dare walk in on All Saints Day?  As I said, the service and food is great, the manager needs to take a management course and at least smile. Left bad taste and will not return."}
{"text":"Came to Phoenix for business and stopped here for some foos. I ordered the 2 eggs with waffle and hash brown and it was very good. We came in before closing and they were very nice and gave a fast service. Will definitely come here again on our next trip."}
{"text":"I should have reviewed the Cracked Egg a long time ago. It's one of my favorite places for breakfast or when I want breakfast for lunch. The food and service have always been great. If you haven't been get the coffee cake, the type changes every day it's always good; and the seasoned potatoes are also a great option.  The omelettes and waffles are really good too.  Had a really minor issue on our last visit and they went WAY out of their way to fix it. It's great to see a restaurant that cares so much about taking great care of their customers."}
{"text":"Probably eat here at least 3x a week whether it's with friends or family. Can always count on great food and great service that's what brings me back."}
{"text":"this place is a quaint little place that we met friends at.  Went based on their recommendations a lot but this place is very efficient. the staff was great and helpful, always responding to us quickly.   the food was good and came out exactly how we wanted it.  there are many options on the menu for all taste buds.  I got the fruit side with my eggs and it was a nice change with grapefruit, watermelon and honeydew rather than your typical fruit mix.  It was all nice and fresh too. Per their recommendation we shared a piece of the crumb cake.  Wasn't your typical crumb cake, more like a light fluffy piece of cake with some cream cheese bottom and icing on top but it was well balanced and the cheese wasn't overwhelming. My understanding is the flavors change too, will have to see.  They do have a frequent rewards/point card that they tell me gives you good coupons.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Rock solid and consistently good.  While not my favorite breakfast place in town, it's probably the one I go to the most because it's the perfect blend of convenience, tasty food and an always friendly staff.  Location.  Parking right at the restaurant can be difficult.  If you dont strike gold and find a spot in front of the restaurant, just park in the large lot that spans the front of the shopping center facing Charleston Blvd.  Getting into the parking lot is easy, but getting out can be tricky depending on where you're trying to go.  The Charleston - Hualapai intersection can be a challenge.  The Food.  As mentioned, the food is consistently good.  Over time I've tried all but one of the omelettes (the Carnitas is my favorite), three of the \"scrambles\" (try the Southshore Scramble for something mild, or the Southwest Scramble for a little zing), and three of the Eggs Benedict (the traditional Eggs Benedict is my favorite, with a side of bacon).  They also have amazing salads for a breakfast place.  I've never ventured into the pancakes, french toast or other similar breakfast items because I love eggs for breakfast enough that I never seem to stray away from them.  My wife and friends routinely get these other items though and have never been unhappy.  If you have a gluten sensitivity, there's a significant menu for you as well, so dive in!  The Staff.  In the end, the Cracked Egg is a large chain, and there are a number of similar breakfast chains out there.  I've been to a few.  (I might like breakfast.)  Big chain restaurants are..well, big chains and honestly it's hard for me to give them a rating higher than a three.  In fact, I usually don't review them unless they stand out for some reason.  In this case, the staff at this Cracked Egg location is what makes this a four star review.  So go, enjoy the food, and let the staff take care of you."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town if your in vegas loved the food it was extremely delicious. I highly recommend this place as a good spot to eat if you want bomb food will be coming back"}

{"text":"Once again my favorite breakfast spot does not dissapointment service is good food is excellent and cooked perfectly to order. Hands down my fav spot for breakfast in las vegas. The coffee cake is always fresh and a great substitute for the traditional white or wheat toast. I think I have said enough. I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"Love coming here the omelettes are so yummy!! I always get fruit on the side.. It's nice they have gealthy options on their menu"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few years. And it doesn't matter what I order is always good. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Service deserves a 5 star! Our server was an older woman and was on top of it! Coffee was refilled, check-ins were timed appropriately and knowledgable with the menu and gave us options with salsas.  The portions were perfect for the prices that we paid, and the taste was actually pretty good! I have to say that I preferred their potatoes over Matt's big breakfast because they were toasted evenly throughout (not burnt on one side) - they could have been seasoned more but regardless, they were good. The eggs were cooked perfectly and they tasted like real eggs, the hashbrowns were plentiful and again a decent sized portion. I had the Belgian waffle and my husband had the pancakes both were good - we've had better but they were decent. For it being a last minute decision we were very happy with this restaurant for breakfast. It definitely felt like the neighborhood restaurant - homely feel. :)"}
{"text":"I love the Cracked Egg! We stopped by on our way out of town, and I'm so glad we did!   The coffee is always good, the coffee CAKE is always good... and service is always good! It's the best little breakfast joint a girl could hope for!  Last time I went, I got the egg white omelet, which is something I've never had before. I expected it to taste... healthy. However, I was very surprised at the amazing flavor, because it had peppers and salsa to go with it. It was delicious! And less guilt! (Don't worry - I made up for it with the coffee cake scarfage).  Our whole group loved all the dishes we got, and left with a full belly and smiles on our faces... Now to stay out of our food comas for the car ride back to LA..."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! I'd like to give this place five stars, but I can't. The girls at the front are rude. Instead of worrying about the customers and being prompt - they chit chat with one another and act like you're not standing there. We saw our server one time. She took our order and that was it. Had to ask the hostess to get my bill for me. She seemed annoyed, but did it. When I went to pay I handed the cashier my money and she just sat there chatting with her co-worker. I ended up walking out without my change, receipt, or a thank you."}
{"text":"First time here and I will return next time in Vegas.  Really good place for breakfast.   Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Portions are good, been there many times, never an issue."}
{"text":"We drove all the way out here to try Babycakes not knowing they'd have an excruciatingly long line, so we turned to Yelp to find something nearby that would satisfy our breakfast needs.  Up popped Cracked Egg.  We were already in the area anyways, and reading all the great reviews, we decided to head on down.    Much shorter wait ... about 5 minutes.  Still nice and busy.  Kind of a random strip mall to be located in - almost industrial looking ... but then again, considering it seemed most of the restaurants outside the strip seemed to be in this kind of environment, I think that's just how Vegas rolls?   Ambiance inside was nice, however, and the servers were super sweet and helpful.  The three of us girls were starving so after a thorough gander through the menu, my friend ordered the Veggie Benny (Vegetarian Benedict since she hates Canadian bacon), I ordered the Country Benny (because my fat arse really wanted some gravy), and my other friend ordered the Croissant French Toast.  Got to choose from either hash browns or seasoned potatoes.  My friend asked the server if they made their own hash browns or if they came from the frozen industrial stuff.  Unfortunately it came from the frozen variety, so we opted for the seasoned potatoes.  Luckily, the seasoned potatoes are delicious - so no sacrifice there!  We also ordered ourselves some orange juice and coffee.  Came with your typical diner - accompaniments (half & half creamers and sugar).  Considering all the crap that's in that weird half & half, we decided to ask her for some milk, instead, and luckily, she was super cool about it :)    My country benny was very good...super fulfilling, too.  Wish the gravy were just a tad more flavorful - it was a bit bland for country-style gravy, but hey..I'm a gravy sucka and as long as it was smothered on my biscuit and sausage, I was still a happy girl.  All in all, I'm not sure if I'd go out of my way to eat here again, but would definitely not be against it if we happened to find ourselves out round these parts."}
{"text":"Went to breakfast this morning and got some eggs Benedict.... Literally the best eggs Benedict I've ever eaten. Food was amazing and the staff was really friendly, considering how busy it was. I've honestly been going here for years and never wrote a review, so I decided why not throw them five stars. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for good breakfast food. We always have to wait a bit but it is definitely worth it. Like everyone else has said, TRY THE COFFEE CAKE! Everyone that has tried it with me raves and we fight over who gets the last bite. Service is great and everyone is very friendly. I'm glad this is near my house. It rivals Egg Works for sure."}
{"text":"Came in and was told 20 minutes for seating. Sat down for around 30 minutes, noticed that the seating hostess never even added our names to the list by calling names far after us. Unproffessional. Next time I would rather waste my 20 minutes at a better business. When I was finally seated, she didnt even know my name to be seated. Say goodbye to a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"Lots of food for your money.  Great friendly service.  OJ was expensive but that maybe an AZ thing."}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast you can have in the valley. There is nothing fancy or pretentious. Just farm fresh ingredients prepared excellently. Kathie our server is the best. ."}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg has been my go-to breakfast place for the past decade. I religiously order the PESTO SCRAMBLE and always choose the seasoned potatoes. My boyfriend has tried a vast majority of their breakfast items and is never dissatisfied. Their service is on point and I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a seat. Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"I loved every morsel of my food!! I was super greedy and not afraid to tell everyone reading this review! If you're on a diet.... order water!! Thank you for the great food and customer service!!"}
{"text":"Service was top notch!  Very attentive staff.  My husband enjoyed the corned beef hash.  My eggs Benedict was ok.  The facility is pretty old, run down and bathrooms were scary."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend come here at about 12:50 , and we waited for our food forever . we seen 2 tables sit 30 minutes after us and they got their food 10 minutes of them being seated . we didnt get our food for probably 45 minutes . they either need more cooks or a faster team ."}
{"text":"I love the food here because it is always made to  order perfectly and is delicious. Unfortunately, no matter what time of the morning or early afternoon, weekday or weekend, I have eaten here, the food takes forever to arrive.  It is always packed! Do not go here if you are in a hurry.  If service and delivery time were faster, I would give it 5 stars.  With all the business they have, and on weekends the long wait time for a table, you would think that they are raking in the money and could afford more waitresses and more cooks. But I will still keep on coming because I do enjoy their food"}
{"text":"I know this is going to sound crazy because this is a breakfast place but do your self a favor and ask what soup they have for the day and if it's the baked potato soup GET IT !!! I ordered the Mexican scramble (I think that's what it was Called ) it was good had Jalapnoes and chorizo and cheese tons of flavor and went great with the potatoes . My next tip is you get a choice of toast or the daily coffee cake which comes out warm and is a huge square that you could share if you felt so inclined ( I destroyed the whole thing ) this place was busy but they handle it well our food came out fast and it was all delicious . If your in the area stop in !"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday morning because it's one of the only breakfast spots in henderson and waited 45 minutes for a table because the manager kept setting tables before us. We had 5 children all of whom were crying because they were so hungry and she did nothing but give me attitude when I asked how much longer after 30 minutes. Food is mediocre at best and NOT worth the 45 minute wait"}
{"text":"I have only eaten here once and it was delicious! My daughter had the mini chicks I think it was called and I built my own burrito. The food was so good and cooked just right. All the drinks we ordered tasted a bit off and they were just normal drinks so I am not sure if it was just their machine. The wait on a Sunday morning wasn't too bad, about 25 minutes. Our server was attentive but not intrusive and all the other staff were friendly as well. The only negative spot was two of the staff were vocal about some disagreement they were having with another staff member. It made it a bit a bit awkward."}
{"text":"We came during a busy Sunday breakfast and even though the place was packed, the service was still great. My coffee cup was never empty and the biscuits and gravy I ordered were some of the best I've had. It was my first time dining there and I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but things don't arrive as ordered always. The servers are friendly and generally, it's an average diner. It's slightly over priced."}
{"text":"Delicious food and fast service!  My boyfriend and I ordered chicken fried steak with a coffee cake, and a Californian omelette.  The coffee cake came out first and it was piping hot! It was a lemon cake and it was absolutely amazing. It tasted homemade and felt very nostalgic. The chicken fried steak was your standard affair. Delicious sausage gravy and yummy well seasoned potatoes. The Californian omelette had slices of bacon folded into the omelet, topped with a couple slices of cheese and a half of an avocado.   It was very busy but the staff worked fast and efficiently that everything was still piping hot. It was our first time here and it's only up the street from our house. I don't know why we haven't gone her sooner."}
{"text":"Great place!!  We just moved the area and we will make this a \"go to\" breakfast stop for sure! Big place, diner setting. Family owned. HUGE HUGE HUGE breakfast skillets, omelets and many kinds of pancakes and waffles from which to choose!. Our waitress was the best!"}
{"text":"Wide selection of breakfast/brunch items- anything your heart desires from your standard scramble, to omelet, or even breakfast skillet. Everything is pretty standard though, nothing to make this place unique. I would say that the quality is better than IHOP or Denny's but sometimes the wait isn't worth it.  This specific location is a little on the small side, so we had to wait about 30 mins to be seated on a Saturday morning.  Coffee cake is good :) Very moist with blueberries. And it's included with your meal. Yum."}
{"text":"Had Breakfast  here this morning! Fantastic.... try the Big Bad Wolf ! Great service ... good food !! Las Vegas this is good food!"}
{"text":"Gluten free menu is excellent -- a lot of choices and awesome pancakes -- forgot to add the service is great the people who work there are always quick and very warm. Recommend this place to all my gluten free friends"}
{"text":"I eat here about two times a week. I LOVE LIZ she is the best server in the place. breakfast, lunch, oatmeal, eggs, burgers youj name it it is all really good. I have been going here for about two years.....YUMMMMMMY"}
{"text":"In terms of the decor and atmosphere, it's decent. Food wise, I only remember trying their savory plates! So far, it's been quite delicious! :) I recently tried the Chili Rellenos Omelette, the omelette had a lot of flavor to it and you just can't go wrong with seasoned potatoes at any breakfast place! Right? Their menus are unique looking (like a newspaper)! It can be pretty loud and crowded. I wouldn't say this is one of my top favorite breakfast place, but it's an overall good breakfast place!   P.S. Wait for food can be kind of long sometimes"}
{"text":"This place is great. The options are incredible and they even have Gluten Free options! The wait can be a bit long so definitely choose your timing wisely or plan to add your name and shop at one of the nearby stores."}
{"text":"I just love this place! din in or dine out! the food is good fun and if your good you can find out about their secret hidden menu! (cordon blue bowl anyone!)"}
{"text":"The service and the food here are phenomenal!! I've been here 2 days in a row. Both days, Liz has been our server. She is super friendly and really shows that she loves her job. She is a true credit to the restaurant and the industry itself.   In regards to the food, I think my buddy gave the best review I've ever heard. After taking the first bite of warm homemade apple coffee cake, he looks up and with a giant grin says, \"This bite made me smile. I feel warm inside!\"   The food here is the epitome of comfort food. My first day, I ordered the Carnitas omelette with a slice of their homemade chocolate chip coffee cake (they have a different flavor of coffee cake every day). The carnitas were so tender and the eggs were cooked to perfection! I held the peppers and onions, but added avocado.   Today I ordered the bacon cheeseburger skillet with hash browns instead of the country potatoes and a slice of homemade apple coffee cake (told ya they change the flavor every day;). It was amazing! In addition, every time I see skillets, there's usually a pool of oil at the end of meal. Not here my friends! Just pure deliciousness! This is a must stop spot for the Vegas vacation!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this place yet. I've probably been here more times than I can remember.  The layout of the restaurant is a bit weird. I like sitting in the section off to the side rather than where the door is. The front section is a bit cavernous and feels \"warehousey\" I am aware this is not a word, but it seems like the best description. Despite that, I am willing to tolerate it cause the food is good.  I think my favorite dish here is the Chicken Fried Steak. Smothered in country gravy and served with your choice of  eggs, potatoes and toast. The steak is nicely breaded, superbly crispy and mouthwateringly yummy. I like to step it up a notch and sub the toast for biscuits with even more gravy. And of course I like scrambled eggs (when I like eggs) and the seasoned potatoes. My second \"usual\" is the Monte Cristo.   You know the saying, \"stick to what you're used to.\" I should have heeded that one morning. I tried their raspberry french toast. Eww. Not happy. Not sweet. So unappetizing to me that I barely made it through one slice. Their presentation is a bit lacking but really what can I say. As far as local breakfast places go, I'm usually not in it for the presentation. Heck, most of the time I'm not even awake enough to appreciate it.  The portions are pretty generous and the service is quick and friendly. My bf likes it, I like it. The hot chocolate is good. All in all, a win win place for me."}
{"text":"I just moved to town and this is already my go to for a great meal. They only serve breakfast and lunch and wow do they :) it's sooo god I can't wait to try the monte cristo next time! This time I had north coast scrambler -- yummm A+"}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for about two years probably about 2-4x's a month. Same location. It's always been pretty good breakfast and service but the last handful of visits the service has gotten worse. This last visit I walked in the front doors and wait behind a couple of people in line to put my name in for a table and some older whites guys walks up and bypasses the line to get a name if first. The only response I get from the hostess is \"were you waiting to put a name in for a table?\" In pretty sure I had a WTF look on my face.   I only mention \"older white guy\" because I do see this white privilege entitlement around town. Mostly by \"older white guys\" and other middle aged white guys I would assume is the off spring of the older ones. Many times I confront them about cutting in line for things and they just throw their hands up like \"I don't know.\"   So in short, my family will frequent cracked eggs a lot less."}
{"text":"I've dined here quite a few times, so it's safe to say this place is A-ok in my book. It's your typical sit down breakfast/lunch place with omelets, pancakes, skillets, sandwiches and burgers. The portions are fairly large and the prices are decent. We always have left overs no matter what we order.   I've tried breakfast and lunch items, but honestly nothing really stands out as \"wow I need to order this again.\" The only thing worth mentioning is their COFFEE CAKE! It's served warm and it's so so soft. The flavor changes daily but my favorite has got to be the strawberry or the pumpkin. Even if I order a burger, I will still order me a side of coffee cake, it's that good.   The service is hit or miss. I've had servers who looked happy to be there. However, I've also had servers who hated their lives and it showed. On our last visit, our server seemed to be rushing through the motions. No biggie though. The one thing I'm definitely not a fan of is the waiting area. It can get congested really fast. With customers having to go to the register to pay, that just adds to even more congestion.  I'm not in any rush to eat here again. But I wouldn't be opposed for someone suggested this for breakfast."}
{"text":"Went for a breakfast meeting and pretty typical breakfast place. The server was very nice but very aware we were there for a business meeting so was very good about finding spots to come check on us and refill our coffees. I got the The manager ( she was dressed in casual attire and had keys ) was VERY unpleasant. She seemed very cold when she dropped off our food not saying anything and a little annoyed. Her expression never changed... Usually not a big deal to me but when its early you want smiley faces around you serving your food. Otherwise it just sets the tone for a bad day. It left such a bad impression I probably wont be back... I got the \"Lighten Up\" which was okay but really not worth the $9 for eggs and country potatoes."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast joint. Always packed on the weekends but the menu is big and delicious. The skillets are perfect and if you get a half order its even a better value. Their loyalty program coupons make it super affordable. The wait staff is wonderful just wish they had call ahead wait list cause it gets jam packed in there..but for good reason!"}
{"text":"Yummy coffee cake, ok food that lacks flavor development. HORRIBLY SLOW SERVICE. Oh and their fresh squeezed orange juice....isn't. Servers are aloof.  Won't be back. The Ann Rd location kills this one. The highlight was a really nice, polite and helpful busboy."}
{"text":"The food was okay. The crumb cake they serve hot was amazing but the eggs Benedict was just average."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and will be back. The food and service were great, especially because we went on a holiday and the place was really busy! Our waitress was friendly and tge service was fast. I had the Southwest scramble with the seasoned potatoes,  and my boyfriend had the LA Carnitas. The food came out hot and cooked exactly how we requested it. The portions are good not too much and not small either we both enjoyed our food and thought it tasted great so we will be back. Next time will try the coffee cake that we've heard is delicious!"}
{"text":"Just finished a delightful breakfast.  I would definitely go back but still doesn't beat my favorite place... Blueberry hill pancake house.  Love the new location of this place. Fast and pleasant service. Never had to wait or ask for a refill on our water and coffee. Coffee cake is a great choice. Moist warm and not overly sweet with the right amount of icing.  I've had the monte crisco at the different location which I do love but this time had the egg white scramble. Nice flavor and a good serving size.  Will be back."}
{"text":"This place has great food and really nice servers, BUT it is a struggle to order vegetarian dishes.  We wanted to substitute veggies for meat on an omelet, but were told no because their policy is meat for meat substitute only.  This is the first restaurant that hasn't accommodated vegetarian needs. I would have given a higher rating had it been different. We won't be coming back because we can't eat here."}
{"text":"They will go above and beyond if you're not happy. Ashley the manager was super helpful. They also have a gluten free menu with great options."}
{"text":"Great food and extremely attentive service. They have an extensive variety, including Greek food as one of the owners is Greek. We really enjoyed this place and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab brunch on the weekend.  Brace yourself...there will be a long wait, but it is well worth the wait.    My friend and I ordered two egg dishes, the Greek which had feta, tomatoes and spinach and she ordered the Denver which had spinach, cheese and bacon in it.  Both of them were absolutely amazing!  The Greek was very tasty and super flavorful.  I think the spinach could have been left off, but it was still good.  Both dishes come with your choice of hash browns, toast and coffee cake.  Get the coffee cake.  They have differently flavors every time you attend and its not like normal coffee cake found at Starbucks.  Its super fluffy and light and the flavors are super amazing.  The oreo coffee cake was great!  I would totally come there again the next time I come back to visit."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Both times the service and friendly demeanor was exceptional. The food was great!  Little story: the first time I was at this location I had planned to meet a friend here. I was waiting and waiting. the server brought me a coffee... finally i decided that my friend and I had mixed up our locations so i went to the front to pay for my coffee and the person at the cash register (i'm assuming the owner or at least manager), so \"no problem, honey, coffee is on us\" - I was blown away by their generosity and realized that this is the way all businesses should do business... no where else I can think of would be this kind."}
{"text":"Great mexican skillet. The chorizo was a great combo with the seasoned potatoes, jalapenos and eggs. I got mine over medium so the yolk makes it a little saucy!   Coffee cake was just ok though. Very sweet and not really flavored like anything. Like a white cake with a little jam on one corner of the bottom. Next time I'll get toast or something.  My breakfast companion had the eggs b. He loved it. I tried a taste and thought the ham was much to smoky for me.  We will definitely go back though."}
{"text":"Decided to finally try this place out. It's a cute little place to have breakfast with a great variety of foods to choose from.   I got the Country Benny which is biscuits and gravy with poached egg. It was really good but I couldn't finish it. I would have liked a little bit more gravy to compliment the amount of biscuits there is.  My beau got the Carnitas omelette. It was pretty good. Only complaint is that the vegetables (onions, bell pepper) needed to be cut in smaller pieces.   On beautiful days like today you can actually sit outside to eat."}
{"text":"Love to eat here for breakfast when i get a chance too! Very friendly and excellent customer service. Love their coffee cakes before the meal. 4 stars because it should be bigger!"}
{"text":"Server was great but the tall large blonde hostess or manager? needs to smile and have a personality.  We love going there but her dismissive attitude was not fitting to a normally super friendly place"}
{"text":"Another reviewer (Kish M.) states, \"Remember, there's only so much that you can do with eggs, toast, and bacon\" - and yet, somehow, this place managed to fuck up every variation my family tried. You have to work at it, really hard, to make Eggs Benedict unpalatable. You have to expend concerted effort to make scrambled eggs so dry and unappealing that even my kid, the scourge of all eggs,  won't eat them. I don't even remember what my wife ordered, but she gave up after two bites, because it was revolting."}
{"text":"The breakfast was great! I had the California omelette with seasoned fries. The fries were the best I ever tasted!"}
{"text":"A little disappointed as this place has relatively good reviews. Here is my justification for my rating. I ordered the bowl of fruit and I did not expect it to look like the picture, obviously. When I got it, it had bananas, grapes and strawberries. The bananas were overly mushy and the grapes were a little to wrinkly. Strawberries seemed fine.  My wife ordered biscuits with gravy, 3 eggs and 3 sausages. Now here is where the big disappointment was...the biscuit was hard and tasted a little rancid. The biscuits seemed they might have been a few days old just sitting around. I place my faith that this was not the case, but there was certainly something wrong with the biscuit.  The sausage tasted a little off. Not in a bad way but off.   The eggs, well that is hard to get wrong when cooking it sunny side up.   Overall, if you're going to charge $5.49 for a bowl of fruit, it should be of better quality. Bananas that were probably going to be thrown out that day should not be served like that. It's summer, so throwing in some melons would have been great.    The service was good and are waitress made sure to check up on us here and there which we appreciated, but the quality of the food that was served should not have been that poor. I might give it one more shot down the road so hopefully that experience will be better."}
{"text":"I usually love coming here, it was my go to for breakfast. But I was EXTREMELY unpleased when I saw my order and several other orders being MICROWAVED!!!! $15 breakfast for microwaved food? Really? Different management or what because who pays for a microwaved breakfast...? Maybe you guys should hide the microwave from the guests..how embarrassing"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Much like many of the other breakfast places. I wish there was something that stood out.  I will come back and try some other stuff on the menu.  The wait staff was very good."}
{"text":"1 angry hangover + 1 large, steaming bowl of fresh, made in small batches says the chef oatmeal + berries, granola, brown sugar and milk.. = less painful reality and happy food belly."}
{"text":"Owners great us like we are family every time we go in! They seemed to have gotten rid of that other waitress I had mentioned in my last review! Food is ALWAYS amazing and service is more than great! We come here almost every weekend and they know us and some know our order! Great place!"}
{"text":"This place has the best coffee cakes ever! Always friendly service, and very fast and attentive! Staff always has great attitude considering they have to be there early hours and have to deal with all the grumpy old farts that come in they still hold it all together!"}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg is very similar to other popular \"egg\" breakfast joints but I don't believe they're under the same ownership. The restaurant is in a space that used to house a hipster slider joint so there are still remnants of a once trendy space.   The service and menu is pretty standard for this type of place. I would recommend trying the croissant French toast if you're not in the mood for eggs. Eggs are the star here. The coffee is not. It's so weak that it tastes like hot water with an almost indistinguishable hint of coffee."}
{"text":"Delicious food served fresh and hot! The warm coffee cake was a treat. The menu was large and varied. Friendly helpful staff. Fun decor to inspire you and encourage fun conversations. Will definitely return often."}
{"text":"This whole chain is just incredible. There are a few things that I didn't like about this location in particular so ill start with those.  Cons:  -Its a bit crowded on the inside and the tables seemed smushed together. -It took forever for us to get our check, which is always frustrating. -The line at the register took FOREVER.  Pros: - Food was awesome, always is. - The muffins are just so soft and when the butter melts on them you instantly want more. -When you have the waiters attention, they are all yours. They focus on you and your order. But then again maybe that's the hold up. Whoknows."}
{"text":"Had the cinnamon pancakes and they were very good.  Loved every bite. The coffee was just okay. Order something a little darker. The potatoes were cooked crispy the way I like them. Bacon was good quality. A good spot for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is a decent place for breakfast.  It has all that you want in the typical American breakfast, eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffles, you name it.  It's fine.  The portion sizes are decent, and the price is what you'd expect.  Nothing really stands out as amazing, but nothing to sneeze at.  The decor at the entrance of the restaurant is cool, somewhat vintage, which I like, including a sign that \"Unaccompanied children will be given an espresso and a new puppy.\"    The location is what makes this a great option.  It is on the corner of Charleston and Hualapai in Summerlin, a prime spot if you're on your way to Red Rock or live in the area.  Not that many free-standing breakfast joints around."}
{"text":"Our dining experience was amazing! Our server was very kind and our food came quickly, even though it was a full house. Our food was flavorful and filling. The coffee cake that was available for the day was Lemon, I was a little hesitant to try it but I'm glad I did! It was delicious!"}
{"text":"I wasn't ready for the goodness of The Cracked Egg. To be fair, my friend did forewarned me that I would love it. She knows me well! I was hooked. All three times that I visited the Cracked Egg there was no wait time, one of those days was on a weekend.    The space is clean and spacious.  Super friendly and accomodating staff.   What I had and recommend...  - The eggs benedict - French toast - Bacon, egg, and cheese on a croissant. - Coffee  Warning: No wifi; which means people have to talk to each other. I loved that. Get off the phones and eat up people.  I can't wait to go back to Las Vegas just to go to The Cracked Egg."}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg is very overrated.  For a breakfast place, it's just okay.  There are many other coffee shops in Vegas that serve a better breakfast.  I ate there twice only because I had a groupon.  I would not eat there if I had to pay full price."}
{"text":"Food was acceptable, I would rather go to Dennys and will next time.   Eggs were great, the thick bacon is not very thick, they don't have hash browns and the waffle was thin but again,  overall it was good."}
{"text":"Loved the biscuit and gravey with poached egg...omg so good. Service was fast and food was hot. Cant ask for anything better."}
{"text":"I have came here twice with my boyfriend! It reminds me of an older 50's diner. It's reasonably cheap, quick and easy. The service is great. But both times sadly, the food has had an issue. Like the temperature being cold or the eggs cooked wrong. It's just small things, but they could be better."}
{"text":"Nice little place in LV. Had the biscuits and gravy - gravy was pretty good. Drive a bit to try it out!!!"}
{"text":"The food was bland and the staff was rude. This place may have been best years ago, but has gone down hill. After our meal, we felt sick.  Bring Alka seltzer if you do decide to test your fate and eat here"}
{"text":"I enjoyed. Would have enjoyed even more had they had mimosas  lol - but that's just me tho.  Very friendly server, food was really good. I'll be back. I have a pic but this silly Yelp app won't let me add it."}
{"text":"I come here at 12 for lunch sometimes , and it a great place, the Turkey melt is what I always get. Their season potatoes is a must! . Would always recommend to anyone ."}
{"text":"If you want breakfast I'd say go to Denny's or IHOP instead. They seem to nickle and dime you here, so be aware of that. I wanted a waffle topped with lovely fresh fruit. Sadly I was underwhelmed. Bananas and strawberries were ok. The blueberries looked like a normal blueberry's embarrassing cousin. It's what I imagine the blueberries in a boxed muffin mix to look like. By the time I was done with my one waffle my boyfriend had annihilated his omelet, hash browns, and pancakes before I could try anything of his. Damn ectomorphs. He said it was all great though."}
{"text":"LOVE! I've never had anything that I didn't like. I'll get a skillet of some kind and get the coffee cake usually. You get so much food! I'm always so full when I leave! I'll usually take the coffee cake home and save it for later. Everything is cooked well and flavored very well. The staff is always very friendly and always checks to see how things are. Not very expensive. Perfect little breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and never had a bad meal or horrible service :-) They are wonderful with children too! My toddler started getting restless and the waitress came right over with goodies in hand to help calm my little one down :-) Yummy food, sweet and attentive servers, good prices, why eat any place else? Plus when your done eating just go across the drive way and hit some golf balls on the painted desert golf course :-) Perfect Sunday morning"}
{"text":"I was driving around looking for a breakfast spot and found The Cracked Egg on Yelp.  All sounded great so I stopped by.    The restaurant was very clean and the hostess very welcoming.  I ordered the Big Bad Wolf Omelette and of course after reading the Yelp reviews the coffee cake.    The Omelette was huge!!  Cooked to perfection and the meat within so delicious!  The coffee cake was amazing to the palette!  No wonder so many mention it on Yelp!  I can't believe this place isn't just 5 Star rating all around just for the coffee cake!     The Cracked Egg will definitely be one of my first stops on my next visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Brunch used to be one of my fav. meals EVER. But, since moving here, we've noticed that LV is not as much of a brunch town as some of its Northeastern, Midatlantic and Midwestern neighbors (We miss you Chi... SNIFF). So, when one of my girls suggested the Cracked Egg for brunch recently, I couldn't say \"I'm in\" fast enough.   I knew that there were others, like me, who missed brunch when I saw a line the size of India outside this resto. But, when I had my first bite of the GVR (the avocado, muenster, egg white combo is stellar!), I realized that people line up not JUST because they miss brunch BUT ALSO because the food here is delish!   Whatever your reason for coming to the Cracked Egg, you will be in for a treat. Service is great. The food is tasty. And, for a reasonable price (it came to about $100 incl. a 20% tip for 8 of us), you will have a great brunch.   A word to the wise: these folks will accommodate your meal to suit your request so don't be shy to ask. Also, if you order toast and don't want it to arrive pre-buttered, make sure to preference \"Dry\" toast. The same is true for \"Light\" cheese, egg whites (in place of eggs), and subbing the potatoes (the seasoned potatoes are awesome!) for fruit or cottage cheese."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday morning for brunch. We sat outside since it was a nice warm day and thankfully, there were misters. I got the Southwest Scramble and iced coffee. The portions here are big so I had trouble finishing my plate but it was delicious! Service was a little slow at times but they were busy that day. I just wish they'd have more people on the staff to check on people outside, as well. That being said, it was a great breakfast over all and I'd definitely come back to try more on the extensive menu :)"}
{"text":"Diner-style breakfast in a clean, nice atmosphere. One of my favorite breakfast places in Las Vegas. They have a huge menu, many of the breakfasts come with delicious, warm coffee cake. Sooo good!"}
{"text":"The food here is great.  I made my own skillet and the stuff weighed like 3 lbs, and I happened to finish it all.  The service was excellent, the quality was amazing, and the coffee cake was pretty damn good.  It is a little pricey just for breakfast, but I believe you get your bang for your buck.  They have a pretty good selection on their menu.  I'll definitely be back there again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is pretty typical of a breakfast place. I wanted their breakfast special of two eggs meat potatoes and toast. Since I don't eat pork, I asked if we could have turkey bacon instead. The waitress thought it would be okay if it was a dollar of charge. And that was fine with me. But when she asked the manager, the manager said no. You have to take the special as it is. I do understand that perspective however since I don't eat pork that was my only option. I went ahead and ordered it with the bacon and gave the bacon to the Cook's. I just feel it was very poor customer service. It doesn't happen that often I'm quite sure there's no difference in cost. Our waitress was wonderful however. She constantly kept it would make sure that everything was okay."}
{"text":"Raspberry stuffed french toast.......enough said"}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy was gross! Not to mention way over priced, over $30 for 2 people, come on now"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot.  The Coffee cake is very soft and moist. I want more! Cracked egg sandwich was good.   Lucy scramble was normal. Overall,  good breakfast  spot."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed a good breakfast. Mom always said that it's the days most important meal - here, breakfast never fails.   I've been going to this location for a few years now. Im there for lunch half the time, and the other half is when I call in for a pick up.   Denny's doesn't even come close. The reason I like it here is because I like Cracker Barrel. So if you're looking for a Cracker Barrel alternative - find your nearest Cracked Egg."}
{"text":"Food is fresh fresh fresh!!! Taste lean and clean . The restaurant has a nice ambience. This was my second visit and even more satisfied"}
{"text":"Great Breakfast and Lunch options and the AC is perfect!  The pancakes are amazing. The servers are super nice and easy to tall too.   They have colors and drawing for the children. Also has a diner style bar for seating. Perfect for families and couples."}
{"text":"The food was the quality we always expect and the service was awesome! Thanks Juan for being attentive and happy. He was always by the table to service but not too much that it was annoying. Great Service! My in-laws were very impressed! Good way to start our Sunday."}
{"text":"Hungry fam was in search for good breakfast place in our new area. I think we found it. Wasn't as busy, sat our family down of 5 on arrival. Our waitress \"Tracey\" was amazing and really nice. She took our orders by memory and repeated it back to us accurately. She recommended the peanut butter and jelly coffee cake which was the BOMB. It was moist and warm. I could go back for just coffee and coffee cake. My husband and I shared a country fried steak with gravy, didn't know we could do half Hash brown and half seasoned potatoes and that's what we did. Country fried steak was good, it wasn't as heavy. So I didn't feel bad eating it. The kids got the banana choc chip with eggs and bacon. Also the Monte cristo which was some sort of ham and cheese stuff French toast if im not mistaken.   Overall, the experience was great. Great food, great staff, food was quick, reasonable price (maybe a tad higher) but with all said and eats...we will be back!   Thank you Yelpers for the pick! Happy eats!!"}
{"text":"Always has an amazing staff.. food is always up to par.. great prices and even better environment.. definitely my favorite place to eat breakfast!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I have been for breakfast many times, so I have not tried their lunch menu yet.  The food is Fantastic, the prices are great & the staff is always friendly.  They have great healthy options & rediculously delicious UNhealthy options too :) Even when they are crowded, we never have to wait too long.  Plus as a bonus, there is usually a 'BOGO' coupon in the LV Weekly!"}
{"text":"As solid as a place like this gets. This is run of the mill breakfast diner food consistently executed very well and with great service."}
{"text":"We have lived here 5 years before finally trying this place, and do not understand what the fuss is all about.  Fairly disinterested wait staff, not friendly at all.  French toast was thin and soggy.  Potatoes were bland and boring with too much Lawry's seasoning.  My eggs were runny. Daughter's scrambled were ok.  Am 100% sure they microwaved the coffee cake before bringing it out. Every item was horribly overpriced.  Not giving lowest rating because coffee was good and Portuguese sausage were good.  We will not eat here again."}
{"text":"As others noted, I too noticed a considerable lack of good, creative brunch spots in Vegas.  Most places are the same ol', same ol'.  Eggs, bacon, hashbrowns.  The Cracked Egg doesn't deviate too much from this standard. It mostly offers typical breakfast fare - an assortment of omelets, pancakes, scrambles, etc.  If you're in the mood for something relatively unique they do have plenty of options for interesting omelet combinations, a delicious benedict ole (heart attack on a plate), and their \"coffee cakes\" - a standard side with many of the menu items - are divine (and flavors vary daily, it's not your typical coffee cake, they must use smooth as silk cake flower and maybe add in sour cream or something to give it creaminess and tang).  My favorite standard is the huevos rancheros.  A simple tasty sauce covers refried beans, eggs how you like them, sitting on a flour tortilla and topped with melted cheese and jalapenos.  It's simple, but they do it well.  Not too much cheese (I really don't need to eat 12 oz of cheese in a given meal like some places believe), medium spicy peppers, and plenty of beans, just how I like it!  It's not the most unique food you can find (although it's as unique as any I've found in this city) nor is it on the top of the healthy list, but it's satisfying and consistent, reasonably priced, and has become my weekend go-to place!"}
{"text":"You know I have been here over 25 times, and revisted the other day.  They lost a step somewhere, or I would give them a 5star here, but I do love the food, its super breakfast filler, 4stars is recommended, service is stellar, sometimes a wait on weekends, but not more that 20 min.   I like the benedicts, and the griddle meals and omelets.  Heck the Oatmeal is good.   $10 a head.   4star reliability, simple old time breakfast with spices and fresh oj and coffee."}
{"text":"I LOVE BREAKFAST. Well, I love food in general, but breakfast is happiness. I LOVE a great breakfast restaurant. After being torn away from Walker Brothers in Highland Park, IL when we moved to Vegas, I was desperate to find a comfortable, relaxed, no hassle breakfast eatery. Cracked Egg is one of them.  Their menu is great. I love that they have many different options: salad, soup, chili, omelet, chicken sandwiches and even burgers. I'm the kind of person that could eat a Thanksgiving dinner at 6:00AM, so variation is key. However, the more important is their massive gluten free menu. Cracked Egg's GF menu is one of the largest I've ever seen at any restaurant. PLUS, I could eat their seasoned potatoes and/or hash browns. I stuck with the hash browns because there is a small chance of cross contamination, but I was not disappointed; they were delicious!  It took me 15 minutes to make up my mind as to what to eat, and of course, when the waitress came to the table I changed my mind last minute and got the North Shore Scramble. Holy freaking happiness. Eggs were cooked perfectly, not runny but not dried out. All the ingredients were fresh, and those hash browns may have been standard, but you have no idea how great it was to 1. Eat hash browns without getting gluten-ed and 2. Too many places mess up hash browns and make my frown like a sad panda.The bacon was nice and crispy and gave it nice saltiness. I considered ordering another dish, the chili skillet, just to ensure the explosion of my stomach, but alas, I could not eat anymore.  My fiance ordered the standard eggs with kielbasa. Oh that kielbasa melted in my mouth - it was pure fatty processed foody goodness. I don't care what it's made out of. The kielbasa was great when smushed inbetween slices of toast and eggs. Thankfully, he gave me a couple bites of the kielbasa before he gluten-ed up his plate. I'm a huge fan of them cooking it on the flat top/griddle. The outside had a great snappy crust on it and was not too greasy. Oh, yummy pork product, I love you.  I will absolutely come here again, probably for their chili skillet. Yes, their chili skillet is gluten free. Gluten free chili at a restaurant other than Wendy's?!? YES PLEASE!!! Chili and I have a love affair every football season, but I think I will cheat on it soon and enjoy it at The Cracked Egg in a couple weeks. Or maybe I will have one of their sandwiches that is wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun. Yes, this way I can rationalize eating 400 calories of moo-cow...because it's wrapped in veggies! Thank you Cracked Egg. Good service, delicious food and a great restaurant environment. Love.  P.S. Anytime you want to make gluten free coffee cake, please let me know and I will taste test it for you!  P.P.S. They have GF pancakes. I know exactly what I'm getting next time!"}
{"text":"The food & service were good. My steak was tender & flavorful The coffeecake that came with was really fluffy & delicious. The portions were big, they have turkey sausage (big plus) & the prices are fair."}
{"text":"I like this cute breakfast restaurant more than a few of the other similar pancake/omelette/Benedict places we've been to. Felt cleaner too. Our server was one of the sweetest.. the type of girl who will brighten your morning without over doing it. She was more than helpful, again, without overdoing it. Wish I remembered her name.. brunette with a pixie haircut and i think she had a small tat on the back of her neck.. tiny frame, sweet eyes & smile. Sorry .. girl crushing for a split sec there. Anyway, we went on a Sunday and the wait was long of course but it was worth it. Love the booth seating and the service overall was perfect, especially on such a busy morning. Oh and our meal was delicious. I had the Veggie Benny and hubby had Buttermilk Pancakes, scrambled eggs and an order of bacon & sausage. Omg soo good."}
{"text":"We discovered The Cracked Egg two years ago on a prior visit to Vegas.  After a great experience we added it to the itinerary for this trip.  Aside from the Home Goods-Happy decorating choices, everything about this place is great.  Food portions are huge, quality is spot on and bellies were full!  We had a server named Amanda from San Diego and she was truly just a joyful human.  Always smiling, accommodating and helpful.  The best service we have had out this entire week in Vegas.  If you read my reviews, I'm not easily impressed but credit where its due...here's to Amanda, great food and great service!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this since it reminded me of a couple other \"Breakfasty style places\" here in Las Vegas, but this is super close to home.  I have had two great meals here! And look forward to more!  Once was on a weekday, it was delightfully quiet, had great service and the food came out really quickly! Not a single complaint!!  The next time was on a Sunday, definitely not quiet..Because clearly the food is good! Not a problem, put our name on the list, sauntered over to StarBucks in Smiths (10 steps away), and headed back. With in minutes we were seated! The Cracked Egg does not crack when they are slammed! That is a good sign! OK, maybe the young male host looked a little shell shocked, but I assume he is new? But worry not, the seasoned girls kept it ALL together! Like a well oiled breakfast machine! A coffee station upfront while you are waiting could be a nice touch, but now I am just being nit-picky. I would happily go back anytime!  Over all, rock solid 4 star food! Great service! And an easy price point. What is not to love about all of that?"}
{"text":"Good gravy!  Good God!  You get a TON of food.  I am still full and i ate there in December.  The omelette I ordered had a TON of avocados on it.  Usually they put like 3 and call it a California Omlette.  But no.  They put like 7 slices.  And did I mention the gravy and biscuits?  Off the strip, waaaay off the strip.  Thats how to appreciate Vegas."}
{"text":"First time customers, and I won't be our last. I had eggs , corned beef hash and home fries, the wife had spinach eggs benedict and home fries- we finished both our plates. Our waitress was awesome!! We will definitely be coming back. Its really hard to find excellent service, and a good breakfast at an affordable price. The cracked egg just became our new favorite place, we can't wait to try out the other menu items."}
{"text":"First time visitor and we will return! Good service, great selection of food for reasonable prices"}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg, I want to like you so bad!  The service here is actually really good. They staff was super attentive and I never had to ask for a water refills, but my server was very sassy in a TV sitcom sort of way. She tried to make little quirky jokes every time she came to the table, but they just came off like she was mad at the world and we were the cause of it. Like I said very TV sitcom-ish.   The decor here needs to be updated desperately. It has a cafeteria look; very open and very cold, but with a country grandma style. By this I mean there's random farm and rooster decor on the walls. Which makes me laugh because roosters don't lay eggs. It's Science!   The food is tasty, but basic. I was here with four other people and I tried everyone's dish... I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Salad; the salad for the guy who never orders salad. This was great in my opinion, big chunks of chicken coated in buffalo sauce on huge bed of fresh greens w/ eggs and tomatoes. My foodie friends ordered the \"Veggie Benny\", \"The Cobb\", and the \"Pesto Scramble\".   The \"Veggie Benny\" was the star in this line-up. This plate comes with spinach, avocado, grilled tomatoes and two poached eggs. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the hollandaise sauce was creamy, but lite in an interesting way, and the hash browns were golden brown and crispy. I would most likely order this if I came back to the Cracked Egg. The other dishes were forgetful and don't need to be mentioned in this review.   This place needs a design overhaul and few updates on the menu. These simple changes could really elevate this place...Where's Robert Irvine?!?  Pro Tip: The baked goods in this place are steller. Try the Blueberry Muffin/Coffee Cake"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here today and was very pleased with everything. The server was very friendly a little slow but I can understand being it was so packed on a Sunday morning. The wait to be seated was said at 15-20 minutes and it was about 15 minutes I'd say. But I ordered the raspberry French toast and a side of sausage links, it was very delicious! I have never seen where someone took French toast and between the bread is like a raspberry jam or filling. Was topped with fresh raspberries that tasted like it came right off the plant! Very goooood! Then the sausage was the nice big thick links which I love and they were delicious also! Came to around 14$ for the meal not including the tip so to me was worth it. I also liked the place it self with the decorations and the way they have it set up ;). Definitely will be coming back to try the peanut butter French toast next!"}
{"text":"I literally live a block away from the cracked egg so I come here often when I am craving some good breakfast food.  There usually isn't a wait unless it is Saturday or Sunday morning between 8-12.  In that case, the most you usually would have to wait is 30-45 minutes to get a table.    Everything here is very affordable ranging between $7-15 dollars for a large portioned meal.    My favorites at cracked egg:  The Monte Cristo Turkey, ham and swiss cheese sandwich dipped in french toast batter and deep fried. served with hash browns or seasoned potatoes.  This is absolutely amazing and hits so many of your senses that it will confuse you but it is delicious!    Coconut Macadamia Short stacks are a great side to add to any of the meals.  If you are looking for a healthier option, the oatmeal overload is a HUGE bowl of oats, loaded with nuts, raisins, berries, and granola on the side.    Another one of my favorites is The Country Benny:  a biscuit split and topped with patty sausage, two poached eggs and smothered in gravy  Overall, I am a big fan of the cracked egg.  The service has always been friendly and prompt.  The food is good and affordable."}
{"text":"This is a great little place for breakfast. They offer lunch items, too. Although, I have only had breakfast. the atmosphere is great & small. The staff is friendly & prompt. Everyday the offer a coffee cake (instead of toast if you prefer) & it is never the same flavor. Its nice to have something different everyday, You can also get all egg white at no extra charge. I highly recommend this place. My son only wants to eat here for breakfast. Which is fine by me."}
{"text":"I am a creature of habit and this is my spot.  2-3 times a week for me. Been going her for over 10 years. I also like consistency which is what I get.  This would be my diner if I had a TV show about me."}
{"text":"It's really more like 3.5 stars.  Better than 'OK' but not like I'm a total Fan... I mean... it's a really good breakfast but they don't serve bloody marys... so.... ya know.  Service: Got there a little before 8am... there were a few people in line but we were seated quickly... and the busser got us our coffees and waters really quick... and then we waited for like 15 minutes.  Our waitress was slammed and she was 1 of only 2 working at the moment. She was really nice and efficient. Our food was delivered quickly... and hot.  Food: Taste.... right on!  I ordered the Veggie Benny... and it came with lots of avocado slices which I love!  The side of potatoes were 'ok'...nothing special... they need seasoning or something but I don't really need the extra starch... so I left them.  The hubby had the croissant breakfast sandwich and that looked good... I didn't get a taste because I was too excited about the yummy avocados on my dish.  The FIL got the oatmeal overload.... WOW!  It came with fresh berries, cream, raisins, brown sugar and almond slivers on the side... and a huge bowl of oatmeal.  Looked Great and he was happy with it so thumbs up.  Will I be back?  For Sure.  :)"}
{"text":"I live next to this place and I feel lucky.  It's a great spot for a great, fresh breakfast.  The veggies are always fresh and not pre-frozen like at some other spots and their pancake options are delicious."}
{"text":"The corn beef hash was just so so. The corn beef was not \"hashed\".Waitress should have warned me not to order the hash brown because there is already potatoes under the corn beef.  Should have sub it with fruits.  This breakfast place  is exactly what this area needs. Flooded with natural light,  cheerful and airy. Waiting stuff was friendly.  Next time I'll just order eggs over easy, toast and coffee. Other stuff on the menu looks too heavy."}
{"text":"Service was pleasant and quick.  Ambiance was light and airy, with comfortable booths.  They had a great kids menu, where they can draw and color.  Food was a little bland.  I had the veggie croissant, bf got the pesto scramble with chicken.  Friend got the carnitas omelette.  It was good but heavy.  Coffee cake was good.  It was about $10 an entre.  Overall, just okay."}
{"text":"Walked up and huge line of people, didn't realize they were all waiting to pay their checks. Seated after not even waiting 5 minutes, ordered just a regular breakfast of sunny side eggs/bacon/fries/toast. My friend got a chicken/jalapeño skillet. Waiter was attentive, refilled our teas. Food was decent. My only complaint was the bathroom, there's a sign it's under construction but stinks sooooo bad. Almost smells like a funky sewage smell. I walked in -got a whiff & walked right out, such a gross & nauseating smell. I know they're in the process of renovating but made my stomach churn."}
{"text":"Food is AMAZING. Service is very nice! Location is beautiful and clean and very comfortable. Hard not to hang out all morning  10/10"}
{"text":"First of all I would like to start off by saying how much I used to love the Cracked Egg. My boyfriend and I basically go every Saturday...so with that being said, I was REALLY ASTOUNDED by what happened today...  BUGS IN OUR FOOD. THE FOOD-ON THE PLATE-EVERYWHERE.  My boyfriend ordered the croissant french toast, and I got one of the egg scrambles. All was fine, and then I saw a little brown bug crawling on the side of my boyfriend's plate. I looked closer, and saw literally 5 of them...and then more...I immediately told him to stop eating. We called our server over and she took the plate away. I then decided I couldn't eat because I was so insanely grossed out. The server then brought over our check and charged us for everything except my boyfriend's meal. I DIDN'T EVEN EAT MY MEAL (A FEW BITES) BECAUSE OF HOW DISGUSTED BY THE BUGS I WAS.  The manager didn't even come to our table to apologize or anything. The server just took my boyfriend's meal off the check and that was that. So my boyfriend decided to find the manager. After 5 minutes of searching the small restaurant for her, she came out and seemed ANNOYED to talk to him. She had a smug \"don't care\" attitude. My boyfriend is wayyyy too nice in my opinion...and the manager said that this is \"the food industry and that bugs happen\". !!!!!!!!!!!! What!!! management should never ever tell their patrons that. My boyfriend then asked her how she would feel if she had bugs in her food and her reply, \"well, i grew up around animals so I wouldn't have cared.\" !!!!!!! What!!!!!!!!!!!! Finally after the manager made my boyfriend feel like an idiot for \"politely\" complaining, she said, \"ok, if it'll make you happy, i'll take off your girlfriends meal too.\" That wasn't even it! It was the principle behind everything!!!!!!  I teach service recovery in the hospitality for a living and that was the most piss poor excuse of a manager I have ever encountered.  NEVER EVER going there again. I'm extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"EDIT: I had a lot of gripes at first, but I've been back since with a pleasant experience. The parking was only bad the first time and the food was better quality. My wife loves the Benedict.  The first thing I noticed was the terrible parking lot. There are way too many businesses in the shopping center for the size of the parking lot.  Parking aside, I heard great things about this place, so I was looking forward to breakfast. Also, the place was packed, so I assumed the food would be good. It was. The portions were big, and the service was good.  Their breakfast was a little better than IHOP, but priced twice as much. A breakfast for two was $28. A couple of basic omelets, potatoes and drinks for $28? How in the world does this place justify these ridiculous prices?   Advice to management: You blew it on the location with the parking lot, but there's nothing you can do about it now. Cut the price and cut the portions. No one wants to take an omelet home for leftovers.  Fix the value, and I'll give it 4*, because the food was as expected and the staff was pleasant."}
{"text":"I'm a lover of Corned Beef Hash & Eggs so I thought I would try it. Far from the best and I think they skimp on portion for what they charge. Service and coffee was Great"}
{"text":"Top of the line breakfast! Been going there for 4 years straight. Love the stuffed peanut butter jelly French toast. But my favorite will always be the orange marmalade French toast yummy!! Great service great environment great attitude."}
{"text":"I want something other than the Omelet House and Jamm's to run to for breakfast, and I decided to finally try out the Cracked Egg.  Located in a small business center, this breakfast place is busy and we had to wait for a few minutes to grab a table.  When you walk in, it's a typical breakfast diner setting with interesting trinkets and artwork around.  The menu is nice and simple and the service is great.  I ordered a denver omelette and my husband grabbed corned beef hash and eggs.  We had to try their muffin cake thing, and it was goood.  I know they microwave it to heat it up, but it still tastes pretty awesome.  As for the breakfast items, they were not greasy, nice and hot, and very yummy.  Everything was seasoned well and cooked perfectly.  I've yet to eat lunch here or try anything else on the menu, but once I do I'll be sure to update my review.  If you want a nice, quick breakfast for a reasonable price--and a great dessert cake muffin to start--grab a quick eat at this place.  it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in  years id say!!! Super clean, super neat, wonderful customer service, and for the first time you get what you pay for!  Not the cheap diner places where everything tastes the same, and not  the fancy shmancy brunch places where you pay $40 for eggs!  To bad is 260 miles away for me, but for sure anytime id go to vegas id stop there!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Friday morning and my party of 2 was seated right away. Service was generally pretty quick even though the place seemed packed. I got the chile verde rancheros and at first sight it didn't look like much. It just looked like a big blob of food haha but every bite was delicious. Kind of tastes like a chimichanga lol overall, a great place for breakfast/brunch. They have a huge variety of food to choose from and the staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"My brother and I just had lunch there. Fast friendly service. had the mushroom swiss burger and substituted salad for usual fries. The burger was great, but the salad could have used a better dressing. The burger and a drink or just over 11 bucks."}
{"text":"ummm coffee cake sooooo fresh and delicious!!! WOWZA! this place had some amazing food and great fast service! I loved my breakfast coming into town meeting friends there was a perfect way to start my Vegas trip. The menu is filled with so many selections that the average Joe would have a hard time deciding which to choose! You want a good affordable breakfast, or any other meal this would be the yum spot!"}
{"text":"Love this place and we go all the time. Awesome coffee cake and delicious egg dishes! Always hard to choose which one to get - they're all so good!!"}
{"text":"If you don't want to deal with the buffets on the strip...this is the next best place to have breakfast. At first by the environment you'd think that the food would be sub-par at best...boy I have never been so happy to be wrong. This place is amazing!"}
{"text":"I just love their pancakes here!   The service here is usually good. We've been coming here every weekend for breakfast and the staff knows us already. But there are times that we will be seated with servers who are not as attentive.   But the food is always good. No complaint so far."}
{"text":"I have been here for breakfast a few times and it is average at best. Small and somewhat bland portions with ok service.  Looking around for another local cafe as I am relatively new to the area. Anyone have any suggestions??"}
{"text":"Every time I come here it gets better and better. I've loved everything I've eaten from here! Everyone is so nice too.  The coffee cake is a must. Even if it's a flavor that doesn't sound too appealing, they do it WELL.  I come here every time I'm in Vegas. They need to open one in California and I'll go broke"}
{"text":"It's a small place but the food and service are great. Be prepared to wait on the weekends because it is a popular spot. I can't leave without getting the coffee cake...it is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the veggie Benny and husband had the big bad wolf. Watched food sit in the window for just over three minutes while server was chatting with a colleague. Food was not seasoned with the exception of the cayenne the server added while still in the window. Eggs were not poached properly. In the interest of time, informed server but did not want meal remade. A sever that overheard me came over and argued with me, then my server came back and argued with me as well. I find it distasteful when servers argue with a customer in any circumstance. I was appalled that I was treated this way considering I did not request a new meal, a discount or even an apology. Will not return."}
{"text":"The Service is great, the Food is awesome. Coffee cake yummy, pancakes fabulous . I recommend this place whenever u r in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with my buddy. Ordered waffles & eggs for myself cause I love those things. It was great. Server was pleasant."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast, and it has some of the best New England Clam on fridays.  I am a big fan of the hangover special they have occasionally, and have yet to have a dish I didn't like there.  You have to try the coffee cake."}
{"text":"The place was busy and the food was okay. The staff was friendly and the food was ready very quick. For the price, you can't beat it. The eggs lacked a certain flavor/texture that I like, but overall the meal was good. I would go back."}
{"text":"i am a breakfast girl. morning, afternoon, and my favorite...night! i went here for a late breakfast one morning after the boy constantly hints that he craves it. he use to be a regular here apparently and i caught that as soon as we walked in. the servers knew him and remembered him (by name) all the way to what he orders. he loves the lowfat scramble without any green chilis. i ordered the veggie benny. (i'm a sucker for the benedicts and i love veggies.)  the waitresses and waiters were all very nice and attentive. the food came quickly. we had a bagel and banana in the meantime to snack on. when my veggie benny came i was in love with all the bright colors of it. pretty food! the only thing i didn't care for was when they said \"smothered in holliandaise sauce\" they really meant it. it took away some of the flavor of my fresh spinach and tomatos sadly. next time i will have to make sure to ask them to go easy. we shared my seasoned potatos and those were pretty good. greasy but good. i would give it 3 stars because it was pretty basic and for the holliandaise factor, but the service made me want to come back. everyone was very nice and the bill was cheap."}
{"text":"Standard breakfast and brunch only establishment.   So far have only tried a GVP omelet, club sandwich and the huevos rancheros. Nothing special taste-wise, but the service was fairly fast, as is the common expectation in these types of eateries.  Expect a 10-20 minute wait on weekends. Never been there during the workweek."}
{"text":"Tried the Pancho Omelette. No regrets there. Staff was friendly and helpful with the entire process. I will definitely try them out one more time before I skip town."}
{"text":"Great service, seated us right away. Food delicious especially the coffee cake! Would visit again"}
{"text":"This breakfast place is absolutely \" gross\" and certainly not what peopled  \"Jacked\"this place to be this great breakfast place . My omelette was tasteless and cold . And the infamous coffee cake......really .. I will not return  The service was poor . The food is overpriced, and certainly not worth the Drive. The reputation of this establishment does not meet the quality. Extremely disappointing!,,,,,,,"}
{"text":"Service was slow prices to high and they don't care enough to give a military discount or senior discount"}
{"text":"This place seem small and a bit confusing. Its in an area that you usually won't find a sit down restaurant. I guess its an okay location, but it looks like a place would be fitting for retail stores like Radio Shack or GNC. Doesn't really fit very well, but it is a nice place.   Inside was a bit decent, a bit roomy and seems clean. When we did get to our booth, we did find it odd that one side is roomy then the other side of the booth.   The staff seem kind of nice. The one who sat us down in our booth, didn't seem to happy. But the waitress that took our order was upbeat. The busser on the other hand, had issues. I'm sure there are a softer way to put dishes in a bucket, instead of making clanging sounds, to the point where it irritates our ears and makes us twitch every time he drops a plate in the bucket. So that was kind of annoying, either he doesn't know how to be gentle with dishes, or he's not really happy that he has to make the dishes clang and make us twitch. Uncool, unprofessional, and uncalled for.   The only thing that's making this okay, is the food, the nice setting and the waitress being nice. Otherwise I would of probably experience better if the staff look like they didn't want to work.   The food on the other hand, I really enjoyed. Had the steak and eggs and cooked to my satisfaction. So I give the cooks a very good recognition as well.   I guess, if you don't mind some of the staff being unhappy and there for the food. Then I would recommend it. Otherwise, I would try something else, if you want to be in a more upbeat kind of place that won't make you feel uncomfortable."}
{"text":"You need to try their coffee cake. It's so good!!! Great Breakfast & Brunch spot. Love the cafe style atmosphere. Always busy on a Sunday after church. Very homey, and relaxed. Food is yummy. The skillets are a must-try. I have yet to try the pancakes or french toasts...maybe during our next stop I will."}
{"text":"Visiting from L.A. and just happened upon The Cracked Egg so went in for breakfast. The food was very good and boy did you get plenty of it. Would definitely come back and also recommend it. My waitress Tori was wonderful. Very friendly and attentive, she made sure I had everything that I needed and kept my water glass full even though they were quite busy.  So nice to have a pleasant waitress and good food to start off the day in a good mood. Thumbs up to Tori and The Cracked Egg!!!"}
{"text":"I live at SW but went to this location. Good and fast service. I tried the pesto scramble and she tried the Lucy and we really liked it. The atmosphere was just kinda dark for a bf place. Would go back."}
{"text":"Great omelletes!  Even though the wait was painfully long, definitely worth the wait.  It is an A+ alternative to the chain breakfast diners!  Will return!"}
{"text":"Had the gluten free turkey Pesto sandwich. The bread was delicious and had a perfectly made Pesto sauce. May have to go back on this trip to have again. Also got the side of fruit. Had delicious pieces of watermelon, cantaloupe and grapefruit. As we were leaving it was really filling up. Popular place for great reason!"}
{"text":"The service here is good but the food isn't anything special...  Its a great place to grab a quick breakfast. Typical breakfast menu plus some healthy choices."}
{"text":"Our go-to breakfast place.  Always a wait, but always worth it; eat outside if you can stand to, you'll be in and out in no time!  Menu is so great, I always have a favorite at every restaurant but here I have to decide between so many yummy things!  The coffee cake is wicked good and hits the spot for breakfast dessert ;)"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place. So welcoming. Food is great. This is my go to breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I've been there many times. Service is good and the food is ok, nothing special though. The last time I was there the hash browns were crispy but tasted as if they had sat around for a while, not fresh. Sometimes it hit and miss. It's close by so that's the main reason I go there."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my least favorite meal by far and I'll only go out for a weekend breakfast meal about 5 times a year. But when I do go, The Cracked Egg is one of the places I'll go to. Whenever I try to go on a Sunday the lines are out of the door so I recommend Saturdays. The restaurant has two separate dining rooms so there's plenty of seating, especially if you don't have many people in your party.  Their menu has a ton of variety. With most of the breakfasts you'll have a choice of toast or coffee cake and potatoes or hash browns. These are essentials for any solid breakfast spot. On this last trip my boyfriend and I shared the macadamia coconut pancakes and the green scramble. The pancakes are so good they've inspired me to try to recreate them at home. There's plenty of coconut shreds in each bite with the occasional crunch of macadamia nut. The dish comes with three huge pancakes and we were each only able to finish one. The green scramble was also delicious, filled with broccoli, chiles, spinach and chicken. The star of this show was for sure the green salsa. I could drink this salsa it was so fresh and yummy. I would order any dish on the menu that has this (they seem to offer a lot of Mexican inspired breakfasts).   The Cracked Egg is the perfect every-so-often stuff your face full of breakfast food and lay on the couch of the rest of the day. I can't do it very often but when I'm ready for it again and craving those coconut macadamia pancakes I will pretty much always choose to come here."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday morning....no waiting, got a table immediately.  Food was great and waitress was awesome.  Better than other Cracked Eggs I've been too in Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my parents for lunch had the North Shore Scramble, it's was better than I expected. Our service was good overall I would recommend stoping by if your ever in the area."}
{"text":"Had the Joes scramble with a side short stack, food was good hash browns were not the best but overall good food!"}
{"text":"Got to start off by saying that their mocha coffee cake was to die for and its been the only thing on my mind these past few days. It comes to your table with legit steam still, super hot, moist & delicious. I ordered a Denver omelette and it was great. I do have to say that Egg works Denver omelette was just the slightest bit better BUT.. The coffee cake and delicious potatoes at cracked egg will definitely be the reason I come back!"}
{"text":"This is my first visit and I will definitely be back! The menu has a large selection and build your own options if nothing suits you. The service was wonderful. Friendly, quick, drinks consistently filled with out asking, and the waitress was the perfect amount of interaction with us.   The home fries were a type of mashed potato and had a good taste. My omelet was delicious and my friend enjoyed her chicken fajita skillet too, calling it hearty and delicious. We finished our plates.   We also split their ultimate French toast and it was incredible! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Good coffee. Very friendly. Food portions were average for Las Vegas, my youngest had pancakes with eggs and bacon, pancakes were large, fluffy and moist. Hubby had corn beef hash with over easy eggs and it was hash as I have never seen it, like cut up slices of corn beef, tasted pretty good and not greasy at all. Older daughter had egg burrito with chorizo, she loved every bit and opted for fresh fruit in place of potatoes,  pieces of watermelon, cantaloupe and grapefruit. I had scrambled eggs with green onion and cream cheese, side of hash browns and in place of toast; coffee cake, coffee cake was amazing. Super moist and perfect amount of cinnamon, delicious. My eggs with cream cheese and green onions were flavorful and moist. Coffee hot and strong, service fast friendly and server stopped by many times to refill beverages. Bathroom cramped but very clean. Only 4 stars because I feel the price was a bit high. Over 50.00 for our meal. I don't know if that is average for off the strip, but for us So. Cal family it's a bit high. With all that said, will go back again."}
{"text":"Such a disappointment.  I really dislike giving a less then favorable reveiw of a restrurant when there are so many positive reviews. So let's start off on a good note. The staff at Cracked Egg are warm, friendly, and  accommodating, which is why I feel terrible for calling out their food as bland and tastless.   We really wanted to like the cracked Egg so badly, but the way to begin a meal is not with brunt black toast, over- cooked eggs/bacon, and undercooked potatoes. The entire meal from beginning to end just wasn't good.  I wasn't expecting a 5 star meal, however, I would have expected food that wasn't burnt or overcooked."}
{"text":"I been coming to \"Cracked Egg\" for some years now. I been to mostly all the locations around the Vally! And I can say that I've always had a great and good experience! The service the staff always very great at customer service and very welcoming! Not to mention the food here is amazing!!!!!! I will always be loyal customer"}
{"text":"Right down the street from my brothers spot.   Good Breakfast. \"Synthetic ambiance\". It'll be years before flavor meets flavor here. Know what I mean? Just imagine if Pork Store Cafe was serving food in a newly built office with booths. It just wouldn't be the same. 3.5 stars, rounded up because the digestibles were crackin."}
{"text":"I ordered a Mexican Skillet and my friend ordered a Western omelet with egg whites. Both of us got toast, which came already buttered. The skillet was delicious. I substituted hash browns for seasoned potatoes because I prefer a little crisp and it was perfect. There was a little bit more cheese than I preferred but still palatable. The coffee was good- even came with fresh vanilla creamer. Good service and good food. Can't ask for anything more."}
{"text":"This place would have gotten 4 stars if it weren't for my omelet being made wrong . When it was made correctly it was amazing. The coffee cake was so delicious I don't understand how some reviews say it's bad . The service isn't the best but it's not horrible. I just wish my omelet would have been correct so I could have eaten with my fiancé but u had to eat alone since I had to wait for a new one to be made."}
{"text":"The best brunch or breakfast spot in Vegas! I have to come and eat here at least once when visiting Vegas! Great friendly customer service snd outstanding food!"}
{"text":"I thought that this breakfast & lunch cafe was so-so. My omelette was a little on the bland & dry side, yet I ate it anyway due to having a huge appetite after being in a casino all night.   This cafe is on the busy side, and seats fill up quickly. Seating is somewhat limited within the front of the restaurant. I wound up sitting at the bar area where servers tend to leave silverware & napkins to be rolled next to my plate. Not cool. They apparently didn't get the hint after I pushed the silverware container away, remaining oblivious as to the reason why I moved it.  Check out needs to move faster. Only one cash register, and the line can get long to the point where your butt is in someone's face due to where they are sitting. That's no exaggeration.   Altogether, Cracked Egg is not bad. Its 24 hours, so it has that going for a local venue."}
{"text":"Ive been here once and it was probably the greatest experience ive had a breakfast place. It was my first time at a breakfast place and this is what youd expect after watching alot of 80s and 90s movies that have diners. it seems really authentic and just \"diner\" is a good word for it. The food is very close to home, u know, the whole, scrambled eggs, toast, bacon, and it overall made the breakfast experience greater because it was so familiar...   Id reccomend this to any family looking for a good breakfast place that is casual but if youre looking for something fancy, id look elsewhere. Also, a good date spot!"}
{"text":"Nothing out of this world. Food was good, did not eat there so I really cannot comment on service. I will say this, they were pretty fast."}
{"text":"Excellent food and plenty of food. The carnitas omelette was delicious. I will definitely come back here when visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We came to the cracked egg after a morning run. We chose them because of the good reviews and they were open before 8:00. We were not disappointed. They have a gluten sensitive menu that we ordered a blueberry muffin. That and both of our omelets were very good. They do have a kids menu but our little guy just ate off our plates. All in all very good!"}
{"text":"Having this place right around the corner makes me very, very happy! It's definitely a solid breakfast spot for when you don't feel like cooking but also don't feel like going to far. I wouldn't say you need to venture across town to check this place out... Definitely not that phenomenal of a breakfast spot but it's enough to satisfy the taste buds!   The first time I went, I was feeling adventurous and wanted to try something I had never had before! This being said, I went with the Monte Cristo. The dish in and of itself is out of the ordinary and I honestly REALLY enjoyed it! It was weird but a good weird! I would definitely get it again.   My second time (and third... And probably will again on my fourth visit) here I got the bacon cheeseburger skillet. I love this skillet! It's the perfect mix of lunch and breakfast in one plate!! Want a cheeseburger but want eggs and potatoes too? Boom! It's all right there in your skillet.   One day I do plan on trying an omelette of theirs that has polish sausage in it (being Polish, that'll be a real taste challenge!). When I do I'll be sure to let everyone know how it is!   The thing that makes this place truly awesome, is the service. I've never had a bad experience with the service here! Granted, I've somehow managed to get the same server the last two times I've been, it doesn't matter. From what I could see all the staff is friendly and on their game!   Like I said, not the kind of place you need to venture across town for, but if your in the neighborhood or live around the corner like me, than it's worth a stop!"}
{"text":"No veggies patties and the corned beef hash was subpar at best. For a diner so close to the state border, they really seemed uncomfortable with out of towners. Great coffee tho."}
{"text":"It started off rocky for us, place was packed full I was shocked we walked in and were seated right away.  Country themed, clean, calming and relaxing.  I really didn't care for the Corned Beef hash & my boyfriend's French toast was kind of sad, and too dark. We asked for the Manager,  Ashley was so nice she asked if she could get us anything else we'd like... we were unsure.  I decided I was craving French toast and I really can't eat it because I'm allergic to wheat.  So I ordered it for myself but really I was planning on eating two bites and making the bf have it since his first order was just bad.  The French toast was delicious the second time around, nice golden brown.  By that time the place has cleared out and I decided maybe I will get something I can eat since they passed my \"french toast test\". Let's be honest if a brunch place can't nail French toast I wouldn't of stuck around.  So I wasn't crazy about the Corned beef hash serving I had, I figured I'll come back and try it another day maybe without onion next time and decided on the \"garden omelet\" it has mushroom and spinach on it.  I ordered it from the Gluten Free menu, totally loved the fresh ingredients veggies and melted cheese.    **They're Gluten Free Menu is the biggest I've seen anywhere ELSE!**  We plan on going back and bringing more friends/family here because I prefer this place over the Egg & I.  I want to try the coffee next time too. I don't know what I was thinking a soft drink with Lunch."}
{"text":"..the menu is extensive and the food is very good... not gourmet (for that you must visit 'Kitchen Table' over on Horizon Ridge & Valley Verde).. .. but all items at TCE that we've tried so far we would readily order again, and the service is always sharp... ..if we can say anything needing improvement it's for management to get more involved when patrons get unruly, and just 'carry-on' uncontrollably.. ..today there was a group of young teens just completely out of control.. creating a noise disturbance that could be easily heard throughout the entire restaurant.. no one from the restaurant made any motion to limit their behavior in any way..  ..sorry.. that's just not acceptable.. we all are not going out to eat under those circumstances.. would hope/ and expect they pay more attention on behalf of ALL their customers in the future."}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg you have done it! Won my future business! I've been trying to find a couple more breakfast places to go to on a regular basis and it's been super difficult! I seem to live by tons of these breakfast places however the past few that I've been to have been hard to beat my all time favorite Pancake House!   This past Sunday as always I treated my mother to Sunday Brunch and told her that we would try a different place. The Cracked Egg was chosen based on the other errands that had to be ran in that area of town. When we pulled up I just knew the wait was going to be ridiculous based on the amount of cars that were parked outside, boy was I wrong! As I sat patiently waiting I couldn't help but notice all these cute little pictures and signs that had some interesting quotes on them. Less than a 10 minute wait we were seated and provided our menus! Customer service here is very good! Every staff member was smiling and greeting us and the whole vibe just seemed to be pleasant.   The variety of items on the menu is pretty good! There are tons of things I wanted to try but because an omelet was what my taste buds were screaming about I decided on \"The Big Bad Wolf\" Mom ordered \"The Garden Patch\". Who doesn't love cool names for the items they order? Some probably find it cheesy (no pun intended) but I love the creativeness! You get an option of potatoes, toast and coffee cake with any of the omelet's. Since I was already drooling over the previous YELPER's pics of the coffee cake I went with that of course! Something cool that they do is change the flavor of them every so often. Mine just happened to be apple! Yum! When our food arrived everything looked and tasted great! I had to give them a couple extra brownie points for nailing my request for egg whites on the omelet! Majority places NEVER get it correct and I always have to end up sending it back. Can't be trying to kill me with all that cholesterol!   Check out was great! Our cashier was friendly just like everyone else we encountered that morning! Asked how our dining experience was and even welcomed us back as soon as possible! I noticed as I was paying for our breakfast that they have a rewards program and when I fill this form out I could get $8 off the next breakfast! I can't wait to return! Awesome job guys!"}
{"text":"So this is the second time I been to this location and I remember why I didn't go back now.The food is not bad but it also is not anything to boost and holla about either. It's a little pricey for the for the taste of the food being so mediocre.   The place is small so it gets loud here very quickly as it starts to fill up. There is no outside seating either so that does not help with how loud and how packed it gets. There is no waiting area really, there is about 2 or 3 chairs if those are taken then you can go outside and sit at one of the 3 picnic tables if those are not full otherwise you stand around outside or sit in your car.  This time I got the build your own skillet with hot links, chorizo, bell peppers and spinach. The problem with was that the chorizo was dryer that sand at a beach the potatoes that come with it was not seasoned at all they tasted really bland (like I put them in a skillet waited to they were cooked and then started to eat them right away) then there was literally like 3 leafs of spinach in the whole thing, had me upset.  Then there is the coffee cake that's suppose to be on point, ummm no it is not. It tasted like white cake with some melted chocolate chips and some time of cream cheese glaze (what you would find on a cinnamon roll) it's served nice and hot but that's just trickery to make you think that you are getting a fresh slice but in reality they stuck it in the microwave before they bring it to you. Oh and the orange juice is the same price as a gallon in the store which I normally wouldn't have a problem with but the fact that it is such a small glass is where I run into the issue for that items.  The best part of the whole experience there was the waitress that waited on us. She prompt with everything and extremely nice as well. Also the food and drinks amen out quickly as well.  Well thanks for reading and have a good day."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service mixed with great food. Wait times can be long on weekends, but well worth it."}
{"text":"My daughter and I eat breakfast here once a week.  The service is fast and friendly (even if they are busy, it's worth a short wait).  The food is absolutely excellent and I love the warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this restaurant five stars mainly because I think their overall rating should be a solid four. We enjoyed good service and delicious food. I ordered the enchilada omelette minus the tortilla chips, and it was delicious. I substituted fresh fruit in place of the hash brown potatoes and it was the perfect way to end my meal.  We arrived around 9 AM on Saturday morning and we were seated right away. By the time we left there were a lot of people waiting for a table. I recommend this restaurant for a great breakfast, and we will come back again!"}
{"text":"Such a bad experience! Served orange juice with a piece of floating blue plastic! That's great! Next, serve me protein pancakes with a side of hair! Won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I make it apparent to come here at least once a week. We absolutely enjoy the atmosphere, the people and the food! Their country potatoes are my favorite! I'm a huge breakfast foodie and this place is at the near top of my list. Every once in awhile they trial new specials such as their chicken and waffles and cinnamon roll pancakes. SO DELICIOUS!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Daughter and I ate here for a late breakfast. I LOVE biscuits and gravy, but it often times doesn't like me. I took a chance this day. It was AMAZING!!! And best part, NO tummy ache. My meal came with hash browns and two eggs(I know, not a lo-cal meal, but so very tasty). It was busy, but service was prompt. I was so into my meal I don't recall what the daughter had, but she ate it all! We will be back. A must try! They have lunch, too."}
{"text":"We came here during the lunch break of our workshop. The food was diner-quality but we had a good time. The server was kind, she divided the bill between the eight of us, and paying was a quick process."}
{"text":"5 visits and it's always been great! The servers have all been friendly, helpful and cheerful. The food has been great and I've been getting from different parts of the menu each time. The only thing to keep in mind is you may have to wait 20-30 minutes during the busy hours, that's not incoming but keep it in mind (I've overheard others complaining about it while we've been waiting)  We come here almost once a week and we'll continue to do so !"}
{"text":"Salmonella outbreak be damned, I'm eating my runny yolked eggs anyway.   I went to the Cracked Egg around noon on Sunday and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. My plan was not to eat too much because I knew I had to save room to stuff my face at the M buffet later that evening. After reading all the reviews about the big portions, I split the croissant sandwich and seasoned potatoes with my mom. It was definitely a knife and fork sandwich especially because I ordered the eggs over easy. There's a reason why you can't get an over easy egg mcmuffin. It was a delicious, cheesy mess.  I particularly loved the seasoned potatoes, which were super crispy. I can just imagine eating a whole plate of them with gravy! The bf also raved about the hash browns, but I think the seasoned potatoes were better. I also had a bite of my dad's coffee cake which was a bit too sweet for me. It looked like a cornbread square and was less dense than the coffee cakes I'm used to.  Overall, definitely a good place for breakfast or lunch. I mean, even in Vegas you can only eat so many buffets afterall..."}
{"text":"So my husband took me here for a special occasion. It was him, myself, and my 18 month old. I was really excited to try The Cracked Egg as I love trying breakfast places, and I wanted to compare it to some other local places we have been. I wanted to love the experience so much, but I couldn't. I didn't feel that relaxed, comfortable, local feel. As in, the service was below average. I understand places such as here get busy but I worked in the restaurant industry for years so while I can be flexible and understanding I still expect good service. Our server hurried over and asked immediately wanted to order. I asked a couple of questions, we asked recommendations (she did not give us any). I wanted to do a build your own because there were a few extra things I wanted to add to my skillet. She told me just order the corned beef hash skillet off the menu instead of doing build your own (in an annoyed tone) and said it cost less (which it did not, and she said it in an insulting way as if I was trying to jip her or something). I took her recommendation anyways. I love corned beef hash, I order it almost every breakfast place I go but this was not up there compared to some other restaurant's in the areas of quality, taste, and value. I will say the coffee cake was to die for!! I absolutely loved it. The texture, temperature, and flavor was perfect. Our server wasn't seen again the whole meal except to come over and grab our plates (I wasn't done yet) and give us the check. I felt rushed in and out. I just sadly wish our dining experience out on this occasion could have been better. I was disappointed."}
{"text":"It's no wonder this hidden gem was so packed when I got here! The service is great and the food is phenomenal!!! This is going to be one of my favorite places to eat. They have a loyalty program as well. I'm sure it's a seasonal item but you MUST order the pumpkin coffee cake!!! It's so amazing! I about died from the euphoria of just being in the presence of this cake!!! Order it and thank me later!"}
{"text":"Okay  But overpriced to expensive for nothing special just average every day breakfast"}
{"text":"Gluten-free and Las Vegas doesn't go well together.  When you do find a breakfast place that does cater to the gluten-free people in Vegas, you have to visit!  We wanted breakfast, but nothing on the strip is gluten-free friendly.  We searched online and found \"The Cracked Egg.\"  A local breakfast spot that has three locations in Vegas that indeed caters to people eating gluten-free!  We were excited and drove to the south Vegas location.  After going the wrong way off the freeway, we turned around and found \"The Cracked Egg.\"  It is in a nice little outdoor strip mall/  Easy to find once you get going the right way. Upon walking in, we were greeted by the hostess, told them we would like the gluten-free menu and that we wanted to eat outside on their patio.  If you get a chance and it isn't 100 degrees outside yet, take advantage of eating outside on the patio!  The gluten-free menu is two full pages!  Yes...you can order gluten-free pancakes and french toast here!!  After studying the menus, we decided upon an omelet and a scramble. Both were huge portioned and VERY, VERY delicious!  It's places like this that makes me love breakfast food!  The staff here is very friendly and helpful.  They always had a smile on their faces.  Oh...I can't forget...they have those chocolate mints up at the cash register.  The pricing is a few dollars more than I expected, but it's a breakfast spot and it's in Vegas.  While it may not be on the strip, \"The Cracked Egg\" is about only a 5-10 min. drive away.  It well worth the drive to have a breakfast that's delicious and gluten-free!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in on a Saturday morning and let me just say that this place was PACKED. We asked if we could sit at the bar without waiting and they said it was first come first serve so we grabbed two seats. The server was very attentive and made sure our drinks were always filled (huge deal for me). She recommended the coffee cake as one of our sides and it was pretty good. Our main food was alright it wasn't anything special and really over priced but the customer service was off the charts! Would maybe go back and try something different! The pancakes are HUGE a short stack is more than enough!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place is a joke pancakes 15 dollars that's crazy the workers can't even speak English so that's weird trying to give a family business money but not when they r ripping you off cute place YES .. but the food is not good enough for the price"}
{"text":"Today was scheduled to be very busy with little room for disappointments. Cracked Egg representatives did not help prevent my low brow for them today.  It's is for this reason,  that I attribute my dissatisfaction to the led than perfect rating that I've given.   In effort to keeping on schedule, and allowing for preparation for my next stop,  I opted to call in my order. Only to find my calls unanswered on both attempts. The parking lot illustrated  that there should not be many to warrant a busy occurrence such as answered calls. So I found myself walking in to place my order in person. From there, everything  went without a hitch.  Food was made so very timely and there was more than enough staff to accommodate my phone order.   I don't like writing bad reviews so when I do experience less them 5 star service,  I include as much detail as possible. There was nothing wrong with their phones because a test call went  right through while I waited for my food to arrive and my earlier call was mere 40 feet away.   Bottom line, this place still rocks. Just don't rely on saving time by calling in ahead. There may be something that prevents the call from being taken.  :/"}
{"text":"We are visiting from Cali and we came here with a party of 8 on a busy Saturday morning. They said there would be a 20 min wait. But we were seated in 10 mins. Within 5 mins had our drinks and our orders were taken.   I am a omelet conisour so I ordered a \"Wolf\" omelet. It was incredible, oh and instead of toast I ordered the crumb cake. And it was amazing. We all ordered different things and it was all excellent!!   So the bottom line is, the food is awesome, the service is top notch and the prices were very reasonable. In my book, this place is worth 5 STARS!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here this morning for the first time and I absolutely loved my food ... I had the Croissant French toast cover in fresh fruit and a side of Bacon.....  I already know what I'll have next time.... No complaint"}
{"text":"This place would get 5 stars if not for the biggest issue with the cracked egg...PRICES ARE WAY TOO HIGH!! I enjoy the food and it's always busy. The help is nice and courteous. The food is good but not expensive good. The can afford the prices thanks to the upper to high class homes right next door ;)."}
{"text":"Food was alright! I think their coffee cake was awesome. Service was not bad, but I believe I have better breakfast options elsewhere."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. Very good food. Very reasonable. Fast friendly employees. I love there breakfast. A+++"}
{"text":"I went to the Cracked Egg with my son at his suggestion.  I was hoping for a yummy breakfast on a chilly morning.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict with hashbrowns.  The eggs were OK and the hashbrowns were not exactly greasy, but nasty anyway.  The service was good, the country interior was uninteresting and the restaurant very clean.  My son will eat anything and he was less than enthusiastic about his meal as well."}
{"text":"Came here for their gluten free pancakes. Was so happy!!! Best to go during the work week towards closing, otherwise it's super packed."}
{"text":"This place never fails to impress.  The food is consistently delicious and the staff is wonderful.  More impressive, the quality carries from location to location.  I've tried a lot on the menu and yet to be disappointed, even lunch is good.  Mainly I come for breakfast though.  Scrambles, omelets and benny's... oh my!  I think the southwest scramble is my personal favorite.  Spicy and yummy just like me.  If spicy isn't your thing, try the south shore scramble.  Chicken and avocado will set you up for a good day."}
{"text":"The food here is always soo good. The Nutella s'mores stuffed French toast is to die for."}
{"text":"I've dined here before and the food has always been good except for today when I ordered the huevos rancheros. It is the worst huevos I have ever eaten. Service was good just sub par food. I would either improve the dish or take it off the menu.."}
{"text":"My BF and I go out to eat every weekend to a breakfast restaurant. We love the cracked egg!! We've tried several different breakfast restaurants and the cracked egg is our favorite. We frequent this location and love all their dishes. We haven't ordered anything we don't like! Everything come out hot, fresh and very flavorful. The only complaint I would have is the fact that they don't use their AC much. I'm not sure if it's because all the windows they have or not but it's super hot in there, temperature hot! I would rate 5 stars if they would adjust their temperature!"}
{"text":"I ate at this location for the first time today, and I was very happy with the experience.  I ordered \"The Carnitas\" omelette, and to say that it would melt in your mouth would be an understatement.  The seasoned pork in this omelette tasted as if it had been slowly marinated over several days, and then put into this omelette.  The seasoned pork and the other items in this omelette created a blend of flavors that can only be described as outstanding.  The servers were of the type that anticipate your needs, and you hardly have to ask them for anything--first rate!!!  The price was comparable to Ihop and Dennys.  However, the service and the quality/taste of the food was waaaay better than either Ihop or Dennys.  I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Got the breakfast sandwiches for me and the wife.  Soooo good.  Worth the ride to Henderson."}
{"text":"We found Cracked Egg on apple Maps for close breakfast places. With a name like Cracked Egg, we thought this would be a trendy new breakfast place similar to \"Snooze\", \"Over-Easy\", or Cured Ham.\" When we pulled up we realized it was a pretty old place with very little done for design or any upkeep. The inside looks like an out-of-date Denny's... and that is not saying much since all Denny's look out-of-date already. This is the look we would expect from a 1 star Chinese buffet.  We got seated quickly despite being pretty busy and had our waitress take our drink order within a couple of minutes. I love good service. I noticed that all the menu's said all the coffee served was \"100% Guatemalan Coffee\" so we ordered two cups. Nothing about what we drank was exotic nor originating any further south than Mesa. When I asked the waitress the blend of the coffee, she just indicated that it was a cheap house blend and not from Guatemala. After our drinks, the waitress took our order pretty quickly, I ordered Eggs Benedict and my girlfriend ordered Country Fried Steak, both with potatoes, hers with toast.  At first appearance, it looked like the cook was limited to only ingredients what were brown, light brown, or off-white. Nothing appealing about how our dishes looked. A pop of color from fresh herbs or onions or tomatoes  or hell, even garnish would have made this plate look less like an Oliver Twist meal and more like a $20 per person meal.  My Eggs Benedict came with hard boiled yolks (see picture). Immediate turn off. The Country fried steak was dried out and a mess. The menu described the gravy as \"Sausage Gravy\" but we were hard pressed to find any remnants of sausage, nor any flavor of sausage. It tasted like milk and flour with pepper.  Salt... that is what this meal needed to start with. None of my Country Potatoes nor my GF's Breakfast hash had any seasoning. No salt, no pepper, no herbs, no anything really. My breakfast potatoes bored my tastebuds within the first bite. The potato pieces could easily be mistaken for croutons. No party in my mouth from this place with those potatoes.  Overall, the service is great and impressive, the wait staff takes the time to make sure you have everything and the tag team of servers ensured that we got all our food quickly. The food needs help. DESPERATE help. The blandness of all the food may appeal to the elderly regeneration, but for the increasing foodies population, the experience just begs to have more. The visual appearance of the meal is pretty bland, followed by no seasoning, improper egg techniques and overall, BORING appearance. Food should be an experience not just a necessity. This place would have been great during the depression when the act of receiving food was enough, but in this modern age of taste and abundant choices, this place really falls behind.  The menu needs a serious overhaul, the cooks need to not be afraid of using fresh ingredients, herbs, and seasonings, the owner has to want to be relevant within the restaurant industry and the interior needs help... Bad help.  If you are looking for comfort food with no regard of palate, then this is the place, if you think that a $40 breakfast for two should have something redeeming, this is not the place. The only reasons why it didn't get one star, is because the service was decent."}
{"text":"The cracked egg in Henderson- if you're looking for breakfast and you're in town this is the place. Gets busy during prime time but worth a 5 or 10 minute wait to get in. Prices are reasonable to proportion.  Food is always great but what gets me here is the service.  No matter how busy they get or how hard they work the staff is always friendly and going out of their way to make sure you're happy."}
{"text":"Really nice breakfast joint. Get the coffee cake vs toast. Wow. Just wow. I had the Mexican skillet with salsa verde. Chorizo was perfect. Salsa verde was sweet but fit the dish perfect with the picked jalapeños. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"A little on the pricy side. 9.00 for eggs and bacon  I decided to stop by here to try something different.  I got tired of eating the same thing over and over again.  I got seated right away which was awesome since i was on my lunch hour.  Imagine my surprise when I saw the sticker price on the items.  9.00 for eggs and bacon.  The bacon was extra crispy just as i like it but i don't think i can justify spending that much money on just eggs and bacon.  The food was good but the price was just too high."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal here, i kept eating even after I was full. I got the crossait (sp?) sandwhich with the seasoned potatoes... oohh god those potatoes were so freakin good ... i will definetly go back again.... the oj was oddly pricey tho"}
{"text":"I've been coming  with my daughter, family, and friends for a couple of years now and have never been disappointed. There's always a 10-15 minute wait, but the food and customer service are always worth it."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to The Cracked Egg today for a late breakfast - what can I say? We like to sleep in on Sundays.  I probably ordered badly choosing a sandwich at what is undeniably a breakfast joint, I can't recall the name, but it was roast beef, red onion, tomato and lettuce on sourdough sliced bread with \"horseradish mayonaise\" - The sandwich was of undeniable high quality, but I was disappointed that I couldn't detect any distinctive horseradish taste in the mayo - it just tasted like standard Best Foods to me. I quite enjoyed the seasoned potatoes that accompanied my meal.  Wife had a skillet of some sort involving scrambled eggs with cream cheese and scallions, some hash browns and toasted English muffins. She enjoyed the lot, although wasn't so impressed with her hash browns - we both have very exacting standards when it comes to these.  Overall we were prettty happy with our meal there - I would definitely order differently next time. For a ten buck sandwich I received something too close to what I could easily slap together at home, but the menu is reasonably extensive and the place was doing a roaring trade late Sunday morning. We will be back for further exploration."}
{"text":"Love this place! My favorite breakfast/brunch spot. Always good food and good service."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to the cracked egg and I must say, I was not happy with my experience. First of all, the service took way too long. Second,  there was a lot of cross contamination going on. I have went to school for culinary so I know all the requirements working in a kitchen and serving food. My server kept rubbing his nose because it was running. Also, he coughed in his hands and then went to vet the toast out and put it on my plate and served me. Then as I'm eating I found an eye lash in my potatoes. The server was caucasian and had tattoos. Will never go there again thanks to him."}
{"text":"I ordered the corned beef and hash and was extremely disappointed by it. I've eaten here before and the food was great! Very let down this time. Probably will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Very nice servers. The food was very good the first visit. Second visit we had a party of 6, nothing was fresh. Food was coming out in spurts, we had to wait 15 minutes for one dish while they served a dish before that to one of our other guests. They were all over the place. I will give them another chance as they were busy but there isn't any excuse for this type of service."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!   I had one of the breakfast skillets and everything in it was perfect.  Everything I saw looked incredible.  I will definitely come back here a lot more.  It looks like the best place in town to get breakfast.  The lunch menu didn't look too bad either!  The few downsides of it, is I went on a Sunday at 11am and there was about a 30 minute wait for a table.  I don't know why they have such a small location for the business that they do?!   The service is a tad on the slow side, but they do get the orders right, so that's not a big deal.  However, if you are in a hurry, this is not the place for you.  It is in a busy shopping center to begin with, so the parking can be a bit of a challenge.  And it is very loud in there, so it you're looking for a nice quiet brunch place, this also isn't the place for you.   But if you don't mind these issues, the food is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Very friendly, every dish was great, quick and hot! We had no problems substituting or adding to out plates and the coffee cake was soooo good!!"}
{"text":"There is no better place to go for a great, easy breakfast in Vegas for the price.  They have such a wide selection of egg dishes for breakfast, delicious stuffed french toast, a wide range of lunch selections... total food boner.  The eggs are always done perfectly, the toast is crisp but not burnt, the service is excellent... it's an awesome modern diner.  Also, Cracked Egg is giving Poppy's Frozen Yogurt a run for its money with the jailbait cashiers."}
{"text":"We came here the morning after a wedding with a large group of 12. Cory our waitress was so sweet and made sure our meal was perfect. The food was delicious and we will return to see her soon."}
{"text":"For ever now we have been looking for a a good Ruben in town I HAVE FOUND IT   It was good food, great fries and great service."}
{"text":"I came in a with a Groupon to give this place a try  Wasn't expecting much...  so I was blown away with great service, good biscuts and gravy, and the best Monte Cristo I've had in decades   I'll be back as soon as I can work off the calories"}
{"text":"The food was great and I'd recommend the hash browns for sure. The reason it's not 5 stars the waitress wasn't attentive enough but still great place overall"}
{"text":"What is up with the hard poached eggs????  I'm going to try to request it runny next time. A weird to thing to request for Eggs Benedict.. The first time I thought it was an oversight. The second time made me believe it's a regular thing, which it probably might be, according to the other reviews. Cmon, when the word 'egg' is in your title AND you're a breakfast place...  It's a shame because the chorizo eggs Benedict was very flavorful.   Service is generally very good and the area is clean despite the hustle and bustle."}
{"text":"I've been to the 215/Rainbow or 215/Green Valley locations 20+ times.  As you can tell, my family and I love this place.  Great food, I love the chicken fried steak and hash browns.  Some family members love the coffee cake and others love the Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"Great omelets and absolutely the best coffee cake I have ever had. Ask them to split an omelet and you will still have plenty of food and room for the delicious coffee cake. Very friendly and efficient staff as well. Nice to have a good local breakfast place. This is what Original Pancake house used to be."}
{"text":"This place is so good. The skillets are by far the best I've ever had. They make a new batch of coffee cake when they run out and it's always a different flavor. I wish I had known that before I came because I ended up with strawberry peanut butter and it was definitely very different. It wasn't bad but it wasn't what I was expecting. This little place is about 5 minutes from the strip and it was packed when I came on a Monday morning"}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast spots to go to. We go to this location the most. Gets crowded at times but it's pretty spacious compared to other cafes. They have plenty of seating inside and outside. Depending on the time you go , we usually go on Sunday's , a little later in the am and have never had to wait no more longer than 10-15 minutes for a table. For as early as they have to be up, staff is always friendly and welcoming. We've had Andi and Steve several times as our server and do an excellent job but from what I remember all servers are awesome. They are very attentive and genuine. My favorite dish is the cordon bleu skillet. If you're like me and love to eat sometimes thats just not enough. I get the banana chocolate chip pancakes as well and can get just one or a two stack instead the 3 but you have to request for it I believe. Just check the menu. They are really great about meeting your requests on substitutions too! Highly recommended to try."}
{"text":"Hey it's a great breakfast place! The coffee cake is such a nice treat , great menu to please anyone breakfast and lunch ,salads etc...  service is hit amd miss but it won't keep me away.  it gets busy so go early!"}
{"text":"Super quick service.  My coffee cup was continually full.  The food tasted good (pancakes were fluffy, chicken well seasoned and scrambled egg whites cooked perfectly) and it was definitely a fair price."}
{"text":"At last: edible breakfast in Las Vegas.  Husband and I have tried so many breakfast spots in Vegas that it's not even funny, and they have ranged from \"meh\" to \"OMG no.\" This is the first time we've really enjoyed the breakfast foods we ordered.  I am aware some of you will immediately reject this review because you think Vegas breakfasts taste just like breakfast anywhere else. I love you, but this review is not for you.  For those of who you KNOW that tasty breakfast isn't really Vegas' *thing*, come HERE. This place is good.  The pancakes, etc. were NOT tasteless. The fruit was actually ripe. The Hollandaise was delicious and generously given. The coffee was actually good!  Literally the only thing that might be annoying is the condescending signage. (They actually have the \"There is no Wi-Fi. Talk to each other. Pretend it's 1995.\" To which I say: https://mostlysignssomeportents.tumblr.com/post/92606477500/dunebat-coldswarkids-edwardspoonhands  )  It is with a SPIRIT OF TRUE IRONY that I leave this review for them online, which is where we FOUND this place, and which would not have been possible in 1995. Ha!"}
{"text":"Easy to find and easy parking.  Good prices.  The coffee was just ok.  I got the joes scramble and it was good but not great.   Service was very good"}
{"text":"Amazing place for breakfast! Staff is excellent,  on top of everything and quick worth every request. Food is fresh and tastes great. Reading some of the other reviews and we think its hilarious someone would complain theres no TV monitors, if your looking for that type of atmosphere don't come here. Come here for great conversation with your friends or family. Put down the phone and get off Facebook cause there's no wifi. Enjoy your food! You'll be happy you did. This was our first visit and we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in henderson. I've been coming here for at least 10 years. The food and service is always good. Wish they had better coffee and that they dropped the check soon after your meal was served. Most of the time I have to ask for it. Come early on weekends or expect to wait as this restaurant gets very busy."}
{"text":"This place gets two stars because the service was good. Our waitress was accommodating. But the food wasn't that great. The food feels like something frozen and got microwaved."}
{"text":"The coffee cake!!  My only issue was on Memorial Day/Veterans day they would only give military discount if in uniform... Most of us don't go around in uniform to eat!  Overall it was a good experience and the service was quick"}
{"text":"We are working in the area and saw the 3.99 brakefast sign. So decided to have some brunch there few days ago .food is good .our server was a little bit confused but she end up doing good job. Recommended."}
{"text":"Food was great and came out super fast. The entire staff was friendly. I will come back"}
{"text":"Their food here is so flavorful, I always enjoy everything I order and so does my boyfriend. Only reason they don't get 5 stars is because the service always kinda sucks. Servers always seem irritated, I'm sure they know how busy it's going to be on a weekend by now."}
{"text":"Waitress was very nice, and they refill your coffee frequently. Plenty of seating too. I wasn't very impressed with the food. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. The pancakes were good. Very typical diner food and feel. I'd recommend it if you're looking for an old-fashioned American breakfast."}
{"text":"this has always been my go to breakfast spot. one of the only places in vegas with gluten free blueberry pancakes! the service is always friendly and their coffee is super good. great for take out as well."}
{"text":"Finally! A place with gluten free blueberry pancakes. my 2nd all time favorite food :) I've been here like 5 times in the past two weeks and its so good. The side of fruit is amazing too. grapefruit slices, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, and sliced melon!  Fresh squeezed orange juice is the cherry on top to an amazing meal. The staff is very friendly and accommodating as well. My new favorite breakfast spot :)"}
{"text":"Some of the worst service ever ! We have a large family so we understand that waiting for table is almost always a must. We arrive to we're told 20 minutes . We waited over an hour and when we finally heard out name and hostess (a guy) was rude and less then welcoming . The first attempt was to sit my large family of 7 at a table that fits 4! Seriously??? In the mean time try sit a party of 2 in a corner booth that would fit our family. We finally get a table that still only seat 4 comfortable only to get our drinks messed up. The coffee cake was cold and it took 10 minutes to get an extra plate!   I'm disappointed in this location !! Never again"}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg. I looked up nearby breakfast places and came across this one. For some reason I felt like eating eggs and how appropriate.  Walked in and was seated pretty quickly. Sat down and was immediately greeted by our server. She quickly let us order our coffee and we browsed the menu. I ordered the Cakes & Eggs Combo while the husband ordered the Huervos Rancheros. Waited for a little bit as the entire restaurant was pretty busy. I like basic breakfast. Nothing heavy or I would have to roll out of the restaurant. Cakes, eggs, and bacon were good. My husband didn't speak for a straight 15 minutes while he was wolfing down his breakfast. We were FULL.  Overall pretty good food and decent prices. Our server was pretty helpful and she didn't stress us to leave even though it was super busy. Nice place to grab breakfast."}
{"text":"Management soured my experience.  Typically I love this place, but usually eat at Egg Works (my friend prefers it)  However, I had purchased a Groupon to The Cracked Egg so I needed to use it.  The catch. I accidentally purchased a groupon that I could only use Mon-Fri.  Since I am always at work M-F, It ended up expiring.  If anyone knows anything about Groupon it states right on the page that the value you used to purchase the groupon never expires.  So I figured taking it in on a Sunday, at least I would be able to use the original amount towards my meal.  The server curtly told me that they would not accept it.  When I asked to see a manager, she came over with an attitude and refused to acknowledge my explanation or even listen to anything I wanted to say.  She kept repeating we will not take it.  I felt that she was incredibly rude and will unfortunately not return to this location because of her.  It is really unfortunate for me, because the food was absolutely delicious.  Probably one of the better breakfasts I've eaten.  But I refuse to go to a restaurant where the management will not even listen to what I have to say.  I also feel that it would not have effected the store if she would have honored the original groupon price.  Thank goodness for me I can still go to Egg Works.  They have always treated me with respect and smiles."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place, really nothing special, but not horrible either.  Wife's tropical french toast was dry and overly sweet. The place was full of diner's so they do have a following. The coffee is strong and good. Sugar dispenser and more creamers would be nice. We will have to try again sometime, but probaly not likely."}
{"text":"Since I moved to Vegas 3 years ago This place has always had great service and food. They are quick, efficient and very friendly. I recommend this place to everybody!"}
{"text":"This place is clearly popular since the wait to get in is usually 20 minutes. The problem is their inability to keep track of who is waiting and for how long. I took two friends here today, was told a 20 minute wait. After 35 minutes, I asked the girl at the desk who said \"there's just two people in front of you.\" I sat on a bench in front of this person for the next 20 minutes as they sat group after group. After seeing at least 5 groups get seated, I asked again, only to be met with confused looks and NO apology. I could see the panic as the front end staff tried to figure out what they could do, which should have been seat us immediately. That didn't happen so we left. I won't be going back to this place ever again."}
{"text":"Laid back basic breakfast place. Inside it reminds me of a breakfast place in So. Cal. I like the feel of it. Have had a variety of dishes. After trying different meals, I usually stick with one of the basic eggs + dishes. Hot links and Eggs are my fave right now. Spicy! Not too too spicy though.   Was not impressed with the coffee cake. Was expecting something denser, with a crumble but this was like Angel food cake with strawberry jam and a drizzle of icing. Not my thing. Coffee was pretty good, they could have kept it coming but were quite busy.  All in all, they deliver just what I expect of a breakfast place, though I would prefer to be happily surprised."}
{"text":"By far my favorite breakfast place! The service was great and food is delicious! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"i love the whole wheat pancakes...they have a delicious cinnamon flavor to them.  they're best with bananas baked in!  i also love that you can order just one if you want; and that you can get a side of straight berries.    there's usually a wait, which is the only bummer, but it's worth it.  and once you sit down, they don't rush you, which is nice."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!!!!! If you give this place anything less then 4 stars then you need your head checked. Unless there was a bug or hair or some other foreign object in your food, or the service was completely rude or terrible, then you've got NOTHING to complain about. Banana walnut pancakes are incredible."}
{"text":"On vacation & looking for something other than a buffet.  Found this place on yelp & it didn't disappoint.  We walked right in with no wait to sit.  We ordered kids chocolate chip pancakes with a side of bacon (3 slices) and scrambled eggs w/cheddar cheese & bacon with (not so) season potatoes & coffee cake.  The coffee cake came out warmed right away.  This is not your average coffee cake.  Its light and fluffy similar to an angel cake with strawberry & apple inside.  Apparently the flavor changes day to day - surprise.  We played 4 games of tic tac toe & the food arrived - that was quick.  The eggs were cooked perfectly.  The potato were very bland.  My son gobbled up his pancakes but was full about 1 1/2 cakes through.  He said he was glad we chose this place - score.  Also the waitress was great.  Prices are about average.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Bestest breakfast spot in Vegas! Their coffee cake is amazing and the service is always great"}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg is traditional breakfast food, but nothing special in my opinion. Yeah it's a smaller location compared to IHOP and Cracker Barrel and whatnot, but it's still decent food. Nothing special or something to remember, but I did enjoy. If I'm in the area I'll be sure to stop by again, but again it wasn't over the top!"}
{"text":"Some of the best breakfast in town! The hostesses are young and ditzy sometimes, but the waitress we usually get is always super nice and attentive. The coffee cake NEVER fails and is always delish, no matter what flavor! I highly suggest the Taylor's scramble, build your own skillets, and the oatmeal. It's not your average oatmeal. Comes with half and half, raisins, granola, fresh berries, brown sugar, etc. It is the best oatmeal I have ever eaten and the ingredients and so fresh. If you join their breakfast club, they send you coupons in the mail all the time too. There really isn't a bad thing to say about this place, except that if you get there between 9-10am, you are going to wait a while for a seat! My boyfriend and I visit at least twice a month!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and decided to check this breakfast spot out. We were not disappointed! We are pancake lovers and the cakes here are delicious!! We tried out the chocolate chip pancakes and the blueberry pancakes both were super fluffy and packed full of chocolate chips and blueberries. The coffee here is also great! Service is outstanding, I was never left with an empty cup of coffee! We will be back next time we're in town! Thanks for a great breakfast!!"}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg is a solid breakfast restaurant that also serves lunch items as well. My husband and I don't go here often as we prefer other breakfast places around town.   Let's start with the service - I've never gone into The Cracked Egg and had a negative experience. The staff is always friendly and polite. Also, they're very attentive and your drink cup is seldom empty. Sometimes there is a bit if a wait to get seated, especially on weekends.   Now let's get into the grub - Their food is good. I wouldn't call it delicious, but it's pretty tasty. I ordered the Benedict Ole for $11.40. This breakfast includes two eggs benedict, but instead of ham, it comes with chicken and green chiles. I got to choose between shredded hashbrowns or seasoned potatoes; I chose the hashbrowns. As I said, the meal was pretty good, but the flavors were nothing that left me wanting more. The hashbrowns were also pretty standard.   Overall, The Cracked Egg is a solid breakfast joint, but if you want to give other places around town a chance, I think you can find better. Also, their prices aren't really competitive when compared to other eateries. For two egg benedicts with hashbrowns, I paid almost $12.00. You can get more bang for your buck elsewhere."}
{"text":"Excellent service-the waitress was exceptionally sweet and pleasant. Food came out fast and fresh. The coffee cake with cherries is so yummy! We both had terrific egg dishes-it would seem weird to come to an egg place and try a sandwich however, after we try more breakfast dishes we hope to try some lunch dishes as well! Please put a restaurant in North Vegas!!! We can't wait to run into Nicholas Cage here as we read he is a fan!"}
{"text":"This review is kind a tale of two aspects of the restaurant.  Let's start with the positive - the food (which is what you come here for in the first place).  And it was awesome.  Our group had the breakfast croissant sandwich (with scrambled eggs and ham), the eggs benedict and a short stack of pancakes. Everything was great.  The sandwich had perfectly prepared eggs with melty cheese and flavorful ham.  The croissant was huge and delicious.  Just the right amount of flakiness. The short stack of pancakes were perfectly done and delicious.  As for the benedict, it was awesome.  The hollandaise sauce was excellent, the eggs were perfect.  Just delicious.  With the exception of the short stack, the dishes came with excellent seasoned potatoes.  Easily five-star food and one of the top two breakfast meals we've had since moving here last year.   Now the negative - the service.  Our waitress was really clueless, while drinks were served promptly, after our order was taken the waitress disappeared for like 10 minutes and then came back to tell us she forgot to put the order in.  We got a half-hearted apology, but clearly it amused her too because she giggled throughout.  So she walks over to the machine and starts typing in the order, then has to flee back because she can't read what she wrote down for one of the order.  Our food did come out fairly quickly after that, but she dropped the plates off in a hurry and wandered off before I could even tell her that we had no silver ware. So we had to wait for her to wander back to get that.  I realize that everyone has bad days and mistakes happen, but the sheer volume of screw ups here was unacceptable.  One-star (at best) for the service.    Given that great food and abominable service, I'm going to split the difference and give Cracked Egg 3 stars.  I'm sure we will be back at some point, because the food was great, but the service was certainly concerning."}
{"text":"It was fair.  Waitress was sort of rude.   Got a Mexican skillet.   Nothing too exciting.  Egg should have been inside not sitting on top cheese.  Egg and I is much better.   Asked for tea but waitress couldn't tell me the types.     Last year went and they had red velvet.  It was awesome.   Today they had an apple one.  Blah."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to breakfast places in the valley. Unfortunately there is almost always going to be a semi long wait to be seated. The foods always good and the customer service is great. The coffee cake is amazing and makes the wait worth it."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was delish! I had the croissant egg sandwich with hash browns, coffee and orange juice. I would go here again for sure."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast after dropping my little dude off to preschool. Not crowded at all so I took a seat at the counter. The menu was quite extensive and I REALLY REALLY wanted the Peanut Butter French Toast with honey and bananas....however...I had a hot yoga class at 10 am and didn't want to puke in the middle of it. I opted for an egg white omelet, seasoned potatoes and sourdough toast. Also I decided to throw in a coffee and fresh squeezed grapefruit juice (no joke...it was fresh squeezed). It was delightful. Perfectly cooked, seasoned and yummy. Will be back there many times when I have to take the kids to school."}
{"text":"I'm very impressed. I've owned my owned a restaurant before, and I appreciate excellent service. These folks provide friendly (always with a smile) and lightning fast service, along with.perfectly prepared food every time. A pleasant experience every visit. HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"I am a fan.  The fruit was tasty and sweet. The eggs were fluffy and light. The service was way above average, loved our server. Prices are fair, around the $10 range for most Breakfasts on the menu, give or take a few bucks. This location is over in \"the linn \"... the yuppie watching was excellent, see them uptight even as they try to relax, catch snippets of conversation that will linger long after breakfast is done :D Most definitely, will be back for more tasty dishes to be served up."}
{"text":"I had the Green Scramble with egg whites, no cheese, and chocolate chip coffee cake ($11.00). I also had two banana chocolate chip pancakes with sugar free syrup.  The scramble was good. The seasoned potatoes are nothing special, just heavily seasoned fried potatoes, basically french fries in a different shape.   The coffee cake was great.  Though I'm not sure I've ever had bad coffee cake.  When will sugary bread not taste good?  Downside is you have to have whatever kind of coffee cake they have for the day, but that can also be a good thing because it takes out having to rack your brain to decide.  Would love to try their other flavors.  The banana chocolate chip pancakes were excellent! They were made just right. And I had sugar free syrup.  I also used a 2 for 1 coupon. Without it, it's a tad pricey, but so is every other good breakfast place I suppose."}
{"text":"This remains the best breakfast place I have ever dined at. They proudly display their many restaurant awards around the restaurant-- awards which are well earned. The atmosphere is pleasant and comfortable-- the decorations aren't overly fancy but the interior is fairly well maintained.  Service tends to be pretty good here--even when it gets busy. The girls at the front can get pretty swamped during the Sunday rush but they always get the bill worked out right in the end. The waiters are pretty friendly and they know their menu pretty well. Subsitutions can be usually be made without much fuss. The coffee is pretty good, and the coffee cake is heavenly ( you need to try it at least once.)  The seasoned potatoes do definitely stand out here-- they are easily the best I've ever tasted. They aren't overly seasoned, arent too greasiy, and they have a satisfying crunchiness to them. Portions here are pretty hefty--maybe not Hash-House-A-Go-Go big, but respectable. Bring a decent appetite to make your trip here worthwhile.  I've tried a number of their dishes, from their fluffy and satisfying pancakes to their wide variety of egg dishes. Waffles are heavenly here--much better than you would find at IHOP or other large corporate spots. There aren't too many skillet options but I suggest you try  the vegetable egg skillet with chicken. The signature egg dishes go well with a side of cholula sauce but most are so well seasoned that you may not find you need it. The omelettes are fluffy and cooked just right. They never skimp on avocadoes or meat here. The wheat toast always arrives lathered in real butter. I recently enjoyed their unique pesto scramble. The french toast is rich and flavorful. This place simply does breakfast right and has earned its keep as one of the elite breakfast destinations in Clark County."}
{"text":"The one in Henderson was my favorite breakfast spot! This is my first time at this location. I ordered the chicken fried steak with eggs. The refs were delicious and he seasoned potatoes are my favorite food item they make!  The chicken fried steak was also delicious but my minor complaint is there isn't enough gravy! I'll order an extra side of it next time.  Come here, get the seasoned potatoes.  The service was fast and decent as well.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Disappointing at best! Overall, my breakfast had little flavor (SW Scramble). I love jalapenos, but this dish is way too overloaded and it didn't appear to add flavor. The chorizo was sour and my guess is there was 1 egg and about 4 cups of cheese. Potatoes appear to be out of a bag from the freezer and in turn were extremely dry. I even tried drenching them with salsa. Still not good. After a few bites I pushed my plate away. Waitress came by and asked how everything was. I said \"terrible\". Her response (obviously wasn't really listening)....ok great, enjoy! I had to ask for coffee refills each time. And keep in mind that we were sitting at the bar. When we left, the cashier asked how our meals were. My boyfriend told him....mine was just OK but my girlfriend was only able eat a few bites of hers. His response....glad to hear it. Disappointing meal and clueless staff. We definitely won't be back. Lots of other options in Vegas."}
{"text":"Always busy, but always worth the wait. If you want to sit right away, try and snag a stool at the counter.  Coffee cake is always amazing, and I have yet to order an item that wasn't amazingly delicious. The pesto scramble though, WOW!  The service is always great and the staff does a gear job balancing their time with all the different customers.  If you don't like eating in a crowded restaurant or enjoy solo dining, this is maybe not the place for you. Lots of families, but because of the crowded atmosphere, they have nowhere to run or cause a scene aside from the table they're sitting at. (I'm clearly not a parent).  Please check this place out!!"}
{"text":"I am a repeat customer. Although there have been minor issues on previous visits, I can honestly say that I had the best breakfast that I have ever had at the Cracked Egg, today. Today, they got everything right. My eggs were over medium, as ordered. My bacon was soft and my hash browns crunchy, again, as ordered. White toast was perfect and the coffee cup was kept full. The service was terrific as well. Thanks Cracked Egg. Good job."}
{"text":"Stick to ordering the basic breakfast items, and arrive at the butt crack of dawn if you don't want to wait. Those would be my suggestions.  As much as I enjoy devouring their simple, yet tasty bowl of oatmeal, I would probably have to stick with that option if I were to return to The Cracked Egg. On my last visit, I tried the GVP omelette, which is served with a choice of potatoes or hash browns, and a choice of toast or coffee cake. The coffee cake arrived piping hot, which seemed like it came right out from the microwave. I couldn't stomach the omelette. Maybe it was the mushrooms and spinach combo, or just too much of the stringy Munster cheese, but it just didn't taste good.   So long, Cracked Egg. From now on, I'll be heading up the road to IHOP."}
{"text":"Fan of this location when I am in Henderson area on business. Always friendly prompt service and the prices are fair. Typically a short wait between 830AM and Noon or so, its always goes fast. Like options for both breakfast or lunch .  I think the scrambles are really good. Had a new one recently, could not decide between breakfast or lunch, so I had the cheeseburger scramble.  Eggs, potatoes and a cheeseburger all in one."}
{"text":"Great place I had great service both times I had  better service the first time I was there although last time I came close to closing. Food great both times gyro skillet fabulous and Irish eggs Benedict was  also fabulous. Free ice cream with your meal served after 11 am which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"The experience was off from the start. To begin with we asked for a high chair which the waiter gracefully went off to get. 5 minutes of waiting with an empty restaurant surronding us I asked again and she finally went to actually get it. I wasn't upset though busy minds are okay but then I asked for an Iced Coffee and never got it and couldn't remind the server again because once she dropped off our food she left to never return. I wad still perfectly okay with everything didnt mind the poor service but then once our check was given to this time around she seemed frustated and upset which threw me off? I wondered why she was so upset towards us but I ignored it once more. After I handed my card to her I asked for a box and oh boy did she not deliver once again. Then my husband turns to me and says \"wait did anyone get a coffee?\" I asked for one of course but throughout the whole mean never received it so why ask? Well he said I think there was a coffee on the receipt. Which I hoped their wasnt but oh and behold there it was! She not only gave me vad service and lacked at everything but she charged me for something I didnt even receive so now here I am done and frustrated at a waited we had done nothing to asking for a refund for the coffee I didnt even get. She angrily gave me back 3 dollars bills and was silent to us until we left. The food was decent but not worth the awful service."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre. There's nothing unique about it. I ordered a croissant french toast and it was stale. The side of eggs were horrible. Customer service was okay. Overall, jst one time try."}
{"text":"2 locations, amazing breakfast choices, what more could you ask for? Oh wait, and they offer lunch options too? Whenever I have friends in town or I can't get a girl to leave the morning after I make sure to take them to the Cracked Egg. I think the employees may be on to me based on the disheveled appearances of my guests during breakfast.  Right, I forgot there's actually food here too. The banana walnut pancakes are basically the nuts and their fresh fruit plate is ACTUALLY fresh fruit unlike most breakfast places. I approve of everything the Cracked Egg does including their reasonable prices and friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"My love affair with The Cracked Egg started at this location and migrated to the Cheyenne location when I bought a home in Summerlin.  I'm still partial to this location mainly because it is more spacious and has a really light, fun ambiance to it. Their food is always fresh and interesting and I've never had a bad meal here. I tried the Vaquero omelet which had green chilis, chorizo, salsa, and lots of cheese, sour cream, and salsa smothered on top. This was one heavy, flavorful dish but the eggs were still fluffy and made me want to nom nom nom all day. The sourdough toast was also really interesting and I'd definitely get that again, that's for sure! If you are looking for something lighter you need to try the banana walnut pancakes because they are heavenly.  If you are in search of a solid, inexpensive breakfast with a fun atmosphere and friendly waitstaff then eat at The Cracked Egg and thank me later."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast joint with best sausage links I've found!  Coffee cake of the day, good java nice folks.  Did I say sausage link is great!"}
{"text":"Good portions with good flavor.  My family lives nearby and when I visit, we like to come here.  The coffee cake is interesting with the apples baked into the bottom.  I usually get a scramble and the sides of salsa that come with it are good!  There are plenty of options for everyone regardless of what you're in the mood for.  The pesto scramble had a good pine nut flavor and the green scramble is just as tasty!"}
{"text":"What a place and what a price!  Just great service, food and atmosphere!  People were very friendly and food was just fabulous! Will visit again when we are in town!"}
{"text":"So delicious!!!!! If you come here better try their seasoned fries they are the best. I had the garden omelette with broccoli, spinach, tomatoes and cheese so good! My husband had philly chicken sandwich so good too!! I really recommend this place! Oh and one other thing out bill was like 20 bucks!!"}
{"text":"The breakfast here is so good! We have our favorites like the big bad wolf and the pesto scramble but, make out a point to try new things too! The coffee cake is to die for and is always freshly made. The staff is so friendly, giving it a down home flavor. Definitely one of our favorite breast places!"}
{"text":"Breakfast, breakfast, and more breakfast! If you want breakfast, and want it done well, go to The Cracked Egg!  THE FOOD: With my usual craving to devour everything on the menu, it's always a challenge to decide on what to order, especially at breakfast because it's my favorite meal of the day. I ended up ordering the Cakes & Eggs Combo so I could get a little bit of everything. The eggs were cooked to perfection, and the sausage patties were flavorful. DON'T get the sausage links, the waiters/waitresses even recommend against it, hahaha. The pancakes were really good too! The right amount of fluffiness drenched in an ocean of syrup (I did that myself, of course).   The Cracked Egg also serves coffee cake, and it's apparently somewhat popular. I had the opportunity to eat some of this coffee cake, and it was...chocolate...coffee cake? I really don't know how to explain it any better than that. It was okay, it just tasted like a dry chocolate cake with coffee cake crumble on top. Other people have told me they have had other types of coffee cake, so I'm guessing The Cracked Egg likes to change things up. If you're curious, I would ask the staff.  The staff is another topic. I didn't think they were very friendly. The woman who seated us (my mom, my stepdad, and I) practically threw our menus and utensils on the table without saying a word, and returned to the front of the restaurant. Our waitress was also very quick in wanting to get us to leave when the restaurant wasn't even half full.  THE VERDICT: Overall, the food is fantastic. The staff, not so much. I'll go back for the food, especially since I love a place that does breakfast well."}
{"text":"My wife placed an order for pickup today and the lady who answered the phone became very rude and dismissive when asked about an item which is somewhat vague in its description on the menu. Everyone has a bad day, I get it but as a first time customer giving you our business it's very distasteful and disappointing."}
{"text":"My wife has been here several times but this is my first. She was craving the Monte Cristo. I love a good Eggs Benedict. After other reviews, I got mine with the sliced avocado on the side. That just put it over the top. Very good seasoned potatoes. See my picture to see what I thought of it.  My wife loved her Monte Cristo. I don't think it's anything special. It wasn't greasy at all, which it is at some places. A little on the small size if you ask me. Served with maple syrup instead of the traditional fruit compote or jam.   A great breakfast spot for sure."}
{"text":"This place is the reason why I finally opened a Yelp account...  I wanted to take my boyfriend to breakfast for his birthday so I looked up some places since we are from out of town, and I decided to come here. The menu had a bunch of delicious options from peanut butter French toast to croissant egg sandwich. The variety of egg Benedicts caught my eye so I decided on the Veggie one with avocado, spinach and grilled tomatoes and my boyfriend chose the Pastrami Benedict and an order of chocolate chip pancakes.  My order was a beautiful display and tasted even better than it looked. I enjoyed every single bite! My boyfriend loved his dish as well and we could barely get into the pancakes since we were quite full with our benedict plates. Price was reasonable for the amount of food and service was great, very friendly waitress and bright, welcoming, cute decorative setting.  After leaving I believe I said out loud \"that was the best breakfast I've had in a long time\" about 5 times! I will definitely be back the next time we are in Vegas and recommend it to many others.  Thank you for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice. Having had a hard time finding a decent breaky in the area, was happy to find. Typical breakfast place with extremely friendly and attentive service.   Both times got the eggs benedict with spinach added. Was perfect for what I was looking for. I'll return."}
{"text":"This place is so gooood! Huge selection so whatever ur craving - they have it! The coffee cake is sooooo moist & so tasty, it's addicting ..Beware! Service was great, time from order till when food arrived was a little lengthy but well worth it :)"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was friendly without being overbearing and ended up chatting with the other people at the counter. Exactly what a great diner is. Breakfast is my favorite meal and these guys got it right."}
{"text":"Ordered here while on a vacay in Vegas while staying at a nearby airbnb. Good solid breakfast food at reasonable price. Good variety of omelettes gluten free, high protein, vegetarian - something for everybody! , Love that most breakfast items cane with a choice of coffee cake which we all ate as breakfast the next day."}
{"text":"A great place for Breakfast.  My wife and I...tired of the expensive Las Vegas Strip foods...and the cheap buffet's off strip buffet's, decided to give \"The Cracked Egg\" a try.  We were not disappointed!  The menu is extensive...and most dishes are priced an average of $11.  We are skillet crazed and the Egg delivered! I had the \"Bacon-Cheeseburger Skillet\" and my wife had a build your own skillet with sausage, tomato's, onions and cheese.  Cheeseburger for breakfast you say?  It was just chock full of ground beef, plenty of cheese, home style potatoes and fresh bacon galore.  I added a side of hollandaise to top my perfectly cooked eggs over easy and voila...taste perfection.  No skimping here.  The place was typical strip mall diner style seating...the staff friendly and helpful...all in all a great place to catch a great hearty breakfast!    Hungry for lunch...check the backside of the menu for sandwiches, burgers etc.  But the breakfast is the draw..I mean...it is called \"The Cracked Egg\" afterall."}
{"text":"This place sucks the service is horrible and so was the food......the managers on duty didn't  care if we had a good experience..... Never again I give them a negative 5 stars"}
{"text":"I ordered the Classic French Toast and the Cakes and Egg combo. I really enjoyed the French Toast, Eggs, Turkey Sausage but NOT the Pancakes so much. I like the cozy, pretty quiet tucked away brunch spot. Overall it was a good inexpensive, decent food great service type of place.   I'll Be Back (in my Terminator voice)!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Breakfast!!! I had the Western Scramble.  We also had the Eggs Benedict and Huevos Rancheros - All was GREAT!!!  The warm Coffee Cake is to Die for - A must try !!!!"}
{"text":"I like coconuts. I like french toast. I like fruit. So, the tropical french toast was an obvious pick. Loved it. The portions were huge and enough for two people. Other stuff i've tried on previous visits include:  - croissant french toast: not my favorite, the french toast croissant was too mushy  - raspberry stuffed french toast: delicious  - chocolate chip pancakes: good, but nothing spectacular  - philly cheesesteak: surprisingly good, a little on the small side, chicken was very tender, plenty of onions and peppers, bread was nice and chewy and fresh  The service tends to be on the slow side no matter the day or time. The last time I went was a Monday morning and there were maybe 2 other groups in whole place. It still took a while to get my order in. Didn't see my waitress again until we flagged her down to get the check. But, you're not paying for the service or ambiance. Just good breakfast and lunch food."}
{"text":"Good customer service is as crucial as good food. Although the food was quite delicious, the bad service we experienced left a horrible taste in my mouth.  My husband and I went for Sunday brunch and the hostess told us the wait would be about 20 minutes. The wait area inside was full so we waited outside with about 15 other people. We figured with this many people waiting that this place had to be good. About 25 minutes later, my husband checked with the hostess and she said she called his name about 20 minutes ago. Funny thing was that while my husband was inside talking to the hostess, a party of 5 next to me complained that they were never called and the hostess insisted she called them. They were more bothered (as was I) that the hostess insisted she called their name and didn't apologize for the inconvenience. A group of 4 who just paid walked out and were complaining about the rudeness of the hostess! Three groups complaining about the bitchiness of the hostess is not a coincidence!  When we were finally seated, the hostess dropped our menu and our silverware on the table, didn't say a word and walked away. WOW. We waited a while for our waitress and she also had a sour attitude! I even asked my husband if I was just imagining things but agreed that she was not pleasant at all.  As I was making mental notes about what I should rant in my Yelp review, the coffee cake came out and managed to bring what was supposed to be a 2 star review to a 2.5/3. It was moist and heavenly!  My husband ordered the Chicken Fried Steak and it was decent but not the best we've ever had. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and I loved the hollandaise and the thickness of the ham. The seasoned potatoes were the perfect complement to the eggs.  Note to the management of The Cracked Egg: Bad attitude can really ruin a customer's service. On busy weekends, please ensure your hostesses and wait staff are smiling and friendly.  I would suggest to invest in pagers because it can be difficult to hear the hostesses when there are 15 people waiting outside and planes flying overhead. With Egg Works opening up down the street in Fall 2011, I doubt I'd come back here because of bad attitude I encountered even though the food was good."}
{"text":"This place is great! I always enjoy my visit here because of the great service and skillet's. You can make your own skillet or get whats on the menu, great to have a choice. I tried their Country Benny for fathers day and it was great!"}
{"text":"This was ok, the coffee cake was great, but we didn't get our drinks refilled even once.  I wouldn't avoid this place but I wouldnt go out of my way to go there regardless of how hungry I am.   Croissant french toast, wasn't that great, it kind of tasted like only the heels of a standard loaf of bread."}
{"text":"My girlfriend found this place and it was great.  I had an omelette that was perfectly done and the coffee is perfect."}
{"text":"This little gem was a delight.   The food and the portions were great.  Also, Bambi she was very personable and attentive.  Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"One word...UNDER-SEASONED!  We ordered the following on a Tuesday at 10:15 AM: 1.) Californian Omelet-has bacon, avocados and cheese.  Under-seasoned. 2.) Homemade Corned Beef Hash-Had to add salt.  I asked for a side of rice, but sadly, they don't make rice there.  C'mon, I am Asian.  I love rice with Corned Beef.  But that is not the reason why I gave them only 3 stars.  I asked the waitress to have my egg scrambled over easy, it came out non-scrambled, over easy. Under-seasoned.  We chose the seasoned potatoes, the hash brown, and the coffee cake to go with our food.  The coffee cake was warm and moist, with cherries at the bottom.  Tasted delicious with the coffee.  For the hash brown, I asked for it extra crispy, but didn't come out to how I would like it to be.    If I come back, I will probably just order the coffee cake and a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Had the California burger and hubby had the classic cheeseburger.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Me and my family of six have been going to this place every weekend since we live next door.  Lately however, the food has been getting worse and worse and the last two times they got our order wrong.  Today we got a really rude waitress she brought the wrong order to my son again, never apologized, never came back for refills and when we complained about the bad service,  and asked if we can use a two for one coupon on a check for six people ($80) they told us NO.  Needless to say, we are never coming back again.   Yelp customers would be wise to stay away too! Way to treat your regular customers poorly Cracked Egg.  Shame on you!"}
{"text":"Worse breakfast we've had  out.  Scrabble eggs...nothing great.  Ordered a croissant..waitress offered to heat it...the cook split it in half and grilled it in some disgusting grease.  Ctoisssnt sre dupposed to be light n flaky.  The jam is prepackaged heinz sugary cheap stuff.  The hot chocolate was made w package mix and water. ..very watery so waitress gave me another packet to mix myself.  Coffee was like water.  If uou have a breakfast place...better have great coffee.  Maybe we ordered the wrong thing but if you can't get a basic simple breakfast right. ..we wouldn't try for more."}
{"text":"YUM! This place has never disappointed! The coffee is on point, the coffee cake is different every time and is like heaven no matter the flavor. We've only done breakfast/brunch, but this is an absolute favorite restaurant. There's plenty of menu options and seems like there's always something new and delicious to try."}
{"text":"Family owned and operated restaurant. For our first time in Phoenix for Dodgers spring training we were looking to eat at a non chain related restaurant. Walked in and the restaurant was very busy which was a good sign and we were seated pretty quickly. . . . Decor was old fashioned themed non formal vibe made you feel at home. Because the restaurant was busy it seemed that they were short staffed because it took forever to get our order and drink refills. The food came out room temperature and wasn't that great in taste. We ordered basic breakfast   hard to go wrong. Pancakes were cold and potatoes were over cooked . To make matters worse the bill came to $53 for 1 kids meal and two adults. Needless to say I was very disappointed, however the staff was extremely friendly. That being said I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place to have a excellent breakfast the menu is great with different varieties just a great place to go when looking for a great sit down breakfast brunch din in"}
{"text":"Okay, my boyfriend and I are big breakfast fans. This is our favorite casual breakfast place. I've probably eaten here about 40 times and I have never been let down. I have tried many things but my two favorites are the Country Benny..its Eggs Benedict with a biscuit and sausage and gravy on top. I'm sure its about 5,000 calories but well worth it especially when you are hung over. My other favorite is the El Vaquero...its a chorizo omelette with salsa and cheese on top. Amazing! I know they are owned by the same people, but this one is far better than the one on Rainbow."}
{"text":"Pretty decent! Typical breakfast food.......omelets, scrambles, bacon and eggs, pancakes, etc.  The highlights: ~PUMPKIN walnut coffee cake.......moist and fluffy! ~Build your own skillets........ingenious! ~Lots of booths.  I'm not a table and chair kinda girl.  My complaints: ~The coffee tasted stale and it wasn't really HOT. ~My husband and I weren't greeted or even acknowledged for about 10 minutes after being sat.........NO BUENO! ~The set up of the restaurant at this particular location is pretty poor......front door, hostess stand, people waiting/people eating all in the same small area.  CLAUSTROPHOBIA!"}
{"text":"The food was great, the eggs cooked perfectly. I'd give 5 stars but my waiter was not on the ball."}
{"text":"Service was ok, but I loved my California Omelet and there potatoes.  A lot of food, I couldn't fininsh it all."}
{"text":"I'm just gonna start by saying i think they should re-name this place, \"the crack-egg\" because its probably more addicting than crack. (j/k i wouldn't know). But really. I love breakfast. I love eggs benedict. I love dessert first. I love the Cracked Egg.   I came here this past weekend with a friend and we decided to share a RED VELVET COFFEE CAKE to start. Amazeballs. And it was definitely worth sharing, cause that thing was HUGE. Then we tried the peanut butter french toast. A little too sweet and not peanut-buttery enough for my taste, but it was good. I'll try the croissant french toast next time. And then I had an eggs benedict. By myself. It was delish! I know, i eat like hungry hippo.  Service was alright, nothing to write yelp about. Atmosphere was pleasant. Price was appropriate. I'll definitely be back to eat my way through the rest of the menu :)  The missing star is because of the wait.. Not their fault , but what can i say, i was feelin the HANGER. :/"}
{"text":"One star cause the waitress was nice. But I will say that it's not worth it. Way over priced and staff doesn't care that how your meal was.  For starters we waited at our table for a good 5-7 minutes. I get it, it's Saturday morning and it's busy. We already knew what we wanted but she took our drink orders and left. Now worries we could order when she returns. Having worked at a breakfast joint before (the Egg and I) I get my favorite corned beef hash. My husband orders the burrito enchilada style but the waitress insisted that torri's tortilla was better and she would just get his enchilada sauce on the side for him. Our food came in a decent amount of time. But, well I've Never been to a breakfast restaurant where they do not serve hollandaise sauce with corned beef hash. And my husband saw they had a pork green chili sauce and wasn't too fond of the enchilada sauce. Well......we waited and waited literally 10 minutes for our waitress to finish taking orders for the other table (she's quite friendly and a chatter box) and asked if mine comes with hollandaise and she said she could get some for me and I asked her for some pork green chili sauce and she said sure. Couple minutes later she comes back and the green chili is literally diced green chili. At this point our food has gone cold and I was busy eating my side of hash browns that I was filling up. When I took a bite of my corned beef hash, it tasted like just hash browns. I removed my egg and I was surprised that there were a few strips of corned beef. The rest was hasbrowns and bell peppers. $12.25! Really? Our meal came to &45 for party of 3 where 1 was a kids meal. And when asked how was everything and I replied not too good. They said oh. Want a box! Our plates literally still were full with food. Ridiculous. Not coming back and for this prices not recommending them either. Bye Felicia"}
{"text":"BUGS!!!! All over the booths! My aunt got bit all over her arm took an hour to get our food horrible service, it was very hot in the restaurant thermostat in there said 89. Worth driving to a different location."}
{"text":"2 hours at the cracked egg is not how I wanted to spend my morning.  The food is not as good as Eggworks and the staff is extremely disorganized.  Waited almost an hour as we watched multiple empty tables never being filled and then multiple two top tables being filled ahead of us even though we were in the restaurant at least 30 minutes earlier.    And then finally we paid more for this meal then we have for many good dinners.  This restaurant is just bad."}
{"text":"Had a great working breakfast at the cracked egg. Very complete menu, but was surprised at how well it was prepared and fresh ingredients. I had an Eggs Benedict, it was to perfection. The rest of the food on the table looked magnificent, and the service was very friendly. Would recommend they improve their coffee however in this day and age. Otherwise a fantastic experience overall."}
{"text":"Immediately greeted upon entering and seated. Waitress was attentive to us and provide excellent customer service. We had several staff approach us immediately after seated to get our drink order.  Food was fresh, hot and arrived quick. We waited maybe 10 minutes for our food once we order. Our coffee cup was never empty. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg is a great spot for breakfast if you're looking for that local, homey feel. I went on a weekday and the restaurant was full. There was about a 5-10 minute wait. which was tolerable. It went by very quick though especially since I spent my time looking over their extensive egg menu.  So extensive that I still needed time to look over the menu even after I was seated, but then again I'm really slow when it comes to ordering food so that could have been the reason why.   I ended up with an egg white \"Garden Patch\" omelet. It was fully loaded with spinach, broccoli, mushrooms, tomatoes, and cheese. It was so huge that I couldn't even finish it, but it was delicious!! Also, my dish came with hash browns (or seasoned potatoes if you want) and coffee cake (or toast).   It was a great breakfast and a great way to kick off the morning! I recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"The food was so good. I had 2 eggs, hash browns, corned beef hash and a huge fluffy biscuit. My husband had the French toast.  The serving size is huge and the prices are great. They were busy on that Sunday morning but we only waited 5 minutes. The waitress was fast and knew what she was doing. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've been on this earth for 23 year and finally found the best French toast I ever had!! Get the Peanut butter French toast!! You'll be in peanut heaven!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on a recommendation from some friends. The place was crowded but we were seated within 10 minutes of checking in. I had the eggs Benedict. My first time ever trying the dish and I will need to try it elsewhere to see if i still dislike it. I could say that without ever having it before, I'm sure it is suppose to have some flavor. The holandaise sauce was just a visual effect, nothing to it. Every bite tasted like egg yolk and that's it just bland as could be. The potatoes did have seasoning and flavor and are worth ordering. I felt it was overpriced as well. My wife had pancakes and 2 eggs(sunnyside not over easy as ordered) with bacon coffee and one orange juice( i would of had another but the no one came back until we were finished) and it was over $30. No urgency on returning here."}
{"text":"With tons of other breakfast spots in town, this ones pretty overrated and on the pricey side for what they offer. Nothing worth coming back for. I'd rather take the drive to Du-Pars, where they do breakfast right...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"In the mood for IHOP or Denny's? Go here instead. The quality in both food and service is much higher. Complimentary coffee cake before your meal is really good. Would come here more often if it were closer to me."}
{"text":"Made a to go order from here. Food was fresh and portions were very large. Food was ready about 15 minutes after we placed our order over the phone.    The country fried steak was okay though we weren't a big fan of the gravy. The gravy was a little bland. The country potatoes were also lacking a little flavor in my opinion. The kickin' potatoes were good though perhaps because they were covered in crispy bacon and cheese. Can't go wrong with bacon and cheese.   I did enjoy the Mexican skillet and the scrambled eggs were cooked just right. Probably would've been great with flour tortillas but the rye toast was a sufficient side. Overall not bad. Next time I'll have to try their eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast place in town! Great service and food every time, and I go at least once a week."}
{"text":"Friendly service and pretty good food definitely gets an A-OK in my book. Bigger portions especially when it comes to the \"Big Bad Wolf\" omelet would have earned an extra star or two. The omelet itself was stuffed full of meat but was small by all standards (took up less than half my plate and was half an inch thick).  Coffee cake was absolutely delicious so I am glad I read the reviews and knew to order it. Four dollars for orange juice was pretty steep when the entree itself cost ten dollars. Lesson learned though.   Overall 10$ for a small omelet and 4$ for orange juice leaves me wanting a lot more for the price.  I would go back for the coffee cake but that's really the only thing pulling me back."}
{"text":"I just called in an order the girl was rude on the phone hopefully the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Appreciate the gluten free menu . Although ... If you are a bit sensitive or have celiac's like me , watch out for the seasoned potatoes & gf pancakes . The cross contamination usually gets to me. . I usually get the build your own skillet. , ask for extra crispy hash browns or they will come out undercooked . The coffee is good , and everyone says the house made coffee cake is amazing . Also my husband loves the veggie croissant sandwich . Service is always pretty good too ."}
{"text":"This place is egg-tacular!!! Their food it's awesome!! They are pretty packed throughout the weekend, but if you are dying for some really good home cooked breakfast or lunch, this is your place!! Their turkey pesto tomato is on point! Their cheeseburger skillet is heaven in your mouth! The service is awesome but slow, but it's understandable when it's packed!! Pretty much order anything and you will be flying high on a cloud straight to food heaven!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots! I work nights, and come after I get off of work. Everyone is friendly, food is always good. If you haven't had the raspberry French toast, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"We eat breakfast here often, the food is great!  The staff is so nice.  It is our go-to breakfast spot.  They are cool about customizing orders and it always comes out perfectly. Guests from out of town have enjoyed it as well, the coffee cake is always a hit for them."}
{"text":"Great service and food! They have gluten and diary free pancakes which is something I can never find at a restaurant. They were amazing!! Plus their seasoned potatoes are full of so much flavor. Definitely would recommend and go back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at the cracked egg in Summerlin location.  We were very disappointed with the food and service at this location.   Our waitress was rude and didn't come back after our food came.   The omelette was dry. The ruebin sandwich was a swamp of grease. Fries were burned. When we got the waitress attention and told her the omelette had no cheese she said it was on top and walked away.  Won't go back to this location"}
{"text":"Was not very impressed . It's got 3 starts only because the service was fast we didn't have to wait long to be seated or our food. I was a lil disappointed with our waiter she only checked on us once and that's was to give us the check.  The food was ok I expected a lil bit more originality. They do give a good portion and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We wanted a breakfast away from strip and found this place on Yelp. We only waited 3 minutes and seated outside.  At 11 am, it was nice and in shade.  Our party had an omelet and skillet breakfast.  Husband had senior special. The overall experience was great.  The food was good and and satisfying.  The service was exceptional starting with the adorable hostess, who looked like she may have been an owner."}
{"text":"Now this is a breakfast house! Great quality, Great taste, and a creative menu make for a good time. I believe one would be hard pressed to leave here hungry with the portion sizes too. The eggs benedict comes in many creative varieties, all of them delicious. They also have skillet platters that are sure to fill you up. Lastly, a large slice of crumb cake comes with most breakfast platters. The enviroment is noisy, as its usually filled with customers ( Usually a good sign ) but it is clean and well kept. You can find this place on Cheyenne and Buffalo in the food court. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went to this place to grab a lunch with my niece but we will course ordered breakfast food.  Our server is a little slow and I'm not sure if my order was correct or not but my wheat toast never came. But I did have the order yourself omelette with spinach, sausage and cheese.  It came with country potatoes. It was pretty good."}
{"text":"Their food is to die for! I cannot find anywhere that has my favorites breakfast as delicious as this place. It's a little pricey, but well worth the cost!! The fresh squeezed OJ is amazing too!"}
{"text":"Was here on Sunday. Waitress was fantastic. However we had ants all over our table & had to move. In addition the main reason we went there was to use the $8.00 credit that was on the rewards card I registered for.  However the manager informed me at check out that the credit would have to be used at a different time once the rewards company had mailed it out. Not only that but she was all but rude in how she explained it and was not even apologetic for the ant situation. You would think that under the circumstances she would have at the minimum offered to buy our drinks or something. So very disappointed with how this was handled."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times and the food is great, today was also great! Unfortunately the hostess today was absolutely the crabbiest!!! When we arrived she was on the phone, which appeared to be a personal call. It took her a few minutes to complete her call, never making eye contact with us. When we asked to be seated outside she opened the door and just pointed to a table. She did not smile at all plus made us feel as though we were a huge inconvenience to her. When paying for our meal she never asked if everything was ok, never smiled, just in general very rude. This type of behavior for the employees at this restaurant is very unusual as they are always very nice at the Charleston location. Not sure if we will return! We visited on 4/11/2018, paid our bill at 8:45am."}
{"text":"I really love this place, once we found this gem we've been going back every time we are in Vegas.  The avocado Benedict is my absolute favorite thing to eat there.  Just an awesome place to get breakfast!"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of eating here a couple times and I had a great experience both times.   There is several reasons why I love this place and gave it 5 stars. The staff is very friendly and attentive, they have a huge selection of delicious good quality food and their prices are good. I ordered the cakes and egg combo it comes with pancakes, 2 eggs any style I got scrambled with cheese and also your choice of bacon or sausage I got sausage. Now I know it sounds basic but it was probably the best pancakes and sausage I have ever had from a restaurant the pancakes were fluffy goodness and the sauce was nice and juicy I ate every bite of my plate which is rare for me.   My bf got the chicken fried steak which he devoured in a blink of an eye luckily i grabbed a bite before he finished it off and that too was also delicious ill be getting that next time we go here.   This place is a winner for sure!"}
{"text":"The most outstanding Huevos Rancheros I've ever had. Great service and atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in to have brunch today. We have not previously been to this restaurant. We are glad we came in. We were greeted by a friendly waitress, Dorothy, whom seated us promptly.  We were each handed a menu that is quite extensive with both breakfast and lunch items in which to choose from. My husband chose the Western Scramble, with an English muffin, and I chose the Californian Eggs Benedict with crispy hash browns, and coffee and ice water for both of us.  We didn't have to wait long before the food arrived at our table. The food was hot, and fresh. You can tell that this restaurant chooses and uses only the finest and freshest ingredients.  Dorothy, our waitress, was excellent. She checked on us frequently and always made sure she topped off our coffee. She was friendly and helpful. At the end of our meal, she asked us if we would like a free scoop of ice cream. They have vanilla, chocolate or strawberry. Its the \"REAL\" deal, not out of a machine. The ice cream was perfect. We will definitely be back to this restaurant. It is a wonderful place to eat and it is family owned and operated."}
{"text":"I love this place. I found it on a whim a few years ago while staying on the strip. During this trip to Vegas, I've been twice. The gluten free pancakes are amazing, the service is always good, and the coffee is fresh. I really enjoy my food and the time I have! Apparently, the coffee cake is great. The smell is incredible. Thanks for having such amazing gluten free pancakes."}
{"text":"Mmmmmyeah no. I don't know how this strip mall spot has such amazing reviews because there was not a thing stand out or special about this greasy spoon. Sure? You have the option of coffee cake in lieu of toast.... But it's basically angel food cake with apples in it, so I'm not sure what's exciting about that. Two people in my party excitedly ordered the corned beef hash and neither were excited about or finished their plate. I had the sweet potato and apple skillet which would've had potential if it were a) seasoned even a little b) someone had enough knife skills to properly dice an onion. I really don't need an apple-slice sized piece of caramelized onion. Lastly, the Munster cheese melted on the top just turned into a congealed mess before it even made it to the table. 1 star for pleasant service, 1 star for perfectly Poached eggs."}
{"text":"Ok. This is a traditional breakfast restaurant. They open early and close early, so no breakfast at dinner time for you Las Vegas night shift workers. The servers here are friendly. The meals come in heaping portions. Great breakfast restaurant if you are really hungry and ready to eat!!"}
{"text":"Places like this will put Denny's and ihop out of business. 5 stars is not enough to explain how amazing this place is. Delish."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab breakfast, and I always drag my dad here when he's visiting. I'm a fan of their Joe's Scramble and the Garden Benny; my husband likes the corned beef hash and the southern style eggs benedict. I've also enjoyed their seasonal items like pumpkin pancakes.  They always take great care of us when we visit, almost always with my kiddo in tow. It can get a bit crowded, especially on weekends, but it's always worth the wait."}
{"text":"Why on gods green earth do they only have 4 seater tables? There would be no wait at all at this delicious restaurant if they had two seater tables. Instead, my significant other and I were forced to watch couples and mother-and-son duos eat at large tables for upwards of ten minutes before being given our own overly large table on which to enjoy our meal. Just peeved!  I would say that our waitress was an angel and the food tasted good. Beware the coffee cake-- quite sweet!"}
{"text":"I have to have breakfast here every time I visit! This place does breakfast right! The French toast is amazing, the coffee is delicious , the service is great!"}
{"text":"\"GVP\"- seasoned potatoes were definitely our favorite. Crunchy and delectable! Perfectly seasoned! The omelette itself was good. A lot of avocados which was a plus. I just wish the omelette was a little more juicier per se. Typical omelette though, nothing outstanding.. The potatoes were def the best thing about this dish.   Tropical French toast: really good! Sweet. Lots of sweet fruits. This definitely caught my attention and was pretty unique.   Coffee bread: overhyped! But it's still good, but our least favorite dish of our selection.  The service was pretty good. Atmosphere was nice as well!"}
{"text":"Great place usually but this morning went in.   Was next to get a seat.   Cashier was staring right at me and waiter gave table to people who came in after us.   Will never go again.   I can't stand rudeness."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been coming here almost every Sunday for the past three years. I love everything about it. The waitstaff is extremely friendly and they're always smiling and upbeat. The service is great, even when it's extremely busy, which it usually is on Sundays. I've never had to worry about someone coming to refill my coffee, they always come around and offer refills at the perfect times. The coffee itself is GREAT. Best coffee at a restaurant I think I've ever had, and it's always served hot and tastes fresh. The food has never been disappointing. I tend to order the same two menu items frequently, but any time I try something new it's always good. The only remotely negative thing about this place is it's very popular so there does tend to be a wait time when we come in. However it's usually only 10 minutes tops and I think it's well worth the wait.  I will continue to come here every Sunday for as long as it's open."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 5-6 months since I started working at the building nearby. This place has great food and a big menu to choose from. There have been a few times when they make mistakes with the order, but that's fine, mistakes happen sometimes.  What really upset me today, is since I started coming here, I signed up for the rewards program, which was just a paper that you fill up and you hand to them and they give you a card. When I handed them the filled out paper, they said I'm all set, and they even scanned my card that day so I can get the points for my order.   Today, I decided to log in to the rewards card site to see how much points I have, I was shocked as it said, \"No e-mail is associated with this card number.\" I went and ordered food, and when I got to the restaurant, I mentioned the card issue, and the girl said, \"You were suppose to verify your e-mail from the e-mail that was sent to you.\"  I checked my e-mail and there was never an e-mail sent to me. Does this mean that you guys never even activated my card? All those times that you \"inserted\" my card so I can get my points were all fake? That's not right! and That's not nice!   That means all the points I should have had for the past 5-6 months, was nothing! I literally order here once or twice a week! I could have accumulated a lot of points already!   I am very unhappy and wish for this to be fixed. Other than this situation, this place is great! I will re-write a review if this is fixed."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast! Very hearty portions for the price and tastes as good as it looks. I definitely recommend the French toast and I am not normally a huge fan of French toast. The omelette and the French potatoes were also good options."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's our go-to breakfast place in summerlin. The service is always excellent, quick and friendly. The food is fresh and delicious every time. It's reasonably priced. Can't say enough good things about the Cracked Egg!"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly! The device is amazing and the manager interacts with customers and is super friendly. The food comes in big servings and is so delicious! Love this place!"}
{"text":"We wanted to grab a solid brunch to start our day and this place gave us just that. We arrived about 11:20am on a Sunday. It was just 2 of us, the hostess was better than great with her wait estimate of 10 min, we got seated in about 7 min. We both really like bacon and avocado, so we ordered the Californian omelette with Hash. I opted for the coffee cake which was a nice, sweet, fluffy cake with chocolate and glaze. It's a good substitute to have as a side than pancakes for me. What was awesome was their no holds barred policy of no WiFi, and challenging patrons to be human again in an age without a mobile device and have a verbal conversation."}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg has been a staple in my life for more than a decade. The food is excellent; I have never had something I didn't like. I usually get a typical American breakfast with eggs, meat, potatoes, and/or pancakes. However, the Country Benny is probably the best item on the menu in my opinion (but bring a big appetite cuz it's huge). The manager Armando is a close friend of mine and I liked the place so much I got a job there in high school. They treat their employees very well and it shows in their high quality service. Also, they have a very good loyalty program. You can't go wrong in choosing The Cracked Egg!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. I will be back to try them again. Food came out fast and there server was very attentive. Yummy breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time yesterday after working out. The service was great. The menu has plenty of choices. My wife ordered a skillet which was great. I ordered the Chili Verde Rancheros and the regular hash browns. I am glad they serve regular hash browns.  The coffee cake was tasty however, have you ever microwaved coffee cake and it is really hot in the center plus has a feel that screams microwaved? It was kind of like that. I would rather have a piece of warm coffee cake that did not pass through a microwave(just seems like it did).  My meal was very tasty but the shredded pork in the Rancheros had hard edges like it had been sitting out.  Lastly, when we walked in and asked for a booth, the hostess gave us a gas face as if by asking for a booth we were throwing off the table rotation by not taking a two top.  But...we will be back. If I did not like the place it would get less then 4 stars"}
{"text":"I stopped in while having my car serviced next door.  Clearly a fairly large contingent of regulars!  I didn't have any fancy.. just sausage,eggs and coffee but the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Not many places are open after i get off work at 5:30am, but this place is!  Always used to pass it on my way to my old job but never thought about trying it. I ate there the other day and the food was amazing! The service there is also very good. The atmosphere is relaxing, the last thing i want to hear after a long night of work is loud music and yelling. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone, the menu choices all sound delicious!  Minus 1 star for price. I don't like paying 3 dollars for a glass of milk, when i can get a gallon for that price"}
{"text":"Went on holiday weekend, just had to wait about 20 minutes, so not bad.  Had the verde Rancheros.  Not sure if I would order it again.  I did like how the eggs were runny under all if the cheese and meat.  Service was excellent.  Seem to have an extensive menu, but did not see chiliquiles on the menu, which is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place I've been to here!! I got the southwest omelet and it was YUMMY! Wow who thought of that one? I will be trying this at home.   5 stars on service  5 stars on food 5 stars on cleanliness   I can't say much else!"}
{"text":"After my yoga class with my gf, had a pretty decent breakfast here... I like the feel of the restaurant, laid back!!  Definitely will go back again!"}
{"text":"Great local spot in Vegas. This is our second time here. We came for breakfast here the other morning, service was awesome, food was awesome- so much so that we came again for breakfast today. Only bummer about this morning there is a wait to be seated, the entire waiting area is full of people waiting - so my husband and I waited outside.... Summer, 100 degree weather at 11:00 am- ugh. If you do come- try the coffee cake. It's a very light airy type cake. Not your typical dense coffee cake. Plus, this one has peach;)  But the French Toast is delicious, compared to other places I eaten. The Eggs Benedict too. Just a super cute little spot to grab breakfast."}
{"text":"I love the corn beef hash and its very FILLING  me and my friends left very satisfied"}
{"text":"We had a party of 6 and was told it would be 15 minutes for a seat.  As we waited I watched 3 or 4 parties of 6&7 seated before us.  When we nicely asked what was going on the ignorant host snapped at us and we walked out.  They have horrible customer service skills.  We used to frequent the Cracked Egg often. We will not be eating there any longer. Just because your busy and have high volume that's no excuse for snippy attitudes. Learn how to speak to customers.  0 stars."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We tried for the first time recently and it was delicious. The chorizo was the best I have ever had. The service was very good and quick. All workers were warm and friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Simply yummy! The scrambles are so good, especially when you get them with the seasoned potatoes and coffee cake."}
{"text":"Super cute and delicious! Love when you can enter a restaurant and feel like you are truly in a family kitchen. The atmosphere vibe is laid back and homey. The food portions are very generous and oh so delicious! If your looking for an awesome breakfast waffle or an amazing salad for lunch this is the hidden gem! The service is great too! My only complaint is that they are only open for breakfast and lunch! Wish they were open for dinner too!"}
{"text":"F* b-i-t-c-h waitress gave us the worst service. I was nice about it, signed for the bill and still gave her a standard 15% tip. Guess what this b-i-t-c-h did? she changed the tip amount, and my credit card statement just came and she charged me $2 more for tips. wtf? That's fraud!  Food was absolutely nasty. Everything was fried in lard and my throat was scratchy from all that oil. I asked for eggs over easy, and guess what? they broke the yolk! I really wanted to through it in her face, but had to work really hard to apply Confucious' anger management skills. argh!  Absolutely terrible experience. Don't ever go there!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't believe in seasoning any of their food. Super greasy food. I asked the server what kind of steak was on their steak and egg dish. Nobody knew. She asked all of her co workers. First they said it was New York then some guy sitting in the office said it was just random pieces of random steaks. Try menu testing your staff once in a while. It would be easier for the customer to know what we're getting if the server knew what they are selling. You might want to train your cooks to use gloves while cooking and your servers to not grab the toast I'm about to eat with their bare hands."}
{"text":"I had an incredible experience here once again! I had bacon and eggs. They were very good. The food got on the table in literally 5 minutes. Service was good."}
{"text":"You could make this food yourself. It just wouldn't be this good.  The Good: It's exactly what you'd expect: charming breakfast food. Only it comes with amazing hash browns and toast. Also the non-breakfast food here is great too: good burgers, sandwiches, etc... I think of this as the original egg based breakfast joint in Vegas. I'm sure they didn't invent the concept, but it's great, fast, and consistent.  The food isn't 'creative' per se, it's exactly as diverse as it needs to be. They have specials that are usually pretty excellent in and of themselves.  The bad: Well, they close at three and they serve jelly in the standard little containers measuring 1/20th of a teaspoon. You need like thirty for one piece of toast.   WTF: GREEN AND BLACK MINTS ARE NOT DELICIOUS. KILL THEM WITH FIRE.  Suggestion: pancakes are an untapped creative medium. Please consider."}
{"text":"I love YELP!!   While staying in Las Vegas, went looking for a good place to have breakfast.  I have to admit I'm very picky about where I eat.  The restaurant has to be clean, have good food, creative menu, and great service.  Extra bonus to a family owned restaurant and not a chain.  This place fit the bill.    I had ham and eggs, and the ham was big and thick, not bone in, but very flavorful.  Eggs cooked just right, seasoned potatoes were perfect.  Was a great place to stop for breakfast.  They also have a senior menu which was perfect for my family members traveling with me."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's always packed but the wait time isn't that long. If you're in prison on death row, unsure of what you should choose as a last meal, try the peanut butter stuffed frnech toast. Scrumptious."}
{"text":"One of my FAVORITE breakfast places. The staff is super friendly and makes sure everything is perfect. I ordered the Mexican skillet and added spinach and it was delicious! They amount they give you is a lot too so I had left overs to take home.   I do believe it's a family owned business and they make you feel so welcomed .  I always recommend this spot for delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"Not sure what the high demand is about. Food wasn't bad but wasn't that good. We had great service from the front desk and waitress. Very efficient considering how busy they are. Nothing special. Wont be back. I ordered the enchilada omelette and my fiance ordered the Greek omelette. He agrees this place is OVER RATED. But again the atmosphere is upbeat and friendly."}
{"text":"This was our first experience here. We arrived on a Saturday morning around 7 and beat the normal crowds we have seen seated on the benches outside the restaurant.  We had a 4-year-old and 4-month-old with us, so we are always on edge about how eating out will be. The staff was friendly and efficient. They brought our older son his pancakes out first so he could get started (always appreciated!).  Food was excellent- crunchy hash browns, melt-in-your-mouth chocolate chip pancakes, amazing Mexican-style Eggs Benedict, and juicy A-1 Steak Scramble. Definitely will make this a monthly excursion!"}
{"text":"Consistently good. I came here once in 2011 before I lived in Vegas and remembered it when I moved here and have come back many times.  I had the chili skillet, seasoned potatoes, chili, over easy eggs and I added jalapeños and onions because I love spicy. The season coffee cake was strawberry which was excellent however I've come to the conclusion their coffee cake isn't really coffee cake, it's more like a hybrid angel food cake but it's still delicious. The last few times I've visited the coffee cake has been a fruit that I'm allergic too so it was great to finally have a piece that wasn't mango or peach. I think they should have a regular like crumb/brown sugar coffee cake as an option as well, I feel like they'd do a great job at it.   Go eat breakfast here, it's delicious"}
{"text":"I cannot lie I come here for the coffee cake. Pretty standard breakfast menu, nothing special. If it weren't for the coffee cake I probably wouldn't come."}
{"text":"Really nice staff and great service. The menu has lots of options. I just think it's a bit pricey compared to some other breakfast places that are similar. It's nearly $7 for just a 2 egg breakfast which is a bit excessive. Again, nice staff and I'd probably go back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Changed hands a couple times. Gets even better every time. It's definitely a brighter place in Glendale. They serve wonderful home-cooked meals and a super price and smiles from other servers."}
{"text":"Every time my boyfriend and I come here we get amazing service and the food is the bomb. The restaurant is always clean and the staff makes you feel like family. Never have I come here and not liked everything about this place. A++"}
{"text":"Definitely a good place to grab a quick breakfast. Also a decent meeting spot for business breakfasts and lunches. Personally, I think you can do better with the food but all around it is a bad joint."}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious,  I ordered build your own omelet and a side of corn beef hash. Coffee was non stop and our waitress penny kept checking on us.. I recommend this place to anyone who wants a big breakfast and good service"}
{"text":"Mom and I stopped in to my favorite breakfast joint on the way to the airport.  I decided to try something I haven't tried before, so I went with the Peanut Butter & Cream Cheese stuffed French Toast w/Bananas.  After a short wait, our oder came out.....their portions are enough to feed two people!  I wish they offered a 1/2 order.  Oh well, I did my best to finish this thing, but it proved to be too much for me.  The combination of Peanut Butter and Cream Cheese was awesome!  It was so good I didn't need any Syrup or Butter added to it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/74pWjFssgqyhaVg-YCUo3A?select=sJ_90yVfA6dYgPpZs5qXQg  Another great breakfast experience!  Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"Met a business associate here for a breakfast meeting the other day.  I rarely come to this Cracked Egg location, but it was convenient at the time.  I ordered the Short Stack (2 giant Pankcakes).  They were very good, as usual.  The Cracked Egg rarely disappoints.  This location was very busy when we were here on a Friday morning.  However, the server kept up with the craziness and we were well taken care of.  We also took our time since we were there to discuss business matters....not once were we felt unwelcome because we were taking our time.  Overall, great service, great food.  Will I return?  You bet."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service from waitress Penny. I can't say enough about waitress Penny's great service!! When I commented about the food, she readily replaced it. The fried potato were bad. And they slightly tasted of freezer burn. I did not finish them. And I will not be taking them home.  The omelette was excellent it was best thing I had for my meal. The sourdough toast I told her to put extra butter on it and she did. That was great! However it is it highly of salt so I guess I should've asked for non-salted butter. The biscuits and gravy where OK. The gravy was good but the biscuits were hard as rocks. Hard to cut into. They crumble when I would try to eat them. Did expect a little bit better for the biscuit and gravy due to the reviews that I read about them. Showed the consistency of the biscuits and gravy to the waitress and she replace them for me.  The second time around was better :-) restroom cleanliness was ok. Could be better. No handicap restroom. Hmmm.... overall not bad. I'll go back for their excellent customer service and great prices!!"}
{"text":"I was desperately needing to get away from the strip. I couldn't take the cigarette smoke, or the need to resist cheap alcohol at every turn, or the expensive food. I really just wanted a quiet, peaceful gluten-free brunch before attending a family wedding. And we got just that.   It was perfect weather outside when we came. There was a nice breeze and just the loveliest kiss of warmth from the sun. Service from all staff was welcoming and friendly. To top it off, they had a separate gluten-free/celiac-friendly menu! I was immediately drawn to the gluten-free pancakes, toast, and muffins. I got myself a delicious corned beef hash with a warm chocolate muffin! I couldn't be happier with my morning, especially when prices were under $10.   I am glad to have a found a local breakfast joint that is not too far from the strip. Now I have a go-to gluten-free diner whenever in Vegas."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Seems family owned and operated with people there who might not be too experienced. Had a simple French toast was okay and upon seeing the workers there. I noticed most of them had an assembly line going on. Someone specifically cutting the bread there. Putting things in and out of microwaves. Their pumpkin bread cake. Pancakes even microwaved. I probably could have made the same quality of food in my kitchen. It's just goes to show if you have a market and your in there at the right place, at the right time."}
{"text":"We really like this place. It is much better than Fast Eddies was and the selection of food is terrific. They have good burgers and breakfasts. I have had the gyro platter as well and enjoyed it. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 stars is that the service can sometimes be spotty. We have had great waitresses and then horrible waitresses. Happily the food sees us through it and we always hope for the best with the servers."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times. Every time has been great. One of our favorite breakfast spots in Vegas. They always get you seated fast even on weekends. The omelets are huge and filling. They have different types of coffee cake depending on the day, raspberry has been my favorite so far. They also have a great menu for people with gluten allergy which is nice."}
{"text":"This is a good breakfast spot. Be prepared for a wait on weekend mornings, as they are usually very busy.  I usually end up ordering the same thing: Chicken Fried Steak Skillet. It is a chicken fried steak over a bed of house potatoes, smothered in delicious gravy and topped with copious amounts of cheese. I usually order the two eggs that come with in on the side rather than on the skillet.   I am not a fan of their omelettes. I think they lack a little flavor and flare, especially for the cost.   One thing that is great here is their coffee cake. They usually have a different flavor every time I go.   My main complaint about this place, aside from their omelettes (I like omelettes with meat, and their big bad wolf omelette (or whatever it is called) is definitely not laden with meat as you are led to believe) is that their service is slow. While I don't work there so can't know for sure, I would attribute it to how busy they are and a staff that is not large enough to handle everything. They also have a waitress there who never seems to like what she is doing. When I go out for breakfast, I don't want to deal with other people's problems and bad moods. That needs to be checked at the front door when the waitress comes in to work.   Aside from that, I do like this place, especially their chicken fried steak skillet.     Would I recommend this place to others? Yes.  Would I come back here myself? Yes."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in a long time!!  My husband and I met a friend here over the holidays while we were in Vegas and talked about the place to everyone the rest of the trip!  They do a great job but get there early so you don't have a long wait!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this restaurant.  The food is great and the staff works together like a well-tuned machine to make sure service is always excellent.  Great locals spot but you often see celebrities dining here!  TIP:  the portions are large but often come in half portions - ask your server."}
{"text":"Excellent food!! We come here a lot have tried most everything from breakfast to lunch. The coffee cake is awesome. Service is always friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Food is home made, fresh and fabulous!! Coffee cake to die for!! Come hungry and leave with a to go box. The staff is amazingly friendly constantly, and take the time to learn your name likes and dislikes."}
{"text":"Went to visit family in Vegas, they suggested trying the Cracked Egg. Nice clean place. Serving staff were very good, attentive, and helpful. Their dishes are plentiful and we were not disappointed with any of the dishes we ordered. The food came out quickly. You get a choice of coffee cake or bread. I chose cake my wife the bread, we shared and it turned out perfect. I'll be back when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Was here yesterday with my husband and just stopped by because of the stars. My husband ordered a chorizo meal with avocado. I ordered pan cakes. It looked like a manager who brought our food out to us. He drops it off without asking does everything look correct? So had to wait 15 minutes to flag waitress down to tell her we didn't get avocado or toast with his meal then my baby syrup covered like half my pancakes. By the time he got his avocado slices he was done with his meal. No apology or taken off. Food wasn't great or special so we will not be back or recommend."}
{"text":"Visiting from California and wanted the local experience and we were pleased the food was made in house and delightful"}
{"text":"Someone wrote a positive review about their eggs Benedict so I tried it. Edible but nowhere close to what it should taste like. Server was pleasant and attentive. Good coffee. I would come back and have something else from the menu."}
{"text":"Slipped into a food coma halfway through the meal. Service is great. Food is even better. Wear your stretchy pants!"}
{"text":"Good Portions and delicious fresh coffee cake. The eggs were off the chain! This is a very busy place and their waitress' provide excellent service. If you want a very filling breakfast, you're at the right place."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my food at The Cracked Egg. The wait was a little long for how many tables they have in the restaurant. It looked like they had too many couples at booths and larger tables. My boyfriend and I were placed in a booth. Otherwise...  My Huevos Rancheros was so delicious! My boyfriend got the Chile Verde Rancheros. The pork looked amazing and my boyfriend couldn't even finish it all. I might be a fatty but I devoured the hell out of my huevos rancheros. So hard to resist the urge to gorge with amazing food set in front of me.  As far as the hash browns, I won't be getting them again. The seasoned potatoes that my boyfriend got were delightful and I tried not to eat them all. I will definitely be getting them in the future! I just hope that the line isn't as long as it was the first time we went. Good food is worth it though. :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at The Cracked Egg and I must say it left a great impression on me.   The hostess was very bland and straight forward. Although she wasn't rude, she wasn't very friendly either. Our waitress, Emily, was very friendly and attentive.   Now to the food ... I ordered a \"build your own skillet\" with pastrami, bacon, mushrooms, bell peppers, spinach, & broccoli. It was AWESOME; filled flavor and was very appealing to the eyes. My wife ordered the two egg combo with a waffle and potatoes; instead of eggs. I thought her food look great; she said it tasted average.   The eggs are definitely fresh but the potatoes are definitely from a bag.   Overall, the atmosphere was good, the food was delicious, & the service was great!"}
{"text":"To start off, some of the complaints people have about this place are ridiculous. One person complained they don't have wifi. Is your company or ADHD really that bad that you can't hold a conversation with them? Is multi tasking really that much more important than sitting back and relaxing for 45 mins? What could you possibly be doing that's so important that you really need wifi for anyway? And no. If I'm there trying to enjoy a meal on the patio, I don't want someone's dog there, regardless of breed or size. Unless it's a service dog, why would you expect to bring it everywhere like an accessory? I'm sure they would rather lose the one customer that was butthurt they couldn't bring their animal to breakfast instead of losing three or four customers that would want a dog there. As for the service complaints, there are no complaints from me. I came for a quick breakfast with my mom. Everything came out fast and hot. We were asked if we had everything we need and if we needed anything else, let her know. Then we were left alone to eat and have a conversation without the server coming by every few minutes interrupting us asking if we needed anything. If I we did need anything, we would have gotten her attention and communicated with her instead of rearranging some dishes on the table and hope that she could read our minds that we needed something specific.  My mom got a veggie skillet which looked good, but not my type of thing. Plus I was craving their chocolate chip banana pancakes which definitely hit the spot. I also had scrambled eggs and sausage patties which you can't really mess up. If you think the food is bland, there is not much to do about that. It's all about personal preference and restaurants can't please everyone. They aim to please as many as they can, usually. Other places do what they do regardless of people's opinions. But that's usually certain types of food. Overall I've never had a bad experience here, and I would definitely go back. As for the price, meh, not too cheap or expensive. If you say you'd rather go to Mcd's then so be it. That's another case of opinion. Maybe you prefer that peculiar Mcd's flavor that's in all of their products. I'm not sure what that is, but I'm sure you know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"I like that The Cracked Egg is a locally owned business.  It's always nice to support locals.   Whether sitting at the counter (no waiting) or in the main dining area (usually a wait), I have consistently experienced good service at the Cracked Egg.  At times it's a little slow, but they get very busy during weekend brunch, so it's hard to find fault with that.  You'll find typical American breakfast and lunch fare here.  Not much that would pique your interest to venture off the beaten path; but sometimes you're just looking for familiar comfort food.  Their omlettes, scrambles, and bennies are all tasty and hearty.  Their burgers are juicy and flavorful, and their salads fresh and cruchy.  Their pancakes are good too, but they're no Dupar's or Babystacks.  The space itself is large and clean, but could really use a decorator's touch.  Side benefit of The Cracked Egg is it's proximity to Popcorn Girl :)."}
{"text":"Amazing waitstaff, Erin, being an outstanding waitress! The food was delicious. Don't leave without their coffee cake! The Joe's Scramble was spot-on--a recommendation from Erin. Wish we could take her back to Kansas with us!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Cracked Egg twice now and it hasn't disappointed yet. A fun, simple and tasty breakfast. Both times I have gone have been on weekday mornings and the service is fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Good breakfast good coffee good people ! Get some grub before morning activities  Only one thing ...... No wifi arghhhhhhh!!!!!! All good though !!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat...fast service...excellent food."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and loved it! Our new breakfast place! Talk about a delicious coffee cake! Sinful! My favorite is The Californian omelet ... And service is quick! You definitely don't sit hungry for long! The wait staff is friendly and overall a great environment!"}
{"text":"Service and food were both AMAZING! The food was all fresh and cooked to perfection, Cory was so sweet with us! We will be coming back next time we're in Vegas, for sure!"}
{"text":"I always get the Taylor scramble cream cheese and green onins ...YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"You would think most restaurants these days would make there main business about why you come to restaurants in the first place, food and fellowship.  The wait was horrendously excessive.  After waiting 45 minutes to be seated, it took another 45 minutes to receive our food.  When I finally get my meal, it was all just pre made packaged food.  Look at the photo of my breakfast, those potatoes were pre-seasoned and nothing to brag about.  I will not be coming back for the simple fact, the wait was just so damn long!!!  Wasted two and half hours of my life."}
{"text":"We were looking for a breakfast place and found this via yelp.  Happy to see a place other than the chain IHOPS/Dennys that serves up a good breakfast.  Staff was friendly, prices were good, nice sized place so it handled our group of 14 easily.  We'll be back I'm sure."}
{"text":"I'm a breakfast junkie. If runny eggs and pancakes were a drug I would be serving a life prison sentence right now and cooking contraband fried eggs with my moonshine.  I've known the Cracked Egg was there, but I was sticking to what I knew. Alternatives in the area include the stellar fine dining of IHOP or Mimi's Cafe. I'm pretty sure those two places also serve as alternatives for nursing home field trips on the weekends.   We actually tried the Cracked Egg on the recommendation of a friend, which is funny since we don't actually have any friends. That is how good it is.   I like the portions and the food is much higher quality than IHOP. You can literally taste chicken suffering in IHOP's eggs, so the eggs with slightly fewer injected hormones are refreshing and appreciated by both my digestive system and my delicate pallet. The food has been good every time I've visited the Cracked Egg.   They also have a rewards card you can get and add to your ridiculous reward card collection, and they will send you a pretty good $8 coupon each month. It actually turns out cheaper than another breakfast place even without the coupon. And I enjoy it more, so it's a win either way. Except for my digestive system because it doesn't know me and it doesn't understand my life.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because their service is sometimes on the \"ignoring you\" level of bad. I expect a minimum of mediocre service every time because I am such a demanding customer and stuff."}
{"text":"We stayed at red rock and wanted a quick breakfast before heading out. And found this place little over a mile away from the resort.  We got there around 8 on a Sunday morning. There was no wait. We got seated right away.  The service was great! There are a ton of menu selections yo choose from.  We got the corned beef hash, north shore scramble and the kids got chocolate chip pancakes.   I personally didn't like the corned beef. The corned beef was just ok. I got it with their popular coffee cake and seasoned potatoes.  The north shore scramble was ok, if you like onions then this is the one for you. We don't like onions THAT much so we didn't care for it.   The kids liked their chocolate chip pancakes. It tasted like any other chocolate chip pancake. Nothing special. It was just the pancakes, no fruit or meat option unless you order a side order.   Would we go back...probably not.     The coffee cake was light and arrived warm to the table. If I could sum up that coffee cake, it seemed like an angel cake with something (like an apple compote or jam) on the bottom and topped with an icing glaze."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked for a while and we finally got a chance to try It!  There was no wait when we got there (Black Friday 8 am). We got seated and was immediately greeted and our drink orders were taken. Shortly after that our friendly server took our order. Within 5-8 mins our food came out.   We ordered the homemade corned beef and the short stack chocolate chip pancakes (3 huge pancakes) for my kids to share.    The corned beef wasn't anything like I expected...the corned beef was thinly stripped with diced peppers, onions and hash brown potatoes mixed together. It also came with hash browns and their homemade coffee cake. Their portions are big so I shared with my husband.  All in all, it was good, service was good.   I would go back!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! Breakfast or lunch you won't be disappointed! Thereskillets, muffins, sandwiches, ranch, etc is ahhhh-mazing!  The staff is always super sweet and on top of their game!   Oh, and I love doing take out orders too. Quick and order always correct"}
{"text":"I enjoy going to the cracked egg. I don't go often, but when I do--it's usually this location (although I've been to all of them), and they seem to always get it right here. I've never had to complain about my food (although I order the same thing every time for brunch-chicken fingers and hash browns with whatever coffee cake is being served). That's unless I get the BLT, which is great as well. The feel of the location is very \"at home having brunch or lunch in your kitchen,\" it's small, usually packed, but the staff is great at getting people in and out in a timely and orderly fashion. Try to avoid the location off Ann/95--there's always issues there."}
{"text":"Great location...place is new and is nice. The service needs improvement. We waited. About 20 mins before anyone took our order...food is great on the other hand"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot in the city.  The food is great. I typically get the Joe's Scramble... eggs, ground beef, and cheese... oh my!  The food is reasonably priced with a large breakfast and lunch selection.  The service is always nice and the food comes out pretty fast. Of course like any good restaurant as it gets busy the service gets a little slow but for this place its not a problem. They still remain cool calm and pleasant under the pressure. My type of spot! I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant spot!  The service is always friendly and the food is always delicious.  I typically get the Joes Scramble. Its ground beef, eggs, scallions, cream cheese delicious doesn't even begin to cover it. Their potatoes are good and their coffee cake is to die for.  This absolutely goes without saying I will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, friendly staff with great food. Large, appetizing portions. No complaints. Awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The service is quick and friendly, and the portions are huge. I ordered a soup and sandwich for lunch and the soup came in the biggest bowl I have ever seen. I was full before I even got to the sandwich! (But ate it anyways, I could never pass up a BLT)  I have been a few times now and they are always very accommodating with substitutions and special requests. The burgers and omelettes also have large portion sizes. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in Vegas. Have been here for both breakfast and lunch. The servers are great and are always happy looking. To date I have tried the country Benni, homemade corned beef hash, the Mexican skillet, the enchilada omelette, chicken fried steak, Reuben, patty melt, bleu cheese bacon burger, and the open faced chili burger. The chili is excellent. The homemade corned beef hash was a bit disappointing. My go to favorite is the country Benni. Breakfast on the weekends is a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"The food was average.  We had to ask for a refill on the coffee and it was never offered again. This is not a place we will return to."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is great.  I was looking for some place for my sisters, friends and I to meet up with a relative that was near our hotel.  The Cracked Egg showed up on my google search, and I'm so glad it did.  We got there shortly after 9 on a Saturday morning with 6 people.  It took about ~20 minutes to seat us, which was expected.  I had looked over the menu while waiting, so by the time we sat down I knew what I wanted.  In fact, as soon as I saw it on the menu I didn't even have to keep looking.  Peanut butter stuffed french toast drizzled with bananas and honey.  This was one of my most favorite breakfasts ever.  It was like heaven on a plate!  All of the food we got was really good.  2 of the people I was with got coffee cake with their breakfasts, and boy was I jealous!  The type of coffee cake varies by whatever pan happens to come out of the oven, and they ended up with peach.  It was moist and warm and so good.  Breakfasts ordered:  Eggs Benedict, Monte Cristo, bacon cheeseburger skillet, and at least one other thing that I don't remember because I didn't taste it.  Everything was good.  I'm glad I got to taste a little bit of eveything, because they were all delicious.  I still stand by my decision of the peanut butter french toast.  yummy!  I can't wait until next Sept. when I'll be out there again for a repeat trip!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal nor a bad server here. Reasonably priced and delicious coffee cake. ALWAYS GET THE COFFEE CAKE! It changes daily and I pour some coffee over it and really enjoy before my entree arrives. My fiance and I often get the cornbeef and hash as well as the chicken fried steak and eggs and then share with each other.  Seriously my favorite breakfast place in town. There are plenty of options for lunch though I can never seem to get passed my favorites. I have tried a bite of other family members meals. The eggs Benedict and traditional French toast they ordered were enjoyed by all! Good portion size too."}
{"text":"Yummy! We eat here when we have family in town and don't want to destroy our kitchen to make 4 different breakfasts! They make homemade DELICIOUS coffee cake, and their own fresh salsa still warm from the stove....goes perfect on my eggs without making them cold! I love that they also have gluten free options too."}
{"text":"Great place to get food quality breakfast food for a great price. Off the strip so there aren't any touristy people. Just a good local spot to get stuffed!"}
{"text":"First off, I am very dedicated customer of this establishment. I've been going to Cracked Egg for quite a long time, and tend to frequent it 2-3x a week.   This past Sunday, there was an approximate 15-20 minute wait for a table, which considering it's a Sunday morning is not surprising. After waiting for about 12 minutes or so, this woman and her two teenage kids comes in and puts her name down.....only to be seated in front of everyone else one minute later. I said something to the host, who responded, \"Yeah, that shouldn't happen.\" and DID NOTHING. I was so infuriated that I stormed out of the restaurant and have vowed not to come back.   I find that extremely rude and unprofessional and completely disrespectful to ALL the other customers waiting like everyone else."}
{"text":"Went right after going to a doctor's appointment in the same parking lot area. Awesome location if you are just ending an 8 hour fast, lol. I got an omelet and my wife got one of their salad. Both were very good, especially given the crowd in the restaurant at the time (it was a wednesday which makes me shudder to think of how packed this place gets on a weekend morning). Service was good and fairly prompt, price was very reasonable, I'd say its a good bet that I shall be returning next time I am in the area! =)"}
{"text":"In town from California and after reading the Yelp reviews we came for breakfast/lunch. The 3 of us decided on sandwiches and added dinner salads w/ ranch dressing  (super yummy). We ordered the Philly, Pastrami, and Vegas Chicken sandwiches. Everyone loved their food and couldn't stop eating even after being full! The service was very friendly & attentive. We would definitely recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"We went early (8AM) for Sunday breakfast ( family of 7).  There was certainly plenty of food ( but is quantity better than quality?).  I had Tropical French Toast.  Too much toast too little flavor. Hubby had Cheeseburger and Bacon Skillet...just toooo much. Kids had a variety of eggs and toast etc... nothing tremendously exciting.  Only drinks were orange juice for 3/7 and the bill was $88 with tip.  Service was satisfactory ( not outstanding). The place became quite busy by 9AM and would certainly be standing room by 10AM.  Can't give a bad review, all the food was OK and there was alot.  BUT not a place I would go to week after week.  The coffee cake ( tasted my sons) was good but not the best I ever tasted( a little dry)."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday morning, very busy.. Expected the wait to be an 1 hour, but luckily for us, we were seated after waiting only 20 minutes.    There was so much to choose from. But I simply went with scrambled eggs turkey sausage and hash browns and wheat toast. The wait was about 15 minutes. I Requested my eggs scrambled medium.  Let me first start off, my eggs were a bit still watery which threw me off. My turkey sausage was really dry, and I do wish my hash browns was cooked more, no crispness or browning on the hash brown. It was a bit depressing. I still ate it all because I was hungry.   Breakfast is so simple to cook, how could you not know how to hit all the right points on it. I'm not trying to be mean, probably it was just busy and it got hectic in the kitchen, sh*t happens.. But  if I'm ever in area, Id rather pass on this place.    But the customer service was great! The place is awesome tho. Looks like a big kitchen."}
{"text":"I only have good things to say about the Cracked Egg. They always have fantastic service. I love their coffee cake and seasoned potatoes. Great place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"A great place to get fresh home cooked food. I love their coffee cake!!!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. i went with a friend and they were really accomadating as  I had my baby in a car seat so they made sure we had a place to put her as some of the booths are small.  I got the bacon and cheese omelette with bacon and cheese with potatoes and coffee cake. For 8.95 I thought it was a fair price. Some of their items seemed a bit pricey but the food was good quality.  The coffee cake was different than i am used to, I am used to pretty dense cake but this was really light almost like a sugar cloud.  i would return its better than the chaon places for sure.."}
{"text":"This place is to breakfast as Wonder Woman is to star spangled knickers. The pesto scramble was ridiculously delicious. I descended on it in an egg frenzy, like a yolk smeared Cookie Monster who just finished an hour of cardio. The waitress was this chirpy, smiling maelstrom of efficient food delivery and coffee pourage. She even laughed at one of my jokes. Try this place. Just try it. You'll look back on that breakfast as the day dwindles and the golden honey light soaks your living room and think \"Yes. That was good.\""}
{"text":"Love coming to the cracked egg. Generous delicious portions. The coffee cake is such a bonus!!"}
{"text":"After my doctor's appointment this morning, I stopped here for breakfast.  The place opened recently and I wanted to check it out knowing that it was part of a chain.  Before looking at the menu, one of the bus people came and brought me coffee. I first checked the specials board.  Then I looked over the menu.  After some thought, I went with one of the specials and ordered a Cordon bleu skillet.  The skillet had potatoes, chicken, ham, and swiss cheese and Hollandaise.  I got my two eggs over easy and rye toast.  In less than five minutes, my server brought the skillet over and it looked great!  It also tasted that way.  The chicken pieces were real chicken--not formed chicken.  The swiss cheese covered the top.  I was pleasantly surprised that the skillet was not heavy on cubed potatoes to use a cheaper ingredient to cut back on the ham and chicken.  My coffee was refilled without waiting and service was good.  I'm glad we now have a good breakfast place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Very very good service...wait time was short and well worth it...so good went back with friends the next morning! Different server same great place"}
{"text":"I stopped here for breakfast yesterday and it was very good.  I ordered the Tropical French toast, two pieces of bread dipped in egg, coated with some toasted coconut and macadamia nuts, and nicely grilled.    I sat at the counter and the place was quite busy.  Maybe it just seemed that way because no one was eating outside because it was RAINING!    Service was very quick and everyone was pleasant and had a nice smile.  I only had one cup of coffee but I was asked about a refill.  I was giving platelets later and I didn't want to be sitting the hour and a half in the chair when the coffee want to leave me.  Also, thanks to the restaurant for having a half order as an option.  That was just enough!  One thing that would really make this breakfast tropical would be to replace the maple syrup with coconut syrup.  Now that's tropical!"}
{"text":"COFFEE CAKE!!!!  It's the best here. I love that they change flavors of coffee cake here and there. I once had pumpkin coffee cake last fall and it was amazing! This Cracked Egg is better than other locations. The service is always great and quick!  For some reason I did not know that the owner was one of the original owners of Egg Works that branched off mutually and independently. Sorry to compare but the potatoes are just not as crack like as Egg Works. They are still very yummy though.   I normally just get the sausage, eggs and potatoes which sets me back $7.95. My hubby always gets one of the skillets which is always way too much food! Leftovers!  My only gripe is the lack of alcohol. There is none. I am a night-shifter so breakfast is like my dinner and I love me some mimosas.."}
{"text":"It is a nice new spot. Went for breakfast with a girlfriend and we both had the country breakfast which was great! The eggs were a little under cooked but that was okay. The menu is a little overwhelming but the server was friendly and the place was clean. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"They have, by far, the best coffee cake I have ever had. I seriously could have just eaten that for my breakfast, and ditched the omelet. However, the chorizo in the omelet could have been stronger, but it was still a good omelet. The seasoned home fries were also good. Even though this place is a bit off the strip, it was worth the trip."}
{"text":"The montecristo is the best and for a decent price. Would definitely recommend to family and friends."}
{"text":"Sat and waited for a counter for 15 minutes. A couple that came in after me where seated at the counter before me, then when I went up to see when I was going to be called they said next, and proceeded to seat a guy that just walked in to the seat I was waiting for.   I called and asked for a manager, they asked who I was. Told her my name and they hung up on me.   Love the cracked egg, this location treats random people like crap.  Not a good way to start the day."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the world. Great staff. Great prices. Enough said."}
{"text":"Best Monte Cristo in town! The service is friendly and prompt, and the food is always delicious!"}
{"text":"I had the carnitas omelet here the other day.  It really was more of a green chili omelet.  Nothing special; a decent place for a breakfast meal."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! This place has an amazingly wide and varied menu to choose from. I tried the Farmers Benedict and am in love! My fiance and I are already planning what to get the next time we make it in!"}
{"text":"Choose this location over the painted mirage one! Food is always what should be & they comply with allergies.   They're quick & much more friendly. 10/10"}
{"text":"Why am I not surprised. Yet again. I asked for no eggs on my food. Guess what! They didn't care. They put it on my food told me hey had to remake it.   My meal comes out. Small portioned. Which I thought hey w/e we all have bad days maybe they didn't have enough meat. Mm ok whatever. Onwards, I flipped my food around and saw egg. :) when they promised they'd remake it. Not just scrape it off. Pretty sure that's not okay to do in food business. I'm glad I'm not extremely allergic otherwise I would have been in the hospital longer!!!   This place honestly probably has a D - for their cleanliness.   Don't give this disgraceful sit down any business.    Update:: Still terrible!   I gave this one another shot. Wasted money & time.  I get my usual skillet. But what I received was a side of effing potatos. No cheese. My families eggs weren't done. & had shells!!) Talk about how you can make your customers sick. On top of it all they forgot my coffee cake.   This place has gone completely down hill.   The one on Cheyenne is extremely nicer. More attentive. & foood cautious.   Shame on you, CE!!!!"}
{"text":"Come hungry. Just what you would imagine a home-style breakfast should be, with portions a plenty.  I'm a corned beef hash fan, except when it comes from a can (which is how most places serve it.)  This really is made from scratch and delicious. My partner had oatmeal which seemed a little pricey at first. But when we saw the size and all the fresh add-ins (served on the side) we saw it was worth it. Even better, this wasn't 1 minute instant oats."}
{"text":"breakfast is my favorite meal! cracked egg is always so busy, and yet, they find you seats very quickly and the servers are always so joyful and give you quality time. they don't act rushed bit make you feel special and welcome. sweet potato skillet with bacon and apples was bomb!"}
{"text":"Living up to try and be the next 'Ahhnold' (an Asian one anyway) or Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson (I am known in many circles as 'The Pebble'), I do enjoy my breakfast.  And I love, love, love eggs!  It's the world's most complete animal protein.  Bodybuilders and Meatheads alike know...if you want more muscle, you must eat more protein!  I'm far from my early 20's when I used to add a raw egg or 2 to my daily whey protein & creatine shake, or eat 6 hard boiled eggs daily to help 'bulk up'...but I still love me some eggs early in the morning!  The Cracked Egg if you can't already tell is a breakfast-heavy joint.  They are usually only open daily for breakfast and lunch.  It's been voted 'The Best of Las Vegas' by the LVRJ at least 3 times.  So I figure instead of making my own breakfast we'd go check this place out.    The day we went it was packed!  Of course, it was a Sunday and church was probably just letting out.  There's a big hustle and bustle here, no shortage of orders being called out, waitstaff running around with plates, and the smell of fresh coffee being brewed.  Man, do I love the first meal of the day!  Yes, I am a morning person.  Night owls beware!  Menu is a good size and offers a ton of choices.  Now with The Cracked Egg being its namesake, please realize that most of their dishes require EGGS.  If you don't like eggs or egg products STEER CLEAR.  Should be obvious.  Go back to your overpriced lattes and friggin' scones.  Go dunk your donuts somewhere else.  Go back to your toaster to watch those tarts pop.  I feel sad for you folks.  The Cracked Egg has different parts to their menu.  There's \"Breanne's Basics\" which  have your plain eggs & bacon, eggs & sausage, and similar type stuff here.  In \"Eggs With Attitude\" these dishes are mostly various things scrambled with eggs, which they call a 'scramble'.  I much enjoy the Southwest Scramble which has 3 eggs scrambled with chorizo, green chiles, jalapenos, onion, jack & cheddar cheese, and a side of salsa.  \"The Benedicts\" is self-explanatory, a list of all their different Eggs Benedict concoctions.  Me?  I like the good ol' regular Eggs Benedict standard, done right.  In the \"Fluffy & Folded\" section you got your 3 egg omelettes, and my faves are The Denver with ham, bell peppers, onions, and cheese, or The Greek with spinach, tomatoes, and feta.  Yum!  \"Sin City Skillets\" are for you wannabe cowboys who like your food coming in a cast-iron skillet, build your own or choose one off of their menu.  The last big breakfast section is \"From the Griddle\" and includes their French toast choices as well as fresh pancakes.  From what I've tried and what I've heard...it's all pretty good stuff.    The Cracked Egg also has non-breakfast stuff for you non-breakfast eaters too.  From sandwiches and salads, to burgers and homemade chili, it's all there.  But why come to a breakfast joint and not have breakfast?  It's like going to El Pollo Loco and asking for fish!  Try the breakfast.  Only gripe I have here is that the prices are a bit on the high side.  I could make some of these dishes at home easily for half the cost, and do just as good a job since I love making breakfast anyway.  Two folks eating breakfast with a cup of joe each will probably set you back $25+ after tax and tip depending on what you eat.  Worth it if you go every once in a while or on a special occasion.  Or if you're loaded like Steve Wynn.  Geez, that guy is rich.  Stop by The Cracked Egg, have a hearty breakfast, then bench press that little Fiat in the parking lot!"}
{"text":"The wifey and I love getting breakfast on Sunday morning.  I don't know, something about it seems envigorating, like getting ready for the next week.  We in Las Vegas have no shortage of breakfast places to indulge at to carry on our day.  The Cracked Egg is located right off of Ann Road, right across the street from the nearby Yogurtland and Walgreens.  Real close to the Centennial area.  The Cracked Egg has been voted best of Las Vegas on three different years.  So yes, especially on a weekend the restaurant is bustling with patrons needing their morning cup of joe.  The kitchen is hopping, and the smell of bacon and eggs can be quite intoxicating to the senses.    The menu at The Cracked Egg is quite diverse, covering a whole realm of breakfast and lunch staples.  Lots of egg dishes (yeah you bodybuiding protein lovers), and lots of fresh ingredients.  You have scrambled egg dishes like the 'North Shore Scramble' which comes with bacon, tomatoes, onions, jack & cheddar cheese, and sour cream.  You have your Eggs Benedict plates, a common staple in most breakfast eateries.  There's breakfast choices like French Toast and pancakes on the ready.  You have your skillets like 'The Chili Skillet' which comes with chili, onions, and cheese.  Seems their big seller is omelettes which they call 'Fluffy & Folded', they crank a lot of these out of the kitchen.  That day we tried 'The Greek' which came with spinach, tomatoes, and feta cheese.  Most dishes come with either seasoned potatoes or hash browns (which I love well done), and your choice of toast or coffee cake.  In summary, the food is OK.  I mean the omelette was good, the hash browns were good, and the coffee cake was pretty darn tasty.  But I dunno, I just don't see paying around $9 for this.  In fact, a lot of the dishes just seemed a tad overpriced.  Call it the economy, call it inflation, it just seems damn expensive!  Maybe it's because I can see myself at home making a similar dish without much fuss.  I do like how the food looks mostly fresh, and appreciate the cooks since making an egg right is one of the hardest things to do.    The service was great, our waiter kept our coffee cups full and our water glasses topped off.  Even on this busy day, which in itself is a feat.  Nice guy, lots of energy, and good with holding multiple plates of food.  A necessary skill!  The Cracked Egg is also open for lunch, and that menu looked pretty good.  There's sandwiches like 'The Club' with turkey, ham, bacon, swiss, avocado, mayo, lettuce, and tomato on wheat.  Or salads like 'The Cobb' with chicken, bacon, ham, cheese, bleu cheese, avocado, hard boiled egg, tomatoes, and croutons.  I love me a club sandwich so this I may have to try if I ever go back.  They also have burgers too.  Same thing though, almost $10 for a lunch item is a bit high in my book for what you are getting.  They also have a new gluten free menu for those of you with this sensitivity.  That alone takes a lot of breakfast places out of the running, and having an entire menu for folks with gluten sensitivity probably helps ramp up business a bit.   I like The Cracked Egg but it's not one of the places I think of first when I want a hearty breakfast at a tiny price.  This place borders more on the gourmet side.  I'm happy as a clam with two scoops of hot rice, two eggs over easy, and two slices of SPAM!  So what do I know??"}
{"text":"Decent classic breakfast $6.99. English muffin cooked perfectly not burned, bacon was a little fatty for my tastes, eggs cooked to order and hash browns were tasty. No complaints friendly and courteous staff."}
{"text":"-coffee cake is baaaaging!  -massive protein -easily can eat clean here -way too many things to choose from (good thing)  -strong 4.5!"}
{"text":"4 1/2  stars  Aaaagh breakfast.  What a fantastic meal.  The trick is to eat it at about 11 so it spans 2 meal time frames.  Plus, at the cracked egg, you'll get enough for both!  Met a girlfriend for a nice Sunday morning chat with eggs.  Surprisingly, waited only 10 minutes!  She had the turkey sausage with scrambled eggs, potatoes, and chocolate chip coffee cake.  I didn't see much left when she was done....must have been delicious! Was $7.95 plus $3 for juice.  I had the chicken tenders with gravy, potatoes, eggs, and sourdough toast.  All the goodness you can possibly imagine on one plate. Mine was $12.95, plus $2 for coffee and tip = $18.  Kinda of pricey for breakfast, but I took half home.  The portion was ginormous!  The eggs were cooked perfectly.  The coffee was good and refilled.  Once again, no lattes, cappucino or espresso.  MEMO to all breakfast places: Get a freakin espresso machine! Then, you can charge $$$ for that sweet nectar of life! The potatoed were cripsy, which is good, but otherwise not very flavorful.  However, the mixed nicely wth all the gravy and gooey egg yolk on my plate.  Service was friendly and speedy.  A very satisfying breakfast!  They've got it right over here!"}
{"text":"This is our second time here and we will definitely keep coming back. The food is delicious and the serving sizes are great.!! The staff is upbeat and welcoming and the ambiance is warm, like you're at home :)"}
{"text":"Headed there this Sunday morning...Busy as usual.  We were told 15 min wait but it was more like 1/2 an hour.  This morning my hubby ordered the veggie skillet (seasoned potatoes, shrooms, broccoli, spinach & tomatoes , eggs) & added corned beef.  I had the California Omelette (avocado, bacon & jack cheese) with the skillet potatoes.    My omelette was fine.  The bacon inside was not cut up causing it to be a bit more difficult to bite into without taking half the bacon in a single bite!The potatoes were perfect-no grease what so ever! My hubby was pleased with his skillet but was slightly disappointed that it took forever to get his coffee (which is not worth the $2.00 price).   Given how busy the place was, service was good (even with the lag in coffee).  We also had an $8.00 coupon sent to us by that Cracked Egg making it a good deal.  Withoout the coupon I doubt we would make a special trip out there any time too soon."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years.  The food is consistently good. I've never had a dish here that I did not like. The wait staff is always friendly and service is on point. Some of them have been here for as long as I have been coming. That low turnover rate says a lot about the company! There is counter service, tables or booths to sit at.  Daily specials are hand written on a board and tempt me every time.  I love their coffee cake! Flavors change and range from blueberry, chocolate, strawberry and pumpkin in the fall.  Fresh brewed coffee and iced tea.  Homemade ranch It's great to dip anything in! The biggest problem I have when coming here is deciding to get breakfast or lunch. Their buffalo chicken finger salad is one of my favorites. It's like they knew I wanted chicken fingers and a side salad. So they put them together. The sandwiches are great too.  And breakfast, I have a handful of favorites. The cracked croissant is my go to when I'm too indecisive/hungry or just want a familiar classic. I always get the seasoned potatoes.  The portions are generous and worth the price."}
{"text":"We ordered our breakfast here for our bachelorette brunch, we just picked up our food and took it home. Ashley made it completely easy to order, we had ordered a tray of bacon, eggs,'potato, coffee cake, and it was priced at $9.95 per person. We had so many leftovers!!! Our food was ready on time, making the whole experience so smooth and easy. Definitely will recommend this as a catering option!"}
{"text":"The food was good, fair price. But after we were done eating, we stayed to finish our coffee and we kept getting dirty looks from the waitress."}
{"text":"The service has lacking today... Waited almost 10mins for our side order of ham... Even longer for our bill... Food was great as always though."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite breakfast place. We went there on a Saturday noon for brunch and had to wait for about minutes to get seated, which was totally worth the experience. This place seems to be very popular because all the seats were filled and everyone seemed to have a great time. The atmosphere is very casual and our server was super nice and attentive.   The menu is large and you will have many choices of sandwiches, omelets, and traditional american breakfasts. I had the green omelet with chicken, broccoli and some other green goodness, Salsa Verde on the side and my choice of seasoned potatoes and sour dough toast. The portions were big and I couldn't believe that I finished all of my food.    I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I guess it's all about location, location, location.  I've been to the Centennial location about 3 times and in those times, I thought that the food was just okay with less than average service.  This time and at the location near Summerlin, I had a different experience.  First of all, the service is completely different here.  From start to finish, I thought that the servers and check out was easy as can be.  As for the food, I decided on trying something different since I wasn't a huge fan of their skillets in the past.  This time I decided on their Cracked Croissant.  This is their breakfast sandwich that consist of a huge buttery croissant, eggs your way, choice of cheese, and choice of meat.  I had this with turkey bacon and let me tell you, this meal way to start the day.  My croissant was so big that I ate it with a knife and a fork (my favorite utensil).  The sandwich was buttery, tasty, and even had enough macros to satisfy my daily needs. Trust me...unsure of what to get here?  At $10.95 with hash browns, try their Cracked Croissant.    PS:  Only issue was with their hash browns.  I wanted it cooked extra crispy.  They dropped the ball on this one, but my croissant more than made up for it."}
{"text":"Every once in a while my boss will take us to breakfast and when he does, The Cracked Egg is where we usually go. It's simple but good breakfast foods, at a fair price.   On our last visit, I decided to create my own skillet. Skillets come with seasoned potatoes, two eggs, and various different toppings... I went with ham, cheese and mushrooms. It was served with a side of toast. Some places seem to dress these sort of skillet dishes with grease, but not here. It was great, plenty of all of the ingredients but not too much of anything...   We were served quickly and our drinks were never empty. Overall, a good place for your morning meal."}
{"text":"When I first heard of Cracked Egg, I immediately thought of another breakfast joint named Broken Yolk (San Diego, CA).  Breakfast at Broken Yolk is as good as it gets, but expensive, crazy busy and with long waits.  I expected the same here, but got the opposite. Wasn't busy for breakfast and food is decently priced.  However, another opposite is that the food was just okay, not great.  I expected Broken Yolk type servings and taste, but got more of IHOP/Denny's taste.  I'm not saying the food was horrible, it was just okay.    I had the Cheeseburger Meat Lover's Skillet.  Satisfying, but wasn't too far off from Denny's version.  Portion wasn't that big either, but not complaining about it since it wasn't over-priced.   Service was just average as well.  Seated right away, but it took a little time for our orders to get taken.  Remember, it wasn't busy.  Also a little disappointed that my water wasn't filled until after I was done eating.    Will I be back?  I might if I'm in the area.  Nothing wrong with the Cracked Egg in my opinion, just not what I expected.  Average price, average taste."}
{"text":"Wow. The size could be described as humongous! Lol. When the bisquet was placed in front of me I thought it might have been considered another entree it was so big. Biggest one I've ever seen.  I got the Pancho omlet with home fries. Delicious. The service was great and very friendly. The food also came quickly."}
{"text":"Best breakfast we had while in Vegas. Easy going atmosphere... staff were nice.  The service was fairly fast...  but.. the food was fantastic!   If you are looking for a very good breakfast at a reasonable cost... stop in and give them a try.   We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"As we first walked in, we were not greeted by the hostess. She should be one of the most friendliest people on the staff, but instead was dressed more comfortable than casual and never smiled. The food was good, especially the seasoned potatoes. Although, they forgot to bring out the bacon that I ordered along with the coffee cake. The food was a little overpriced but still enjoyed all of it. 3 stars for the food, this place lacked in quality customer service."}
{"text":"I had breakfast. Eggs and bacon. I would say this was average. A typical chain restaurant for breakfast. I got lunch to go of grilled chicken on a wrap. Not impressive."}
{"text":"This place is ok.. dont waste your time and money. Stay home and cook your own bfast it will probably taste better.. staff is nice but other than that.. i would not go back."}
{"text":"Coffee cake is a must!!!! Sooo good and warm omg. But anyways the food was amazing! Even my hot chocolate. The tap water is good too, Because I know at a lot of other places it isn't. Wait for the food was a little long but it's only because they were so busy. Will be coming back !(:"}
{"text":"Looking for a local breakfast joint landed us at the cracked egg. It was time to try something new and this was just the place. We were quickly greeted with a smile, followed by being seated shortly after. Once seated we got our drink orders and food orders in quickly.  As for the setting it was perfect for an early morning breakfast. Felt like a home cooked meal sort of place. I ordered eggs and sausage. It came with hash browns and toast, which was plenty of food to fill me up. The portions are fairly large in my opinion. On a side note, the hash browns were probably the best I've had in a long time. They were very flavorful with the perfect seasoning to complete the meal.  Overall the food was wonderful. It was fairly priced ans a good change to my typical Vegas cuisine. I recommend it to those looking for something new with the same foods, but with a great taste!"}
{"text":"Love the sweet potato skillet!!! So creative & delish I always get mine with egg whites!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast joints in town. As a local, I'm always looking for great places to show my friends visiting from out of town. Hands down this is one of my favorites!  I always get the basic breakfast with egg whites and turkey sausage.   The coffee cake is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"We come here all the time and love it. Great menu and consistently fresh and delicious. Every single time we've come here we've had excellent service, but our server today seems to be annoyed. Everyone has a bad day once in awhile right? It's forgivable. We will come back as long as we live there because it's simple food, great atmosphere, consistently awesome!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have recently discovered since our kids are now teenagers and sleep until noon, we can sneak out for breakfast and have some  \"us\" time!  The Cracked Egg is our new \"go to\" place.  If you're there before 8:30, then you have a good chance at no wait but after that, it starts to get busy.  I  have had many things on the menu but my favorite is the pork chili verde omelet.  It's got tender pork, cheese and a green chili sauce over the top and it's full of good flavor.  In addition, I have tried both potato options (hash browns or seasoned potatoes) and the seasoned potatoes are the choice of champions.  Overall, I have always had a good meal here and the wait staff is very nice and attentive, even when it gets busy.  However one thing I don't like is having to take my check up front to pay rather than dealing with it at the table.  Sometimes it's pretty crowded up front and the wait just to pay is the down side while if they took care of it at the table, I get to wait and chit chat with my company instead."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to breakfast places. Service has always been good although there is always a wait here because it can get really busy but totally worth the wait. I either order a GVP omelette or the cracked croissant so good! Tried many other things and have yet to complain."}
{"text":"Oh no, a breakfast place that doesn't know how to make an omelet?  For shame.  Oh no, a restaurant staff that doesn't care if you enjoyed your meal, even worse.  It's really too bad because the first time I went here the place was decent, it's why I decided to make a return trip, even though it's not technically in my 'hood.    I had the coffee cake again and though it is pretty good it's not good enough to have to throw the rest of the meal away.  I had the omelet with all the meats thrown in because it sounded awesome.  Good in theory with poor execution.  Instead of fluffy folded eggs it was basically cracked eggs with meat loaded into in and all scrambled up in a round shape.  You'd think it wouldn't matter but it was burnt and tasted just awful.    What was worse, when I went to pay and was asked how my meal was, I was honest.  I got a shrug and an ho hum, oh well.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Salsa is delicious. I got the Veggie Benny. It is the usual, just as expected. My boyfriend got the chicken fried steak, but he didn't really care for it. The coffee cake that came with his dish was warm! The service was great, they were happy and friendly. Food came out quick. :)"}
{"text":"I love that they have a gluten free menu.  The gf pancake is a nice rare splurge.  Beware! It's totally addictive.   Best part? Real whipped butter."}
{"text":"i stopped coming her because im not a fan. the servers all have attitudes and the food isnt the best."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a weekday and there was a line, so we thought this must be a nice restaurant. The waiters/ waitresses were friendly and polite. The food was pretty decent. I ordered the Homemade Corned Beef Hash which came with bell peppers, onions and 2 eggs, hash browns, and a toast. My friend ordered South Shore Scramble which came with 3 eggs scrambled with diced chicken, bacon, sliced avocado and swiss, a piece of coffee cake, and fruits. We ended up switching our main dishes ourselves because we like each other's better. I love the scrambled egg and the avocado the most. What is interesting is that the famous coffee cake in this restaurant isn't really a coffee cake as it doesn't have coffee flavor. So we asked the waiter to see if he accidentally served us a chocolate pound cake and he replied, \"it's only called a coffee cake,\" which cracked me up. Overall, I like the combination of their food."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmy. First time coming here and I am in love! I got the Huevos Rancheros chili verde with hash browns and it was delicious. Everything was cooked to perfection. I even got to try a bite of my friend's grilled cheese sandwich that had hash browns, green onions, bacon and of course the cheese. It was an amazing combination. I always hear  such good things about this place, now I know why. The service was amazing and found out she has been working there a long time. She was happy and sincere when she said she enjoys working there. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu and bring more people in. Great for breakfast and brunch!"}
{"text":"This place was so cute, loved the fast seating. Walked in on a Thursday and they sat us down instantly. Food was good, the eggs my friend ordered she wasn't  a fan of (scrambled) but she really loved the oatmeal. I loved the seasoned potatoes and the bacon egg sandwich. 4 stars because a small non refill OJ was $4.50 :/  I'll stick to water next time ;-)"}
{"text":"Please put the Snicker Doodle stuffed french toast on your regular menu ! IT was sooooo good and we tried to go back the follow week to have it again, only to find that it was the \"special\" for a short time."}
{"text":"I was actually pleasantly surprised by my experience here. I went to Egg Works when I first moved to the area and found that it reminded me of a glorified Denny's- minus the glory. I assumed this place would be just as generic but I was wrong! I ordered the spinach salad with the hot bacon dressing (I mean really, the dressing name alone could have sold me on it). The service was good but she definitely wanted to rush us out the door..I was headed to workout so I was staying to finish every bite! Sorry not sorry!"}
{"text":"Solid but slightly pricey. Lacks environment. Better than the big breakfast franchises (in Nevada anyway) as far as food. First time hit it home for me. Helpful and warm staff. I will visit many times I'm sure!"}
{"text":"You will get a solid breakfast here.  The service is fast and the selection is pretty good.  But it's just ok for us.  Nothing special, just a normal breakfast house.  Doesn't stand out and the environment is very cafeteria like.  It gets VERY loud in here, and you can hear every kid complaining about their meal.    If you are looking for a good meal with decent prices and you just need to fill your belly and go, this place will work fine for you.  If you want to enjoy your breakfast, speak with your significant other and just chill, don't bother.  We felt rushed and there was just way too much noise.  There is a patio outside in the strip mall.  I do not know if they will give you table service outdoors though.  We never asked, but if it's not too hot, that could be a good option to avoid the noise."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC. The coffee cake? To die for. The breakfast? Also to die for. Be careful, though, I'm not sure how many lives humans have. My Plutonian sisters and I have sacrificed many lives to this establishment, and we have no regrets about our decisions."}
{"text":"Today on 1/15/16 I had an urge both for blueberry pancakes and to change up things from the Grand Cafe experience at Red Rock. Based on Yelp research I chose The Cracked Egg because it has generated some good reviews and was very close to my hotel. My server, Tabitha greeted me with a smile and, very considerately, steered me to a larger table in the nearly empty restaurant. at 6:45 a.m., instead of compelling me to sit at a smaller table as many other places do. She provided the restaurant's extensive menu promptly and simultaneously took my order for coffee. The coffee was good and she diligently re-filled my cup until I cried uncle.I ordered two Blueberry Pancakes after she patiently explained that I had the option of ordering one, two or three, which the menu did not make evident.  The pancakes, unfortunately, tasted dry and leaden.They were not fluffy and light. They were hard to eat.They could not stand up to the excellent blueberry pancakes that I have had at Blueberry Hill restaurants during prior trips to Vegas. Perhaps the recipe can be tweaked because this is a family, and not a corporate, restaurant?  Prior to my leaving, Tabitha let me know where I could find some much needed cold medicine.It is the combination of her excellent service, the fact that my food experience diverged so much from the majority and the likelihood that I did not order the correct item that explains my decision to award an extra star.These factors would induce me to try The Cracked Egg again if I stay at Red Rock in the future."}
{"text":"Well if you read my stuff ya know I like my breakfast this place won't disappoint the portions are large and tasty, and they bring you coffee cake with your coffee??? Or toast but  give me cake any day! I had the carnitas omelet the taste was bangin, love Mexican food for breakfast the flavors start the day the only thing I didn't enjoy as I am impatient, was waiting I go to eat I'm hungry don't want to set for half an hour smelling food as I'm hungry already, right? But the staff was  pleasant and the price not to bad so, well be back"}
{"text":"This place is really delicious. Food is good and comes out relatively quickly. The coffee cake is really great because it's always different and I think it's homemade so always tastes fresh love that.   Okay so why 2 stars? Honestly the service is mediocre at best. Our actual server was very nice and friendly but the rest of the staff was very unprofessional. ***EVERYTIME*** we come in the staff is just sitting around eating and acting like it's their break room...I get it, you were busy and now you're hungry but you should keep some sort of professionalism. You're not closed yet so don't act like you are. \"Shit where are the bussers\" is what one guy said in response to most the booths needing to be bussed. We watched staff eating then handling fresh food without washing their hands. I'm in the industry... That is a basic guideline to not spreading your germs. I'm not looking for 5 star service but just some professionalism. One girl literally was spinning a coin on the counter the entire time and then dropping it on the floor over and over. It was really annoying...   I hope that they can tell the staff to act a little more professional so we don't have to feel like we are interrupting their break everytime we dine there. It ruins the experience and it's happened so many times I had to write something."}
{"text":"They one of the best crumbled eggs in vegas. Love their services!! Great environment and friendly staff. We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I love the Cracked Egg!  It is a great breakfast/lunch place that you NEED to check out!  The menu is fantastic here.  The breakfast side has all of your favorites, along with some more fun options to spice up your breakfast.  I think my favorite breakfast dish is the Cakes & Eggs combo.  Eggs any style, sausage/bacon, hash browns and pancakes.  Everything that makes breakfast wonderful in one serving.  YUM!  For brunch, you have got to get the Monte Cristo sandwich.  It is a ham, turkey, and cheese club made with French Toast!!!!  Yep, you heard me right, French Toast.  I absolutely love this sandwich.  The lunch menu is great as well.  My husbands dreams about the tuna melts, my daughter demands their chicken fingers, and I usually grab a burger.  So far, everything I have tried has been tasty and have not been disappointed one bit.  They also have a membership program that you can sign up for free.  Once you are in the system, they will send you an $8 off coupon every month.  The coupon has no rules except you have to come in, simple as that.  So sign up for the club and start getting coupons.  The club also gives you a $10 off check for every $250 you spend.  Don't you just love coupons?  With tons of variety so that everyone in your group can find something to eat, makes the Cracked Egg a great place to visit! The staff is always friendly and makes you feel welcome. Oh and the coffee cake is divine!  That is the trifecta of a great restaurant in my opinion.  Go check it out and be amazed."}
{"text":"Had brunch here this morning with my friend J and we enjoyed it.  But it wasn't anything amazing that makes me say we have to go back soon... It was very busy (11 a.m. on a Sunday so not surprising) and very noisy, we probably waited 20-25 minutes for a table.  It's pretty small inside too so there's lots of pushing past people and saying excuse me and all that.   In terms of breakfast/brunch places in Vegas, the Cracked Egg is better than Black Bear Diner but not as good as Hash House a Go Go.  Better than IHOP and much better than Pancake House.  Not as good as DW Bistro.  But both DW and Hash House are also more expensive.  We both had the Cakes & Eggs (with bacon) and it was good.  Nothing amazing but I enjoyed it and would go back again.  Reasonable price for about $12.  Service was adequate but again, nothing special.  She got us what we needed and that was about it.    One thing I didn't like - if you pay with a card and want to put the tip on the card, you have to tell the cashier how much you want to tip.  Makes me uncomfortable and I find it tacky.  Next time I'll bring some cash!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and each time is amazing. I like how the place reminds me of one of my favorite diners from back home and I feel so comfortable there! Staff is always amazing and making sure you are satisfied!"}
{"text":"So I give The Cracked Egg this rating on behalf of my husband. The reason being...     When my husband and I go to Las Vegas, we try to find food eating \"gems\" that are NOT on the strip. Last time we were there, my husband had wanted a Monte Cristo, and I read that they served one at the Luxor's Pyramid Cafe. We went and he found out it was actually a \"Monte Carlo\", not a \"Monte Cristo\".... (sadness on the part of my husband)...     This time, I did some research and found that there was a small chain called The Cracked Egg. We went to the one in Henderson and.... Bruce was in HEAVEN...  It was a REAL Monte Cristo The turkey, ham and swiss cheese dipped in a french toast batter and deep fried, (unlike the Monte Carlo, which is just grilled). I ordered the raspberry stuffed french toast, and was very satisfied. Very tasty and real fresh raspberries all over it too.     Not only were the portions huge... (we couldn't finish either order), but it was all perfectly cooked to our liking. I noticed other orders around us, and they also seemed like very generous helpings. The waiter, was very fast, efficient, but still very cordial.  I liked the fact that is is not just a breakfast house, which includes a \"gluten free\" menu,  but they have an extensive menu of sandwiches, burgers and salads.      Needless to say, when we visit Las Vegas again, we will definitely go to the Cracked Egg for our breakfast. Maybe try the other ones a bit closer to the middle of town."}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg is pretty much my favorite breakfast place in Vegas! I love this place for so many reasons that I probably can't mention them all in 1 review.  Not only do they offer unique breakfasts that no one else does, but it's always very fresh and tasty. The other thing that's really awesome about this place is that they pay attention to small details.   If your order something that comes with salsa they make sure to heat it up for you so your eggs/breakfast won't get cold. And when you order bread without butter they don't make the mistake of putting it on there.  Another thing that I absolutely love is that they offer Gluten free bread or muffins if you can't have gluten, which is the case for me.  And every time I've been here I've never had a problem with service. Every waitress is friendly, fast and efficient. They always go out of their way to make your experience super awesome.  I absolutely love it here and can't wait to eat breakfast here again when I'm back in town! A million thanks!!!  2 thumbs up for The Cracked Egg on West Cheyenne!"}
{"text":"I ordered the southwest scramble during 4th of July brunch and man it was busy! Food came out after 20 minutes which isn't too bad considering the holiday crowd. It was pretty standard breakfast with prompt service. I will be coming back to try something different."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were the first guests here on Sunday morning at 6am.  It was very cold but the waitress promised other guests who came later that it would heat up quickly as soon as the sun came up through all the windows.  My boyfriend ordered orange juice, bacon and eggs that came with coffee cake and hashed browns.  (You can also get toast or potatoes if you don't want coffee cake or hashed browns.)  I ordered a greek omelette with the same sides as my boyfriend and requested egg whites only.  I expected the waitress to give me a hard time about egg whites or tell me it'd be an extra charge but she did not!  Other places I have been to usually have at least charged me extra.  The waitress quickly brought me a coffee, my boyfriend his juice and also two piping hot coffee cakes.  I couldn't believe how delicious the coffee cake was!  It had an angel-food-cake texture with chocolate chips and cinnamon crumbles.  I was in heaven and weirdly had never had coffee cake before with coffee.  I felt like this is what senior citizens must feel like every morning and I liked it!  I guess I never really have coffee cake because I know it isn't healthy...  Later the waitress brought our meals, also pretty good.  She also refilled my coffee without me needing to ever ask her.  She was the only staff person I saw so she had the whole room that started to fill with golfers, though I knew there was a cook in the back somewhere.  Very casual spot.  You pay near the front door on your way out.  Two breakfasts was only around $25 with drinks and taxes (not including tip.)  I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place away from the busyness and generic food places on the strip. They had an excellent selection of gluten free food and I totally indulged in the fluffy GF pancakes. The steak and eggs included a good sized and perfectly cooked steak. I will definitely go back when I'm in town, it's a place worth driving out of your way to."}
{"text":"Love this place! Our favorite local breakfast spot and we were so happy when they opened this location in Summerlin. We are always greeted warmly and seated quickly. The service is fast and efficient and the food comes out quickly. Always order the coffee cake instead of toast! It's delicious and so light and moist and served warm.   I like the build your own breakfast skillet with the seasoned potatoes! I also like that they have vanilla creamers for my coffee :)   Always a great experience and the food is always amazing. In my opinion, it's a little on the pricy side for breakfast but everything is now a days."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very nice. The restaurant was clean and the service excellent.  Our breakfasts were good other than the potatoes which were extremely disappointing for this type of restaurant. They were the previously frozen cubed type."}
{"text":"The long line is worth the wait for this place! Other than a long wait for the food, the food itself is phenomenal! Definitely  give this place a go. Must try for breakfast food fans"}
{"text":"I gave this place five stars the first couple times we came here, but ever since the food has been hit or miss. Either your food comes out normal or it's burnt. Eggs, toast, breakfast potatoes. Given the last few times my eggs have come out too brown, I tried a waffle. Ten bucks for a single waffle and cup of fruit. I am used to places charging that much, but that typically includes sides like sausage, whipped cream, and toast and whatnot.  If food was more consistent, it'd be great, but until then, we will just stick with The Egg & I and Egg Works."}
{"text":"Decided to check out their Eggs Benedict this morning. Dreena was our server this morning, and she was great. She was attentive and very professional.   We always split a breakfast and get a side of some kind. So we ordered the Benedict, replacing the Canadian Bacon with regular bacon, and then decided on a coffee cake. We ordered coffee, and I like that there was regular cream as well as vanilla creamer already at the table. The coffee was really good. Nice and hot, and had good flavor.   Our coffee cake came out very quickly, and after about three bites of that our breakfast arrived. The coffee cake was very crumbly, but really flavorful. Nice vanilla flavor with a hint of lemon in the icing. The eggs Benedict was not a huge portion, actually rather small. Definitely not worthy of sharing like we typically do. Good to know, so next time we will actually get separate breakfasts. I like their use of green chiles throughout the menu, so we will be checking those out at some point.   We arrived at 9:30 Sunday, and the place was jamming. It was loud, but not bad. We felt rushed, even though our server made sure to tell us we were not to be in any hurry. But with our breakfast coming out in mere minutes, and the small portions we were done quickly. The line to pay was really long. That was just bad timing on our part. But the line wrapped along the wall, and in front of the kitchen where the servers all come and go with food. It was hectic. Not the greatest experience, but we will give it another try."}
{"text":"Stopped at this place on the way to hike Red Rock Canyon. It is a small place in a corner of a shopping mall. But the staff was super friendly and the breakfast I had was GREAT!  I would come back again and again. If you come this way, stop in and pick your favorite from their menu.   p.s. the lady next table ordered soup and it looked wonderful."}
{"text":"My family and I go here regularly. They are very consistent, staff is courteous and knowledgeable. They don't have an issue with substitutions, which allows you to tweak their menu items to your particular taste. I give them 5 stars because, while they are not perfect, I have never been disappointed. The food is very good, and I have never sent anything back."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. Got there just before they closed and the service was excellent. Food was even better. Had the Chicken Enchilada Omelet...de-li-shusss!!!"}
{"text":"I had the eggs benedict with seasoned potatoes and finish my breakfast with a coffee cake and everything was  amazing. The service was excellent. Daisy was my waitress, she is very nice and attentive. I discover a gem in Las Vegas. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I love breakfast.  My last meal on earth would definitely involve bacon.  I'm also cursed with Celiac Disease, which makes finding breakfast quite a difficult feat.  With this being said, I'm absolutely thrilled to have discovered The Cracked Egg on my yearly birthday trip to Vegas.    Don't be fooled by the cheesy stripmall-esque appearance of this restaurant.  'Tis a fine establishment.  If gluten is not a part of your life, you will love the gluten free pancakes that are served.  Since being diagnosed, I've had some gummy-ass, disgusting pancakes at other restaurants.  The Cracked Egg however serves up two huge gluten free pancakes.  Pair this with a banana topping, eggs and their crisp bacon and you've got a Full House!    Don't worry - you gluten eaters can enjoy a great selection of foody faire as well!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually on the West side, but this place was pretty good! Their Egg Benedict was well worth it!  -Clean place (& bathroom!) -Friendly staff -Good breakfast/brunch food"}
{"text":"First timer. Had the Monte Cristo. It was delicious! Service was fantastic. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times recently, consistently good food and good service. Today I tried the the Country Benedict and it was great. Whenever we are in the area looking for a good breakfast we return."}
{"text":"This was the best veggie Benedict that I have ever had. It actually had a whole avocado. The fruit was even good and the service was better"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed having breakfast at The Cracked Egg and I would absolutely recommend it for anyone looking for a nice place to enjoy a good breakfast!  I visited the location near Centennial Center but our waiter told us there was a total of 4 locations in Las Vegas and 1 in Henderson.    Positives 1) Menu was fantastic and had plenty of options to choose from.  Whether you want a basic breakfasts of eggs and meat with a side of hash-browns and toast or classic breakfast scrambles, omelettes, & skillets you are covered.  Don't miss out on the variations of French toast and pancakes either and of course you can also get eggs Benedict. 2) Service was exceptional!  Very friendly staff, greeted immediately upon entering and seated quickly.  Had my first cup of coffee as soon as we sat down and my cup was never empty. 3) Restaurant ambience was nice and comfortable!  Things to Know 1) This location was very intimate and seating inside the restaurant was limited so know if you pick a busy time the wait can be fairly lengthy.  They offer some outside seating as well.  Came back for a second visit around 10:00am on a Sunday and were told the wait was 45-60 minutes.  The food is definitely worth the wait but consider coming earlier; my first visit was around 7:30am and the place was busy but we sat immediately. 2) Parking at this location is limited mainly due to the size of the complex the restaurant is in."}
{"text":"I fail to understand why you can't get buttered gluten free toast... Even if you ask for it. Evidently, there's some sort of unspoken rule that says if you order gluten free toast as part of your breakfast, you don't want it buttered. Figured I was ahead of the game by requesting buttered, but maybe that is just too much to ask?"}
{"text":"Poor management here. We've been waiting an hour for a party of 13, while a they sat an incomplete party of 12 in front of us. Yes they arrived before us but there was only 3 of the 12 sitting and waiting for the other 8 to show up for more than 25 minutes. Probably won't return"}
{"text":"I am a regular patron of this restaurant and have been for years. I ordered two Cobb salads to go today and when I got home, I was disappointed. Normally, this restaurant serves nice sized portions and my salads will last me for four separate occasions. Neither salad was like that today, and when I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager, I was told he saw the salads being made and that \"from now on they will measure the lettuce\" to prevent this from happening again. I spent almost 30 dollars on 2 salads and the one time in years my order was not what it should have been, the manager brushes it off and even says he saw that his employee did not make sure the salads were up to standards. I am truly disappointed with the way this situation was handled and hope that this does not happen to another customer."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. I had the biscuits and gravy. Yumm. Biscuits are definitely scratch"}
{"text":"The food was okay but it wasn't all the hype that people talk about. But then again we might have ordered the wrong thing. Customer service was great over all."}
{"text":"It's ok. The service was, eh. The food was, eh. The place is clean and everything was just ok. I don't see what the fuss is. I wouldn't recommend it because I think there are plenty of other better breakfast places. Then again if I was close by and it was open I may eat there again. It's just...eh."}
{"text":"Very happy with this - exceeded expectations! Fresh fruit, large portions. Eggs were well prepared, server friendly. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Much like the Egg and I or Egg Works this place is a reliable spot for basic breakfast food... My only issue with these restaurants is there is nothing on their menus that differentiates them from every other breakfast spot... Pick a great dish, and do it better than everyone else... Well, until that happens, at least you know you they won't screw up your eggs and toast..."}
{"text":"Just moved to Vegas and I've been coming here for breakfast every morning for a week.  Great home style food!  Tried something new every morning and everything has been excellent."}
{"text":"I came here for the 1st time a couple months ago. I got the California benedict which I could barely stomach. It had spinach on it that was wilted and slimy. The hollandaise sauce also tasted weird. My husband liked his meal so I decided to give it another shot. We went back again last weekend and this time I ordered an omelette with cheddar cheese, green onions, mushrooms, and avocados. There was WAY too much cheese on it which made the omelette very oily. They also forgot the avocado and the eggs were an off color and didn't taste good. I really wanted to like this place but next time the hubby will have to go without me."}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best breakfast I've had in a restaurant.  The seasoned potatoes and raspberry French toast were incredible.  The orange juice is freshly squeezed and delicious.  As has been said, get the coffee cake.  Admittedly I've been there only once, but this is my first Yelp review, so consider that this is the first establishment that's prompted me to write one.  If I don't make it back, I must have gotten hit by a bus."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious! The chorizo was to die for, the portion size is enough for 2 people! The service and waitress were friendly and fast! We will be back really soon!"}
{"text":"This is our regular weekend breakfast joint. I really love the make your own skillets. Even if it weren't close to my house I think I would make the trip just for those seasoned potatoes! They are a must try."}
{"text":"This place was OK, the service was attentive and friendly but the food took a few minutes longer than breakfast and a sandwich should take. My sandwich wasn't any to write home about. The price is cheap so that's why I gave it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing. I get a piece of coffee cake to-go every time we eat here and it's never survived the drive home. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best places in Las Vegas/Henderson to eat breakfast (also serves lunch, closes at 3 pm). Entertainment Book coupon participant. This one is located in a large strip mall. We've eaten here before (but I don't remember what I ordered) with my FIL and his wife. But it was a while ago. We were seated within 10 minutes for getting our name on the waiting list. Last time, there was a much longer wait. My FIL said it was the slowest he'd ever seen (they were regulars).   Our drink order was pretty quick. Our server came up shortly afterward. We were talking a bit, and it seemed like the food came out pretty quickly too. My FIL got the Monte Cristo-turkey, ham and swiss dipped french toast batter and deep fried (never had one, but it looked interesting- my FIL enjoyed it, it's his favorite thing to order here), his wife got the Veggie Benny- sliced avocado, fresh spinach, grilled tomatoes and two poached eggs in hollandaise sauce (looked very generous, she only ate half), I got the Homemade Corned Beef Hash- I only made a dent in it (the biggest of the bunch, came with 2 eggs/scrambled, seasoned potatoes andfresh warm coffee cake- hash browns and toast are also options), and my husband got the Tori's Tortilla- large flour tortilla stuffed with scrambled eggs, chorizo, green chiles and onions topped with salsa, cheese, and sour cream; jalapenos omitted- he didn't finish it (breakfast type burrito, my hubby loves burritos). It was delicious. The corned beef wasn't fatty, and the peppers and onions were a nice combination, but there was also some hash potatoes underneath the eggs and over the corned beef. The seasoned potatoes were perfect, not mushy, not greasy, and firmly cooked, just the way like it. This was a big meal, so I ended up taking the rest home; I'm pregnant but if I overeat, I will not feel good. The service was very good, our server checked on us several times and got us refills.   Large portions, most breakfast items are $10.95 and under (maybe about 3 items are over that range). Good service. Great place for breakfast (in the same class as Omelet House and Jamms). Glanced at the Lunch menu, most items under are $10.95. 4 locations in the Las Vegas/Henderson area."}
{"text":"First time back since this was Fast Eddie's. Nice refreshed look but used to enjoy all the vintage signs. No complaints about the food or service. Raven waited on us. Great personality. Apologized that our food took a little longer than usual. English muffins were hot out of the toaster. Yeah! Looking forward to our next trip."}
{"text":"Overall I've never been amazed or totally satisfied, but it's not bad either.  A bit on the pricier side like the rest of the breakfast places.  It's not really vegan or vegetarian friendly.  They have one veggie croissant item.  The USA breakfast is super unhealthy xD  I can't say I recommend the place, but if you're dying for a bite and you're not particular about the items for your diet or health, maybe even a friend or two with ya, it's cool to stop by to eat and talk."}
{"text":"The buscuits are practically the size of your head!! Food is nothing to necessarily write home about, but good diner quailty for cheap. Good place to go with a hangover, they're portions are filling. Service was also great. The home fries could have been a little more crisp and hot, and real butter for the food would have been great, but those are my only minor complaints. Would reccomend for a cheap, quality, breakfast spot. :)"}
{"text":"4 Stars for breakfast, 1 Star for lunch.  Every choice that I have made for breakfast, thus far, have been GOOD. Their portions are HUGE. I can't eat very much in the AM so I end up sharing something with my other half. The omelets are good, salads are humongous, nothing on the Breakfast menu has disappointed. The nice thing about breakfast is that it comes with a choice of toast or coffee cake. I usually go with the toast because I LOVE coffee cake and I don't taste a drop of coffee in it.  Lunch wasn't as great. The portions are just as big enough to share. Flavor just wasn't there for me. I had the soup and salad and the hubs had  a sandwich. Everything lacked the flavor we were expecting.  Conclusion, we're only coming here for breakfast."}
{"text":"I was here twice during my last trip to Vegas.  The service is excellent! Their omelettes are all very good. I have tried some (including during other trips) and you can't go wrong with them."}
{"text":"I had the supposedly famous stuffed french toast w/bananas,peanut butter and it was something that my 10 year old kid brother could make. It was two slices of bread dabbled with like a crappy tasting peanut butter (Can peanut butter taste bad?) and some honey/bananas on side. Bread was dry and cheap. (Tasted like the generic bread from Kroger). The service was good but considering the breakfast was so poor it doesnt bring up the rating."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! It's a cute little diner style place and their breakfast is wonderful. They care about how you want your food! The service was great too.I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great service! Breakfast was tasty and you must try the coffee cake. Small local resturant with home feel."}
{"text":"When there's a huge line of people out the door of a restaurant you either get turned down by the wait or you get excited that it must be a really good place. Don't let the wait turn you away!! No matter how many people I see outside, I've never waited more than 20 minutes. The crowd also comes in swarms so you may see a line when you get there, 5 minutes later you'll be the only party waiting.  First of all order the coffee cake. Orders come with the option of toast or coffee cake and you should never choose toast. You can make that at home. The fresh baked sweet coffee cake with marmalade center, you just can't.  The portions here aren't too big, with Egg Works portions being bigger, but I think the quality is better. Also, the coffee cake is better.  The Cracked Egg is your average American local owned breakfast joint. You can't go wrong with them."}
{"text":"The Yelpers who have yelped before me got this review spot on. To keep it simple...  -The food is DELISH here. -The service is pretty bad.  We waited about 10-15 minutes after being seated to order or drinks.. not to GET our drinks, just to order them. Another 5 minutes later we finally got our drinks. When we needed refills it took a bit, had to wave at the server to get attention a few times. Takes a while for the food, but once you get it you forget about the service. Yum!  I ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich with hash browns and I was in heaven. People I was with got the Greek omelette and the Nutella filled french toast, both were pretty good, according to them.   I would definitely go back here, but because they are only open for breakfast/brunch there can be quite a rush. Next time I'll be sure to go earlier, maybe service will be better if the crowd is a little smaller."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast. I heard about the coffee cake and I did try it. It wasn't bad but nothing that would make you eat here just for that. Nice portions and friendly service. Big crowds on weekends not so much on weekdays."}
{"text":"The oatmeal is the most wonderful breakfast.  Comes with granola, fruit, brown sugar, raisins...the best!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and so far I have had a great experience.  Food is great especially the pumpkin coffee cake.  I brought my kids and they loved it.  It's not everywhere that you will find pb&j on the menu. Customer service was awesome as well.  There was one mistake but she fixed it really fast and with a smile.... Thank you everything about this cracked egg was awesome"}
{"text":"This is always our first pick for breakfast! Upsides? Coffee cake, efficient servers, and delicious eggs Benedict! Downsides? Always a wait esp. on Sunday. Maybe they need to expand, make better use of space, or let you reserve online. We live close so we could wait at home :-)"}
{"text":"I had the Carnitas omelet; salsa verde was very tasty, the carnitas meat was good when I could actually taste it through all the cheese and egg; good portion of food; huge helping of hash browns but more of a soggy consistency (almost like mashed potatoes) and I prefer my hash browns crispy; coffee cake was served warm and was really good  Slow start getting orders in but food came out really fast and service was great. Many breakfast options and seating inside the large restaurant and outside on the patio."}
{"text":"This is one of my alltime favorite breakfast joints. I don't know why. The food isn't that spectacular. I think its the creativity of the items and large menu selection that sticks me.   There's also two vegetarian items that are really good: The Veggie Benny (vegetarian eggs benedict) and the Veggie Croissant (with garlic mayo so good, make me wanna slap yo momma).   They're prices are a little steep, being a breakfast place in Summerlin. And they get totally hammered during prime breakfast hours, so I'd recommend going sub primetime. They have indoor and uncovered outdoor seating.   Get the coffee cake. The Kickin' Potatoes (their spunked-up version of potatas bravas) are supposed to be a signature item ... they a'ight.   * off the strip, non-casino"}
{"text":"The food is 5 stars. This location has an issue in the summer time with being unbarebly hot. Was an issue last year too. Has to be at least 85 degrees inside. Will be visiting another location until it is resolved."}
{"text":"It was really difficult for me to choose what I wanted from the menu, everything sounded so good!   I really enjoyed what I decided on, the croissant french toast. They didn't skimp out on the berries like most places do- they totally loaded it up! The coffee cake is also to die for.   My family (whom I went with) also all enjoyed their meals. Also, great service and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Today was our first visit to The Cracked Egg, but it won't be the last. Our waitress, Alleia, was amazing!! Her instincts with drink refills, meal timing, and clearing are all spot-on. The busing staff can almost clear tables faster than the hosting staff can seat people.   And the food.... So, so good! I highly recommend the skillets!  Curtis, the manager, has assembled a first rate team here! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot on the northwest side of town! Love there seasoned potatoes! Husband always gets different kinds of skillet and always loves them!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice now. The food is very tasty and the speed and quality of service is phenomenal. We've only been there on week days and while crowded we didn't have to wait to be seated. Everyone raves about the coffee cake. I can't say I was all that impressed. Perhaps it's because they heat it in a microwave before serving. I would have given them five stars if it wasn't for this and the prices being a bit high. All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"The food was good. Just the usual breakfast food. Nothing to special. I notice a lot of elderly people dine there. The environment was lifeless, and quiet. I felt like everyone can hear each other's conversations."}
{"text":"We love the Cracked Egg so much that I don't even want to post a favorable review and attract more customers to an already poppin location and make the wait longer than it already is!   But dang it, they're so good! They deserve all the Yelp Love.   This is the perfect spot to bring friends, family, a date, or to go by yourself to recover from a wild Vegas night. It's so cozy. The staff is super down to earth and professional. Not perfect but eager to be which is great. Their menu items vary from standard to unique - giving all the picky eaters something to choose from. I looove their Benedict's. My husband loves their omelets. And if they offer coffee cake - GET IT - bc ugh I dream about that fresh light fluffy amazing piece of heaven on a dish. It's so good, I momentarily lose my manners and (look what's over there?) fork up the last bite before my husband can claim it.   My only minor discomfort is that the wait can get long so we get in, get fed, and quickly pay up and leave so someone else can get seated. Hardly anything to cry about though.   If you're looking for charming local breakfast spot, this is it. You're gonna love it. You're going to come back for more."}
{"text":"Horrrible!! We went in for Father's day 15 minute wait,  got seated in the time frame got our drinks but then we sat there for 55 minutes barely a refill when we asked for it. Noone saying hey your food will be our shortly or any explanation for the long wait after waiting almost an hour we left.  The service was horrible place wasn't they clean. Staff wasn't very friendly   I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat breakfast! I get the same thing EVERY time! The country benny is amazing! Customer service is great, food & food options are great! Cannot complain."}
{"text":"Always liked this place before today but they were nasty when I tried to pay.  They have some sub-par counterfeit scanner and tried to refuse to let me pay. It's a real 10 dollar bill! DON'T REFUSE MY MONEY OR DEMAND I GO GET DIFFERENT CASH.  I looked up the scanner and the user manual states that if the money has been through the wash, if it has been crumpled or if it is dirty it will fail their scan yet they don't even have a starch pen as backup.   If you go here don't try to pay cash or they will give you trouble too."}
{"text":"Came for brunch. Was seated and served to fast. Felt pushy but I  Enjoyed the food. Portion was more than enough and the coffee was dark and delicious.  Overall decent experience."}
{"text":"Good food, had better thought. Prices on everything really high, not worth the amount of food you get. Thought I would try out this restaurant compared to egg works and the egg works is 10x better"}
{"text":"I ordered the Eggs Benedict and a side of coffee cake, and tried some of my sister's raspberry stuffed French toast. The eggs Benedict was good, the hollandaise sauce was a little too salty and thin, the hash browns were kinda soggy, but it wasn't bad. The coffee cake was delicious! Our server was also very attentive and kind!"}
{"text":"Food was so delicious! Very reasonable prices and everyone that helped us was very sweet and made sure we were taken care of . Definitely returning"}
{"text":"Came in here on a Friday morning with an old friend, got seated promptly - wow did this place fill up fast. Got the corned beef hash and some orange juice - everything turned out great. Even though the restaurant was almost at capacity, the food still came out promptly.  If I had to pick one disappointing thing about my visit, it would have been that my friend's coffee got refilled 4 times while we were there without him asking whereas I was never offered a refill or even a glass of water after I finished my shot glass sized orange juice.  Also - I wish they would handle your bill at your table, but I guess they'd rather us just bring it up. I thought this was a little annoying. A good experience nonetheless. I'll get a coffee next time."}
{"text":"Good food. For once plenty of butter for pancakes. Scrambled eggs could have been cooked just a hair longer.  Service was ok, not horrible lik the chain restaurants, which was refreshing. Place was very busy for a late Wednesday morning so it was very loud.  The only real negative was the prices, which skew high."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 if I could, but there's no option for it.  Upon entering this place, I did get more a crowded and intense fast paced feeling rather than a homey breakfast feeling.  The wait for a table was 5-10 mins which I thought was good, considering they were slammed with a bunch of families.    Once being seated I read the menu thoroughly, just so I would get something I liked rather than something I'd hate.  After a good 5 mins our waitress came out and gave us our drinks, she then returned later to take our order.  I thought that her knowledge about the food was a little less than pleasing.  I asked about the holladaise sauce and she didn't know hot describe it other than it was yellow. Hmmmm, I wasn't too please there so I ordered something I was familiar with.   Orders were:   Monte Cristo - Turkey, ham, cheese, and bread dipped in french toast batter and fried to a crisp.  It was very interesting, it came with syrup and 2 sides of either hash browns or seasoned potatoes and eggs.  Although the concept was interesting, I thought it was ok.  It was a weird combination and it did go together, but it's something I probably wouldn't try again.    Biscuits and Gravy - Biscuits served with gravy, the name says it all.  The biscuits were really soft and the consistency of it with the gravy did compliment each other well. Oddly though, I prefer the biscuits and gravy at South Point's Coronado Cafe.  Now that says a lot, especially since that's not voted Best of Las Vegas.  The gravy was ok, there were meats here in there, but it did taste a little watered down.    There were a lot of other things that I did want to try, but it didn't seem as interesting.  I'd probably return here cause the service was good, and the seating was fast."}
{"text":"I am Gluten intolerant, so eating out is very limiting. I was so pleased to see a note on Cracked Egg's dry erase board that said to ask about their gluten free options. I began to squeal and jump up and down when they handed me an ENTIRE gluten fee menu to choose from!!!  I got the garden omelet and it was delicious. They also offer gluten free pancakes!!   The only thing I hope they get in the future is gluten free bread so that I can enjoy some toast or one of their yummy sandwiches.  :) Thank you Cracked Egg!!!"}
{"text":"An insanely popular spot, even on weekdays. I like to order simple eggs Benedict but they have an avocado version that I thought I'd try. It was loaded with sauce and the eggs were poached for the least amount of time possible resulting in a soup Benedict. I also tried the fruit salad side and cottage cheese... Which included huge piecese of fruit and sprinkled paprika on the cheese... There was even paprika on the eggs..   I haven't been back and probably won't return."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place ever. Good service. I'd eat here every morning if I could. I like that they have an outdoor patio. And I love their breakfast skillets and lunches too!"}
{"text":"Very clean and friendly wait staff..got seated fast and very kids friendly..roomy and ample space for movement..food was good and fast..#howeber if you looking for white rice, you may need to bring a tupperware of your own....other than that very good place to eat...price is jus right for any #travelers with kiddos..."}
{"text":"Liz was our server and she was very attentive and sweet. She had very nice hair and she made our experience wonderful. My boyfriend ordered the ham and cheese omelette with potatoes toast and bacon. I ordered the better half with turkey sandwich and the chicken tortilla soup. Everything was cooked perfectly and delicious. The soup came in a bigger bowl than I thought. The soup was perfect. Everything was yummy here. Price is affordable as well. The decorations inside was cute and I loved everything about this place. Definitely recommend and will come back."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good. Always a wait and AC seems to not work properly if it is hot out. Staff is always great and kickin grilled cheese is the bomb."}
{"text":"TRUE breakfast lovers be advised: very ordinary food. Great atmosphere, very warm and attentive staff, and an extensive menu of skillets, omelettes, griddle dishes and benedicts. But sadly the food just doesn't carry. Sorry Cracked Egg, I'll be back, but with lowered expectations for food quality. A typical 3 star experience"}
{"text":"Its a nice and clean place the food is great. Service is even better very polite and attentive staff I will tell everyone that loves food to come here"}
{"text":"First time here, last stop before heading to the airport and I am MORE than content, the food was amazing! Honestly the best breakfast skillet I've ever had. I asked the server for a recommendation and she recommended exactly what I was debating on! I had the Country fried steak skillet and the coffee came it came with was also super delicious and freshly made, definitely definitely recommend this place to anyone passing through, arriving, leaving or even lives here but hasn't tried it lol I had Tabitha as my server and she made the experience that much better, will be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"I walked in around 10:55 . no one greeted me . Took about 10 minutes to be sat . Then waited another 6 minutes for the waiter. He was nice and helped me out , we got my whole order in one go. Food came out quick . I got the chicken fried steak with over easy eggs , home potatoes and the coffee cake . The coffee cake was pretty good ! I didn't have time to finish it before my food came out (I was playing on my phone) chicken fried steak and the gravy was really good! And my eggs were cooked to perfection! My waiter never came bye to ask how it was and if I needed refills, he also didn't clear my dirty plates throughout the whole visit. He brought my check and then finally asked if I needed a refill. Then I had to wait for 3 minutes at the host stand to pay for my meal! Luckily she was friendly and moved quickly  I would like to give a 4.5 but I can't . Better Service in certain areas would of made it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Smokey room egg stuffed pancakes lets just say stay away. The only good thing was the coffee and service but if you want good tasting food find the many other options in LV."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast, lunch spots in town. (at least that i've found) The only one I like better is...well I won't say.  But staff and food are always good.  Wish they had longer hours, that's my only complaint.  I'm a breakfast type of guy and this place hits the mark.  Huge selection even though I always get the same thing.  When I do get adventurous and try something new I'm rarely disappointed."}
{"text":"Before I start I want to apologize for not taking pictures of my food but I did take pictures of the establishment. I was hungry, very very very hungry. As soon as I got my meal I destroyed it literally killed that meal!  Now let's begin my story lol! I went to eat breakfast with my sister. I like this place because it doesn't hurt the pockets(not expensive) and the food is good! I call it a \"Hidden Gem\" a place most people pass by but probably should stop and try it out! I love that every time I go I'm greeted as soon as I walk-in with a \"hello\" or \" how can I help you\". That's great customer service I hate going to places and they don't greet you or are too busy to acknowledge your presence! So I give them A+ for that right off the bat. Theresa was our waitress and she was cool. She had small talk with us and then stated she would allow us to look at the menu first. The only knock I had about today's experience was that she left and came right back....... I wasn't ready *Kevin Hart Voice* so since my sister placed her order being greedy haha! I went ahead and placed mine but with a little more time I would have tried something else. So I decided to get the banana nut pancakes with scrambled egg whites and turkey sausage trying to \"keep it sexy\" aka healthy. The meal came out great.. my food was hot.. and didn't have to wait long. Now if I had more time I would have tried a omelette I have seen other guests get their omelettes and they look great!  Breakfast is usually busy but I have never had to wait long to be seated or greeted. Overall I like this place and will continue to go back and hopefully will try a omelette next time! No I will try that omelette *speak it into existence*"}
{"text":"This place has really good food. The Price is why its a 4 star though.  They have a great cobb salad!  Bacon and eggs are great with there home style potatoes.  I always take this to go!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place for breakfast or brunch! I usually always get their country fried steak and eggs..never disappointed. Its hot and fresh with a great country gravy and fried breakfast potatoes. Their omelets are also delicious. And with every entree order u xan get a coffee cake. Everyday the coffee cake is a different flavor..my favorite is the banana bread coffee cake."}
{"text":"I really can't come up with any complaints about The Cracked Egg. Every time I have eaten here I am impressed by both the food and the outstanding service.  This location gets really busy, but I've never waited more than 15 minutes. They are experts at getting people in and out as quickly as possible. The servers come by as soon as you are seated to take orders if you are ready, but they don't rush you if you aren't ready. The food comes out pretty quickly after ordering.   The menu is huge with a nice variety of breakfast options. As the name implies most of the options are geared toward eggs, but they also offer pancakes and waffles. The omelets are made with three eggs so they are huge. Skillets are also filling options. The coffee cake that comes with many of the meals is moist and sweet. I'd suggest adding a side of coffee cake if your meal doesn't already come with it. I love that there are many options with a Mexican twist including chorizo options."}
{"text":"With all the new breakfast  places popping up around the valley, this one will always be my favorite go to spot.  Always get the coffee cake different flavor everyday, great to start off with if you're  starving and waiting for the entrée.  Pancakes  are huge usually  you can split with another person.  Every breakfast  item is a hit, my only complaint is I wish you guys were open longer than 3pm."}
{"text":"My favorite French toast! I had their croissant French toast. It was piled high with fruits, and served with butter and syrup on the side. It had a crunchy bottom and wasn't too sweet. (Perfection) I also had their pesto scramble, which was also delicious."}
{"text":"The cracked egg is a staple for any breakfast lover who is living in or passing through Las Vegas. They have tons of egg scramble options, omelette options, pancakes, French toast, etc. The best part here is that they make the food promptly, the servers are really attentive, and the food is not only delicious but it is modestly priced.   Lucie's scramble is my suggestion but you pretty much can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"This place is probably great for a lot of people but I didn't care for it. I had the enchilada omelet and it had nasty American processed cheese on it I guess that's what they use for omelets and that probably doesn't bother most people but It makes me gag.. Ew on the menu it says jack cheese but it should add that it's processed. Anyways enough of the cheese rant. The service was good and the coffee cake was really good."}
{"text":"Very nice little breakfast/brunch place. Reminds me of Omelet House. Ordered the Cakes and Eggs breakfast, which came with banana & chocolate chip pancakes (extra surcharge), scrambled eggs, & bacon. Also ordered coffee, which was pretty standard.   Portions are pretty large, and it's a nice place to go to with a couple people or a large crowd. Parking seems plentiful too. Service was kinda whatevs, but our food came out pretty quick."}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg for breakfast was very good.  So since I cannot have real breakfast food like eggs and such I had the oatmeal. The Oatmeal was very good they had some fresh fruit,  raisins, brown sugar and granola on the side it made it very tasty , very filling.  My hubby had a meat omelet,  it was a huge omelette he said it was very tasty as well.  The wait was normal, 20 minutes, not bad.  Our waitress was very nice, she was from Oklahoma, loved her accent.  Very clean restaurant.  They had a sign that read something like this.... \" we do not have Wi-Fi, so  Dont ask, put your phone down and pretend it's 1995\" .   Gotta love it!"}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg is one of my favorite breakfast spots in Henderson.  This place gets busy! But the service here is always spot on.   COME HUNGRY!  There is no such thing as a \"light breakfast\" here.  Most entrees come with a side (seasoned potatoes or hash browns) and either coffee cake or toast.  The seasoned potatoes are delicious, nice and crispy with just the right amount of seasoning!  And always get the coffee cake!  They bring out the cake first and it's just the right amount of sweet to get you salivating for your meal.  It also pairs great with coffee.   Since I'm not huge on breakfast or heavy meals, I always get one of their vegetarian dishes.  Like I said, their portions are huge!  But with the vegetarian options, I'm able to finish up the plate with a few potatoes left over.   Veggie Benny - sliced avocado, fresh spinach, grilled tomatoes and two poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce.   The GVP scramble - comes with mushrooms, spinach, avocado & muenster cheese topped with sour cream.    I also love the feel of the restaurant. definitely has the old school vibe.  Also look around and read the signs! There's one that says something about putting down your phones & talk to each other like its 19?? (some year before cell phones)."}
{"text":"simple, casual breakfast joint near red rocks.  hearty portions. no frills. delicious.  glad i went there for breakfast rather than somewhere on the strip."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. First and last time coming here. Ate our food cold due to our server not being able to multitask. Even though our food got cold I can say it was good but not worth the drive here from Avondale. So if you don't mind horrible service and cold food this might be the place for you."}
{"text":"I wish I lived in Henderson.   OMG the Benedict Ole! The best benny ever. Get the home fries.  Everything here is good!"}
{"text":"I just ate TWO generations of chicken for breakfast...BOO-YAH! Worth the wait which is only about 20-30 on weekends.  Good, quick, BIG breakfastes."}
{"text":"Got horrible service. Two groups sat down after us and got served first. Our waitress helped other tables several times before checking on us while we're still waiting for our food. The food wasn't even that great. And when my daughter wanted to get a different drink, they charged us! First and last time my family eats here."}
{"text":"BEWARE OF TERRIBLY SLOW SERVICE.  I've been to cracked egg twice so far. the first time it was slow and the service was even slower. the 2nd time i went it was busier. and the service was still terribly slow. 1) never took our drink order. 2) went straight to food order cause of long wait. 2) forgot my coffee cake 3) forgot my to go box. 4) forgot my to go box. AGAIN. proceeding long wait. it is a bad sign when your waitress has to apologize to you every time she approaches the table. YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG.  side note: i did get the same waitress both visits.   had the PB stuff french toast. SUPER DUPER YUMMY IN MY TUMMY!! if you're looking for something sweet savory and all around goodness. this will hit the spot. its heavy so don't expect to be productive the rest of the bad. pair that with the coffee cake and its game over. nap time. i could only eat half.  also had the corn beef hash. quite good as well. i felt like they were filling the giant platter they brought me with potato though to use as a filler to cover up the plate. i didn't like the additional semi mashed potato added to my corned beef plus the additional side of potatoes/hash browns. that's a little potato overload.  okay. granted the terrible service might be due to a terrible waitress. it still put a damper on my experience. their lucky the food is good or i wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. I got the south beach scramble. It was good, just a little too much cheese for my liking. If you don't want a thick layer of cheese on top of your eggs, I suggest mentioning it to the server. We had to wait about 20 minutes on a Friday which seemed odd, but it wasn't too bad. My boyfriend got the north beach scramble and he really liked it."}
{"text":"Went this a.m. For breakfast . We were seated immediately .the 1 st thing you notice is that the room has a high open ceiling . It was very noisy . Our waitress was very sweet and immediately brought us coffee. And offered us a nice warm strawberry coffee cake very yummy  I had an omelette of spinach mushrooms & Munster cheese it was very good. Although a lot of melted cheese. Which our waitress noticed I was scrapping off. And asked if I would like another one without . I said it was fine just the way it was ! Coffee kept coming . My companion had the chili skillet and he enjoyed it . All in all good food and service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always love coming here! Prices are great, service is great, and the place has a nice family restaurant/diner feel that I love (Im from Connecticut so i'm used to small town diners). Today our servers name was Jose, he was really nice and not pushy like some servers could be! We got omelets, I had the greek replaced with cheddar, and a coffee cake (today it was a super yummy pumpkin flavor). My boyfriend was plain jane and got toast with his western omelet. (he soon wished he had gotten yummy coffee cake too!). Though it was pretty busy when we got there at 11ish, we only waited about 5 minutes to sit :)"}
{"text":"I was really craving eggs and i've never tried this place so i decided to give it a shot. I came in and ordered to go, took less than ten minutes. Food was good, and filling. $10 for an omelette with potatoes and a slice of coffee cake. Food wasn't super amazing but i liked it, and i mean how can you argue with a price like that? The only comment i have to make is the hostess, she wasn't friendly, didn't smile or say hello, she instantly said \"table for two?\" And started walking with menus before i could even answer and say i wanted to order to go. I work in food too, I'm a manager at my store, and i think having friendly service is one of the most important things a restaurant can have! Other than that, great breakfast place. I'll be coming back :)"}
{"text":"didn't have much of a wait around noon the day after Thanksgiving, but we had the sweetest waitress ever. i want to say the food was just okay, there was something about the hash browns that tasted a little off, like packaged? but again, service was great and the food was okay if you don't want to endure the waits at nearby egg-eries."}
{"text":"I've been here 4-5 times.   The eggs benedict in various styles are good. The coffee is good. I tried a Belgium waffle today. I wouldn't order it again. Strong vanilla flavor, but otherwise bland and the syrup is run of the mill artificial stuff. Basically it's an okay but not great diner. I haven't tried the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Mini vacation here in Vegas and heard this was good. The food was pretty good and the service was ok also. I'm big on tipping because I feel like there is a lot that goes into service, however, we had a OJ spill, was charged for it and the waiter didn't say anything but it appeared on the bill. There went the service and the tip. Don't surprise me with an extra charge for an accident, just say something. And yes, I would done here again."}
{"text":"So simple yet amazing. The staff there is super friendly and the food is so tasty and affordable. Very kid friendly. My family and I will most definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab breakfast. Reminds me of the Original Pancake house we have here in Cali.    Friends and I came here on a Saturday morning around 11 and waited about 25 min before getting seated which wasn't too bad (given all the people waiting outside).   Of course I went all out and ordered the: The Big Bad Wolf Omelette, Raspberry Cream Cheese French Toast, and went halfers with my buddy on the Kickin' Potatoes.  Everything tasted good but nothing stood out as whoa.."}
{"text":"Love the \"Taylor's Scramble\"!! Used to live in Henderson and would go almost every week and would always get the same thing. Now every time I'm in town, I have to go to Cracked Egg to get my scrambled egg + cream cheese fix! So happy they have so many locations now. The coffee cake always changes and am always curious to try it since the Taylor's Scramble comes with coffee cake or toast!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Their breakfasts are all really good! My favorite is the eggs Benedict with bacon instead of ham! It's a small restaurant & sometimes it can be a 20-30 minute wait on the weekends, but, it's worth it."}
{"text":"my go to bfast spot out in the Green Valley area.   They have  a good variety of items on the menu so anyone can find something here to eat.  They have real hashbrowns.  Do you know how hard it is to find simple straight forward hashbrowns now days.  Geesh.   From their scrambles to their omelets, pancakes, biscuits,  or basic breakfasts everything is on point.  Wish their coffee was better but oh well, guess you can't have it all.  Service is generally fast and courteous even when they're slammed."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because of the positive reviews I saw. And today i finally tried the place and was very disappointed. The food was mediocre. Service, horrifying. Staff is not very friendly. No eye contact. It just seemed like the staff did not want to be there. They have no pride in their restaurant either. There's trash on the floor and I watched the staff walk by it multiple times including the busser and no one seemed to care to pick it up. Additionally, our server seemed disinterested. She was not very genuine with her service. Made it a horrible experience especially when we are paying good money to buy cheap food. Pretty sure their food cost for French Toast is like 1 dollar and they charged it up to about 10 dollars. I gave it a two star because the food was OK."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. Very friendly waitress. Great place to have a quiet breakfast. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Love coming here and have a big breakfast.  Perfect for a morning breakfast after a night out or just a good way to start off a lazy day.  Service is good but not great, but hey, you should come for the good food not the service"}
{"text":"THis place is a BIG ZERO!!!!  I would have rated it less than one star but I didn't have that choice.  I looked this place up on the internet for breakfast.  Saw the reviews-- thought it was a good place to try.    I have a 2lb Chihuahua, which I tuck in my jacket.   In a nut shell, the waitress let me order, then told the other A***hole, I had my pet in my jacket and had to leave.   I would have left with no problem, but then the a***hole manger started making an issue that I had \"broke the law\" by bringing my pet with me.    I apologized, however, he followed me to the counter.  and again verbally attacked me.  So I begin to shout out loud.  He wanted the attention!!!.  Anyhow, if you're a pet lover, this place is a zero, the fat waitress is rude, \"yeah, you know who you are!!!  This whole incident could have been handled more professionally.  Certainly not PET freindly.  Don't go there!!!  Signed Animal lover."}
{"text":"Very good breakfasts are served here. Eggs are cooked to perfection. I especially like the home cooked corned beef hash. People are friendly. But service is somewhat slow."}
{"text":"Cracked Egg is one of my go to breakfast spots in Henderson. Big portion sizes, large variety of different breakfast and lunch foods, and good service. Almost always a wait on the weekends (15-20 minutes). Some of my favorites on the menu: South Shore Scramble, Oatmeal Overload, Homemade Corned Beef Hash, Peanut Butter Stuffed French Toast, Tuna Melt, Patty Melt."}
{"text":"Amazing food, and it comes out fast. Our waitress was so helpful with ordering for my keto diet. Rocking customer service!!"}
{"text":"I was going to leave one star but i like the food.   Went in this morning and it was busy as it is on a Sunday, went at 10:15 to start waiting for my family's 10:30 meet up time. Was told about 40 min. My husband was meeting us and he had to leave by 11:20 for work. We had 6 people in our group.      They started to seat tables fairly quickly so I went inside and asked how much longer and he said less than 40 minutes now because they're seating people so fast. I watch them seat three people at a table that could easily have fit 6. A few times they did this. Instead of just sitting in order you should look at the larger groups and make sure they're seated so they're not waiting over 45 minutes before being sat while EVERYONE else gets sat. I looked at the list several times and they skipped over us and kept seating people.     Eventually my husband just had to leave because he wasn't going to have time to eat (it was 10:54 and we hadn't been sat yet-I put my name in at 10:15) so we reduced our party to 5 people and I made sure we were sat the next tabIe. Ridiculous. I understand you're slammed on a Sunday morning but when you see that you have a table of six people and you just continue to sit 2 and 3 people at large tables that could accommodate a party of 6 it doesn't make much sense. The turnover for tables that can accommodate 2, 3 or 4 people(which was pretty much every group) was opening every 10 min or so.   So seat the large party of six first and then you can easily seat those other people quickly. It seemed like younger people running the front area who probably don't realize to do this and who don't care. We then waited 20 min or more for our food and watched everyone around us who sat after us getting their food first.   Not going to come back here this is the second bad experience with this location. Last time we we're completely ignored by our waitress she only came to take our order and give us our check. She helped every other table around us but ours for some reason she literally forgot about us and other people had to bring our food out and check on our drinks etc. we've been to this location many many many times, that will be the last time."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the customer service here. Especially this one waitress, I didn't get her name.  I ordered a veggie croissant sandwich and got fries with ranch. I didn't even know I could get fries (didn't say on the menu). The croissant sandwich tasted good. I was mostly in love with the fries. It had just enough crunch and flavor to it. Taste great with or without ranch.  I have ate here 3 times already. It's too bad this is only open til 2/3pm."}
{"text":"Great service, food is fabulous, location is convenient, restaurant is comfy.  Would recommend this place for anyone."}
{"text":"This is one of my first and favorite breakfast places to eat in Vegas. I was in the neighborhood so I decided to stop by.   I ordered my usual the Northshore Scramble which has tomatoes, grilled onions, bacon, Jack and Cheddar cheese, with sour cream on  top. It came with seasoned potatoes and I ordered avocado on the side. It was good as always especially on top of the buttered sourdough bread. The seasoned potatoes also had a good flavor and they were not salty.   My husband ordered a Tuna Salad sandwich with a side of fries. They accidentally gave him fresh fruit but when they found out their mistake they also gave him  his fries. I had a bite of the sandwich and the tuna was really good it had a \"zing\" to the taste.   I like the location of this Cracked Egg because it's inside a little mini food court that has a Starbucks, Subway, Gyro, and Pizza place. It has something for everyone just in case you are with people with different tastes you can all eat together in their outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"A good place for breakfast in the southwest part of town. Had the Corned beef hash w/eggs which is not on the menu but they serve it anyways and I've had their Club sandwich which was stacked high. I love the coffee cake they have instead of toast."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great portions! I had the pleasure of trying the Chile Verde dish with pork and eggs over easy.. Cheesy goodness!! Nice staff as well!!"}
{"text":"Great food - exceptional service. Just moved to Henderson from L.A. and this will be a destination breakfast spot for me and my friends. The Huevos Rancheros is great and you have to get the coffee cake. YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give it 4.5 stars, I would. I liked it much better than Egg and I in terms of atmosphere and food quality, but I reserve by 5 stars for the mind-blowing.  We did go on a weekend, so I knew there would be a wait -- and there was. It was a bit longer than the 10 minutes the hostess suggested -- almost 20, but we managed to get a seat and it wasn't a big deal.  I ordered eggs benedict, as I always do on my first run in a new breakfast spot and I wasn't disappointed. Of the places I've tried so far in Vegas, this was the best eggs benny I'd had... even better the Wynn's buffet.  The service was cordial, but not overly fussy. The coffee was good and even though we were seated by the bathroom/kitchen area, it wasn't really a bother. Someone's got to sit there, right?  Of the places I've been thus far, this would be my first choice when picking a breakfast spot. Looking forward to going back and trying some of their delicious-sounding omelettes."}
{"text":"I am not from Vegas.. been to Vegas about 1000 times and i can never get enough of this place!! i would eat breakfast here everyday if i could!!  They say a word of a great place travels far... i say its true!  Healthy creations if you are into the health kick or the good old traditional menu and great creative items. cant wait to come back!"}
{"text":"What is with the residents of Las Vegas? Do they actually LIKE to pay good money for a mediocre Breakfast?   On the menu...  Joe's Scramble (** $9.75) Three Eggs scrambled with seasoned Ground Beef, Spinach, Cream Cheese, Scallions, and Jack and Cheddar Cheese.  Before arriving here, I performed my due diligence and read the many positive reviews on Yelp, and how the Scrambles were described as \"HUGE\" (not my description...) or \"Hearty\".   I was really disappointed when I saw my \"Joe's Scramble\" heading towards me... The Scramble part of the meal only took up a third of the eight inch plate... the rest of the space taken up by what the restaurant described as Seasoned Potatoes... and, BTW, the portion of Potatoes were not HUGE, either.   I always felt that a restaurant should name an Entree what the primary flavor that the Diner would taste first... and in this particular case... it's the huge amount of Cheese that is layered over the Scramble. A LOT of Jack and Cheddar. This entree is a Cheese Scramble, for sure.  It would take a Forensic Scientist to even find the Ground Beef or the Spinach! And in this particular entree... I really felt that the meat was not all Ground Beef... Tasted like Beef and some other kind of meat.  The Country Potatoes (*** 1/2) was pretty good, but very small portions. Do you know how a Scrabble (the word game) Tile is shaped? That's the size of each chopped Potato with Seasoned Salt added during frying.  Coffee Cake (*** included with meal) Very sweet... But, I have to ask... When did a Coffee Cake have a Jelly Filling?  This really surprised me... never, ever had a Jelly filled Coffee Cake before.  Coffee (*** 1/2 $2.00) Unlimited re-fills.  And then... I received the Bill... Over $41... My mouth dropped in amazement! I looked at what I ordered... the two people that accompanied me (my youngest son and his future father-in-law) and what they ordered. With the tip included... this is as close to a $50 meal as you can get! And, take my word, this is NOT a $50 buck meal! No way, no how!  I asked my youngest, who ordered the Homemade Ground Beef Hash ($10.95) how he liked his Breakfast... He said the Mary Kitchen Hash found at Supermarkets was better than Hash in his meal (and, BTW, he's a Chef!). His comments are not part of the eventual rating...  The Future In-Law had The Cracked Croissant ($10.25)... No comments from that side of the family... I stated that the next time he would visit the \"Big Valley\", that I'd take him to some 5-Star Breakfast places vastly superior to the Cracked Egg... and some that served authentic Joe's Specials. For the rest of you... just search my reviews for Joe's Specials...  Apologies to present and future Family Members for dragging them here...  To aid this restaurant... here is a recipe for Joe's Special I researched on the Internet... notice how much MORE Beef there is... and the amount of Spinach... hint, hint..  Joe's Special  2T Olive or Vegetable Oil 2lb lean Ground Beef 2 medium Onions, finely chopped 2 Garlic Cloves, finely minced 1/2lb sliced mushrooms 1 1/4t Salt 1/4t ground Nutmeg 1/4t dry Oregano 1/4t Pepper 1/2lb Spinach, rinsed, stems removed, and leaves chopped (about 4 cups) 4-6 lg Eggs, lightly beaten  1 Heat oil in a wide frying pan over high heat. Crumble in beef and cook, stirring often, until browned. Drain excess fat. 2 Add onions, garlic and mushrooms; reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened, about 5 minutes. 3 Stir in salt, nutmeg, pepper, oregano and spinach; cook for about 5 more minutes. Add eggs. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, just until eggs are softly set.   Now... I ask you... doesn't this read good?"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place in Vegas. The coffee cake is a must! The flavor is different everyday.  The scramblers are awesome. My favorite is the sweet potato scramble. Large portions, don't be afraid to share with a friend.  Their coffee is excellent."}
{"text":"This really is a pretty good breakfast spot. Good service, good food. My husband loves their biscuits and gravy, so we come here at least a couple times a month."}
{"text":"Sunday family breakfast again! We always expect any restaurant to be busy around 10am on a Sunday but completely forgot that it's Valentine's Day and the wait times at almost every restaurant exceeded an hour. With two cranky babies in tow - not possible for us.  My mother-in-law found this place spur of the moment and they quoted us 15 minutes over the phone for a party of 6. Sweet! We got there within 5 minutes and put our name on the list and ended up waiting close to 35 minutes, again, it's a Sunday Hallmark holiday - no biggie.   Service was slow but she was super friendly and you could tell she was in the weeds. She was sweet to the kids and checked on us throughout our breakfast, she even refilled my coffee 4 times without me having to ask, extra caffeine means happy mommy. Cheers to her.   I strayed away from the traditional country fried steak and went with a Carnitas omelet - best choice of my day thus far. You also have the option of toast or homemade coffee cake...coffee cake = most amazing thing I've ever had in my life.  We'll definitely return and add this to our list of breakfast spots!"}
{"text":"COUNTRY FRIED STEAK SKILLET WITH COFFEE CAKE. This is all you need. The gravy is creamy, lots of cheesy goodness, potatoes seasoned so good and the fried steak? Crunchy, melt in your mouth AMAZING. The coffee cake changes from day to day but so far we haven't had a bad one. 5 stars all day"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! My parents want to come here every time they visit me. Great prices, good service, classic breakfast items. Can't really go wrong."}
{"text":"casual, country type place. good food, lots of egg options, friendly service. would return!"}
{"text":"Seriously always one of the best breakfast places ever. The food is never undercooked or cold. It's always delicious. The eggs Benedict is amazing.  Great service. Love this place."}
{"text":"This was the second time my parents and I tried this place. The first time the service was bad, we were ignored most of the time, and when we asked for something we were given attitude. After the meal I complained to the manger and he offered us two free breakfasts if we came back. So it's been 6 months and we decided to try again. Sad to say it wasn't any better. We were given a booth up front so I thought we would have more attention. Nope it's a thursday morning they were not busy, and my father and I only got a refill once on our coffee. We didn't even see the waitress until the food was delivered. The prices were high for the quality you got as well. Never going back to that location. If I'm going to pay that much I would rather go to JAMMS. At leaset you are taken care of and are met by friendly people."}
{"text":"This breaskfast place has the perfect diner feel. Family owned and you can tell the food is made with love. The portion of food is big and a great price. Everything was clean and tidy as well so thats something I personally enjoy. The food was great and came out in a timely manner. I ordered the california benidict and my tummy was jumping for joy. My friend ordered the cowboy skillet, and we both liked it alot! Im excited to come back and try more food. You'll leave full and happpy without breaking the wallet."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place only got four stars, the food is fantastic and the service is on point! Our waitress Kiara was friendly and knowledgable and quick! We loved her, the good would've brought us back but Kiara sealed the deal! Sorry if I spelled your name wrong young lady but you rocked! Thanks for an awesome experience! See you soon!"}
{"text":"I don't care what location you go to I have just 3 words: THE VEGGIE BENNY   Ok, ok one more word: PANCAKES   I've been to every location and used to go to the Cheyenne one every week when I first moved to Vegas 10 years ago. I care about nothing when I walk through those doors except the pancakes and the veggie benny. I don't care about poor service, unfilled water cups,a dirty table, mediocre other food items...Just give me the pancakes and the veggie benny and all is forgiven!"}
{"text":"In the mood for breakfast, this joint has decent reviews and was nearby.    The parking for this shopping center was packed but not discouraging.  I found a spot fairly easy, but would recommend keeping your eyes peeled for people popping around corners.  When I saw outdoor seating, I was so happy!  The young hostess asked how many and when I said just one, she asked if I wanted to just go to the counter.  I tolder I would rather not and asked if I may sit outside - WHOA! You would have thought I just insulted this girls mother because she got super rude and cold.  She coldly pushed through the door and put my stuff on the table.  I thanked her and NADA! Not a \"enjoy your meal, your server will be right with you, have a nice day\"...not even a flippin \"you, too.\" Or \" you're welcome.\"  This made me reluctant to even consider staying.  Fortunately the server outside was super friendly!  What a stark contrast. Super crappy hostess bit incredibly friendly waitress."}
{"text":"My breakfast go to place! Lots of tables, fast service & great breakfast & good coffee."}
{"text":"Walked in.  Took a quick glance.  Yup...we were the only Asian people there.  But that didn't stop me from trying to get my scrambled eggs, nor did the long wait and freezing weather outside.  Starting my morning with some coffee cake?  Count me in!  Starved and fatigue since the night before, this sweet beginning couldn't have come at a better time.    I knew I wanted some scrambled eggs but my rational mind opted for an omelette with vegetables, the Garden Patch.  It was a wrong choice as I was eyeing my friend's scrambled eggs the whole time.  Luckily I got to steal some and heavenly fluffy it was.  Don't get me wrong.  The Garden Patch omelette would have been a great hit if I were a rabbit.  Note to self - never put broccoli in an omelette.  Go for the hashbrown if you can.  If you get lucky, they'll brown it thoroughly and what you get will be a crunchy shreddy and starchy texture to play with in your mouth.  Definitely one of the funnest moments in my mouth."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast today. We live in california and are here for a couple of days. I got the skillet and added ground beef and bell peppers. It was one of the best skillets ive ever had. My boyfriend got the waffle and it was okay. The hostess at the front was a little grumpy which killed the mood a little BUT the skillet is what made me give 4 stars. I might be back tomorrow just to get that skillet one more time ;)"}
{"text":"Here we are all the way from the sands of Santa Cruz...Viva Las Vegas. The Cracked Egg I ordered the Southwest Scramble. mmmmm Meh! Burried in cheese with huge slices of jalapenos  onions and....I think its ground beef ...really not sure. Blandwest scramble. Had to try to remove the layer of artirial clogging cheese goo . More ketchup and salt no help. The is the whitest scramble Ive ever happened upon. Theres a missed opportunity here in the dusty Southwest. All I can find is dissapointment on a plate. Dont you worry one hoot though, Ill give you another chance."}
{"text":"So I finally find my favorite breakfast place and it happens to be in Henderson, NV... what luck.   We hit this delicious place up right before we left back to Phoenix and damn..  that's all I can say.  DAMN DELICIOUS!  You go inside this place that happens to be inside of a strip mall and right away it has that home cooked meal feel to it.  The friendly staff seats in a booth (which we always prefer) and we get the drink orders out of the way.  I love iced tea, but their tea wasn't the best. Trust me, Im not knocking down stars for that. lol.     As I look over the menu, I always find myself always getting the same type of food.. omelet or pancakes with some sides.  I decided to go out of the box and try something new.  Ready for this?  Peanut Butter Stuffed French Toast...     Yep..  I ordered that and let me tell you how amazing it was.  It was about six good sized slices that were filled with peanut butter and grilled to perfection, topped with bananas and honey, finished off with some hot maple syrup.  I was in breakfast heaven.    I could have easily split this meal up with someone and didn't finish it, but I highly recommend it.. especially if you love peanut butter!  i cant wait to get back to this place!"}
{"text":"Had brunch there today. I had a combo of French toast, eggs and bacon while my friend had a cheeseburger & fries. Overall, the French toast was delicious (thick Texas toast) as was the rest of my breakfast. Only con was I ordered wheat toast to come prior to my meal and never got the toast. As for my friend, she enjoyed the cheeseburger but mentioned the bun was a little hard/stale. Fries were good and the servers were attentive (minus the toast incident). Good options on the menu. I'd go there again for breakfast."}
{"text":"I finally tried the Cracked Egg yesterday as it is close by and we were starving.  Though it was a tad pricey for what I got, it was a re-creation of something I love at Magnolia Cafe in Austin, and it also had eggs.  I got the skillet, which is the seasoned potatoes, melted jack and cheddar cheese, and 2 eggs any style - then I get to add toppings.  The eggs - poached easy with perfectly runny yolks.  I got tomatillo sauce, scallions (not a choice but still got em), and avocado slices.  This combo just works, and it clogs the arteries too, but it is soooooo delicious.  I also tasted Eric R.'s coffee cake that came with his omelette - it was more like dessert but steaming hot, a welcome change from the cold cake slices at Starbucks.  Only confusing thing is when you walk in, there is a line for the cashier, but no hostess.  It took us awhile to find someone to seat us."}
{"text":"I was having a lot of work done on my car at Japanese Automotive. This restaurant was nearby, so this is our first time here and we loved it. I had the New Mexican omelet which they said would be smothered in green chile beef - and it was. This beefy, spicy sauce is one of the best restaurant-specific dishes I have had. They make it in-house and slow-roast it all day. I will probably only order dishes that include it when we return.  The service is excellent and the staff is attentive and very good at their jobs. Also, you get a lot of food for your money. They have their own blend of Guatamalen coffee, too."}
{"text":"There is no end to the amazing combinations you can have for breakfast here! The Peanut Butter filled French Toast and Carnitas Omlet are two that stand out to me. Oh, and you can't forget to have a piece of coffee cake as its always fresh and something seasonal. (Apple was the flavor this week... Pumpkin at Thanksgiving)  We like to take out of town friends here for breakfast or lunch depending on when we get up. Hash House is another go to, but this place is more local and isn't in the middle of a casino or across town. Just be prepared to wait as there always seems to be a bit of a line, but taste the food and you will know why."}
{"text":"A great home style breakfast. It's not life changing (strawberry pancakes @ Original Pancake House) but a great place to have a good meal and leave highly satisfied.   I would recommend this place to anyone in Vegas, but there are other killer choices that offer more unique favors so I can only give it a 3 of 5... Which is still damn good for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Gave the old woman my name thismorning and watched her write it down on list. Sat outside to wait because there was no room inside to sit or stand in the waiting area. Girlfriend went inside to see how long it would be and that we were outside. Old woman came out later saying nobody had put my name down. Left in disgust."}
{"text":"Don't even think about ordering To-Go.  Overall, this place is okay. Pretty standard breakfast stuff (awesome coffee cake) and pretty standard service.  The glaring failure with this place is their absolute inability to correctly put together a to go order.  I say inability, because there can't be any other explanation for their 100% failure rate. I can only assume that there is some kind of medical condition plaguing the staff that prohibits them from grasping the concept of checking an order before they hand it off.   I work in an office across from this place, and I have literally had this problem dozens of times. Every time I think, \"Ya know self, it's been awhile, maybe they have some new people in there now, maybe this time will be the time they don't suck\". Nope. I guess the real blame lies with me, because I know better and I still keep trying. My bad I guess."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in Vegas.  The coffee cake is ridiculously good!  The staff is usually very nice, the place is clean and well lit.  I've tried several things on the menu and have not been disappointed by any yet."}
{"text":"Nice little spot for breakfast . Was in town visiting family and needed to grab some food before we started exploring around the area for the day.  Service was good . The food was solid and filling.  And have no general complaints about the place .    If you're looking for some solid diner food and a breakfast that will put a smile on your face . This is the spot ."}
{"text":"I don't know if it is because I'm here hungry or what, but this place is delicious. A cute, unassuming spot that serves a stress free breakfast delight. I hope you are lucky enough to get Amanda. Note: Green Scramble"}
{"text":"Friendly Hostess and waitstaff was seated quickly and had a wonderful breakfast.  Had a bite of my husband's Jalapeño Bacon it has a spicy delicious kick to it!   South Shore Scramble accented with half of an avocado is  yummy !    Usually got to the Cracked Egg on Cheyenne but glad we went to this location today!"}
{"text":"First mistake was taking the table by the door!  The food is consistent but today's waiter was just adequate Because of the door being open and closed food became cold very quickly."}
{"text":"Best effing breakfast in town! The chili cheese skillet is ev-ry-thing! Relatively inexpensive! The best hostesses and waiters/waitresses around. Tends to be on the busy side on weekends, the brunch crowd can get a little hectic, so expect at least a 30 min wait, but it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast I've ever had. Hands down. The service is awesome, the food is delicious... what more can you ask for? I highly recommend the peanut butter french toast if you are a peanut butter lover! Also if you are a coffee cake fan, they bake a new flavor every day and every one I've had so far has been heavenly! (Oreo, blueberry, pumpkin chocolate chip!)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. Never had a problem until today. My boyfriend ordered the north shore scramble and I the Denver omelette (add avocado) half of the avocado was a brownish grey color which I ignored and pushed it to the side. About 5 minutes later after we've started eating, my boyfriend finds what looks like facial hair in his scrambled eggs. When we bring it up to the waitress she begins to argue with us on how she saw nothing. So my boyfriend picks it up with his fork and she says that it was just the cheese in the egg. I'm just curious.. since when are eggs and cheese black curly?"}
{"text":"We live near this location and have been here a number of times, as well as when it was Fast Eddie's. Typical diner, but great service, clean, good portions, and tasty food. My fiancé and I are regulars on the weekend when we don't feel like cooking or driving anywhere for a Sunday breakfast."}
{"text":"Not really sure why this place is so popular. My friends wanted to eat here after the AIDS walk. So of course, the first thing I do is check Yelp for some suggested dishes. Because everyone kept mentioning the coffee cake, I made sure to order something that came with that option.  I decided on the veggie skillet with over easy eggs. The first thing that came out was the coffee cake and I have to say, I am not a fan. The flavor was OK. I just didn't like the texture. Fortunately, the veggie skillet was good. It felt healthy and not at all greasy.  Overall, this place is A-OK. They didn't leave enough of an impression on me, but I'd come back if that's what the group wants."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever received. They simply care more about themselves than pleasing the customer.  We came to meet my mom and surprise her, we asked to have one of the several empty tables near my mom's table pulled next to her table and my mom's server refused, \"because it wasn't her section.\" Uh ok, whatever! So my husband and I just sit at a table next to my mom and wait and wait and wait for our server who never comes. I say to my husband, I think we need to let the hostess know since we just sat here. So I did and apologized for not making her aware of us taking the table and could she get our server.  The hostess was more than put out but I ignored it. Our server grudgingly showed up, took our order and disappeared, never to be heard from again until our food showed. I had two eggs over medium, they were fine except my food was served on a  warped plastic plate that kept spinning every time I ate off of it. My husband ordered basic eggs Benedict. The eggs were so under cooked that the whites looked literally like snot. So nasty. He pointed it out to the server and she proceeded to tell him that's how eggs Benedict are served and continued to argue with him even after he told her that was not true. The manager who came over was quite nice and apologetic and removed the EB from our bill with out hassle. It took forever to get our bill from the disgruntled server and when we finally did, it appeared that the EB had not been removed. I asked the previously rude hostess who is now our cashier to look into it and she proceeds to tell me that the reason we had such a bad experience was because we had sat ourselves. Well needless to say at this point, I'm offended beyond reason and I begin to lose it with the hostess. The manager comes again and is very nice again, but he clearly has no control over his staff. I NOR MY HUSBAND WILL EVER FREQUENT THIS ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN! The food is not worth the hassle and it's very over priced. I ended up paying $18 for two eggs, toast, hash browns, bacon,  and coffee. And as someone else that wrote a review stated the entire wait staff starting with the hostess are rude, unfriendly and act like they are doing you a favor. Stay away. I had been going there since the place opened and kept having bad experiences, which culminated into my last and final atrocious experience."}
{"text":"On a lazy Sunday morning you may see me and my family here.  We are regular Sunday Brunch patrons at The Cracked Egg.  We always come late Sunday morning, knowing there will be a Sunday wait and we are prepared.  We check in and then visit Popcorn Girl for a sample or two and walk through the pet store to see the latest gadgets (or just look at the same pet toys from the week before ...).  When we run out of things to do, we go back and wait for our name to be called while checking our Facebook or playing on our phones.  The time goes by quickly and we are seated in no time at all.  Our kids love the kids menus with crayons.  Since they already have their regular meals, they get to coloring while we choose between the sinfully delicious choices and the more sensible and healthy options.    BTW, when you are offered the choice of toast or coffee cake, try the coffee cake just once - YUM!  But don't think we are just Sunday visitors, we also come to this place for the occasional weekday breakfast or lunch.  We also often meet friends here for a much livelier meal.  This is Las Vegas' version of the local Sunday Brunch spot. Thank you Cracked Egg!"}
{"text":"Oh my! What an excellent breakfast . Great way to start our vacation with excellent service \" thank you Trisha \" The food was AMAZING! California eggs Benedict- heaven"}
{"text":"This place really is just so so. Service at 6:30 am is a bit slow & the pancakes had the most horrible consistency I've ever seen in a place. I didn't really see any huge portions from what I saw coming out of the kitchen. I had the basic cakes & eggs with sausage link. The best part of it was the link. Honestly Denny's would've been a better choice but there isn't one in my area. I'll come back ONLY if I can't make my own breakfast."}
{"text":"Can you say mehhhhh...? They took about 10 mins after we sat down to ask for our drink order ... We asked some guy if we can order and he said he's not our waiter. Wth? I don't like the service much and the food was alright. I got the eggs Benedict florentine style (added spinach) it was ok ... My friends said their food was ok too. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Awesome little breakfast stop. Great service, super fast. There's something on the menu for everyone. For someone that can't eat eggs, the menu is still great. The cobb salad is awesome."}
{"text":"I ordered the Traditional Eggs Benedict with home fries. Both were very tasty. My companion ordered the Spinach , Mushroom, Swiss Omlette with home fries as well. His Omlette was cooked very well. It was moist and looked delicious too. I would return but not very often because $40.00 for two meals, a coffee and a soda is a little pricey."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time, great food and atmosphere. Service is usually quite good even when they're busy. Join their rewards program for $8 off coupons in the mail, makes it more affordable!"}
{"text":"I would just like to say that the South Shore scramble is so tasty that it could honestly be up for an award.  They are always fast, friendly, and the food is always FRESH! The coffee cake flavors vary depending on the season... Fall of '09 they had Pumpkin Chocolate Chip, and I was in my third trimester.  Yes they were my best friend on a Sunday morning!    You really can't go wrong with anything you order here.  Just make sure you get there early on the weekends.  After about 9:30 you can't see the front door when you pull into the parking lot.  :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast food! I love that you can substitute for egg whites (even if there is an up charge!). I wish their hours were a bit extended since it's Vegas and people work all sorts of strange hours. It's definitely a homey-feel inside the restaurant and the choices for breakfast food is wide and varied. The service is just \"ok\" in my opinion and they seem happy within themselves, but not all that interested in their customers. I will definitely be back - the omelets are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! Tori's Tortilla is my favorite. The coffee cake changes everytime you go, but no matter the flavor, it always melts in your mouth! It is a must have. Get a peice and share, its big.  I recently moved away and I am going to miss this!"}
{"text":"If you are from out of town and need a tasty brunch place on the way to Red Rocks (or anywhere east of the strip) THIS IS YOUR SPOT! Easy to access from the main road, and only about 5-10 minutes from Red Rocks visitor center. Much more affordable than most breakfast places on the strip, and definitely a place for locals. Friendly service, tasty standard breakfast dishes (with veggie options) and BOMB coffee cake!"}
{"text":"This review is for the hosting staff only...  Ok, so every time we come out to Vegas to visit my brother we eat here at least once. Usually we have a little wait to sit down-5-10 mins most. We are a party of seven. I've been sitting here now for 30 minutes waiting for a table while they seat a party of eight that is not even all here yet.   Then they ask us if we can squeeze into a booth with a high chair on the end. A booth for four. And it is really not that busy in here.  Still waiting...almost 40 mins.  Be smart and don't hire stupid kids as hosts. And take off that stupid beanie. You're indoors for goodness sakes."}
{"text":"First time stopping in .. Love breakfast joints like this but sad to say that on my first experience here was not a joyous one, do to the lack of enthusiasm from customer service and the food at best ! Was mediocre .. I was stoked to try this place because of the reviews it has received and the pics of the food looked delish  .. Maybe just an off day .."}
{"text":"The coffee cake is so fresh and tender, it melts in your mouth. The pancakes are huge,light, and tender. I had a Greek omelet which was pretty good, but not light and fluffy. Same with the California omelet. Given the name f he restaurant, they should work on the omelet process to make them perfect. I would like to return and find other gems on the menu."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have gone here two times for Sunday breakfast and both times have loved our meal and our experience so much. I've ordered the country fried steak and gravy, no eggs, and with potatoes both times I've been and it's been amazingly delicious each time. I also ordered coffee cake both times and both flavors were not a disappointment at all. My boyfriend ordered the croissant sandwich and the Mexican skillet and enjoyed both, but wants the country fried steak and gravy next time we go. I definitely recommend it!  The prices are reasonable for the food you order and the portion sizes are decent. I've never left the restaurant still hungry or too full. We've had no problems as far as service goes with our waitresses being super friendly. There are lots of servers and staff walking around to check on tables and maintain a clean dining room. Both the indoor and the outdoor seating areas are nice to sit in. I recommend the outdoor seating only early in the morning when it's not too hot (this is Las Vegas after all). Also, just a side note, this place does get relatively busy in the morning for breakfast and brunch, so prepare for a short wait, even for the outdoor seating area usually. I expect there is about a 30-45 minute wait during peak hours, so around 10-11:30am."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast spot around. It's great good, even better prices. Since there is only one location that I know of and its a small location it can get busy and the wait time can be long if you get there at the wrong time but it definitely is worth it."}
{"text":"yummy coffee cakes!!! i wish they let you pick your own flavors though - since they bake them fresh, sizzling hot out of oven, you take your chances on what flavors of yours would be - we got cinnamon... which was really yummy anyways, but still... it would be nice if we get to choose?  food and services were both good, would come back if i am around town again!"}
{"text":"Great variety & service. I've only eaten here for breakfast but always a good experience. Would like to see more healthier options available."}
{"text":"The staff was exceptional,  very prompt with service,  and sitting us. The menu was delightful with all the different ways to have your eggs plus other items as well.  I will def try the churro french toast next time i come in."}
{"text":"This was a good breakfast place with an excellent menu.  The Green Scramble, which is scrambled eggs with chicken, broccoli, green chiles, spinach, and pepper topped with tons of jack cheese and served with Chile Verde on the side.  With good portions and a cool atmosphere I would come back if I was looking for breakfast."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Server was okay. NOW THE PROBLEM IS,  THE CASHIER/HOST.  When she was seating us, she didnt seem to care and was kinda rude. Whats worse is when we were closing our check.. She looked at us with eyebrows up and asked, \"how much tip you wanna put?!?\" Then when I told her I just wanted to write it sge replied, \"okay suite yourself\" and stared at the receipt WHILE I WRITE ON IT.   when we were about to walk out, didnt thank us at all or anything.  NEVER GOING BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN.   take my advice: go to egg works instead! They hate their jobs here."}
{"text":"Breakfast at its finest. I've been here a few times already and it's their coffee cake that keeps me coming back.   Usually with the breakfast meal, you get a choice of a coffee cake or toast. Coffee cake flavor changes daily. It comes out piping hot each time. I've had apple cinnmon, blueberry, and the latest one was the pumpkin nut coffee cake. It's so moist and sweet in every bite. Delicious. I wish i knew how to bake a coffee cake like these ones.   My usual order is some kind of skillet. The latest one i ordered was the country fried steak skillet. It consists of potatoes (which are seasoned perfectly to the point you don't even need ketchup or condiments for it) and then it has cut up pieces of the chicken fried steak, gravy and eggs. The eggs you can have any way you want. I always like mine scrambled.  Portions are generous as well. Remember to always eat just half of your coffee cake to save room for your meal. I sometimes get so caught up in the delicious coffee cake, I'm full by the time by meal comes.   All in all, great place for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"Cracked Egg is my favorite breakfast spot in Vegas. Their food is excellent. Their staff is really friendly and quick."}
{"text":"What a gem! We were visiting Las Vegas and staying off the strip, and I'm so glad our hotel valet recommended this place. Good food, great service, and cozy atmosphere - a definite 5 star experience!"}
{"text":"Well all was going well...until... the dreaded hair in my pancake! Ugh! There's just no recovering from that in my opinion. Sadly when I brought it to our server's attention she didn't appear shocked or surprised. It was more of a 'ugh...not again' kind of reaction. She removed it from our bill, but.... I'm done. Can't think of any reason that I'd be willing to eat here again. I'm giving them two stars because our party of seven was seated with nearly no wait and our service was really good. Our server was friendly and accommodating. The food take longer to come out than we thought it should considering they weren't packed the day we were there...and then it was all ruined by the hair. I'm still sick thinking of it!"}
{"text":"The breakfast is excellent. I'm eating the western omelette. It's worth every penny and the serving size is huge. If you have a big appetite or a small one, give the gem a chance...you won't regret it.   Also, service is pretty good...great waitress!"}
{"text":"Since I moved Vegas have heard about this place. Gave it try today. Was very disappointed. Place is overhyped, mediocre food. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"We ordered an omelette and it was good, it was a bit brown though. The prices for their sides are a little ridiculous, $1.50 for a side of sour cream."}
{"text":"I enjoy going to this breakfast lunch spot every so often. The coffee cake flavor usually? changes and it is always super moist and tasty. Service is friendly and it can get crowded towards lunch time. Great for families and groups."}
{"text":"Where do I even start? This place is home for me. The very first time I visited The Cracked Egg (their original location in the NW), I was in high school. Even with my vast change in taste (all around, but mostly food-wise) in the last decade, this is still my benchmark for breakfast, brunch, or lunch.  One thing that is consistent is my love for their Coffee Cake. It's a slice of fluffy goodness. Not to mention keeping you on your toes with unprecedented flavors! I ALWAYS order it with my breakfast. I've tried about ten of their flavors, but my favorites remain the pumpkin (obviously offered during Autumn) and the peanut butter (totally unexpected and simply amazing!). My goal has been to try all the flavors, so I get pretty excited when it's something I haven't had before. It's also the very first thing I ask the server, \"What flavor is the coffee cake today?\"  What I normally order for breakfast is the polish sausage, two sunny side-up eggs, and seasoned potatoes. The polish sausage is scrumptious, the eggs and potatoes are always cooked perfectly, and I love putting some Tabasco on my egg yolks, then dipping the potatoes in. YUM. Also, definitely some of the best \"breakfast\" potatoes! If I want to be healthy, I order The Garden Patch omelette that has fresh vegetables, made with egg whites.   For lunch, I'll order The Stuffed Avocado salad. A large bed of fresh lettuce, red onion, and tomatoes, and half an avocado stuffed with their housemade tuna salad. Ask for their house ranch dressing on the side and throw some black pepper on the salad, delicious.  Service is good and quick. They're always busy, but the food is quick to serve and tables are turned quickly as well. I also really like their Rewards Program. Not sure how long they've offered it, but I only learned about it about 8-10 months ago. I figured since I visit so often and always bring out-of-town visitors here, might as well participate and it has certainly paid off! Every month I receive a coupon flyer and earn rewards for every meal, so I have visited The Cracked Egg at least once or twice a month since I joined. Also, even with coupons accompanying almost every meal, I earned enough rewards to receive a $10 certificate in January!  If I'm looking for a quick, no-fuss, delicious breakfast, this is where I go, every time. It's definitely a favorite!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good breakfast. I was going to go to our usual morning grub spot (original house of pancakes) at Green Valley, but decided to try something new. I got an omlette and it came with a coffee cake. IT WAS AMAZING! BEST COFFEE CAKE EVERRRRR!! All warm and crumbly. So perfect. That set me up nicely for the omlette. The eggs were fluffy and the hash browns were nice, burnt and crispy, JUST like i requested them. Service was great. Didn't have to wait at all and just overall a good, non-touristy atmosphere. Lots of locals. Oh and very fair priced! Will be back again and recommend it to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday for the 1st time around 1030am. I was sceptical at first glance but our waitress Penny was very nice. It's smaller then it looks from the outside. Food was pretty good and affordable. But IHOPS, still will be my first choice."}
{"text":"Great food! It was not too busy on a Saturday morning, and the service was exceptional and we didn't have to wait for a table. Highly recommend the Irish Benedict and Cowboy Skillet."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend and she told me about her \"favorite breakfast place\" so I was excited to try it out. We were seated immediately and our drink orders were taken within minutes. When they returned with out drinks, we ordered breakfast. I ordered The Veggie Benny. Someone at my table ordered coffee cake and told me it was ridiculously delicious and yes it was, it was moist and just so good it should be illegal. The Veggie Benny was very tasty as well, I would highly recommend and definitely will return!"}
{"text":"We were on our way out of town and wanted to find a nice breakfast spot. We know some locals as they recommended this location. We had the coconut Macadamia Nut pancakes and the homemade hash. Sourdough Toast and house potatoes. Everything tasted pretty good and the service was alright.  Would definitely try it again to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't have much to say as I've been pretty boring the few times I went there and didn't order some of the more adventurous items.  However, it is a reliable breakfast spot and sometimes that's all you need to be.   Recently I had the chili omelette which was delicious and the other day I got the polish sausage and poached eggs.     Like I said, everything there is solid, no surprises and the service is always good.  Will always be my go-to, especially when some of the other trendy places in my neighborhood are on crazy waits."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast with okay service.   I had the cakes and eggs today. The eggs were a bit overcooked, the bacon was cooked perfectly, and the pancakes were a bit tough.   It took about 5-10 minutes to get served and the water refills weren't that speedy. I was never asked how my breakfast was until I was given the check."}
{"text":"I checked out this breakfast spot in a whim and wasn't disappointed. Great food, hot coffee and good customer service. I was seated quickly and ate at the counter. I will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! So very accommodating and allergy friendly. I had a skillet and it was unexpectedly very filling. The order was prompt and the wait time wasn't long. The customer service was wonderful. I'd definitely return when I'm there next."}
{"text":"Nice little find on the west side while visiting our kid at GCU. The service was outstanding. Eggs Benedict excellent and coffee good and hot. Nice break from the chains and a keeper."}
{"text":"stop what you're doing and go to the Cracked egg and try the Kickin Grilled Cheese!  frikken amazing!  I usually always go for breakfast but this time went for lunch and was NOT dissapointed.  Soooo bomb!!!!  Ashley was our server. Attentive, friendly and a great attitude! Thank you to everyone at the Cracked Egg!!!  you guys are all awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This was a really good experience!  I am always hesitant to dine at breakfast only establishments, but I will be back here!  The portions are huge and the prices reasonable!  Service is swift and friendly.  I know it is an easy way to fluff a review by going item by item to describe, in depth, everything we ordered but... it was all excellent!  Eggs, Chicken Fried Steak, potatoes, sausage, pancakes (this is the entire table, not just my meal!) - everything they brought was excellent!  Our server was swift and friendly, drinks were never empty, and we were out the door for 3 big meals, less than $30.  I will definitely be back.   My only knock is on my tip.  We asked to sit outside and in a huge, open patio, we are sat right next to two young gentlemen attempting to have a deep, personal discussion.  This was ackward for all involved.  It is impossible to zone out a conversation that is going on 4 feet away.  It was quite funny in retrospective, but a little common sense from the hostess would have been appreciated!"}
{"text":"The food here is great!!! Very fresh and hot. Nice size portions.  Service is good. It's a busy place and those ladies do a great job. I'm a repeat customer. Killer breakfast!!! Buy local!!!!"}
{"text":"Best whole in the wall for breakfast, the service can be a little better.. But the food makes up for it! And be prepared to wait it's worth the wait! I got the Mexican skillet and was so delicious.. My wife got there Belgium waffle and is her favorite now! Not pricey but Beyonce filled with Flavor!!!"}
{"text":"I intended on going to Stacks and Yolks this morning but drive by and it was super busy so I yelped this place and came here . I'm glad I did .  Pros- has a cool feel to it . Kinda like someone's kitchen. Big menu with lots of choices for all egg/juevos lovers. I literally finished all my  food! Which is rare for me lol  Our server \"Nancy\" was really sweet and patient because it took me a while to decide  Cons - I wish they has chicken and waffles but then again that's probably just the ABM (Angry Black Man) in me talking haha  Check them out ! If your in the Southwest area !"}
{"text":"If we lived in Henderson, I would be eating breakfast here every weekend!! Just happened upon this gem while searching for a drugstore. My husband LOVES eggs so he immediately said yes when I mentioned going here for breakfast. I had the peanut butter and banana french toast, it was amazing! The portion size of my meal was huge and well worth the price. My husband got the Monte Cristo, he loved it! If you are a local, I highly recommend checking this place out. I just discovered there is more than one location, so when we're in LV or Henderson again we will be eating here again for sure!"}
{"text":"Peanut Butter Stuffed French Toast is to die for! Love this place, wish we had one here in So Cal!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here and it was not too busy/packed as it was the first time. The first time I got the croissant French toast with a side of fries (the seasoning on the fries are PERFECT!) and this time I decided to try their Denver omelette without the onions. I chose to get it with a side of seasoned potatoes (which were just like the fries so I was SO happy) and a side of coffee cake.   I love that you can choose between a side of toast or coffee cake - most places you are charged extra if you want another side and most times I don't even want toast so I'm glad that this was an option. The coffee cake was perfectly warm, soft, and fluffy. I love it.   Whenever I get the chance I will come back here and try the other items on their menu. Service is great!"}
{"text":"No one working so we sat ourselves and it pissed of the waitress a little. Got 2 sandwiches 10-11$ each one word....meh!!  Philly steak was marginal and pastrami Reuben was just a ripoff little bit of pastrami, spot of cheese and invisible thousand island.  Basically \"drunk food\" , you know something to throw on your gut after hard night of drinking.  Their signature homemade coffee cake was a joke from a mix. Nope no little grandma making this cake.  Better food and price at McDs or strip joint."}
{"text":"When we walked in we were greeted by a hostess with the personality of a rock. The server was nice but the only time we saw her was when she took our order and gave us our food. If she had returned she would have known that the coffee cake she gave us was heated to the point that both my partner and I burned the tops of our mouths on it.   The food was OK, nothing to really write home about. I had their \"Homemade Corned Beef Hash\". As the stars describe it \"Meh, I've experienced better.\" I have actually had better food at the Cracked Egg up on Ann Rd. I think I'll stick to that one."}
{"text":"I like the selection, food is awesome. Front of the house could use some organization but I get it... It's packed! I like to sit at the counter but avoid Rosa the server... She lessens the experience here with her POOR SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Great food great service! Nice variety! I love the chicken fried steak and eggs with country sausage gravey!  My wife lives the strawberry cream cheese stuffed French Toast."}
{"text":"The Monte Cristo was the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had. Small town service and very good prices. Don't skip this place."}
{"text":"Breakfast that is spot on. Always go with the coffee cake, comes out warm and sweet. My boys love the pancakes.  Never remember the name of what I get but it's delicious with eggs and pesto. Yum!"}
{"text":"On our short visit to Vegas, this restaurant was recommended by a fellow hotel-stayer. Very pleased that we came! The food was excellent, and def. lived up to our expectations. We asked the waitress what she recommended on the menu- and we went with it! The green inlet was loaded w/ veggies- delish. Baked potato soup is great, and loaded with yummy cheese, scallions, and bacon. Okay... the STAR OF THE SHOW *drum roll* the red velvet coffee cake! My mouth is watering as I type this! Honestly, that could have been breakfast in-and-of-itself!"}
{"text":"Always take a seat at the bar because Caitlin is so sweet and nice! Food is really good. Can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. The breakfast potatoes weren't done all the way, my eggs were too runny."}
{"text":"Great place with great service. Our waitress was outstanding!  The cashier, an older woman, was a bit gruff but overall solid 4 star place.  Extensive gluten free menu and though I ordered off that menu they brought me the gluten version of the item. Thus be careful!  Again, the GF menu is quite impressive. Toast, pancakes and a ton of egg dishes.  We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Diana is awesome! She takes care of you. She's warm and friendly, making you feel right at home. I'd consider returning to this location in the future (I'm not close by) just because of her impeccable service.   I ordered the Taylor scramble and it was cooked perfectly. Good vibe at this location. Yassssss."}
{"text":"So the food was great and came out really fast. I got the skillet and was able to choose either coffe cake or toast. I got the coffee cake it was chocolate and so good. My friend got the peach coffee cake, she didn't like it as much as the chocolate.  There was 9 of us and it was pretty busy in there but our server Kiara was nice and got our food to us way faster than we expected, which was great cause we took a 6 am flight from Los Angeles and we were starving.  I would recommend this place. The food is extremely reasonably priced, all 9 of us ate for a little over a hundred bucks. You can't beat that, they also got us seated pretty fast for a party that size.  I will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I liked this place. Food was fresh, service was great. It is slightly higher than what I normally pay for eggs benedict but I also believe that you get what you pay for.  I had the Veggie Benny and it was awesome."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places in Vegas.   The food is great, service is quick and they have good coffee. A little speedy, but it's a trendy breakfast place so you have to expect that.   I love the sausage and any egg dish with that in it I'm happy. I always opt for the coffee cake which is making my mouth drool just thinking about that sweet goodness.   Coffee is great there and the staff keeps me full. I think even Mr. Pink would tip.   Great place, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hungry and wanting a good breakfast! A friend said that her family loves breakfast here, so I tagged along and tried the Cracked Egg.   We waited less than 10 minutes to be seated. I ordered denver omelette with wheat toast and crispy potatoes. Good thing I did not order drinks because our server rarely filled my friends' drinks. Our orders came a little longer than expected (side thoughts: maybe they're still harvesting our eggs, or maybe it's really a good breakfast!) I was quite disappointed. The egg of the omelette was dead dry, and the vegetables inside were sad and did not really came out with good flavors. I added chalula, salt, pepper, catsup, perhaps some tabasco, still was not a good omelette. My crispy potatoes were crispy, a little on the burned side. The toasts were thin, kinda falling apart if you dont take extra caution when putting jam. Hehe! I honestly think that our hospital cafeteria makes a better version of breakfast than Cracker Egg. Haha! Not a fan for sure!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!! The place seemed super busy when I got here but we were still able to get a spot to sit immediately. The service was quick and friendly and the food was amazing. I had the Monte Cristo - which was different from what I was used to because it was deep-fried. My taste buds: lovin' it, my diet: not so much.   The boy had an interesting egg-white scramble with tortilla strips and turkey which looked sloppy, but he liked it! Something really different about this breakfast joint is that you can pick between the standard toast or coffee cake - YUM!!  A super minute detail but I really enjoyed the essence of the fresh flowers. They had a bunch of items on the menu that I'm still dying to try so you can say its a place that is worth returning!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place for a while. Today I got that chance and this was so mediocre and blah I would have been better off going to McDonald's for a better value and not have to tip a waitress who reminded me of a robot. First off there was enough salt in this food to start my own Salton sea. My measure of how the rest of food is at a new restaurant is the Eggs Benedict so I always try that first...big pet peeve alert....why do restaurants insist on serving crappy powder mix hollandaise ..IT SUCKS.....is it so hard to put in some extra effort to make homemade sauce?..the seasoned potatoes tasted like they were put on a conveyor belt of salt and run thru like 20 times...i paid 2.45 for coffee..and 3.75 for an oj...total rip off..im tired of mediocre crap being pawned off on the public in order to keep the owners of these places from losing money. the waitress was going thru the motions dropped my check before i was even finished,did not ask if i wanted a warm up on my coffee nor a to go cup for my Starbucks costing java...The verdict is more crap service and food for 21 dollars..at least McDonald's is consistent....after i ate this garbage i had to find a bathroom quickly as I got an instant irritable bowel reaction...such a pleasant way to start the day....me thinks not!!"}
{"text":"I was not terribly impressed.  Long wait time.  Then when we received our seat we felt rushed along.  Husband's omelet was greasy and rather \"stiff\". I ordered peanut butter Stuffed French toast.  It was so dry and the egg batter on the outside was fried so hard it was like trying to chew rubbery silly putty."}
{"text":"The food was okay, I got the corn beef hash, the corn beef was a bit dry and so were the seasoned potatoes, but my eggs were perfect. The service was alright, I just wish the waitress was more talkative. Overall it's an alright restaurant."}
{"text":"usually they are always great. today my egg was over poached had to send it back for a redo. i will continue to go there."}
{"text":"heard nothing but great things about this place and had to try it out with my best gal pals. although, there was a groupon for this place not too long ago and totally regret not getting it now!  anyway, we went in on sunday morning around 930 or so. planned on breakfast before they all headed back to LA. it started off amazing! we got princess parking (aka parking right by the door)!!! we walked in and the place was almost full. luckily we got sat right away. shortly after we sat, the restaurant filled up, and by the time we ordered food they were on a wait. yey us!!!  service was awesome!!! food was amazing!!!  we ordered: chicken tenders, gravy and eggs pumpkin chocolate chip coffee cake banana chocolate chip veggie benedict corned beef hash  just a little heads up - corned beef hash isnt a traditional kinda corned beef hash. it was actually sliced corned beef  will definetely be back!"}
{"text":"Visited this morning for breakfast and were seated right away.  The service was excellent, but the food was fair.  My Big Bad Wolf omelet was actually tough, you almost had to cut the eggs with a knife.  The potatoes were well seasoned, but very dry.  My wife ordered ONE banana/walnut pancake, and she loved it.  Problem is; the dang thing cost $5.50 for a single, small pancake.  Overall, just average."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good customer service this is not the place. It starts at the front door by the sour expression on the hostess face and spreads through the restaurant to the servers. I watched one waitress deliver food to three tables snd not say a word to her customers.  Tory was our server and she was great."}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast instead of the usual breakfast spots. The service was friendly, but the food was not so fast coming to the tables. It is a popular restaurant with sometimes a wait. I will be returning soon to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place IS breakfast. There is no better spot in town, and every location is top-notch.  I've been going to the cracked egg for nearly ten years now. They opened their first location on Cheyenne and Buffalo and they've expanded to deliver amazing morning and lunch eats since.  Everything on the menu is good, but we always go for their skillets/scrambles. Every breakfast place has these now-standard items, but the Cracked Egg is the restaurant that by all others should be measured. Perfectly cut and crisped home fries make a salty, crunch bed for your custom or templated additions. I'm a fan of the SouthShore scramble. Cheese, chicken, bacon, and avocado? Yes please!  Always order their coffee cake as your side - enjoy the surprise of finding out what flavor you'll get. It changes daily."}
{"text":"I was slightly cranky when I arrived so being ignored for a good 10 minutes really got me peeved. I finally stopped a waitress that was flying around of I could just sit myself at the bar since I wasn't being seated. She explained the register runner was also to sit people, well that probably works fine if you don't have 4 groups waiting to cash out.  Anyways, after that frustration I had a wonderful breakfast. Good hash browns,with excellent eggs and I got to listen to the kitchen banter.  My coffee cup never even got close to empty which earns a nice big tip."}
{"text":"So the food here is excellent. Quite possibly the best coffee cake I've had outside of my mother's house. I only give it a 4-star because upon walking in the door the smell is not inviting as it should be. And the bathroom could use some attention. The service was adequate with no complaints and the food was great."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent coffee. Friendly staff. Homey aymosphere, good location, convenient to I17"}
{"text":"bumpin this place up to 4 stars since i always seem to come back here lol  this morning (more like noon) i had the la vaquera breakfast omelette. it has chorizo, salsa, green chiles, and it's topped with sour cream. it comes out looking like a pizza. it was very heavy (as expected) but realllly delicious!   i tried a bit of my friends chicken fried steak and it was delicious. i kinda wished i had ordered that instead!   so i figured out that the apple coffee cake is the one i like. you can always ask which type they have at the moment since it changes as diners order. the apple coffee cake was as warm and delicious as the first time i ever had it and i can't wait to go back and have it again."}
{"text":"Good service, the food was ok. A little better than IHOP. Nothing to write home about but it's a nice spot when you don't want to make breakfast."}
{"text":"1st time customers today- LOTS OF FOOD to choose from. We were seated right away, but had to wait alittle longer then usual for a waitress, but it being Memorial Day, we understand. I had the Eggs Benedict- pretty good but the hollandaise sauce fell alittle flat. My Hubby had an omelette, potatoes & Ham steak- not a peep from him translation 2thumbs up! Food was ready quickly n came out hot, waitress was ontop of coffee & drinks. All in all def a good Place to come to for breakfast/Lunch."}
{"text":"A reliable place for lunch or breakfast. This particular location lacks the grandma centric  charm of the other locations.  Food is great, but if you're looking for ceramic chickens, try the one on Rainbow."}
{"text":"Fairly disappointed. \"Homemade\" coffee cake was clearly boxed cake mix with raisins (?) on the bottom. Bacon was ice cold. Dense pancakes. Not worth it. Also why is everything on the menu in quotation marks?"}
{"text":"I think the food here is \"aiiight\". This is the nearest breakfast joint we have to our house. Besides, the hubby likes it here so I'm there if I like it or not. HAHA The pancakes and syrup are yummy though. The mr. always gets the pancakes. I, on the hand, try different items on the menu. Therefore, it's really a hit or miss with the \"non-breakfast\" items. I had the tuna melt it was OK. It was a little tart because there was a lot of relish in there. The Monte Cristo sandwich has got to be taken off the menu that was nasty! Kind of bummed about it cause I barely ate anything. Walked out with an empty stomach. I had the mushroom swiss burger and it was good, however, I noticed the patty was already cut in half. Who in the right mind cuts a burger patty in half and then serve it? I've always had the create your own skillet thingy. That was good BUT a little skimpy on some ingredients. All-in-all the food is mediocre. Not too shabby for a breakfast, brunch or lunch place."}
{"text":"My cousin in Vegas has taken me here a couple times when I was in town and the Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs is da bomb.  Super tasty breakfast dishes here.  Check it out the next time you're in the area."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and the service is always fast and friendly.  My favorite dish on the menu is the Sweet Potato Skillet.  It is really tasty and different.  Their oatmeal is also some of the best around!"}
{"text":"You know you're in trouble when your breakfast has a coffee cake appetizer.  Excellent food, very friendly staff.  Don't offer a military discount, hence four stars."}
{"text":"There are many menu items I favor.  The chile relleno omelet is my typical choice.  I order a side of avocado to make it \"perfect\" for me.  Staff is always courteous and attentive.  Atmosphere is active.  Decor is nice.  Sometimes there is a wait for seating but we've never had to wait more than about 15 minutes at most.  Food is consistently delicious.  This is a great family restaurant as they are ready, willing and able to accommodate with high chairs and roomy seating options.  Sometimes I find coupons and I think there is an app for 'rewards'.  If you sign in with Yelp you get a complimentary muffin!"}
{"text":"One of our fav places. Service is prompt. Eating outside on a nice day is perfect. Nice outdoor patio. Western omelet is my go to breakfast and hash browns are crisp and tender. Ask to have Ms DaAun be your server, she's awesome!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Service was terrible. Never came back after dropping off food. Never offered a refill on coffee or soda then when after 40 minutes came back with bill told us she was busy.  And walked away. Walked past our table next to the entry to food prep area at least 20 times. Never be back. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered the biscuits and gravy and was given some extremely dense hockey pucks with a white hash filled gravy like substance.  The \"famous\" potatoes were cold and season less.  That's $15 I wish I had back."}
{"text":"Went there this morning, post piano recital, so probably about 10:30. On a Saturday morning, you expect a wait at that hour. We waited, but briefly, and everyone was very nice. The food was delicious (especially the seasoned potatoes....flavorful and perfectly cooked! Not greasy or bland or overdone like at so many places!) and reasonably priced. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad, but it usually very busy and the food is inconsistent.  Sometimes it's great, other times I get mad.  Don't usually have customer service issues though, and they do try to be accommodating.  It's the hallmark of a mediocre food place when the quality of the food can vary that much depending on who is cooking that day.    I will go here if I need to, but don't actively go out of my way to eat here.  Don't get me wrong, when it's a good cook it's worth the wait and the money, I just hate the inconsistency."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast on the way out of town. I was starving and was kind of \"buffet-ed out.\"  We consulted Yelp and found The Cracked Egg.  This place serves large portions of good food, and everything comes with coffee cake...how can that be bad? Here is what we ordered:  Turkey sausage and eggs- My scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly and were light and fluffy. The turkey sausage appeared to be housemade and there were 3 generous medallions. I substituted cottage cheese for the potatoes without a problem.  Joe's scramble-This is basically everything but the kitchen sink held together by some eggs. Wow this was huge and delicious! It came with a gigantic portion of hash browns.  Breakfast came with peanut butter, chocolate chip coffee cake. The cake was warm and fluffy and gooey and sinful. Oh and did I mention big? Yeah, the pieces of coffee cake were massive!  The service was fast and friendly! This is a cute little place and we will definitely be back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Yum-O.  This is one of my fave breakfast spots.  It's always very busy so you usually have to wait, but it has never been for more than 15 minutes.  I took my goddaughter here on a very busy Saturday around noon and we waited for about 15 minutes.  They sat us in a booth and gave her a coloring sheet and some colored pencils to keep her occupied.  Whoever created the concept of coloring sheets at restaurants is a genius!!  Instant distraction for the wily children.  Thank you sir (or m'aam?).   My goddaughter is obsessed with noodles, and they didn't have any, much to her disappointment, but they did have a fun little kids menu so I ordered her a pb&j and some fries.  She loved her fries and did not touch the sandwich.  I ordered a half cobb salad with blue cheese dressing.  It was HUGE!  I think it needed more bacon and chicken because there was barely any on there and their blue cheese dressing tasted kind of plain.  If you're gonna splurge on calories and fat, you want some \"blow my mind\" blue cheese, right?  So yeah, I give the salad 3 stars.  I give this restaurant 4 stars though because I love their breakfast, and the service is always good.  I like the atmosphere, the feeling of being in a \"bustling\" diner."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere here on an early Sunday morning. My mom and I were in the area for a doctor's apptmt and finally decided to give this place a try. Went around 8am on a Sunday so it wasn't crowded at all, but I can imagine the lines forming as it gets later.   I got the build your own skillet with over medium eggs, bacon, mushrooms & spinach. It came with either toast or a coffee cake. The serving size was pretty big and I thought the skillet itself was delicious! The coffee cake also came out super warm! Mmmm yummy in my tummy.  My mom got the South Shore scrambled eggs with diced chicken, Swiss cheese & avocado with a side of hash browns and your choice of toast or coffee cake. This combo was perfect and avocado tasted SO good with everything else!!  This was a great experience & I'd definitely come back. Customer service was on point & our food came out within 10-15 mins tops tasting amazing!"}
{"text":"Nice place to get away from the strip and the temptation of a pricey breakfast buffet.  Our waiter was very pleasant and quickly brought our food out.  I had the cracked egg croissant, with choice of scrambled eggs over pepper jack and sausage.  Sadly and unexpectedly, it was the most bland thing ever."}
{"text":"The homemade coffee cake is amazing! Everything was fresh and cooked well! I ordered the croissant french toast with fruit and berries and it was incredible...even the blueberries were fresh! This will be our go to breakfast spot for sure!"}
{"text":"My fav breakfast spot!! Very clean, great servers, and even better food!! Person fav is the Monte Cristo and the potatoes are to die for!!"}
{"text":"Attentive,  fun server.  (Liz).  Southwest Scramble was good.  Coffee cake is amazing!"}
{"text":"Mediocre service, long wait for food after order, non friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food was great, I had the biscuits and gravy eggs benedict (forgot the name).  It was exactly the thing I've been looking for on a menu for years!  Staff was friendly and attentive (my coffee was never low) and the restaurant was clean.  I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great breakfast dishes and friendly and helpful servers. What more do you need in an egg restaurant?  I highly recommend the Veggie Eggs Benedict. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, Joes Scramble is a favorite. Best coffee in town. Yummy coffee cake.  Staff is super friendly, wait time is low."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was good. I have to say price wise it was a bit much but overall good experience."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for breakfast in Henderson! Management does a very good job and they've held on to several very efficient and friendly waitresses!  Ask for Indra, Cynthia or Dave and enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"We eat breakfast here fairly regularly.  My favorite is the Joe's scramble, a great egg dish with spinach, ground beef and cream cheese.  They serve potatoes similar to the ones at Egg Works/Egg and I, but I find the seasoning to be lacking at Cracked Egg.  So, I ask for extra seasoning on the side.  The chicken fried steak is VERY solid at this place.  Additionally, the specials are usually good, so check those out.  It's a large restaurant, so even during heavy traffic times the wait is usually not awful.  Also, kid friendly."}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here! Come for breakfast about once a week and its always amazing.  The service is great! Everyone is very friendly and the food is always spot on.  The spinach salad with warm bacon dressing is one of my favorite menu items!  and they make the best home fries!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast spot. The service and food are both wonderful, and we have rarely had to wait (we go early). We have never had a bad experience at this location."}
{"text":"Weekends are meant for indulging...and what better way than a ridiculously huge breakfast that will definitely clog your arteries?  A neighborhood favorite, there's definitely a wait if you want to score a table inside.  If you're willing to deal with the summer heat, there are plenty of tables outside and a mister that might help out a tad bit.  If your party is small enough, watch out for the counter because that's first come, first serve.  And you'll get first hand view of how this busy breakfast place keeps their food spitting out like fire!  The Big F was easily lured by the Chicken Fried Steak for $10.95.  It comes with two eggs, seasoned potatoes or hashed browns and a choice of toast or coffee cake.  A nice generous portion, he was definitely pleased with his order.  I went for the The Californian omelets for $9.95.  It comes with sliced bacon and jack cheese in the inside and sliced avocado on top.  It was definitely a generous portion, and I couldn't finish my order.  Looking around, the orders are HUGE here.  Salads are gigantic and definitely meant for sharing!  Sandwiches, burgers, and skillets are also on the menu.  I don't think many people really finish their brunch here because it's just that big!   The Cracked Egg is definitely doing something right because the masses do keep coming."}
{"text":"I usually go to The Omelette House and The Bagel Cafe for breakfast but this time I had to run errands around this area so I decided to come here this morning. I've been here before and have had good food but I ordered their Enchilada omelette this time. Never again. They took so long to bring out the food and with this particular omelette, I was so disappointed with the pepper jack cheese and the flavor overall. It was that nasty Wal-Mart Great Value cheese flavor. The breakfast potatoes were not bad though.  Also... This is unrelated but good luck with the music. They are playing Sunny 106.5 - non stop Christmas music in mid-November :P"}
{"text":"Frequent Rainbow location customer but this location is disorganized. Put my name down on waiting list, waited right outside for 20+ minutes when told 10 minutes max waiting time. Turns out my name was skipped when I told them I didn't mind the bar seats when any came up available. Many groups of customers came out while I sat outside waiting still no one checked up on me."}
{"text":"Customer service is good but always feeling rushed to finish my food on a week day afternoon when I'm just trying to relax.  & drink prices are little over priced, $3 for orange juice and they don't do any refills."}
{"text":"Great breakfast skillets and omelets! HUGE portions. Makes sense for the price. About $15 per person for breakfast if you get a coffee and a meal but you'll have leftovers! Friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Yes Please and THANK YOU!!!  Friendly service, reasonable prices, EXCELLENT BREAKFAST!!!!  Oh My... I so LOVE the Chile Verde Rancheros!!!  Their menu has a great variety and I keep wanting to try new things but I CRAVE this dish and cant seem to venture out yet.  A ceramic skillet of corn tortilla topped with Chile Verde, black beans, eggs and jack cheese topped with sour cream with a side of potato of your choice; hash browns or seasoned potatoes.  I normally prefer the seasoned potatoes but theirs arent all that fantastic.  I think their hash-browns are much better.  My hubby orders the Benedict Ole and swears by it!!  Whatever you choose to order, I am sure you will not be disappointed.  This place is usually full of people no matter what day of the week it is so that should say something!  Definitely my Saturday morning breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Food was a lil burnt. Got the eggs Benedict. The sauce was not great. Agree IHOP is better."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly servers and the eggs benedict is yummy! Also, they have great seasoned potatoes if you didn't want hashbrowns."}
{"text":"Was not impressed.  My coconut/macadamia pancakes were dry as a bone.  Literally.  They need to add whipped cream or something.  I also got their sweet potato fries...which were THE WORST i've ever eaten (dry, small portion, and almost inedible).  And how much were these sweet potato fries?  Seriously like 5 bucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My hubby got their eggs benedict platter, and he was also unimpressed.  So $40 later, you're left feeling ripped off and still hungry.  OH MY."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Vegas. Service always quick and friendly. The skillets are amazing. Lunch is great but its hard to skip breakfast."}
{"text":"OK food but nasty attitude from owner. As I was paying my bill I casually suggested they add Wi-Fi. The owner glared at me and said \"Why? Just so customers will sit around all day and never turn over the tables?\" Sorry, Cracked Egg, there are hundreds of places in Vegas where I can get a good breakfast without the attitude (and with Wi-Fi!)."}
{"text":"Best coffee ever!   Great menu selection, clean and bright. I had the Coconut Macadamia Pancakes, delicious, and WAY too much coffee!  The food is hot, servings are large, bathroom was spotless. The manager checked on me constantly! :)  I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"We always try to find the local hangouts because the food is always the best. We didn't miss with this place. Omelets were tasty and portions were generous. The biscuits and pepper gravy were HUGE but so delicious. We definitely recommend this place for all breakfast lovers."}
{"text":"Joes scramble with cream cheese is divine. Outstanding first class service. Wouldn't believe I was in a breakfast/lunch place. Really good quality to boot!"}
{"text":"This place this amazing! If you can get away from the Strip do so and come here for breakfast or lunch. The chicken fried steak was great and the cakes and eggs combo was good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  From the coffee cake to the way everything is cooked really well.  Is the food as good as a place like Bouchon at the Venetian?  No...but for the price it's as good as you'll get in Las Vegas.   The pancakes are nice and fluffy without the pasty feel and floury taste you get at other places.  French toast has a nice crispy outside and fluffy inside.  Omelettes and eggs are cooked really well.  Sausage and bacon are really flavorful...not just salty. If I didn't end up eating so much there I'd go more.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not a fan :( the food was average and the atmosphere and the staff didn't help much. The place felt like it was just a big efficiency machine instead of a nice intimate place to have a good breakfast with friends. I survived the breakfast but will not go back. I'm sure there are other places more to my taste..."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is on the acceptable side of average, but the service left something to be desired.   We treated our dear friend to breakfast at this restaurant of her choosing. The waitress was short with her and did not seem to care to listen to the way our guest wanted her eggs prepared. Excuse me, this place is called  the Cracked Egg. What's done with it after it's cracked is supposed to be up to the customer, hear?   It was a very tense and awkward moment. The dimwitted waitress brushed us off, and our friend had to raise her voice and repeat herself maybe three times. She also had to describe herself as the customer, lest the waitress not get it. It was appalling that it should have to be explained!  The food was mediocre but the employee's poor attitude really ruined the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came for the eggs Benedict for breakfast. I feel like every time I come there is a long wait for a table so I just sit at the bar. The food is good but nothing outstanding. I would like more flavor to the potatoes as they are kind of bland. Service is usually friendly and that's why I go back."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast good service, affordable prices, had the country benny, the eggs were cooked perferctly, and the potatoes were crispy and tasty."}
{"text":"So excited to have found another good breakfast spot while visiting family here in Arizona. We came really close to closing time and I hate being that person, but being pregnant, I was desperate for breakfast.  As soon as we walked in we received a warm welcome. I loved watching the interaction with staff, it's family owned and you can tell as they all treat each other like family, with love. Thank you Jenny for the outstanding service."}
{"text":"The Veggie Benny is to DIE for!! And the service? Best I've had in a very long time!!!"}
{"text":"Very happy! We happend to find The Cracked Egg on Yelp.  And might I say I am certainly happy and content there. Staff is very friendly and fast. On a Sunday which is today we were greeted and seated immediately. The menu is full of options for breakfast items. I ordered the California Eggs Benedict and I will be ordering that again when we return. My mate ordered the County Fried steak,  seemed to enjoy it alot, demolished the whole plate of food.  All in all we were happy to give this place a chance and we will be recommending The Cracked Eggs to our friends and colleagues"}
{"text":"Good fast service.  Good food while you're here.  Place was clean without crumbs on the floor.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast place that hit the spot! Went here with family for a quick bite before heading off to the airport and back to Htown. It was crowded with locals and that's always a great sign aside from the fact that my family brought me here, which is also a great sign since we're all foodies. I went with the Polish sausage and eggs with sourdough toast. Yummy! GO ALREADY for a great, neighborhood breakfast place."}
{"text":"Great experience, food and service. Overall a really good vibe from the restaurant. The hostess seated us quickly and was polite. The waitress attended us right away as well and always checked if we needed anything else. When the food arrived everything looked and smelled delicious. I ordered the 2 cakes, 2 pieces of bacon and eggs along with a has brown and literally stuffed my face! Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good breakfast place. I gave the four stars because it was good, but it is just a standard breakfast place. What is good about it though was the wait was short and the service and food are good. I would definitely recommend if you want a good breakfast quickly. My kids enjoyed their food and so did we. Next time we need a quick breakfast we will return."}
{"text":"The place was packed but my friends and I got bar seats as soon as we walked in (no waiting if you sit at the bar).  The coffee cake is amazing, light and not too sweet.  Oh, and warm like it just came out of the oven.  I got the veggie benedict and doused Cholula and ketchup on it.  There are a ton of choices on the menu and it can be overwhelming.  Just means I have to go back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"The southwest scramble, or any of their scrambles, will cure ANY hangover, and for a great price!!  Always consistent: good food, good service, good prices."}
{"text":"I'm starting to branch out and embrace the \"art\" of eating breakfast...lol.  Like many Americans, I find myself skipping the most important meal of the day, however, once in a while, breakfast is valid.  Today was one of those days.  My boss and I decided to have our meeting at The Cracked Egg, for a change of scenery.  AMBIANCE: The place is alright.  The decor is a little drab and boring.  There are booths and table tops, as well as a bar top to choose from.  I think it's kind of a lame attempt at a diner/breakfast nook-ish ambiance.  Hard to pin point, because nothing really comes together for me.  I do know, however, that it's very busy.  A lot of people seem to enjoy this place.  I'm guessing it's because of the food. LOL.  FOOD and SERVICE:  Today, I got the Eggs Benedict for $9.95.  The bread was kinda of soggy.  Although this entree is smothered with hollandaise, I've had a lot of benedicts to know the potential of the bottom bread.  The poached egg was cooked perfectly, the canadian bacon was thicker than what I'm used to, which is good.  The hollandaise was thicker than what I prefer.  My entree came with hash browns which was crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  The way it should be!  YUM!  All in all, my breakfast was a hit.  Here's where The Cracked Egg falls short for me.  Whenever I come into this restaurant, I always end up driving separately and meeting my party there.  If I'm the first person there, I'll get a table.  Although my entire party has not arrived yet, the server DOES NOT greet our table until all members of the party arrive.  This was the third occurence that I've noticed.  I think as courtesy, they should at least greet any member of the party, no matter what percentage is present.  I will say that they have employees taking beverage orders in the beginning which I appreciate.  Two instances though, including today, I needed to order right away so I could leave early and make a meeting at work.  That's where I see the benefit of the actual server coming by to greet whoever is there.  Please don't let my rant determine your decision to visit this place.  The food is actually good.  I appreciate the fact that they have healthy options like Garden Patch omelette, the lowfat scrambble, Lighten Up scrambble and an option to have fruit as your side instead of starch options.  Their menu is filled with lots of a great choices.  Please go in and try their coffee cakes.  They are to die for!"}
{"text":"Great service good food. You will enjoy this place. They have fabulous signs to read for your enjoyment."}
{"text":"This is superclose to our house and thought to give it a try after recommendations for the other locations.   Been a couple of times and definitely is my spot for a friendly brunch. The servers we've gotten the 3 times so far have been nice and kept up on our drinks throughout...nothing makes me more upset than having a mouthful of syrupy delight and zero to wash it down. I had full drink the whole time. Was busy but we got a table right away twice and once just a simple 5 minute wait while a table cleared. We go closer to when they close so we probably scrap by rush.   Now onto foods-  1st time Benedict Ole- YUMMY! Diced chicken and green chiles were a nice twist to this benedict and went really well all together. Probably my favorite non sweet dish so far.  Peanut Butter Stuffed French Toast- Really nice, served with bananas. Only downfall was it was very rich, but since my BF and I share dishes it broke up the richness so that we can enjoy more than a few bites.   2nd time Joes Scramble- beef, cream cheese, spinach, scallions, cheddar and jack cheese . Good and big portions, again I got a side of their potatoes included and I like em. Nicely fluffy eggs, not overcooked.  Daily Special on the whiteboard- Special K covered french toast with fresh fruit. This was yummy! I love cereal and french toast (I do Captain Crunch at home but rarely make- messy). This wasnt overwhelmingly sweet or rich than our last french toast, just right.  3rd time Montecristo- Turkey, Ham, cheese sandwich battered and fried. One of my guilty pleasure foods-  and they do it right here.  I guess everything is better deepfried like a twinkie, but here it was not soggy and served right away. Waffle with fruit- yummy and simple comfort.   UPDATE- 6/12/10 Got the Joe's Scramble (ground beef, spinach, cream cheese, melted cheese) this was simple and good, but not a favorite. Croissant French Toast- this was yummy, eggy, and buttery. It came with a nice spread of bananas, blueberries, blackberries, strawberries that were all very fresh.   Overall has been pleasing service and food so will come whenever we actually wake up early enough to have brunch on weekends. This is definitely a favorite breakfast spot....Yummy and I'm not that big on breakfast really.  UPDATE 10/24/10  Got the Ole Benedict. Still yummies. Still my favorite. Service is consistently very good and friendly. Quality breakfast is a real treat when you're a night person and today we woke up early enough to come before they close."}
{"text":"We walked in and immediately saw sparks coming out of the kitchen. The noise was so loud I could barely hear the hostess as she explained they were doing metal work/ construction in the kitchen. So all that metal work and construction is being done less than two feet from where food is being cooked. We left without eating.  Construction of any kind should not be done during business hours,  much less so close to food being ingested by customers."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times since being shown it about 8 or 9 years ago, maybe around 40 times give or take? It's been always a great breakfast spot. They are known for their coffee cake, which changes flavors often but never a bad choice. I also will note a fondness for their seasoned potatoes. It's small cubes of potatoes that are deep fried, then sprinkled with their seasoning mix. My best guess is that the mix includes salt, pepper, garlic and paprika. Always crispy and hot. During the busy times, there can be a wait to get a seat. And boy, does this place get busy! I often visit around opening, early in the morning, to avoid the big crowds. The place itself has a very casual and laid-back appearance. Prices are very reasonable. Friendly and attentive staff. Service has never been a problem yet. They are open for breakfast & lunch but I'm a fan of 'breakfast anytime' so I can't vouch for their lunch items. I've only had breakfast items here and only once came during lunch hour(ordered an omelet). I've brought alot of friends from out of town here when needing some early morning eats fresh from the airport. Great place for breakfast, I will keep coming here long as things don't change!"}
{"text":"Had to abandon our attempt for breakfast off the Las Vegas strip- if you go after 9am be prepared for long waits. This restaurant is in North Las Vegas but just a 15 -20 minute ride from the Strip depending which end you coming from.  Great decor and extra clean restaurant. Lately I have found restaurants with many decorations and fixtures do not dust appropriately! The menu is unique which I like a lot!   My husband had the monte cristo with hashbrowns and it met his expectations- and he has a pretty high bar. I had the bacon cheeseburger scramble with egg whites and it was delicious! The coffee cake was some kind of sinful pumpkin flavor and came out warm. Service was excellent- just enough attention but not annoying. Will go back again!  Well deserved Zagat ratings and Best of Las Vegas awards!"}
{"text":"Exactly what I was looking for in a breakfast place. I was looking to get away from the IHOP's and Denny's. This place exceeded my expectations. I ordered the Bacon Omelette with a side of seasoned potatoes. I think I'll be coming back just the seasoned potatoes! The food was delicious and came hot. Not like it was sitting under a warmer. The service was great! Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here right after a flight from Reno bright and early. Overall it was good.  My colleagues ordered their scramble with house potatoes and a spinach omelette, I went with a classic Denver omelette. Everyone enjoyed what they ordered but weren't blown away by any means.   The service was excellent as the waitress was very nice and the food came out super quick.   The price is kinda of high for what I would prefer, coming out to $15-16 not including tip, but if you're looking for a solid sit down breakfast place this a good spot."}
{"text":"Cracked Egg. No matter which location you land at, its always packed which only exemplifies how popular they are ... especially on weekends ... especially after a Friday night party we threw at the house .... especially after a hangover! Nothing a hearty breakfast wont tame.  i ordered the \"Big bad wolf\" ( named after me of course! ) and the mrs. ordered the country benny. One thing i noticed is that they charge more for a small cup of coffee here than a venti Starbucks. You can opt for either toast or hot coffee cake. I took the coffee cake of course.  No surprises with the food and the wait, even though they were very busy was only 10 minutes. The service here is A+. The food? A+.   Another added bonus is that its only minutes from the casa. If you make a habit of coming here every weekend, it will be a very expensive habit at $30 a pop.  After your meal, you wait in line at the reception - cashier area which gets congested because its right next to the entry with a constant flow of people. They should have you pay at the table."}
{"text":"Food is always good. Some of the servers, one female in particular with an engineers hat, are not very friendly. I'd note she is the worst because she is rude and makes us pause when we decide on where to eat. Usually the food wins out.  Anyway we like coming here aside from one or two waitresses."}
{"text":"Ok yelp said go and happily off I went. Missed my chicken fried steak so tried this place. Close, good price, super service all win win in Vegas. Def can recommend.  Mmmmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome breakfast place! I recomend having the Eggs benedict here.. I have gone here a couple of times and the service and the foods never fails me.. the wait may be a bit long.. i dont recall them taking reservations either.. But for a party of two i only waited for 5 minutes.. If your not in a rush and love a great atmosphere this place is Eggceptional!  For those who are own a strict diet you may choose to order egg whites with wheat bread, that's what i ordered when i was on a diet.. still a great meal! try now! it's located off of green valley parkway and pebble.."}
{"text":"Normally we have breakfast but the lunch option is just as good. The vegas style chicken sandwich was yummy. The service was great and we would visit again for lunch"}
{"text":"just left the restaurant...overpriced mediocre food and lackluster service...would not recommend and won't go back."}
{"text":"Great place to go, food was amazing! Firxt time here, food was hot and delicious. Waitress came all the time to refill coffee"}
{"text":"There were many wonderful gluten free options! Gluten free pancakes, and muffins and toast, and egg dishes were on the gf menu."}
{"text":"First time here with a friend of mine. He had recommend it to me. First off.. The coffee cake! Oh god it is a must have here. Its so fresh, warm, and full of flavor! I ordered the Monte Cristo. It French Toast stuffed with turkey ham and cheese. Let me tell you what a wonderful and delicious combo this makes. We also shared the Coconut Macadamia Pancakes. Those pancakes give this establishment five stars alone. The service was good I didn't get the young gals name. If I'm ever by this side of town I'll definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"Go with my daughter for breakfast at least once a week. Servers are super friendly, and the food is great. If you want a great breakfast with a down home atmosphere, this is the place! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and delicious.  Nice selection of skillet \"scrambles\".  Our service was great and our server, Laura, is by far the best."}
{"text":"Came here on my companions suggestion on Tuesday of this week. Was on holiday from Phoenix Arizona. Stayed at the blue moon. This was a drive but still worth it. I liked the coffee cake , however it needs a bit more density to be enjoyed. But I did enjoy it enough to give 4 stars. I ate the plain cheese omelet with seasoned potatoes. My companion had a thing with cream cheese combined with the eggs , i could say exactly but I forgot and if I had the menu in front of me I could tell you. Great place , great coffee , great service , I hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Food was excellent and cute atmosphere with creative signs"}
{"text":"I have visited The Cracked Egg several times and have waited a while to write a review.  This is mostly because this place is \"meh\" enough that I couldn't figure out what I thought about it.  Service is pretty poor.  One morning we brought my father here while he was in town for a visit.  We had to wait ten minutes for someone to even offer us a drink.  If Dad wasn't so hungry from his long plane ride, we would have left.  Even when we were finally served, the service left something to be desired.  My dish was cold and under-seasoned.    Some time later, I decided to give The Cracked Egg another try.  There are enough positive Yelp reviews that I thought maybe I just had an anomalous bad experience.  But the second time, it was even worse.  I asked to substitute egg whites in my skillet...when it came out with normal eggs and I asked to have it made correctly (very nicely, I might add), I received an audible groan in response.  The waitress acted as though it was a huge inconvenience for her to walk back to the kitchen.  The extra star is for the coffee cake, which my dad loved.  Other than that, I don't really see why I would visit The Cracked Egg when there are much better breakfast joints in town.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"great breakfast. you cant screw up eggs but you can pancakes and they were great. fast and easy."}
{"text":"Omlets are so yummu and the pumpkin cake"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!  My first time here will definitely make me think twice about going to Denny's or IHOP ever again.  It's a shame that I don't have a Cracked Egg near me.  The location definitely reminded me of a lil' mom n' pop restaraunt, with funny and quirky signs that will pull out a smile or two.    A lot of the meals waver above and below $10, but you definitely get what you pay for.  Hearty portions with the taste to match.  It was a nice trip away from the buffets on the strip for a nice brunch.  Our service for our big group was quick and friendly.  I will definitely be making a return visit!"}
{"text":"I love the area that the cracked egg is in it's really quiet and nice. I had the turkey sausage and scrambled eggs with the coffee cake and it was all very delicious. Will definitely be coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast spot on the weekends. Highly recommend the eggs benedict with seasoned potatoes and coffee! Service is quick and great."}
{"text":"Been here twice and I absolutely love it. I mean I love breakfast, but this place tops all breakfast places I've been to. It's a family run restaurant from what I've told and you will get one of the best services!! They constantly check up on you and really try to get you seated quick (because yes you will be waiting on the weekends around 10/11ish)!  I think I've gotten a variety of their dishes: scrambles, omelettes, and skillet. Of course I always get the coffee cake which either comes with original or a berry flavor.  The Coffee Cake is amazing. It seriously just melts in your mouth! It always comes out fresh and warm.  I also usually get seasoned potatoes over hash browns. Don't get me wrong. I love their hash browns, but I seriously love the seasoning and the cut size of the seasoned potatoes. So yes, definitely get this.  As for their scrambles, omelettes, and skillet.... the portions are HUGE. I can't even finish it and my fiance who eats a ton is full off one of their dishes. It's insane just how much they give you. It's so filling because it's all carbs. (: So you know you'll definitely get the bang for your buck. But all I can say is that everything on their menu is DELICIOUS. Comes out fresh and hot and packed with flavors.   I can't wait to go back to try more of their menu!! Getting so hungry thinking about it. Haha. They do have a lunch menu with sandwiches and stuff, but I think they serve breakfast all day."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for breakfast, I visit 3x or more monthly...so let me explain the 4 stars.  The food here is excellent! The menu has just the right amount of options, something to please everyone. What I like best is on my fat days I can come and pig out and when I am being good I can eat healthy and love my meal just as much. This is a rare feat for a restaurant. Servers here are great, never have I had bad service. This place also sends me discounts in the mail which I love. I also love the little details of this place, fresh flowers & I love the sign about the unattended children. AWESOME.  The place is consistent that is for sure. However, with that said it is consistent in the ways it excels and also lacks. The reason for the 4 stars comes down to two things, the terrible hostesses and the coffee. The hostesses here are terrible. I don't think once ever in the 100 times I have visited has one of them ever smiled. It's a shame really. This place would get shoot 6 stars if they changed the coffee and got some smiley people greeters!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. Healthy options, great food and nice outdoor patio. Friendly staff.  I will definitely come back again. Only bad thing for me was few soup options."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times. My latest visit was just this morning at the crack of dawn, which is very unusual for me. But I figured I was up and hungry so why not get good breakfast. Ordered Eggs Benedict with hash browns and why not add on a short stack it wouldn't be breakfast without them!  The eggs benedict was delicious, Canadian bacon, poached eggs covered in hollandaise sauce YUM! Could have gone without the hash browns not their best day.  But the short stack made up for them they were perfectly fluffy and just what I was craving. Good food and always great service keeps me coming back.!"}
{"text":"Tip: don't eat your coffee cake in its entirety before you have your breakfast. You'll be delightfully full before you get a chance to have your meal.   I came here twice for breakfast. Both times I left very satisfied with the food and the service. I look forward to coming back and trying their French toast!"}
{"text":"Popped in here for brekky wiv the Missus. She had a omelette and coffee and I had chicken fried steak and eggs and an OJ. Both breakfasts were delicious and the service was great..It was a reasonable price and would recommend this place to anyone..  Its where the locals seem to go so you know it will be nice.."}
{"text":"This is great place for your typical morning breakfast if you're too lazy to whip something up yourself. Nothing on the menu is out of the ordinary and its convenience of having 5 locations spread out throughout town is nice. I've been to almost all of them and they all serve the same quality of food and flavor. Also, they have a gluten sensitive menu available too and you can check it out on their webpage.   Whether you're in the mood for their \"breanne's basic\", \"fluffy and folded omelettes\" or \"eggs with attitude scramble\" you can't go wrong. Also, depending on how busy they are you might opt out of ordering an omelette since per usual they take longer to make. The portions are generous as well.    Today, I got a veggie skillet with turkey bacon. I was thrown off by the turkey bacon since it looks liked ham. It didn't taste like your regular turkey bacon too.   Overall it's a plain Jane spot with bland coffee to their entrees and sometimes that's exactly want you may want for the first meal of the day. And if it's not then bring your own sauce for flavor! Lol Oh and the service is just as bland. Perhaps out server had a case of the Mondays or something."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a quick breakfast spot since moving to this side of town. It's hardly ever quick but it's a usually a decent spot to grab a bite to eat in the morning. However, after my visit today I won't be dining here.  I got a garden skillet as usual with a side of toast. I ate a half a slice of the toast. Later grab another piece with noticed a strand of blonde hair. The individual I was dining with has brunette hair and mine is black. Clearly not our hair. The server stopped by our table and I brought it to her attention. I placed the toast on a separate plate and she took it away. Upon waiting for our receipt the server stated she took the charge for the toast off. Since I only had one cup of coffee I didn't feel the urge to make a comment that my entree came with toast there was no extra charge for her to take off. However, that didn't stop my friend who talked to the cashier who grabbed a manager who said yeah she gave you guys $1 off the cost of the toast. Oh and the tone of voice and body language was absurd. We paid for our check and left. Oh and we left a dollar tip for our waiter too. Hope she can buy herself a piece of toast one day. Jk That's a bit harsh but nothing compared to today's service. It's never about the money it's about the experience."}
{"text":"The service was great! We got seated right away and were able to put a drink order in right when we sat down.  They were also good on refilling my coffee.  The food came out pretty quick, the potatoes that came with my omelet were a little dry but over all it was very filling and great flavors. Will defiantly go back."}
{"text":"Have not been there in over 2 years! We had the worst service ever in the history of a restaurant. Over priced and not worth it. Stay away."}
{"text":"We were really bummed to discover that this neighborhood diner is nothing worth trying. Although it was cute when we walked in and sat at the checked counter, the service - while friendly - was almost as bad as the food. You expect a diner to be quick - especially at the counter. This one was not. And we could see our food sitting on the warmers for a few minutes before it came to our counter seats.   Once it arrived, however, we sort of wished it hadn't. The chocolate chip waffle was flavorless except for the chocolate and so soggy I could barely get a bite down.   A country Benedict was poorly cooked, the biscuit doughy and the \"poached\" eggs practically hard boiled. The gravy wasn't bad, but nothing could save the dish as a whole - especially given the bland, barely fried portion of limp hash browns that came out on the plate as a side.   We also ordered the BLT on sourdough which came with crinkle cut fries. Although a crinkle cut usually gives a fry more crevices to become crisp and salty, these fries were neither. A soggy pile of flavorless potatoes, I think frozen fries cooked at home in the microwave could have turned out just as well. And the bacon was fatty - and not in a good way. More like in the way that indicates to you the bacon was cheap and poor quality. And that was probably the best of our dishes!  We were eager to leave after this breakfast but, again, we had to wait some time to close out, which was frustrating given how close we were to the cash register. Now that we're gone, we certainly won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was located close to the resort we were staying at so why not give it a try?  My husband ordered the egg and cake combo and I got the Big Bad Wolf omelette.  The heading on the omelette section of the menu touted \"Fluffy & Folded\".  When my omelette arrived, there was a layer of oozing cheese on top that I had to scrape off...AND it was flat and not one bit fluffy.  I am used to omelettes where the ingredients are encased in fluffy eggs.  This one looked liked a scramble that was flattened and folded over.  Look at my picture and you can be the judge.  My husband liked his banana pancakes but I could barely finish my order.  IMO, there is nothing special about the breakfasts here.  We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They give Military Discount. Food is freshly made & the staff is very accommodating. Ashley is wonderful. Their Coffee is made by Cracked Egg.  Come in and enjoy Good Food, Good People & a Really Good Time"}
{"text":"Food was deelish, staff was pleasant and atmosphere was casual. We will definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak was so-so. French toast and the egg scrambles were good. Coffee cake was amazing. Warm and fluffy."}
{"text":"Great food. Great prices. And very delightful service. And mmmm coffee cake is delicious. Matter of fact everything here is delicious! Omg my bf got the monte cristo sanwich. WOW. what a scrumptious creation. Also gravy fried chicken is very good. Ucant go wrong here!!!"}
{"text":"First time at this location...1pm on a Tuesday. The food was good we got huevos rancheros and corned beef hash..but the service was ridiculously s l o w. It took 20 minutes after finishing the meal before the check was dropped :( good food though."}
{"text":"Walked into a busy restaurant which means it must be decent as people continue to come. Seated immediately. Waitress was kind and prompt. Food was delicious and delivered to table in a short amount of time. Will return."}
{"text":"So my second experience was alot better!I did come hungry and I ordered one of my go to breakfast items I eat which is chicken fried steak and eggs with country potatoes. They have redeemed themself and I enjoyed a great meal with great service.I'll be back to have this again"}
{"text":"I had my assistant call the Cracked Egg to ask for an owner I could send the below letter to. \"Curtis\" got on the phone, wouldn't give his last name, and yelled at my assistant! So with no other outlet than Yelp, here's the letter:  To Whom It May Concern:  I live very near the new Cracked Egg restaurant at Charleston and Hualapai. My inquisitive 3-year-old daughter watched with great anticipation as the new \"muffin store\" was being built, and the morning of 4/27/14 I took her there (she was very excited). I would normally bring my wife and 1-year-old son, but my wife was home sick with a cold.  What followed was the worst customer service experience of my life. Given the recent opening of the restaurant, wait staff and hostesses were understandably unpracticed and the operation wasn't running as smoothly as I expect it will over time. However, when I complained to the manager about needlessly waiting for 15 minutes after it was our turn to be seated, a man approached me, and with no introduction or conversation, promptly escorted me out the front door (my 3-year-old daughter riding on my hip), and rudely and loudly told me to \"get in my car, leave, and never come back.\" I encouraged him to listen to me, his customer, and he rudely told me \"look around, are you the only one here with an infant?\"   I'm not a loud, large, or scary-looking man; in fact, I'm a 47-year-old, well-respected member of the business community. I serve on two high profile community boards, and own and operate a small, local business. Suffice it to say, I've never been banned from any establishment, and found the whole experience horrifying, especially in light of having my young daughter with me.  The saddest part of this experience is my 3-year-old daughter now speaks (unsolicited) about the \"bad man at the Cracked Egg who wouldn't let us have pancakes and bacon.\" She shouldn't have to worry about facing hostility at any of our neighborhood establishments. It's shameful.  Sincerely, Jeff G."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location out of the Cracked Eggs. Employees are nice. I ordered an omelet well and I swear it was runny white, But...they took it back and brought another that was perfect. Sometrimes you just gotta give people a break :) Since I had to wait when the other 5 in my party were eating. It would have been nice if they would of offered up a complimentary juice or something. Just a thought...I wish I would have remebered the waiters name...he was very nice, Buffed dude..shaved head."}
{"text":"Yes, this IS a breakfast place, the 3rd one of the same name (NEWEST and closest to our place), but I do have to say, they make a damn good lunch.  Their breakfast is good (I've converted many visitors to coffee cake lovers) but don't overlook their lunch selections.  Actually, a wild idea, you can eat your lunch for breakfast!  They have some really great-tasting soups.  They do seem to change daily so don't be afraid to ask, it never seems to be written on their whiteboard.  In the past, they've had split pea, clam chowder and chicken tortilla.    My favorite is their burgers.  They are very fresh tasting/looking.  These are burgers that I crave!  They are always cooked perfectly (medium for me, well-done for the hubby) and always taste so good!  They are large in size and well worth the money ($6.95 - 8.25).  We like the basics so we stick to cheeseburgers and they are always good.  Although, when it is a special, I love their mushroom burger.  I've yet to try their Kobe burger ($11.95) but I will add it to my must try list from this place.  Here's my hint when ordering, ask for their seasoned potatoes.  Much better choice than their ordinary fries and are a perfect side with any breakfast."}
{"text":"Coffee cake. Get the coffee cake. It is not always the same from day to day or hour to hour. Food is filling and service is outstanding. Come earl yon the weekend as this place gets busy. The skillet meals re the best around. Chicken fried steak is better than most and have good gravy. you leave very full. Service is quick there is no delay in waiting for food."}
{"text":"Ok since this has been my go to place for breakfast i was very lenient with the mistakes and downfalls of this restaurant but today when they not only missed an entire entree for a to go order, couldn't get my name right and i couldn't get a straight answer when i asked how long it would take to get my missed order it sent me over the top and that is why i'm changing this 5 star review to a 1 star....i'll drive the extra 30 seconds down rainbow to the egg works next time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food was beyond delicious. The combinations are fresh. This place will put you in a food coma!"}
{"text":"The service was ok but the food was not.  I tried some kind of scramble and my father got the steak and eggs.  Neither one of us finished our plate.  My scramble was supposed to be bacon and an over easy egg on top of potatos.  I could not find the bacon and the over easy egg was well done.  I told the waitress the egg was over cooked and she said that's how they do it to ensure safety which i understand.  I ask for some country gravy to help ease my pain and she ended up charging us $2 for a side of gravy.    My dad asked for a medium steak.  That steak was so thin that it couldn't be helped but to come out well done.  He was also no to pleased that they did not have hash browns."}
{"text":"I've been missing out.  Apparently The Cracked Egg is not affiliated with Egg Works or Egg & I (the usual breakfast spots I frequent).  So the original plan was to go to the new Egg Works in Summerlin, but my friend actually drove us to this joint which also recently opened.    Saturday brunch - 25 min wait.  Well, let me take this time to walk over to Smiths and buy cookies and Cheez its.  At least there was something to do during the wait.  I give the food 5 stars.  All the dishes were super good.  We ordered: - California omelette: bacon slices wrapped in an omelet with a sliced avocado on top, served with seasoned potatoes and choice of coffee cake or toast - Hot Pastrami sandwich on a roll.  There were some bacon slices and cheese.  The seasoned fries were DELICIOUS, very seasoned and tasty.  Crispy, not soggy. - Nutella french toast topped with mini marshmallows and graham crackers.  We thought this dish would be too sweet for one person's meal, so we shared.  Right amount of Nutella, it wasn't lacking.  Didn't even need to really dip in syrup bc it was sweet.  Only ate half of it.  Service was not the greatest, hence the 1 star deduction.  The coffee cake was never brought out, so we asked the waitress to pack it to-go for us.  We waited a while for the check.  I will definitely go back, but I hope the service is better.  If only this were Egg Works and they had that yellow egg on the table to notify servers when we need assistance."}
{"text":"On my visit I ordered several menu items with my kids, and everything was delicious. The service was attentive and spot-on! I would return to this location and recommend it. Most important to me, after great food, is how they treat their employees. Our server raved about how well they treated their employees and how he started washing dishes and worked his way up!"}
{"text":"Saw review in from Ohio last day in Vegas. Wait was not that long maybe 1 min even though they were busy. Coffee cake is delicious, ordered the Mexican skillet it was Spicey yet not over the top very good would come back if in town again"}
{"text":"Darn it. I just realized as I started to write my review that I had a choice of coffee cake, but the waitress simply asked me what kind of toast I wanted, which made me forget the coffee cake! The coffee cake denial almost forced me to take a two star deduction because I can make better toast than the whole wheat that was delivered to me instead of the cakey treat. However, I will be kind... for now.   I ordered a vegetarian skillet and had them hold the cheese. I recommend this if you want a little lighter breakfast. I added some ketchup and hot sauce to create a delicious offering. The ingredients seemed fresh, and there was no heavy breakfast grease. The skillet potatoes were not covered with any magic dusting of spices, but they were still tasty.   One added bonus is that with most of the breakfasts they offer  a choice of shredded hash browns or cubed potatoes. Have you ever been to Waffle House? Well, these hash browns are like those, except with about 1/3 of the grease, and I am pretty sure you can't get them diced, smothered, and covered.  On a Saturday morning around 9:30am there was no wait. Our waitress was nice and prompt. Our food was delivered in a timely manner.   I will be back for my coffee cake."}
{"text":"Esta muy rico i si no traes varo está bien por qué es muy barato pide fruta y club Sandwich con huevo . Está rico es bueno  y barato"}
{"text":"If you're into breakfast, this is a good place.   We went on a Sunday morning, and that was ill-advised. The place was packed with what looked like regulars, and we had a 20+ minute wait.   We were shown to a table and service was decent. Within a couple minutes we had our drinks and placed our orders. I got the Country Bennie, which is like eggs Benedict with country gravy. She got the Cracked Croissant, which is a croissant sandwich with eggs, cheese and such. Both came with better than average hash browns.  Both were very good. The portions are fair, and should fill you up. I had to bring some food to someone at home, so I ordered up a couple Monte Cristo's. They were good, but not as good as other places. That being said, Monte Cristo's are hard to find, and I'm glad they have them.  The coffee cake looks amazingly good, although I did not have any.  One tip: The price is fair, but I did notice we seem to be the only one paying without a coupon. They do seem to also be in the coupon mailer, so if you haven't tossed it out yet, and you're thinking about going to The Cracked Egg, you should look for the coupon."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. The coffee cake was surprisingly good, great coffee, toasty goodness in the potatoes, and a perfect vegetarian Eggs Benedict. The eggs were poached to medium well and so yummy! My husband had the vegetarian scramble which was delicious, he didn't even miss the bacon! We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast...great service...long wait on Sunday's!!!"}
{"text":"I'm vegan so not a lot of choices, but they had a great oatmeal. Thought it was a bit pricey at almost $10, but what a glorified bowl it was. Topped with fresh berries, raisins, and granola. Shared with hubby and still took some home."}
{"text":"This place is cute and quaint. They have decorative pictures and things all around the walls. The food here is amazing!! The scrambles are yum!! I recommend the south shore scramble!! The seasoned potatoes are great as well, they don't have any onions or anything added like some places do. Also definitely try the coffee cake! They have different flavor a everyday and they are all delish! Service is spot on too. Everyone is sweet and friendly. Love!!!"}
{"text":"Came in here for breakfast on new years eve with the craving for biscuits and gravy. Unfortunately it was a 25 minute way but it was well worth the wait. I love he fact that they have Apple jam for toast! Great place and atmosphere !"}
{"text":"I've come here on many occasions. However the last two times I've come here and ordered the gluten free pancakes and a side of bacon, I've gotten sick from it. Other items on their gluten free menu have been fine. Prices are fair. Service is generally good."}
{"text":"Eggs benedict - yummo! (Real ham) Breakfast potatoes - great. Salsa - pretty good. Coffee cake - I should've got some to go. Service was great. Everyone with us enjoyed the food and the prices were decent."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and helpful. Food is always yummy. We've tried a few different things and everything is consistently good."}
{"text":"This place was eggsellent!!! Super friendly service, clean, relaxed ambiance, and wonderful food. I had the server pick my breakfast. She chose the chili verde with eggs. OMG! It was FABULOUS!  Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"We visited on 4/11/17 while on spring break vacation. We were lucky and got seated right away in their last booth (waited a minute for them to clean it up for us!). Server was friendly and prompt! We ordered the (special of the day) Confetti Pancakes (rainbow sprinkles, white chocolate chips & side of cream cheese icing); Veggie Benny (sliced avocado, fresh spinach, grilled tomatoes and two poached eggs, smothered in hollandaise sauce); and Tropical French Toast (toasted coconut, macadamia nuts, topped with sliced bananas). Everything was so good! My daughter liked her confetti pancakes and ate it without the syrup or cream cheese frosting as it was already sweet from the sprinkles and white chocolate chips. Wish there was a Cracked Egg chain in Los Angeles...we'll just have to visit Vegas more often. :) Prices were decent and was expected for what you got. Everyone was a happy camper!"}
{"text":"My family took me and the fella out for breakfast this weekend to take our minds off of some stress we have going on, and we decided to go to The Cracked Egg.  We had a party of 8, and when we arrived, we were told it would be about a 20 minute wait...they were packed, but we were seated within about 15 minutes or so.    The menu is big, but not overwhelming, and they had something for everyone.    I've been on a new nutrition plan the last 2 weeks, and wanted to continue trying to eat somewhat healthy, and I was pleased to know that they offer healthy options.  They give you an option for egg whites (I prefer the whole egg for my breakfast...get some of the good fat into my diet), and rather than seasoned potatoes or hash browns, they give you the option to have a fresh fruit plate with your breakfast.  I ordered The Greek Omlette, which had spinach, diced tomatoes, and feta cheese on top.  It was really good, and not too big, like so many other places.    My fella had the cobb salad with no avocado, and oil and vinegar dressing.  He enjoyed it, however, a word of caution:  Don't order the Hot Bacon dressing.  It appears to be ranch dressing with bacon grease mixed in.  It wasn't served hot, and it was absolutely disgusting. (I took a small taste.)   The breakfast also came with coffee cake, which I, sadly, only had a small bite of...but it was really good too.  All in all, the food was solid.  Not anything mind-blowing, but it was a good choice.  Service was a little slow to start, as it took a little while for someone to come over for drink orders...and by the time they did, we knew what we wanted to eat, but realistically, it wasn't that bad of a wait...we got to visit a bit, and the place WAS packed.    I'd come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Finally a viable alternative to OPH has come to Henderson!  Lately I'm into egg whites. I'm always sad because OPH won't scramble me some egg whites and put yummy things like mushrooms and green peppers in them! They claim veggies are for omlettes only.. So imagine my excitement when I see Cracked Egg has scrambled egg whites on the menu! With protein and veggies! They customized my egg whites to be grilled chicken + mushrooms at no extra cost. Egg whites came with delish hashbrowns + amazing soft coffee cake. Fiance got a customizable skillet. Love the options to customize that Cracked Egg has!!   Service sucked or I would give them 5 stars. Waiter brought my eggs without the mushrooms originally (and took a LONG time to bring it back corrected). He never brought the fiance's toast out... ever.   Overall a great alternative to OPH when I'm not feeling pancakes... but maybe their pancakes will be better here too! I'm anxious to try them."}
{"text":"Brought my mom and grandmother here....Good food, and servings are plenty! Waitress was very attentive as well"}
{"text":"I would even add another half star to this. I didn't give it 5 stars only because I don't think breakfast should cost $12.00.  BUT...... Food was so good!  And big sized. Biscuits and gravy are phenomenal, homemade. Meals are served with big slices of coffee cake. And service is so friendly.  There's a wait, but it goes fast.  We ordered biscuits & gravy, southwest scramble, and Benedict ole. Everything was tasty and hit the spot. Leaving here stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"We were a table.of six and they accommodated to us with no issues.  We had breakfast so we had chicken fried steak and pancakes and biscuits and gravy... everything was awesome! The food was great tasting, it came in great portions and we had great service.  Our server Ashley was very attentive a d very kind.  We're coming back next time were back in town for spring training!"}
{"text":"I wanted to go to Bouchon but ended up here instead.  Super starving and I knew I would be waiting in line for Bouchon so we went here.  We waited for about 10 minutes before we were seated.  This place is overrated IMO.  Why overrated?  Because my food was average.  My carnitas omelette was just okay.  Nothing special.  Yelpers also mentioned how good the coffee cake was.  Did I like the coffee cake?  I like the fact that it was warm.  3 stars!!  The Cracked Egg is almost yumylicious!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite haunts for lunch! I love Emily and Erin - twins that are both the best and make me feel welcome every time! I have never had bad service at this location and it is close to work. The coffee cake is so unique - different all the time - and their coffee is wonderful. I love the food - tasty and plentiful. There is a lot of fun pictures and decorations on the walls -  the coffee pix are my favorites. Their rewards program is really great - I get coupons with $$ off all the time which brings me back as well."}
{"text":"I grew up in Jersey, the land of the diner, and I must say that The Cracked Egg brought me back to that townie down home diner I have come to live without since moving out of the Garden State. I recommend sitting at the counter, because you can get a great view of how the kitchen works and have great conversation with locals. We met a guy with an exotic car rental and I believe he thought we had moved to Vegas because this place is removed from the strip. It was awesome to hear his recommendations on what to order, his business, and what he loved about the area. We swapped Big Island stories and learned that we had seen one of his cars on the strip earlier in the week! I had a skillet with sweet potatoes, apple, bacon, munster cheese, and 2 eggs over easy. Everything was cooked just the way I liked it- I dare say \"like grandma used to make\" except  my grandma never made me eggs- but if she did I imagine this is how she would do it. The husband got the green scramble which was packed with veggies, he asked for sweet potatoes instead of hash browns (extra charge but well worth it in our book) and they came out great. The coffee refills were free but we had already drank our coffee (which is how we functioned enough to find this place) and I had tomato juice. I will send any and all of my friends off the strip to find The Cracked Egg. Everything looked spectacular leaving the counter (pancakes the size of plates!!!!!!) and from the look of it, The Cracked Egg is pretty popular! All in all, if we ever find ourselves in Vegas again, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast meals that feel like you're having a home cooked breakfast. A lot of different things to choose from, like a wide selection of Benedicts, your classic egg and sausage, or potato skillets. Some of the meals Come with a choice of Toast or Coffee Cake. Be sure to ask what Coffee Cake they have because it changes almost everyday which allows you to try many different kinds of coffee cakes."}
{"text":"This is our go to breakfast place. Always good service and good food. We go there about 3-4 times a month. Great coffee cake, seasoned potatoes & lots of classic choices. Never disappointed there."}
{"text":"We just decided to try this place yesterday morning. We were so impressed that we came back again this morning. That says a lot, in my opinion.  Most of the food is very, very good, but I want to start things off by mentioning the one dish that caused me to drop this from a 5 to a 4 star review: the coffee cake. I'm not really a big cake fan, but after reading all of the glowing reviews, I decided to give theirs a shot. Any quality it might of had was instantly and unforgivably overridden by that distinct, tell-tale taste and texture of a microwave! What the hell? A microwave? Yeah, sure, that's the kind of taste-deadening, corner-cutting, smoke & mirrors crap people expect from a Taco Bell, but not at a place like this. It was really disappointing and, being the first dish out, a rather disheartening first-impression too. I've read people's reviews, where they talk about how \"steamy\" and \"fresh\" it is, but the steam is artificial and the \"fresh\" appearance is completely false. At least to anyone clever enough to understand that, unless you time things unnaturally well, no cake is likely to ever be served \"steaming fresh\" at a restaurant, that is. Considering how good and legitimately-fresh the rest of the food is, this approach really, REALLY baffles me. Trust me, guys, your cake would be so much better if you a) cooked several batches a day or b) just left it room temperature and honest. Microwaving your food is flat-out insulting to your business and your customers. I thoroughly enjoyed both of my meals, but I wouldn't step in that cake again. Really disgusting bullshit! Get it together!  Beyond that, everything else tasted fantastic (thus the 4 stars)! I simply detest eggs, so I order my meals without. Yesterday, I had the \"Mexican skillet\" and, boy howdy, it was great! The chorizo and salsa were an awesome compliment to the already phenomenal potatoes. I see myself having this same dish again quite soon. Today, I had the country fried steak and it was, honestly, one of the best I've ever eaten. The steak was tender and juicy and the breading was crisp and well-seasoned. Really, really good stuff. I will also be having it again soon. My wife had the biscuits and gravy, which she said was really good, but not quite the way she likes them. Then again, she apparently had that particular bar set quite high when she was younger. She also had the huevos rancheros, which she said was excellent.   Also, both days, the staff was quite friendly and helpful, though I do wish people/servers would understand that \"water\" doesn't mean \"water with lemon\". I know this is apparently standard practice at many restaurants, but I personally think that, if someone orders just \"water\", you should probably ask if they want a strong-flavored fruit wedge submerged in it before just automatically adding it. Maybe that's just us, but much like with every other single aspect of my dining experiences, If I don't specifically ask for something, I DO NOT want it. Simple enough?  With all of that being said, there really isn't any question about us being repeat customers here. There are some problems, but the staff is pretty friendly and most of the food is absolutely phenomenal."}
{"text":"I love this place for a good sit-down breakfast with my friends, if not for the fresh cupcake-like texture of the frosted coffee cake.   They're kind enough to make it the first course, and by the time you've devoured it down your ample-portioned meal you ordered will be ready.  Seriously, two people could split an omelette or a scramble and get by peachy.    But be sure to order two coffee cakes, don't break up a relationship like that!"}
{"text":"Didn't know you could screw up breakfast and yet they did. Eggs and bacon were greasy. Hash brown and seasoned potatoes were dry. Even the salad was lukewarm. Never again!"}
{"text":"My friend swore this was the best place ever for breakfast, true it is good and it does have some signature breakfasts, but the service is hit or miss...  sometimes you will get quick refills on coffee, other times you will sit there with an empty cup...  I still go frequently  My biggest complaint.. the price.. 2 eggs and some bacon shouldn't be anywhere near 6 bucks in my opinion...  there are good deals on the menu and bad ones..   I guess it depends on what you are in the mood for...  Oh and military discount???  Yeah you have to be in uniform to get it.. who in there right mind is going to be wearing their uniform on the weekend, and what does it matter if you are in uniform or not?!?!  If you go on the weekend, make sure you get there early, all the late nighters looking to cure a hangover will get there around 10 ish and the wait will be long, early yelper gets the worm!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Always good food and good service.  We had a nice large piece of hot chocolate coffee cake before my skillet came out of the kitchen. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. The food came out very quickly. Only frustration is that I never seem to have my \"Cracked Egg\" black rewards card on me, and they don't have a way to look up my account. Can't imagine how many hundreds of points I've missed out over the years."}
{"text":"I wanted a late breakfast on Saturday afternoon and was excited to try the Cracked Egg. While the portions were great, the food was slightly bland and the prices were quite high for your \"typical breakfast.\""}
{"text":"I love this restaurant it's so close to my house not a huge wait time during there busy hours, food is always consistent and very reasonable prices being located in summerlin.My favorite item is the Las Vegas style chicken sandwich with the house fries! For some odd reason I can't help but want that sandwich  every single time I'm here lol"}
{"text":"My family came here for breakfast on Christmas Eve around noon, and to my surprise we were immediately seated. Normally there's at least a 15+ minute wait for breakfast at the widely popular Cracked Egg.   TWO EGG BREAKFAST ($6.99): Sometimes simpler is better. Served with hash browns and a slice of coffee cake. The scrambled eggs were cooked to perfection and the hash browns were on the crispy side, but still good. A nice dash of Cholula kept things interesting. Think of the coffee cake as more of a sugary pastry. The coffee cake has chunks of Oreo in the loaf and is topped with a sweet icing. It's served warm and in a generous portion size. 4/5   HAM & EGGS ($7.99): My mom got hers with seasoned potatoes and over easy eggs. This a hearty breakfast for sure! She was very content with her breakfast meal. 4/5  CAKES & EGGS COMBO ($8.99): Two pancakes, two eggs, and two sausage or bacon. My dad was a fan of this combo! I stole some of his pancakes and they were moist, thick, and fluffy (basically everything you would want in a pancake). 4/5  CHICKEN SANDWICH ($9.99): My husband decided to be the odd ball and opted for lunch instead. He chose the seasoned potatoes as well - these tasted like french fries and were more lunch-y than breakfast-y. He said the sandwich was good and cleared his entire plate. 4/5  SERVICE: Our waitress was pleasant, accommodating, and stayed on top of things. Kudos to her for handling our party of 6 so well (two kiddos were in tow).   The Cracked Egg is a solid spot for breakfast. It's even better when there's no wait!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #2"}
{"text":"Items selected:  Coffee Peach Coffee Cake Monte Cristo - Turkey, Ham, Swiss Peanut Butter Stuffed French Toast - Peanut Butter Cream Cheese Filling, Honey, Bananas Croissant French Toast - Seasonal Berries, Banana, Powdered Sugar  With my mother in town for two more days another weekend of eating and unpacking began at local favorite \"The Cracked Egg\" and although I have to say the kitsch décor and happy holiday tunes contrasted severely with weary and disinterested service the food itself was quite good.  Clearly known for their daily interpretations of classical coffee cake I will admit that I was a tad put off by both the microwaving and obvious use of canned peaches (as well as artificial syrup sitting on the counter) but speaking only to flavor the cake truly is as good as the rumors; light as angel food but topped with sugary streusel and rife with fruit.  Moving next to three plates divided and shared the kitchen again proved more than competent with diner classics and although ingredient quality could certainly be better the fried Monte Cristo was a truly faithful rendition of the classic yet not overly greasy while the French toasts were each rich and flavorful, the croissant version compromised by mushy blueberries but loaded with butter while peanut butter was a skilled kissed version of a childhood favorite, the sort of memories immune to ingredient quality or surly service and just plain delicious."}
{"text":"Food here at the Cracked Egg is always excellent! Never had a bad meal. Usually have to wait for a table, but worth it! Staff is friendly! Great family atmosphere."}
{"text":"Totally over-priced food. 10 bucks for a burger that was decently okay? Yeah I'll pass next time. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"I love this place! The biscuits and gravy are awesome. Same with the eggs Benedict. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre. There's nothing great about it. I ordered the croissant french toast, side eggs and toast. I wouldn't come back. Side note, customer service was decent.."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy this place! I think it's the perfect Saturday morning breakfast spot. I go here a lot with my Mom and we absolutely love it.   I've never had any complaints about the food. The California omelet is my favorite. My only advice is, try to get seated before 9a.m. on weekends. Or else, expect a lot of noisy people, some annoying kids and lines.   You got this! Get there before 9a.m."}
{"text":"Happy and friendly staff work here nice clean restaurant I had breakfast and I will be returning again and bringing family members I can't believe how busy it is on a Thursday"}
{"text":"I can't believe we found this place on our last morning in Vegas, this will be a staple on our future trips to sin city. What an awesome diner, great food, great service, and you have an option of getting a piece of coffee cake before your breakfast, which was one of the lightest most delicious things that I have ever tasted. The chicken fried steak skillet scramble with cheese was incredible, and in true diner fashion your cup of coffee was never empty. I'll be back in June!"}
{"text":"Didn't look open.  The sign and internet said it was.   It was early and was conserving electricity.   I assume.  French toast and Bacon and Eggs were excellent.   The OJ was totally Underwhelming and expensive.  Nice breakfast in an early morning."}
{"text":"You wake up some time between 8am and 10am, ready to get your weekend started. You're a Las Vegas resident. You live off the strip. It's time to get some grub. Where do you go? The Cracked Egg is your only thought.   That's right folks, The Cracked Egg presents hearty, diner-style food at reasonable prices. Sure, you might not have unlimited champagne, bloody mary's or mimosas... but the flavor of the food here can't be beat.   My party of 4 was thoroughly pleased... I had the special, which was some sort of grilled chicken with spinach and mushrooms and cheese on sourdough bread. The chicken was succulent, not overdone but not underdone. The sourdough was toasty and firm (not soggy from sitting too long). The mushrooms and spinach tasted fresh and coupled with the cheese provided a great flavor/texture contract.   My dad had the South Shore omelette... he actually finished everything. That's a good sign for him.   Other diners had the Carnitas Omelette and Eggs Benedict. 4 thumbs up from them.   Service was great, never had to ask for more coffee or water. Atmosphere isn't sexy or trend-setting, but comfortable and fitting. The bill was reasonable... about what you'd expect from any diner in the country. I'd definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Good omelet with spinach, mushrooms, cheese, avocado and sour cream. Hash browns, coffee cake & coffee. Everything was freshly made, and tasted so wonderful. Laura was our server and she was awesome.  If you ask for her, save me a seat in her section - she's great!!"}
{"text":"This place is busy and it seems it's busy for a reason.  The wife and I swung by on a whim for breakfast at around 9:30am on a Friday.  After a brief wait we were taken to our table.  Our waitress was pretty quick to get to us and after a brief bit of confusion over the day's specials we had our food no more than 10 minutes later.  Our food was quite good.  I had the special -- a pizza-inspired scramble -- and my wife enjoyed her chili verde egg dish quite a bit.  Not that we're up for breakfast all that often, but if we are and feel like going out instead of eating in we'll consider returning to The Cracked Egg."}
{"text":"If you want a small town feel, then you came to the right place. Everyone here is extremely nice and makes you feel like you're a regular. This was my first time being here. The food came in decent proportions and of course tasted pretty darn good! Btw, if you come after 11am they give you free ice cream after your meal!! Ugh, you can't beat that. Our server was Penny. She was spunky, had a great personality and I wouldn't mind having her again."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday morning an ordered The Country Benny for $15.   - Fast and friendly service. I sat down and ordered right away.  - Not a good price to food ratio.  - A biscuit split and topped with patty sausage, 2 pooched eggs and smothered in gravy - Choice of seasoned potatoes or hash browns. I got the hash browns.  - I guess I was expecting something better than Wicked Spoon's Egg benedict. - Tasted good, but not great. Enjoyed the gravy, but I think it made it all gooey. But I guess that's the country style.  - Better with hot sauce!  - This place is a good alternative if you don't feel like going to Babystacks or HashHouse."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere and fast service. The coffee cake was great! They had colored pencils for kids to keep busy. The signs and decorations were cute. We were staying at the red rock resort nearby and this was perfect for getting out and eating somewhere else."}
{"text":"Clean environment. Professional staff. Fair prices. Large selection of American breakfasts, and good selection for lunch.   The food is good; on par from what you'd expect. Does get busy after 10 am, but I've not (yet) had to wait more than 10-15 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"Service was very good but the food took too long considering not many people in placem steak and eggs was weak for the price"}
{"text":"They make the best feta egg white omelet. Its not too watery like another egg place in town.the service is fine (that's why I gave it 4 out 5 stars ).my breakfast was not cheap.. 12.75$ with coffee plus tip.I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The place was small, but decorated very nicely.  It was busy, but we were seated in about 20-25 minutes.  I had the original eggs Benedict, I enjoyed each and every bite of my plate, they were delicious.  My MIL and her sister had the huevos rancheros and they enjoyed that as well.  I will definitely be coming back to this location again!"}
{"text":"Good Food , Service is slow but we sat at bar and we were in and out . The waitress very nice and helpful, you can see from a far whats going on in the kitchen ,it is pretty messy  the reviews about this place cleanliness is really true . floors are not clean .the were two male waiters playing around and basically not doing anything and they didn't bother to ask what we wanted even though they were in front of us in the bar , the Bold Tall guy was just like he didn't care if he had customers . other than that  is good food and big portion and good prices, kudos to  the female waitress who were the only ones  working there besides the Mexican cook ."}
{"text":"Food was really great, came out very quickly and tasted awesome. My only complaints would be at how small and cramped the location is, especially on a Sunday morning around 10 am. And the other being that my server had absolutely no personality what so ever. It was like talking to a wet rag."}
{"text":"BIRTHDAY SPECIAL!   We didn't plan on eating here this was plan B but... this place is in the running for an optional A! We celebrated our daughters 9th b day and overall she left full so with that being said let's get into it.  CHILE VERDE RANCHEROS an open-faced tortilla with black beans, seasoned pork and two eggs any style. topped with chile verde sauce, jack cheese and sour cream was on the side but I will say this dish looked like an appetizer. I was quite disappointed, but as I began to dig in and the flavors started to work on me I realized WOW! This is really good. Along side my English tea I was really satisfied by the end of the meal and more full than I expected. Overall the service was better than good, the service was on point and the setting looked packed but they set us up very nice! A small critique try not to bump into the customers chairs so much! Keep up the good work and happy Birthday to my baby Mae daddy loves you."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! While in Vegas, my family and I were trying to find a great place to have breakfast and we came across The Cracked Egg via Yelp and so glad we decided to try it. The food is fantastic and the staff was so great!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I work in the area and despite my mediocre rating, I frequent this location and have quite a few positive things to say about it. The big one is there's a 9 out of 10 chance that you will have exceptional service. The wait staff has been here for ages. I've been in the area 5 years and it's almost the same staff as when I first came in. They are pretty much on top of everything - they're attentive to when you are sat, if your drinks are running low, and they always make sure you have the check before you ask for it. Plus if you're a regular, they have down too.   While their omelettes and scrambles are quite good, I usually come here around lunch time so I'm not feeling eggy. My usual at this location is the soup (Tortilla Soup is the house soup Monday- Thursday) and half sandwich (BLT for me please). I've tried other items on the menu but each time, I wish I just stuck with my usual. Their sandwiches are bland and uneventful. Their idea of ciabatta bread is my definition of a hamburger bun...their wraps are not missing some punch.  My biggest gripe is paying the check. The cashier\hostess stand is not an efficient set up for people coming in or wanting to get out. It's doubly worse when the cashier and the hostess are the same lady. It can get backed up pretty quickly. It stinks when you have to wait awhile to be seated for no good reason, and then have to wait even longer to pay your tab.  All in all it's nothing spectacular. There are plenty of other places in the area with more personality BUT there's nothing terrible about it - it's just a-okay."}
{"text":"Was looking for some breakfast this morning and came across this place on Yelp and decided to check it out. We were seated quickly and welcomed by a couple different people. The food was excellent and the portions were enormous. I think I got through maybe half my skillet before having to call it quits. Everyone we came in contact with was friendly and I will definitely be coming back; they have some lunch items that I need to sample."}
{"text":"Please RUN, do not WALK to The Cracked Egg for breakfast!  I highly recommend the seasoned hashbrowns.  And, when they give you the choice between toast or coffee cake, for the love of all things delicious, CHOOSE THE COFFEE CAKE!  It is amazing.  One star off for being a little overpriced for breakfast, but this is by far the best breakfast joint around."}
{"text":"I like this location even more than the Green Valley one, which is where I go most often.  The restaurant is clean with lots of comfortable seating.  I've never had poor service here.  The wait staff are always so friendly and attentive.   Holy coffee cake.  I literally can't believe something so a-freaking-mazing comes with my breakfast!  The flavors are always different and the highlight of my meal is finding out which one I'll have that day.  I've loved all the meals I've ever had here.  And the seasoned potatoes are a total guilty pleasure.    The prices can't be beat.  We always get a buy one get one coupon in the View newspaper.    The Cracked Egg is such a no-brainer for breakfast (even at lunchtime, which I do often!)."}
{"text":"Great food, great environment, my waitress was do friendly, food good and hot. They were very prompt with service and me asking questions also treated my grandbaby so sweetly because she was asking alot of questions."}
{"text":"An elevated Egg and I. Menu is pretty standard, the food is good and price point is good. The ambience was odd-seemed empty. Overall a decent place to grab breakfast. Service was ok, they seemed understaffed."}
{"text":"I always forget about this place when it's breakfast time. Finally remembered and was so happy that I did. We went on a Saturday morning, it was busy but we were seated right away. The waitress was super nice and brought our drinks right away.  There were 3 of us. We ordered a cheese, ham and mushroom omelette with seasoned potatoes and 2 orders of Chile Verde Rancheros\" An open-faced corn tortilla with Black Beans, Seasoned Pork and Two Eggs any style. Topped with Chile Verde Salsa, Jack Cheese and Sour Cream. These came with seasoned potatoes or hash browns. We chose the potatoes.  The Chili Verde Rancheros were to die for. I loved it so much we went for breakfast again the next day. Ha! I never do that. When we went on Sunday we only had to wait about 5 minutes.  This is by far the best breakfast place I have been to. A great local choice. Can't wait to return, I can taste the Chili Verde right now."}
{"text":"A favorite breakfast spot. Always great service and better food!! Happy employees mean a well run business. Always our #1 place. Love the counter staff.  Consistent."}
{"text":"Not only is the  menu so extensive, even the gluten free menu is extensive!  (Seriously - this place has a great GF menu.) The prices are super reasonable ($10 for the veggie scramble!) and the food is really good. This is more if you're in the mood for diner food/comfort food than if you're in the mood for fancy brunch, but I find myself always in the mood for the Home-y vibe and great food."}
{"text":"Lots of good food!!! Eggcellent breakfast !!  They use Pamela's mix for the gluten free pancakes I didn't find  the pancakes as tasteful vas other places  but ok  nonetheless"}
{"text":"Am still on the hunt for a sublime breakfast experience. I want a Hallelujah chorus when I bite into something. So lacking that eye rolling to the back and spit drooling experience.... In the meantime, this is one of those stops to the elusive brunch heaven. Seems to  be a favorite with locals. Decent, good enough. Got the egg scramble, bacon and short stack of macadamia - coconut pancakes (comes two to a plate). Substantial, flavorful, hot, and good coffee pour here. Friendly waitress. You can hang out for a little bit, since it's a very large establishment. Only issue I had : it was a bear getting to here from the strip - you basically have to make a huge approximately 8 mile U turn to bypass the strip and get out into outlying suburbia to get here. Then the rest of Vegas looks like any other suburb with the Starbucks and strip mall business."}
{"text":"Way above average breakfast spot. To be honest...the portions are too big here...the prices are too expensive...the food is excellent and the service is very prompt. you must come here hungry or don't bother. I had the big bad wolf fluffy and folded omelet..loaded with ingredients. Wife had the tropical French toast..topped with coconut..macadamia nuts and bananas. she was thrilled with her selection. My son had the huevos rancheros. we were all happy campers..even the hash browns were delicious. This is a solid place...its a mini chain( 5 locations) in greater vegas. Noisy,crowded and very very good."}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast!  I had the GVP white egg omelette it was awesome!  Most important the service was outstanding I sat at the counter and the young lady who was my server didn't outstanding job and I will deathly come back!"}
{"text":"Foreign boyfriend wants huge American breakfast! Enter Cracked Egg.   Cracked Egg has the requisite American-style breakfasts. Massive omelets, scrambles, waffles, pancakes, etc. Literally huge portion sizes. Its like an upscale Blueberry Hill or Denny's. Place is a bit packed and incredibly busy. Service was good, but the noise level was a bit overwhelming. Although the food was good, I think the busy atmosphere is a bit of downer."}
{"text":"I wouldnt say that its a bad place, but it certainly does not live up to the hype or 30+ minute wait on a Sunday morning.  Service was lacking and while they were busy, I made eye contact with our waiter several times while he stood around chatting with the other staff. We received only one drink refill (which was long before our food arrived) and had to wait at least 15 minutes after finishing for our check.  I had the \"country benny\" (biscuts and gravy with a poached egg) which was bland and tasteless. Making matters worse was the fact that it must have sat out for a long time while my wife's food was prepared - cold and the breakfast potatoes (uninspired but decent enough) were soggy.  I am not the type to send food back, but I would have had our waiter bothered to stop by.  I was impressed that the front staff seemed to actually care when I responded honestly to the standard, \"How was it?\" during checkout. They offered to get the manager and I'm sure would have made it right, but I had already decided not to return.  For Denny's it would be acceptable, but for nearly $15 a plate and an hour wait? I think not."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our breakfast here.  A little pricey but worth it.  Service was superb and the food was delicious.  Pancakes were a little heavy, I'd go with a short stack."}
{"text":"We originally visited the Cracked Egg due to their gluten free options since my young son has Celiac Disease. It's hard to find a breakfast spot that provides GF options in Las Vegas.  We've now been 4x to the same location and really like the food. It's portions are generous and the food well prepared and tasty. I've had three different omelets and all were exceptional. The pancakes and French toast also great.  My ink gripe, and why my rating is what it is, has to do with service. Service at the front (seating you even when not swamped) is extremely slow. Also, wait service seems to be the same. Our last visit was horrendous. The wait staff seems large but they move in slow motion.  Prices here are also pretty high. We don't have much choice but there are probably breakfast spots as good at a lower price."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for breakfast. The portions are nice but the prices are a little high. The first time I went I had the eggs benedict, which would have been wonderful if it weren't for the mysterious piece of gristle in my ham. They serve the eggs on a very thick slice of ham, which had a really smooth smoky flavor.The home fries are delicious! The second time I went was on a Saturday morning, which meant waiting for 45 minutes for a table. That time I ordered the chicken fried steak, which was very satisfying. It was a large piece of steak and had the nice crispy crust that I like. The gravy was rich and smooth, not chalky like some tend to be. My Mother-in-law ordered the french toast and loved it.   I really like this place, it's just too long of a wait and a little overpriced."}
{"text":"I have had mixed opinions on this restaurant for a number of reasons.   The good:  The country fried steak and eggs are delicious! The portion is huge and the piece of country fried steak keeps it's crunchy composure when covered in the gravy.   Omelets- I haven't eaten a bad omelet here. The options are endless and all get served with nice fluffy eggs and those scrumptious fried potatoes!   The service- Is always top notch. Drinks are always refilled and you never have to wait 30 minutes for a check.   The not-so-good:  Eggs Benedict- I once ordered this entree and the piece of ham had a huge piece of cartilage in it. It spanned across half of the piece of ham. It was so unappetizing that it took me almost 6 months to return here to eat.   The long wait time- If you are unfortunate enough to get here after 9am on a weekend or on a holiday, be prepared to wait. I have waited in excess of 30 minutes for a table of 2. I attribute the long wait to the lack of non-IHOP breakfast joints in the Centennial Hills area. We need an omelet house over here!"}
{"text":"Fun place to eat breakfast. Great parking, good service good food and freindly people. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a very solid breakfast place with friendly staff. I personally don't think I can keep coming back because the checkout process is so painful. This is management making the decision that my time and my experience should suffer for their benefit.   Really unfortunate but with so many other breakfast and brunch options I am not willing to waste 15 minutes paying my bill everytime."}
{"text":"I guess I need to limit my visits to Sunday only.  The service was NOT good!  I was invisible the first 15 minutes I was there.  The place was not busy, and many dirty tables were not attended to.  People can't listen effectively.  I asked for an orange juice and water, I get orange juice, and coffee. I ask for wheat toast dry, and it's buttered.  I am spoiled on weekends, so I will have to find a new breakfast place on weekdays that will give me the service I deserve."}
{"text":"This place is simply AMAZING!  The food and waitress(as always)...PERFECT!  My sister was in town, and wanted to enjoy breakfast at her favorite place, and The Cracked Egg did not disappoint.  If you go on Sundays, get there before 8:30am.  The place is jam packed with a long waiting list by 10am.  They let you subsitute menu items, give you the best possible service, and food is always cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"This is a review for the Peanut Butter French Toast specifically. I've been to The Cracked Egg a few times before and really enjoyed ththis'd ops and the prices were very reasonable. This time, however, I was long happy with what I ordered at all. I strayed away from my usual eggs, meat, and gravy breakfast and tried the Peanut Butter French Toast. I was not impressed. There was not enough peanut butter, the bread was small and too soggy, and overall this French toast was just a horrible, dissappointing mess. Never again... Never, never again..."}
{"text":"So I had high hopes because this has 4 stars... I had the chicken skillet and the potatoes were hard and the chicken was dry. The Hamburger bread had a weird taste and the sourdough on the philly cheese steak wasn't even toasted. The food wasn't \"bad\" but I wouldn't be back"}
{"text":"Good breakfast place, always seem busy, but service is great.  Cannot go wrong ordering anything on menu, it all is good.  We haven't been to this one before today, but its part of the \"egg\" chain, and every time we go, we are never disappointed.   Today I got my usual omelet, the \"califorina\" with avocado, bacon, and cheese.  It was huge and cooked just perfectly.  Definitely will keep this on the breakfast list."}
{"text":"Service:  prompt and friendly.  Food: serving size was big but not too big.  Tasted nice.  Coffee was hot and well prepared.  Price:  Good for what you get."}
{"text":"Fav breakfast spot by far ! Vegas is kinda my 3rd home so i try to find places to eat and go every time i'm in town . i don't eat meat so it's hard to find places that cater to my kind as well as carnivores lol veggies for life"}
{"text":"Had this  place bookmarked for a trip to Summerlin. A great, fun breakfast place. Had two delicious meals, breakfast of course. The staff is courteous and friendly. The place is clean and comfortable. Not to be missed."}
{"text":"Love coming here with the hubby and the kids! The Customer service is always impressive to us each time.  Feels like family is catering to us.  I'm pretty sure we have been helped by every server now and they are all nice to us.  Definitely recommend this location for their hospitable service and food.  By the way the kick in potatoes with scrambled eggs   our kids love their burgers"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way back home (thanks to Yelp) food was good and service was fast. Coffee cake was the bizoomb. Seasoned potatoes were very tasty. My husband and Son both ordered the Big Bad Wolf omelet....if they had some New Mexico red or green chili this place would be excellent!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my third and last visit. Poor service every time, like they were short staffed.    The food was not tasty, nor was it attractive. In fact two hours after eating I was retching in the toilet. With continued problems over the next 48 hours.   Now I'm not not 100% sure it was their food, but the circumstances are very suspect.   Sad to post such a poor review."}
{"text":"Def the best place to eat breakfast in town. Always fast, always delicious, and everyone is always friendly. Prices are cheap for the quality that you get every single time!"}
{"text":"Visiting from LA and we have so many restaurant options so when I tell you \"This is a great place\"!!!!! It is for reeeeaaaall.  Had the pancake, eggs and sausage...and stole some hash browns from my sister. My gosh am I full. So ooooo happy tummy"}
{"text":"We've eaten here at least 20 times... Initially I would probably give it 5 stars but after going so many times maybe I'm just used to the great, fresh food?  Anyways, it's definitely one of our favorites for breakfast and I highly recommend it. Burgers are great and so is the huge Cobb salad, breakfasts are yummy too. The service is usually spot on and we've never had a complaint."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the fact that even though this restaurant was busy, my friend and I were sat within 5 minutes. Our server seemed friendly enough, but he barely came to our table, and didn't ask me if I wanted a refill on my coffee or orange juice. I ordered the short stack of blueberry pancakes, and when they came out they looked good enough, but were very bland to taste. They also weren't cooked all the way through. There was still some liquid batter in the middle. Maybe it was an off day since this place was packed, and seemed to have a lot of regulars. Maybe I'll try this place again, maybe not. I'm on the fence."}
{"text":"I LOVE The Cracked Egg! My husband and I drive 4 hours to get to Las Vegas for two reasons, the pinball hall of fame and the Cracked Egg. They have great service, delicious food that is always fresh and excellent coffee. Well worth the wait (which, if you have a larger party, will be certain)"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast ever!!! Pancakes are so yummy and they have a gluten free menu. Staff is great too. Its my favorite spot for breakfast in town."}
{"text":"I love this place! The blueberry pancakes are to die for. My order got mixed up and they came out with walnuts added! It was he best mistake ever! Who knew I've been ordering blueberry pancakes wrong this whole time! Huge selection and portions and great staff! Yum!"}
{"text":"Still my breakfest place choice maybe I'm partial since I live close by but Ive been to all the egg, omelet, maple places and still always prefer this place food is always solid and fresh tasting never had anything bad only thing service is kinda lax after the breakfest rush I always go around 11"}
{"text":"I went back again and it was just as good!  Only downfall...they don't have a liquor license, so no mimosas with breakfast.  They have outside seating, which I didn't recall but the seats look like the old ones at McDonald's that are stuck into the ground and swivel around.  I got the carnitas omelette with egg whites, so dang good! And potatoes with bacon, cheese, and sour cream for extra lbs! see pix"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot of all time! I have ate inside the restaraunt quite a few times but I only live like 2 miles away so I do to go orders a few times a month.   They really have some amazing stuff on the menu. It is worth checking out the menu before you go so you are prepared. I'm a simple guy so i usually get coffee, the cakes & eggs combo which is basically 2 large pancakes, 2 eggs and 2 slices bacon.   I've tried a few varieties of things other people with me have ordered like stuffed french toast of peanut butter, nutella. I've tried the eggs benedict, coffee cakes, biscuits in gravy, chocolate chip pancakes, etc. Really it is all very good!   The place is very busy on the weekends. I got to go orders in like 15 minutues but sometimes if you go on a Sat/Sun morning you could have up to an hour wait to get seated and it is not a small restaurant. Thats a good sign!   I think the only drawback is sometimes when I crave in the evening/night, they are closed. I think the hours are 6am-3pm which works for breakfast/lunch meals."}
{"text":"Order the huevos rancheros sans sour cream mi amigo.  Cream makes it too rich as it is already drowning in queso.  I get this every time.  A sure flavor explosion mejicano style.  Make sure to chose the coffee cake as your side of carb if you want to reach a state of bliss.  Coffee usually not as solid as I like so you have to request multiple cups.  Spacey service but eh.  Share all this unless you are a lumberjack or want a food coma en route to your hike at Red Rock."}
{"text":"Second time coming back to this place. Still great food and friendly servers. Just disappointed when I got my coffee cake. I was expecting like the one last time I got. It turn out that they change daily. The coffee cake I got it didn't look like one. It look like angle cake with cheery inside then drissle with sugar on top. I end up just look at it and observed the cake not eat it. Then I request for wheat toast instead.  So if you are a coffee cake lover like me, you can tell what one good coffee cake look like :) as far food, I had the joe's scramble. It's has ground beef with spinach and potatos. Delish! Very filling. Totally happy with it. Definitely will come back to visit the restaurant next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I got the stuffed raspberry french toast here, and an omelet, after hearing how great it was, and how cheap. Yeah, there is a reason they don't have their prices online. It was around 10 dollars for their 'stuffed' french toast. Let me tell you what stuffed means to them. It means two slices of toast with some kind of cream cheese filling spread in them. And where does the raspberry come from? The five raspberries they throw on top of it. But I could look past this, I guess, as their way of making stuffed french toast. I surely don't expect something like Ihop, since this is suppose to be 'home cooked meals'. But when your stuffing is so miniscule it's like you spread a small amount of butter on toast, it is very disappointing. Then came the omelet with the hash browns. It wasn't great. Not bad. But not medium either. The potatoes were ok, then again you shouldn't be able to mess that up, but the omelet was just....eh, I guess is the only reaction I had to it. For the prices and hype this place gets, I can't believe the food I got. I might give it another try, if I had a coupon or something, but other than that, I really would pass on it."}
{"text":"Well we decided to go here because we wanted to try something new instead of all the main food courts on the strip. Definitely a great place to go ans the workers were all around nice. Our server Liz was very quick and friendly. Little bit of humor as well which made it Kool when ordering our food. Food was amazing and perfect after a 5 hr flight. Definitely reccomend stopping there for breakfast ;)"}
{"text":"Hot and new place said yelp, I saw it and boom I had to go. So yeah... didn't expect it to be a whole in the wall place to be honest. The service here took awhile, for our beverages, order and the food. I had the vegetarian egg Benedict, It was mediocre. My eggs were overly cooked the yolk didn't break. Booo. The hash brown was really soggy in the inside. Over all.  I wasn't too fond of this plac, nor the food.."}
{"text":"OMG!  Food is a 4 OUTTA 5 stars but my service was amazing!  I get greeted at sat by a younger hostess.  Quite but polite and very kind.  But my server Diana is say bout 45 years old long pretty jet black hair pinned back cute pops over brings my coffee asks if I have any questions over the menu while I wait for my other guests.  I ask what she likes.  She gets so excited.  She asks are you in a sweet or savory mood.  She shows me her sweet picks then I asked ok. What's ur savory you have me wondering....she gets so excited and detailed on her choice and suggest to get the eggs pouched cause of how the yolk will melt into other toppings as I cut and get into my breakfast!  Seriously amazing service!!!!!"}
{"text":"Raul thank you for making my morning amazing from the silly jokes to your smile to the amazing customer service and the always incredibly hot and fresh breakfast!!!!!"}
{"text":"Enchilada omelet is outstanding! Flexible when I asked for a single pancake as well, coffee is good but they have nondairy creamer. The staff was prompt in seating me and the wait staff was friendly and responsive!"}
{"text":"After seeing the reviews from other people I had to double check if it was the same place I was at.  This place is horrible. Let's start with the drinks, I ordered water with lemon the lemon was slimey and mushy. My friends Sprite had something floating in it. I ordered scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon, sausage and the potatoes. Cheese wasn't melted , eggs were a little slimey and the potatoes weren't cooked all they. My friend ordered a ham and cheddar cheese omlet. It had American sliced cheese on the top and her potatoes weren't cooked either. She didn't eat it at all. I am a great fan of going out to breakfast but this is one time I should be just made it at home. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Got the western omelet and my boo got the big bad wolf. Highly recommend both. Sooooo good! Yes they are overpriced once you think about how much you spend versus how much it really costs to make it but your chances of it tasting like their breakfast is slim unless your a really good cook. Will be going back to try their egg benedict mmmmmmm."}
{"text":"My first time at this one. Greeter was sorta friendly. Our server was very friendly and accommodating. My breakfast was really good and fast but the bacon was a tiny bit undercooked but not bad. I forgot to ask for crispy. Overall satisfied with this visit here"}
{"text":"The food is good but definitely overpriced and not worth how much you spend.  My Cobb salad is over 13.00- are you kidding me? It's tasty and outrageously priced. They are a thriving business because of it,  but I feel like they should match the expensive price tag to a worthwhile meal."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday morning, and only had to wait about 10 minutes. Got a great table, and a great server! Don't remember her name, but she was so sweet.   The Veggie Benny was absolutely delicious! Loved that they had a vegetarian friendly Benedict. The coffee cake with chocolate chips was awesome, but   Great place to come if you're in town visiting and don't want to eat breakfast on the strip.   Service was amazing, food was good, but nothing too special."}
{"text":"Service was great Environment was awesome Oj was good  Seasoned potatoes were bomb  Definitely a great place to catch an American breakfast before heading home from Vegas !"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast yesterday, it was bad. My meal as well as my wife's and friends was microwaved. Yes microwaved. Which is odd. Went to the cracked egg on rainbow near buffalo and it was good. Everything was gross in this place. The potatoes tasted wierd like too much all seasoning was put on top. Gross and would never go to any cracked egg because of being scared of getting the same crappy meal. The funny thing this was the only bfast place with no wait and now it makes sense why."}
{"text":"My best friend and I stopped by for breakfast this morning and it was such a cute diner! I love the vintage feel, and the servers were super nice and welcoming! I had the chocolate chip pancakes with a side of eggs and bacon and they came out pretty quickly. The pancakes were soooo good I'd definitely recommend them!"}
{"text":"We met a couple of friends for breakfast here at the Cracked Egg.  This is a place they bring friends for the first time.  So, how could we say \"NO\"... I'm glad we didn't.  We looked over the menu and everything looked great.  I ended up with a skillet filled with pork.  Can't go wrong.  The bottom was covered with home potatoes then came the eggs and pork.  I decided to get toast as I knew I would finish Michele's coffee cake.  I would definitely come back again for breakfast.  Can get coffee cake with meal."}
{"text":"Great family place to eat. Staff is very nice and helpful. We had a problem with our name not being on the wait list and when brought to the staff's attention, they seated us right away. Would recommend this restaurant to anyone and will definitley be back when in the area. Food is great also and the menu has lots to choose from."}
{"text":"In deference to the prior review of a good friend who received poor service here in 2010, I'll say that I'm hopeful that they've at least gotten rid of her terrible waitress some time in the last five years.  After spending a few days in the center of the strip, we had a 1:10 flight out of McCarran to come home.  That gave us a perfect chance to have a nice leisurely breakfast.  After researching gluten-free options in the area (wife wanted more than a 'fruit cup', but didn't want eggs, yet ironically we still came her), I found The Cracked Egg mentioned at a gluten-free website we use.  A couple people had reported issues with cross-contamination, but the more recent mentions indicated less problems.  So, we thought we'd give it a shot.  Wife had a craving for simple pancakes with pecans (and of course syrup), which they could accommodate here.  They used \"Pamela's\"-brand mix, which we also use at home.  I'm going to assume they don't have a dedicated griddle surface, so if you really are extremely sensitive (wife usually is not), that may not work for you.  They also have gluten-free bread (but not a dedicated GF toaster).  The menu clearly states all this, and even has the heading \"Gluten Sensitive\" and not \"Gluten Free\", so we knew what to expect.  I'd seen a mention of gluten free English muffins in a prior review, but those were not available (nor mentioned on the menu) when we visited.  The gluten-free pancakes are quite large, and would have been $6.95 alone.  But for a little bit more, we ordered it as the \"Cakes and Eggs Combo\" for us to split, which added two eggs and your choice of meat (2 slices of bacon for me, obviously).  There was an additional $1 charge over the regular Combo price because of the GF pancakes, which I feel is fair, knowing the difference in cost between Pamela's and \"regular\" pancake ingredients.  It was plenty of food for the two of us.  We also picked up the breakfast of a coworker of hers, and even with three beverages, the bill was less than the celebrity \"burger, fries, and shake\" I had on the strip the night before (review to follow).  The coffee was good, and hot.  Add to that friendly and fast service (there was no wait at 11am on a Tuesday), and who am I to complain?  My pro-tip:  Sure, they have the fancy \"hash browns\", made of cubed seasoned potatoes, with bacon, cheese, scallions and sour cream.  But if you're a purist like me, they also have the crispy shredded potato version that I prefer.  This location is on the southwest portion of town, and as a tourist who had been on the strip for four days, a calm way to transition back to \"reality\".  Since we had a rental, it really wasn't out of our way.  Just go like you are headed to McCarran, and where I-15 hits the 215, go a couple minutes WEST to Rainbow Blvd. (instead of east to McCarran/rental car return) and it's a couple blocks north from there.  Took about five minutes to drive to the rental car return from there.  3.95 stars"}
{"text":"Our first trip & it was awesome! Our waitress, Cory, was super attentive and knowledgable of the menu. When I asked about the corned beef she assured me it was yummy and then went a step further and said if I didn't like it she would bring me something different! A+ customer service for sure. Honey had a \"big bad wolf\" omelette and it was perfect. The corned beef hash skillet was amazing - fresh cut corned beef cooked with the peppers, onions & potatoes. None of the greasy, overseasoning of most breakfast places. I did like the seasoned potatoes better than the hash browns. One of the highlights of this breakfast place was our toast. Pre-buttered, perfectly toasted bread & they had mixed fruit jelly. Truly awesome! If our next trip is this good, it will become a regular spot for us!   Edit: too good to be true. 2nd visit. Our waitress, Natalie,  is awful. Dropped the check before she asked how we are doing. Slow on water refills. It's crowded again, but not too long a wait. Monte Cristo is terrible. Cheese isn't even melted. Both ham and chicken are still cold. I may just be spoiled by better sandwiches I've had other places, but the potatoes are on point. Honey had an omelette again, but the almost $3 up charge for sour cream and bell peppers is saddening. Our birthday girl had plain buttermilk pancakes & she is chomping away. Overall, I'm sad this place didn't live up to our expectations from our last visit & we won't be back any time soon.   Gave it some time & gave them another try. This visit was much better. Coffee cake is great (red velvet) & our food was cooked perfectly. Our waitress, Andi, was great! Honey had the green scramble & he really liked it! Lots of veggies & th green sauce is awesome."}
{"text":"Came here this morning with a couple friends. They both got skillets which they enjoyed. I got a coffee and the steak and eggs breakfast. Eggs were scrambled and tasted average. The biscuit was HUGE and very good with the side of gravy I ordered. The hash browns were also very good. Our waitress was kind and the service was about average time waiting. The only downside was the steak... I asked for medium rare and it came out pretty much well done... I might be back but probably won't order the steak again."}
{"text":"Our favorite breakfast place, wish we didn't have to drive 30 minutes but it is worth it. The kids ask us at least once or twice a month if they can go!"}
{"text":"Always great. I have been going here for many years and it has remained consistently good. The Veggie Benny, Corned Beef Hash and Joe's Scramble are just some of the yummy dishes they serve. It is always busy, but they will do their best to get you seated ASAP!"}
{"text":"Andrew and I's favorite place. Our Weekend Rituals =) ( 15+ times) Coffee Cake is amazing..Breakfast is always a pleaser...but the Lunch is hit and miss, the side salad is HUGE and fresh! PS. If you sit at the bar (we usually do) the service is just a tad bit slower and you are tormented by seeing everyone elses food in the window =) We Love Cracked Egg!  Don't forget to ask for Erin! She is the Best and we love seeing her at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Love the egg whites scrambled with turkey and diced green chiles!  YUM!  The server, Juan, is fabulous!  ;-)    Will have to try other scrambles at future visits!  I'll be back! :-)"}
{"text":"The Montecristo is soooooo good! So many people have referred me to this place and it took me a while to finally experience it, but i was not disappointed. Their fries alone are killer. Must try. Decent prices and good service."}
{"text":"Best breakfast the west coast has ever seen.  From eggs and sausage, to french toast. Been going here for years and it never dissapoints. Everything is always fresh, quick and inexpensive. And their home fries are awesome!"}
{"text":"Still one of the best breakfast spots in Las Vegas. This location is in Henderson so if you live in the area or are just driving through the area, you don't need to look any further for a solid place to eat. This place is all about simple egg dishes, pancakes, french toast and coffee cake. Their homemade coffee cake is to die for when hot, so make sure when asked if you want toast or coffee cake you order the coffee cake.  I often get scrambled eggs, with home fries, and sausage patties here, mostly because it reminds me of how these things taste back home in New Jersey. The potatoes are seasoned in a spicy cajun mix which I really love, the eggs taste farm fresh and the sausage patties are always juicy and delicious.  If you are in the mood for lunch they also have a tons of salads, sandwiches and burgers to choose from. My favorite lunch items are the patty melt with pepper jack cheese or the tuna melt. Both come with a side (usually fries) and both were good choices. I still would suggest sticking to breakfast though, as that is their top specialty, not lunch.  The thing that puts this place on my radar besides the quality breakfast is the service. I've never had a bad experience with the service here after years of going on the weekends, weekdays, whenever. Keep in mind they are only open from 7am-3pm, so plan accordingly.   Like others have said, this is not the kind of place you need to go across town for, but if your in the neighborhood or live around the area, than it's worth trying out at least once. Much better then any strip breakfast you could find."}
{"text":"We come here often. The food and service is always great. I like the lighten up. My mother in law likes the veggie Benny. They always have specials. This morning my husband had the stuffed French toast and he said it was very good. We signed up for their mailings and we get coupons for $8 off. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"Very cute decor. Super nice staff. Good was absolutely amazing.  The pesto scramble was everything and the potatoes were everything"}
{"text":"The overall attitude of this place seems catering to an elderly consumer base.  They don't offer wifi and this is explained by a sign that says \"we don't have wifi, talk to eachother and pretend it's 1995, an obvious affront to younger more connected individuals who like to multitask while enjoying a morning meal.    Our server seemed timid though he did well trying to personalize our guest experience.   it could be argued that the entire exchange was awkward and lacking a sunniness that one might find in someone with more experience.  We ordered our food and had to ask for more creamer, even though we placed the empty creamer container on the edge of the table.    I ordered the low fat scramble and my partner ordered the veggie skillet.  I had the coffee cake as my bread and my partner ordered the sourdough toast.    The lowfat scramble was actually delicious.  I would recommend ordering it with no salt.  This is how I ordered it and the dish was delectable!  There was chicken and tortilla chips which were not crispy because they were mixed into the scramble.  Not sure if they were meant to be crispy but it tasted good the way it was served.  The coffee cake was not very good at all.  It was actually a cherry jam coffee cake with white sugar frosting.  I wasn't expecting this for coffee cake in my limited experience is a plain sometimes cinnamon spiced pastry to sweeten your cup of Joe.  I would not recommend the coffee cake unless you are a fan of highly sugary items and cherries.  I am neither.  My partners skillet was the most lacking of the breakfast experience.  Again, it's hard to know what happened, whether the small differences were by design, the effect of a new or bad cook, or simply just a bad day in the history of the cracked egg.  For instance the seasoned potatoes were cold and seemed pre-made.  They were dark with seasoning even though I requested light seasoning.  The broccoli which came in the skillet was seemingly steamed, but the spinach was not.  So there was a mix of different cooking for all of the ingredients and it was off putting.    Also my toast was cooked fine.    We ordered a waffle for the table and it came out soft and light. I wanted it cooked more but I didn't want to bother the waiter.  He asked the table next to us if they wanted their coffee to go, but once he gave us our check, he never once checked on us again.  We asked another of the wait staff if we could have our coffee to go and she brought us huge Styrofoam cups full of coffee.  Not what we asked for.  But still cool.  But a little excessive. But a nice gesture.  So anyways, we got a good experience in the end but not without some effort on our own part which somehow defeats the purpose of \"service\".     When we finally told the hostess who was checking us out, she showed no remorse and offered no apology.  She just handed us our receipt and was over it.  Over all, we felt that the prices we paid did not reflect the quality of experience we received.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Gluten free Pancakes and toast. Sold. I'm a regular. Just ask for the special menu and you'll find almost all omelet and skillet choices are gluten-free."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that should be your usual spot for breakfast or brunch.  Everything is the way I expected.  I ordered the build your own breakfast skillet and it is simply delicious.  I love their seasoned potatoes and of course, nothing can go wrong the the eggs.  I will go there again and again."}
{"text":"OHHHH EMMMM GEEEE!!! I had the best breakfast this morning at the Cracked Egg..It was D-Lish! Their skillets are really good and that coffee cake is AMAZING! Not too much food and wasn't too pricey either. A great place for breakfast, its a little small, but you always have the option to eat outside. I must try people!!"}
{"text":"Ok so food was decent. I had the carnitas omelette. Carnitas had good flavor and they use an excellent brand of cheese. Hash browns were a bit under-seasoned an limp, so ask for extra crispy if that's your thing, and go with some salt. Pumpkin coffee cake was good, even if the rumors are true that it's from a box. It was gooey and moist and delicious. Coffee is decent too, though not super strong. Service was very quick, once we were actually seated. (see below)  Major downside...we came on a Saturday morning when there was obviously a crowd waiting, which was fine. We were told the wait was about 30 minutes, which was fine. We went outside because it was a bit crowded inside. After about 15-20 minutes, we got a little chilly and came inside. We were told there were some benches around the corner from the hostess table, so we went and sat down. Another 30 minutes later, I decided to check I see how far we were on the list, since we had been there for close to an hour at that point. The hostess showed me her wait list, which revealed that our name had been crossed off long ago and that at least half a dozen people had been seater after we should have been. When I pointed to my name, the hostess said \"Oh, well I called your name.\" All I could say was that we had been right outside and then inside on the benches around the corner. She did seat us pretty much immediately at that point, but did t seem the slightest bit apologetic that we had been skipped.   Overall, good experience. Just maybe don't go during peak hours to make sure you don't slip through the wait list cracks."}
{"text":"Tried the Cracked Egg in Summerlin today (close to home) the breakfast was good, my wife ordered the ruben nothing special. Decor is good, clean. Overall just OK, I think if I'm going pay $10-$12 per breakfast I'm going to stick with the the Egg and I, or Bagel Cafe."}
{"text":"The wait staff was okay, but the food was pretty gross and over priced for what you got."}
{"text":"I came here because a lot of people I know say it's a good place for breakfast. It's decent at best. I'll give you the rundown.   First: If you come here on a weekend, expect a wait time. My husband and I had to wait 10 minutes for a seat, which honestly isn't terrible...but still meh. There are cool little stores nearby to kill a few minutes in.  Service: The service was good. That was one thing I enjoyed about the place. Our server was ready to recommend items and substitutes for entrees at the drop of a hat. In fact we saved a little money from it. BONUS!  Price: This area made me sad. You get a lot of food, yes, but everything was overpriced. I got a Joes scramble which was about 10 dollars. I could have made it at home for a fraction of the price. Their coffee is 2.25 for a cup. OUCH. I'm used to being kind of tight with my money, so everything on the menu made my wallet cry. Especially since you can make a lot of it at home.  Quality: The quality of the food was good. On par to what you would expect from a restaurant that specializes in breakfast. The portions are good and everything is well cooked. The eggs are fluffy and the potatoes weren't overcooked.   Overall: It was a decent experience but once was more then enough for me. There are other places to go for a good breakfast and that cost half as much. I suggest going there once to try it and judge yourself."}
{"text":"I love this place, especially because I love eggs!! I usually go for the biscuit and gravy one with the potatoes , it is so good. Very rare that I make it around opening times, but when I can it doesn't dissapoint. I heart Cracked Egg"}
{"text":"The Greek Omelet with seasoned potato's is my favorite here.  The staff has always been friendly and polite.  They have several locations in the Valley, the one on GVR Parkway is just as good."}
{"text":"The service was great the food was not up to par I had a breakfast Mexican burrito it was not what I was expecting it was salty on the inside the hash browns were very orally I did not enjoy my breakfast"}
{"text":"We came to this place since Mr.Mama's was very busy. The restaurant environment was a bit crammed in. We both ordered breakfast the portions were large and the food quality was good. It however lacks class there is nothing that makes this place more distinguished from the other thousands of diners in this country, that's why I'm giving it a 3 instead of 4"}
{"text":"Came upon this place while looking for gas.  Good spot for breakfast.  The coffee cake (cake) was very good.  I liked the potatoes.  The fruit plate is unique.  It was pricy for breakfast but the food was good."}
{"text":"A good place for breakfast food with eggs pretty much any way you like them and coffee cake as an alternative to toast.  I had the El Vaquero omelette with chorizo this morning and it was excellent.  However, I sat at the bar and tired of watching all of the front of the house staff eat and or drink beverages in between serving customers.  Also, you pay your bill on the way out and are expected to stand in line in the doorway with the customers waiting for tables.  If they address both of these glaring service issues it will enhance the overall dining experience."}
{"text":"Croissant french toast was nothing better than regular french toast. In fact I like it less because the croissant is smashed completely flat and is actually dense with very little flavor. The coffee cake is usually the saving grace, but not this time. We got the last two pieces according to our server, and they were very dry and kinda tough. This was.the only.time of many that I left there disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a great little breakfast spot. The omelettes are huge and loaded with fresh goodies.  Feels like an old diner where people have been coming for years.  The coffee here is the best in the city and the coffee cake is to die for.  Friendly servers and a comfortable atmosphere makes for a nice laid back breakfast.  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the scramble and those seasoned potatoes!!!  The service was great too!  Wish we had one of your restaurants in the Long Bch, Ca area"}
{"text":"First time coming here. i brought my wife and her friend. We all order different food. we were all disappointed. We came out there to get off the strip and have a good breakfast. It was all just average. I was very surprised we didn't love it. I looked it up on yelp first. it had 4 stars out of 299 people. I get there and parked and was a little skeptical because it looked like a strip mall. But then i get to the door and see all the awards and all the pictures of all the people that votes them the best food. We get our food and it was just average. I wish i would have went to black bear diner, egg and I or omelet house. But i know now. The food just didn't have much flavor. Im usually kind of picky but my wife who usually doesn't care said the same thing."}
{"text":"With an average of $12 a person for Bomb breakfast, Erin, she is the best customer service I have received in Vegas this week. The food ranges from breakfast to lunch and portion are great for my 265 pound self. Loved it all and will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to have breakfast. Food was excellent. Portions were good sized. Service was great. Even though it was crowded when I arrived I was in and out in an hour. A little pricey though."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place with generous portions.   Service is just ok, especially since it wasn't too crowed.  Country potatoes are yummy!! Will be back"}
{"text":"No doubt about it, I love breakfast, and the Cracked Egg is a reliable go-to for me on my side of town (Northwest) and in Henderson.  Because I joined their Roaylty Rewards program last year and am such a regular, I get an $8 gift certificate in the mail every month to spend.  Armed with this month's certificate and famished from a long swim workout, my recovery breakfast this morning was the Garden Patch omelet, hash browns, and the coffee cake--oh yeah!  If you order the coffee cake instead of toast, it will be brought to you first, like an appetizer, but I saved it for dessert--yes, you can have dessert at breakfast!  Customer service has always been top-notch and I've never had a bad meal yet.  And, with my certificate, I only had to pay $5 for my meal, including the tip.  Thank you and keep cracking those eggs!"}
{"text":"I went to this place with my son and my husband.  The place was packed!! I had never felt more uncomfortable in any other place I have been to.  I had never experienced someone treating me differently because of the language I spoke.  I was speaking to my son in spanish when the waitress came up and she rolled her eyes.  I asked her if she had a problem and she was like \"no, what are you going to order?\", I ignored it and ordered some food.  By the time it got there my son was getting antsy and all the staff ( the waitress, hostess, manager) were looking at us.  I asked the waitress to wrap up the food to go cause I hate listening to children cry when Im eating and Im sure other people do to, so I was going to leave.  The manager came up and asked if there was a problem and I said no that my son was just antsy, the waitress and hostess laughing in the background looking at us.  I then said to the manager how uncomfortable it was how everyone was treating us.  He followed by saying  'I don\"t believe they would do that, I wouldn't allow it.\"  I said \"I am not asking you if you believe me or not I am telling you what happened\".  Long story short, we left.  The food I ate in the car sucked, seriously not just cause I was upset.  I have ordered food to go from mimmy's for breakfast and it kicked ass this was just bland!  I would recommend Denny's over this place."}
{"text":"This location needs some serious fixing.  I walked in around 12:15. Table for one. I was greeted by the busser who took my drink order,  only to deliver half of a drink...really?? And then 2 male waiters who kept infoming me my waitress would be right with me. Around 12:25 she took my order and noticed my drink was empty. It was now 12:50 and still no drink refill no food no service just a bunch of eyeball waiters looking at me as if they were scared to aproach me and help a team member out  at 12:51 I walked out!!  Called the front to let them know I left due to...No drink, no silverware, no food and definitely no team work.  Hope they fix this problem."}
{"text":"So I really love this place!!!!  I come for the jalapeño bacon,  I also get ice coffee and there creamers are so good but the best part of coming here is...my suprise.  Everything I order I get coffee cake and it changes constantly so it's like a suprise, my special suprise...and they are always delicious   #crackedegg #coffeecake #breakfast"}
{"text":"Good god this food was GOOD! Only a slight wait when we got there in the late morning for breakfast on a Saturday morning, but the food was SO worth it.  Not big on service, but that's not why you go here.  I LOVED the extensive Gluten Free Menu and was thrilled to death.  One of the only GF options for breakfasts I've ever been to and I was so excited to find one while we were in Vegas on vacation! Would definitely recommend and return each and every time we go back! A ways away from the strip though, drive, as the taxi will be $$!"}
{"text":"Ok,  I'm irritated.  I eat here once or twice a week and have nothing but good things to say about the food and the service. I asked for a little salsa to put on my scramble and I get a little,  maybe 2 ounce cup of salsa.  Nothing special,  just to add a little flavor.  I get the bill and its $1.50 for this little bit of salsa.  Fine,  if you want to charge for it,  then say something! And I can see 50 cents or something,  but $1.50? And just slipping it on the bill without saying anything? Come on.  I don't own why this irritated me so much,  but it did.  I just looked at my receipt from last week when my girlfriend and I went and we both got little salsas, and sure enough, $3! Not cool"}
{"text":"HISTORY/DISCOVERY I discovered I was gluten-intolerant this past year and it has made eating out difficult, especially when most of my favorite foods have become my worst enemies: bread,  pancakes, waffles, pasta, etc. With this current news I have been on a hunt for GLUTEN FREE items, and The Cracked Egg is a stellar winner!  The gluten free pancakes and other available options here allow me to order my favorite meals and enjoy a quality breakfast meal. The gluten free pancakes here are DELICIOUS and taste like the real deal. The omelet was very good and they even accommodate gluten free toast, which also, verrry good! Solid selection on the menu.  4STARS the only thing preventing this from being 5stars for me is the extra charge for gluten free is a little steep. Sucks to pay extra for having allergies, but I really appreciate the availability and the service we had was really excellent. Waitress was very sweet, helpful, and courteous. Experience was flawless, pricing was a little high."}
{"text":"Chicken enchilada omelet.  The best omelet I've had in a long time.  Love the cherry coffee cake."}
{"text":"Big fan!  Been here about 4-5 times, the food and service are great.  Love this place!  The portion sizes are spot on and there are plenty of choices for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is your typical greasy american style grill diner breakfast place.  Given that there are no other close breakfast place, you take what you can get, but it is still a disappointment given all the other rave reviews.  Let me start with the coffee cake.  Please don't order this.  It is made with a generic white cake mix that is not even very good mixed in with some cinnamon mix and white frosting.  Actually, it is pretty gross to eat for breakfast.    You know there is a question of quality when all of the menu items are put in \"quotations\".  Enjoy the \"Fresh-squeezed\" OJ as long as you realize it may be fresh squeezed, but it is the worst quality and cheapest OJ they apparently could get their hands on.  We had a variety of breakfast items including french toast, pancakes and some special \"hash\" item that is supposed to be a specialty.  I wouldn't order any of it again.    On a positive note the service was excellent and someone in our party got a hamburger (for breakfast??) but at least I can say everyone at our table really enjoyed the french fries.  Again, at a minimum please DO NOT order the coffee cake, some of the worst breakfast sweets I have ever had anywhere."}
{"text":"Well done, basic breakfast place. Very good buttery hashbrowns and fluffy pancakes. Prices are a bit high but portions are generous. Would have given 5 stars but a glass of apple juice (from a bottle) is $2.80! Insane. Nearly 6 bucks for 2 apple juices. You have been warned."}
{"text":"One of my family's favorite places for breakfast! Super good food! If you are going on a weekend, it will be packed. The lunch is great here too, I'm a big fan of their salads. They are huge!"}
{"text":"Great experience!!!  The service wasn't the best, but it was super packed with Zapponians on a weekday morning to be fair to the workers.   I ordered the Californian Omelette that had bacon, avocado and jack cheese... so good. Be sure to order the seasoned potatoes! They put this cajun seasoning on top that's making my mouth water right now.. My friend got the Cracked Croissant and that looked even better my omelette, definitely have to order it next time.   Zappos employees really hyped up the coffee cake but I found it too sweet to enjoy for breakfast, I'll probably go for the toast or other choice next time.   Great for breakfast and brunch, I'll for sure be back to try more!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit pricey for some eggs. The service was outstanding. The only problem I had was they seated us next to the toilets.  A man went in and had well, left the worst smell while we were eating. It was So disgusting.  The food was plentiful but nothing special. The coffee cake wasn't bad, I'm pretty sure they microwave it to warm it up.  The facility was very clean."}
{"text":"Talked to the hostess about how long it was going to be and she was very rude. It ruined my morning. Maybe I'll comeback..."}
{"text":"You walk in this joint and think you are going to have to wait forever as it is not a very big place, but probably because the service is quick and food comes out fast the turn over is not as long as it looks.  The skillet breakfasts are the best.  I had the veggie skillet and got it over tomatoes rather than the potatoes and it was great.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service and food was great but it was a disaster when it came to paying. You pay at the hostess area. The credit card machine broke and I was waiting for 20 minutes for it to be fixed. They held my credit card hostage and wouldn't let me go get cash. They handled the entire situation extremely poorly. No one apologized for the situation, no one cared at all that this happened. They just started helping everyone that had cash while a lime started building for people with credit cards.   Once it was fixed, they helped every person in line except me. I was trying to get their attention because they were holding my credit card this entire time. I was seriously going to leave without paying because the service was so terrible I didn't want to give them a dime, but I couldn't because they were holding my card. I'm not even upset that the machine broke and the wait was long to pay, I'm just really pissed about how this was handled and how no one apologized or gave two shits about the customers. Not to mention the hostess screwed up the transaction of the guy before me and put someone else's bill on his card that was much hire than what it was supposed to be.   I hate to be a jerk and write a bad review for this place because the food is great but this specific situation handled poorly."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Cracked Egg in the last 3 weeks.  Both times the 3 of felt that while the food was good the portions size was lacking for the $$. Ignacio had the eggs benedict and there was as most a couple tablespoons of hollandaise sauce spread across the tops of the two soft poached eggs.  Of course when he asked for more a nice portion arrived. Uriel had a chicken wrap and again while good it lacked a decent amount of goodies inside.  I had the Corned beef Reuben and again lacked a nice amount of meat and even kraut, also the rye was not well toasted. We will  probably try here again for breakfast as the service was great and friendly."}
{"text":"Great place for an after ride revival! The staff went out of their way to get our larger group of hungry cyclists seated and served . I have to say... the service great and the plates  generous and tasty. Love the Sweet Potato Skillet!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. My usual is an American breakfast, but my friends have always complimented the taste and quality of other dishes."}
{"text":"Yelp Challenge 2016: 07/365  After a wonderful rest at a buddy's home... My brother and i were starving. Granted my brother has to work, i'm here in vegas to rest before tax season madness begins. Regaining my vigor after my health setbacks.  I dont know if its my looks that made the people be rude... Ah what the hecks...  Decor: It is nice.  Service:  I like to do live yelp tips/updates because at that initial moment, the experience is pure. Over time, human nature allows exceptions and logical reasons why people act the way they do. I dont know the waitresses name so i just snapped a pic of her (upload later but its in the tip section). She was extremely rude, rough, and rigid at first. This already ruined our experience!!!!   My brother is like Maila. Both of them will privately air grievances and just relents with the shittyness that is unjustly placed before the... Good for them i will publicly air my grievances. And if i dont directly say anything to them + remain quiet... I am done, best to remain silent. Done deal. Will never return. So why two stars?   I dont know what happened. My bro thinks my live tip was read. The waitress showed another side with amazing service but my mouth was already ruined and im extra assholey when ravished. Jesus is merciful, i am not jesus. A rebellious sinner at its almost finest. And the coffee cake was superb. Bomb diggity. If the service started out prestine along with coffee cake this would be five stars.  Food. Commercialized. The egg white veggie ommie with green chilies was good yet not great.   Brother hates toasted toast and wants it lightly toasted. More so warm soft bread. They burnt the bread and he was peefed. Why not ask for another? Cause the the waitress was a complete bitch and we wanted out at this point. Waitress decided to become nice after we began eating.  Hash browns were undercooked. Whatever. I shouldnt be eating this much starch anyways.  For this joint's sake, i hope our experience was an isolated one. Considering all the eateries for us Non-Vegasians to consider, i will not be returning ever again."}
{"text":"Good Food, a bit over priced I feel for what you actually get not by much though.  Always very busy though.   Food is consistant.  Nothing amazing but a nice breakfeast place, probobly have to wait if you go on the weekend morning though"}
{"text":"Seriously this place is overrated. It is just a so-so breakfast/brunch spot. I took two groups of students out to breakfast on two different days and tried the waffles one morning and the omelet the next. I was not overly impressed and the students were polite enough not to complain and look a gift horse in the mouth, but no one (and this was a sample of over 12 meals) was raving about their food.  There are not many options outside the Red Rock, but if I ever go again I will definitely try to find something better."}
{"text":"On of my favorite breakfast spots in town! So glad there is one on the Henderson side, as the only one I used to know was way north west.   Cracked egg has an interesting variety of egg options and fantastic pancakes. On top of the Joey Scramble I just had to try the Oreo pancake special. It's loaded with Oreos!!!!!  Of course there was no way I could finish all of this so I took it home and it tasted just as good the next morning!  Can't beat the cracked egg with their specials, skillets, and salads!   Service is always just fine, food is prepared quickly and it's always clean."}
{"text":"I've heard good reviews but not got a chance to go until today and it was lovely. I personally think the prices are a little higher than say like IHOP or something but not too high and you definitely get your money's worth (I could not finish my food). The cake was yummy too nice and warm saved mine for after but was too stuffed so will be warming up and eating later. My only complaint was that it was pretty warm in there but I guess it's expected because it's not very big and the kitchen is right there. Overall a great breakfast spot"}
{"text":"One of my fav restaurants on this part of town. Unfortunately, they are only open for breakfast and lunch. Their homemade coffee cake is like legalized crack - can't just have one slice. The BBQ Chicken Salad is yummy. I usually have then bring me extra BBQ sauce for dressing. Both food and service is always great!"}
{"text":"This is THE best place for breakfast in the whole Vegas valley! The hash browns are a taste nirvana, crisp and golden on the outside, tender and buttery on the inside. My usual is the garden omelette, veggies are always cooked perfectly, never limp, and always the perfect amount of cheese, never overloaded and greasy. The ULTIMATE, is the country fried steak and eggs, like mother's milk to me.  I saw Gary Oldman eating there a few months ago. Surreal. What he was doing in a local eatery in Henderson, I don't know, but it must be a testament to why this place is so damn good! Don't forget to sign up for rewards card."}
{"text":"I hightly recommend this place for anyone who enjoys a nice, filling breakfast like myself. My first time coming was 10:30-11:00 am and it was a full house but didnt have a long wait time to be seated. Nor was it a long wait to be greeted and for our food to come. The food was amazing, very filling, nice amount for the buck. My wife got biscuits and gravy and could not finish the plate, but did enjoy every bite. I got chicken fried steak, absolutely wonderful. Very satisfied with my decision to come and the employees were great. I WILL be coming back"}
{"text":"First time here. Decided to yelp breakfast after our Red Rock hike. This breakfast/lunch spot is amazing with great customer service. Corey treated us so well great service. I ordered the bacon, cheese, avacado omelet which was delightful. I also made sure to order the coffee cake which was highly recommend on yelp ITS A MUST TRY. HAPPY EATING ENJOY."}
{"text":"Small place and busy but definitely worth the wait.  Most waitstaff is very friendly, food is amazing, gluten free options are terrific, and it's right down the street; we come about once a week."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! We've been coming here for years. We love the food and we love the staff. This business model is a winner and keeps the customers coming!! Excellent everything, thank you!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best breakfast spot in Vegas! They have a bunch of convenient locations around town and their food is amazing. We average one trip a week, and the service is always friendly and attentive. Both lunch and breakfast, we have never had a bad meal there!  On Tuesdays and Wednesdays they have Chicken Tortilla Soup on the menu. GET IT! It's quite possibly the best soup I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Gr8 breakfast menu and delicious coffee cake. Creative egg dishes, Mexican breakfast and tasty pancakes.  Service is good, generous servings, and roomy tables and booths. Fresh squeezed orange juice and a variety of fresh fruit.  Lots of sides and gr8 coffee."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went there on a weekday after 12 and still had a 15 minute wait.  But it was worth it.  The cake was brought right away and warm which was a nice touch.  Her egg croissant sandwich was big.  She couldn't eat it all.  My eggs with spinach and feta cheese was very good.  Can't comment on the potatoes, but daughter liked them.  I would give 5 stars but the coffee wasn't flavored.  Still I would recommend eating there!"}
{"text":"4/15/17: update- They have obviously hired new staff since my last review. This staff is very much improved and in tune with the prompt, speedy service that most people expect anymore. The kitchen also did a great job with their timing as well as offering a couple of new daily offerings (blueberry coffee cake & red velvet coffee cake) as well as a few daily specials (red velvet pancakes, Mexican benny, ham melt, & pastrami omelette). The food was cooked great, the drinks were refilled timely, the server checked back regularly, everything went great! A much better visit than ever before. Great changes.  2/16: Food was fine, but service was GREATLY lacking, especially with only a few tables being seated. Couldn't get refills for coffee, no follow-up once food came out at all. Ordered food To-Go & it came out very early & in a complete mess. I would have ordered something more, if I could have gotten any attention at all. I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Pancakes & French Toast YUM!!! That alone makes this place 5 stars....PERIOD!! Well - 1 star for prices."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places to come to when in Las Vegas. They know what over medium is for eggs and well toasted for the toast means. Been coming here for the last couple of years since I found it on Yelp."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places I have eaten at. I come here every time I am in Vegas for business. The prices are reasonable and the food is really good. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good place to have breakfast."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Server was on point with refills and checking up on how my meal was. My orders came out very quickly(5-7 minutes or so)Hash browns were cooked perfectly, not soggy in the middle like a lot of other places. I had the el vaquero omelette and it was delicious. Orange juice full of pulp just how I like it too. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Great selection great service and most of all very tasty food from breakfast to lunch items I will defiantly come back next time am in town"}
{"text":"I love eating here, the food is always good and hot. The service is nice and place has a homey feel. We eat here at least every other week and signed up for their card and receive monthly  coupons."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review for this place .. since most of the servers that work here are amazing .. (previous experiences) this last visit May24 We decided to bring all my family that was visiting from California to have  a \"Good breakfast\" first of all we get a server that seem like she had a rough night ..not the usual server .. fresh attentive .. First of all when she brings our coffees I noticed my cup has BRiGHT red lipstick stains ..How can you miss that .. when you are serving a fresh cup of coffee?? just that grossed me out but I was ok with her exchanging my cup .. second she brings the toast.. for everyone in the table .. well our toast was filled with mold ..yes MOLD .. the people that are preparing the food have to be blind to miss the mold when spreading butter on it .!! Honestly the server didn't seem shocked just took the bread came back with more bread -and whispered sorry and continue serving .. Food didn't have any flavor no salt no pepper no nothing .. I was embarrassed that I brought my family here ..  nobody (Manager) bother to come to our table and apologize.. they just brought the ticket back making sure the 18%gratuity was included for 6 of us.. I don't mind the tip if it was a good service and enjoyed the food .. Is just that  this time there was no reason to tip ...  keep your eyes open.. this experience got me thinking how many times we've been to this place and wanted to vomit inside my mouth .."}
{"text":"Service is exceptional! Food is great! This is our (my wife & I) new spot for BCC-breakfast, chat, & coffee."}
{"text":"*military discount in uniform only*  Dumbest policy ever.     Went on 9-13-15 around 12:30 PM for brunch.    The wait was pretty long...which wouldn't have been so bad but the foyer of the restaurant is like 5 square feet so most people had to wait outside or huddle together. I was getting sweaty and hangry by the time we got a table.    Once we were seated it got so uncomfortably hot in there...I saw one poor woman asking for more napkins to wipe the sweat off her forehead.  The backs of my knees were dripping sweat down the booth.  I checked the thermostat and it said 84 degrees.  How's about some nice hot coffee and some hot pancakes while you sit in this sauna?  No?  Me neither.    Once we ordered the food was there in literally 3 minutes.  How did they make it that quick??? I gotta say, the food was amazing.  $13.67 got me two eggs scrambled, two sausage patties, coffee, and two huge blueberry pancakes.    My friend had a skillet and I tried the potatoes...mmmm....yasss....the seasoning on them was like Doritos.    I would come back here when the weather gets cooler because the owners are obviously too cheap to turn up the a/c."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Our waitress was nice. Prices overall are on the high side. Coffee cake was tasty and quite fluffy. Will we come back ? Eh. Probably not. There are a lot of other less pricey options out there with good food and good service. For the folks that like outdoor seating, this place has a nice outdoor area."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food. I love their menu - they have a huge variety of dishes, for meat eaters and veggies alike. Not just typical diner fare but fun stuff with chiles, protein focus, etc. the Cracked Egg even offers coffee cake instead of toast - they deserve all the props because of it. Yum!"}
{"text":"Just okay. Ordered to-go, asked the girl (Kelsey?) if the cheese on the Chicken Philly was provolone, she said yes, but it was cheddar. Put the pickle right on top of my fries, very soggy by the time I got back to my office to eat it (across the street). Might try breakfast another day, but certainly won't be doing lunches here in the future."}
{"text":"Just, no. Go to Egg Works. Everything but the coffee cake was gross. The coffe cake was awsome."}
{"text":"It was okay. Portions are really big. The coffee cake was good. Had an omelet potatoes & croissant French toast. Potatoes were ok. Nothing special. The croissant French toast wasn't good. It was really flat too. We will be back for the omelet."}
{"text":"I'm not a morning person, period, but all this week I've had to get up at 4:30am. Today, I decided to come here because I doubt I'd have another perfect chance. Upon entry, I had to wait a few minutes before I was acknowledged. I asked for the patio because it was early and it wouldn't be so hot (this was about 8:20am).  The hostess was polite, sure, but nothing super friendly. Oh, EVEN BETTER!@ The waitress! Omg, she came with her notepad and asked for my order, the end. I thought she had a grudge against me or something. I got my check super fast so I also felt like she wanted me to leave asap. She asked if I needed a box when she gave me my check so I don't know if I looked like I was ready to leave or if she was mad that I got the patio and she had to walk out to check up on me or something.  The food was decent; the portions were big (for me). I got 3 sausage links (they also come in patties) and lots of hash browns and my 2 eggs. They also offer you the seasoned potatoes if you don't want the hash browns. You also get another side and I chose the coffee cake. It was bitter, but not that shabby.  I signed up for their loyalty card in case I ever needed it. Maybe I'll try another location to check up on service. This third lady (I got helped by 3 people total) looked like she was the owner or manager or someone of that level. She was much more friendly and she processed my loyalty card and gave me points for it without me asking for it since I had forgotten about handing the card over to my waitress.  Overall, I hope I get better service if I get the chance to eat here again."}
{"text":"Lovely little place in the Green Valley part of Henderson. Very popular, I hear wait times are common. They told us 20 minute wait time for a table... It was more like 7-10 min. wait...  That was a nice surprise. The food is good, your standard diner type breakfast and lunch... Except kicked up a notch, 2 of us had breakfast, 2 of us had lunch.  Everyone enjoyed their food. You can get their famous coffee cake as a side... When in Rome... So ordered it... Came out looked okay... Nothing special...Till you took a bite, It was moist and delicious!!  Would I go back or recommend THE CRACKED EGG??  Yes probably, if you want a decent burger, omelette or other diner type food it's worth a try..."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been enjoying breakfast at The Cracked Egg for a long time! We had one close to our old place and now we are less than 5 minutes away from this one. This is not my favorite location, but the food is definitely good.   As everyone has already pointed out, the coffee cake is fantastic. It is not exactly what you think of when people say coffee cake, it is more like a white cake with some fruit filling on the bottom and some delicious frosting on top. My only gripe is that I wish they told you what kind of coffee cake they had that day and that there was just a little more fruit filling.  We usually end up getting a skillet, but they also have delicious pancakes! I am in love with the Kicking Potatoes, seasoned potatoes, bits of bacon, and melted cheddar cheese, served with a side of salsa and sour cream. I also like the option to make your own skillet and if you are in the mood for veggies, the vegetarian skillet is a fantastic option. Most of the skillets also come with coffee cake, win!  Now, I am usually very satisfied with the food, but have received spotty service from this location. Nobody seems too happy to be working here, from the hostess, to the waitstaff, to the manager. I have even seen the manager take on a customer who had a food allergy and was very specific about his order, which they messed up. I don't think it is ever OK to argue with a customer, especially in this situation where it could have gotten really severe if the customer had a life or death allergy. There were quite a few people in the restaurant and the loud exchange was certainly avoidable, I think a sincere apology would have gone a long way. I was also present when they messed up a rather large take-out order for some of my fellow team mates at work and didn't do much to rectify the situation.   I also really dislike the fact that you have to take your check up to the cash register. That area can get very congested in the morning since it is also the hostess station. If you manage to fight the crowd and make it to the register, I find it quite uncomfortable that they ask you how much tip you would like to leave. I don't understand why they can't just let you fill out the receipt like every other business. Overall, the food is good, but don't prepare to be WOWed by the service."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place for the price. I reserve 5 stars for only the best of the best. But you can't go wrong here for your straight up classic breakfast dishes.   I got the GVP omelette huevos rancheros style with re fried beans and salsa.   Even the waitress was like: Damn. That's a good order.   ;)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in town. Food is always great. Servers are always busy but still give you the right amount of attention. South shore scramble is my every time meal. Loaded with bacon. (Get it without chicken it's better). Come here twice a month at least and always enjoyable. Any mistake in order usually comes from a busy kitchen but is fixed quick. Definitely refer for breakfast/brunch. Never order lunch but doesn't mean it's not just as good. :)"}
{"text":"Eggs over cooked,  bacon under cooked,  French toast cold... Waiter makes excuses instead of taking ownership.  A simple I'm sorry goes a long way.  So leaving hungry and completely dissatisfied! Last time I'll be there. They can keep their rewards card. Waiter completely blew it!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food and they always have coupons in the newspaper. I always get the North Shore scramble or Heurvos Rancheros. Yummy place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great breakfast here at the cracked egg. I visited twice in 3 days. My first visit consisted of coffee and eggs Benny with home fries. My second visit was even more delicious and consisted of a country Benny with home fries. You are wondering what a country Benny is... well a country Benny is a biscuit instead of English muffin, sausage instead of Canadian bacon, and Sausage gravy instead of hollandaise sauce.  Simply amazing!  Cracked egg for the win The staff is very friendly as well.  Cheers"}
{"text":"This review is a month over due. This was may first time in this chain. I have seen these in San Antonio but never stopped. We had a good breakfast. When you go during the rush expect delay's like any place. Service was a bit slow but we had a wait for our table. Since this is a chain I can only write about this location, but I hope to write about other locations in the future. Everything had a good taste and I would definitely go to this location again. Eggs cooked properly. Potatoes were good, seasoned just right."}
{"text":"My favorite little omelette place in town!  My grandpa and I are regulars here and we can't get enough  We come about once a week and just love it, always a new kind of coffee cake, and every time it's delicious  very good customer service aswell"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this Cracked Egg restaurant, the hostess passed us over and put another white couple in our booth.  When we questioned her she spoke so softly you could not hear her.  So we  had waiting longer to be seated . THATS , THAT WHITE ENTITLEMENT  BUT I AM TREAT AS IF I AM SECOND CLASS CITIZEN AND MY BUSINESS IS NOT IMPORTANT, WHY? The manager was very apologetic, and offered to discount our meal.  She stated that this was her best hostess and this was her fault.   The manager and the waiter we had made the experience much better, and we will come back.  The manager came back to see how our meal was, it was great.  I appreciated that!"}
{"text":"Haven't been seated yet but just a suggestion.... Maybe you shouldn't seat a party until the ENTIRE party is here. Been waiting for a table while 1 man sits at a 4 top waiting for the rest of his party to show... For the past ten minutes by the way."}
{"text":"We've been going to Fast Eddys for over 10 years and a few times since it has new owners and is now The Cracked Egg. NEVER again will we be going back. Grilled cheese had no cheese on it after waiting over 10 minutes for our food. Waitresses were too busy \"gossiping\" with the regulars about staff that had been fired for lying and not showing up for work to take care of the customers sitting there! Ice cream wasn't offered and when asked as walking out she said \"do you want some?\" (Ice cream comes with the meal!) Owner/manager (?) was also very busy chatting and didn't seem to care about the patrons. WE will never be back there again - not worth the frustration of sending back a grilled cheese and being treated like crap. The quickest service we received was the bill!"}
{"text":"Had brunch at the cracked egg and it was great! Came in and had to wait about five mins or so for a booth since it was busy. After getting seated we ordered drinks and skimmed through the menu. Thanks to Yelp pictured I already knew what to get. My daughter got their waffle with berries and I got their croissant French toast. While waiting for the food we noticed the decoration. It's pretty homey if you ask me. Sort of a model home type of design to lure you in. The food came shortly and it was tasty. Nothing super amazing but it did hit the spot! Oh and if you have an entertainment coupon book don't forget to use their buy one get one free ticket."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch with the family; place was packed and noisy.  Their menu was extensive offering everything from your typical eggs sausage and toast to omelets and sandwiches.  I ordered the eggs Benedict which was not bad, but nothing special either.  Service felt rushed too.  I'll be going to sunrise cafe next time around"}
{"text":"This place is always awesome for breakfast, i have a wonderful experience every time i go. Their coffee is pretty decent, and you can even ask for flavored creamers. The food is always fresh, and the portion of avocado given when you ask for a side makes me happy. Even on busy days we can get seated very quickly and they servers are usually pretty good at attending to our needs! Their kitchens are pretty quick so you don't usually have to wait for very long to get your food after ordering."}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg is THE BEST breakfast place in town. I've been coming here for the past 8 yrs or so and the staff is always on point. The fresh yellow carnation flowers on the table give it a friendly welcoming feeling as when you visit your friends house who lives out in the countryside. The food! The food always exceeds my expectations. I have NEVER been disappointed with any plate I have ever ordered and I'm the type of person who ends up ordering the same dish at a particular restaurant because I hate to feel disappointed with my order. I don't have to worry about that when I eat here. Chili skillet is my absolute favorite, but the Chile Verde is bomb! Stuffed avocado is delish, monte Christi is sweet and savory mixed to a perfection.  A must visit restaurant that will keep you coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Super busy when I walked in but was managed well. Chicken fried steak is my weakness in breakfast resturants and this one was on par."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday morning for brunch with my family and waited about 15 minutes to be seated. My son got the little chicks meal, my boyfriend ordered the Mexican skillet with a side of buttermilk pancakes, while I opted to try the corned beef hash. The food was good and our waitress was friendly. My favorite dish that we ordered was the Mexican skillet,  next time I would skip on the corned beef hash."}
{"text":"First time here. Went Sundays of all Sundays-Easter. Didn't even wait 5 mins.   My boyfriend ordered the Montecristo. Very good! I ordered the peanut butter French toast. Very good as well.  Can't wait to be back in the area again, to try something else off of the menu."}
{"text":"This place is alright. The prices are sort of high. The food was good but I like the other breakfast places in town. Hey were busy and we had to wait a few but it seemed like most of the people didn't know what was going on. We were seated on the back side away everyone it was tight but it worked. The waitress seems to be bothered when we asked her for items and changes with our order and trying to get refills took forever. I think they need to rethink their processes with people and customer service. We weren't even there on a busy day. Probably will not return due to poor customer service and the prices are too high. I'll go to my other breakfast place where they are a great and enjoy their customers."}
{"text":"Every once in a while I have this crazy craving for EGGS. This visit, I was on the hunt for an egg scramble.   I have been here before but never really pleased my palate. This time, I would like to say that I was very happy and full (for the entire day) with my meal.   I got a scramble... Lucie's Scramble! Made with 3 eggs (yikes!) sausage, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms.... with 2 slices of giant muenster cheese melted on top! Not a single ingredient was lacking, and the portions are nothing short of plentiful. Yum   I wanted to change up my order and avoid the coffee cake and seasoned potatoes (which are good, but distract me from my main meal). Went with the hash browns and toast, and I think I will followup on my decision next time. Yes... there will be a next time, regardless of the spotty service.   As noted in previous reviews... service is a little on the off side, but not BAD. The food is totally worth it. Can't wait for my next breakfast outing."}
{"text":"Placed a to go order for the Lumberjack. Can't really complain about the food being cold because I didn't eat it on the spot. The food simply wasn't tasteful. Everything was bland."}
{"text":"There's a lot of potential for this place to have four stars, and I just might have to up my review the next time around when I return here and browse through the variety of breakfast items this place truly has. While I did arrive with a large group one Sunday morning and the wait was nearly 35-45 minutes for us, they did their best to accommodate us in the same section near each other.  I went with the veggie skillet, might I add was very tasty (I was able to get choice of how my eggs were cooked, as well as toast to go with). It was delicious, and what I thought was a \"healthy alternative\" probably wasn't because of the excessive amount of cheese that was packed into it (not to say I don't love cheese, but next time I'll be sure to request to tone it down a little more).  This location was extremely busy the Sunday morning I went, and because of such the service did take longer than usual. While I won't hold the service against that because it was busy (and knowing how that gets from working in a restaurant industry), I'd definitely like to return here to see what else there is to try."}
{"text":"The coffee cake is amazing.  Otherwise? Well.... it was fine until the last few times.  My family and I love it's convenient location and, due to the coffee cake, we frequent there at random intervals. Sometimes my husband and the kids and I, sometimes just my sister and I when she's in town.  However, any time they sit us in the back, the service goes DOWNHILL, VERY fast. I recommend you insist on sitting in the front in order to get decent service.  On top of that, something was particularly odd yesterday and I doubt we will be going back after this incident. Now, my sister and I ARE large women. So booth, though we CAN handle it, isnt exactly the most comfortable. Most times they ask us and we take whatever we can get because usually the place is so packed and we want in bad enough that we take booth or table, whichever comes first. However, yesterday, the place was relatively empty, but instead of asking, the guy who seated us just shoved us into a booth in the back, while several tables were open in the front. I guess we werent pretty enough to sit in the front?  Let me explain how us in a booth works. I sit in the corner (being the smaller of the two), then the booth table has to be angled, pinning me in, so that she can fit to sit.  A table was sat down about two or three minutes later. Our waitress tended to them first. I guess she didnt see us. She then rushed over to take our order. I requested coffee. She says \"yeah, but what food do you want?\", rushing us through making a food order. So... we did. We hurried up and ordered food.  So... she brings coffee and cocoa for myself and my sister... then the coffee cake a few minutes later. After a time, they then bring our breakfast.  I take two bites of my breakfast potatoes and then she's already bringing us the check! It took longer for her to bring us coffee cake than it did for her to bring us the check after bringing us food. Truly... I had a pair of sunny side up eggs that hadnt even had the yolks broken yet when she's pushing the check on us already. I turn it away and carry on my breakfast. Several minutes later, she comes BACK with the check! I again turn it away. By this time, I notice that the man who seated us is talking to the waitress who tends the front, and they are pointing at us and talking in great length about us (It's OBVIOUSLY about us). He then proceeds to sit at the end of the counter (we were in the corner of the back where we could be seen from the front if you were at the counter) and ate a meal... staring at us the whole time. It was SUPER awkward. When the waitress pushed the ticket on us the third time, I got the message and left over half my meal there, taking the hint and getting the hell out of there.  I'm not sure why they wanted us out so bad, but fair enough... we wont be returning. Too bad. The coffee cake is REALLY good."}
{"text":"Bad service today - 5/22/17, 6:30 am One server handling at least 7 groups/tables. My French toast was served cold. It had been ready, I saw it coming out from the window when it was done from the kitchen, but it sat there for a good 15 minutes before it was served. The coffee was not fresh, too. Disappointing today... :("}
{"text":"Went to mario batali's @ the palazzo the night before and this place whipped his ass.  The food was awesome and out of the kitchen in about 4 minutes."}
{"text":"Yelp helps again!   I was in the area a few weeks ago with a buddy of mine and we needed some breakfast before heading out for a day of adventure.   We scanned yelp and it told us about the Cracked Egg.   We got there a little late, around 9:30 on a Friday morning.   We were promptly seated and received oj and coffee.   I ordered Joe's scramble and my buddy ordered an omelet.   Both were really good with large portions.   One thing they do at the Cracked Egg is to add cream cheese to the eggs to make them a little smoother and richer.  It's a nice touch if you like cream cheese.   The only complaint I have is they forgot our toast.   But the portions were so large, we really didn't miss the toast.   Also, the place was a little noisy due to a party of six celebrating a birthday.   But other than that, it was a nice place to grab some breakfast.    Will I be back?   Sure, I could see myself going back at some point."}
{"text":"Chose the counter for lunch and needed service faster than what a table might provide.  I am diabetic and needed some lunch.  Sat down and was able to quickly give my order to the counter waitress.  I did a glucose blood test, estimated the carbohydrate count for my selected item, put the numbers into my insulin pump, and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Finally a guy from the kitchen brings a meal only to be told by the waitress rushing to his side, that it is the wrong order...she incorrectly had provided the wrong item on the chef ticket.  I was about ready to say that that was fine...I'll take the corned beef instead of the pastrami sandwich, but she whisked it away and was gone.  She said it was her mistake and a pastrami would be out soon.  So I waited.  And waited.  And waited.  I stood up to go and she came running out saying it was not done on purpose.....What?  Why would she say that?  I left and quickly made it to another egg house on the same road.  Bye Cracked Egg - You will not be seeing me again."}
{"text":"Thanks for a great find yelp. Looking for something new in our hood and this place came up. Chicken fried steak was on point! Friends with me said biscuits and gravy was awesome and so was the meat lovers. They need more reviews. Fast, friendly, clean and great food with an affordable price. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We had heard the place was remarkable.   The place was packed.  Recovering from a bachelor's party from the night before (don't let your mind wander - it was playing Super Mario Bros. in Mount Charleston until our eyes bled), we needed a place to sober up, but we only had an hour before we had to head off to work.  When we walked in, we told our hostess this time constraint.  Her reply?  \"Oh, that shouldn't be a problem.\"  So what our hostess didn't tell us, after seating 4 additional smaller parties, that there was a boisterous wedding brunch on the other side of the restaurant and that our table would be greeted after the (one of two) servers was finished taking their order.  So they failed to communicate, but we'll have to deal.  After all, we had heard the place was remarkable.  After 23 minutes without a \"Hello,\" and a waiter serving all four of those parties sat after us, the five of us started to get up - it's not a dine and ditch if you don't receive anything.  Only then did a waiter (casually chatting with a cook) dashed madly to our table looking suddenly concerned.  We rattled our requests off, and 40 minutes later we got our food.  I do remember the food being above par (after all, we had heard the place was remarkable), but the service left such a bad taste in our mouth, I will not step foot in the location again.  Small cups and no refills didn't help.  Short-staffed?  Sure.  But we would liked the heads-up on that one before we sat down under a time crunch.  After all, we had heard the place was remarkable.  Stay away."}
{"text":"This is a little hidden treasure that I wish so many people didn't know about. You have to get here before 9 am or you will wait to be seated.  Great hearty, home cooked style and taste to their dishes. The Country Benny is a flavorful biscuit topped by a sausage patty, a poached egg, and a delicious sausage gravy. It is absolutely delicious!!!   Their corned beef hash is the best I've ever had!!  The service is good. The only bad thing about this place is it needs to be bigger.  It's definitely worth getting up early for!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, came out quickly. Love the spot its at. Only downfall was our waitress was horrible. She seemed like she didn't want to be there never checked on us, and just overall sucked. Other than that no complaints :)"}
{"text":"It was fine.  As a rule, I am suspect of places that purport to \"smother\" anything in sauce.  The staff was great, though, and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"I have been to the cracked egg several times. it is a fantastic place to get breakfast. It costs about the same as chain places but, the quality of food is far superior.  This is one of my favorite places for breakfast in Henderson.  It is noisy but, that is just because it's so busy. It's busy so, expect to wait for a bit for a table. I've never had to wait longer than 20 minutes.  And it's always well worth the wait.  yummy!"}
{"text":"Very homey atmosphere with great country style cooking. Our waitress Erin was awesome, quick, personable with a great personality!"}
{"text":"This place is bad. The staff is so unfriendly and the food is mediocre. It thrives simply because if its location. Egg Works is a much better choice."}
{"text":"I don't know how to put it as I was trying hard to work on giving this place a high review. We came in here with the high expectation as it showed on Yelp as a \"hot and new place\". The wait staff were very friendly and nice and the place looks like an old diner decorated with vintage style signage.  The waitress was a sweet older lady that was very attentive to helping our party of 5.    Then came the food....my friends ham looked and tasted as if it were rubber and might have been a little undercooked. I myself ordered the Blu Cheese Burger.  When my order came out the fries were the cafeteria type and not very tasty.  The burger lettuce was yellow and the tomato looked tired. I thought to myself, I can move that to the side and just just eat as it.  When I bit the burger, it tasted like really stale cheese....yuck...four hours later I still have the after taste in my tongue. I think they are trying, but idk if I will come back."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, but I can't give them five stars because of their prices.  For the food and portions, I truly feel they are overpriced.  I am a frequent diner and I do have my favorite items, but I tend to visit when I, or someone in my party has a coupon because of the prices. There are several businesses close-by and they don't offer any type of corporate discounts, which is surprising.  I think if they added this \"perk' their business would get crazy busy.  Overall, I have no complaints about the food or service, and I recently brought my family from out of town in to enjoy an outstanding breakfast here."}
{"text":"Service was awesome! Thank you Amanda!!! She is the best sever ever!! Food was dank! I would come back in a heart beat"}
{"text":"I will start by saying that our party of 2 was sat very quick on a busy Father's Day. Our drink orders were taken right away but we sat for a while before any one took our order.  The place was packed and there were screaming kids everywhere. Our server was very friendly but the food was pretty bad. My husband compared it to cafeteria food. I agree that it seemed like typical Las Vegas food that you would get at a local video poker bar or casino cafe.  We ordered breakfast by the way. Steak and eggs and the croissant sandwich."}
{"text":"Super popular place on a Sunday morning!!  We waited 30 minutes for a table for two.  We did experience friendly service while we waited though :)  Once we were seated the service was quick and efficient.  I had the vege benedict.  It was good.  Decent place and will try it again in the future."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast spot in Vegas. The staff is always amazing, the food is always on point. It a small place, so there is generally a wait, but worth it. Everything is homemade & delicious."}
{"text":"The food is always good & the berry salad is my absolute face! Monica the manager is so nice & pretty! :-)  I want to go at least 2 times a week!!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Had country fried steak with hashbrowns and 2 eggs. Also a side of bacon and hot chocolate. Pretty busy area but did not wait very long. Our server Nicole was very nice and came back to make sure we enjoyed our food. This place is a bit pricey but I did enjoy my experience here and will come back again!"}
{"text":"I think this place survives due to its location. Our third time here and the entrees don't look or taste like anything beyond what you can do in your own kitchen. The coffee cake isn't worth the calories. It tastes like a boxed mix over a layer of jam. I will say the servers are nice and prompt. The food isn't anything  to write home about."}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend and decided to go on yelp saw this place with three stars.  The food tasted packaged the cut seasoned breakfast fries were tasteless n hard, food was cold and just plain no taste at all I would not return here again. The service was good.  We saw 11 people seated at a table that should have had 8, these people are paying customers n you squish them in to seat them, if I were them It would have not been acceptable."}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant.  Been to another location with a better dining experience.  I don't mind waiting for a table, but I do expect decent food and service.    The wait was over 30 minutes.  We weren't told that the counter was first come, first serve however. I guess not too bad for mid-Saturday morning.  The waitress was extremely rushed.  I asked if the corned beef hash was chunks or minced.  She said small pieces that are minced.  I watched the cook divide a plate of eggs into 2....not what I want to see.  The corned beef was strips.  I tried to eat it anyway but it tasted watered down...no flavor.    Very loud, small environment.  Not what I was looking for at all.  Much better breakfast options in town."}
{"text":"Tried The Cracked Egg this week with my manchild. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the new place in that old space was pretty good. We are happy to see another decent place for our late breakfasts back in the neighborhood. I had the benedict with veggies (spinach, mushroons, onion and tomato added avocado) and he had the big meaty breakfast with country potatoes. Both were delicious. Staff was friendly and helpful. If you are looking for diner decor, this might be your spot.  Sadly, our meal was interrupted by a dazed jaywalker outside.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and pancakes were huge but I was put off by the servers eating in the corner between tasks. They were using their hands rather than utensils and didn't bother to sanitize or wash up afterwards, which seems insanitary."}
{"text":"This is a diner style setup. Home cooked food. Not bad. Just average. Nothing better than you make at home. Nice staff."}
{"text":"Its was the Saturday before Mothers day and my Florist still needed an hour to finish my order so I walked across the parking lot to the Cracked Egg.  It was late morning/very early afternoon and the place was packed. The entrance isn't designed too well as today you had to wade through a crowd to get to the register and ask to be seated or put your name on a list. When its time to go you have to wade through that same crowd to pay and then again to exit.  I know bars/clubs put in focal points to force patrons to mingle with eachother or to create the appearance of the place seeming \"hot\"  I just didnt appreciate the experience this early and espically to get a couple over easy eggs.  Simply stated the store is just to small for a restaurant this popular.  The food wasn't bad but my Mexican/Jalapeño dish was lacking in flavor and that is impressive as you really have to work hard to kill the flavor of a Jalapeño.  The service was pleasant enough but once my food was delivered I didn't see my waitress a single time (she gave me my check with the food) and nobody else stopped by to check on my 3/4 empty soda so it was a good thing my jalapeños weren't spicy or flavourful.  I love this franchise but would recommend going on a non rush/less busy time so you can enjoy your food prepared with all the spices and ingredients they deserve and not be ignored.  Parking was a little tight as well. The store is located in a business plaza and not designed for easy in and out or for large hungry crowds."}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS always busy, so be prepared to wait a little (especially on weekend mornings) but it is seriously worth it. The decor is so warm and welcoming, and the service is always good. Breakfast food is usually breakfast food, but I actually CRAVE this place, its so good! They have a big menu too, so there's always an opportunity to try (and love) something new every time you come. I've been to two of their other locations and it's consistently good with great service at each one. Don't go to ihop, go to cracked egg instead!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Service was decent, food was okay for the price. There are much better choices for breakfast. Great red velvet cinnamon roll though!"}
{"text":"Ok, so the food is great here, I have possibly the best club sandwich here with avocado and over easy eggs, but the service is like winning the lottery. Host is super friendly, I live less then 5 blocks from this place so we wish we could go more often then we do, but everytime we go, we remember why we don't. The servers are cranky, and slow, they forget half of your order and if they think your a new face they lie to you and tell you that they are new and they are sorry,  I've came here a handful of times in the 2yrs I've lived here, and its the same thing everytime. I'm a server myself and I try to be understanding of somebody else's circumstances, but all I can come up with in this place is that these ladies are bitter, old, and stretched far too thin, I'm gay so its not about the looks trust me, but a little personality, sense of urgency, and a side of manners go a long way. Guys its time to let some of these ladies retire and hire more servers to handle the work load that they apparently can't handle without being weeded. I'm here right now and this lady has 3 tables, me included, and she's running around like she has 15 tables. I get it, they are old and need the work, but bring in help for them at least and put more on the floor, because your service is lacking for it."}
{"text":"The hostess staff are friendly and nice.. The service good,, the food served hot and fresh.. I have not had a bad experience or a unsatisfactory meal.. Will be back again"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here during our recent trip to LV and it was so amazing.  I had the eggs, cooked perfectly and biscuits and gravy also wonderful. But first came the  little bit of heaven warm coffee cake.  If I lived here I would eat here all of the time.  The waitress was very friendly and very prompt with refills. The Orange juice was the tastiest . I have heard the wait time is usually lengthy but we went during the week  and got seated quickly.  This breakfast tasted like a good old fashioned southern breakfast.  Yummy."}
{"text":"Love breakfast all day and all the gluten free options.  Scrambles, omelets and skillets are delish!"}
{"text":"I made the mistake of ordering Joe's Scramble thinking It might be a close relative of San Francisco's Joe's Special. Think again. A thick layer of cheese, microscopic bits of spinach, possibly some ground beef, a paltry amount of scrambled egg, no seasoning...... Forget about it!"}
{"text":"I love grabbing brunch at cracked egg with family. It has a great family setting and good food!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places. I think the food is amazing and menu options are very creative.  I do hate the long wait.  Do try their coffee cake and delicious omelettes.  I give this place stars for creativity and food."}
{"text":"We love the Cracked Egg for breakfast / lunch! Usually a wait no matter when we visit but never to long and they have a great rewards system which mails us coupons.  We sometimes get breakfast but we love their burgers. My wife thinks it's the best burger and it is her must when she wants a burger. She made me try it many months ago and now I end up ordering it too when we go.  Compared to the other breakfast options in the NW, we think the Cracked Egg is the best!"}
{"text":"The cracked egg is my favorite new breakfast spot. I love all the options, you can order just about any egg plate your mind can think up. I love the southwestern green chili scrambles. Their daily complimentary coffee cake is amazing, I especially love the peach."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, have seen this place busy every weekend so decided to come in, never again. They are very over priced. They use frozen diced potatoes and smothered in gravy means a very small dab, if you want more it will cost you. Waitress never even asked if we wanted more coffee. The only good thing was the coffee cake. Find somewhere else, this place is not worth the hype"}
{"text":"Just moved to the north west and came to try the cracked egg with my family it was an awesome breakfast experience. Great kids menu. An awesome selection to choose from breakfast classics and lunch and there eggs Benedict is amazing. It's a must try in the north west and we'll be coming back on the regular for breakfast."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service from the hostess to the server on a busy holiday morning. Fast, genuine and attentive. Food was warm with nice presentation. Frequent checkin's with \"Is everything OK?\" Scrambled eggs, omelettes, skillets, toast and potatoes all just right. Hot coffee kept coming. My out or town guests felt well taken care of and were impressed with portions and service. We lingered and tipped well as compensation... server came back and thanked us."}
{"text":"Love The Cracked Egg!  We visit every few weeks! I have two go to choices... I always order the Eggs Benedict or the Biscuits and Gravy- both are wonderful choices in my opinion!   The staff is always very friendly and attentive!   I always look forward to coming back for more yummy food!"}
{"text":"Ok so this is my first time being here, pass it all the time but have never stopped until I read the review of a fellow Elite Yelper and said ok it's time to try it. So it's a diner type place, my son and I opted to eat at the counter, I really hate taking tables for us two when there are larger parties waiting. The staff truly is so friendly and on top of things! As I sat there I saw a lot of customers stopping saying hello to waitstaff who knew them by name etc... a lot of regulars here and I can see why! The portions are huge and prices are great. I had the chicken fried steak, home potatoes and biscuit and eggs, my chicken fried steak was crispy and covered in gravy, the potatoes were good my biscuit I honestly have not had it yet, I brought it home as I just could not finish my food. My son also could not finish his food, but he said it was good. This had a very home cooked feel and I truly appreciate that. I like that this is not a chain type of place and it had such a welcoming feeling. I will definitely be back and quite honestly it's about a 30 min drive for me but I'd even make that drive opposed to something closer mostly because the staff was awesome and the food was good... now if your expecting fancy this isn't it but this works for me!"}
{"text":"The food is good. I wouldn't say it's fantastic, but I end up eating there at least twice a month. It is a bit pricey for breakfast/lunch food but is very convenient. There is not much else very close to that location, and no matter how busy they seem to be I get seated quicker than I would have guessed. I have never had bad service, and it has always been clean.  For any vegetarians out there, I would recommend the \"veggie benny\". If you're not big on sauce, ask for it on the side."}
{"text":"I. Love. The Cracked Egg.  It's such a cute little breakfast/lunch stop! You can never go wrong with a home-y feeling restaurant! I usually come here with my boyfriend for breakfast. They're always busy but we usually get sat within 15-20 minutes. People are in and out! I am always greeted with awesome service and the vibe is such a family and home-y atmosphere. I really enjoy getting the nutella stuffed smores french toast. TO. DIE. FOR. I've probably gotten it like 5 or 6 times already! They also have some of the best seasoned potatoes in town. One of my absolute favorites! I also really like their omelets. They're super hot and fresh and you can make them however you want or they have a few you can choose from. I like The Denver! I've also had their skillets, DELISH! I always have a hard time choosing what I want to get. I want to try their whole menu because everything looks so good! Eventually I will be able to get to that point, but for now I have stuck with what I know is truly my favorite. The french toast. Go ahead, try it! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"NOT worth the money or the time. Second time there. The first time, the service wasn't so great, but the food was ok, so me and the hubby gave it a second try.. BAD idea. We will not be back!!! Took almost 15 minutes for someone to ask us if we wanted drinks. Which in my eyes is not good customer service!! I got the Veggie Benny and the avocado was black. GROSS.. My hubby got some egg sandwich, which was a sloppy mess.. GO TO EGG WORKS on Sunset!! Customer service there is an A+ I give Cracked Eggs customer service a C and that's generous!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast for the first time here the other day. A very pleasant atmosphere to dine in and eat. The Decorations sure give a good complement to the place. I had a Denver omelette with there freshly squeezed orange juice. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that would love to have a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Always such a treat getting a quick simple and fresh breakfast here! My wife and I love this place ! Number one go to for breakfast and they have a few locations as well! Staff is always so great and attentive ! Good comes out quick and hot!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the crowd is out of control.  It's a wait to get in and you feel crammed in.  There are way to many tables in this little joint.  The service comes around as fast as they can, but if you look spanish (which I do even though I'm not Spanish at all) you may wait a while.    I thought it was just me, but I see that someone else has had the feeling that they are not wanted there.  I got a few looks at first, but when the waitress came and spoke to me and my vocab was better then hers I got better treatment.  Anyway, the food was okay.  No better then any Denny's or IHOP I've ever been too.  You have more room to eat, a quieter meal, and better service at IHOP.  Sorry, but it's the truth.  But if you like a room filled with noisy loud people(Like high school cafateria loud), this is the place for you."}
{"text":"had high hopes for this place as the reviews from yelp brought us in. came in for 11:30 and had to wait a couple minutes for a table, no problem. we were seated rather promptly. we were waiting for a couple friends to join us, so our waitress brought us water. all seemed fine. then we decided to order biscuits and gravy to start our meal before our friends arrived. the order took forever, over 20 minutes. our friends had arrived, we were able order our meal and have a decent catch-up conversation before realizing our stomachs were still grumbling because our biscuits hadn't arrived. finally our biscuits arrived, just a few moments before our meals. unfortunately, it was inedible. there was no taste, no flavor and the gravy was gloppy. out breakfasts arrived and nobody finished their plate. overall the service was slow and the food was not very good. we all left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"We make special trips here when staying in Vegas.  Particularly love the corned beef hash and chile verde rancheros.  For the most part it is typical breakfast fair, just done better than most other places."}
{"text":"Food is decent quality.  Brunette hostess was very rude and ruined the experience.  She refused to smile and pretty much threw the pen at me to sign my receipt."}
{"text":"Food isn't too bad, but the service is pretty terrible. The two times I've come here, when I walked in, there was no one there to greet you or anything. There was someone at the register, just minding their own business, not paying any attention to the people who walk in the door. No sign telling me what to do... \"Do I wait to be seated? Approach the person behind the register?\" Seat myself??\"  Once seated, the water and coffee (although coffee pot and water pitcher were only 20 feet away from us) took way too long to get. The server seemed so very apathetic about everything. No urgency whatsoever. Honestly the service would be the biggest reason I won't be coming back. The food was okay, but not totally worth the price."}
{"text":"My favorite thing here is the coffee cake. They have different flavors all the time. It just depends on what they made the day you visit. I've never had one I didn't like. Today was cinnamon apple..my favorite so far.  The menu has a wide variety of items. Everything is reasonably priced and the quantity is large.  If there is a wait, don't be discouraged because it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"We joked that the giant menu wasn't big enough... meanwhile I couldn't see my husband behind it when we opened it up. Haha! The atmosphere is casual and relaxed. Nothing fancy here. We went during a weekday morning so it wasn't busy, just a few frequent visiting locals and us. Service was quick and courteous. The food portions were big and tasty. Glad we chose this location for breakfast before our busy day."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday morning around 11am only about a 15 minutee wait for us.  Omg the coffee cake...  make sure everyone in your parties gets something different so you can try it all!"}
{"text":"I love this place! If you are gluten sensitive this is the place for you, they have a great gluten free menu."}
{"text":"I love this place! Prepare to eat as the food will definitely fill you up. Coffee cake reminds me of my east coast childhood. I say hash browns over potatoes but both are definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"The standard that all other breakfast/lunch spots need to aspire to. Plus, their gluten-free blueberry pancakes are amazing!  I do wish that they had a decent waiting area though. The patio would be perfect if there was shade or heat, depending on the season."}
{"text":"This place just feels like home. In every good way possible. I have been going here for years and I won't stop any time soon. The food is great.. Breakfast AND Lunch! The reason I go back, is the service. It's the same employees time after time with wonderful service. They remember you, sometimes your order. They don't rush you on busy days. The food is always out in no time at all!   Order the kicking potatoes with 2 scrambled eggs on top and a side of salsa and sour cream. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Yummo! We went on Saturday and I expected a wait but it wasn't too painful lol.  My boyfriend was raving about his dish and was still talking about it the next day. I had eggs with cream cheese and scallions. OMG!  SO good.  But I also have to say that our waiter JUAN was awesome!  He totally knew his stuff and anticipated our every need and was just perfect! A real professional and makes us want to go back! Thanks, Juan!"}
{"text":"The Cracked Egg is always a solid choice for breakfast. Nothing outside the box here but you'll find a typical breakfast and lunch items to choose from.  Recently came lunch with some coworkers and was happy to have the option to select a breakfast entree to enjoy. The omelette was well-cooked and they accommodated all my requests."}
{"text":"I only ever seem to end up at the Cracked Egg with a coupon in hand. The breakfasts are always solid. Not my favorite in town, but they have quite a bit of variety and it's all pretty good.   I have tried a number of things over the years and I tend to prefer their savories to sweets. Coffee cake isn't my thing, so despite all the raves, I have never ordered it more than once. The omelets usually draw my attention and they are good and cooked to order. Service is friendly, but the restaurant gets pretty busy so be prepared to wait or arrive early on weekends.  None of the dishes have stood out over the years, but if you're looking for a basic breakfast stop, this is as good a place as any, just make sure you have a coupon."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had breakfast here the other day.  It was very hard to understand the waitress.  The bill came to $27.00 for greasy hash browns and omelets that looked like you stepped on them...... they were greasy as well. We sat in a booth that was so small and confiming.....and we are both normal size.  We will not be going back....ever"}
{"text":"My go to place for breakfast in Las Vegas.  Good prices, good food, and most importantly for a place with this name, good eggs.  Nice quiet area and right off the highway.  Even with construction on the road, it is still easy to get to.  After being there again, everything I said before is confirmed and I will be back again.  Great food!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Overall, just average for my taste buds. Had chicken fried steak and eggs. Gravy was good. Wife had tortilla Ranchero something or a rather. Again, not bad, but not great."}
{"text":"The food is alright, upset they do not serve any sort of Salon.. not too many healthy choices. Good for a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"Get the rewards program. Best breakfast in town. Eggs anyway you want. Substitution welcome. Great service."}
{"text":"Pretty much an A-OK experience all around  Food: the coffee cake really was the star of the meal. Hot, fluffy, and flavorful. Extremely cinnamony. Was gone in a second. Veggie benny was pretty good, though I tend to prefer my poached eggs more gooey than completely runny. The hollandaise was not too heavy. The hash browns were crispy on the outside / tops and bottoms, but somewhat soggy in the centers. The chicken-fried steak was perfectly crispy on the outside, and the gravy was good. I'm not sure what all the hullabaloo about the seasoned potatoes is - ours were hard, dry, and extremely salty.   Service: came right at lunchtime on a Saturday, but managed to get seated right away. Service started out great, but after the initial greeting, any time we needed anything we had to flag down the waitress. The only time she spontaneously stopped by was to drop off the bill, about 5 minutes after the food came out. Upon checkout, if you pay with a card, the hostess asks if you would like to add a tip to the card. I find this incredibly uncomfortable and puts pressure on patrons to tip maybe more than they normally would. I would much rather have them include a tip line on the receipt so I can tip as much or as little as I would like without feeling guilty or embarrassed. Maybe they do this on purpose to help their waitstaff earn more money in tips? Next time I will bring cash to leave on the table instead."}
{"text":"The food was good, I wouldnt say it was the best, but it was good. I ate everything (the meat lovers plate) and was fully satisfied.  The restaurant itself looked like it was recently renovated which was pretty awesome. It was very clean and very bright, which is very surprising considering most diners that I've been to are generally very dark and cold. I do wish the coffee was a little stronger, but overall it wasn't terrible.   I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"At the end of our Vegas trip, we wanted a decent breakfast spot away from the strip because all the good ones around the area were packed. This place was recommended, so we decided to check this modern breakfast spot out. I only wish that this place was closer to the strip. I guess that's why it was so easy to find a table to fit our group of 6 right away.  Food: 1) Coffee Cake was fantastic! The coffee cake here deserves 5 Stars. It was freshly baked, soft, moist, and perfectly sweet. I would actually make a pit stop here just for this if I'm driving to and from Vegas http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cracked-egg-las-vegas-2?select=6Nzg1wAdBviOQNXVmfXlkg#oZXMxk_GLSoepyhkWveiJQ  2) Country Benny - Biscuit split and topped with patty sausage, two poached eggs, and smothered in gravy. I liked the gravy because it was flavorful and had a good consistency (not too watery or too thick). The eggs were poached well and the seasoned potatoes were so good!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cracked-egg-las-vegas-2?select=6Nzg1wAdBviOQNXVmfXlkg#V-3L8nJ43gnSCuKv08V0wQ  3) Sausage and Eggs were pretty standard thick links with eggs and seasoned potatoes. It was good, but nothing special. You could probably buy the same links at a market and make it yourself. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-cracked-egg-las-vegas-2?select=6Nzg1wAdBviOQNXVmfXlkg#fbjiuYm9Je2vHxb9QXLOaw  Service: The servers were very nice and checked on us regularly to see how we were doing. You actually have to go up to the front to pay, which I found to be pretty inconvenient."}
{"text":"Came here with the Misses. Was packed but wait was only 5 mins. Has the corned beef hash and the coffee cake. Food was super legit. Server was hella friendly and the atmosphere is easy going. Will most definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great food but really loud and crowded. This wouldn't be so bad if the support staff didn't seem overworked and overwhelmed."}
{"text":"I normally don't have high standards when it comes to breakfast places because I've had quite a few mishaps with them. For starters, they're always busy with long waits for so-so flavors. If I had to go through that again, I'd skip to the next breakfast joint.   Now the interesting part about The Cracked Egg is their presentation. It's traditional, welcoming and friendly to say the least. Many of the entrees there seems like something you can get at other competition yet I feel like they can execute it better. First, I had the pleasure to try their Joe's Scramble. This consisted of Three Eggs scrambled with Seasoned Ground Beef, Spinach, Cream Cheese, Scallions and Jack & Cheddar Cheese. The moment I read ground beef, I was sold. Unlike other breakfast places, they make their eggs so it's not overcooked. That's my favorite part because I start to get pretty upset when scrambled eggs are poorly made.   You also have a choice to toast and coffee cake. Choose the coffee cake. You'll thank me later. The cake tasted almost like angel cake offering soft and fluffy bites to them. Delicious to say the least and this was probably the highlight of my stay. But it doesn't stop there; it's served warm with bits of peach because they know good food. Is it possible to have two servings of that??   The service was great as our server continued to ask how we were doing. The food was long either because after a few minutes of ordering, I was already downing the most amazing coffee cake I've had the pleasure in eating :P   Also, there's no wifi there which made me appreciate the ambiance a lot more! Written on a placard states, \"no wifi, pretend it's like the 1940s and socialize.\" Okay, I'm pretty sure that's not what it said. It you get the idea. Nonetheless, it was bittersweet.   Now the question is, would I come back? Heck yeah! No wait and good food? Who can beat that?"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday after our work out at lifetime fitness. It reminded me of egg works, but a bit more pricey. The ambienc was nice and we were sat right away which was good. The food was okay. I tried the eggs Benedict because that's my usual go to for breakfast. It was okay. I had to add a bit of pesto sauce for some flavor. The coffee cake was good when it was hot."}
