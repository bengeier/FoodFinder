{"text":"The Kobe Short Ribs I ordered, an excellent idea, fell short on execution.  They overcooked the meat somewhat, but the vegetables, crispy noodles, and soy based sauce all melded well together. The place looked very nice, and the host, maybe manager did check to see how everything was.  I didn't have time to go into detail and wait for any replacement, cause I had to get to a show, so I said it was good, and for the record, it was almost, very good."}
{"text":"Has always been my favorite place to go every time we go to vegas.  The green bean dish, jumbo garlic prawns, and especially the roast duck is my biggest favorite.  The roast duck was always moist and glazing.  However, this trip, it was a disappointment, roast duck was dry and super salty and the green beans too chewy - hence the 3 stars. However, I will still come back to this place when I visit again."}
{"text":"This review is based on the only 2 items I've tried from this restaurant.

My husband and I got a take out order of Char Siu Bao (bbq pork bun) and vegetable fried rice. The Char Siu Bao was very very good! I haven't got such a good one in a very long time! The bun was soft and warm. The char siu (bbq pork) and the sauce inside was good. It was as good as what I used to have when I was a child in HK. 

The fried rice was good too. It didn't come out greasy at the bottom, and the rice was in good texture. It was jasmine rice too. The rice wasn't too hard or too soft. It's way better than what I get in Honolulu. I normally don't eat much fried rice (because most places don't make a good one), but this fried rice was just so good that I can break my rule and eat more fried rice. 

I know the price is expensive at this place if you compare to the price in China Town. But good Chinese food does worth more money. Not all Chinese food has to be cheap and not all cheap Chinese food can give you satisfaction. I don't mind to pay the price at Grand Wok to have such a good Char Siu Bao and fried rice. I am not eating there every day anyway. I only do it once in a while and it's worth to pay more to have a higher quality of taste."}
{"text":"In our opinion, this is the overall best choice at MGM. Surprisingly great food, reasonable prices, nice service."}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner with my fiance and mother after Ka. Place wasn't empty but wasn't busy either for 11:30PMish. Waitress took our drink orders,  all waters. I kindly asked for a wedge if lemon,  not brought. Asked again... I guess she thought it was funny to bring a whole lemon diced. I ordered Mongolian beef w/ a side of jasmine rice and they ordered sushi rolls spicy California, spider roll, and a Nevada roll. Food took about 10mins, all came out one after another. My Mongolian beef was mediocre at best, I've had better at panda express. Their sushi looked appealing, same though,  nothing extraordinary other than the price. I get this restaurant is in a hotel, so if you're looking for fabulous flavor/food for your money... You're probably better off venturing off the strip if you're able."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Started off with apps quickly and then the food didn't arrive for over an hour with no apologies and the hot dishes were cold. We watched them sit under the hot lamps for 20 minutes and asked what the status was Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"After trying this place for a second time during lunch, I found the food to be considerably better. I didn't order the sushi rolls and instead ordered Kung Pao Chicken and was pleasantly pleased."}
{"text":"Awesome Aloha Roll and Kung Pao Chicken. Great Sake list too."}
{"text":"Great place for reasonably authentic chinese food in Vegas. Try the hainanese chicken."}
{"text":"Comfort food. I love it! Wonton soup is very tasty. Mongolian beef highly recommended the beef is very tender."}
{"text":"Pros:
Vegetarian friendly
Good selection of sake
Great ambience
Quality non greasy food
Prompt service
Fair pricing

Neutral:
If you are seated at the sushi bar, it can get noisy
Could have waiting time"}
{"text":"Terrible food and service. Every dish was disgusting and the staff ignored us continuously."}
{"text":"Honestly, guys, you are lucky because of your touristic location. Have you opened your place in the Bay Area where there are lots of good competitive sushi places, you would be out of business in 3-4 weeks. 
Food: Very mediocre at best. Please don't tell me what is this red paste that you put inside your roll. In any case it ain't fish.
Service: Well, I ordered hot green tea, pot stickers for appetizer, and a roll. Waited for quite a while, the roll came first. I had to remind about the pot stickers. Seriously, serving an appetizer way after the main dish? What about the tea? The tea never came at all.
Price: The same roll in the best places in the Bay Area costs half the price and has much better quality. Same can be said about the pot stickers.
I leave conclusions to you. Just shared my experience."}
{"text":"Another anniversary June '08...we planned on going back to Shibuya for dinner. After the whole day of shopping and walking...we decided to just eat at a somewhat decent place in MGM grand then off to snoozing!
There we found The Grand Wok & Sushi Bar.

What we like about it is a somewhat \"fine dining\" feel yet has a casual vibe. 

We ordered sushi...of course. Great sushi! Fresh-which is good! :) I love that they just dont offer Japanese food. They offer Chinese, Korean, Indonesian...etc fare.

I also recommend the Honey Glazed BBQ Pork-Yum! 

1 thing that really bothered me and the bf (days after we dined here)...Sake. So we ordered sparkling sake (Hou Hou Shu) really refreshing and ultimately became my fave. For about 300ML, it was $30 a bottle. We just decided to splurge since it was our anniversary and all. A few weeks after, we went to True Sake in SF, CA...found the same bottle, same size for $14. dannnnnnnm. 

Well, it was Vegas after all. LOL."}
{"text":"Love this place. We come here every time we're in Vegas. The food is always good. The service is excellent. You can't go wrong with anything you order."}
{"text":"Overpriced. It's in MGM, so of course it should be fancy and more expensive than everything else. But they try so hard to \"look\" fancy and upscale without having value to it.

Go there if you don't mind paying double for just fancy American-Asian food. Don't go there if you're looking for authentic Asian food."}
{"text":"Our waiter was taking our order and told us the portion sizes were for 1-2 people tops, so we ordered 2 plate of each dish, and ended up taking food home. Then our waiter took our check back to scan the credit card, he didn't come back for about 20 minutes, and we had to ask for it back. Food is pretty good, customer service isn't ideal."}
{"text":"One word of advice, avoid the chow mein. The beef not only tasted disgusting (very low quality), the noodles were overcooked and the entire dish had maybe 5 vegetables total. It was so unpalatable I ended up sending it back. The sushi here however, is pretty decent."}
{"text":"Worst food poisoning of my life by far. I did not have any alcohol in my system so that is not an excuse. I am vegetarian and ordered the Vegetable Fried Rice and asked the served when ordering whether or not the dish was fully vegetarian and she said yes. My boyfriend had a little of my vegetable fried rice and he is not vegetarian at all. 30 minutes after the meal he threw up. 20 minutes after him, I threw up 13 times within 2 hours IN PUBLIC!! Most horrific experience. I still can't eat anything but saltines."}
{"text":"Shared the alaska roll, someother roll which i can't remember but also start with an \"a\".  Tasted really fresh and the seaweed in the roll was tasty. It was crowded."}
{"text":"It was fine. The cucumbers were soooo good! Should have had those and some tea then jammed out of there. $9 fir a CUP of hot and sour soup? That's robbery!!"}
{"text":"My boy-friend and I were craving sushi but the Vegas Strip prices almost made us loose our appetite. So we turned to yelp for help. Sushi buffets seemed more reasonably priced, but they were a part of larger buffets, which had all sorts of food in one. This made me unsure about the quality (I am not the shampoo + conditioner = two-in-one kind of person). 

We came across Grand Wok reviews. The menu offered the desired sushi and the prices were not frighting. We decided to walk to MGM and check it out. We were ready to go elsewhere if the place looked like an Americanized Chinese fast food joint. To our surprise the place looked very cute, cozy and refreshing with the bamboo columns and riverside stones wall. 

The sushi turned out to be delicious with a 5 star presentation. We ordered three rolls to share for the appetizer and I was full before our entrées were presented. Once I tried my coconut curry chicken, I couldn't stop and almost finished the dish. Poor me:)

Most importantly, the service was outstanding. Our server was very intuitive and when my all-American boy-friend ordered some interesting sounding dish, she took time to explain what it was and to make sure that it was exactly what he wanted. Turned out that my sea-food lover ordered an oatmeal soup. She recommended another dish, which he ended up ordering. If not for the attentive waitress, he would have not enjoyed his meal whatsoever. I wish I could remember the name of that nice Asian lady. She was an incredible, positive, fast and smiley server. 
 
Three sushi rolls and two entries came up to about  $80.  Next time we are in Grand Wok I will skip the entrée and just have sushi. I was feeling a little too full for a late dinner and got sleepy, which you can't do when you are in Vegas:)"}
{"text":"I came to Vegas and stayed at the Tropicana as it was close to where I needed to go for a work convention.  During my time off though, I hung out a lot at the MGM Grand gambling, drinking and just having plain old fun.  Well I passed by this place several times and I was curious about the place.  One night, we were craving Asian and there was a Japanese restaurant in the Tropicana, but there was NO one in there.  We ran away as fast as we could.  NOT a good sign when a place looks empty.  Because I saw this place so much, I opted to go here.

We were promptly seated at the bar and I got a rainbow roll that was delicious.  It was nice to sit at the bar and watch everything get made.  Seriously, there was a waitress named Min who took care of the big tables.  For such a tiny woman, she was carrying HUGE trays of food.  We renamed her Max for all her strength and efficiency! Color me impressed! Service was great, everyone was really nice and also have the Lobster and Papaya salad! It's a tiny bit bland, but still nice and refreshing to have with the roll!

It's a great casual place that's not too expensive.  And my lucky machines were right outside this place so I can't complain.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is generally good service and flavorful food.  At times, the service can be a little slow or mechanical.

The last meal that I had was flavorful and delicious.  We started off with the shrimp dumplings with bamboo shoots.  The dumplings were very pretty to look at.  There were four dumplings to the order and the plate was oversized, making them seem smaller.  They were served hot and were tasty.  The waitress commented that she liked the hot sauce so she brought it out and put it near my non gringo friend.  I moved it over to my side, and true to form, it was delicious.  My friend burnt his tongue on the spiciness of it when he tried a little.

We also had the shrimp fried rice and the beef with broccoli.  The fried rice was average, and the shrimp were plump and moist.  A little more ginger would have gone a long way.  The garlic shaved over the top was delicious. And appreciated.

The beef was tender.  Melt in your mouth tender.  I don't know how they make meat that tender, but a friend of mine said it was corn starch.  If it is, you may want to invest in corn starch futures when I start cooking.  The sauce was comforting.  It imparting a delicious flavor to it.  Not too salty.  The broccoli was Chinese broccoli.  It was leafier than what I have typically had, but it was flavorful, and I am sure it was better than regular American broccoli.

Did I mention that I ordered dessert?  We had the sorbet trio.  A scoop of coconut sorbet, a scoop of raspberrysorbet, and a scoop of mango sorbet.  Or at least on the night I went.  The coconut tasted like coconut, the mango tasted like mango (and had a piece or two of dried mango and some pineapple on top), and the snozzberry definitely did not taste like snozzberry.  Actually, the raspberry sorbet had a very flowery flavor.  It tasted like perfume.  Or Bigelow tea.  So, I asked our server, \"Hey.  What makes this taste like perfume?  Or Bigelow tea?\"  She responded that the chef used rose water when making the raspberry sorbet.  It immediately became more palatable to me.  

Pricy, but you are on the Strip."}
{"text":"Just OK.

I've been coming here for a few years now because it's so convenient.  Staying at the MGM Grand it is way too easy to just hop in here for a quick bite -- especially when you don't want to be pulled away from the craps or pai gow tables for too long.

It's really not bad here, but nothing really to write home about.  It's a combination Chinese and Japanese restaurant which means they serve everything from combination fried rice and wonton soup to premium sushi cut rolls and sake.

The food here is just average though.  Everything across the board is average.  The fried rice is average.  The rolls are average.  The Hainan chicken is average.  The service is average.  They don't staff very well here and don't be surprised if it takes 10-15 minutes just for them to come take your order.  Not to mention trying to get your food.  Don't come here if you're looking to get a quick bite -- happen not gonna."}
{"text":"Terrible. The only good thing about this place was the wait staff.  We got our food, pretty much left it on the plate, paid and left.  We asked the waitress to pass on the message about the terrible pad Thai and Kung Pao.  We couldn't recreate food this bad.  Flavourless unless you count salt as a flavour."}
{"text":"I had a great meal here for my niece's birthday.  Loved the orange chicken, garlicky pot stickers, and lettuce wraps.  I've had much better beef low main though.  This place is a little pricey, but then again it is an upscale \"strip\" restaurant with nice decor and a cool open kitchen.  Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I have stayed at the MGM several times and this was the first time I checked this place out.  The sushi was delicious and the service was just as good.

Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food is just ok. Pretty bland overall. Good service. Insanely overpriced given quality of food even for Vegas."}
{"text":"Last day of my trip in Vegas and this place was a nice place to end it. 
Ordered the salt and pepper tofu because of another person on Yelp who ordered it and said it was delicious. I only had the photo of it and the waitress knew exactly what it was. Thumbs up.
It was spicy, but it was the good kind of spicy. From what I remember it was approximately ~$17. Not bad considering the portion was huge. 

Would come here again!"}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service was horrible because of this older Asian server she was horrible gave us the wrong order and came to our table screaming at us that we were wrong that she got the orders right?!? Then throughout the whole time she kept looking at us wrong. She made us feel uncomfortable"}
{"text":"WORST resturant i went on my whole trip!!!!!!!!! Poor customer service, after having an appetizer my roll never came and I had to tell my waitress who told me I should have reminded her my roll never came...the roll it looked all dried out and dull, and it had this really awful smell. Kind of like when you use way too much detergent in washing your tupperware, put your food in the tupperware, and then your food ends up smelling like a mix of plastic tupperware and detergent. The waitress was a hostile listener. She never came to check on us. Every time we asked her for something she totally looked frustrated.

This place is a pass. I will never, never return."}
{"text":"Near the mgm casino floor.  It was a good sign when all their staff was chinese.  I knew i was going to get some good food.  Had the wonton noodle soup and I think it's the best you can get on the strip.  Everyone else in my party also enjoyed their food.  Noodle soup is the best hangover food!!"}
{"text":"The Grand Wok serves average food at best with premium prices. Las Vegas is generally expensive but the food here is comparable to that of your local Chinese food takeout. I would even argue that the Orange Chicken tasted worse than most local Chinese food takeout restaurants. The price point was a whopping $21.  The rolls were okay but the cost was 2.5 times that of your typical Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"5-star service. We got there at 6:20 and told them we were starving and only had a limited time since we were seeing Cirque du Soleil's KA at 7pm. From the hostess to our lovely waitress to the kitchen putting in a rush order, the staff could not be any more amazing.  We throughly enjoyed the beef wok and spicy tuna roll.  Thanks, Grand Wok!"}
{"text":"Located in MGM Grand, fairly easy to get a table. No reservations, walk in only. Staff friendliness was hit or miss. Waitress was annoyed we wanted separate checks.  I dont know. Go figure.  Good basic sushi, really fresh, but not many option, just the basics.  However, extremely over price...everything was basically double what I would pay in Dallas...but it's a Vegas tourist trap! Lol!  What do you expect. If you need a sushi fix, quickly,  without a completely high $ menu...go check it out."}
{"text":"Lettuce wrap, steamed chicken, house fried noodle on point!!  We order all the sushi and it was all good!  Maybe cause MGM comped the meal it taste Bomb!

Will come back comp or no comped.."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Ate there twice, on my last visit to Vegas, Sept. 2017. 
The guacamole is made fresh, at your table. You choose the ingredients. The best guac I've ever had. Other dishes were great, as well. Just good food!"}
{"text":"Fiancé found a hair in his food - we told 2 different employees and were told they would \"check into it\". The meal ended up being removed from the bill"}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible, terrible.

Hey, I know its Vegas so I expect things to be on the steep side.  But feeling like you have been completely ripped off is another thing.  The Famed Red Dragon roll?  A smallish $17.50 cut roll with stale, cold and rubbery shrimp tempura in it (I didn't even know shrimp tempura could BE rubbery).  A hand roll is $11.50.   A 10oz sake is $18.00 and they were short pouring.  No wonder the waitress was pouring our drinks for us!  4 small cups per bottle- seriously about half of what the bottle holds.

Our waitress, while friendly, misunderstood our order several times.  She also was quite condescending, pointing out the standard tourist fare when we are really into experimenting with new foods.

The staff here is jaded, and clearly know their food and service sucks.  They act like they are used to complaints on a regular basis and just don't give a sh*t because they know you are never coming back, but they also know it's Vegas and there are fresh suckers every day.  Why should they care?

I'm actually being really nice here, because I am trying to be fair, but my wife and I were quite upset after leaving here, feeling like we were treated like crap and robbed.  Who wants to eat someplace like that?  The other reviewers mention that you can go to Panda Express and get better food- I would say that Panda Express ROCKS in comparison.

If they had run to Panda Express and thrown that on my plate and charged me $18 for it I would at least say it tasted decent.  It probably would have been faster too."}
{"text":"Actually really good Asian food considering that a place like Jasmine in the Bellagio seems to have dumbed down its food to appeal to the widest variety of people.

Our server was knowledgeable and attentive.  Food came fast. The server recommended the Chinese beef noodle soup which was spicy and terrific.  My friend is vegan and the server had cooked a unique stir fry of vegetables and eggplants that my friend said was very tasty.

Feels like a REAL Chinese restaurant like you'd get in NYC or San Francisco, in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food.  Eel was excellent as was the aloha roll."}
{"text":"WORST RESTURANT I WENT ON MY WHOLE TRIP! I wanted so badly to have a serious chat with the manager at the end of my meal but didn't see the point like it would change anything.. so here's the scoop on this waaaay overpriced dollar strip mall Chinese food spot. I had the black pepper beef, my girl had the pad thai, we both had a diet coke... total bill including tip.. $80. The black pepper beef tasted good, but there were huge (steak fry size) chunks of chewy beef and ton of pea pods. The beef was tough and chewy too bite through, and no knife was provided to cut it... so im sitting there chewing like cow to eat this huge hunk of meat that I can't bite through. Portion size wouldn't fill a panda express two item combo Styrofoam box but the price was large enough to buy 4 of them. Her pad thai was soggy and flavorless. I live minutes from north Hollywood where there's a Thai restaurant ever half mile. The waiter did do a good job and kept the drinks full and was nice, not his fault the food was crap. Oh, and in this fancy upscale overpriced restaurant the lady sitting next to us was straight blowing her nose like she had the flu every 15 minutes.. Disgusting, and not very classy.
IN MY OPINION: A complete waste of money! Do not go here! Spend half as much for twice as much food at pf changs or something.. grand wok is hella wacked!"}
{"text":"Beef noodle soup comes with a lot of meat. A little pricy but definitely worth it. Be sure to try out the hot sauce too.."}
{"text":"A solid average Asian food place.   We got some beef fried rice and Tom Yum soup and it was all pretty standard fare.   Would never go out of our way to eat here but if happened to be right there at the MGM and craved Chinese food, might give it another try."}
{"text":"I thought that it was pretty good, but it was really expensive for the portions sizes that you got.

I got some of the generic sushi varieties because I didn't want to chance it before seeing a show, and I would have to say that I could have gotten the same (if not better) at a hole in the wall joint off the strip.  It was average and the only difference was the plate it was served on.

I do not think that I will be going again unless it is for entertainment purposes on the strip."}
{"text":"I guess i shouldn't be surprised.  In Vegas, you always pay tooo much for mediocre food.  My friends and I were craving something asian, and this place was right in our hotel. I read a couple bad and good reviews, but we decided to give this place a shot since we didn't want to walk too far.

First, this place is asian fusion, so you get Chinese, Japanese, Thai, and a couple others.  I was craving noodles, so I ordered the flat rice noodles with beef.  Definitely hit the spot, but then again, i was drinking all day so top ramen would have it the spot as well.  My friend ordered sushi, and it looked bland bland bland.  My other friend ordered the potstickers.  WOW they gave her four and charged $14!  Even my beef noodles cost $18.  

Probably wouldn't come back here unless someone else paid."}
{"text":"The environment is pretty cool since you are sitting inside the MGM casino. I had the fried sea bass. A little extra on the fish side. Oh and watch out for them bones. They come out. We also had the salt and pepper calimari. Smaller pieces but very good. For an Asian restaurant in a casino, can't expect too much I guess."}
{"text":"Rock Shrimp Pad Thai was soo good! I'm always worried I\"ll get gypped on shrimp but they were good size and plenty enough for the large plate of noodles! Service was good and I think prices were reasonable for Vegas. $20 for a large shrimp pad thai, when it's normally a minimum of $16 and not the same quality shrimp. Went on a Friday night around 8:30 not too bad of a wait, and were able to get a party of 12 out within a little over an hour. I will definitely go back when I hit Vegas in the summer."}
{"text":"I can't speak for their cooked menu but the sushi is a disgrace here. I tried the most expensive roll - Las Vegas Roll for $18. It had no Nigiri and was full of imitation crab meat and what tasted like canned tuna.  My only mistake was finishing the roll instead of sending it back and walking away.  Manager offered no refund after I complained.  

I'm literally astonished that they present this as upscale Sushi."}
{"text":"Cant stand this place. Service is terrible. If my wife wasn't somehow convinced that tempura flakes in sushi and edamame in veggie fried rice was some brilliant concoction i would never set foot in here again. I am here now and had to sit for 15 minutes before the server greeted us. She is very rude and screws up our order every time. Stay away from here unless you like poor service and overpriced asian food."}
{"text":"The tuna was of a low quality towards the tail and not very fresh.  The chicken in the kung pao was very poor and under cooked, but the vegetables were good.  The sauce was very thick and cloying.  They refused to add more spice to my kung pao and instead brought me some of that nasty sweet hot mix to put into it.  The drink that I ordered was quite good, but I'm pretty sure it was fixed by the MGM back bar.  Too expensive for such poor quality, better off going to a panda express."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at the Grand Wok and it was a very good. I had the maguro tuna, uni and ama ebi sushi and they were all fresh and delicious. I also had the beef lo main. The snap peas were fresh and cooked perfect. 
 I am on a business trip wishing my wife was with me so she could try the uni. Next time honey!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with our  meal of wonton noodle &  pan fried beef noodle dish @ the Grand Wok & Sushi Bar, during our 6/12/16 visit.  We arrived around 9:30pm, so seating was easy to get. Service was prompt."}
{"text":"We were in starving and didn't want a buffet, so landed at this restaurant. The atmosphere was inviting and had a younger vibe.  Our server was very friendly, BUT......the food was not good and was way over-priced!!!! 

We ordered the chicken lettuce cups ($13) to start. They are essentially lettuce wraps that you make yourself. The lettuce was crisp, but the filling had absolutely zero flavor. They are topped with pine nuts which gave them some crunch. 

We also ordered the wok-seared pork with udon noodles in XO sauce ($21). The noodles were cooked al dente, but again, not very tasty. We were not impressed with this dish at all. Just noodles and meat in a bland sauce.

And the worst dish that we ordered was the garlic shrimp fried rice ($23). NO flavor at all. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, not chewy, but the rice was very plain! There was nothing else in the rice but some dried, shaved scallop on top. I couldn't even taste the garlic! 

We regretted going to dinner here because not only was it so expensive, but the food had no flavor. I've had much better food at hole-in-the-wall, tiny, authentic Asian restaurants that serve $8 entrees in a Styrofoam take-out container!"}
{"text":"If you're in the casino looking for a dinner joint, this one's a good stop.

Went here with family during a vacation. Food was great (try the shrimp!), decor was solid, service was quick.

Prices were about what you'd expect for a casino restaurant in Vegas.

One complaint: the staff seemed a little posses off at us for not being huge spenders. We still enjoyed our meal, but a little less sneering would have been nice."}
{"text":"We were walking through the casino and we got hungry and stopped here to eat. 

Waiting time was minimal, it was at night, can't remember the time. Hostess and waitress were very nice and accommodating. 
We got the menu and we ordered right away.
We had the calamari fried as an appetizer and uni. The calamari had a great taste with a kick of spiciness and the sea urchin was awesome, it was very clean and it came in a type of roll.
We also ordered some rolls, but the presentation was normal and they could've been a bit bigger. It's not that I expect super decorated rolls every time but for the price that I was paying I was expecting a little more. 
Dessert was good, we tried the assorted mochi and they had great flavor."}
{"text":"The salmon sashimi was fresh and pretty tasty. Chinese food is overpriced, but decent."}
{"text":"Great service. The food menu is kind of confusing. Not sure if this is a Japanese, Chinese, or Thai restaurant. It's probably just \"Asian\" for the tourists. 

The food really is mediocre especially for the price. There's nothing really special other than the \"xo\" sauce, which I couldn't really differentiate than spicy soy sauce. 

All in all, not necessary to eat here."}
{"text":"Service is the only compliment I can attribute to this place.  The food is at best marginal.  If yoj want real chinese food, its not here.  There bbq meats are not tasty unless you just like soy sauce spill on meats."}
{"text":"I'll never eat here again.  The sushi was cold, the rolls didn't taste good and the service sucked.  I ordered 4 different rolls, ate only one of each, told the server I didn't like any of them, and she just laughed - but would not take them off the bill despite me not eating anything further.  Also extremely over-priced.  There are plenty of great places to eat sushi in Vegas - this is NOT one of them."}
{"text":"The sushi is super fresh. Sashimi salad is filled, I mean filled with hamachi salmon and tuna and don't miss this.
The rest of the menu is pan Asian but the best flavors are the noodle dishes from a half a dozen countries.
 
I had steamed seabass with fermented black bean sauce and shredded potatoes southeast China style. Yummy! Prices are reasonable for Vegas."}
{"text":"This was our original dinner destination but the hostess on Thursday night on 12/28/2017 didn't even acknowledge us. After waiting about a minute for her to at least make eye contact, she walked away and so did we."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in the MGM as its cheap, tasty and always fast. The nasi goreng is amazing as it comes complete with chicken satay skewers and a cooling cucumber dip which you need as the rice is very spicy.
The BBQ combination is also brill and the sushi is so fresh and tasty. Been here about six times and have never had bad service or a bad meal, maybe I'm easy to please but trust me go and give it ago..x"}
{"text":"Fish that's obviously, by taste and fishy odor, around 2 or 3 days past it's prime. Tasteless \"Vietnamese\" spring rolls. Be careful to avoid the uncomfortable aftermath of eating aging seafood!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere however the food was not worth the wait or the price. Very basic for Vegas sushi could've picked up a pre made roll from Ralph's instead."}
{"text":"Micely decorated but mediocre food..
The restaurant has a decent amount of tables but at night it could get crowded! It's nicely decorated inside, but you don't have to dress up, casual clothes would be fine too! The service is good, the waitress I had was very kind:) 
* definitely more on the pricey side though..

- Philadelphia roll: good amount of salmon and avocado, but too little cream cheese. The amount of cream cheese in each piece didn't even make a difference to the taste of the roll.
- Nevada roll: shrimp, avocado, and cucumber. Skimpy on the filling, not much shrimp on the inside and it seemed like it was more rice.
- Spider roll: probably the best roll of the 3 we ordered but it was okay, not great.
- Fish, chicken, egg fried rice: the dominant flavor was egg, this dish was okay-tasting as well. I feel like I could make it at home; I liked this rice a little more than the sushi.

*overall, food was alright but not worth the price. I'd recommend looking for another place because you might as well eat good food for the money you're paying"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice since being in town.  I loved the summer rolls and the Philadelphia rolls.  My husband had the spicy California rolls but didn't like them.  I would eat here again.  I liked the waiters and the atmosphere.  The place seemed clean and well maintained.  I would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"NASTY!!!  That's all I am going to say.  I should have listened and never go to a place that as \"wok\" in their name.

Worst food I have ever had."}
{"text":"Stopped here because the 2 females of the group wanted Asian food, and that pretty much means my opinion (1 male) does not matter.  MGM Grand, Asian food...what can go wrong?  Well...nothing really went wrong, but then again nothing really went right.  The prices were a little steep for what you are getting.  I think this is more indicative of being located in MGM Grand.  The selection was the usual Asian cuisine. I even saw some older Asian guy eating a boatload of noodles in this small glass concealed room in the middle of the restaurant as though he were some type of exhibit.  Maybe MGM Grand got rid of the Lion Exhibit and replaced it with this dude....the \"Asian eating a boatload of noodles exhibit.\"  

Anyway....the food was ok, the prices were high.  However, that is not the reason to not come here totally.  The reason you shouldn't come here is because the freaking bathroom does not exist!  You have to walk past the craps tables (ironic enough) to find the bathroom.  So...let me understand this.  I have a mouth full of noodles and I must travel many moons in order to relieve my noodle?  Nah...

Find another place."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special but got a bite to eat here, last minute before heading to a show. The service was fine, atmosphere was ok and the food was good.  I think my bill was around $20. Not bad for Vegas."}
{"text":"Caterpillar roll BBQ eel and Hass avocado, honey walnut shrimp and combination fried rice, Vietnamese shrimp pho.  Pricey for so so food.  Suggest going to Sushi Fever or Sushi Tower and Steakhouse."}
{"text":"To varying degrees, every restaurant I have tried at MGM Grand has been a bust. 

At Craftsteak, dinner was - at best - fine. But mostly pricey and underwhelming. 

At Studio Cafe, breakfast was like an expensive version of Denny's. 

More recently, my friends and I tried The Grand Wok for dinner. 

The verdict? Probably the worst sushi I have ever eaten at this price point. 

Note that Studio Cafe and Grand Wok share a demising wall. As a result, this configuration probably constitutes the two worst restaurants back-to-back anywhere in the United States. At least in my experience.

I'm not sure why I keep doing this to myself. I have never even stayed at MGM Grand."}
{"text":"This is the best option for dining at the MGM in Las Vegas. The service is courteous and quick and they do a good job of keeping the busy place rolling along fairly smoothly. They give you a pager to call you when your table is ready so you can go out and earn your dinner money before you head to your table. The sushi here is better priced than the neighboring Shibuya and of somewhat lesser quality, but I still like it. Other items ordered off the menu were all worthwhile and probably a better bet than the sushi, depending on what you are in the mood for. My friend who has lived in Japan for two years was satisfied with the sushi, so that means good things I suppose. As I recall the sake and hamachi were particularly good. 

Warning - I was once eating some odd soup here when I saw a green bean that looked tasty. Upon taking a huge bite I realized that was no bean, it was a fking pepper and it kicked my ass. My eyes turned red and I felt like I needed to empty the contents of my stomach on the sushi bar. Rough! I guess I just wasn't paying attention but I got owned here. And I still come back. That's good."}
{"text":"for 1 person,
ordered Sea Dragon, two pieces of yellowtail and a cup of 4oz sake. later on, added Las Vegas rolls.
very good meal!"}
{"text":"The prices are cheaper than anything else in the MGM Grand, but everything else is super expensive. I think this could have also passed if it were near some touristy area in nyc, but at least the food wasn't terrible. I did come here multiple times to get a quick bite of noodle soupy stuff before some shows and they were extremely nice. If you're in the MGM Grand and you don't have a car, I think this place is a safe bet."}
{"text":"Definitely been one of my favs for years. This time tried the BBQ Pork appetizer. OMG!!! Are you kidding me!! Melt in your mouth. and it's affordable. Thx Vegas for making my tumultuous week."}
{"text":"If I could use the work \"YUCK\" to tell how back the food is here I would but simply don't it would do justice. 

Unfortunately we were in between lunch and dinner hours and most places I wanted to go to were closed. This was open but not too full. 

The service was somewhat slow and everyone seemed to be waiting while the staff cleaned. 

We ordered a handful of rolls and seafood fried rice. 

The sushi rice was pretty old. It was gummy and just didn't taste right. 
I felt very Gordon Ramsay ish after the first bite. I started ripping apart the dragon roll looking for something good. The fish was ok. Nothing special but nothing terrible. However I'd like to harp on the rice again. It was bad. I think had I ordered sashimi I'd have been fine. 

The fried rice wasn't too different from what you would get a \"Panda...insert name\" in a mall. It was greasy with very little seafood and what appeared to be frozen vegetables. 

I really should have just had drinks and waited for a place to open up. Oh well, I can say I was here."}
{"text":"hm....well first off it looked really nice from the outside and there were not that many big tables. So if you are planning to eat with about 8 people, you are going to be waiting for one of two tables. There were many small tables for two people so the wait would probably be short. My group waited around and hour and 20 mins to get a table because the bastards that were hogging the tables were getting multiple rounds of drinks and talked until their damn lips fell off. So since there were slot machines near by, i was burning more money in my wallet while i waited. 

When we finally got in there, we were pretty disappointed because the person said 30 mins, but you can't blame the hostess, blame the stupid people at the table. But in return for our long wait the service was pretty good. The manager seated us personally and got us our drinks and stuff. From working in a restaurant i could tell she was totally kissing ass, but she was doing a good at it. 

I got myself a nice Captain and coke and my friend got a red orchid drink that was fruity. All of us (8) order one plate and we all shared. We thought that the plates would be a good size....but there were small! I ordered the Mongolian Beef and it was like $17. For $17 you should get a good amount of beef, but i got like 12 pieces. hm... Well i guess it's in the MGM grand so they think they are all top of the line cuisine. EH. Some of the dishes that were chosen were good, some were okay. This Asian fusion thing was not the best i have had, but food is food and i was hungry at the time. 

Then my friend's mother told the manager that we were celebrating me, and my two friend's birthday so we got dessert on the house. Woohoo! Everyone else got a fortune cookie. I got some chocolate moose thing in a martini glass that was good. One of my friends got a plate of strawberry cheesecake, and the other got 3 little mounts of regular cheesecake. Mine was the best so i shared with everyone and it was the first one finished. After a couple of drinks we had a show to go to so we paid the ridiculous bill amount and left semi-satisfied. Next time i'm hitting the buffet."}
{"text":"Three stars because this place is overpriced, otherwise it's all good. Any \"gourmet\" chinese food usually indicates a red flag in my head because chinese food wasn't meant to be gourmet. However, this place was full of Asian people and that's always a good sign.

I ordered the appetizer trio, pan fried seabass and beef tenderloin with asparagus (see photos). I enjoyed everything and walked away satisfied. Dining here was a good alternative to our usual round of buffets and finer dining establishments (especially when you're craving chinese food)."}
{"text":"We had 25 min to eat before seeing a show.  Torn between an over priced sandwich at Starbucks or sushi... we chose sushi.


We told the host our time restrictions and she immediately jumped... asked if knew knew our favorite rolls and sat us down.

Our server brought water and put in our order   said she would put a rush on it.   

Rolls were served and our bill was brought without asking   we paid and left. 

Service was top notch.   And the food tasted good."}
{"text":"Yes, I do agree with some of the reviews that say, your on the strip, it is Las. Vegas, but, I don't mind paying for what we get, but I want to get what I pay for!
Spring rolls, I have never gotten such a small pencil size roll, it was only a mouth full, there were six of them, how much does it cost for rice noodles? At least give a decent size Spring Roll for an appetizer.
We had a rainbow roll,  very small and no sauce on top.
House wine, $16.00, give me a break!
Not worth the money for what you get, way over rated!!, servings are small!"}
{"text":"Food and service were okay. Among the dishes I ate were sweet & sour soup and tofu with baby bok choy.

The decor seemed fancy. I liked the jellyfish lights near the entrance and the wood-covered menus."}
{"text":"Why did we even come here?? I must defend myself. It was at the MGM where we were staying and we were too lazy to leave the hotel. I must say...take your $$$ elsewhere. The service was slow and the food lacked flavor. I think my curry dish was nearly $30 and tasted like it came from a frozen bag from the grocery store. I'm not being harsh...I'm being honest! I also ordered a few sushi rolls and they were a joke. The raw fish looked sketchy and wouldn't even hold together on the plate. Ohh...and to top it off, my sister's noodle dish had a strand of hair in it. All in all... \"EEEk! Methinks not\" is an understatement."}
{"text":"I'd avoid the place unless you're strictly looking for sushi.  They have a nice staff and an authentic wok grill, but they come short o delivering flavor.  The sushi is great, which can only afford them a few breaks since they prepare it, but nature made the flavor.  The Lo Mein is dismal.  Greasy, fatty, broken noodles, generally in appealing.  I made it through 3 sticks full and gave up -  even after adding bowl of sriracha.  MGM needs to re-evaluate of they want this place tied to their name or just trim it to what they're good at -- sushi; lose the wok.

I actually tried this place twice, both at corporate events where a few of set aside some time to have some private dinner.  BOTH experiences were practically identical.  Good sushi, very poor entrees.  Teh Lettuce wraps were pretty good; but i wouldn't Recommend going much above the Sushi and Apps."}
{"text":"People here have bitched about the price, but c'mon folks:  a sushi restaurant on the Strip?  Expect to pay higher prices.

After day two of a financial software conference, I wanted comfort food:  sushi and/or rice noodles.  And comfort food is what I got:  Aloha Roll, Rainbow Roll, and Singapore Curry with Shrimp, BBQ Pork, and Rice Noodles. 

The rolls were served fast -- and flawlessly.  The Singapore Noodles weren't the best I've had, but they served the purpose.

On a final note, this restaurant is located inside the casino, not on or near the promenade where most of the other restaurants and bars at the MGM Grand are located.  As such, it might be difficult to find at first."}
{"text":"I would have give 0 stars if Yelp allows me.

THIS IS INDEED A SHITTY PLACE.

We ordered 2 noodle soups, which by the way is by far the easiest thing on a menu that ppl can possibly order - and they came in about 30 minutes. The noodles are both horrible. You can definitely tell they just put the frozen noodle in the soup without any effort to make it as a presentable dish. When it served, it still like half-cooked instant noodle. It is shocking to us that how a chef can mess up with such a simple dish....

And it is also very pricy, we paid over 50 bucks for 2 bowls of crap. Would never ever go back there again.

The place right next to it, called \"Avenue Cafe\" was ok, we went there on the following day of our trip, although the waiting time was a bit long, but the food was decent."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour. Wanted a bite before our big dinner plans. 2-6pm Sunday - Tuesday. 

The grand hop-tail drink is very tasty and gingery

The futomaki was not great. I expected authentic with bonito flakes and pickled veggies and tamago. This was a miss for me. It was avocado and carrots. I should have asked how they prepared theirs. 

The duck and pine nut in lettuce petal was 5 stars. 

Chicken wings so delightful also a winner! Well balanced-sweet and spicy

The place was empty and the service was nice. We were not in a rush so we just enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"First off the casino had a horrible chemical smell. I'm not sure if they were doing construction or if it always smells like the inside of a cleaning bottle. When the sushi arrived it looked a bit lacking. I hoped the taste would make up for the size, instead of even sub par sushi it tasted like a can of tuna. Bad buffet sushi is so much better then what was made here. I'll never be coming back, and likely being staying clear of the MGM all together after this.

After two rolls we decide to give the Chinese food a try, as we were still starving. The veggie dumpling were good but took over 30 minutes to a arrive (they forgot them), and the Malaysian noodles were good. Nothing great and overpriced for the each.

Sushi 1 star; Chinese 3 star; Service 2 star; Smell 0 star."}
{"text":"The Tom Yum noodle was pretty good and flavorful. Everything is over priced. I asked for some extra lettuce leaves for the Lettuce Wrap appetizer just so that I can finish all the fillings that came with it. Found out later that I got charged $1 for four tiny leaves. Oh well, this is to be expected for the restaurants in the big hotel anyway."}
{"text":"I had a steamed sea bass which was perfectly cooked. Prices were on the high end but loved that we were seated immediately and that food arrived fast."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Hooters Hotel and Casino across the street and was looking for late night sushi, knowing that the pricey Blue Ribbon Sushi at the Cosmopolitan was a Lyft drive and way more expensive, I settled in on the Grand Wok. Service was great. My asian female server was amazingly attentive even though she confused about what draft beer is and steered me toward Tiger beer, even though it came in a  bottle it was great so all good. I had the rainbow roll and the yellowtail roll (Hanasshi?) both were fine. Not great but fine. Edamame was great. And last addition was chicken pot stickers which were tasty especially dipped in the chili sauce.
All in all this was a good stop since it was convenient, great service, good food and really what i needed after traveling from Houston."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at some of the reviews for this place. It wasn't spectacular, but I thought it was really decent for the price. We were on a budget for food and it was hard to find somewhere for dinner that was a little nicer, but only about $50 for two people. 

We ordered the steamed potstickers which were fine. The combination fried rice and the red curry coconut chicken were both really good. Now, I am not rating these on any kind of 'authenticity' scale which I am skeptical of anyway. I thought they had full flavors, not greasy, and were very nicely portioned. 

The atmosphere here was fun, but not as themed as many of the other places in the MGM. I wish it had been a little less crowded, but they have the tables jammed in here. Our server was a little clumsy, but very attentive and very pleasant."}
{"text":"I had to create a Yelp account to warn you...

MGM claims 'Grand Wok' is a casual dining experience. Casual? Yes. Dining? Barely. 

Technically it's edible, though if someone is going to charge a minimum of $22-$30 per dish, I'd expect you could do better than Panda Express (I don't even mind PE sometimes, so that should tell you how sad this experience was).

- Vietnamese Summer Roll: $11 - 99% noodle. 1% Shrimp. Peanut sauce was pretty solid. No veggies at all?
- Wok Seared Pork w/ Udon Noodles & XO Sauce: $22 - Overcooked chewy/slimy pork (\"seared\" is laughable. \"Boiled\" is more accurate), overcooked noodles, bland sauce.
- Kung Pao: $23 - Overcooked chicken, sauce was below average. Even the rice was dry and thin.
- Service was fine. Food came suspiciously fast. BTW, their online menu is priced cheaper than their actual menu.

All told, we paid $70 for some pretty shameful food. We've had good experiences at several other MGM restaurants, so I recommend that you give this one a pass."}
{"text":"The sushi was pretty good but the service was not.  It's a good atmosphere and people are dressed up pretty nice.  Out edamame came out cold and late and it was like the waitress forgot about us. My drink was empty and wasn't refilled once and had to track her down for our bill.  I would prolly try another spot next time."}
{"text":"After me and my friends decided to stay inside MGM grand for dinner, we passed by this restaurant and thought and we are going to try it.  This restaurant is a fusion of chinese, indonesian, japanese, singaporean food.  I ordered the hainanese chicken rice for my dinner and my friends ordered indonesian friend rice and sushi.  I LOVE the indonesian friend rice here because it brings back my memory when i still living back in indonesia. The taste is exactly or similar to the taste back home.  i also love the hainanese chicken rice although it tastes a little bit different from what i had before.  The hainanese chicken rice came in a plate filled with soup, chicken, garlic rice, soycause, and hot chili.  i think the chicken could have been tastier and more flavor.  Overall, the experience was really good."}
{"text":"Came here last week for lunch for an Asian food fix. Being Vegas on the strip, most of the Asian food is always some sort fusion and catered for a specific higher end market.

This place is no different. Their shrimp pho was $19 USD and probably only had about 3 shrimps. The broth did not taste like the phos I normally have either. Just because it is in a dark broth with noodles doesn't make it a \"pho\".

The Grand Wok sushi roll was not too bad. It has Soft-Shell Crab and Spicy Tuna. But again, coming from a city of an abundance of quality sushi, I did not feel it was worth the price. 

I probably would not come back by choice. Even if I was craving Asian food, I think I would rather suck it up and wait a few more days than return here."}
{"text":"Very fast and friendly service! Great sushi! Got the Red Dragon roll, a little spicy but very flavorful yet clean."}
{"text":"Ate here for the very first time and I believe I had food poisoning from the Philadelphia (salmon/cream cheese) sushi rolls. I have been vomiting and having the runs ALL day! I was very dehydrated with body aches. Felt like the flu, but worse. I don't recommend this place for sushi.... It will have you in the hospital =/"}
{"text":"Service is friendly. Food is good, not great. Compared to resort pricing at the other restaurants in the MGM Grand, this is affordable. They don't take reservations so you may have to sit outside by the fountain and slot machines for a while before you can eat."}
{"text":"Impeccable service, delicious food but serving size was not enough for the price. I definitely will return since MGM seems to be a lucky spot for my hubby, this dinner was on MGM, moments before we dined my husband won a hundred bucks out of his twenty dollar bill from the slots. Luck be my man that night."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant out of the many options in the MGM Grand. I only had a Thai Iced Tea and the Sea Dragon sushi. Both were phenomenal! My husband had the Sea bass and the salt and pepper calamari. I enjoyed the calamari but the Sea bass had a lot of bones and tasted really fishy."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentines day dinner, the spicy California sushi roll  was delicious and not too spicy for me. The steamed pot stickers are perfection.  We also had the garlic fried rice.  I wasn't a big fan of the rice but the shrimp that came with the rice was full of flavor and cooked perfectly.  Service was quick and waiters are very friendly.  For being inside a Vegas casino the restaurant was reasonably priced.   

They are located in the MGM Grand Casino and since we were going to the KA Cirque du Soleil show that evening, this is the perfect location only steps from the theater.  We will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Legit Chinese Food on the strip! Super friendly staff especially Manager Jason. Very informative!"}
{"text":"I loved the food, service, and the overall environment. Must try the kung pao it's to die for! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Went here while in Vegas on vacation, not a bad spot. The watermelon juice and their green tea are both quite good. I tried the black dragon eel maki roll to start, it was good simply because eel makes for my favourite maki, but it wasn't stand out good. Then I got the pork udon noodles. These were pretty flavourless. The only flavour really was that of too much salt. The pork was cut in thin noodle-like strips too, which was strange. All in all, certainly not the worst Vegas has to offer."}
{"text":"Great place, first time here with the wife. The mixed mushroom plate was great the sushi was good. 4 stars for the sorbet desert."}
{"text":"This is just okay Asian food and I have dined here several times over the years. The service is okay, not great. 

Every dish we have tried is nothing to brag about but it isn't awful either. The prices are high but not any higher than any other restaurant of this type in Vegas.  

It is conveniently located near the craps tables in the MGM."}
{"text":"My wife and I searched all over yelp for the best sushi place in Vegas and had planned to go somewhere else. But we were staying at MGM all week and finally on the last day decided to try Grand Wok. We were BLOWN Away!! I swear to you that I honestly thought this was some of the best sushi I have ever had. We had the Spicy Tuna Roll and the Dragon Roll. Both were excellent. Also we had the spring rolls for appetizer and we split a Kung Pao Chicken. ALL was Excellent. I don't know if I caught this place on a good day but I was so impressed I knew I had to write a review."}
{"text":"I didn't order the sushi here, so I can't comment on that, but the Chinese food here is pretty decent. Not great, but decent. The wonton soup was all right, the soup base was kind of bland compared to what I expect, and the Orange chicken was disappointing. What I thought was really good, though was the combination fried rice. It was more of a Japanese style fried rice, which is has a lighter, almost crispier rice texture, but this one didn't contain bonito flakes. Like many restaurants on the strip, I wouldn't make a special effort to eat here, but it's good enough to eat at if I'm already at that hotel/casino."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and tasty food!

Annie was my server and she was attentive and very calm. She was kind and took very good care of us. Hostesses at the front were friendly and welcoming as well, they seated me immediately at around 6:30 pm on a weekday.

I got the garlic shrimp fried rice, pork potstickers, and the shrimp tempura roll. Shrimp tempura roll tasted generic, no complaints. Shrimp fried rice was flavorful. I appreciated that it was not soaked in soy sauce, the seasoning was done differently and it tasted more authentic that way. Potstickers were yummy as well. I also ordered the Lychee martini. Delicious and sweet, tasted just like lychee! Food was a little pricy, but I would say the portions and the flavor compensate well.

Ambiance is classy but not too fancy. Casual attire appropriate. They seem to set a standard of service that reflects in any employee you interact with. I enjoyed my time immensely."}
{"text":"Nothing here was \"AMAZING\", but if you're craving some Chinese food and you don't have the means to get to Chinatown here in LV then this would satisfy your cravings for a while. Its comfy, but not the best."}
{"text":"I've been here the last couple of times I was in Las Vegas...

The menu is okay. I definitely wish there was more sushi options, but I've ordered some of the entrees and they are pretty good as well. Def try the Fried rice!

The service here has been kind of Mehh though, everytime I've been here (a year between the times) I think we usually just end up here because they are open later then most of the other places around the hotel."}
{"text":"This place was just okay to me. Out of all the food our group order the calamari appetizer will probably be our favorite but we wouldn't go back just to have it and the ramen soup was okay. Sushi wasn't all that- nothing impressive. The shrimp pad Thai was okay as well again not too impressive. I gave it a 3 star for their service. They were very attentive and our drinks were always full."}
{"text":"I can't believe they survive with so many options around them, I guess that's how it is when your clientele is mostly tourists.
Their sushi taste wise wasn't bad but it looked like an amateur rolled it, the rice around was thin and uneven, not very appealing. Spring roll were nothing to write home about, can get better ones back home for half the price, these 2 dishes actually gave them the additional star.
I also ordered a Tom-Yum soup, that's the reason I chose to eat there, usually it comes spicy, I asked if it's possible to get it mild, they said sure and instead of the tom yum broth they put vegetable broth of some kind, must be from their noodle soup, no lemongrass, no fish sauce, no cilantro, when I asked the server if that's their tom yum soup he said, yes you asked for it not spicy. I got 3 shrimp & rice noodles in a bland broth for $19, instant lunch box of noodles soup would have tasted better.
Do yourself a favor and choose another place to it at."}
{"text":"It's a nice restaurant located in the MGM Grand Hotel.
Nice wooden walk way on the side to get into the restaurant. 
Plenty of tables for small and large groups. 

Their menu books seem to be made of wooden cutting boards.

The waitress is friendly and greets you with all smiles

FOOD:

Pork Udon Noodles $21
This is pretty good. Portion size is a bit bigger than other restaurants. Noodles are flavored well. Good portion of meats and vegetables.

BBQ Combo Plate $27
(BBQ Pork, BBQ Duck and White or Brown Rice)
The BBQ pork was not too sweet but it was dry. The BBQ duck was really good, not too greasy but just enough to still be juicy. It was also nice that the meats were laid on top of a bed of peanuts. The peanuts gave it a slight contrasting taste. The dipping sauce on the side was a very light flavor. Tasted kind of like watered down peanut butter and sweet/sour sauce but still has a gelatinous texture. The brown rice was ok as well. I've definitely had better brown rice.

Red Dragon Roll $18
$20 for a sushi roll is extremely expensive and the worst part was that it was just OK. Definitely nothing special about this roll. Cold rice with raw fish and minimal ingredients. 

Overall they have their good and their bad."}
{"text":"Las Vegas has some great dining, and it just keeps getting better. No matter where you stay, you are surrounded by the next venture created by that celebrity chef that you might see on TV, or by some kitschy type of eatery that lures you in, and in some cases, will disappoint you.

I'm staying at the MGM Grand, and I'm surrounded by some FANTASTIC restaurants, Craftsteak by Tom Collichio, Joel Robuchon, and Seablue by Michael Mina. Sometimes, some of the OTHER great restaurants are often overshadowed by the great names. Last night I decided to take a chance on something new, and less \"popular\" if you will. I went to The Grand Wok & Sushi Bar.

Outside, all you see is giant glass windows with a lot of tables. The inside has a really cool, contemporary design, paired with a great lively energy. This place is energetic, yet not too loud, which is a huge pet peeve of mine. The servers are very attentive, friendly, and fast. I mean really really fast.

Our menu consisted of miso soup to start, followed by a red dragon roll and beef lo mein, and finished with the honey walnut shrimp. Of course we had an ice cold Kirin to wash it all down.

Their miso soup was really good. In fact, it actually stood out to me from the rest that I've had. Usually, miso soup is just a salty broth with some tofu and seaweed. You know, that one thing that helps curb your monstrous appetite during that lengthy period from when you order the sushi until it hits your table. The miso at Grand Wok was really hearty, and lacked the massive salt infusion. The seaweed was of the highest quality, not paper thin, but had good substance.

The red dragon roll was insanely good. I mean, how can you go wrong with tempura shrimp, spicy tuna, spicy masago, and eel sauce? The texture and the finish of eel sauce is what made this sushi amazing.

The beef lo mein was another winner. Perfectly cooked spaghetti noodles with just the right balance of crisp veggies. The beef itself was a bit thicker than you would usually get for this dish. I liked very much.

And now onto the winner of the evening, the honey walnut shrimp. OMG, this is a great dish. It's sweet, sour, crispy, and soft. This dish makes you want to abandon everything you're doing and become a Chinese chef so you can spend years on end perfecting this dish as they have. The shrimp were huge, and evenly coated with the honey sauce, served over a bed of microgreens and crisp, sweet roasted walnuts. When this hit my tongue, I just wanted to shove the entire dish in my mouth and chew for hours. Amazing!

My conclusion of the evening is that sometimes when you're in Las Vegas, you may just have to take that chance and choose one of the less-popular joints. You never know, you may stumble upon that hidden gem.

{"text":"Quick and friendly service.  Good favors were crisp and clean. Sushi was better than a more expensive restaurant in the same hotel"}
{"text":"We actually ate here twice during our stay.  It was awesome both times.  The sushi is really fresh and the service is great.  I highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"Don't go here. The food came out cold and was way overpriced. Cheaper and tastier meals are everywhere in Vegas, so don't give this place another thought. I would suggest going to Panda Express for a more authentic experience. Yes, Panda Express = More Authentic Experience.

For a city filled with Asian gamblers, it was odd to see no other Asian person dinning at an Asian restaurant (always a big negative in my book). Maybe their frequent game play has given then enough comps to dine elsewhere, so I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt as far a demographically biased portion of my rating goes.

I ordered the prix fixe menu where the main course was braised sea bass. The sea bass was more boiled than braised. It was texturally unappealing and had no flavor. The greens that accompanied it were overcooked and essentially dead. 

I really should have just gone to the food court...."}
{"text":"As a longtime MGM Hotel lover, I've had the pleasure to experience The Grand Wok and Sushi Bar on countless stays at the hotel.  I wouln't go so far as to come here from a different hotel, but within MGM, this is a great value and eatery.
In lieu of another buffet or heavy American meal, our group of 14 agreed to meet at Grand Wok for a family-style Chinese meal.  Our dishes included:  Yang-Chow Fried Rice, XO Style Fried Udon and Beef, Chicken Lettuce Wraps, Tom YUm Noodle Soup, Fried Spicy Calamari, Hainan Chicken Rice, and Sauteed Green Beans.  The food was a solid 4 stars all around!
The only bad thing was that each item was so small, that even doubling up on each dish only alloted for about a sampler taste for each person.  At about $18 avg. per dish, this quickly added up for a not very filling meal.  This was okay with us since we had a buffet planned for dinner, but it's definitely something to consider if you are going \"family-style\".  In all my past experiences at the Grand Wok in smaller groups, everyone ordered their own dish + some appetizers.  
Service was good.  We were seated immediately and attended to at all times.  It's a mainstay at The MGM that I can appreciate!"}
{"text":"Pros: None
Cons: Food, Price
Overall: Do yourself a favor - use the MGM Grand's Casino Entrance/Exit, turn right, and take the 3 minute walk to Panda Express.

My fam and I were craving some Chinese food so we went here at the recommendation of my cousin who frequents Vegas and says this is the closest Chinese restaurant and pretty good (we were staying at the MGM anyway)

Wow, was he wrong! First off, I don't eat seafood, so I can't comment on that - which dominates a lot of their menu items.  But here's what we did have

Mongolian Beef - This was the only good dish I sampled. However, this is NOT mongolian beef. They're like mini steaks. It tasted good, like duck actually, and it was very tender. However, it was nowhere near Mongolian beef. I did like the sauce that came with it since it was infused with a slight hint of habanero. But this was not Mongolian beef in the slightest.

\"Chow fun\" (Beef rice noodle with soy sauce) - they weren't kidding. It was just that. No other real flavorings, just soy sauce. No attempt at making a delicious sauce. Just take some kikoman or something and pour it over noodles, fry it for 5 seconds and serve. Wow. bad.

Combination Fried Rice - What the hell is with all these beans? There was like no meat in my dish. Who does this? Really????

Honey Walnut Shrimp - My cousin's favorite dish. He enjoyed it. I enjoyed the walnut.

Additionally - no free refills on soda. I mean, I'd expect that at a Pho restaurant, but not a crappy expensive Chinese restaurant. (I guess it's not really Chinese, but \"Asian Fusion\" - Asian fused with crap)

For those that enjoy Chinese food, you know it's about the large, family-sized portions. I didn't expect much of that here, but for the price they make you pay, they surely don't delivery in either quality or quantity.

Overall this place sucks, and it left such a bad memory in my head, that I went to Panda Express the morning after and had a much more satisfying meal for less. Do yourself a favor - use the MGM Grand's Casino Entrance/Exit, turn right, and take the 3 minute walk to Panda Express."}
{"text":"OVERPRICED. Sushi wasn't bad; fish was fresh enough but absolutely nothing special (\"meh\" came to mind), especially for how much it costs and how much you get. Appetizer was extremely small. Mainly what turned me off to this place was that the service was terrible. The server hardly spoke to us, did not bring us another pair of chopsticks after nicely requesting them several times, and when we asked for the check, we were brought an empty book. This all could have been smoothed over with an apology, but alas, there was none. She did not check in on how our food was or it we needed anything else, and there was no \"thank you for coming\" at the end of the meal.  I do not recommend this place, there are far better options."}
{"text":"I liked this place. 

I was in a party of 4 and we all split the Orange Chicken, Pad Thai, and Kung Pao Chicken. (Chicken dishes came with rice in a very small bowl.)

For the price of each (and I know it's Vegas) but I do feel that they were over priced for the portions you get. It was quite expensive for a little bit of food. I was still hungry when I left.

Orange Chicken: Delicious!!!! It's hard to go wrong with this dish. It's one of my favorites. The sauce was gingery with great orange flavor with real orange peel and the chicken was perfectly crispy and wonderful.

Kung Pao: Great dish. Had a kick of spice to it and a lot of peanuts. Very good.

Pad Thai: It was alright. I know that Pad Thai has egg in it, but this dish was just extra eggy and lacking in other flavors and texture of classic Pad Thai. I wouldn't get this one again.

Overall, I'm glad we stopped here to get our food fix!"}
{"text":"Everytime and friend of mines comes to town we always come to eat here because the staff is amazing(especially the manager) and the rolls are awesome!  Last time we were here the manager allowed us to be seated, even though it was close to closing, and gave us free desert.  She is an amazing person...MmmmMMmmm, it's pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for the quality but it was not bad ! I actually give this place a 3.5 .. Our server didn't once come over and ask us how we're doing or anything. She actually forgot my order of soup and I had to ask her mid meal.. She said sorry, I'm getting old lol.. -_- Got an egg drop soup that was $8 and it was the size of typical Japanese restaurant complimentary miso soup size . I guess when in Vegas.....I know there's a more upscale sushi spot in the Mgm called shibuya, but this place will do. I like how there's Chinese food as well. Will come back and try again .."}
{"text":"Went to the Grand Wok on a whim. Their sushi was very fresh and main plates were great. Service was on point Asian. 
The ambiance was excellent. Go there."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food, more affordable than the other restaurants at MGM. I had wok fried noodles with beef and the shrimp tempura roll. Both were decent. My boyfriend had the Orange Chicken, which was more like sweet and sour chicken, but it was still pretty good."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Slow service mediocre food. Ur in vegas bump up ur game. Closed with fortune cookies.."}
{"text":"I have no idea why other people gave this restaurant low reviews, the food was amazingly good!!! I regularly eat Asian food at various places over the years and the food here was not only tasty but fresh, abundant sized portions and the menu offered a variety of dishes from spicy to sweet. My only complaint however is the prices are a little high but that's what I would expect in Vegas. Definitely will be coming here again."}
{"text":"Love this place. I just got back from Vegas and was at the MGM looking for a casual place to dine. My wife wanted sushi so we went to the Grand Wok. The food and service was excellent. The best Mongolian beef I've ever had. It was tender and cooked to perfection. The sushi was also a blast. Definitely check this place out. The prices are modest."}
{"text":"Wandered on by after the Canelo v. GGG fight. I was enticed by the menu, especially as a Chinese person. I was weary of the steep prices, but figured the food would at least be good. I got the salted fish chicken fried rice and boo got the beef udon, roughly $24 each. If it weren't for the salted fish, the fried rice would be completely bland. The rice itself had no color. I felt like everything was merely cooked enough just to be edible. Again, I wasn't expecting knock your socks off authentic food, but I did expect higher quality, especially as the staff and cooks were Asian. What was more disappointing was the apparent Oolong tea. It tasted like a light green tea and when I inquired, our server assured us that that was the right tea. I'd like to think I know my teas and that was no Oolong. I even had better tea at the Northside Café at the SLS. Our service overall was fine. The only redeeming quality of our experience was meeting Dan Rafael who stopped by for dinner himself."}
{"text":"Went for a quick bite and beer.  We ordered the pork pot stickers and the Rainbow roll. Pot stickers were yummy, but they served 5 instead of 6 so they could be shared equally. The rainbow roll had Atlantic salmon, avocado and cream cheese (my date's favorite ingredients and it was very fresh and the rice was perfect.  The wasabi   and ginger were also very fresh. The waiter was extremely attentive without being bothersome. Decor was very nice."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some Asian food after spending two days eating mostly burgers and sandwiches. Grand Wok was able to seat us right away on a Saturday night and all four people in my group really enjoyed their food. I had the Kung Pao chicken and it was very tasty. The food came out quickly and the service was profesional. Overall, I would definitely recommend you check out Grand Wok if you want Asian and you are in the MGM."}
{"text":"Food was high quality; I had the spring rolls, salmon sashimi, and chicken lettuce wraps. My only complaints was that the food was a bit overpriced because of the status of being at MGM Grand, and the service was difficult. The server kept leaving for extended periods of time without checking on my table. P.S. I had a glass of the Sauvignon Blanc, which was excellent as well."}
{"text":"By far one of the most disappointing dining experiences I've had in  long time. After reading some of the other reviews it seems the reasons behind my bad visit were shared by others. So it's clear it is just the way the restaurant is vs a one off situation.  What's a little more disheartening is that each negative  situation was responded to by some sort of management with the implication that it would be addressed and corrected, clearly a cookie cutter reply. 

We were greeted by the hostess and seated right away, soon after we were greeted by our server. She took our order which consisted of 2 appetizers (calamari & pot stickers), a California roll and Tom Yum soup. After 35 minutes our appetizers and california rolls finally arrive, about 10 minutes later i ask where the soup is (mind you it's been 45 minutes since we actually ordered it)..yes irritated I cancel the soup order and ask for the check. What bothers me the most is I asked to speak to a manager and one never came. The server gave us the check, apologized since she could clearly sense my annoyance. 

I understand restaurants can run behind but not once we're we even told, explained to or even addressed with the fact the kitchen may have been running behind and we had clearly been waiting over half and hour for appetizers. Not that I would have believed it anyways considering the table that was next to us and seated after us, was half way through their meals by the time I cancelled the rest of our food. 

Honestly, the food (what we actually got) was pretty good. The calamari was very tasty. 

As far as ambiance it does remind me of an Asian inspired cafe. I do feel the food is a bit overpriced for what it is. Shibuya was my absolute go to for but sadly it closed so I think we will wait for Morimoto to open if we want Asian food at MGM."}
{"text":"I don't know if I've ever had a better dining experience in my life. I absolutely love this place. 

I was scared as I wandered up to the hostess stand and asked the woman if they had anything gluten free. Asian food is scary for people like me who have to eat gluten free, but the Grand Wok was the only place open. To my surprise, the hostess whipped out a gluten free menu that had SOOO many options. I mean, Grand Wok seriously gave PF Changs a run for their money. When we were seated, our waiter, Leo, was super attentive and double checked to make sure that the sweet and sour chicken truly was gluten free. He kept our waters filled, brought our food out less than ten minutes after we ordered, and overall just took this place from a slightly pricey Asian restaurant to a place I really want to come back to. 

Leo, you're awesome. Keep doing what you're doing. This place is definitely going to be a must-stop next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Place was ok. Nothing memorable about the visit, if you dine here maybe go with the non sushi choices, felt like I actually have had better rolls from trader Joe's. Waitress also forgot part of my order but that brought right after we asked for the check. Don't think ill be coming back during my next Vegas trip"}
{"text":"Service was excellent but the food was mediocre at best. We got 3 rolls, egg drop soup, a few pieces of nigiri, and chicken low mein, and just water, and our bill was about $100. The soup lacked any flavor. I got the basic shrimp tempura roll but again, no flavor and the shrimp wasn't crispy/warm. Boyfriend's rolls didn't look appetizing but didn't try them. Not impressed and shoulda listened to the other reviews but we wanted to make it easy and just eat at the hotel."}
{"text":"I'm back in Vegas this time with the hubby and needed a quick fix dinner and we wanted Chinese food before heading back to the airport to fly back to the bay area.  Since I've been here before, I thought what the heck, I know it's decent.  

This time however, the food was lacking big time in flavor.  Chow fun was not good, the won ton noodle soup was all just broth and no flavor.  Even the poor little dumplings didn't taste good.  We also order the miniature spring rolls.  When I say miniature, I'm not kidding.  Check out the pictures.  

I won't be coming back for a third time."}
{"text":"Inside of the MGM, open late, great customer service,  and wonderful cuisine.  If you love great sushi and drinks,  then this is a must.   It's pricey but worth it. 

It was my girlfriend and my first time,  but we will be back."}
{"text":"I'm amazed this place has good reviews. Rubbery gross orange chicken, worst pad Thai I've ever had, my soup never came and they didn't even comp it. This was my last meal in Vegas and I am sooo disappointed  :("}
{"text":"the people who work here are all cantonese.  the food was like cheap chinese food / american chinese food.  and sushi.  when can you get sushi and chinese food in one place?  vegas i guess.

i had the chicken lettuce wraps.  seafood tofu chowder (which is not really a chowder but just a soup).  scallop, mayo, tobiko sushi roll.  the food was not too bad.  the sushi was falling apart.  food here is of course overpriced."}
{"text":"YUM! This place was great! Friendly service, yummy food, comfortable atmosphere... what more could you ask for?

My husband and I found our way here after seeing Ka in the MGM. I was in the mood for noodles, so we decided to try this place. I'm so glad that we did! Our waitress was super friendly and helpful.

We ordered the calamari to start. It was great. The sauce really made the dish. The hot peppers were HOT. I can handle heat, but these were another level.

For dinner, I had the Tom Yum and my husband had Orange Chicken. Both were DELICIOUS! He said his could have used less rice or more sauce, but the flavor was amazing. My Tom Yum was perfect. Huge shrimp, huge mushrooms, and yummy broth."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Prices were a bit better than most of the restaurants at the MGM.  Service was excellent.  Got there pretty late and sat right away."}
{"text":"Rather expensive for Cantonese and sushi but, nice atmosphere, good service and considering its location inside MGM, reasonably priced. We enjoyed a nice dinner here before going to see Ka. They don't accept reservations. It's first come, first served. We arrived around 5 pm on a Saturday night and had no problem getting a table. In fact it wouldn't have been an issue if we'd have arrived at 6."}
{"text":"This 5 star review is absolutely deserving!! Tucked away in the MGM hotel, Grand Wok is a place you may just pass by without even noticing... For casual Asian dining, the food was absolutely incredible, delicious and 100% satisfying. I stumbled across it by chance after an evening show and it really hit the spot. I highly recommend the Shrimp & Pork Wonton Noodle Soup . The service was top notch with the utmost respect from the very sincere host. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Convenient for getting soup for that hangover when you've got little time to waste.  And you're staying in the MGM Grand.

I ordered the pork and shrimp wonton noodle soup because it sounded comforting and easy on the stomach.  I wanted to order the fusiony lobster and leek ramen but it was a stir-fried rather than in a soup. Anyway, the wonton noodle soup indeed did the trick.  The best part were the wontons, with half pieces of shrimp in them.  They were super plump with a good firmness.  The broth was a little bland, but they offered chili garlic sauce on the side.  I added some as well as some soy sauce, which made it a lot more savory.  Still, a very simple broth though.

The boy ordered the Mandarin beef noodle soup, which was full of beef and delicous melt-in-your-mouth tendon attached.  It was so tender that it was almost like fat, but without the fat.  The broth was five-spice based but good, especially with the chili garlic sauce.  I secretly wished I had ordered it, and it caught the attention of our neighbors, who asked what it was.

Service was very warm and excellent.  Recommend sitting at the bar to watch everything being made."}
{"text":"I found this place while searching for sushi venues in Vegas as we are both sushi fans and definitely wanted to get some sushi dining in during our stay.  This was probably one of our most favorite dining experiences of the trip.  It had such a nice, warm atmosphere that created a wonderfully romantic dining experience.

I notice a lot of commentary about the prices, but it is Vegas, and this is in one of the main hotels on the Strip (although I thought the MGM Grand seemed a bit run down at the time).  At any rate - the service seemed fine, and our server was super sweet and cordial.  The food came out as planned with exception to one roll, which was missed.  I don't recall everything we ordered but can guarantee a philly roll was involved if it was on the menu.

Overall - the food tasted great and service was excellent.  We really enjoyed our dinner and was probably one of the most memorable of the trip.  Will definitely return if we ever go back to Vegas in the near future."}
{"text":"This was the last restaurant my wife and I ate at before we went back to Houston and it was a huge disappointment. There was nothing authentic or Asian about this restaurant. The food didn't taste right and was very bland. I can't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Black sesame dessert and mixed mushrooms with rice are the best. Come here just for those every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"We came to the Grand Wok for dinner before hitting the clubs at my bachelorette party. We had a party of 6 with no reservation (they only take reservations for very large parties) and got a table right away. The place has a great atmosphere, and was a little quiet when we were there, which was nice b/c we could actually all have a conversation. 
We each ordered different sushi rolls, which we all pretty average price wise. Most rolls ran around $12-$18 which was great for the size of the rolls and the ingredients. I had the Red Dragon roll and it was sooo yummy! Actually all of the rolls were great and everyone in our party was super happy with what they ordered. We also shared an order of Orange Chicken, which didn't come with rice (weird) and was tasty but had a different texture than Orange Chicken i've had before... a little weird, but not bad. We also ordered the Combination Fried Rice which had all kinds of goodies in it like lobster, shrimp, pork, chicken... basically all the meats you can think of... it was super tasty but it was way over priced, $18 for a plate of rice that might not even fill up one person :( 
Or bill for 6 came to around $170 which is pretty great for sushi on the strip! Service was prompt and the food was delish! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to grab sushi w/ out breaking the bank!"}
{"text":"I'm no sushi expert... well maybe...

What I ate:
Sake (salmon) nigiri 2 piece $8:50
Alaskan Roll $13.00
Cost:  Son Of A B*&$#!!! Expensive for no reason, except its in MGM
Quality:  I could've bought some damn salmon from a store and made it myself and would be good as what I ate today.  Though, I might not prepare it right get myself food poison, but taste would be the same or better.

Atmosphere is ok, somewhat contemporary.  I don't really care for this place and probably not... wait... I will definitely not go back there.

I'm speechless for the how much i paid for the food that was... sub par.
I was hoping for i would get really good sushi and some fire works for what i paid for.  AND their fatty tuna (toro) is $38.00 for two peices... overpriced?  overpriced is understatement."}
{"text":"Really not impressed here. Server Lai-hai was uneducated on the menu, unpleasant and acted like having us there was an inconvenience. She never came back after we received our food. 

We are staying here in the hotel. 

This would be a four star review but crap ruined that.

Ps talked to the manager after \"we are one of the highest reviewed Asian restaurants on the strip\" yeah with a 3 star average with 300+ reviews ;) Tony Diaz. He was argumentative and unhelpful."}
{"text":"This is a very good sushi restaurant. Not the best I have had in Vegas but defiantly top 3. A little pricey but worth it. A great place to take a date. Not a first though, to loud. If your on the strip and want good sushi, check this place out"}
{"text":"Great fresh sushi better than nobu. Service ok. Sushi chef awesome, I couldn't decide which sushi I wanted and was too full to get two more orders so he suggested that he give me one of each.  Awesome! Casual atmosphere so you don't have to worry about dressing up if you are just out to gamble.  My husband and I met some really nice people at the sushi bar.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Our meal was ok, at least it was inexpensive.  We chose to go here as a last option on a Saturday night before a concert in the MGM Arena.  All the other places were either too expensive or had a long wait.  And, we didn't want to eat in the food court.  

We had a 20 minute wait and then got a small table along the windows over the casino.  I ordered the Red Curry Coconut Chicken and the hubby got the Honey Walnut Shrimp. 

I thought the chicken dish was a little too bland, but I liked the shrimp.  We ended up trading dishes.  He ended up liking mine so it was a win-win situation.

I'd be interesting in eating here again and trying some other dishes."}
{"text":"Took my parents here since it was conveniently located in the MGM casino floor. 

Had the lettuce wraps which were tasty but had more carrots and nuts than chicken. Portion was a decent size.

We shared the chicken lo mien and the Mongolian beef. The lo mien was really good. The Mongolian beef needed more seasoning. All and all it meet our expectations. 

The service could have been better. Spent most of my time trying to flag a waitress to get our bill. Also our waitress forgot to tell us she was leaving. She never came back after serving our food. Taking a star away for that reason.

3 Bams out of 5 Bams"}
{"text":"Solid variety of options, on the pricey side. We had sushi, chicken lettuce wraps, and a shrimp noodle dish. The food was good, but not quite authentic the way pan-asian places often are."}
{"text":"Solid Asian restaurant in the MGM.  It's open late and has a decent sushi menu and very good mixed drinks."}
{"text":"I got food to-go from here before and it was not good. The food was sloppy and the sushi did not taste fresh. Too much sauce on the hot dishes, the fried rice was a ton of rice not mixed well at all. Feels like a fast food spot. Maybe it's better to eat there. There too many amazing food options in Vegas to settle here."}
{"text":"We came here on the first night we arrived at the MGM Grand for an extended weekend stay.  I was craving sushi so we decided to give The Grand Wok and Sushi Bar a try.

Service was good, and probably the only good thing about our experience here.   When they ask you if you want to eat at the sushi bar, don't expect to watch them make it for you.  We noticed that the refrigerator in front of our chairs simply had some ornamental items in it.   We decided to order potstickers and sushi.

Potstickers were ok, a little bland but the excellent chili sauce helped change that.

The sushi however was a different story.  All the rolls came out at once so there really isn't a point to the sushi bar, you'll be more comfortable sitting at a table.

We ordered:  1 order of unagi, a Las Vegas Roll, Red Dragon Roll and a Sea Dragon roll.
The unagi was decent, good flavor and cooked well.

The Las Vegas roll (deep-fried tuna, salmon, crab and yellowtail) was downright disgusting.  The 'deep fried tuna' tasted like day old overcooked microwaved chicken.    It made for a odd and unpleasant experience.  

The Red Dragon Roll (tempura shrimp, spicy tuna, spicy masago and eel sauce) was about the only roll we enjoyed.   The fish tasted good but the rice was the same strange tough consistency.  The roll, again, was loose and just fell apart.  The tempura on the shrimp was mushy, not crispy so I assume it had been sitting there before they made the roll.

The Sea Dragon roll (tempura Shrimp, eel, roasted garlic, spicy masago, and eel sauce) was not appetizing either.  Tempura shrimp was mushy and the roll had actual garlic cloves in it which I didn't think was a great idea since they were somewhat bitter.

We had a glass of plum wine and a tall Sapporo and the bill was north of $100.  

Moral of the story - there are plenty of good places to eat at the MGM Grand - \"The Grand Wok and Sushi Bar\" isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Went here with two friends over the weekend because I was craving sushi...what a DISAPOINTMENT!!!!YUCKK TO EVERYTHING WE TRIED!!!
I cannot understand how there were only 3-4 other tables full in this place and the service was still slow.
We sat at our table and opened the little jar and the soy sauce was completely empty,our waiter swapped it with another table and didn't say sorry or anything.OK!
We ordered 3 rolls and one pad thai sprimp:
Sushi rolls:The rice was soooo dry and disgusting I wish I would have just ate at McDonalds no joke!!!The tempura shrimp in each roll was so hard and not crispy like how it should be you could taste that it was either made yesturday or at 5am today Blaahhh so gross!!
Will NEVER return or recommend to others in vegas!"}
{"text":"I came during their lunch special. Their special, for a flat price you get to select 3 food items from the menu. I could have eaten everything on the menu. Keep in mind this is Vegas so the prices are a little higher than usual for Japanese food.

The food was great and the service was on point. My server was trying to fatten me up. All his food recommendations were spot on. The next time I am in vegas I will be stopping by here again."}
{"text":"Pricey and slow service, but really wanted a sushi snack and this was it.

If it's comp'd what you gonna do?  Thank goodness for comps.  but if not comp'd I won't be here.  But it is Vegas, and you know you have to pay the resort fee.  And they know most are charging it to the room.  So either earn it on the tables or charge it to the game!"}
{"text":"The price is a bit high for what you get, but the tastes of the Chinese noodles were right on. 
Also tried the sea dragon roll which was pretty good, still a tad overpriced. 
If you are not willing to get out and drive to china town (rather close to the strip actually) then this is a pretty good place to get some authentic good Chinese food and sushi. It was also a nice view in the back overlooking the casino floor."}
{"text":"3* food. 4* fun.

After a long afternoon walking the strip, bearing the July heat, Sarah E. and I decided on a clean and refreshing sushi dinner for the night, especially after doing well and walking away with a little extra cash from a fun run at Pai Gow Poker.

Sushi might not be the first thing to come to mind in the middle of the desert, but its Vegas.

We stepped into Grand Wok & Sushi Bar rather than seek out the better-rated Shibuya (also located somewhere in MGM). The place was busy with people, though being a Tuesday evening, it seemed like everything was winding down a little early.

The host was congenial, seating us at the [sushi] bar with a smile. While one member of the waitstaff brought by hot hand towels, our friendly waitress eagerly awaited our orders. 

First order of business, as ever; sake and beer.

Browsing the menu, we ordered the Sea Dragon, Negihama, and Aloha rolls [ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ntfDRwVlUb3nmWdMdPjq0Q?select=w-AVf1Ie6e7VzXxR1KQtzw ] to accompany our sake/beer/sake/beer. The sushi itself isn't particularly rave worthy, but its decent in quality and quantity. The Aloha roll (Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon - over spicy Tuna) satisfies, the Negihama (Yellowtail over scallion) is simple and clean, while the Sea Dragon dances on the tastebuds with both garlicky kick and sweet sauce.

On food alone, Grand Wok/Sushi is okay, but the treat of the evening was sitting at the bar and watching the mastery of sushi-preparer Yoshi [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ntfDRwVlUb3nmWdMdPjq0Q?select=lidb5EFyc-cEwfsK-kq-hw ]; we sat there, watching in admiration, as he prepared order after order of sushi and sashimi. At the end of the evening, as Yoshi was preparing and order of glistening, fatty toro, he noticed our awe (drooly want!) and treated us to a couple of melt-in-your-mouth slices.

Ending the evening on a high note and an unexpected morsel of fatty tuna goodness? Fourth star.

{"text":"If you want quality food and priced fairly well for being in the strip then is the place for you. A hidden gem inside the MGM. Way better then Morimoto."}
{"text":"Do not go here!!  Don't know what happened or why, but the service we got was horrendous, as was most of the food we ordered.  We started out with a sushi appetizer, the Hola roll, with salmon, tuna, spicy tuna and yellowtail.  It was the only good thing about the meal.  And it was the only order which came on time.  Then the waitress returned to take our orders.  We waited about 30 minutes, and then we flagged the waitress to ask for the food to be brought over, and she said it would be ready in 45 minutes.  We told her that was going to be too late, and soon  food was brought to the table.  However, things went from bad to worse.  Several guests did not receive any food, yet everyone got checks!  And an 18% gratuity was added on to the bill.  Of the food that did arrive, the stir fried beef was raw inside, not medium rare, RAW!  And the Dragon roll which was supposed to have spicy masago,had no masago, and the shrimp tempura tasted about a week old.  It was dry and the eel was just average.  It just wasn't worth the outing."}
{"text":"There's nothing like wonton soup to cure my hang over.  Especially in vegas, I'm pretty much nursing a hangover everyday.  After a looong day of trade show booth duty, I welcomed this soupy, noodley, shrimpey and porkey goodness.  It wasn't too steep for a vegas restuarant.  I think it was like $11 for it. 

The other had sushi and nobody complained but then again, we were all hungry and hungover.  Gotta add that disclaimer. :)"}
{"text":"This is like Chinese food on crack. So good. Or maybe I'm just hungry. Whatever the case is, here's what I base my 5 stars rating on:
- eggplant garlic dish
- pork belly (on chef's recommendation list)
- beef with bell peppers 
- tofu with mushroom
Yum! Too bad the second time I came back for dinner this place was closed :(
Price is expensive in real-life terms but affordable in crazy-christmas-in-vegas terms if you get what I mean ha ha"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wound up eating here since some of the other places seemed much too expensive. Don't get me wrong, it was over $60 for the two of us including tip, but it was pretty worth it. I had two excellent sushi rolls and my boyfriend had the kung pao chicken, which was also great. Service was a little off, although our server did seem kind of busy to her credit. I really enjoyed the atmosphere there. We sat in a kind of separate area where there was a large wall made of black stones with water running down. It was really beautiful. I'd recommend this if you want to eat in MGM Grand!"}
{"text":"We came here questioning ourselves because of the reviews. We arrived and promptly were seated. Service was great. Ordered Kung pao chicken and two sushi rolls. Everything was delicious. Many complain about the price but HELLO you are in Las Vegas you should expect to pay a bit more!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the ratings are so low for this place. Maybe because it's near all these fancy schmancy places in the MGM. Maybe it's that strip mall-sounding name. But the food is actually really good. Just don't come for the sushi. It's more of a Chinese place and the rolls are very sloppy. Otherwise I totally recommend it!"}
{"text":"Dude, totally didn't realize how many lesboz are in Vegas. But they're like the totally stereotypical mullet-wearing, jean vest with ripped sleeves wearing, big arms type of galz. You know, have you seen that movie Monster with Christina Ricci and Charlize Theron? Well, that type.

Am I seriously the only hot one? Hehe jk.

Sushi's alright. But who pays $15-17 for a roll of fish?
For that money, you can go to Oakland and get yourself some

{"text":"If I had to describe it in one word I would say DELICIOUS!! I got the aloha which is spicy tuna with either salmon, tuna or yellowtail (i think but it could of been something else) on top and it exceeded my expectations. My dinner companion got the spicy tuna which was also amazing. To top it off we had a salad with seaweed salad, pieces of fish (salmon tuna and something else) with lettuce and crunchy noodles on top (see pic below). Overall service was very good and we sat at the bar. Food was fantastic probably the best sushi I've had (and I've had a lot of sushi) and it was just the right amount of food and it is for sure a five star restaurant.  I would give it more stars if I could. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"An expensive Asian restaurant that just happened to be in the middle of a casino - that's Grand Wok for you. 

I went here with my boyfriend for lunch on a Wednesday. The service here was excellent. Our server kept pouring us tea and I appreciate that he paid that much attention to us. Really commendable. I was just not impressed by the food. 

For appetizers, we had the chicken lettuce cups. The flavor was good and the amount of chicken was more than adequate. They even asked if we wanted more lettuce when we finished the plate and still had some chicken left. For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered three different rolls of sushi (totally forgot to take note of them) and I ordered the XO pork udon noodles. Everything tasted great just nothing impressive. It is just typical Chinese/Japanese food. 

Our bill ended up at around $40/person. For that much you can eat at any quality all-you-can eat restaurant elsewhere. I think it was just the ambience that you pay for here not exactly the food."}
{"text":"This place is a really amazing value for where it is on the strip.  The food is consistently good and you won't break the bank going here.  I highly recommend the mongolian beef.  It has the perfect texture that you look for when you think \"man, I really want to go for some mongolian beef now.\"  Their sushi is adequate.  I'd say forego the sushi for their hot items(not to say the sushi is bad...its just that the hot items are better)."}
{"text":"Good service & good food.  The only reason why i didn't give them a higher rating because of the prices.  Wish it was more affordable."}
{"text":"I can't believe there is a restaurant on the Strip that actually offers Hainanese chicken rice. This is such a niche \"Asian\" dish for a place like downtown Vegas. Anyway, I went right in and tried it (I LOVE Hainanese Chicken Rice like a fat kid loves cake). It's a $26 meal with a 1/2 chicken that comes with the usual: ginger & garlic sauce, chili sauce, chicken fragrance rice and a small bowl of chicken soup. No they didn't debone the chicken like the original style in Singapore. No they didn't cool down the boiled chicken inside iced water to enhance the tenderness of the meat. For that reason I have to remove 2 stars from this review, but the rest was good - cozy vibe/unpretentious decor, friendly staff, decent price for Vegas. A good place for single diner who prefers a quick meal with some home-style Asian food than cheesy burger or heavy steak while you're on business trip in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre and expensive for what it is.  The pad thai barely resembled the pad thai that I know and love, and the sushi was average at best.  The service was horrendous.  We saw several tables around us receive their food before us, even though we were sat down well before them."}
{"text":"We ate here after seeing Ka and had a great meal! The fried rice was wonderful and we also had some great sushi here. The price was great too for the amount of food we got! We will definitely come back if we stay at MGM again."}
{"text":"Another case of \"I'd like to give it a 3.5.\"

Spicy mess of noodles, cucumber salad and big cup of sake were all tasty, and my server was sweet and on the ball.  The vibe was mellow and no one seemed to care that I lingered by myself for an hour and a half with work papers spread across a table for four.

I shelled out about twice as much as I'd expect to on home turf, ($15 for noodles!?) but y'know, it's Vegas, baby.

The only disappointment was the promised \"cascading waterfall and polished stone pond\"--where were they?  I mean, where can a frigging waterfall hide?"}
{"text":"Great prices on on rolls. Very fresh. We had the salmon and spider roll. Both were delicious.

A little pricey for a pot of tea! $8

Overall good place to dine."}
{"text":"I just have one word say about this place... HAM?

My friends and I went for an 11:30pm dinner. Here was the dialogue with our server (she was uber-nice but ESL):

Friend: Can you tell me what's in the Singapore Curry Rice Noodle dish?
Server: Shwimp and Hahm.
Friend: Ham?
Server: Yes, Hahm.
Friend: I'm sorry, did you say Ham?
Server: Yes, Hahm.

All this strange talk of ham snapped me out of my coma-like daydreaming state:

Me: Did you say that this dish has ham in it?
Server: Yes, Hahm!!
Me: Wait, are you saying Ham like H-A-M?
Server: Yah! Hahm! Like Pohrk!
Me: Ah, ok... now I see.

Does the Singapore Curry Rice Noodle dish (which could be mistaken for a vegetarian item) have shrimp and Logan's Farm Honey Baked Ham? Or is it shrimp and pieces of Hormel cold cuts? Perhaps it's simply shrimp and pork, which doesn't sound quite so odd. In any case, we decided to steer clear of the ham and got some sushi and pad thai. 

The sushi and pad thai were nothing to Yelp about but not bad. Perhaps we totally missed out on some spectacular meal by opting out of the Singapore Curry Rice Noodle. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here Friday night.  The sushi rolls were excellent.  Also had the Uni Sashimi, best I've ever tasted.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"So I guess not because it is in the MGM is gonna be a 10.
We didn't find table for walk ins at the Morimoto. So we tried this one which is near.
The service was a little slow and the recommendation of Orange Chicken was not the best. The other plates were just OK. Price was high for this kind of dinner! The amount was fair however."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here last Saturday, 2/18/2012, for a late night snack because we were waiting for taxi traffic to die down after a show at the MGM Grand and I was craving soup. The place was very clean, but the thing I liked the most was being able to people watch through the large windowed walls. Both the hostess and server were both really friendly. Our server was a sweet older Asian lady that made me enjoy my time there, but she was a bit hard to understand at times.

The steamed pork dumplings were soft and had a sweet flavor to it rather than savory. The Aloha roll was okay. The spicy tuna had a nice kick to it, but the quality of sushi was just okay. There were too many sesame seeds on the roll that it overpowered the other flavors. The wonton soup was half egg noodles and the other half was wontons, which was to my surprise. I really liked the fact that there were so many wontons which tasted okay. The broth had a light flavor to it and was just okay. Their chili garlic sauce that I added had a really spicy with a nice garlic aftertaste. 

On a side note, the silly thing I liked here was the double sided chopsticks.

Overall, the server was nice and attentive. The food was just okay: the portions were okay and it had flavor but just nothing to brag about. Although I would not recommend the sushi at all. Please keep in mind you're paying more for the convenience fee of having Americanized Asian food right on the strip. So this was fast, convenient, helped kill time, and was actually better than I was expecting. However, I don't think I would come here again."}
{"text":"The service here is friendly and efficient, the food fresh with a number of vegetarian options and the prices very reasonable. The $9 glass of sauvignon Blanc was very good."}
{"text":"Extremely over priced for Chinese food.. not breaking any molds here at all. The water feature on the wall is pretty cool and the space is pleasant. Service was as good as you'd find at most Chinese restaurants, polite and courteous. 

I was craving tofu in a serious way but the only tofu they had on the menu was in a seafood soup. Disappointing but not unexpected. 

Note.. there is a cheapie Chinese place over in the food bar area."}
{"text":"The red dragon and the spicy tuna was really good. My hubby enjoyed the salt and pepper calamari. The ambiance was busy but nice. The staff was courteous. We were seated and served quickly. I would return."}
{"text":"Well below average especially for the price. Maybe I'm spoiled in San Diego but this place was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"after eating bread and cheese for 3 days straight, i felt the need to eat something \"asian\" (as asian as it can get in a vegas hotel!).  we came here on new yrs eve after watching KA, and it was crowded!  we were able to snag seats at the bar immediately tho.  

i had the tom yum noodle soup w/ 3 gigantic shrimps, and the bf got singaporean curry rice noodles.  both were tasty and hit the spot."}
{"text":"I was craving some Asian food in between my poker playing at the MGM, so I walked into the Grand Wok a little before noon.  This was the swankiest Asian place I've ever eaten at, although considering I was in Vegas, it was probably about par.  Service was excellent.  I ordered some salt and pepper calamari to start.  The strong garlic flavor was welcome, but they must've used some frozen squid, because it was kind of chewy.  More importantly, where were my tentacles?!  The plate was filled with little rings, not one tentacle in sight.  boo.  The second dish I ordered was quite enjoyable.  I had the dried scallop, duck, and seafood e-mein.  All of the seafood (shrimp and scallops) were cooked perfectly, not overdone at all.  This was exactly what my stomach was craving.  After filling up with the yummy noodles, I was satisfied and had the energy to go attack the tables again."}
{"text":"Have enjoyed this place 3 times. Everything me and party had each time was great!

Sort of an Americanized Asian joint. If you ask me, I prefer it. It's clean!

It's Vegas, so the prices are very fitting. 

Service was a bit slow, being a Sat nite that we came.

Think of this place as a PF Chang's with more flavor to the food."}
{"text":"Excellent taste! Mandarin seafood noodles ; Aloha sushi roll; Shrimp Pad Thai."}
{"text":"This was the only sushi restaurant we could find open in Las Vegas at 11:30am....  All the others opened at 5:00pm. We had to take two trams to get to the MGM, but it was worth it!  The service was excellent and so was the food."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with our server - he was serving the entire dining area and never once wrote down an order. Everything with spot on. The Sea Dragon Roll was phenomenal and the veggie fried rice was superb! 

It's a bit on the expensive side, but it's Las Vegas so it's to be expected."}
{"text":"Ok sushi! But a great calamari app! Sushi was nothing special. Ordered Vegas & spider rolls. Nothing memorible about them."}
{"text":"The place has gone downhill in recent years the fried rice is not good the pad thai is average at best the Vietnamese spring rolls were okay sushi roll that I ordered was one of the exotic ones the only good thing on it was the tuna on top... the shrimp tempura in the middle was ice cold waste of $90 for two people. All shrimps now cheap quality taste like plastic."}
{"text":"We grabbed a quick dinner here before going to see Ka.  At first, we were concerned about how long it would take because it took forever to get our drinks.  The service was definitely mediocre and it annoyed me that the managers would only observe the servers.  They did not come over and ask for our drink order when they saw our impatience growing.  Instead, they tracked down a server for us.  Kind of annoying.  

For the extensive menu selection and variety of different cuisines, I was surprised at how good it was.  I mean, it was not divine, but good enough for a quick meal.  I had the Pho, which was average.  My Mom ordered a bunch of appetizers, including potstickers, spring rolls and lettuce wraps.  They were all quite good.  All in all, I would say this is a good spot to grab a quick meal if you happen to be at the MGM."}
{"text":"So first they don't inform us of the weekend price hike on the menu, then the portions are small for the $20 price tag for most entrees. Not worth it especially if you have kids with you. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Wonderful casual Chinese comfort food without leaving the strip!  Wish they opened late, for  Grand Wok's noodles is a perfect end to a full and fun day!  

This first visit, I was craving for wonton noodles and there it is on the menu!  When served, there was a whole big shrimp wrapped in each wonton, the Chinese broccoli were perfectly blanched, the broth was tasty and, the noodles were well cooked!  Ahhh - totally satisfied!  

Will be back!  

Cheers!

ps their Singapore fried rice noodles was delicious also - not skimping on ingredients - oh yea"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great meal at The Grand Wok & Sushi Bar while staying at the MGM Grand.  Our server Annie was awesome!  To enjoy a great vegan meal, we had the pad thai w/o fish sauce and egg, avocado sushi rolls and per Annie's suggestion, a great spicy fried tofu dish.  Excellent food and wonderful service.  Would go back again for the exact same meal!"}
{"text":"It is a great restaurant. 

I'm a Chinese. I have been search an authentic Chinese food restaurant for so long in Las Vegas, and all the Asian restaurant disappointed me (including really expensive one). I draw my wish on this restaurant at last since I saw the reviews and stars are really low. However, the result seems pretty good! I have waited about 15 minutes to get in the restaurant and the food arrives within 20 mins. 

The foods taste really close to Chinese style ( I only ordered Chinese food). The waiter have excellent attitude. 

I believe it deserves a 5 stars. 

I don't know why there are so many reviews that gives this restaurant a one star or two l. But I believe it is way better than 3 stars."}
{"text":"About what you'd pay for sushi at most big cities across the map; 15 sushi rolls to choose from & then an even bigger selection of your normal Asian fusion fare. We only got sushi but the meals served all around us really looked good.  Best sushi roll for us was the Dragon roll with BBQ eel...completely and unexpectedly amazing.  The Crunchy roll was also excellent.  Drinks were of course your $10 minimum so we only got two.  Total bill for two drinks, 3 sushi rolls and a cucumber salad to start (also very good) was about $40 a person. Again, decent price for Vegas compared to all the either super pricey places to eat at.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Such a nice place everybody's Chinese but I don't believe in at $24 bowl of pho... also if they going to charge $3 for rice if it's this dry, I'm choking."}
{"text":"This is a terrific place for sushi in Vegas. The service was great, the martinis were yummy. No complaints from me. There is also a cute garden out in front, and the atmosphere is very cool. I'd definitely go again when I get back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Bland food. Slow service.  You sit too close to others in the restaurant. The sushi was good, but that's the only bright spot about my experience. You do not get what you pay for here.  Go somewhere else for top bang for your Buck!"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place! Little pricey, but very satisfactor. Has many soft drinks and a few juices (even carrot juice!)
Very good miso soup. Great scenery, and its in a casino so you can gamble after a nice meal. Bamboo and some other plants growing too. An amazing private room with walls made of layers of smooth rocks and glass. Serves a good selection of beer, wine, and sake (rice wine)."}
{"text":"I wasn't so keen on trying this place, as sushi seems to be everywhereee, but parents decided to press on and try it. 

There was a wait, even at 8:30/9 pm, a mere hour before closing time! We had to wait about 20-30 minutes D:  But, good thing - they give you a buzzer that allows at least, for you (those over 21) to go sit at a nearby slot machine while you wait. 

It was busy, and our waitress was so rarely seen. We had to constantly keep an eye out for her, because she was MIA a lot. 

This restaurant is posh, and nice. Dark interior, with bamboo pillars. I liked it! It was a nice atmosphere for a reasonably-priced-for-vegas restaurant. 

We got the hainam chicken with rice, a shrimp tempura roll, a spicy cali roll, and tuna shashimi. Damn, that was expensive! $13 for two pieces of raw tuna on rice !! Wow. My dad didn't like it much, but then again, he is spoiled ;P 

The rice for the chicken was soggy, which was weird. There were all kinds of sauces on the side, which were all yummy. It also came with a small bowl of some sort of broth that was tasty. 

Our sushi rolls were about $11-13 each but they came in at least 6 - 8 pieces. They were delicious! I'm very picky with sushi, but these were, without a doubt, perfect! The rice had a great texture, and they were very flavorful. 

We did have to order more food, though, as it wasn't enough. We got the wok fried noodles with udon and XO sauce. It had a kick to it with its spice, and the udon noodles gave it a tweak to normal wok fried noodles. It was deliciously unique, having firm yet still soft udon noodles! They had lots of bite to it. 

Overall, yummy! It's a bit pricey, but what can you expect from a restaurant inside a casino? If you want cheaper(ish) asian food, go to spring mountain road in chinatown (it's not that far!).

However, this place is worth it. Definitely coming again when I'm in Vegas, and craving sushi."}
{"text":"My wife really enjoyed the beef noodle soup. I ordered the wok fried noodle with chicken though I must say that after we left the restaurant I had to get a salad as I was still hungry."}
{"text":"Not really busy but you wait!!!

Wait for waterless to come, wait even longer to make order.   Then you wait... For the order you made 30 min.  age --- she place WRONG order!

So I got a not-too-hot noodle soup to eat along and my boy friend to get his re-order 15 minutes LATER!!!

So we wait, another 15 minutes of our life time for the bill...  

Uhaaaaa...."}
{"text":"Very Pricey and the food was horrible. My boyfriend ordered the fish and it was under cooked and had bones in it. The service was very slow and their weren't even any customers in there.  I won't be returning or recommending to anyone."}
{"text":"It's too bad people have given this place poor reviews based mostly on price. I mean, have you been to Vegas before?? Everything is more expensive than other places!

That said, I was really impressed with the quality of the sushi here and found the prices to be totally reasonable by Vegas standards.

We showed up at 7:30pm on a Tuesday night and the wait was 25 min (they don't take reservations.) That was actually a much better wait than other restaurants at the MGM. Fortunately they take your number and text you when your table is ready, so we were able to go get a drink at the whiskey bar while we waited. 

Food was all amazing! We got the Salt and Pepper calamari (perfectly spicy) the Negihama roll (simple and perfect) the Aloha roll (awesome!) and some salmon sushi (perfectly fresh)

Service was fast and super friendly. I cannot recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"I almost gave a 5 star on this one, but I like to reserve those for things that blow my socks off. This was very, very good, though. I had miso soup and the aloha roll, and my SO had the dragon roll (or some name like that), and all of the food was great. The guy next to me had a wonton soup that made my mouth water even though I was full. The service was appropriately attentive without hovering. I'd go back with very little prompting."}
{"text":"I'm always nervous to try a new sushi place, but I must say, I was pleasantly surprised with this one. I ordered a hot noodle dish which was delicious, as was our sushi appetizer. It does get crowded and noisy, but food came out within 10 min of ordering. Waitress was very helpful in choosing a delicious light sake from their extensive sake menu.  Would return again, good food for the $."}
{"text":"It is located inside MGM. One of my friend took me out to dinner here. I like the decor of this restaurant. However, the food was just ok. Prices are just what you'd expect at the Strip; i.e. pretty expensive for what you get. The food is a mixture of Chinese, Singapore, Japanese, Korean, Thai, and Vietnamese cuisines."}
{"text":"This place was delicious!!!! We had the Sea Bass and veggie fried rice. The Sea Bass was one of the best I have ever had!!! It was mouth watering. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We wanted some Asian fusion while we were at the MGM and we remembered that we had a good meal here the last time we came. However this time things were different. Things have changed. We ordered the Orange chicken and the food was pretty good. The service however was horrible. The waitress brought out the wrong sushi roll. We almost finished eating and when we inquired about the sushi roll at the end of our meal they finally brought it out. The roll was not fresh either. The extra rice came at the end of our meal as well."}
{"text":"The place looks nice and the waiters are friendly. However the ambiance is absent. There's no ambiance. Feels like sitting in some cheap diner with people talking loudly, utensils and kitchen making noise and no music whatsoever. 
As to the food - below average, for the price of your fanciest restaurant in town. Sashimi/Nigiri - two pieces for $10. The waitress said \"if you're hungry you should probably order 6 of those\". 
The sashimi was mediocre (very reminiscent of the ones I buy at Safeway when everything is closed) and the Ramen was just a basic miso soup with the addition of cup noodles."}
{"text":"Easily, among the worst sushi I've ever had at a restaurant. Sushi was dry and bland. The Mongolian Beef was decent, but nothing to write home about. I expect to pay a little more at the big name Vegas casinos, but  I also expect the food to be pretty good and The Grand Wok didn't make the cut for me. The waiter was attentive, friendly, and probably the only thing keeping me from giving this place one star. Overall, if your total bill is going to be $80 for a relativity  small lunch and two beers, your going to have to do better than that."}
{"text":"Always a good meal. Nice sized portions too.
Favorites: Wonton soup,  Combination Fried rice,  Mangolian Beef,  Crispy noodles, Shrimp Pad Thai.  The Thai Tea is delicious too! 
The staff are all very gracious and accommodating with special requests."}
{"text":"this place is pretty pricey. sushi and miso soup are the best!!! yumm yumm yummm. my bf and i totally stuff'd ourselves with bomb a$$ sushi and was too full to eat the lo mein and pad thai.. we took the lo mein and pad thai back to our room...and  after a night of gambling and all the free drinks we got from the casino floor at mgm.. we had the noodles for left over and it was still yummyyy!!"}
{"text":"I got the Beef Ramen to go. 
The wait wasn't too long and the restaurant did seem too packed for a Sunday morning. But the ramen was really bland. I didn't really like much about it other than it was hot and I was in need of some comforting soup. 
It was however, definitely pricey; I believe my total for my to-go ramen was $18.
WTH? I was completely disappointed with the lack of quality since the rolls that they were making while I was waiting for my food, looked SO GOOD! Maybe I should have ordered a roll instead. 

The restaurant however is roomy and clean. It would be unfair to rate them one star since the only thing I tried was the ramen. But I wasn't too impressed in their service either."}
{"text":"During a busy conference night at the hotel with no reservations we were able to walk right in and get a table. Our small group decided to share Sushi. 

The Sashimi was fresh (Yellowtail, tuna & salmon) but not very original in presentation or added flavors/sauces. 

We ordered a bunch of various rolls and all were solid and good to eat, but the trend with this restaurant was everything seemed very safe. As if we had eaten these dishes before at other restaurants. 

So if you are in the MGM with no reservations and you want a safe quality meal - you can't go wrong with The Grand Wok Sushi."}
{"text":"The shrimp here especially in the pad Thai is to die for. The sushi was not bad at all and everyone looked to be OKAY with their food. Nothing amazing here just mediocre. I think the shrimp and sushi are the reasons I would come back except the sushi is a bit much but that's to be expected since this is off the strip and it's Vegas so not surprised that things are totally over priced.  

Now the service on the other hand was terribly poor. The waitress that helped us to say the least barely came to check on our table so I have no idea if she was swerving too large of an are or if it was just understaffed. But who knows she could have just been slow as hell since she was a bit older. 

Do I see myself coming back to this location when I go to vegas again? I highly doubt it. Unless I am lazy and can't think of anywhere else to go."}
{"text":"After being glued to the blackjack table for 6 hours, my friend and I decided that we needed to fuel our system before we continued on our money making spree.

We couldn't really decide what we wanted yet so we were asking the waitress questions. We were going to share and so I asked the waitress how big the serving for fried rice is. She said it's a serving for 1 person only and did the a small bowl sign.

We ended up ordering a fried rice, a noodle soup and a roll.

First off, the fried rice was not a serving size, it could have served 3 or more people. Second, the roll said it had tempura which was nowhere to be found. An ant would not even be able to find it.
Third, the food was just watevers. I've worked in many sushi restaurants and to pay triple the price for something that doesn't even taste half as good is pretty saddening. Never coming back here again.

Lastly, the waitress didn't even check on us once. It seemed like she doesn't know her portions very well. I am a waitress myself so I would understand if it was busy but seriously... Crickets....

Just a warning, expect to pay a lot for something that's not very good!!"}
{"text":"The tom yum noodles soup, sushi rolls, and stirred fry noodles here are excellent. Great service."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place!  We walked up and got a table of 8 in. With no wait when the place down the way has told us and hour wait with a 1/3 empty restaurant.  Waiter staff was effective, food choices nice and flavors delish.  We were comfortable, enjoyed time chatting and beverage selection was good.  Thanks!  Will stop in again"}
{"text":"How should I feel about pre-sliced sushi???
Probably the same as if you walk into a bar and they give you a pre-poured draft beer!!!
Sat at sushi bar watching sushi \"chef\" ( term used loosely) plonk fish on rice - done!  I COULD DO THAT!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband went here for dinner and they were pretty busy. We waited 5 mins until we got seated. Looks like they packed all the time. We ordered pot stickers for appetiZer,l (pork) and they were so good!!! You guys must try it. We also got cantonese roast duck which is really good just a lil bit salty for me, and we had fried shrimp garlic rice. I will definitely come back here again for sushi!"}
{"text":"Wait staff is very helpful, if a bit impatient.  They know their game, however, and serve some very satisfying sake and sushi fare.   The chefs have skill and aren't afraid of a little challenge."}
{"text":"While in Vegas, my husband wanted Asian food and we found this place on Yelp. I followed a recommendation for the Salt and Pepper Calamari and was not disappointed. It was perfect. We also tried the Thai Iced Tea, mostly because we needed to give our livers a break and it was different but really good. I will warn that you can share a meal. My husband ordered the Orange Chicken and I got the Wok Fried Pork with Udon Noodles. Both were amazing but we were full half way through. Definitely recommend stopping here during a stay in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I would have rather eaten at Panda Express. My food was some of the most bland, uninspired food I have eaten in a long time. My won ton soup was too salty for my liking and the sushi was falling apart. I wasn't all that impressed with my fella's barbecue combination dish, but it was better than mine. And, being that the restaurant is in a casino, everything was of course overpriced. The service was the only thing that saved this place from getting one star. 

Save your money and find some cheap hole in the wall Chinese restaurant off the strip."}
{"text":"We arrived at 1130 pm on a Sunday night and were seated immediately.

 We had an entire section to ourselves, which was really cool as it was set up bigger then the main floor and encased in glass . 

We started off with hot sake, chicken lettuce wraps, and a few sushi rolls.

We also ordered Bbq pork, steamed rice and Kung pow chicken. 

The Saki was warm, not hot which was unfortunate. It made it a bit hard to choke down.

The sushi was ok. I think we are spoiled living in Vancouver, however it was fresh and tasty. 

The chicken wraps were good, as was the kung pow chicken. Sadly the Bbq pork was not crispy like I was hoping it would be.

They were closing so we didn't want to over stay our welcome. 

I would say it's a solid 3.5. Nothing overerally bad but nothing super memorable. I doubt I would return as there are way more places to check out in Vegas."}
{"text":"So impressed with this restaurant! The customer service was 5 stars and the food was excellent. They were extremely fast and were able to answer all of our questions. Gluten free is clearly labelled and they even have gluten free soy sauce. The price is fair for a Vegas hotel, I will definitely be coming back. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I am attracted to chinese joints in casinos that are geared to the asian gamblers.  I've stayed here for years and always thought this place was part of the Grand Lux Cafe.  I don't know whether it is my ethnic loyalty or cultural confusion that makes me want to eat something asian when I am in Vegas, but it sure beats the hell out of a burger and fries.  1 star for having salty fish fried rice.

Conceptually, it's weird to have a sushi joint w/ soup noodles.  I tried both and was satisfied.  Once we found this place, we ate here whenever we wanted to grab a quick bite.  I gulp when I see Pho for $16, but it's Vegas...  In review, great service. It's fast.  It's good.  It's damn expensive.  

One complaint ~ Where is the keno lady?"}
{"text":"Dined here during a work trip with colleagues..we were so pleasantly surprised by the fresh food, great cocktail menus, and friendly service!  The items are all a la carte.  If you order a Chinese entree the rice is extra it doesn't come with it like most places offer, and other items you'd typically get as a combo are all sold separately.  The quality of the food is good though where you don't feel slighted at all by the prices."}
{"text":"This was the 1st place to grab a bite when we got to Vegas.  We were planning a big dinner so just wanted a snack.  That's certainly what we got - not very large sushi rolls for $17.50 but at least we didn't overeat.  

This is the problem I have....the sushi chefs were making different size sushi.  Eating at the bar, we observed the same seadragon roll that we ordered in a much larger size!  (fatter more fillings)  The roll was tasty but the real disappointment was the soft shell crab. It was burned and cold - probably had been prepared several hours earlier.  Have had much better in the burbs of San Diego.  Drinks are overpriced, but that's the norm at the casinos on the strip.  Service was really poor.  Compare this to the new Sea at Bally's and you are definitely better off at Sea."}
{"text":"They charge for everything, we asked for extra lettuce pieces for our lettuce wraps and they charged us $1.00 for 4 little lettuce. It's not the price it's the principal! Come on! 

We ordered a couple entree from the menu, heads up they don't come with rice, not even Kung pow chicken or sweet and sour chicken. $3.00 extra if you want a small bowl of rice. Ridiculous, our bill was way more than Fiamma which was way nicer restaurant and the food quality was much better than this place. 

The next time I'm staying at MGM I'll dine somewhere else. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Decent but inconsistent. I have been here a few times and some dishes are good and some not so much.  Of course it is over-priced but it's vegas.

We had the lychee martini and it was way too strong and had to get ice to drink it.  The pepper beef was VERY spicy and very tasty.

Sushi was good too.  Not a bad place if you want something fairly quick but not fast food and you don't want to spend $100 per person."}
{"text":"Not too bad, but not exceptional. My wife had the shrimp dumplings and I had the potstickers. Pretty good for small plates. I had a couple rolls that were described as tempura battered, but neither were. Both had tempura shrimp which was tough and dry. The other fish quality was good. My wife had the sashimi and seaweed salad, which she said was very fresh and tasty. I would think a place that specializes in sushi would have decent rolls, but I was disappointed. It helped that we had a $50 food voucher from the hotel, otherwise I would have been more bummed. There are probably plenty of other, better Japanese places in LV."}
{"text":"This sushi was equivalent to grocery store sushi. The service was good, especially considering they were slammed, but the sushi was not good. Cold dry rice and the fish didn't taste fresh. We only ordered two rolls and one Diet Coke, and our bill was about $50, with tip."}
{"text":"Trying to find decent priced food in Vegas on the strip, is not easy. The grand wok however, happily satisfied our cravings and our budget this weekend. We ordered pad thai, and two different sushi rolls, split between two people and still had left overs, so sharing is perfect and wont break the bank either! I give it 3 stars, because the service was just okay, we had to track our waiter down a few times, because I didnt have a napkin, we needed water... normal stuff. The food however is worth stopping by."}
{"text":"We had just finished some golf and a sushi lunch was on the line.  We had the calamari, garlic shrimp fried rice and pork bao which were all good.  The sushi was average: salmon, yellowtail and tuna all lacked flavor and freshness.  I would not get the sushi but the chinese food was good.      With a couple of bottles of sake it turned out to be quite the pricey meal."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Good service. Ordered the curry noodles, very delicious. Nice portion sizes. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"jOined yelp just because of this fckn restaurant...usually i'm not hard to disappoint coz i feel like every place should all be given a chance; well, this place SUCKS!!! my cousin visited me from NJ and i was looking for a place to take her to dinner; so i went on yelp for some suggestions...there was some bad reviews about this place, but i still tried it anyway...i should have listen! argh im so fckn mad!!! wtf was i thinkin?! everything was like $15-$25 for a little bit of food...i'm never one to complain but damn, MGM shouldn't even let that place be in there...im more pissed than disappointed. save your money people, go to I Love Sushi or Sushimon in Henderson, tastes so much better for the1/3 of price.

pros: 
*the furniture was nice
*waiter was nice

cons:
*curry chicken didn't even taste like curry & it was so salty
*too expensive for little portion of food
*the appetizer was a joke!
*my red dragon sushi roll was soggy"}
{"text":"I recently stayed at MGM for 4 nights. I think I ate here about 10 times during my stay.

The staff is very friendly from the first to last visit 

Casual atmosphere

I enjoy sitting at the sushi bar and watching the kitchen staff work from there open kitchen setup. Watching all the dishes come out first hand 

The pricing is a bit steep but it's expected being in a top tier casino"}
{"text":"Ten in the morning, feeling crappy from the night before, went here for a quick brunch. Wasn't feeling too hungry so I ordered just a sashimi platter (I heart salmon) while my friends ordered their way more complicated to make asian cuisine entrees. Half an hour later, everyone else was done eating and there I was cursing the heavens for my ill fate. Not really, but I was a somewhat pissed. I mean, really, how hard is it to slice up some freakin salmon, right? I know for sure doesn't take half a freakin hour. Bah, so I called the waiter and had my order cancelled - he did apologize - then gave me a bowl of miso soup with rice. WTF. I thought that was pretty insulting so I got a little more pissed - who the hell eats rice with miso soup? I know I don't. Asked for our bill, two minutes later - guess what? Here comes the waiter with my freakin order - that I clearly asked to be freakin cancelled. AND I was gettin billed for it! Now at this time I just really honestly wanted to cuss him out but thankfully for him, I'm not that kind of person. Kept my cool instead. Then when I reminded him I had it cancelled - mf had the nerve to have an annoyed look in his face. I was about ready to explode but decided to just get up and leave. F*&(*@~!!!!

I'd give it just one star but I went back the next day because again, we just wanted something quick, ordered some kind of noodle entree - that turned out okay, good portion - but I guess just right for what you're paying.

Probably won't go back here though, mediocre food and bad service just really isn't my thing."}
{"text":"from the reviews people can be lead away but ignore those reviews that make you think no and GO! we were greeted promptly by both hostess and server, our sushi come out within a reasonable amount of time, it was absolutely fabulous. the prices are fair for the food , its great simply go!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

After splurging all over Vegas. Our wallets needed a little break. Thank goodness for the food credit that accompanied our reservation. The credit only applied to certain restaurants. I am happy to say my family favorite was on the list...The Grand Wok.  Woo hoo. 

Through the years my taste buds have evolved and has learned to appreciate food even more.  For over 15 years now, I can honestly say GW has been CONSISTENT day in and day out. Save yourself some time and money and stick to these two MUST HAVES: 

SHRIMP & PORK WONTON NOODLE ($16)
--Savory and clean light broth with thin egg noodles cooked to JUST the right consistency.  Al dente egg noodles had the perfect bite!  
--Wontons were filled with big shrimp pieces and ground pork. You get at least 6 pieces.  
--Chinese broccoli and black mushrooms to enhance the flavors.  DELICIOUS. 
--Big portion.  Enough to share for 2.  

HONG KONG STYLE PAN FRIED CRISPY NOODLES: 
--crispy thin egg noodles topped with seafood, vegetables and a gravy like sauce. 
--I don't see it on the menu anymore, but I believe you can still order it.  

My most recent visit I deviated from my norm and went for something lighter. 

-Chicken lettuce cups ($13): decent, but nothing to talk about
-Rainbow Roll ($17): I usually question how fresh sushi in the middle of the desert can be.  Can you say, stomach ache?   Enough said!! 
SERVICE: A bit slow and understaffed. But friendly and polite. Lady apologized for the slow service, but did not make excuses or put blame on anyone.  Very commendable of her!

TID BITS: 
--Over priced Asian food. What do you expect, it's Vegas. 
-MSG rating: 1/5
-Kid and family friendly
-They thrive on classic Chinese dishes....stick to those!

Hoping Grand Wok sticks around for many more decades to come."}
{"text":"What a fabulous Asian cuisine restaurant. The pristine decor, the professional staff, and the plates that are stunning in presentation and taste make this a must-stop for any trip to Las Vegas. Even the most discriminating of foodies should find plenty to rave about in this jewel."}
{"text":"Wish I lived near this, damn.  This place was located inside of our hotel so super convenient and delicious. We got seated quickly. Very close and open seating area.  Had clear soul and a ginger salad both were what you would always expect.  Ordered the Las Vegas doll which was out this world, cooked to perfect. When I'm back in town it's on."}
{"text":"Everyone in my party enjoyed their meal's.  Sushi and traditional chinese fare was had.  However, the price is just too steep.  $19 for Beef Lo Mein?! Really?! No thanks, not again."}
{"text":"The summer rolls were average the vegetable dumplings were incredible.  The braised eggplant was very good and the chicken lo mein was extremely tasteless. We ordered the three sorbet trio  the coconut was incredible the raspberry was very good and the pineapple was disappointing. it was like a solid ball ice"}
{"text":"Craving sushi and stopped by this gem in the MGM hotel. This is a sushi and Chinese restaurant. They have a traditional sushi menu, as well as a Chinese food menu. Don't be surprised by the prices.. you're on the strip, you're in a nice hotel. Our food was so good! We ordered the calamari which has a nice lil kick to it. The fish they used for the rolls was so fresh and melted in your mouth. Our server was very nice and service was quick. Definitely more of a tourist spot due to the location of the restaurant, but if I'm ever back in the hotel and am craving sushi, I'll know where to go now!"}
{"text":"This place looks so nice and menu looks exciting but when you get your food it's very disappointing it does not taste that great, sushi was falling apart and for the price it's not worth it at all, we ordered beef and broccoli and we didn't know it does NOT come with rice, our server didn't tell us that or asked if we wanted rice, when we got the food I said where is the rice? She said ohhh it doesn't come with rice you have to order separately and for a small bowl of rice it was $8. This is a ripped off! Stay away from this place it doesn't taste good and so pricey for nothing!!"}
{"text":"I should say 1 for service and 4 for food. Waitress was practically running around yet managed to avoid us for 10 minutes even though we were the biggest party in the room. Slow to take our order, even our drink order then she missed my fiance completely in taking his order. We wanted to share an appetizer but all she cared about was having our bill be together. After her taking care of a table full of women, I had to track her down so my fiance could even order food. Food came out fairly quickly for 9 people. Food was delicious but I agree that the calamari texture was more like rubber. Sushi was amazing. When it came time to pay, she handed out the bills quickly but took forever to pick them back up and to top it all off she forgot to pick up 2 bills for people in our group. Service sucks, food is great. So, I guess this is a \"Pick your battle\" place."}
{"text":"I never eat at restaurants where they serve both Japanese and Chinese food on the menu. Everyone knows that.

However, my friends and I were gambling at the MGM, but we were starving after playing cards and didn't want to trek to another casino or eat anything fancy on a regular weeknight of gambling. 

We were the only Asians inside eating here. 

UH OH. NOT GOOD."}
{"text":"We came on a very very slow Tuesday night. There was only a few of us dining. For people complaining about the price, there's always McDonald's chipotle and Denny's on the strip if you wanted something cheaper. Yes, it is on the pricey said compared to what your used to back home, but you're on Vegas. On the strip to be exact. 

I ordered their dragon roll and felt it was reasonably priced. It was very tasty and plated beautifully. Wasn't really craving anything else. The waiter was really kind and always smiling when she came and checked up on us. I'm not entirely sure if I would return as there's so many other options available."}
{"text":"This was a great place to stop and eat dinner. We stopped here on a Saturday night, busy but not busy enough for a wait last which is great! The restaurant itself isn't that big which gave it a much more intimate feel. There was also a little room in the middle for reserved tables or VIPs? 

The servers and hostess were all really nice and very attentive to our needs. The decor inside was really nice and clean. The menu wasn't too big but that is because the portions are big and pricey. They took our orders and drink orders. Our appetizers came out before our drinks which was weird. The appetizers were really good. Once our drinks came out , the order of green tea also came out - which was yummy! 

As far as the food, large portions again, but so very good. If you are coming in with a group, make sure you order a little bit of everything as there will be plenty to go around. Pineapple chicken was really yummy and the rice was also really good. 

NOTE: if you are allergic to seafood make sure to review menu details, some dinners have stuff made out of oyster sauce, fish or shrimp - so be careful!"}
{"text":"Definitely an upgrade from PF Changs! I had the orange chicken in some sherry sauce and it was fabulous. The wife had the Nasi Goreng and said it was better than at several Indonesian restaurants we've tried. I ordered a Tsing Tao beer and got a $12 giant size one that I couldn't finish. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Where can you get 20 dolla porridge and wish you were eating all you can eat king crab at Caesars??  

here.  :(  

what was I thinking?"}
{"text":"We passed by here so many times, but were intimidated to go in here expecting small portions and jacked up prices as with most restaurants in Vegas have.  But a group of us were starving and were running late for our flight out and needed to grab dinner real quick.  So Grand Wok it was.

Decor is nice and very clean.  

Turns out the portion sizes were generous.  The sushi was yummy and fresh and they offered a lot of variety.  My friend ordered a malaysian noodle plate and it was piled up high and very flavorful.  

Service was great and very attentive.  The food came out pretty fast.

Next time we come back to Vegas, we'll definitely consider coming to Grand Wok again."}
{"text":"This is an expensive upscale restaurant. We came here because it was convenient but if we had a choice we would have eaten outside of the hotel.  

The entrees were above acceptable. 

The combo fried rice was not fried under high enough heat to give it a good fried rice taste and it was a bit too oily.  

The roasted BBQ duck and pork were bland and too fatty. 

The shrimp pad Thai noodle was a bit salty but not sweet, unlike traditional Thai dishes. 

The beef flat noodle was perfectly done. 

The spider roll was harder than normal. I believe the soft shell crab was deep fried too long. 

I am given this place three stars because it was clean, had a good ambience and comfortable seating. Otherwise I would have given this place a two star."}
{"text":"A cockroach, poor service and quality are ingredients to an out of business future. Pass on this."}
{"text":"Amazing place for a late night dinner. 

Ate here after the Ka show. Good service and they had a huge variety of foods. 

We ordered the fried rice, noodles, soups, a couple sushi rolls, and everything was amazing! Great portions and good for family style sharing. 

The wonton soup was my favorite!

Like many asian places in Vegas, it is a on the pricey side but I would say its worth it!"}
{"text":"Great service, but my pan fried sea bass had so much bone in it! The flavors were great but several bites had bones about 1 inch long - it detracted so much from the dish! The green beans in XO sauce were nice and crunchy, and the spicy salmon roll had some subtle heat."}
{"text":"Love this place. Just the right size portions. The Dragon sushi roll was good. Wait time for entrees was average 15-20 min. Recommend and I will be going back."}
{"text":"Dinned for lunch and had Spicy Tuna Roll and PadT chicken. Sushi roll was very good; fresh and tender. The PadT chicken was ok; very salty tasting and tough chicken. Service was prompt and friendly with a professional business like style."}
{"text":"The service and food quality will bring us back. Are the employees busy? YES-Prices a little steep? YES....you are at the Las Vegas Nevada MGM Grand Hotel on the Strip so  what do you expect.....order ahead take out is best and hit that fried Chilean sea bass"}
{"text":"Huge selection and excellent sushi. I highly recommend the garlic shrimp sashimi!  Well worth the price."}
{"text":"Pretty decent (really good) food- I tried a lot while I was there- the steamed Chilean sea bass, pork dumplings, cucumber salad, and the amazing calamari.  The service was very slow and pretty awful- it took us a long time to be greeted and then our server barely came around.  I tried to tell how busy it was because I felt bad for the server but daaaaang.  I haven't had that bad of service in a long time!  I don't know if I can go back because of that.  A manager never came by our table and no other servers ever offered to help our server if he was weeded...  Pretty cheap prices compared to other strip venues."}
{"text":"Service here is great and some items are really delicious...but I still think this is a pretty pricey joint for chinese food.  I would give it 3 stars for the value/price and some not so great menu items, but I'm giving it 4 stars because I ate here twice in 2 days and I always left happy.

The Dried Scallop and Duck \"E\" mein noodles are sooooo good.  It's a must try.  

DO NOT get the pork belly.  It is NOT worth $9.  You get two buns stuffed with flavorless bbq pork.

The Combination fried rice is really dry.

The Vegas roll is ok...The red bean soup for dessert is good."}
{"text":"We came here before our show started. Our group had 9 people. We sat at a round table with a lazy-susan in the center. The ambiance was nice, and it was fairly dark in here. 

We ordered edemame and spring rolls for appetizers. 6 different sushi, two pad-Thai with chicken, vegetable fried rice, orange chicken and sweet n sour chicken. After a short wait, our two appetizers were brought out. These were gone almost immediately, as there were so many of us. Then we sat and waited for a really long time. We waited nearly 30 minutes before we saw any more food. Then everything came slowly, starting with the sushi. A few minutes later, another dish would arrive, and a few minutes later...another. We finally had all of our food, and not very much time to eat it all. 

The sushi was really good, and was very nicely displayed. The pieces were quite large. The pad-Thai was fairly good, but not the best I have had. The chicken pieces though, they were large and tender. Very good. I also tried the sweet n sour chicken, which was loaded with pineapple pieces. I really liked this dish.

After asking the waitress for the check, as we needed to get to our show, she proceeded to continue filling up all 9 of our water glasses. That was so frustrating, as she did not realize our need to leave. 

Again, the ambiance was nice, and the food was decent. If you do have a lot of time to spend, this place is quite nice."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant located in MGM, beautifully decorated and quiet for where it's located. The service and food were fantastic. I love sushi and absolutely loved the plate presentation and fresh taste. The glass of wine I had was a bit pricey for how small it was and the food portions were small compared to the price of the meal. That is the only reason I gave 4 stars. Overall the place is beautiful and food so delicious!! I wish we had a restaurant like this is my hometown. I will definitely be going back the next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food was fine...not great.  Avoid the pad Thai as it was flavorless. Sweet and sour chicken was good. Sushi was fine. With all the other options in Vegas, I wouldn't need to return to this place."}
{"text":"This place is garbage. Don't waste your money on food that isn't even comparable to Pei Wei. The service wasn't great and the $17 side of broccoli was just boring broccoli."}
{"text":"Gotta give this one just two stars. I had the sushi and was pretty unimpressed. It was just passable. Ok, but nothing great. The tuna was SO not spicy, just somewhat bland and dry. And the salmon nigri didn't taste too fresh. In addition, the service was pretty unattentive and slow, and they put the check down before asking us if we needed anything else. I always feel like they want you out of there when they do that, but that's ok. I gladly left. And I won't be back. I was happier with Todai at the Puente Hills mall back in So. Cal."}
{"text":"Friend had orange  chicken and I had Kung pao shrimp, both quite tasty. Portions actually too big for a night out in Vegas. Usual Vegas prices- $28 for shrimp but cheaper than most restaurants around. Would go back & try the sushi. Looked good"}
{"text":"Although it says attire is casual its kinda not...or they're definition of casual differs slightly from mine... well maybe business casual, I looked it up... show up in a FU johnny cash shirt, shorts, and shoes with no socks and you might feel outta place. 
The place has an elegant feel to it, clean, collected. 
We were seated as soon as we got there and were attended to rather quickly. Service was great.  
The food was good also.  The rolls were nicely presented,  flavor was great, and fresh tasting.  Although i wasn't completely satisfied with the tuna.  The yellowtail and salmon were good.  The noodles were pretty solid.  flavor was on point,  didn't disappoint.
All in all i was happy with this place. Just remember,  wear socks."}
{"text":"hainanese chicken rice - pretty damn good. chicken was moist, good dipping sauces, the rice was flavorful, soup is good. $24

duck, shrimp rice rice - not bad, but $16 bucks for average fried rice?

food was good, but if you can get to spring mountain rd, you'll get three good asian meals for the price of one meal at grand wok."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the most expensive Asian fusion restaurant I have been to that serves mediocre food. For two people, our check was a hundred dollars after gratuity.  I don't remember how much each dish costs, but I know the broccoli with beef order was a whopping $23.00.

We ordered two bowls of hot n sour soup, a dragon sushi roll, a pork pad thai, a broccoli with beef, and a large beer.

The hot n sour soup was extremely salty. So salty that I had to dilute it with water. The dragon roll was okay. It's basically a regular California Roll with avocado and eel added to it. Nothing fancy,  and it's no big deal.  The pork pad thai was also okay. It had enough flavor in it, but the rice noodles was a bit too clumped together. The order was tiny, not enough to feed two people.  The broccoli with beef was probably the best tasting. The oyster sauce made it really good, and the broccoli was fresh. Yes, this order was also very small. And finally the beer was cold and refreshing. 

The service was not too good. We had to keep flagging down the waitress before she came. She probably had a bad day since she was on the grumpy side.

The restaurant is really nice. Very comfortable setting. I could have enjoyed my dinner more if we didn't have to sit in between obnoxious people.  Boy, they were loud the whole time.  

Since our dining choices are in abundance at Sin City,  I probably won't be back to this place.  A hundred bucks for a meal that is probably 30.00 elsewhere is not worthwhile for me. 

I should have gone to Panda Express. LOL."}
{"text":"This is one of the sushi places inside MGM. I actually thought sushi was just normal and prices a bit high. Prices are due to Vegas but the sushi was just middle of the road. I didn't have anything crazy, just a few basic rolls. 

I think it's a good place to grab some quick sushi if staying at MGM. Service is quick. Just a bit expensive and middle road."}
{"text":"With a damn near psychic? waitress, oolong tea with a simple and perfect aroma, and a meal that is balanced on flavor. This is a restaurant that you will never forget."}
{"text":"If you want good sushi YOU HAVE TO GO HERE! I ordered the aloha roll and my friend ordered their ramen. I didnt think the sushi would fill me up but the portions are large and two people could easily share if they are looking for a light meal. This is by far the best sushi I think iv ever had. I recommend the  ramen as well!"}
{"text":"Nothing like craving Sushi at 1am in vegas. The atmosphere is great. For that time of the day there were a few tables occupied, but wasn't loud. Wait staff was friendly and attentive. We had a spicy california roll, shushimi, and a spicy crab roll and dumplings. Also had some miso soup and tea to go with it."}
{"text":"Love the location and decor of this restaurant. However, the food was just alright; service was a bit slow (it wasn't busy at the time). Prices are just what you'd expect at a resort-casino; in other words, pretty expensive for what you get. Food's a cross of Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Korean, Singapore and Vietnamese cuisines.

We ordered 3 sushi rolls (nevada, aloha, & negihama) and a Singaporean rice dish for a quick lunch before we head home. Everything tasted decent... nothing special. If you're staying at MGM and happen to crave Asian food, this is probably the best choice you have. Otherwise, it's not worth a special trip out of your way to dine here."}
{"text":"In spite of the other reviews, we stopped here for lunch.  Bland king pao chicken, eel on the sushi tasted a little less than fresh.  I wouldn't do it again."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning here last week ... and the MGM has been less than helpful in recovering the costs of having to change my travel plans, etc.  I have never been so sick."}
{"text":"We've eaten at the Grand Wok about four times.  This last trip to Vegas we went for dinner.  We weren't impressed with our choices.  Don't order the Orange Chicken!    The Spicy Tuna Roll was good.   Service can definitely be improved.   The place is pretty pricey.  Stick to sushi dishes and you'll be ok."}
{"text":"Okay food.  The reason this didn't get lower rating cause of location and casual atompshere.  I think a good place to hang with friends for a quick dinner before heading out.  Sushi was okay...not the best tasting.  Little over price but what isn't on the Strip.  If you're staying at the MGM and need Asian food...better to go to PEARL."}
{"text":"Over priced beer. Second rate food. Beer came after my appetiZer and main dish were delivered = poor service. What's to like? I'd go hungry before eating here again."}
{"text":"Bachelorette Party!!! 6 Days in Vegas!!! 
Since I booked my flight one day Earlier (total accident) I booked a room at the MGM Grand. 

After serval flight delays! I finally arrived to the MGM! One of my girlfriends and I decided to stop by the Grand Wok during Happy Hour! Select Cocktails and Appetizers for $7.

Starter cocktails: 
Pink Lotus and Cherry Snow. Both DELISH!! 

Appetizers: 
Fried Pork Chops: Wow!!! This was my absolute favorite!!! Thin slices of pork--seasoned to perfection!!! This dish is even better over rice!!! 
Duck Lettuce Wraps: Amazing!!!

Entrees:
California Spicy Roll 
Futomaki Roll

Second visit!!
After all my girlfriends arrived, we came here again on Sunday. There were 5 of us. Our waitress was very RUDE! She got half out orders wrong! Rolling her eyes, huffing and puffing like a 2yr old child!! We asked for more rice several times, she kept forgetting---then continued with her disgusting attitude. Finally the manager came over and sorted everything out!"}
{"text":"My gf LOVES this place and insisted we go here for the Asian dishes. It actually was really good! Since we were staying at the MGM, we were super lazy to go anywhere for food, so just went downstairs and this place was here. She went here often with her family and said it was good, so we decided to go here! 

Like all restaurants in Vegas any Asian restaurant will price up their asian dishes. Since I am Asian, I know that these noodle dishes should be a lot cheaper, especially because it is so easy to make....BUT the quality is actually a lot better considering you're paying double the amount. 

We went with the: 

Dragon Roll: Yes this Asian place not only offers a bunch of noodle dishes, but sushi as well! The rolls were so thick! I like it like that and I love when the unagi pieces are thick too so you can actually taste the eel. The ingredients on this roll were so packed that it tastes so delish with the Teriyaki sauce. 

Beef Rice Noodle: Basically Beef Chow Fun. Yes it was oily, but it tastes so awesome! Loved the soy sauce flavor all over it and the fresh cut beef. 

Good place to eat at !"}
{"text":"I thought the rolls were delicious and amazingly fresh. The service was great and the prices were about a third as much as any restaurants at the hotel I was staying at so I can't complain!"}
{"text":"I'm from South Florida where we have a million good sushi restaurants, did not expect to have the best sushi of my life in a random place in the MGM.  Had the aloha roll, every bite was orgasmic.  Hands down the most flavorful roll I have ever eaten.  I am lost now as I don't know where to go to find an equally amazing roll.  GF had the rainbow roll, not usually something I order but it was just as spot on incredible.  Go here and eat sushi, was very moderately priced and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was great, and had miso soup, and some spider rolls. Everything was very tasty. If price is a concern you probably should look for an alternative off the strip"}
{"text":"Went to a business lunch here and it was good. Everyone seemed to order different things and we all finished our meals.  It's a little pricey for what you get but overall it was good.  The food tasted very clean and the service was just a little slow.  It seemed really clean and the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"In San Francisco, this restaurant may be rated 2 stars because of price vs quality... but we're in Vegas afterall - so it is cheaper than the other restaurants.  We actually went here twice.  The first time, we were craving Chinese food and this place just happened to be around the corner.  Surprisingly, the food was pretty good!  We had the Singaporean noodles and the Yee-Mien.  We also ordered sushi - which was excellent!  We also ordered the overpriced sake, but that was great too.  Portions were a little on the thin side... but just enough carbs to last us through the night.

After a crazy night in Vegas, we were looking for \"hangover\" food.  Anywhere that has noodle soup.  BINGO.  This place hit JUST the spot.  I had the beef noodle soup.  It was yummy.  My friend had the seafood soup.  Minus the MSG, it actually looks pretty healthy.  And that is why.... despite the overpriced Chinese food, this place for 4 stars!  It satisfied all our Chinese food cravings in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Dangerously expensive but OMG SO gooooood!  Their calamari is sweet and spicy and crunchy.  The sushi is just how you would want your sushi to taste and you get a good portion!  My boyfriend and I were staying the night in the hotel and stopped here for some sushi and spent like $80!!!  On two drinks, two orders of sushi, and a calamari appetizer.  So, it's a bit pricy but delicious if you're in Sin City and want to treat yourself to some good sushi."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate a light lunch here since we arrived before check in time @ the MGM Grand. We ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai noodles ($14.75) and Spicy Tuna roll ($8.95). The food was tasty but pricey for the quantity that you get. Good thing I wasn't too hungry or I would have ordered another roll to fill myself up.

All in all, it is a good place to go to if you are craving asian food and just wanted to stay in the vicinity of the hotel."}
{"text":"The low-ish reviews for this place are wrong in my opinion. We had Mongolian beef, sweet and sour chicken, shrimp pad Thai and rolls. Everything was excellent! The quality of the rolls and beef were outstanding!"}
{"text":"Grand Wok at MGM Grand serves Asian cuisine - diverse with Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese and Thai menu items. The food here is pretty average... Nothing incredibly exciting. 

- Chicken Pad Thai; A little on the dryer side. Chicken came out partially uncooked and the server was quick to bring out a new one
- Miso Ramen; Basically ramen noodles in miso soup. Comes with bok choy, bamboo, pork, and egg
- Pork Udon Noodles in XO Sauce; One of their tastier dishes, stir friend Lo-mein style with pieces of pork. I've subbed the pork for shrimp, costs a little extra
- Red Dragon Roll; The best roll on the menu. Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, with tempura flakes and eel sauce drizzled on top
- Cucumber Salad; Spicy, sour, and very refreshing! 

Service is excellent (no complaints), the food is meh, and a bit pricey for the quality and taste in my opinion. If you're wanting delicious Asian cuisine at MGM, go splurge at Shibuya!"}
{"text":"Service was quick.

Calamari was really good, but got salty towards the end.

But the Aloha & Sea dragon roll were amazing :D"}
{"text":"Over-priced mediocre chinese food! What do you expect for a restaurant in a hotel?

Drive across the freeway to chinatown and get 10X better chinese food for half the price! We ordered fried rice, beef soy-sauce noodles and green beans for about $20 each and each plate came out half full. Each dish was mediocre as well as they all lacked flavor, at least put some salt in it?"}
{"text":"Only place I could find for dinner that did not have a wait. Menu looked good. Calamari appetizer was delicious. I had the Las Vegas sushi roll, it was great. My boyfriend had the beef lo mein. We surprised at the small portion. High price for small amount of food and nothing special... but worth not waiting for a table? Yes. Service was also good."}
{"text":"Awesome gluten free sushi! We ate here a few times during our vacation in Las Vegas. They have gluten free soy sauce- Little Soya. I had never heard of this brand until this visit and I'm glad I was introduced to it. I also tried a gluten free noodle dish, it was tasty but I enjoyed the sushi more."}
{"text":"It saddens me to write this review.
Mostly because I use to LOVE this place.
Many of my best night in Vegas began here, no matter where on the strip I was staying I would go to MGM for sushi. 

However this last visit was a disappointment.
The staff was slow and seemed confused. 
They seated us with only one menu, which I still cannot figure out.
Many times my water glass was empty and I had to ask for a refill. 
Our food took over 45 minutes to come out, while other groups who were seated after us had already eaten and were signing their checks. 

Usually we get Orange chicken and sushi but this time we went for more Chinese food, big mistake. 

The portion of the Orange Chicken seemed to have been cut in half while the price increased, since July. The chicken was okay but it use to be better. The curry rice noodles were more bland than curry. The shrimp in with the rice noodles were not marinated and had no flavor.  

At least my favorite bottle of sake is still worth the money, however the price of that has almost doubled in the last year. 

All in all pretty disappointing meal for $100. 

I am not sure what happened to this place but it seems to have gone down hill at warp speed. Not sure if I will be eating here ever again."}
{"text":"Prices are exactly double of what they'd be at comparable restaurants off the Strip. If you can get over that, then Grand Wok is a convenient spot for Asian food at the MGM.

I was really craving Wonton Soup, so I shelled out $24 for a one person serving. The dish is on the large side and would also be a good option to share as an appetizer.

I took my soup to-go, and while the wontons and broth tasted great, it was actually missing the mushrooms and Chinese broccoli. For $24, I really wanted those veggies!

Is Grand Wok my first choice in MGM? No way. But if you're craving some Asian fusion that doesn't break the bank, it's your best bet without having to venture too far."}
{"text":"Me and my husband have eaten here three times before and it gets yummier every time. We love to share the Shrimp and Pork wonton noodle soup. It's huge so if you aren't sharing I doubt you can actually eat an entree.  

We've also enjoyed the calamari. I can't stop talking about this and wishing it were on the menu at every other restaurant that I visit. The slivers of red peppers make it over the top yummy. 

We like the Orange Chicken though I wish it were crispier.  They used long slices of breast meat so perhaps frying any longer would cause dryness issues. Request extra hot and spicy and your waitress will make sure it happens.

The manager has been there for years. I don't know what his name is, but we've seen him for a while. I always remember him and I have to remind my husband of moments when he's come by our table to see how our meal is. It's a nice touch. The waitresses are awesome too. I really like this place and even though we keep saying we will go to another hotel we either stay at the MGM or the Signature. I'm sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"I just finished my meal & have so many great things to say about this place. First, the Vietnamese Pho is out-of-this-world delicious. I also had sake and edamame that were perfect. On top of that, my server (Annie) was extremely kind, friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. She helped me decide on the pho and her description was perfect. She made sure my water was filled and that I was enjoying my experience. It's too bad I don't have another day to stay here. I would be back no question."}
{"text":"When my belly is empty and I have already eaten at Capos Italian steak house I go here on the next night. If you like PF changs version of Honey walnut shrimp then you have to try the Grand Woks version. Once you have you will prefer to drive all night to get to this place to eat some.
 I usually get:
Pot stickers followed by Honey shrimp and house combination fried rice.
The staff is great and I have suggested that they list the Honey walnut shrimp as one of their signature dishes on the MGM web site for places to eat but it hasn't happened just yet.
ENJOY
By the way what I just ordered usually runs about $70.00 so if you are a group of 4 then you might want to bring a credit card and be ready for the bill but I have eaten here many many times."}
{"text":"I stay at MGM often and usually end up here. I have never had a bad experience. Went last night, a Friday on a fight weekend and only had a 5 minute wait. Was seated and our server was very prompt getting our orders and the kitchen was fast. We are a Korean family and tried the kimchi and were very impressed with it (only wish kimchi was served with rice- order rice with it!) Also had several sushi rolls and they were delicious and fresh. Would highly recommend this place if you don't want to go to one of the more expensive sushi restaurants on the strip!"}
{"text":"What?!?! No black cloth napkins???

How can you serve a dinner only menu but not have black napkins for those of us who hide that extra pudginess everyone gets during vaca, by wearing black as a uniform.. Down to the black fishnets later at the Hard Rock - I jest!!! Everybody knows it's all about the CFM boots! But the caveat is that you have to find a babysitter for the kiddo beforehand - c'mon people catch up here. ;)

Anyways, aside from that - this place still gets 5 stars! Why? Because on our first night in town with the baby, we got a craving for Chinese food. 

Strolled down Restaurant Row, and here we are. Hmmmm, dressed up Asian Fusion, with a great selection of all regions of Asia (well, except for the Philippines.... I suppose we are PI after all). 

When looking in the windows, we saw a family with 4 little ones under the age of 7 - OK this is OUR place. Great food, doesn't mind the kiddo making a mess, and even folded up the stroller for us when we walked in. 

The design and layout of the regular restaurant was very nice. WE never really sit at the Sushi Bar, unless it's date night. Doesn't seem fair to let the kiddo take up a stool where somebody could order their fix of unagi and toro, etc.

Anyways - the quality of service - SUPERB. From the hostess, Host, Manager, and of course waitress. 

We ordered 3 rolls to split between us and they were so tasty! I'll post a picture, and edit with names. 

Best part - they serve ORION. Finally - a place that understands it's not always about Asahi or Sapporo, etc. 

The evening ended with the waitress talking to Rachael in Chinese and her actually cracking a smile at a stranger. Now that is the magic touch. :)

But I think the best part of the experience, is that we didn't truly realize or appreciate it until after we left, but the beautiful glass walls that make the restaurant front, also serve as noise proofing for the casino traffic right outside. Now that's classy ;)"}
{"text":"Grand Wok? Grand Bill more like it! Hey it's a Vegas hotel, so for convenience you will pay $30 for food court Chinese food, or $100 here for slightly better fare and not eat off paper plates. Don't go here to be wowed, but do expect to say \"wow\" when you get the bill!"}
{"text":"ZERO!!!
Came here at 9:40pm. The gal told me they were taking to go orders only but she they supposedly close at 10pm. Really? I wont be back. 
There's too many restaurants to choose from around here..."}
{"text":"I didn't order sushi so I can't speak for it. But the Chinese food is soooo good! We ordered beef noodle soup, ma po tofu and vegetable. All of then are excellent and the service was good as well."}
{"text":"In the MGM early to see the KA show, we wanted to get some Vegas sushi and stopped here.  Here's how we did....

We pulled in about 1 hour before the show started.  I told the server that we only had 40 minutes and that we were seeing the show.  She said no problem and that she'd put a rush order on the food.  I ordered 2 California hand rolls and the combo fried rice.  MDC ordered a salad.  The place was PACKED.  The hostess was nice, the servers were nice, shit...even the customers were nice.  This place had an amazing vibe.  About 5 minutes after we placed our order the hand rolls came out.  Now that's a rush order!  They were so tasty!  Less than 5 minutes?  That's rush service.  Less than 5 minutes after that the fried rice and the salad came out.  I loved the plates.  I forget what they looked like but I remember having a conversation about how much I liked them.  The fried rice had lobster, shrimp, chicken and even had some duck.  I love fried rice and this was superb.  MDC devoured her salad and even snuck a bite of my Cali-Cone.  Although we rushed, teh service was nice and food was good.  I loved my half hour here.

Will I again?  I would say yes but there are so many options that we will probably never be back.  Toots!"}
{"text":"Amazing service out waiter wad great but besides the service our food was five star top notch amazing I had the red dragon the sea dragon and the dragon rolls and they were some of the best sushi I have ever had in my life and that's saying slit because I am a sushi fanatic my boyfriend had the peppered beef with snow peas and the meat was so tender and juicy you almost didn't need to chew it... melt in your mouth doesn't even come close to how good it was

It is a must go to and we will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Yum.  We were looking for something a little different at MGM Grand.  Did not want a burgers and fries place, or a chain.  This looked nice from walking by.  The hostess was super nice.  The menu is impressive.  Esposa had chicken lo mein and I the Singapore-style curry noodles.  Both were very good (actually, mine was excellent--I win!).  The green tea was made from loose-leaf tea, not that nasty tea-bag stuff.  Portions were generous.  Prices reasonable.  Ambiance very nice."}
{"text":"I had the Tom Yum Noodle Soup with Shrimp.  It was so good!  Thin rice noodles like you would have in Vietnamese Pho, and the 3 shrimp were humongously large gigantic prawns.  My fiancé had the Mongolian Beef... It was amazing!  This place is fantastic!  We highly recommend this restaurant!  It will be a regular stop for us every time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"great vibe here!

Food: 4 stars
Service: 4 stars

Lychee martini to start off our night-- good choice! refreshing and strong martini, good amount of sweet.

We got some sashimi, a chicken lettuce wrap (so good) and a roll (alaskan?). Bf also got a miso soup. I didn't note down the prices since I wasn't the one paying :P but everything was well done. Chicken lettuce wrap had hot filling fresh off the wok and not too salty at all. Sashimi came in large, juicy and fresh pieces, I was definitely satisfied. The roll was mediocre but put together pretty well. Finished dinner with a mochi dessert. The fresh fruits were great, mochi ice cream was just ok. Overall, I say this is one of the best 'expensive-chinese' foods in vegas."}
{"text":"Typical for an Asian restaurant in Las Vegas, mediocre and expensive.

The pad thai was a little too greasy and not too much flavor in my opinion.  The Mandarin Beef Noodle Soup was not spicy at all and the beef was not that great."}
{"text":"The service is unbelievably slow and the food is way overpriced for mediocre food. 

Service: I sit down. Server asks what I'd like to drink, I say water and she quickly runs away even though I already know what I want to order. Water takes 15 minutes to arrive (delivered by a runner). Waitress takes another 10 minutes after water is delivered to come back to take my order even though the restaurant is more than half empty and I try to give her a visual que by closing my menu and placing it way on the other side of the table. Food takes an unbelievable 25 minutes to arrive and is disappointing (see below).

I ordered the Tom Yum Noodle Soup with Shrimp, which is a dish I've had in several Thai and asian fusion restaurants across the country. It's sort of the Thai version of pho. The broth barely had any taste in spite of the fact it's marked on the menu as spicy. And lacked the depth of flavor of citrus, lemongrass and chilis that Tom Yum normally has. Really it tasted like water downed chicken broth with a hint of lemongrass flavor. I had to ask for some chili paste to spice it up to an acceptable level. The shrimp tasted like it had been cooked separately and added as a garnish after the dish was plated. It hadn't even been salted and lacked any hint of taste.

For $14 I expected the Tom Yum to be at least as good as if not twice as good as the versions I've had in the past for $6-$7."}
{"text":"I'm super excited that I was able to find Grand Wok while staying at MGM Grande! After several days of American food, we were craving some soup of any kind so we decided to try it here since it was right in the hotel.  The restaurant is small but still have plenty of seating, so there wasn't much of a wait when we went for lunch.  It is a cutely decorated Asian restaurant and the workers were all very welcoming and friendly.

I ordered their shrimp pho and kimchi on their appetizer menu.  I was actually really surprised that they even had kimchi on their menu, but I was even more impressed on how the kimchi tasted. I think I'd go back to have their kimchi again when I'm in Las Vegas! It was marinated with classic Korean flavors and went excellent with my pho soup.  The shrimp pho was a good choice to go with! I was expecting small shrimp pieces in my pho soup, but it actually came with 3 HUGE prawns! The broth was flavorful and definitely hit my craving for soup while on vacation.  I'll definitely come back here whenever I stay at MGM or near by on the strip. 

Overall, excellent customer service and good food on vacation. What's not to like?!"}
{"text":"The food here was delicious. I'm a huge sushi fan and get it often and this place was good but not the best for sushi. My girlfriend and I split a roll and orange chicken and they were both good and filling together. I would recommend this restaurant of you're staying on the hotel. The prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight while on a vegas trip with the boyfriend and some friends. We wanted some sushi at somewhere that was reasonably affordable and could also use our MLife card so we came here.

It was a bit hard to find in the casino but we eventually got to it. It is beautifully decorated, clean, and has a nice relaxing ambiance. 

Our server was polite, prompt and eager to please. She made several suggestions for us and we were checked on by her and other employees there. Our drinks were always full so they earned points there.

We ordered miso soup and four sushi rolls (spicy tuna, las vegas, dragon roll and the aloha roll). The miso soup was delicious. It was fresh and full of flavor. The sushi rolls were just ok. I was hoping to walk away with an overall great experience but I just could not get into the rolls. I have had much worse sushi before, but I was hoping for a bit more for Las Vegas dining. Next time, I will take a friends suggestion and try some off-the-strip sushi locations."}
{"text":"I was super nervous to eat here because of the reviews with food poisoning but I am happy to say no one out my group of 10 got sick. 

We were told there would be a half hour wait but it ended up only being 10 minutes and we had a great table set up for us. Edamame and calamari were delicious. My husband and I split the Vegas roll and he ordered a dragon roll. Both were delicious! We also split an order of the chicken fried rice and it was very different than any fried rice I've had before, very clean tasting, not greasy at all! 

We enjoyed our dinner there and would recommend it for sure!"}
{"text":"Taking a break from the buffets and trying to shrink our stomachs back to normal, my husband and I decided to try the Grand Wok in MGM. It hit the spot! I got the Tom yum noodle soup ($19) that came with large tiger prawns, boy choy, mushrooms and noodles. It was labeled 'spicy' on the menu, but it was mildly hot. Which was perfect for me because I have a low spice tolerance. Broth was really good. 

Husband got the beef chow fun ($17), decent portion size and tasted authentic. Two thumbs up on taste! Go here for your Asian fix! Prices on the menu are about doubled then you would pay outside of the strip, but that's Vegas for ya!"}
{"text":"One of the best chinese food on Vegas strip! great quality! I never tried the Japanese dishes but I am sure they are just as good as the Chinese. Try this place and you will like it!"}
{"text":"One word to describe what this place made me feel: Happy. I felt happy draining out the bowl of miso soup they served me. Lots of fun stuff in it, and definitely very tasty. I wanted more. 

I was happy getting my plate of Red Dragon and Sea Dragon rolls. Crunchy, yummy goodness! I also tried their Las Vegas roll. I was on the edge of food coma. 

The hot tea was the bomb. It washed away all the uneasiness in my mouth and palate. It's a sushi joint that really got me hooked. 

My husband and I went back for more fusion, and we tried their combination fried rice as well as spicy orange chicken. Of course, we again had their hot tea. Great tasting, energy booster! Why is this place too far from home? I want more of it. 

Maybe, during my next trip to Vegas. 

P.S. Why less one star? Because it's too expensive. I need to win one of the slot machines first. Well, it's Vegas..."}
{"text":"OK, so I didn't die from food poison so that's a win, I'm putting 2 stars because the price was pretty insane for what you get. $12 for a california / salmon avocado role-- are you kidding me?!

Maybe the other fusion dishes are a better deal but I was dying for sushi and it was the closest place that was actually open.

Ok, so back to the price, I suppose that price is fair, we're in a desert.
Let's say I'm just to used to west coast pricing and sure, the fish is from extremely far away, that is NO excuse for $8 edamame! 

EIGHT DOLLARS. We're already helping them churn a profit on drinks, marking up edamame like that is insane, all one has to do for 'perfect edamame' is boil little pods or even microwave them in hot water! There is zero culinary skill required to make edamame. Sorry for the rant, it's actually quite funny. 

That is double the price of the most expensive, 5 star restaurant I've been to. Heck, in some places it's free. 

Then I went to the NY NY Hotel the next day, also expensive but during lunch hours you can get buy 2 get 1 free roles. Still high and a bit small but I was definitely satisfied after gorging myself on all of that. 

Pros that make it 2 stars:
Open all day
Wait staff was nice, if you like nice asian people they have that here
The ginger was just right

Other things to note: I'm from the pacific northwest / west coast, you probably can't beat that sushi but if you are too you should consider this review. If not, feel free to ignore it and check out the other ones."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Steve L in that the Mongolian beef I had was not what I usually get with Mongolian beef.  It WAS really good, though, so I can forgive them the fact that it isn't really Mongolian beef.  (Not even remotely spicy at all).  

My sister got the chicken with the noodles... I can't remember what that is called.  She liked it a lot.  I took a bite of chicken and did not enjoy it, but it wasn't my meal.  

It seemed rather reasonably priced to me, probably roughly what I would spend per person at a place like PF Changs, but for better food in my opinion.  

It is entirely possible I didn't notice, but I think they did not charge us for refills.  I also agree with Doreen B.  It is nice that the restaurant is really rather quiet despite facing into the casino.  I also liked that it is a no-smoking restaurant."}
{"text":"Well done for what it is-Japanese/Thai/Chinese-in a fairly modern setting.    Very nice server-can't recall the name-I'll add it in with an edit to this review if I find the receipt in my wallet, which looks like George Costanza's, (Seinfeld reference of course).

My wife enjoyed her shrimp pad thai and my bbq pork slices with rice was good.   I'd return any time."}
{"text":"So I am yelping this place because my boyfriend really wanted to read what I have to say about it.  Disclaimer: I've actually been here only once and this was almost a year ago on my last trip to Vegas so this review may not reflect the quality of the food right now.

Anyway, my boyfriend and I had stayed at the MGM and got a complimentary $25 dining coupon.  Of course, I went on Yelp to see which restaurant was even worth trying.  Since we used the coupon for lunch, our choices were limited and Grand Wok happened to be the only place that was open for lunch and had decent reviews.  More than a few people had recommended the Nasi Goreng (Indonesian Spiced Fried Rice with Chicken Satay) so of course we ordered that.  We also ordered a Spider Roll and the Rock and Roll.

The sushi rolls were really mediocre and definitely not worth the price they charge but whatever, it's Vegas.  The main star of our dining experience was the Nasi Goreng.  Even though people said it was good, I didn't expect too much from it.  But literally, my reaction when I first bit into the chicken skewer was \"OOOOHH MY GOD!\"  Yup, it was that damn good.  If I could base my rating of Grand Wok on this dish alone, I would give it 6 stars!  The next time we go back to Vegas, we're definitely gonna come here again.  My boyfriend can order whatever he wants but I'm gonna order one dish of Nasi Goreng just for myself ;)"}
{"text":"Over priced Asian food with ok service, it's Vegas. Small sushi rolls. Nice ambience and servers."}
{"text":"Happy to find a sushi bar that was not so pricey! Amy our waitress was very kind and friendly. Started with the Calamari which was very salty but I was starving so I dealt with it.   Ordered the Red Dragon roll. It was delicious. Our main course was the Kung Pao chicken which I did not like all. The chicken was rubbery and was drowning in sauce. Overall the roll was the best. 

If your craving sushi this is a good place to hit. The Chinese food is not worth the price."}
{"text":"The Grand Wok which is located inside the MGM casino & hotel is a pretty decent sushi restaurant. The sushi was fresh and tasteful. The overall service was on task but the friendliness did not seem to show from the staff. The price is good for what you're getting but I would suggest looking at other places if you're specifically wanting sushi. Overall I would try them again."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue, so I'm glad I took notes. 

My husband (who was only my boyfriend at the time) and I went here while we were in Las Vegas last December. I was in the mood for sushi and he wanted Chinese, so it was the perfect choice. 

I ordered the Spicy Tuna roll and the Crunchy roll. Both were good, but the Crunchy roll was better. My husband ordered the Orange Chicken and I was pleasantly surprised by it. I'm not one to order it as my entree, but I'm always willing to give it a try. Their version of this dish isn't breaded, which I love. It's flavorful and the serving was quite generous. I would recommend this dish here. As far as sushi is concerned, there are many other places you can go for better sushi."}
{"text":"Yes it's bloody expensive!  But... it's the casino and if you charge it to the room and lose enough money, the hotel will pick it up anyway.  Or... if the hotel doesn't, it means you didn't lose enough money which is a winning situation so what's 20 bucks for a plate of fried rice :D

We ate a lot here at our last trip to the MGM Grand - a couple weeks ago.  Why!?  'Coz it was one of the allocated restaurants in the mgm where they would pay for our meals (not the tip of course and we overlooked, the tax LOL).  Since we're not really buffet people and not about to stand in line for an hour to overeat instead of lose more money on electronic blackjack, we returned to the wok a lot.  I can safely say we've tried just about everything on their menu here lol.  It was sort of like eating buffet here for us - an order of nasi goreng, a noodle dish, a couple of rolls and some uni - welcome to Las Vegas :)  

Almost no complaints about the food.  The Chinese food is almost excellent!  So is the sushi - I bravely ordered uni since the husband convinced me that they might actually have as good an uni as Shibuya.  Guess what!?  They did!!  I guess they all order from the same distributors :)  The firecracker shrimp is YUMZ!   DO NOT order the Hainanese chicken rice if you know what it is.  You'd be highly disappointed.  But everything else I loved or liked a lot.  

Sammi Cheng had a concert while we were there so it was swamped with Asians more than usual.  They actually ran out of soy bean milk by day four  :(  I was so enjoying them too."}
{"text":"I might give The Grand Wok another shot, but this visit to the sushi bar was just ok.  We only ordered two very ordinary rolls and one bowl of soup, drank water, and got nicked for $38 with tip.  Charge it to the room, I say!"}
{"text":"Was walking around with my hubby aimlessly looking for a place to eat (preferably Japanese since we were in the mood) when we stumbled upon The Grand Wok.  We weren't quite sure if you had to make reservations or not so we made our way in...

Upon entering, we we're greeted by a hostess. I asked if there was a wait and gladly there wasn't (at the time) as we chose to sit at the bar.  We had an active view of the chefs preparing all the meals. We started lunch by both having shots of saki. Our meals were very tasty, yet looked very complex. I mean, I can't even explain what my food consisted of because it was so damn good. 

We all know that good food and drinks in Vegas comes at a price so don't expect this place to be cheap.  You should at least try this place once if you haven't done so. Overall, I liked the food as well as the service. We had a good experience there since our server was consistent and prompt."}
{"text":"Had dinner here and the service was really quick. Started with the lettuce cups and of course they don't give you enough lettuce, but it was very good. Moved onto the seafood noodle dish which was a hit, then Mongolian beef. The beef was super tender and well seasoned.  The Hainese chicken rice sucked and that's why they lost another star. Didn't try the sushi or the Thai food, but would def come back."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. The pan seared sea bass is amazing 5/5. 34$ well spent. They bring a side of rice and spicy sauce. Also got the ma pow tofu 18$ 3.5/5.

Partner liked it so much we came back before we left and tried the steamed seabass 3/5. And crunchy tofu 2/5. 

Service is good, they are very attentive. I probably wouldn't come out of my way for this place unless I'm in the area since there are so many other great reastaraunts  on the strip for  the same price but if im in the area I would definitely come back for the pan seared seabass."}
{"text":"I only ended up going here because I was in the mood for sushi at 12am on a Friday night, and this happened to be one of the few places open.  Little did I know that the sushi would be pretty damn expensive.  I mean, sure it was okay, but to double the price of sushi compared to other places?  That's just not cool.

I should've held my appetite and gone somewhere else, personally."}
{"text":"Super fresh sushi and well priced.  Great service, friendly, and quick.  Pretty decor, very convenient if you're staying at the MGM."}
{"text":"After the five hour flight from New York we were STARVING! The gentleman that checked us in suggested The Grand Wok. So we dropped our bags in our room and rushed back down. It was a casual clean decor. The tables were kind of close for my comfort level. We heard all about the girls next to us \"Stupid boyfriends\" but we were so hungry we didn't care. We started with the salt and pepper squid, one of our favorite things to get when we go our for Chinese in Flushing back home. It did not disappoint it was cooked perfectly tender and the fried garlic and diced chili toppings were just like corner 28 on Main Street. Chris ordered the roasted duck with peanut sauce. The skin had a great glaze to it, although it could have been a little crispier. The meat was excellently tender. I order two rolls that came out about twenty minutes after Chris' food. The waitress told us the sushi table was backed up. They should ave held off on his food so we could eat at the same time. We ended up sitting at lunch for almost two hours. Their was too much rice on the rolls for my taste. The fish was super fresh tasting but my avocado was a little too brown.  All in all everything was pretty good but we would not go back. There are far too many places on the strip to go back to one to eat separately."}
{"text":"Phenomenal sushi in a great atmosphere. We ordered one entrée (a chicken curry dish) to share, and each of the five of us picked one sushi roll from the menu. All of the food was wonderful. The eel was the best I've ever had. It was a dish that I've been craving since we left Las Vegas (three weeks now).

The only real critique I have is that the wait service was running very slow. Our little waitress was trying very hard. She buzzed around our table and asked tons of questions. She was very friendly. She just had a tendency to disappear, and it was a LONG time before her initial visit to our table. When you order spicy food, you need water, and we had a heck of a time getting any.

All in all, it was a fine meal."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try. We just checked in and wanted something to eat in our hotel. This place is suppose to be chinese/vietnamese restaurant. I would not recomment this place nor ever come back. We ordered the honey glazed barbecue pork, hanam chicken rice and shrimp pad thai. The shrimp pad thai ($20) was not bad. It was a good portion. The barbecue pork ($17) was okay but the portion was small. I dont see how one person can order this and feel full. The hanamiese chicken rice ($23) was bland and just not worth the price. It was small chicken pieces on bone. It basically was chicken scrap which comes with water down soup and sauce. 
We also ordered sake. I thought it would come in a sake bottle with two glass. Nope! My sake came in a wine glass..... IN A WINE GLASS! This place sells itself as a \"fine dining\" with the ambience and over priced menu however they dont even know simple glassware rules. Its ridiculous. Our waitress didnt explain anything on the menu and she never came back to check up on us. 

To be honest we paid total $100 for the food ($87.56) & tip ($13) and we left hungry. We will probably go get food later on tonight...."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service. We would be regulars if we lived in Vegas. Best Chinese food I think I have ever eaten. Great sushi and wonderful fried rice."}
{"text":"We came to lunch here twice.

The first time, we ordered the fried rice, eggplant and chinese roast pork (char siew). The egg plant was very well done, we absolutely loved it. The fried rice was too dry, it might be because they were not using the right grains. The roast pork was pretty average and too dry. We told the waiter we were in a rush and asked about the waiting time for the food. He assured us that the food would come very fast, and so we decided to order Chinese food instead of some simple sushi rolls. We waited about 15min for the food, which really felt like forever, but I guess is a rather reasonable time :S

The second time, we ordered the fried calamari, hainanese chicken rice, and steamed sea bass. The fried calamari was very well done. The batter was tasty and the calamari chewy and soft. The sea bass was just slightly overcooked in my opinion, but this could be my personal preference. 

The hainanese chicken rice was disappointing for me. Being a Singaporean tasting this Singaporean dish, I had high expectations for it. The chicken, sauces and soup were ok, but the rice was wrong :( The real chicken rice served rice cooked with chicken oil and pandan leaves. This one replaced it with coconut milk rice instead. I guess it could still work, but I'm not a fan of coconut milk rice at all, so I didnt quite enjoy it :( 

If you're interested in overpriced but decently ok Chinese food, this could be the place for you."}
{"text":"Slow service and okay food makes for 3 stars. This place is just one of many restaurants located inside MGM. If you've got dining credits and have a hankering for Asian food, this is your spot. Options range from Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese dishes. I had a sushi roll, and although not bad, it wasn't anything to write home about."}
{"text":"I was glad that the Grand Wok was open late, and on the way to my hotel. The service that we received was more than courteous, and was wonderfully attentive. 

It was a bit smoky in the restaurant, but being along side the casino floor, there's really no escaping that, or whatever floral scent the casino decides to pair with it. It is sectioned off, however, with glass that does seem to help with the smell. 

We ordered the pork fried rice, as well as several sushi rolls. My husband said that the sushi was decent, for LV. I thought that the fried rice was decent as well, but it did have a hint of freezer burnt taste to it that lingered - and I'm never fond of that. My ginger ale also tasted funny, but our waitress was quick to replace it with Sprite, which tasted right.

The pricing is very much in line with LV pricing - we paid $80 for 3 sushi rolls, a huge bowl of pork fried rice and two drinks - a bit much for the quality but for LV, right on point. 

Over all, a decent experience - three stars. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I won't give it a 1 because the food was edible however it was VERY tasteless/bland and over priced. We paid $100 for a sushi roll, 1 noodle dish and a poultry dish with steamed rice and 2 sodas. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Really good meal.  Had the combination fried rice, beef noodles, pan fried sea bass, Singaporean noodles, Chicken lettuce cups. Those dishes were excellent. Had one roll, a red dragon roll and it was so so - I would probably just stick to the Chinese food.  Very nice decor and ambience."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to frequent when visiting the MGM. The food here is usually always great. The servers are familiar faces smiling when they greet us because they know us. 

I ordered the sea bass, roasted duck, and BBQ pork. My guest ordered the lobster soup, and sushi! The Sea Bass tasted amazing as the skin was crispy and the inner meat was moist and cooked to perfection. I can't say anything bad about the duck and BBQ, it was heavenly. The soup was also prepared with so much tasty flavor and spices that it alone could have been a meal of its own. 

Overall, the ambience here is very calming and friendly. The smells coming from the kitchen makes you want to try everything on the menu. The service is top notch! 

My fellow foodies, this place is a must for the Asian Fusion food snob like myself!

PS. The bill came and it was close to 600.00. I was appalled that the lobster soup was 38.00 a cup. I thought it was a bowl shared amongst 7 of us/ nope 7 cups was 210.00 plus... What... But the manager removed 4 cups and gave us a break! Thank you Grand Wok"}
{"text":"WAY overpriced and underwhelming. Waiters hardly speak English. Go to the pan-Asian fast food in the studio walk. Cheaper and same quality food."}
{"text":"This is a pretty place, with lots of glass and light wood.  Because it's such a large, open setting though, it's actually extremely loud.  (No, not because of the casino all around it!)  The large, bustling, open kitchen is a lot of fun to watch.  (I was intrigued by the significant number of older -- past 55 years old, at least -- sous chefs.  They were definitely the largest demographic in the kitchen, which seemed unique.)  The staff was very friendly, patient, and accommodating.  The food was very good and the menu had a huge variety.  Aside frmo the sushi, most of the selection was based on standard US Asian restaurant fare, but with unique takes on things, like the lobster ramen."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside MGM. The waitstaff were nice and attentive, though it took a little while to get the check when we were finally ready to leave. 
We ordered a spicy tuna roll as an appetizer, and it was very delicious. For entrees, we both ordered the ramen. I was very disappointed in it. I am a ramen fiend and this ramen was just not great. The broth was bland and the pork was hard to chew. Definitely not worth the $18 a bowl they charged us."}
{"text":"Excellent stop for one of the best sushi lunches ive had... Excellent atmosphere, service was impeccable, superb menu selection of sushi, sashimi, appetizers, traditional asian courses, very good beer and wine selection (24 oz tsing tao mmm).  They even had a 2 piece sashimi blue fin tuna for $38.00.  I would def return."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner one night without doing any research. Wasn't bad but wasn't anything great either. It's in the back casino area of MGM Grand and it was just your typical Americanized Asian restaurant.

First thing we ordered was hot tea. Being a foodie and lover of asian food, I know that hot tea at real asian restaurants are typically free or very cheap. Hot tea might cost the restaurant $0.05 to make. So since it's in Vegas, Grand Wok charged us almost $9!!! I didn't ask how much it was before ordering since I never paid more then $2 for hot tea in my life.
I admit the Hot Tea was good. Good flavor and nice presentation. 

Also ordered as meals, Pan fried dumplings and Honey Glazed BBQ pork. Both were very good and I was very surprised how good the BBQ pork was. Very tender and full of flavor and the peanuts with it was a good touch.  If it wasn't for a decent meal, I would've given this place 2 stars.

2 appetizers and 1 hot tea cost about $30. Over priced in the real world but normal price for a Las Vegas Restaurant.

Service was good and the decor was nice. I would say this place is a good place to eat if you're with people that like americanized asian food."}
{"text":"I ordered the green beans in XO Sauce.  It said it comes with scallops, but the waitress warned me that the scallops were more like a bacon bit.  She told me to upcharge it with real scallops...totally delicious!!  The only thing keeping it from a 5th star is that I could have used an IPA instead of Asian lagers.  Definitely a good choice!"}
{"text":"You changed my whole life
Don't know what your doing to me with your love
I'm feeling all super human, you did this to me
A super human heart beats in me...at GRAND WOK SUSHI BAR! - Chris Brown (superhuman)

Warning: short review ahead! The chinese food is authentic here - ordered the garlic fried rice (garlic wasn't overpowering, gave it a good kick of flavor) the lobster e-mein (actually taste better here than at normal seafood restaurants!) the won-ton soup (i kinda liked the noodles even though the texture was more stiff than usual) and topped it off with a las vegas roll (i think fried yellowtail was the standout here - trying to remember but can't lol...either way it was alright)

Food: 4.5 stars --- Service: 5 stars --- Atmosphere: 4.5 stars --- Price(value): 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"The food is nothing special to talk about. Came to dine here while staying in Vegas. The service is fast and the staff is friendly. The prices are fair compaired to other restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"My hubby and I stayed at the MGM with 15 of my family members last week post-wedding. We've seriously been eating buffet almost everyday to accommodate everyone's tastes, so we wanted some noodle soup before catching the Le Reve show at the Wynn. Which, by the way, was terribly boring, but at least I had a nice nap! 

So a group of 7 of us decided to just try The Grand Wok since it was the only Chinese restuarant in the MGM that had noodle soup. I ordered the beef stew noodle soup, a couple others ordered the wonton noodle soup and one person ordered the tom yum noodle soup, which is not Chinese but thai. We also ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and pot stickers. 

My noodles were soggy. The soup had a nice herbal flavor though, but could tell it wasn't stewed long enough. Also, the portion wasn't much. The wonton noodle soup though had a pretty decent portion, but the broth was bland. The pot stickers and lettuce wrap weren't bad. 

What can I say, it's Americanized Chinese food, can't expect too much. And I've definitely had much better. But when you have no other choice, I guess it's okay to go and give The Grand Wok a try."}
{"text":"You never know when an Asian snack attack is going to hit, and if you happen to be restless at MGM Grand The Grand Wok is a good option to take care of just about any of your Asian persuasions from sushi to curry to Chinese. Yes, the prices are completely in line with a pricey Strip spot, but the portions actually border on the generous side. I haven't sampled the sushi, so I can't say if that is a strong call. However, I have had their curry at lunchtime, and I was not disappointed. And, when I was in need of something to quell my hunger ahead of a late dinner, I split the braised tofu with the husband. The portion was enough for each of us to be satisfied, and we were pleased with the sauciness. Plus, they have brown rice! Bonus! And, the service is prompt. (They want you back on the casino floor pronto!)"}
{"text":"The best combination fried rice ever.
Great sushi.
Good service.
Have been 20 times.."}
{"text":"One of my fave places to eat because i know its always good. The sushi rolls are always good and fresh. Decently priced for a hotel. I got the fried rice as well but that was only ok. Their duck was good but nothing id get again since i can get it anywhere in chinatown for a lot cheaper. My go to place when i want to eat and am craving Asian food without leaving the hotel."}
{"text":"Rolls are on point. Red dragon roll is the ish. Sit at the sushi bar and let Tomo the sushi chef be your guide. He will not lead you astray. Only 4 stars because it's a bit more pricey than what I'm used to, despite the $$ rating. But still... Yum."}
{"text":"My chicken lettuce wraps were very tasty, but service was kind of blah....our waitress was very busy and we constantly had to flag her down for one thing or another...my friend had some tuna sushi which she said was pretty good as well....for the price, it's a little more upscale than the food court, but not quite 'fine' dining, so my wallet was happy and my tummy satisfied, so I really can't complain too much!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. 
Big plates, small portions.
Texture of the beef didn't seem right - it was like chewing fake meat.
Pork tasted like duck.

Worst experience was seeing a piece of foil in our beef platter. 

We should've walked around MGM more."}
{"text":"Over priced and bad noodle dish. Maybe I ordered the \"wrong thing\" but I got their Malaysian style noodle dish. The squid was like rubber (overcooked) and overall the dish lacked flavor. For $18 or so, i was hoping for it to be way better. The spring rolls were small and average."}
{"text":"The food is okay and tastes good but nothing great for that price. Even the apps were small and over priced. I came here with a big group of 13 and the service was there but would not come as often, we were done eating for 20 min and our dirty plates were still on the table, i saw the waitress was busy but she ignored 13 of us for most of the service. She tried her best as the manager stood there watching not even lifting a finger. This place should not over load one waitress like that if im paying allot for this mediocre food there is more to be expected."}
{"text":"This place was HELLA good why are people hating? The flat noodles we had were SUPER GOOD, the fish for sushi was ON POINT, & the sake was DELISH!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the food we ordered. I will start with the worst. The pad thai was so terrible. I couldn't believe the noodles they used. I don't know what it was but that was not pad thai. Flavors were flat and oh man, the noodles blah. The pho was pretty bad as well. Both the noodles and flavors were not good. The hole in the wall places are sooooooo much better. I can't believe we paid double the price for it. The orange chicken was not bad but not great. It's not bready. The flavor was good but nothing special. The roll was pretty good. I forgot which one we got but I guess the \"and sushi bar\" may potentially have some merit. 

As an Asian person, it was like someone who knew very little about Asian food made the food. It was pricey for no reason except that it's Vegas. The service wasn't bad, they are smiley and try to be attentive even though they were a little slow. Would never go here again."}
{"text":"A very very expensive American-style asian food. Not authentic. The service is slow. Food is quite average. It's lack of depth in flavor and really salty at the same time. Everyone we observed eating there ordered the random asian dishes inspired from various East Asian countries. It's an expensive PF Changs"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the better Cantonese restaurants on the Strip. Expect to pay more than twice the price compare it to a regular Chinese restaurant in your local area. The salt fish chicken fried rice was very good. It's a hit and miss on items on the menu."}
{"text":"Located in the MGM near the cafe. My friends and I came here after just missing 'Wichcraft. First glance at the menu would have you reeling at the prices they charge for Chinese food and make most people go down to Chinatown. Instead of changing venues, we decided on this idea of portion control. Letting the prices persuade us to eat a smaller meal and do another meal later on. 

We started with the Aloha Roll ($14.95). It consists of a spicy tuna center wrapped with yellow tail, salmon, and tuna. The roll was delicious, but not something you couldn't get at any other sushi joint in Las Vegas. That was ok, because the next two dishes were both delicious. The macadamia nut beef strips over noodles ($19.95) was something new that none of us have ever seen before. The meat was so tender and moist. The nuts gave a good contrasting texture to an otherwise singular dish. Then the eggplant in Szechuan sauce ($9.95) was everyone's favorite dish. The sauce was the stand out ingredient. You could toss anything in it and I would probably eat it. The portions are nothing compared to what you would get in Chinatown, but if you have a craving for Chinese on the strip, this is probably the more reasonable of choices."}
{"text":"The first time ,we ordered three items:  1)beef rice noodles  USD18.75        2)sushi   8pcs           3) beef noodles    for FOUR persons , you tasted it better but not enough for you why the dining plate looks like big. The service is nice and friendly. Please follow my picture .  The bill was checked USD 90,including gratuity ."}
{"text":"I really like Grand wok, my only complaint was the food was not very hot when it came out. We had a sushi roll, shrimp and walnuts and mongolian beef.  the beef was like butter, the shrimp had a great taste to it."}
{"text":"Everything about this sushi restaurant was tasteful. The ambience & the sushi was really good. My husband ordered the shrimp fried rice, we ordered the Las Vegas roll & the ramen. The fried rice was the best fried rice we've ever had. The sushi roll was a good portion for the price. The ramen was a first & it was pretty good. The presentation of the food was really neat. 

We had a really hard time understanding our server because she would talk so fast but other than that the service was great. The manager even came to the table to greet us which I thought was a nice touch. We will definitely be back for the shrimp fried rice!"}
{"text":"I was hungry at 2 am and wandering around MGM thinking I'd have to settle for the 24 hr cafe, when I saw that the Grand Wok and Sushi Bar was still open. Since I didn't really feel like diner food I was really happy! I sat at the Sushi Bar, which was Wheelchair accessible. This is a BIG PLUS for me because they usually aren't. I ordered several types of Sushi and a Sake. I had Salmon, Unagi, Hamachi and Garlic Tuna. They all were fresh and delicious. The Tuna was seared and had just a touch of Garlic. The Sake was unfiltered and tasted wonderfully sweet, but was a tad expensive.  Overall, I was quite impressed with the Sushi, especially for a place that doesn't really specialize in it."}
{"text":"Bleh... I'm from LA and I've had waaaaaayyy better sushi and ramen for half the price. So disappointed. Had the spider roll ($16-ate you serious????) and nothing was fresh. Usually I don't comment on Yelp, but I really had to this time because nothing tasted good. Booo"}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere were very nice. The sushi was not good at all though. It's literally grocery store sushi priced double."}
{"text":"I'd return to the Great Wok. We tried many plates:

Appetizers:
- Kim Chi $8 - delicious, but insanely overpriced
- Edamame $8 - insanely overpriced, normal edamame
- Pot stickers $12 - insanely overpriced, but delicious
- Lettuce Chicken Wraps $13 - delicious

Meal:
- Chicken was good
- The steak/meat was the best by far - insanely tender
- Walnut Prawns - big fan, we loved these

Overall, $180 for 4 people. The food was quite delicious I must say. I'd definitely return to this place. It's a bit pricey for lunch, but overall decent Asian cuisine in Vegas."}
{"text":"Mongolian beef was absolutely awful. As in $27 that should have been used at any other Chinese restaurant on the strip. The meat was chunky, not thinly sliced as advertised, and not as original recipe follows. The meat was chewy as is I cut In the middle of each piece and it was red and bloody. I didn't order a filet mignon medium rare. This is such a simple dish, ugh, how you mess it up? The sauce was a sweet and sour sauce-I could see it being poured right out of a bottle, that's how bland this tasted. This was just a wanky version of what I expected. Also he recommended this dish as the best. What? Seriously?

Then, I pointed out how red it was, and he remade it. And guess what, the second time around the meat was exactly the same. Red, bloody and chewy inside. 

I feel like if I went to a 4 or 5 star restaurant the server would gladly exchange for another dish or do something but he was clueless as to why I asked for the check and my bowl was full of the original dish. 

Sorry folks for the rant but I'm highly disappointed for the service and the food. 

This is Vegas! You need your a game at all times-I would not recommend.
Just got to Vegas and this is my first experience. Do not come here. And if you do just drink the alcohol. Don't get the food. 

The service was traditional authentic Asian servers. Nice, but just didn't seem to care that I did not touch my food."}
{"text":"The sushi was great and the other dishes at the table were also very good. The Shrimp Pad Thai however lacked any flavor at all."}
{"text":"Appetizer: Viet Summer rolls - small and flavorless. Peanut dipping sauce was no bueno. 

Sushi: Sea Dragon Roll - Shrimp tempura, Eel, Roasted Garlic with spicy masago and Eel sauce...yeah it was ok at best. The rice was too sticky and really all I tasted was a lot of Eel

Main Dish: Honey Walnut Shrimp- Pretty darn good...shrimp were large and full of flavor. Just the right comonation of salty and sweet. The walnuts were perfect. Just wish this dish didn't cost $27

Side: Abalone Congee- Had high hopes....really bland. No flavor at all. big disappointment! 

Jasmine Dusted Chicken - yeah this dish sounds good. However....what a wasted $22. The chicken was chewy and way over cooked. After a couple bites I pushed it aside. The green beans were good....but I wasn't pleased with paying $22 for green beans. 

Sevice- Had to keep waving down the waiters. They would drop off food or drinks and not return for a minimum of 15 minutes. Sorry....but I could have sworn someone told me this was a fine dining establishment....meaning, I shouldn't be getting Denny's quality service....thanks. 

About $125 after tip for 3 people and no one was really happy when we walked out. Not my idea of a good time. Maybe we should have gone to the buffet."}
{"text":"seaweed salad is standard, same thing you can get at whole foods or any asian grocery store

sushi was just passable.  poorly made but good ingredients.  for example, i had a spicy tuna roll and found fish scales in it.  quite gross.  

shrimp and pork wonton soup was nothing special, exact same thing you can get for $4 at a cheap chinese restaurant

the cantonese roast duck was well seasoned but suffered from being very skinny, as the waiter described it.  very little meat, very little fat, the skin was not crispy at all.  mostly bone and cartilage.  

I agree with Alexander C, this place is EXTREMELY over priced.  The day that I went, the live lobster was $148 for a 2 lb lobster.  $148???  That's steep even for a Vegas restaurant, and this is not some fancy place."}
{"text":"Aside from being pricey sushi, as would be expected from a resort hotel and casino in Vegas, I absolutely loved the two rolls my friend and I split. We sat at the sushi bar. I like certain dining experiences to include seeing how your meal is made. There are tables and there are other Asian entree options aside from sushi. I'm used to AYCE sushi joints, but this was absolutely fantastic for a la carte."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. It's a nice, quick place to get sushi on the strip. I like sitting at the bar. The sushi is fresh and yummy. Go there if you're craving sushi while stuck on the strip- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai!!!!!!!  Excellent service, wonderfully delicious food, and beautiful decor!  Green tea ice cream was a great finish to a fab meal!  I can't wait to get back!  Worth every penny!  $80 for 2 included fresh sushi, pad Thai, seafood clay pot, and dessert for 2 with tip!"}
{"text":"3 stars doesn't express how much I enjoyed our meal here. Yes, Grand Wok isn't a restaurant that one would go out of their way to dine at but it's convenient if you're staying at MGM Grand and appreciate (or in the case of my in-laws, need) Asian food. MGM is not without its Asian options (Shibuya, Hakkasan), but Grand Wok is more affordable and I would argue that the food here is even better than at Shibuya. The menu covers Chinese, Japanese (sort of), and Thai/Singaporean dishes--and while nothing was spectacular, nothing was awful either. For a lot of Asian tourists, a restaurant like this is necessary because burgers, steaks, and pizzas can get real old, real fast.

I recommend skipping the sushi altogether and sticking with the noodle-based and rice-based dishes. We liked the beef chow fun, fried rice, ramen, and honey-glazed walnut shrimp (soo much better than what we had at Shibuya!). Service was attentive and accommodating, and the wait staff definitely made our meal much more pleasant."}
{"text":"So this is on the MGM property, which means you can charge it back to your room at MGM or any of their sisters properties (now that includes many hotels). 
Service is very good. Ambiance is also nice, a modern feel with an Asian twist. 
Food wise, I would say well above average but not a 5 star. 
Overall I would recommend this place if you are after sushi or even after a nice place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Fair at best.  The tuna was marginal in a simple tuna roll and veggies in the tempura roll were too many and not ripe enough. Almost worth sending back. Too many great options in Vegas for good Sushi, this is not one of them."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!

Even though they said that there was about a 30 minute wait, we probabaly only waited for about 10-15 minutes!

The service is a bit slow here, so expect to wait for them to take your order, refill tea/water, and for a box/check when you're done. Besides that, they are friendly, just seems like they're understaffed. 

Don't order the tea!! We ordered 3 cups of tea, they gave us a little pot, which wasn't even big enough to fill all 3 cups. Each cup was $4.50... way too expensive for a cup of tea that they seldom refilled!

Food- this review is only for the cooked food, we didn't try any sushi. For appetizer, we ordered the calamari (yum!) and for entrees, we ordered the Malaysian noodles, Singapore noodles, garlic shrimp fried rice, and the nasi goreng fried rice. They were all tasty! The rice and noodles were cooked so that they weren't clumped together and there was good flavor. I'd say that the most bland one was the garlic shrimp fried rice. My favorite was the Malaysian noodles because it had a lot of seafood in it!

Overall, a nice place for dinner with your family or friends! The prices are expensive for fried rice/noodles, but in Vegas, this was cheaper than many other places."}
{"text":"This place is sanctuary late at night!  There aren't too many selections on the menu if you're going just for sushi and cocktails.  But the sushi I had was very tasty, if hastily made.  The rolls are pretty big, and one order was perfect for me at dinner.  The Feng Shui cocktail is out-of-this-world but sweet as liquid candy!  My boyfriend ordered a bowl with scallops and a variety of veggies, and he ate every last bite.  Definitely a great place to visit if you're hungry at the MGM after 10pm!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Pho. Bean sprouts, mint leaves, sliced jalapeños, hoisin and chili sauces were provided. A big bowl of noodles with about 4 shrimps in it came out. The shrimp was big and succulent. Absolutely delicious! Good broth, good noodles, good everything :D"}
{"text":"If you're looking for \"Asian\" cuisine, you will find it here. I found the food average for Vegas, but the service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Everything tastes very fresh! Much better than most sushi places on the strip. Definitely a favorite."}
{"text":"Had the orange chicken, pad thai noodles, spicy beef, beef brocolli.   Tell you the truth, I wasnt quite impressed.  We just needed a quick bite to eat between our table runs gambling and thought it would be okay.  Food was okay, prices of course were alittle high for the quality but you should expect that at any hotel.  All in all....would only go there again if we needed a quick meal or tier credits"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Very fresh fish and great service! Our server was named Alex if you come here request him & you will definitely enjoy your time! He's a great server I am very impressed with this restaurant!"}
{"text":"For being Vegas this location seems to try really hard to be something to everyone.  Yes it's great to hear the whooshing sound of a hot wok, it sort of sounds like a jet engine coming in for a landing.  However I was expecting just a little more.  The decor while modern feels sterile and the portions were smaller than I would have liked.  I do however like the late night dining option here, as it stay open later than most places in the hotel.  Not as traditional or authentic as one would expect for the area."}
{"text":"dining experience was OK.
First off the seating area is not roomy feels like your up in everybody's business on the table for 2. Service was good except for waiting at least 20-30 mins to get a glass of water. The food was tasty had kung pao chicken plate with a couple of rolls. Overall good experience just felt really uncomfortable  with the super tight seating space from table to table."}
{"text":"Slow service! Ordered philly roll and a spider roll. So much rice on the roll I had to remove it. The philly roll barely had any cream cheese on it. Spicy mayo was good- and friendly waiter."}
{"text":"We got the mongolian beef and panfried flat noodle dishes and they were great. If you're looking for some chinese food and don't want to spend all that much this is a great spot. We didn't get a chance to try their sushi but I would definitely come back again.

Although its in the MGM and you expect it to be expensive, I didnt think it was that bad and the portions were very big. The service was really friendly and seated us quickly."}
{"text":"We ate here TWICE in the week we were in Vegas. The Sushi is HUGE and the other noodle dishes would feed two. The wife and I ordered a couple Sushi rolls and one regular entree and we were stuffed! Appetizers were a little pricey so we stayed away from those. Service was PERFECT! 

Red Dragon Roll and Crunchy Rolls were AMAZING!

If you like Sushi and Noodle dishes this is the place to go in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"One of your run of the mill typical casino restaurants. The food was average. Prices were pretty expensive for the quantity. Sushi was pretty fresh, but the pieces were kind of small for the price (we had the Rainbow roll and a California roll, nothing too extravagant.) Orange chicken had a great flavor, but its consistency was a bit weird. However, my biggest gripe was with the service. Our server was nice (enough), but was always MIA. We never had refills of water and had to wait over 10 mins for her to come back to the table so we could request the check. With the exception of her greeting us and bringing out our food, we never saw her. No  checking up on us to see if we needed anything else, no refilling our drinks....nothing. So very disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a pleasant surprise.   Most of the time I find that the food places in casino's tend to be over priced and low on quality.   I had there dinner special that included a appetizer and entree.   The appetizer had Miso Soup, Vietnamese Summer Rolls with Shrimp and Cucumber Salad with Sesame Dressing.   The appetizer was good but nothing spectacular.   Then I ordered the Beef Tenderloin and Asparagus in
Black Pepper Sauce and this was one of the most delicious entree I had on my whole trip.   The beef was so tender and the flavor was outstanding.   It was not spicy or overly hot and the pepper sauce was good.  I eat a lot of chinese food and it was one of the best dishes I have ever had at a chinese restaurant.   My wife got the garlic shrimp fried rice and it was equally as good.   Next time I go we will get just rice and beef dishes.   Also the service was very good and the waitress was extremely nice.   Overall it was a excellent experience."}
{"text":"Very overpriced Asian food at the MGM Grand on the Strip. Worse, the quality of the food was entirely average. By my standards, a disappointment. If I'm going to pay double what the food is worth, it should be at least as good as most restaurants of the same type, not inferior."}
{"text":"Some of the dishes here are not authentic and bland. It's as if they are scared to shock the white people's  palate with some real asian spice/flavor.

Me and my bf/family always come here whenever we go to Vegas since it's convenient & cures your asian food craving, therefore i've tried quite a few dishes here. As with the sushi area, i only tried their spicy tuna handroll which is your standard handroll so not much to talk about.

I don't remember everything i get but here are some dishes that i'd like to talk about that you should not get

Tom yum koong soup. It is nothing like the ones you get at the thai restaurants. The toppings are sure plentiful with fat shrimp but the broth itself is very bland with only a hint of lemongrass flavor and no spice to it. It also comes with noodles. I don't know why my friend always order like 3 of these at a time!! 

Vietnamese Spring Roll : I wanted something light and fresh so i ordered this and these are not the original viet fat spring rolls.
There was like 6 pieces to the order and each piece is the size/diameter is the size of your finger....maybe a fat FINGER! i was basically eating rice paper.... 

what else.. what else... fried rice and pad thai is pretty standard... malaysian stirfried noodle tasted exactly like pad thai other than the fact that the malay noodles were round/thick....

 The food is all pretty average and will get you by with your asian food craving other than the dishes i mentioned above."}
{"text":"Service is great, but the food is so so. I ordered the salted fish and chicken fried rice and I couldn't taste the saltiness at all, zero salty, bland, rice a bit on the hard side. However the Stir Fry Udon with XO sauce is flavorful, so I at least enjoyed that."}

Overall:

Not recommended. Would work if you really have no other option but you do so don't.

Parking:

Typical strip parking. Valet at mgm, self park, walk or taxi.

Establishment:

Service was good. No complaints. Decor was typical Asian theme with a sushi bar.

Food:

The pad Thai was visibly drenched in oil which is always a bad sign. It was okay (mostly because of all the oil they put on it) it lacked flavor. *1 star*

The fried rice was just as bad drenched in oil but at least had some seasoning on it.  *2 stars*

Some kind of ramen essentially just miso soup with ramen noodles and toppings. *1 star*

Curry was just bland. *1 star*"}
