{"text":"The dumplings, noodles and three vegetable dish were all amazing! And half price on a booze!!! So happy to have them in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"La nourriture est très bonne et se rapproche de la cuisine authentique chinoise! Le staff est amical et la place grande avec un coin intime qui a l'air très sympa pour les groupes. En ce moment il y a toujours l'alcool à moitié prix !    Food and ambiance are great. Reasonable price too !"}
{"text":"Such a nice find! Hot and sour soup was the best I ever had and the dumplings were delicious. You can choose between steamed, fried or in a chicken broth. Loved the quality of the food. We will be back, thank you!"}
{"text":"Je suis très content qu'un restaurant de dumplings ait ouvert dans le coin. Je suis allé avec un groupe d'amis samedi soir dernier et les dumplings étaient excellents. De plus, les prix sont raisonnables et les employés sympathiques.   Bravo. J'y retournerai certainement."}
{"text":"I am not sure why others gave it a great review. I was very disappointed for many reasons. If I could, I would give it 0 stars. 1) first thing, the tables were not very clean.  2) The dumplings were not very good at all.  It is the worst that I have ever had. Skin is rubbery and the meat inside was very hard and dry. Proper dumpling should be moist and juicey and smooth. 3) fried dumplings were burnt. Dumplings are best in Chinatown."}
{"text":"If you think Chinese food in the Little Italy of French Canada can't be good, well...you've got another thing comin'!  Three of us dumpling boys popped in here yesterday and boy, were we not disappointed.  I saw that Boone Boy had ordered his 'soup style,' and I thought 'mmm I think I'm going to do the same.'  And I was happy.  The TV was showing a women's fitness competition, which was a surprisingly nice compliment to our delicious dumplings.  Three thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Checked out this new spot last night with a handful of friends. They've only been open month which might explain why it was pretty quiet--the food is definitely not the reason!  The menu includes skewered meats, hand made noodle dishes, homemade dumplings and a bunch of other appetizers.   The food we ordered was tasted and well received by all. The fried eggplant stuffed with pork was very flavourful, the shrimp are large and crispy, the spring rolls are pretty good too.   We had a few vegetarians so we asked if they might make a general tao tofu since they had the chicken version on the menu. Not only did they happily agree to make it, they also offered to make some tofu and veg dumplings for us. Both hit the spot. We were brought free samples as well which was very thoughtful.   The noodle dishes and the dumplings were the highlight for me. Noodles are thick and have a good bite and the garnishes are fresh and well balanced. The meat dumplings were juicy and generously stuffed. Dipping sauce were on point.   The one thing that was less well received was the cold tofu appetizer. Next time we'll try the fried one.   And, maybe a limited time thing, ALL booze was 50% off. Prices were already decent so this made it really cheap, yay!   Overall, I liked the food, service was great and prices were fair. Will definitely be back. Very happy to have this in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Nice dumpling spot in little Italy! We had 24 and we were two and it was more than enough. The flavors are amazing ! We even took an extra order to go. Service was a bit slow, but it was a busy night. Good place for a cheap dinner.  2nd time there. Service still slow. But food is good."}
{"text":"A Première vue ça a l'air de rien, mais attèle-toé le monsieur patate parce que t'es papilles vont avoir une série d'orgasmes incontournable! Ca fait deux fois que je viens. Ce sont mes Dumplings préféré à Montréal. Le serveur est tellement chill que j'aimerais ça que ça soit mon frère. Le service est bon. La bouffe est exxxxxcélen- tissimo (on est dans le quartier Italien après tout!) Le décors est sympa. C'est convivial. J'ai pu d'idée. Mais vous voyez le topos. Passe par ici au plus vite avant que t'en reste pu!"}
{"text":"The dumplings are fantastic and come in a huge variety that I'm really looking forward to exploring over time. So far, I've only had the beef & coriander ones (steamed), but they were big, juicy and super flavourful. I think I'll try some fried ones next, and I can hardly wait.   As for the rest of the menu, I've only tried the wonton soup and the General Tao chicken so far, but they were both great. The broth in the soup was perfect, and the General Tao was crispy without being too hard, and just the right amount of sweet (really tasty but not at all overpowering).  The portions aren't very big and the prices aren't very low, but the food is super fresh and expertly made on the spot, and the service is warm and welcoming. Plus, quality Chinese comfort food is something that's been lacking in the area, so I hope this place will thrive and continue to fill that gap. I look forward to going back with friends and working my way through the menu."}
{"text":"I've been to China the past three summers and the food at Etoile Rouge reminded me of the food I ate over there instantly. I ordered the pork brochette and it smelled authentic. Then I tasted it and it was like I was right back in China. It was great."}
{"text":"Came across this hidden gem in the heart of Little Italy and loved it!  The resto itself is cozy and has back room area for small group reservations. Now let's get down to the food!  The dumplings were absolutely delicious ...fresh ingredients and packed with flavor. You can ask them for peanut butter sauce on the side or they have a home made picant sauce that accompanies their amazing dumplings!  Dumplings come in different fillings and they have choice of steamed or fried.  I would definitely recommend ordering different types and sharing with friends! The resto also has other classic asian dishes such as noodles and rice....we also had the chicken vegetable noodles and loved it!  This was truly and authentic asian experience! Service is also super warm and friendly. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed. I knew it was a bad omen when they had to scrounge for obsolete English menus, which I had to cross-reference with the French menus on the table. We waited forever for our food. We ended up ordering an appetiser to tide us over, but it still took way too long to get our dumplings. The management ended up giving us a free wakame salad because of the wait, reiterating that the dumplings are handmade. Handmade and made to order are not the same, and it's probably not smart to make to order on a busy Friday night. When the dumplings arrive, they were all mixed up and the waitress didn't identify which was which. The dough was thicker than I was expecting and water dripped out of them when you bit into them. Not impressed; there are better dumpling restos out there."}
{"text":"Ce local maudit (on y a vu 2 restaurants fermer tour à tour, qui à mon goût n'étaient pas trop invitants désolée!) a enfin trouvé un digne héritier qui je l'espère restera longtemps dans le quartier.  Tout d'abord le personnel est hyper sympathique. D'ailleurs lorsque nous avons commandé des oeufs de cent ans (fermentés), la serveuse nous a fait un petit regard complice du genre \"hmmm vous êtes sûrs que vous voulez commander ça pour votre première visite?\". Mais malgré ses avertissements et ses suggestions pour que les oeufs passent mieux, nous les avons mangés sans aucune hésitation tels quels, et WOW quelle surprise! Il ne faut surtout pas s'attarder à l'image et la texture inhabituelle (ils sont noirs/transparents???), c'est un vrai délice une fois en bouche. Ils ont gagné la 5ème étoile directement dans mon coeur!   Les dumplings sont minutieusement préparés à la main sur place, à la commande, donc cela peut paraître un peu long pour certains mais cela ne nous dérange pas personnellement. Nous avions une bonne bouteille de sake pour patienter, et leur saveur valait vraiment l'attente.  J'aime beaucoup l'ambiance et le mobilier en bois, et je pense que c'est une bonne place pour réserver en groupe et partager différentes assiettes de dumplings. Les prix sont raisonnables et pour l'ouverture l'alcool est offert à -50% (durée limitée bien sûr). Une belle option de sortie réconfortante sur le boulevard Saint Laurent."}
{"text":"I've been back here a bunch. When you give a place 5 stars there's lots of context to consider and in this case the stars are in part reflective of the sad fact that there are basically no real Chinese options in this area, and I love Chinese food and this place is good.   They have really tasty vegetarian options, including a bunch of different vegetarian dumpling fillings including some delicious ones with tafo and eggs. It's such a relief to find super tasty vegetarian food that actually gives you protein.   The service has gotten better here over time, quick and friendly. I've tried a lot of the menu items and the flavours are complex and great and I'm super happy this spot is in my neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Pour l'instant c'est l'endroit ou j'ai mangé les meilleurs dumpling... et j'en ai essayé quelques uns.  Le personnel est sympathique et le service était rapide. Certes vous ne voyez pas la fabrication devant vous mais tout semble bien frais. Les gouts étaient bien équilibré et il n'y avait pas trop d'eau dans les dumpling. La décoration simple et efficace, je vous le recommande."}
{"text":"I haven't tried any of their dishes yet, but their dumplings are fantastic, and their home-made noodles are very solid as well.  Service is very friendly."}
{"text":"Déco rétro chinoise des années révolutionnaires avec les émissions chinoises qui jouent dans l'arrière plan. Le restaurant est propre et chic. Les propriétaires viennent du Nord-est de la Chine et les nourritures sont très authentiques. J'ai essayé leurs plats Disanxian, dans le description duquel qu'on peut lire \"similaire à la poutine\", délicieux. Je recommande également les saucisses faits maison et leurs piments faits maison (libre-service sur les tables).  Contente d'avoir un restaurant chinois authentique dans le coins!"}
{"text":"Brochette et assiettes à l'honneur dans ce petit nouveau resto du quartier. Le menu est assez varié et on peut choisir plusieurs alternatives. L'ambiance est un mélange de rétro et moderne. On profite de son repas avec des téléviseurs qui diffuse de la musique chinoise actuelle. Le staff est gentil et prêt à nous conseiller."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my boyfriend. He ordered general tao. I ordered dumplings.. Not only was the general tao sauce seemingly straight out of a bottle, but his dish was brought out 45 minutes before mine. When the waitress realized how long I spent waiting for my dish, she ran out of the restaurant to chain smoke and call someone to come finish her shift... thats what seems to have happened from what I gather. I kid you not. Totally unacceptable! Bummer of an experience and I'll (sadly) probably never go back."}
{"text":"Another great find thanx to yelp. Firstly their spice was amazing and with a heavenly smell. Dumplings were awesome as we had lamb with cumin and fried with coriander.eggplant so good. Maybe a little sweet but it hit the G spot. I will be back."}
{"text":"I personally get never impressed with chinese food or their way of managing restaurants. Sadly, this one failed me as well. The pork dumplings had this weird meat smell and also the general tao chicken came with rice soaked in sauce. I will need to drink 2 gallons of water after."}
