{"text":"This is strictly a take away place that combos as a pizza joint and an Indian / Halal specialty. Decided to try the pizza side. The menu offers a standard variety of toppings and sizes. They do have some good combo deals as well. Went for two 12\" pies and chicken wings. A good deal for 34 bucks! Cheese pizza for the kids (fussy little rotters) and a donair-topped pie for the adults. Both pizzas were good, comparable to Little Caesar's or Papa John's. They were fresh and hot as were the wings. This breaded and fried beauties were the typical wing with a drizzled with hot sauce. Give it a try. Good for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Their butter chicken is awesome, as can be expected, their donairs are awesome and their pizza is pretty good as well. We order the butter chicken quite often and have their donairs every few months and stop in for the occasional slice of pizza on the way home when we're in need of a quick and easy snack."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum........ i ordered a Hawaiian pizza with extra pineapples and it was perfect. The crust was crispy and soft in the centre just the way I like it. Good amount of tomato sauce and the toppings didn't fall off after the first bite.  It's a fast food chain that severs really good Indian food, donair and pizza..... kinda weird but who cares when it taste so good. This place is take out only there's no tables. Call in advance to order because it's super busy during peek hours. Took 35 minutes for a 12\" pizza. Lots of parking, friendly service and cheap food. Definitely a good choice for any lazy night!"}
{"text":"We have had the Indian food here which is good, the pizza which is just ok, but the stars here are the donairs or the shawarma. They pack them full here, and the meat is shaved fresh not taken out of a drawer. Lots of topping choices and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great bang for buck  By far the best donair pizza in town. We've tried many other places and it does not compare. The sauce is what makes it."}
