{"text":"Great pizza it's different from your ordinary pizza places i recommend this place if your ever near by this location . Pizza was made fresh and tasted amazing ."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time and ordered a small deluxe uno.  The pizza was a good size with huge toppings.  I placed an online order which was ready at the set time.  Overall, good pizza and I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love marco's pizza. They are the best. Since I started ordering from here I will not order from anywhere else. My pizza is always fresh and hot and the service is always top notch. The delivery driver is always fast and friendly. The online ordering is super easy to use and I can add the delivery drivers tip right to my bill."}
{"text":"This review is based on my first visit.

The pizza was hot and full of flavor. The pepperoni has that genuine sausage-y flavor that you get at real pizza shops. We also ordered a chicken, spinach, white pizza that was delicious. It's not too pricey if you order with a coupon. 

I love the online ordering option, You can build a custom pizza online or alter their signature or special pizzas."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed sorry delivery was timely delivery guy was very nice but food wasn't good"}
{"text":"First few orders were fine, MY LAST order it was missing TWO crust toppers that we specifically ordered because we get no sauce on our pizza. The cheese also was spread unevenly on the pizza like they didn't care. So i call in explaining my missing items & i'm now home with a cold pizza that we cant eat or enjoy so i would like it remade. They insist on asking me several questions over the phone, insulting me telling me they used correct amount of cheese... the main issue was its missing my crust toppers. MOST places will just remake it. There is a girl here with RED / PINK hair name she said started with an A. At first she wouldn't give me her name, are they required to wear name tags here?? No employee's had names. Anyways, she was very rude argued with me when i got there, still insisting she was in the right.. I told her i'm the customer, i order food, you make it plan an simple, how can she get it right times before but yet this time the system didn't tell her?. SHE pursed to get into a arguing matching with me over it, in front of customers & employee's telling me its there system n she knows how to make a pizza. I asked to pull up my receipt on machine she refused..saying she knows its wrong. She handled the whole simple remake me a pizza thing VERY VERY unprofessional & needs to be RETRAINED on customer service skills. She needs to realize without the customer she has no JOB. YOU have now lost my business & i was a weekly customer... i will tell everyone i know to boycott this location..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! Best Pizza I've Had In A Very Long Time  Can't Wait To Order Again"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service. Never enough people working there and I don't know how one company can eff up pizza so bad, but they excel at it.  Phone orders take at least 15 between \" please hold\" and \"give me one minute\" only to have to repeat your order at least 3 times.  Kind of makes me feel they should hire college grads instead of middle schoolers.... please..... go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I do not live in Las Vegas, I live in Los Angeles; however my mother lives in Las Vegas, a few blocks away from Marco's Pizza. Every time I visit my mom, I like ordering from Marco's pizza. Pizza is my daughter's favorite food and she loves Marco's pizza! I usually order delivery but I have once ordered for pick-up. The young ladies who work there are very friendly and welcoming. I especially love their Greek salad. Great tasting pizza overall!"}
{"text":"8:10pm phone order:

Used MAILED COUPON $13.99 two-top pizza XL, specifically asked for hot sauce & ranch FOR THE PIZZA!

Used MAILED coupon for FREE cheesy bread that can be used with other coupons, asked if red sauce & ranch came with it, they said\"YES\".

Made sure we had all 4 sauces! Was told our delivery will take 45 mins. 

9:08pm: delivery showed up.

Charged $17.99 pizza & NO HOT SAUCE. Asked delivery guy how much total was, he said \"Well I guess it's $4 off from the total right?.\" I meant HOW MUCH WAS THE TOTAL SO I CAN MINUS THE $4 OFF MYSELF.

We asked for hot sauce, he said \"U ordered hot sauce?\" We said we asked specifically separate sauces for the pizza & asked if the cheesy bread came with red sauce & ranch & you said yes. He said Sorry & he will come back to drop some off.


THIS IS AT LEAST THE 4TH TIME WE HAD OUR ORDER INCORRECTLY DELIVERED!


9:46pm: I called the cell number of the driver & he said \"Yes, I'm still delivering the hot sauce, I'm just waiting for another delivery\" I said might as well have not ordered if I have to wait 2 hrs for my order to be delivered correctly! He said \"It's not 2 hrs It's only 1 hr & 15 mins,but ok.\" WOW! What a response! So helpful of him! AND HE HUNG UP ON ME!!!!


Over the phone he referred to the supervisor as a \"she\". Must be only 2 ppl working because they sounded busy. The man who took our order was the same man who delivered because his voice matched. Also told us that he was the one we spoke to during the delivery. The supervisor woman gave the phone to the man, and he kept saying she was too busy to talk to us. She was JUST on the phone with me, and must've been telling the man to tell me to call back because I could hear him speaking to her. She did NOT want to speak to me. They told me to call back tomorrow after 4:30pm to speak with Jay (woman General Manager). Very upset because more than half of my total orders from this place has been WRONG!!!! I feel bad reporting this situation b/c I am NOT trying to get anyone in trouble, I am simply trying to get my orders right! And on time!!!!! This is very frustrating! It is obvious these employees are being spread too thinly and seem too stressed. They tried to be polite but not enough. was very frustrating because they could not give me any solutions just condescending answers!!!! We placed our order at 8:10pm, 9:45pm - I'm still waiting of the hot sauce I was promised.

THE ONLY REASON I ORDERED AGAIN FROM THIS PLACE IS CUZ THEY MAILED US THESE COUPONS! WELL, IT WORKED FOR THEM! BUT NOT FOR US!

NOT ORDERING FROM THIS PLACE EVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"If for some creepily strange reason you have yet to try Marcos STOP WHATEVER YOURE DOING and go order there cheesy bread. Once you've inhaled the entire box feel free to virtually high five me. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Can't say enough great things about this store. Ordering is a breeze, the food arrives on-time and hot, and the employees are very nice and professional."}
{"text":"Pizza is THEEEE BEST!!! They serve pizza with different flavored crust.  Employees are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I have to say it was OK....but prices could be better...they advertise about friends don't let friends eat five dollar pizzas...I have to say for the price of their pizzas I would go to the five dollar place...the staff was great ...loved them"}
{"text":"We went to this place after a friend recommended it to us. Their pizza is delicious and different from what you can get anywhere else. The service was fast and friendly. Only thing I didn't like was that it was a tiny bit pricier and the pizza was really greasy."}
{"text":"Seriously yummm!! Super cheesy with buttery crust! The magnifico is our fav! So glad it close and offer delivery."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and delicious pizza! Pizza was very cheesy and full of toppings! Definitely get your money worth here!"}
{"text":"I Am so happy this new pizza place opened near our house because the taste is awesome and they have pretty great deals like their Extra Large big cheesy is my absolute favorite but they offer sweets and wings and Yum!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was really good, fresh ingredients, overall tasty pizza. Their veggies were really fresh, not like most pizza places where they usually are soggy & slimy."}
{"text":"Brand new pizza shop at Cheyenne /215 so thought we would see how it was.....lots of specials !!!! We used a coupon got the large pepperoni magnifico and garlic bread sticks  for 12.99.  Awesome, awesome deal very good pizza, a little greasy but I love that.  The bread sticks were the bomb.....so good with garlic dipping sauce on the side. .....will get the sticks everytime. We will definitely order from again, super fast delivery and you can order online,  so next time you're in the area looking for pizza...give Marco's a try you won't be disappointed  !!!!"}
{"text":"Marcos Pizza is our new found place when it comes to pizza. The Pizza's are delicious and great service. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"The pizza taste pretty good and flavorful. The crust itself had a good taste to it. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Was told an hour and a half for food upon ordering with delivery. Ok. Over 2 hours have gone by, and nothing. I call and they said they had no one to deliver, and they'd be right there.

Why can't you call and tell the customer they can't deliver? It's been almost a half hour since I called and still no delivery. I'm going to have to go and pick it up myself, which I would of done in the first place, but that's not the point. 

I'm a person with a lot of patience, but I've definitely lost a lot of patience right now. Bad customer service

Update: when I went to go pick it after waiting almost 3 hours, they said it was actually on its way to my house. I drove home, and still wasn't there. Finally came about 10 minutes after I got home. Let's just say, they didn't get any tip, and I always give tips no matter how bad service was. 

And they don't even know how to make wings, they drizzle the sauce on it"}
{"text":"Tried this pizza for the first time tonight. It was so good!!!!! I was going to order a 5$ pizza from my usual pizza place but I'm glad I spent a little more for Marcos. It's definitely worth the extra few bucks. I'll never buy a 5$ pizza again. This is my favorite place now. Try the \"delux uno\". The sauce, dough, and toppings are delicious. The cashier was really friendly too (wish I got her name) hopefully she's working when I go back next week so I can add her name to my review."}
{"text":"The pizza here is good,but the cheese bread is where it's at!!. It's so good, sometimes I order just cheese bread, trust me , you need to try them!! Lol"}
{"text":"I love Marco's pizza, I recently tried it because my friend works there and she recommended it. Their ingredients were fresh, and I especially love their crust topper options. I added Roma seasoning and garlic to my pizza, it tasted amazing and my hands were covered in garlic butteriness afterwards, but I've never complained about that."}
{"text":"I been here 3 times since the opening and its been good everytime. Their pizza is pretty good, and it tastes extremely similar to Peter Piper Pizza which is not a bad thing by any means. Their regular crust is very thick so I'd recommend thin crust if you don't want too much carbs. Their wings are also very good but they are tiny and explains the cheap price. 

The service here is really nice and all the workers are friendly. Overall, although it's not the best pizza I've ever had, it beats any fast food pizza places and I'll most likely order from here whenever I need a pizza fix instead of the pizza hut across the street."}
{"text":"They just opened by my house...I had low expectations...um but their pizza was awesome!!! loved it!"}
{"text":"I love there pizza it has to be the best pizza. There always so fast and nice in that store !"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best pizza I've had and I've had a lot of different pizzas to compare it to! Too bad you don't have one near my house. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"This is our third time ordering from Marcos and it has been perfect every single time! From the friendly people answering the phones to the absolutely wonderful delivery people it is a grade A experience. This will forever be our go to pizza place now!"}
{"text":"The food is greasy, the service is slow and it is usually cold by delivery. We ordered twice and that was two times too many."}
{"text":"I was very impressed by my first experience! I ordered online and they called me when my order was going to take awhile. They had 1 driver. I've worked in food service so I understand being short handed. Love the pizza and subs, salads too! So it's worth the wait! I'm originally from long island NY so I know good pizza! Plus I know finding my house is a pain in the butt. Thanks for your service!!  I'll be ordering again."}
{"text":"Good Pizza.  It's  always flavorful.  A bit on the greasy side though.  They send me coupons periodically. Online ordering is convenient"}
{"text":"We stopped by here last night as we were craving pizza and this was on the way.
Marco's is a pizza franchise that has been around for decades. They close at 11 pm. Located next to Carpriotti's. There are some tables and the place is clean. They have good amount of menu options, a bit of variety with sides, subs, salads, and desserts. 

We ordered the Deluxe pizza, which is their most popular and has pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, onions, 3 cheese and their signature sauces. We ordered it thin crust with black olives. The medium size is $14.99.  It took 20 mins. The crust is fluffy and crispy but not doughy. I want to try the wings next time.

The staff is friendly. Some say the prices are a bit higher than other national pizza chains but I am not sure about that. The quality of food is ok."}
{"text":"A little disappointed. Ordered over the phone for a pick up and the employee who answered had no idea how to take an order, the person answering the phone should know the menu and also the coupons. Pizza was pretty tasty.. crust was dry"}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza ! Love it  ! Better than many  other pizza ! They have special sauce and the pie just right !"}
{"text":"Pizza is great. Stick with pizza. Classic crust is delicious. Pepperoni Magnifico quickly becoming a favorite! Cheese is salty goodness.
Finally a decent pizza place to order from in the neighborhood. Baked well adds a nice option for a little browning of the cheese. 

BUT tonight we ordered the wings extra crispy with a side of hot and bleu cheese. The wings came piping hot in a tightly sealed container. Unfortunately without a vented container of some type, the wings steamed themselves soggy on the way to our house. Not a bit soggy, completely soggy. I figured they would still be good dunked in the hot sauce and bleu cheese, but looking through everything, my side of hot sauce was missing from the order although printed on the receipt. 

My advice? Again, stick to pizza. If you NEED wings or even strips, I would definitely order them takeout only."}
{"text":"Oh my lord, just to start off, the customer service, absolutely the worst customer service ive ever recieved, a blond bigger woman maybe named lindsay? There is no way she got past grade 10... she had such a musty odor i could not deal with it.immediately lost my appetite, the way that they make the pizza was unremarkably disgusting, toppings all messy and were not even when i asked for a half and half, my gluten free cheese only had anchovies on it! How!?!?!?! 10/10 do not reccomend, and may i just say the prices are so bad, can just as easily go to pizza hut and save $30"}
{"text":"Just had some good ole Marcos Pizza one of the better pizza places we have around this area. The delivery guy was pretty cool and even wished us a Happy Thanksgiving! Whenever I think pizza this is one of the places that always come to mind for a very good quality pizza pie. Papa Murphys can't even shake a stick at Marcos. If you want less greasy, good for the family style pizza go ahead and give Marcos a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"It's very average pizza. It's way to expensive for what you get. Not sure if it's just that the employees throw food together without caring or that all Marco pizza are average. Very salty pizza sauce. Delivery drivers are friendly tho."}
{"text":"Average pizza. It's comparable to pizza hit hand tossed pizza. Very greasy. Also the big disappoint is the price for the pizza. It's very expensive for a chain pizza company. You can go to dominos or pizza hut and get a pizza for half the cost. I don't intend on going back here for future pizza orders."}
{"text":"Ok, so being new to Vegas and being new to this area, I decided to give this newly opened pizza joint a try. this is my new favorite Pizza place. I ordered your basic pepperoni cheese pizza and it was perfect! Cheesy, crunchy and piping hot. Loved everything about my pizza from the sauce, to the cheese and even the pepperoni's weren't super greasy like some other pizza places, but really for me, its the sauce, and bread that makes a good pizza, I feel this pizza is an EXCELLENT value for the price! Awesome staff too, friendly and welcoming. I know it sounds like I work at this place but I don't lol! my pizza was honestly just that good, and the customer service I experience by the people working at this location made my visit 5 stars. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place truly has the best pizza in Vegas. My wife had a bad experience in the past and always discouraged me from going. I waited until I tried twice before putting review in. The deluxe is fantastic.  Pricing high but if you can find a coupon or special it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. Good pizza reasonably priced.   Located at the far end of shopping center where publix is located."}
{"text":"$26 for a large supreme meat pizza and cheezy sticks seemed extremely expensive, especially for a restaurant that you can't sit down in. Fortunately, the quality of the meats and cheese justified the price. It's not the best pizza I've ever had, but the quality is definitely worth the price difference between the other pizza delivery chains. Don't miss the chance to get a pizza at Marco's"}
{"text":"I attempted to order online I entered my address and then I entered my order and credit card information and submitted it and it said we don't deliver to that address. That should have come up as soon as I entered my address it wasted 20 minutes of my time"}
{"text":"I used to like this place, but tonight we ordered pizza around 7pm, they said it would be half hour to an hour for delivery. It's now 9:30pm, i was on hold for half hour, when I called to cancel it finally arrived at 9:33, it had been made over an hour and fifteen minutes ago! Ridiculous! I had time to download yelp and put this comment on in the time I was on hold. We cancelled or order, who wants cardboard pizza?!"}
{"text":"A relative of mine REALLY loves Marcos and insisted on ordering it repeatedly. I do appreciate the garlic butteriness of the crust. Mmm there can never be enough garlic. 
It's greasy and the flavors aren't overwhelming."}
{"text":"This location sucks. So over getting food from here. The employees don't give a crap about making the food right. Either it's burnt or sloppily made with lack of ingredients. I've literally received a cheezy bread with hardly annnnnyy cheese on it. It was basically just bread sliced up w a touch of butter and the skimpiest amount of cheese ever. I'd rather drive to the fort mill location on gold hill road for true Marcos deliciousness cause this location blows"}
{"text":"This is my new pizza joint. It's not the best amazing pizza you've ever had, but it's by far the best delivery pizza place. The sauce was really good. The ingredients tasted fresh."}
{"text":"We had some amazing pizza here. It was the best around, and we come from Pizza Central NYC. Will post delicious pics . Check it out!"}
{"text":"So I order food then got a call that the driver was outside knocking on my door negative driver was at the wrong apt ok call the store they told me they would call the driver which was still lost great I finally call store back told them to cancel the order the driver shows up seconds later I tell them forget just give me the food driver says I cancelled it ok but my card was charged call the store again you charged my card still didn't give me the food I paided for its going to be 3 days hell na first off I haven't ever had this problem with this store I ask for contact info for the district manager of the store they tell his name is Paul can I have his contact information Lize says no he be at the store some time this week seriously horrible customer service mind you my card was still charged but I have no pizza seriously"}
{"text":"Good pizza even tho they forgot my sauce. The   pizza and bread sticks automatically 5 Star."}
{"text":"So I will start this out is I generally don't eat pizza, Red sauce gives me heartburn. So we ordered the white double cheesy pizza which is with white sauce and bacon, added double mushrooms, pepperoni and black olives. As you can see I don't Yelp much, my wife gave the order over the phone the person taking the order (she) could  seem to care a less of what she was ordering. Pizza came and we soon found out there is just a normal pepperoni pizza with olives and black mushrooms. My wife decide to call and let them know that it was not what we ordered, the response on the phone was Ok sorry about that. I just hope the owner trains their employees better, this is a fairly small neighborhood word will get out quickly, I never asked for something for free but the lack of caring what your customers think is not a good way to run your business, just because you are there does not mean your customers will be"}
{"text":"Consistently good pizza, for a low price and always delivered faster than quoted. It is not gourmet, but for 15 bucks on a lazy Friday we feed a family of 4 with pizza and cheesy bread."}
{"text":"Been craving pizza all week, so we ordered some delivery. Large deluxe pizza, large bread, and a large Greek salad came to just shy of $40 bucks but it fed the two of us for 2 days, haha so I'd say it was completely worth it. Pizza was delicious, the cheesy bread is sooooo good with that garlic butter sauce. Delivery time was reasonable for a Sunday night on a holiday weekend. No complaints. Will have to use these coupons to try some more :)"}
{"text":"This review is before I ate the food.  Their online site has specials that when you click to choose then say only valid for particular days.  They also charge for 2 toppings when you order 1 topping on left side and 1 on right side.  Only place that does this.  Also the blonde that was working register didn't know how to work it - had to get assistance.  She didn't also understand when I asked for separate bags for the 2 breads with sauces as I told they were going to 2 different homes.  She then made a rude comment thinking I didn't hear.   I will go back to the pizza place down the street and recommend for everyone else to do the same.  Not good for a new business."}
{"text":"Marcos Pizza is good for a quick and cheap pie.  Nothing special but not bad either.  

I made the order for 2 large pizzas.  One with just cheese and the other with sausage and mushrooms.  15 minutes later I made the drive to pick them up.  They were already ready when I walked in.  Paid the cashier and brought them to my folks place.  

I'm more of a fan of Joey's Pizza in this part of town.  But, trying something new, every once in a while, is good to appreciate what you like, or to find a new favorite.

I would probably order another pizza here as my folks like it more than I do."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see a Marco's open up the street from me. I have seen them in the Midwest, but never out here. I stopped in one night and ordered Pizza, Breadsticks and a Salad. Delicious!! Then I tried the Sandwiches with a salad. Delicious!! Since, I have been back many times and so have both kids. The food is awesome, the place is CLEAN, and they Excel at Customer Service. The Pizza Taste was remarkable, and the rest was equally as good. They do not skimp on quality. The prices are great and the food is presented well. portions are more than adequate. I suggest you try Marco's. I also had an experience the other day with one of their delivery drivers. Her name was Destiny. She was so Professional, Polite and very Neat in Appearance. I wish I could have found employees like her when I was a business owner! A note to Marco's: Keep doing what you are doing and don't change a thing. I Love your food, service and both dining in and delivery! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good here, the chicken wings are just ok. The prices are higher than a regular pizza place and the taste is maybe two notches above Pizza Hut. But I order every once in a while because the service is good, and once you start to order with them, they send you coupons and cute little letters in the mail saying they miss you (when you haven't ordered in a while)."}
{"text":"Very happy with my pizza and wings and the customer service was refreshing!   I was acknowledged as soon as I walked in the door even though all employees were very busy.  The employee who helped me was very courteous and very pleasant   I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Chicken Fresca is undoubtably the best pizza you will have in the fast food sector. Amazing must try if you haven't already!! You will love it..."}
{"text":"I have gone to all the Marcos pizza locations in Las Vegas. This is my favorite pizza. The girls there are always really happy and nice there. I always feel welcomed !!! Fast great service!! They have a great new pizza, Roma Meats.. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty awesome there, wings were horrible and mushy,  online checkout is always malfunctioning, and prices are a little high,  but you know what? That is some darn good pizza."}
{"text":"Love love love Marcos pizza!! Was so happy to hear that they were opening a location near my house. This is my go to pizza, hands down! The ingredients are fresh and staff is always friendly. I ordered 2 pizzas for Super Bowl and they had my order ready promptly in 30 mins as they had told me. Everyone loved the pizzas as there were a few who were unfamiliar with Marcos but after trying it, have become huge fans. Keep makin' those mouth watering pizzas!"}
