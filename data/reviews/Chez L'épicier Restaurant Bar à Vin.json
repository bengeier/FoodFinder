{"text":"We really enjoyed the overall experience - the service and food were definitely above average....we all agreed just a little lacking for a 5 star level.
For a table of 4, we started off with the Cold Asparagus Soup, Duck Wrapped Scallops and 1/2 Dozen Raw Oysters.  The soup was out of this world good - very fresh with a great spicy, asparagus flavor.  The scallops were just ok and the oysters were very small with limited flavor @$18.
For entrees - the Filet was a hit (cooked just right with nice flavor) and the Suckling Pig was really good (the mashed potatoes stuffed inside added a great flavor).  The Risotto had a weird flavor to it that was not pleasant (just couldn't get into the soybean and soy broth) and the Scallop entree was just ok.
Desert was pretty awesome - the Chocolate Club Sandwich with Pineapple Fries was the bomb as well as the assorted Creme Brulee's!
Server was excellent in wine choices - really spent the time to recommend based on our tastes and not just high prices."}
{"text":"Not worth the money anymore.

l'Épicier has slipped for certain since my last visit 5 years ago and we went to some much better restaurants including: Le Club Chasse et Peche, Bocata and Au Pied de Cochon.

I came to Montreal for a few days from NYC and was excited to eat again at l'Épicier for the second time (the last time was ~5 years ago).

We paid up for the extensive tasting menu after tasting an amazing goat cheese macaroon.  Unfortunately, that was the best item on the menu.  The rest of the food ranged from decent (the foie gras and Cobia Crudo) to the absolutely inedible scoop of cheese that they tried to pass off as a cheese plate.

The service was fast and friendly, but just could not make up for the weakness of the food."}
{"text":"Excellent position in older Montreal. Pleasant design in addition to great program. Your cooking will be first, in addition to scrumptious. Acquired top notch seafood plate all around a new bouillabaisse design (traditional seafood soup from Provence), then the good Pannacota, local orange berries, mango sorbet wasteland. Vino was a great Chenin Blanc through the Loire Vly. Good quality foodstuff, sensible although not inexpensive cost, entire I'd recommend this kind of position if you want adventurous tasty food, with a French touch."}
{"text":"We got a reservation, same day,  for 9:30PM on a Saturday night during the Grande Prix. Rather amazing considering how packed the entire city is.

The food wasn't as good as I had hoped for after reading the reviews here (maybe 4 stars out of 5) but the service was really quite attentive while not being obtrusive. Our waiter was fabulous and took the time to explain the dishes, the preparation, and even ensured that I didn't order anything that contained wheat as I am allergic. 

I started with the asparagus first course. It was quite bland and very small - I wouldn't order it again. I worried that my main course might not be enough to sate my appetite. My dining companion had a half order of the gnocchi to start with and he said it was fabulous. It was served with a mascarpone sauce, morels, and a balsamic reduction. I wished I could have had some but there was some flour in the preparation. He was in love and said he would give it 7.5 out of 10 stars. 

For my main course, I had the duck breast with a cauliflower puree and \"warm potato salad\". The duck portion was quite large but not very tender (probably as it was served medium rare). It was tasty but the sauce that accompanied it was not stellar. I also didn't feel that the cauliflower puree was a good match to the duck flavor. It was sprayed with a vinegar at the table that made it a bit too tart/sour. I didn't understand where the \"warm potato salad\" was though - there were these tiny little friend potato chips stuck into the puree, and small balls of potato with each mound of puree - the balls were a bit undercooked - was this the warm potato salad? I would give this a 3 out of 5. While good (or was I just really hungry due to the small first course?) it needs some work to be truly stellar.

My companion had the salmon (I think with a mustard sauce) and it looked quite wonderful. Good sized portion. He said it was very good.

I was quite full after the large duck portion (I'd like to see what duck that they took that breast off of - it was huge! - some sort of monster sized duck!). I ordered a few macaroons for dessert - they were amazingly light and airy, the fillings put inside of the two halves right before serving. Uber fresh. They have quite a few flavors to choose from which is nothing short of amazing - how do they find the time to make these, i wondered. The couple adjacent to us ordered the creme brulee assortment for their dessert and it looked fabulous. The dessert menu had a few things that were immediately understandable, but a few of the items (\"dessert salad\"?) were so \"modern\" that I just wasn't interested. 

A few things they need: 
- A wine menu by the glass that you can read from your table
- A dessert drink menu to accompany the dessert menu
- Nicer bathrooms (or someone to attend to them during the evening). The womens' toilette had towels thrown all over the counter and the floor was  wet

I would definitely come here again. It's a very nice dining experience. It just needs a bit of help with a few of the menu items to knock my socks off."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The location is excellent - right on Rue St. Paul in the heart of Old Montreal. The food was outstanding. I had the halibut and my wife had the quail. Both of us agreed it was one of the best meals we had while in Canada."}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times across the last 5 years and always enjoy the food, ambiance, service, setting.  It's a wonderful place with a creative seasonal menu."}
{"text":"Amazing meal. Everything looked like a work of art and tasted even better. I had the steak tartar, best I've had yet and I've tried a lot... And sea bass was gorgeous and tasty. And a yummy vanilla macaroon. Great atmosphere and great service!"}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance and great food! Went for lunch and they offered the set menu. Ordered the four grad... Delicious. I would go back."}
{"text":"This is a special occasion restaurant and is really a 4.5, but I don't know how to do that, so 4 it is as I am not a fan of grade inflation. This restaurant is wonderfully located on a corner in Old Town Montreal. As you will note from other reviews, it is pricey, particularly the alcohol.  Glasses of wine appear heavily regulated in Montreal, so if you think you'll get an American style pour of 6 or more ounces in a big glass, think again. All the glasses are strictly limited to 4 ounces, and this seems true everywhere. But, that's the half star mark-off and probably not their fault. The prices are, though.

Our server, Thomas, was excellent, and was not afraid to make recommendations. We started with the pan seared foie gras which was not on the menu but still available. My wife, the foie gras Queen, ordered a second later in the meal. Excellent if you like foie gras. The steak tartar was fabulous and imaginatively presented and served with a beet sauce which went very well with it. We also had the escargots, which was awesome as well. If you get the impression you could make a meal just out of starters, you are right.

On to the main courses, which are decidedly less French and more generally continental. But excellent nonetheless. At Thomas's recommendation, I had a special steak that is not in the online menu. I cannot remember the cut, but it was not the beef tenderloin. I do remember it was fabulous and the wine he recommended went very well with it. 

We skipped dessert here, although we understand from other reviews they are great. We took a walk down the street to get a chocolate chip soufflé nearby at Restaurant Bonaparte. I can recommend it as well, but should probably save that for a different review."}
{"text":"Went with 3 other people two of which are gluten dairy free. I had the porcetta which was excellent as were the oysters and cod. The shrimp with endive was disappointing. For dessert we had the creme brûlée sampler and sorbet sampler. While the sorbets were excellent the different creme brûlée flavored did not work for me especially not the saffron one. 
Service was excellent and very accommodating. 
Would go back and recommend."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in old Montreal.  Went for dinner based on a recommendation of a local. Thoroughly enjoyed the menu selection, wine list, quality of food, service and ambiance.  When it came to my food sensitivities, the chef made accommodations that were over and above most chefs/restaurants.  Entirely enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Ate there a couple months ago and am just getting around to writing a review. The appetizer I had at Chez L'epicier was the best course I have ever had in my entire life. I had the Steak Tartare on some sort of Asian Fried Leaf thing. I eat very quickly... too quickly in most instances... I hadn't finished my appetizer of Steak Tartare by the time some people had finished their main course... I never wanted it to end. I have never eaten so slowly and enjoyed a course more in my life. The rest of the meal was excellent but not even worth reporting on compared to the appetizer. I am hoping Laurent Godbout opens a restaurant down in DC."}
{"text":"Fantastic dinner, great setting, the best meal I had in Montreal. The food is presented in an upscale manner and tastes as good as it looks."}
{"text":"Our second visit here and this place will definitely be a prominent fixture in our trips to Montreal.  What I love about the food is that it doesn't try to get too experimental for the sake of being cool but still exhibits creativity, competency and most of all FLAVOR... 

Let me tell you about my Bouillabaisse.  It is a dish I love to order but is usually a bit heavier than I like in the end.  This version was more or less deconstructed with outrageously well prepared seafood sitting in a thin layer of the richest most flavorful broth I have every tasted.  

My other half had a truffle gnocchi which makes you sit up an take notice of the difference between truffles and truffle oil.  This was the real-deal and was unusual in that the pieces were very small and delightfully light.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed cocktails and banter with the bar-tender which is just the way we like our upscale dining experiences.

The sample of four creme brulee was a perfect end to the evening."}
{"text":"Some restaurants are all about taste and presentation is an after thought. 
Some restaurants are all about showing off visually at the expense of flavor.  
L'epicier has it all.  The food is not only artful in presentation, but delivers memorable, still-thinking-about-it-a-week-later tastes.  
Even the butter (fois gras/paprika) stood out.  
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Argh, what a disappointment.  Having read through the list of raving reviews and listening to the concierge's recommendations, I thought that this would be the killer place to spend our last evening in Montreal.  Instead, it killed the good vibe!  

Ok, so we sat down ok and had a nice introduction to the restaurant.  Staff was pleasant enough.  A bit disengaged but not to a degree that was unbearable.  I started with a lovely butternut squash bisque.  That was quite good.  The wife had a mesculun salad that had a grotesque, sloppy presentation (a large bunch of leaves bound together in a completely inconvenient mass too difficult to truly address) ... That had to be sent back.  She had a mushroom risotto that was quite nice.  I had a veal dish that was forgettable, to be honest.  She had a 'Pinot noir' that was, at best, a top choice at Olive Garden.  I had a cab that, without exaggeration, smelled like hard boiled eggs. To top if off, something caught fire in the kitchen, so service came to a stan still for the entire place.  The entire restaurant had a haze to it.  No apologies from management for the smell or for the fact that dinner took two hours."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and wine list. Contemporary French-style restaurant with exquisite taste combinations. If you're looking for a fine dining experience with eclectic flavors and a comfortable vibe, this is THE place to eat in Vieux Montreal. (Dress ranges from smart casual to dressy.)"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Sunday evening with some friends. We all had the tasting menu. Everything was delicious, and nicely prepared. We started with the gazpacho soup. It was elegant, but not my favourite. The scallops were cooked to perfection and dotted with different sauces. My favourite was the foie gras. I normally do not like it, but this had a nice flavour. Although expensive, it was a good value. Also of note, when getting the tasting menu, expect to spend at least 2 hours. If you have somewhere to go, then try the a-la-carte menu. I do not think you can take the rest in a doggie bag and catch the game."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed.  
The sea bass was brought to the table uncooked. When this was pointed out to the wait person, it was replaced. But it took more than fifteen minutes, by which time, my wife had finished her meal. We were charged in full with no adjustment.
Our server was very good."}
{"text":"We stumbled into this place by accident (and I'd say we lucked out) while wandering in Old Montreal this weekend.  

We were looking for a dessert spot, and despite our being somewhat underdressed, without a reservation, they welcomed us to sit at the bar for dessert.  We had the chocolate club sandwich (served with a melon salad and some amazing \"pineapple fries\"), and the hazelnut-praline and chocolate mille-feuille, caramel with salt butter glaze and another on with lemon .  Both were excellent, and the bartender was quite friendly as well.  

Our only complaint is with the fake candlelight effect that they have going on with the bar lighting.  It worked for the insets behind the bar, but the flickers in the overhead track lighting were a bit distracting. 

The dinner menu looks to be pricy, but if the desserts were any indication, it's probably worth a splurge!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Chez L'epicier on our last trip to Montreal. The food is great. The service was good. I had the duck. We had some excellent fois gras here, but it was such a small amount, we wanted more!"}
{"text":"My first night in Montreal I spent at Chez L'epicer. The service was wonderful. It was about 10:30pm and they didn't hesitate to seat us. We decided to order the seven course meal with wine pairing. I usually don't order set meals but thought why not try something different. It offered a full tasting of almost the entire menu.
1.) Hot broth with lemongrass and tomato, kampachi fish, yuze meringue and kumquat carpaccio.
2.) Frog legs, grilled eggplant, watercress puree with butter, garlic and parsley cromesquis.
3.) Sweetbreads, glazed ginger, mushroom risotto. (The winner)
4.) Pressed foie gras from Elysee Farm, compressed apple compost, beet roll-up with cider vinegar and syrup, micro-amaranth, dill and cinamon crumble.
5.) Boileau venison cooked at 54 degrees, mini stuffed cabbage, creamy sweet potatoes, cinnamon foam.
6.) Cheese puff, apple laque
7.) Greek yogurt sphere with pistachio powder, coriander and basil lichen, pistachio crumble.

Seven different wines served with each dish.I'm not a wine expert at all but each wine seemed to enhance the taste of the food. Had a great meal. I can't tell you how pleasant the service was. Friendly and efficient to the max."}
{"text":"Lovely location and ambience.  Good experience overall on a recent business dinner.  Pros: surprisingly good Quebec wine.  Cons:  disappointed with the duck entree.  Would return (but avoid the duck!)"}
{"text":"We ate here in December of last year and I can't recall exactly what we ate. I do recall that the food was super tasty and very well prepared. The restaurant is pretty stylish, but laid back and not too pretentious. When we ate, it was mostly a business crowd, but as we were enjoying a romantic evening meal they let us sit at the other side, near the bar. We were totally alone, and had a great time. I think I drunk too much...."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service not so much. Time between 1st and 2nd course was substantial."}
{"text":"OMG... Un conseil d'une amie m'a apporté à ce restaurant. Vous devez essayer cette merveille. Un chef dont le nom est connu mais que je n'avait pas eu la chance encore d'en essayer leur uvres...wow et les desserts accotent facilement ceux des 400 Coups. Bravo et bravo au service"}
{"text":"I am so glad I dined at Chez L'epicier during my stay in Montreal, it really solidified the message that Montreal is one of the top cities in Canada for some of the best food you will ever taste!

The ambiance alone in this place is astounding. Old brick walls, a cozy and candlelit atmosphere ... Chez L'epicier seems to achieve a romantic old-world feel so easily. The wait times for seeing your order (as well as your server) are a bit long, but I hear that is pretty standard for Montreal.

The gnocchi was packed with a surprisingly strong flavour. I'm still not entirely sure if I enjoyed it entirely but I do remember it made quite the impact on my tastebuds! Not in a bad way, but I distinctly remember thinking the taste was very different from other gnocchi I've had. Dessert was a plate of delicate madelienes with scoops of fresh sorbet, absolutely delicious. The presentation for each dish was also impeccable. My fellow dining companions ordered the creme brulee and deep fried mars bar, both receiving stellar reviews as well.

We loved this place so much we came back the next night for dessert but they were closed. I will definitely be back here if I'm ever in Montreal again. Thanks for the wonderful and delicious memories, Chez L'epicier!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal!
We didn't have reservations but I called the day we wished to visit - the restaurant was fully booked but the gentleman on the phone said if we didn't mind sitting at the bar he promised it would be just as fun.

My fiancé and I had no problem with that, we always feel we get more attentive service at the bar in an upscale restaurant and the turnover isn't that high so we could just relax.

We started with cocktails - I had a caesar with the best maple glazed bacon I've ever had. My fiancé had a classic scotch - both were tasty.

A complimentary macaroon filled with mulled olives and creamed goat cheese arrived in front of us, I found the savoury macaroon delicious - my fiancé not so much.

I couldn't decide on what to eat, many of the times we are at home, in Toronto and I cannot decide I just allow our server to choose and surprise me - I didn't feel as comfortable here as the menu, while beautiful, didn't explain the ingredients the same way our server did.

I settled on the seas scallops with corn and Lima beans. The most fantastic scallops! 

My fiancé had the chefs special, sea bream with wild mushrooms on the side. Also fantastic!

We were so stuffed we had to pass on dessert - but the menu looked liked they covered off something for everyone.

Wonderful evening that I would suggest making a reservation for if you wish to have a table."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a gourmet restaurant in Montreal, go to Chez L'Epicier. We had an outstanding dinner there on December 30, 2017 complemented by outstanding service.  They also provide expert wine paring if you wish."}
{"text":"OMG THEIR FOIE GRAS IS THE BEST!!!!!! some places can't make it right and has that fishy or stinky smell but this place sure does know their food!!!!!

I got their special for the night...it was canard and foie gras with potatoe and a canard cake!!! 

this place is good and reasonable!!! must try if you are visiting!!!"}
{"text":"Plats raffinés, service impecable

Pour l'entrée, j'ai pris un filet de truite fumé doucement à chaud, réduction d'érable et miso, pommes de terre ratte à l'échalote, mousse de vinaigre d'érable, pour le repas principal: macreuse de buf laquée à l'orange et olives, brandade d'oignons au beurre de romarin, jus réduit au Cointreau. J'ai royalement bavé pour la brandade d'oignons.

Pour le dessert, brownies en tempura, crème au yogourt grec, gelée de chocolat blanc

Dans l'ensemble, un goût subtil, savants mélanges, une belle surprise"}
{"text":"Location: St. Paul East in the old port. The closest subway is Champ-de-Mars and it's less than a ten-minute walk. Street parking is available though sparse, and there's a lot not too far from the restaurant, but I think the going rate is $15.

The place: Gorgeous! Very classy and cozy, with high ceilings and windows facing out onto St. Paul (we totally lucked out with our table).The restaurant isn't huge by any means, but it's spacious and you don't feel claustrophobic when it's a full house. 

The food: We went for MTL à Table so the menu was fixed. Now, let's discuss how the good folk at Chez L'Épicier thought it would be nice to start us off with a complimentary maple syrup cocktail (refreshing!) and some lovely amuses-bouches (olive + goat cheese macarons = HELLO chef!). I went to three restaurants during MTL à Table and none of them did this so I thought it was a nice touch. 

To start, I had the squash velouté (homemade sour cream, onions, squash seed, parsley juice and brown butter vinaigrette) - it was divine. The velouté was silky, thick and creamy, and meshed perfectly with the other ingredients. Loved this! My friend had the smoked trout filet (with miso and maple reduction, shallot fingerling potatoes and a maple vinegar mousse). She really enjoyed her dish as well. 

For the main, I went with the sea bass filet, crusted with herb polenta, lobster juice bouillabaisse, served with glazed vegetables + water butter. The fish was fresh, and the crust was light - it wasn't heavy or oily at all. The broth was really flavourful, and the vegetables were cooked to perfection. Fantastic dish! My friend had the macreuse and said it was delicious as well.

For dessert, I had the tempura brownie with Greek yogurt cream/ white chocolate jelly. I'm pretty selective when it comes to brownies because so few people get it right - I mean, if it's not decadently chocolatey, then it's not a brownie, as far as I'm concerned. On this point, L'Épicier did not disappoint. The brownie was the perfect level of chocolatey without being overbearingly sweet or rich, and the tempura was simply a thin coat of batter, making this dessert relatively light (surprising, right?). The cream/ jelly were the perfect accompaniment and I thoroughly enjoyed this dessert, even though my belly was full from the starter + main! 

Service: Very good. The staff were present and ensured that the menu + additional options were explained to us, they kept our water glasses full, and they made zero fuss when my friend let them know that she has Celiac's disease. It sounded like the chef had taken this into consideration when preparing the menu because no substitutes were necessary.  Each dish was introduced to us with an explanation of what it was, and the ingredients that were used. Top notch. 

Price point: The fixed menu was $39 + tax, and you really can't beat that price considering the exceptional quality of these dishes + the service received. 

Laurent Godbout has a great thing going here - I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I know that it is hard to go wrong finding a good restaurant in Montreal, but some places are just better than others.

A co-worker, who lives in Montreal, took me here on a Tuesday night.  He told me that we would likely never get in on a weekend night.  Based on the food, I can see why.

The location is in Old Montreal, which can have touristy places than border on bad food.  The decor is also not quite as fancy as the four $$$$ that Yelp lists this place.  

In fact, I would not call this a $$$$ place .  The menu changes quite a bit, but there were plenty of meals under $40.

Service was helpful and attentive.  Recommendations on wine, entrees and dessert were excellent:
-Wine list is good... heavy on French and European - with lots of price points covered.
-I had a simple mescalin salad with dressing.  Other than the fact that it was enough for two, it was a great start to the meal.
-My dining companion had the tartar mixed with beets.  He said the beets gave it an interesting flavor and texture.
-I had the scallops.  Presentation was beautiful and the various textures/flavors were to die for.
-Finally, we shared Chocolate Bavarois.  There has never been a better combination of cocoa!

The last point I would like to make on this excellent establishment is that the chef must like foie gras.  I counted no less than 6 menu items that contained it.  The amuse bouche had it.  My scallops were flavored with it.  At the beginning of the meal, we remarked that we thought the butter was flavored with it (it isn't - it was simply butter with olives in it).  This chef really knows how to cook!"}
{"text":"L'Épicier translates into grocer in English.  Although you won't find aisles of fresh produce or a meat counter here, you will find walls adorned with various oils, jarred vegetables, and condiments available for sale.

I've often heard people say that you should pick a wife who knows how to pick good produce, because its a sure sign that she will know how to cook good food.  Well, Chef Godbout is no woman, but he sure knows good food.  Not only that, he has an eye for perfection and a passion to present his food beautifully.  As I plunged my fork into the artfully crafted dishes that were put forth at the table, I couldn't help but feel like I was desecrating Michaelangelo's Statue of David - but I was too hungry to abstain and the food looked very inviting.

Chez L'Épicier is located in Old Montréal, directly across from the Marché Bonsecours on the same strip that is home to other much raved about restaurants such as Chuck Hughes' Le Bremner.  What caught my eye about this restaurant were the festive decorations, and big windows.  I always love a restaurant that has a view of the street, let alone the cobblestoned paths of Montréal.

One thing I've learned about dining in Montréal, is that if you want good food, you better make sure you have a reservation!  We were promptly seated and our server let us know about their feature wines and daily specials.

Shortly after, she reappeared and made wine pairing suggestions for William T.  I ended up settling on a glass of martini while my dining companion had a glass of red wine.

While we were waiting, we were brought a complimentary amuse bouche presented on a spoon.  It was composed of a cauliflower panna cotta with gravlax, parsley, garlic and chives.  The herb mixture looked very much like a pesto.

The complimentary bread came with 2 butters, your usual plain butter and a honey mustard butter that was simply irresistible.To start we ordered the lobster bisque which is made with a cognac sabayon and tarragon foam.  The lobster bisque had a full-bodied and bold lobster flavour to it, unlike others I've had where all you can taste is a roux made entirely of butter and flour.  The best way I can describe the flavour is as if the lobster innards and shells were liquified to make this savoury soup. 

We also ordered the suckling pig fondant with mustard and truffled Yukon Gold velouté.  The pork came with a crispy pancake, which still has me guessing as to what it is made of.  The potato velouté was velvety smooth and the pig fondant was pillow-y soft.  The velouté really made the dish.  Although I think I would've used a sturdier green than scallions so that it can maintain its form a little better instead of collapsing over the fondant. 

For mains I ordered the osso bucco with a side order of pan-seared foie gras.  The osso bucco was surrounded by a mini-garden of onions that were piped with a vanilla-carrot espuma (aka foam), and an apricot-arugula polenta.  The osso bucco was not as tender as I would've liked, but melted off the bone.  The vanilla-carrot espuma were very tasty and visually appealing and the polenta was tasty.  The sweetness from the polenta and espuma complimented a salty osso bucco very well.  The foie was also very savory... Like eating liquid butter. Yummy!

William T. opted for the Alberta beef filet mignon served with a potato dauphinois and légumes.  I couldn't stop eating the scalloped-potato meat loaf, as it was creamy like a scalloped potato should be, but infused with beef flavour.  This made it hard for us to enjoy our vegetables after!

Unfortunately, we had a show to catch at the Place des Arts, so we didn't have time to order dessert.

Verdict:

Chez L'Épicier is not a happening restaurant where all the hip and trendy hang out, but it is a place to appreciate savory food, and carefully executed plating.  Its like going to an art gallery opening because you expect tasty hors d'oeuvres and wine to be served, but you are also there to see the masterpieces on display.  There might not be any Monets at Chez L'Épicier, but their dishes truly are a work of art."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, excellent service. Tables are a bit small though. Strongly recommended."}
{"text":"Chez L'epicier has a classy decor and menu, but I find the food to be artsy to the point of not really being food anymore. If you want to look at the food and not eat it you will really like this place.

The price structure is staggered so you can spend anywhere from $20 to $80 on your entree depending how fancy you want to get. The seven-course tasting menu is at the top of the tree. One problem with the tasting menu is that if others in your party are getting single-dish entrees they will be waiting around when you are on the various courses.

The wine list is phenomenal. You want to spend $2000 on wine? You came to the right place. Many of the wines are elite French vintages rarely seen outside of Europe. The lower end wines are around $100 a bottle and there are numerous grand cru options at around $400-$500. Only bottles are offered, no glasses of wine.

I liked the laid back elegance of decor with a touch of rusticism. It is the perfect fit for feel of Montreal. They have shelves where you can buy various sauces and condiments in the foyer area.

The real problem with the restaurant is that the chef is an artist, not a cook. For example, when I got the tasting menu the final (seventh) course was a piece of lamb about the size of my thumb perched on top of a log cabin tower of vegetables I did not recognize. Over this aedifice was poured a semi-sweet chocolate sauce. The foundation of the quixotic structure was a bed of fluffed potatoes embued with a sauce of some sort. In general, every dish had to be explained by the server so you would know what it was.

I don't really fault the restaurant for doing this kind of preparation, because unfortunately the trend in Quebec now is \"avante-garde\" creations which emphasize visual appearance. Hopefully this fad will go away soon. I mean, for the love of god, I go to museums if I want to look at art, and I go to restaurants when I want to eat."}
{"text":"If I could give 3 and half I would.
The amuse bouche was charming, and vegetarian/gf tagliatelle Alfredo with salsify \"noodles\" was quite good and a fun texture. 
It's a very classy atmosphere and the big windows on the corner have a great view of the action on the street. 


We came back another night and the dessert was not nearly as impressive.
Both the presentation and the execution of the desserts was more like 2.5 stars if I had to give a separate review. 

The creme brûlées where all very watery and not custard like at all, plus they were terribly over-burnt on top. 

With the exception of a tasty and surprisingly not at all bitter turnip sorbet , none of  sorbets were interesting, special, or executed exceptionally well. 

Go here, but don't get dessert."}
{"text":"This is the Best French dining experience I've had hands down. Fine dinning with a really cool  rugged, casual and vintage atmosphere...
The tasting menu is a perfect blend, very unique and artistic both visually and in taste.
All of the unique dishes had a lot of delightfully surprising components. Perfect and
Beautiful blend! Who would have ever thought a tomato sorbet would ever go so well
with a cheese based dessert...Lastly,but definitely not least, the service was beyond amazing."}

J'hésite toujours à manger dans ce genre de restaurant car il n'y a rien de plus frustrant que de vider son porte-feuille pour une expérience très bof. Ce n'est définitivement pas le cas ici.
J'ai adoré l'ambiance calme, mais pas trop guindée, et que dire de la nourriture. J'ignore si les plats qui nous ont été servis se retrouvent sur le menu habituel, mais l'expérience autant gustative que visuelle était parfaite."}
{"text":"I like Chez L'Epicier and it is a nice place to go for tasty food. Cute presentation of food on the dish too. Nice atmosphere. 

Great place to order lots of dishes and eat. Portions are small so order a lot if you are hungry. It is best if you sample just about everything on the menu to get a sense of the full range of flavors here. Oh yes, once they had a Peach Mojito that was very tasty."}
{"text":"Little lady at hotel recommended this place.  Very, very good.  Yeah, real good. Yeaaaaaaahhhhh....

Walked in No Reservation.  Sat at the bar.

Immediately received impeccable service.  They were bowing and scraping all over the place.  We're off to a good start.

Couple nice local beers on tap, high quality.  Wine list to make your head-spin.

I started off with the oysters (raw) from PEI.  They were good but did not blow my doors off.  Honestly the oysters in Maine are better.  Best in the country IMO.  Nova Scotia has really good oysters too.  I think PEI is very capable of having fantastic oysters, but the way they were served - they were almost warm.  I like my oysters in a bed of ice.

Main course I had the scallops which were excellent.  Other thangs on the menu looked excellent also.

It is a real nice atmosphere, with great service, all that stuff.  

Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"First meal in Montreal. Very welcoming services. The starter macaroons are delightful. The soup and 1st entree are fairly good. However I took a bit long for the main course to be finally served. Maybe it's just a layback style thing here. Overall, my experience are satisfying."}
{"text":"We came as a group of 6 for Mtl @ Table for $41 pp. Menu choices were limited but enough to please anybody. I chose as an entree a veal carpaccio with an eggplant \"caviar\" on lettuce. Very good, nice blend of flavours, but nothing stood out.  The main dish was Arctic Char with a potato Mille-feuille. Beautiful presentation and the fish was perfectly cooked. The desert was a beautiful jellied apple with mousse and real apple inside. The desert was the highlight of the night for me.  Everybody enjoyed their meal. Our waiter was a little intense, but still gave good service and recommended some great wines to accompany our meals. The setting in old Montreal is perfect with a view on Marché Bonsecours.  I'm glad we came as part of a special priced night because I'm not sure I would have paid more for a similar meal any other night."}
{"text":"came with friends for a Canada day dinner... great location in old MTL! had the tartar, escargot/shrimp mix and cerviche to start... tartar was decent, the ceviche was a little too coconutty for my liking but the escargot was excellent!!! tried the duck and the halibut for mains... both very good too! deserts were good but nothing crazy... only thing that was a little annoying was the slow service due to a large boisterous group adjacent to us... and that's always been my biggest pet peeve..."}
{"text":"Not bad at all but somewhat overrated based on my personal experience there. $63 seemed excessive for 3 kir royals that our party ordered
Apps were fair. The ceviche seemed likely mostly veggies and little tuna. 

Entrees were good but lacked flair. 
Male server pleasant but lacking any warmth or enthusiasm. 
Female who brought our dishes and described the preparations was warm,pleasant, and informative. 

Nothing wrong with this meal but it was by far our most expensive in Montreal and it really was not memorable in any way."}
{"text":"Very pleased for Montreal en Lumiere

It was a perfectly pleasant meal, I ordered the wine pairing and found the selections to complement the food really great.  It was our first visit and we were very happy with our choice. Parking right out front was easy.  It is a top restaurant here in the Old Montreal and is as I would expect.  The food is turned out to a high standard, well executed, served in a timely manner, excellent judicious service.  Well-paced meal.   I would return.  The night that we visited 2/25 (Tuesday) we had guest chef Luc Vaillancourt and not Laurent Godbout."}
{"text":"The best dinner my wife have had in several years. Fresh ingredients mixed in imaginative ways and cooked to perfection. Careful thought was put into every aspect of their business: the tableware was unique and elegant; we especially loved the heavy cast-iron individual teapots. Even the sink in the bathroom was beautiful: the water flows over a stone slab that you place your hands under. For appetizers I had the almond gazpacho (wonderful) and my wife had fresh tomatoes in olive oil served on top of goat (?) cheese and with exquisite fried kalamata olives. For the main course she had the lobster served de-shelled with a lobster bisque topping and lying on top of a spring roll stuffed with mushrooms. I had the sea bass served with fresh vegetables, a creamy dill sauce and I believe risotto. For desert I had the ice cream/sorbet sampler (vanilla, coffee, pineapple, tangerine, and pink grapefruit) and my wife had the creme brulee sampler (ginger, chocolate, mint, and lime). Even my anise tea was delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Five stars because try as I may I can't find anything wrong with the experience we had! 

Romantic and rustic with undeniable class, exposed brick and dim lighting made for a wistful meal as we sat and watched the snow fall outside the window sharing our grand marnier and dirty martinis. 

The martinis were perfectly crafted by someone who is obviously a skilled mixologist...balanced and smooth...not too sweet, not too dirty. 

Our lovely lady server was prompt, courteous, non-intrusive, sweet and  knowledgeable which made the experience that much more enjoyable.  

We ordered the squash soup to start and the scallop ceviche.  The hubby ordered the filet and I, the dory.  

Began with a palate pleaser of tiny bite sized macarons sitting on top of goat cheese.  I'm not doing it justice by trying to explain it in detail here so I won't even try, but I will say that being a macaron connesieur, it was perfectly chewy with an enticing balance of sweet and savory.  Well done. First impression of the meal ahead? Genius.  

The soup was served next in two parts. The bowl arrived like a piece of abstract artwork, properly explained and then came the soup.  Poured right in, mixed with the contents remaining and tasted phenomenal.  The scallop ceviche is among the best I've ever had and the pairing of scallop with pear is once again, genius and beautiful.  

The mains seemed to have a visual color effect of red and green.  The filet was highlighted by a beet purée and the dory was complemented by one brussel sprout and what seemed to be an Asian bakchoy.  I felt that the dory dish was meant to be deliciously confusing.  Obviously a French dish but with moments of Asian flare.  

Ordered 4 macarons for dessert: coco vanilla, chocolate, pistachio and banana split.  Candle on top for the birthday girl & complimentary marshmallows with a tiny do it yourself burner so you can s'mores away right at your table. What a touch.  

The meal was smartly anchored between thoughtfulness...little moments that introduced the experience and closed the deal with an inexpensive but very sweet touch. 

Coffee and a complimentary call to assist with a cab made the evening comfortably seamless.

Thank you chez lepicier for a memorable birthday!"}
{"text":"On a visit to Montreal, my wife and I had an amazing time here. The food was sublime, and the presentation was artful and playful. The service was fantastic as well. This is a great place for a celebration."}
{"text":"Chez L'épicier is a restaurant by Chef Laurent Godbout and offers both a tasting and an a la carte menu.  The hubs and I came here for dinner, and we tried the following: Clam Chowder with fumet and purple potatoes confit with clover honey (this wasn't as thick and creamy as I thought it would be, but the taste of it was light and foamy; the purple potatoes were way too sweet, and did not add well to the overall soup, as they were sickly covered with the honey); the Scallops Sashimi with celeriac, reduced cream, and plum butter (we were not fans of this dish at all, as the scallops were bland and lukewarm, and the taste was a combination of acidic, grainy (from the plum butter), and had an unappetizing taste to it); the Homemade Pasta that was miso-flavored in a roasted vegetable broth, filled with Chinese artichoke and herbs (the buccatini was cooked perfectly al dente, but the dish was way too salty (even for me) - I could not finish this after a bite, as each pasta and the veggies were soaked and coated with salt crystals); and, the Beef Tenderloin with vinegar confit onion puree, wild mushrooms, and basil-flavored onions (the beef tenderloin itself was fine, but the star of this dish were the wild mushrooms - they had a lovely grilled savory taste to them).  For dessert, I had heard about their macarons, especially the strawberry-flavored ones - however, I was really disappointed that they did not have that flavor available T____T  Instead, I tried the lemon & thyme (which was more lemon, rather than any subtle hint of thyme), and the raspberry (which was just too sweet and had a dollop of sugary raspberry jam within).  We also tried a layered sliced carrot napoloen, which was pretty interesting, as it played off the sweetness from the glazed carrots.  For a drink, we tried a lemonade concoction that was made with strawberry puree, ginger ale, and yuzu - this was super refreshing and delicious!  Service was super friendly and nice - Mr. Julian, Mr. Thiebault, and Mr. Philippe were all so welcoming and attentive; I liked the exposed brick walls within the restaurant and we sat by the window, which was nice to watch the passerbyers (however, there is construction going on, so there isn't much to see :P  I'm glad I was able to check this restaurant out, but the food was just severely disappointing!

{"text":"Very good food 
Duck and steak tartar is awesome
Deserts was also good
Service was fast and accurate 
Nice vine selection and food presentation"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. I love it for the décor, the chef, the servers... It was my first time there and it was my friend Holly's birthday and we got to sit by the window next to their various containers of salt. I loved the chalkboards, the plants, the brick, the displays. I loved how unpretentious it looked.

It wasn't too loud of ambience, but didn't make you feel like talking would echo throughout and be embarassing. The food was suprising, and unexpectedly amazing and I will tell you why. 

My friend Holly is a vegetarian, and the dish she chose was about Onions. All about onions, and in fact had not much more than onions. So when her plate arrived and it was onions done in about 12 different ways, we were kinda shocked. It was filling, and it was so different in experience. We also started off with a cheese tarte and almost fought for the crumbs. I had the chicken sous-vide and it was juicy, tender, and tasty. 

We could have stopped there, but decided to revel in food, so we ordered dessert: a delicious dessert of the most memorable pistachio gelato, and mille feuille, we had ever had the chance to try. We also got a macaron, but we did only because we've never tried it before, and neither of us understand the craze for them.  

Afterwards the chef came and introduced himself and ask about our meal. Our server and the chef were very courteous and pleasant.

I'd come back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  My wife and I were walking around Old Montreal and we noticed two restaurants, Version and Chez L'Epicier.  After hitting the web on my phone we realized that they were both owned by Laurent Godbout.  So when we got back to our hotel, we asked the concierge about both of them.  She responded that Chez L'Epicier is more traditional French so we went with that one.  

When we got there our table was not ready so we had a drink at the bar.  Once our table was ready we ordered a glass of champagne and got down to business.  My wife ordered the \"Homemade smoked salmon, gribiche sauce with lobster oil, fennel waffle and thickened vodka and black pepper cream\".  I must say that this might be once of the best appetizers I have ever eaten.  It was simply amazing.  I ordered the \"White asparagus velvety soup,  porcini and truffle oil,
mushroom mousse, shallot chips\".  The soup was also amazing with the mushroom mousse out of this world.  For our main course my wife got the vegetarian option since she didn't want to have salmon for her appetizer as well as her main.  So she ordered the \"Confit tomatoes arancini, cepes mushrooms purée, boiler onions gratin,  gyromithe mushrooms.  Now, last year we were strict vegetarians for a whole year and I don't think we can say that we had one meal that tasted as good as this one.  The risotto was fried into a cake and accompanied by some great tasting vegetables.  I on the other hand ordered the lobster (didn't have on the menu so I can't post actual description).  This was probably the best lobster I have ever had.  The tail was infused with some injection of wonderful goodness and then it was accompanied by two claws with each one having a poached quail egg on top.  Under each claw there was a potato of some sort that was to die for.  For dessert we split the \"Medley of crèmes brûlées\".  There was Pistachio, Coffee, Honey, and Chocolate flavors.  

Now when you walk into the restaurant you will see almost a little store.  There are amazing little gourmet items that you can purchase.  For instance, you can get truffle oils or even homemade marshmallows.  But the one thing that caught my eye was Laurent Godbout's cook book.  So after dinner I asked our waiter if Chef Godbout was actually there that evening which he was and I asked him if I could get the cook book signed.  So after a few minutes the waiter came back to my table, asked me my name and was off again.  A minute later he came back from the kitchen with the cook book autographed by Laurent Godbout.  It was a great ending to a great evening with my wife out in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"We had a pre-fixe menu because it was a large group. Their amuse bouchée was excellent. Delicately rendered egg rolls for appetizer, guinea fowl entree (was OK) and cake for dessert. 
We had some 2005 French wine which was delicious."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give 4 1/2 stars.  We've been there twice and it seemed so close to the perfect experience.  The food is outstanding.  The ambiance upstairs is warm and cosmopolitan, downstairs is meh. Crème brûlée is exceptional."}
{"text":"Chez L'épicier is one of my favourite restaurant in Montreal. Very creative french menu with great ingredients. Went their 3 times and their menu was different every time. Their tasting menu is very worth it, comes with the book from the chef, each of us got one. The most memorable dish was the soup with 3 different temperature! Loved it."}
{"text":"The food was divine.  I took away one star for the attitude.  We didn't have a reservation so we inquired as to availability on a lark as we walked by and were intrigued by the menu. Acting as though it were a hardship, the hostess grudgingly seated us at the (empty) bar.  When we left, there were still empty tables.  The service we got from the bartender herself was just fine."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant.  My sister and I saw this place during the day and decided to go at night.  We looked up reviews and it seemed great.  My sister is a pastry chef and loves French food, so it was a good choice.  We got the halibut and the filet mignon.  Both were delicious as was my pre-main course salad.  Dessert is always the tell-tale sign of whether we like a restaurant and we were fairly pleased.
Favorite: Caramelized nuts iced soufflé with Frangelico, grilled pineapple, mango-coconut sauce, fennel madeleine.  It didn't even need the madeleine, the souffle was very creative and just so delicious.
Good: Chocolate and textures.  It was good, because you always need a little chocolate but the souffle dessert was the best.

All in all we had a great dinner.  The atmosphere was cute and it was delicious.  The only negative thing I would say was that the service (for us) was a little lacking.  Being 20-somethings I felt like they didn't take us seriously and tended to other guests just a tad better.  Our server was very nice, but we waited a while at times.  

I highly recommend it.  Would be a great date place!"}
{"text":"We chose Chez L'epecier as our \"blowout\" meal of our trip to Montreal. And by \"blowout\" I mean both in quantity and quality of the meal and budget. And yay! It was worth it! And definitely make a reservation. We called about 5 days in advance and got the exact time we wanted.

We thought we'd get the tasting menu with wine pairings, but after hearing about it... we were both very meh. So, we decided to explore from the menu. Ordered a fabulous bottle of Clos Figueras wine. Given that this a French restaurant, I was appreciative of their non-French wine selections; limited, but good quality.

I had the fois gras and almost died because the fois gras was good, but pairing it with \"smoked yogurt\" was amazing. Also pairing this with the Sauternes and I thought I was in heaven. My husband had the razor clam app with edamame and highlighted with trout eggs. He was still talking about it two days later.

We both had the osso bucco. My husband had warned me that Montreal has some of the best osso bucco in the world and well... this was amazing. The polenta was only okay (not to my liking - a little bland), but the meat was so... I don't even have the words. On the side was also a vanilla/carrot foam that was really intriguing (and tasty on the polenta).

For dessert we had the creme brulees... which were a little surprising, but good! My husband did find some campari for his pre-dinner drink. I enjoyed a cappucino to end.

The waiter was very good; I'd give him 4.5 (not quite a 5 rating). I did appreciate that when talking with him about wine suggestions, he recommended some very reasonably priced bottles; we went with the slight less reasonably priced bottle. At the end of the meal, my husband was looking for some Averna or Kirch brandy, neither of which they had, but the waiter offered to bring some raspberry brandy (similar to Kirch) over for him to taste. And it was a winner...

We spent 3+ hours and a lot of $, but we got our \"blowout\" dinner (and fortunately a mile+ walk back to the hotel to burn some of it off!). It was lovely and well worth it. Met all of our expectations and threw in some interesting surprises as well.  I have to admit, my favorite part of this place (in hindsight) was the traditionally good food, but each with a surprising little twist that made it a bit of a culinary adventure."}
{"text":"Maybe 4.5 stars. Went here for lunch. I had the penne with pesto and cherry tomatoes, which was very good. Also had a good green salad. Hubby had a wonderful cheesy squash soup that I ended up stealing, then the cod wrapped in ham with salted walnut butter, which was delicate and complex and really good. Service was excellent. This is just a nice little restaurant, with good cooking and high-quality ingredients. The food is fancy but the place is casual. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I was invited to a restaurant for the holidays, having zero knowledge of it prior to setting foot inside. I had heard some murmurs of it but nothing solid. Chez L'Épicier (The Grocery Store in French) looks like a very upscale grocery store with canned goods, oil bottles and such all set in a charming Old Montreal where the old bricks and rock walls of the historical site give it its rustic elegance. Beautifully lit in subdued light, the spacious restaurant says welcome before the greeter can. 

The service staff so well coiffed, polite and elegant gave me fear for a pretentious dining experience, which I dislike. I can't stand art-food and refuse to pay the overpriced bill that comes with it. But the prices are fair for the quality of food to be eaten and I didn't hold back on ordering my desired plates for fear of paying too much.

Right out of the ballpark, I spot foie-gras on the menu as an appetizer. I can't resist foie-gras, it's the ultimate food-stuff I can think of. Life without foie-gras is pretty meaningless, that's how much I love it. But I love it well prepared. Having eaten the best foie-gras on this planet at Le Pied de Cochon, the bar is set stratospherically high. Chez L'Épicier did not disappoint. At one point I contemplated whether Chez L'Épicier beat out Le Pied de Cochon, but the texture made it lose out to Le Pied de Cochon. But don't get me wrong. This awesome perfectly seared foie-gras server on a croissant pastry and top with duck pâté was sublime. Serving it in a tiny cast-iron pan was a presentation coup that rendered it even more appetizing. There were expressed regrets at the table for not having chosen the foie-gras once it was presented.

Now the problem with foie-gras when well prepared is that it can easily ruin the rest of the meal. Foie-gras is like having sex with twins, pretty hard to top. I've come to accept defeat in these cases. With a few exceptions, the main-dish never satisfies... once again I am supremely surprised by the main dish: Grain fed veal chop, all dressed fingerling potatoes, asparagus au gratin and prosciutto chip. Now I was somewhat disappointed by the over-crunchy-not-so-al-dente asparagus (Also white asparagus is prettier, but doesn't taste as good as the green variety) but the lardon-lace gratin was good, really good. Someone says fingerling potatoes and I say \"Yes Please!\", enough on that, they were perfect. Same for the crunchy prosciutto. But the piece de resistance, the veal chop, was quite possibly the veal I've ever had in my life. I had never considered veal served as a 1 inch thick chop. I normally eat meat rare, but the chef suggests serving medium-rare. Good enough I can play along though there are only 3 possible cooking degrees with meat, rare, medium and the yucky well-done. Everything in between is basically a crap-shoot that depends on the cook's feel and attention, but I digress. Well it was perfect and the taste exponentially above my expectations, if there is such a thing. Had I had more money and stomach space to spare I would have easily gone for another mind-blowing veal chop. 

For desert I jumped so quickly at the thought of eating delicious soufflé (a rarity in restaurants these days) that I completely glanced over the word ICED. I was disappointed in not getting a traditional soufflé; however the taste of the homemade ice-cream and its toppings made me quickly forget. I almost didn't eat the fennel Madeleine, but thankfully I went for a taste anyway and it was amazing. I also ordered a tiny butterscotch-banana macaroon, so sweet you'll reach for insulin but small enough not to burn your palate.

This is my favourite way of going into a new restaurant, blind. Expectations easily lead to disappointment. Disappointed I was not, in fact it was an experience I will not soon forget and hope to relive.  Service was slow, but I'm told they were short on staff for the unexpected amount of clients on a date so soon after Christmas, which probably explains why some of the menu items were either no longer available or some ingredients were modified. This was not an issue for me, as I don't mind long diners with friends.

Oh oh I almost forgot...The Tom Collins... quite possibly the best I've ever had. They added something pinkish to it and I never asked for details. Awesome.

Despite some menu and service issues and keeping in mind it was the 27th of December, I really can't complain about anything. The food was above and beyond; the service despite latencies was great. I expected to blow a lot of money but it ended up costing me just above 100$ which is not expensive considering the quality of the food and service."}
{"text":"We loved this place! The ambience is so nice and we really loved the wine. The beef tenderloin entree was incredible and definitely not too small, as I have seen in other reviews. The garlic Rosemary butter that came with the bread was so good too!! Staff spoke great English and was very nice, even though we were late to our reservation."}
{"text":"Was there with a group of 8 for a bachelorette.
We had an excellent service from the staff. 
 
The amuse-bouche was a sweet and salty macaron, interesting and good taste.
They gave the wrong salad to a friend of mine and just gave us another salad so I was given a free salad for apetizer lol.
I shared their specialty meal that night, which was beef ribs that the server explained was for 2-3 people, for 120$. 

I would say it is easily for 4-5 girls... or maybe 3 guys.
We had a waste some food, sadly, but it was really good.

The deserts were generous. The sorbet was really tasty and we preferred the basilic flavor. The different creme brulee was flavorful, but a bit too sweet.

It's easily over 50-100$ per person."}
{"text":"I really wanna give it 4 and a half stars, but chose to round up instead of down because this place does not deserve a 1 star downgrade.  The food was excellent.  Every single dish.  We had the tasting menu and I lost track of how many things they brought us.  Everything was superb... but we must have been there for 3 hours.  Now, I noticed that in Montreal the dining pace is a little slower, but seriously, after 2 and a half hours, I wanted to tell them to stop bringing out food.  Who eats that much???  Anyway, the service was amazing and the setting was wonderful.  We had a very romantic dinner and walked out with some seriously full stomachs.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar and had the tasting menu with the wine pairing.  As is typical with a tasting menu, some items weren't as good as others, but overall this was a fantastic meal.  I actually would have preferred slightly smaller portions for some of the courses because I was so incredibly full afterwards.  I'd say this is more accurately a 4.5.  Great for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Ggggggggrrrrrrrr, is this place a treat. When we popped those olive and goat cheese amuse bouche into our gobs we all thought we were gonna die from spontaneous culinary multiple orgasms, and that was just the start. between the four of us we ordered everything on the menu and every single solitary morsel was spectacular.

YUM! Go, just go, L'epicier will not disappoint"}
{"text":"Looks better than it tastes...

The attention to detail is excellent. But it's one of those experiences, where you feel bad eating it because you have to ruin the presentation. The restaurant itself is cozy and unpretentious, and doubles as a market and deli (interesting oil selections).  As far as the taste, I wasn't too thrilled. Amuse-bouche was a nice touch, but it came as a cheese that was way too salty. Good thing there was a gallon of water on the table to quench my salted mouth. The seared tuna I ordered was ridiculously chewy, and I was definitely not amused.

Tips: Should have got the pre fixe, but it was out of my budget!"}
{"text":"I could hardly wait to get to Montreal so I could go back to Chez L'Epicier.  The amuse bouche was the macaron with goat cheese which others have mentioned.  Sounds awful, tastes heavenly.  Next a shrimp salad...not  big ole shrimp on the side of the glass with seafood sauce. Oh no.  Little bitty shrimp with red grapefruit sections and radish. Filet for entree and would I like wild mushrooms, in season, with that?  Oh yes, please. Perfectly cooked.  Dessert was a delightful pistachio confection with itty bitty spheres of meringue.  How do they do that?  A cup of tea and I was blissful while I waited for the check.  But wait! There's more!  The server came back, not with the check,  but with a plate of homemade marshmallows and a little burner.  Just because the chef though I might enjoy them...\"you know, like the campfire when we were children?\"  Yes, but we never had homemade marshmallows at any campfire I ever sat around! And now I'm ruined.  Ruined.  I can never eat commercial marshmallows again.  No one else got the marshmallow treatment, everyone was looking as I toasted them, and why I got them I don't know.  Maybe just because I was so truly, honestly happy to be there again!"}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant avec le menu de dégustation qui nous fait découvrir de nouveaux produits et des bonnes saveurs. Place assez romantique et très calme pour un bon moment de partage."}
{"text":"After agonizing over where to have our one upscale meal in Montreal, we decided on Chez L'epicier.  We were glad we did.  We did the tasting menu will wine pairings (note that 2 courses do not come paired) and our \"journey\" included a savory macaroon amuse bouche, gazpacho, gnocci, cod, goose, foix gras, and more.  The tastes were small but hearty, most with a delicious inventive sauce.  The wines were great and ran the gamut of classic French wines, and were well paired.  

The service was perfectly paced, with our server prepping our next course and pouring wine, and another server serving and explaining each dish.

We were able to get a same day reservation on a Monday night.  The space was about 3/4 full, and the meal took 2.5 hours due to the numerous tastings and relaxed pace.  The decor is modern chic, and there is a bar area to do bites/drinks.  

Dress code - you will not feel out of place if you aren't in a jacket - but I'd recommend making this your dress up night."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place only has two reviews! This place is in the heart of Old Montreal. I was happy houring and in dire need of food in my system, so thus started looking for places to chow. 

Chez L'Epicier it was with no reservation. Walked inside to a quaint cozy place to our hostess asking if we had a res... I said no. Then she asked me if I had tickets to the circus, and I said no again. Then, she finally said there were two seats at the bar which we were totally fine with. Our bartender waiter was very nice and popped open a bottle of vino. Our meal also came with a complementary rabbit roll (mmm think french japanese fusion). It was delish and the waitress who brought it out was very knowledgeable in explaining the dishes.

For appetizer we ordered the smoked salmon on vodka sauce topped with a little caviar. It was SO good, it just melted in your mouth! I couldn't wait for the main courses. We ordered salmon with veggies, and medley of beed (filet mignon and beef brisket).... both were DELICIOUS.... perfectly tender. Salmon I eat is usually overcooked, but this salmon was half cooked, half on the raw side and was great. The beef brisket also melted in my mouth, as did the filet mignon - perfect sized portions. I enjoyed every bite of it. 

Dessert menus came out on printed white lunch baggies (interesting look)... we ordered the chocolate sandwich, which to my intelligence, thought could have been made with real bread, and my bf thought it would look like an ice cream sandwich. But both of us were wrong.... it did look like real sandwiches with toothpicks in the middle but was almost like a creme brulee with a layer of thin cake as the \"bread,\" and chocolate mousse with a layer of thin chocolate cake. Very imaginative and creative.

Like I said, the decore was cute. Each table is decorated with a green apple on top of white pebbles - simple and elegant. Makes for a great date spot. Really enjoyed it here and would come back again!"}
{"text":"This is on the corner of the street and the wide windows allow for excellent people watching, especially as the nightlife starts pumping in the OP (Vieux Port/Old Port) which has quite an interesting cast of characters.  This place has a Bistro feel from the décor with the daily wine by the glass choices on a chalkboard.  I put my trust in the waiter to choose wines for me after I told him my preferences and he selected an excellent Burgundy chardonnay and a sparkling wine.  I unfortunately had to hold myself to two glasses but by all means go buck wild.  I would surmise there isn't a bad wine in the place.

I am a vegetarian but had no issues with the menu, even though Montreal is game heavy (I find).  The chef had foie as an option with pretty much everything but it wasn't a problem finding something without.  I had their cold asparagus soup, it had orange yogurt and the hints of orange worked with the asparagus in a way that I couldn't have imagined.  So the night was already won in my mind since I go to restaurants to find tastes I wouldn't be able to create on my own.  My second course, I had to choose the snails and prawns - when in Petit Paris do as the parisiennes do!  They were delectable, moist, tender, and in a garlic broth sauce that I used the rest of my bread to sop up.  My last course was my least favorite, it was a bean risotto.  I debated giving the restaurant five stars but ultimately had to do four as in my opinion it seemed this was the dish the chef put on just for us vegheads.  I didn't think the flavors were as well developed or as delicious as my other courses.  This was why I had to chop you (a star...) Ok no more Ted Allen for me.  :)  Anyway I would recommend this to anyone, the service was good although relaxed timing between courses (great for a date), décor delightful, and overall the food was fantastic.  

*Note to women - Don't wear high heels unless you are driving directly there and not going to walk the OP.  It is all cobblestone roads,  beautiful and treacherous.  Lesson learned...  But do feel comfortable dressing up."}
{"text":"Was in Montreal for business last week and visited this restaurant the first night we were in - I have nothing but good things to say as it was really one of the better places I've ever been.  The atmosphere is very classy and inviting and the service was excellent as well but let's get down to the important part - the food:

Shortly after we sat down, we were given a savory macaroon which had a goat cheese filling and was the best macaroon I think I've ever had - really great!  We ordered the egg roll for a starter which was filled with smoked meat and served with a housemade mustard - as a first time visitor to Montreal, was super pumped for this gourmet take on a classic and it was very superb!  I had the beef tenderloin with the black garlic potato puree and this was really so unique and tasty.  For desert, we had an assortment of macaroons to share and I had the medly of crèmes brûlées.  Each one was very unique and tasted great!  

What a treat to try this place - on my next visit to Montreal, will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"For my final MTL a Table dinner, I went back to the Old Port to another longstanding member of my \"need to try\" list - Laurent Godbout's Chez L'Épicier. About to open a sister restaurant down in Palm Beach, Chez L'Épicier has been a highly regarded restaurant in Old Montreal since its opening. A friend of mine continues to states that one of the best meals of his life has been here. Talk like that has made my visit long overdue. Hype level was high which can be scary when dealing with restaurants. There is nothing worse than overly heighten expectations setting you up for a disappointing experience. In these instances, you just need to go in and have faith that the restaurant can shine through with excellent dishes and a fine touch.

Pre-starters, we were greeted with a cocktail of maple syrup and apple cider as well as an olive and goat cheese macaron amuse-bouche. Loved the combination in the cocktail - the acidic nature of the cider dull by the maple syrup while keeping the sweetness level strong. The macaron was a interesting idea - I had never had an non-sweet macaron before. My hatred of olives had me skeptical however the use of the creamy goat cheese eased that olive taste which I despite. Very nice level of technique.

Our first starter was a squash velouté poured over homemade sour cream, onions, squash seed nougatine, parsley juice and brown butter vinaigrette. Cool little presentation element as the velouté was poured at the table over the bowl of accent ingredients. Loved the smooth and earthy nature of the soup and how each extra item brought a nice element to pair with the squash. A perfect fall starter.

Our second starter was a slowly cold smoked trout filet with a miso and maple reduction, shallot fingerling potatoes and a maple vinegar mousse. Wonderful flaky texture to the trout with a subtle hint of sweetness from the reduction. The mousse was a quirky but nicely flavoured addition and the potatoes brought some more heft to the dish. Very good.

The first of our mains was a sea bass fillet with herb polenta, lobster juice bouillabaisse and vegetables glazed with water butter. The real star here is the bouillabaisse - if only because the lobster juice overpowered everything else. The fish itself was solid. I am not a big fan of polenta up front so while this one was well done, it didn't speak to me in any way. The vegetables were good but nothing to write home about (which is ironic as I am writing about them). Overall an okay dish. I feel like the fish should have had more of an impact in this dish.

Our final main was beef shoulder lacquered with orange and olives served with onion and rosemary butter brandade and reduced juice with Cointreau. Huge winner in my eyes. The beef shoulder was cooked perfectly - to the point where you early had to touch it for it to fall apart. Great richness to the beef and the hints of orange and Cointreau came through nicely. The brandade was excellent as well.

The first dessert was a carpaccio of compressed apples with tarragon granita and caramelized pecans. Sadly I didn't get to try it because my friend finished it off so quickly which one can definitely take as a good thing. Loved the concept overall - the tarragon being an interesting addition to apples and pecans.

The other dessert available was a tempura brownie with greek yogurt cream and white chocolate jelly. The brownie itself was moist and chocolatey - a key for me with any brownie. Personally, while the tempura was well done, I'm not sure how much of an addition it brought to the dish other than texturally. It kind of felt like an afterthought - added at the last minute to make the dish \"unique\". I enjoyed the smoothness of the yogourt cream as well as the presence of the white chocolate and strawberries. A solid finish to the dish.

I had high expectations for Chez L'Epicier and they were mostly met. Very high level technique was visible throughout the meal - the highs were oh so high. However a couple of dishes had a few elements that left us wanting more. Not things that were a big deal but when compared to the rest of the dishes, they stood out more than they should have. All in all, I was quite happy to finally cross Chez L'Epicier off my list. Looking at the regular menu after my visit, I was intrigued enough to want to come back which I suppose is all that needs to be said.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We did the tasting menu w/ wine. We will definitely return. Service was top notch & they treated everyone w/ a smile & good service. I loved it"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I guess I just don't care much for Contemporary French food.  

My girlfriend and I chose here as our Montreal special dinner.   We are both disappointed. 

I went for the tasting menu, nothing impressive, the taste is average and presentation is so-so.  The wine paring is a joke, it is basically whatever wine they offer by glass. 

My gf ordered the duck breast, overcooked.

The service is not bad, but again just average."}
{"text":"we went there in 2009 and LOVED it.  loved the location, the atmospher and the food.  so want to go back."}
