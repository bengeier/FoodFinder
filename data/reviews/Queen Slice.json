{"text":"Definitely not one of my top meal choices for the area. I generally only go here for a cheap slice of pizza when I'm running low on cash.

My first and likely last experience with the shawarma here involved them adding a southwest sauce to my pita after asking if I wanted \"shawarma sauce\" (I thought this meant tahini). While it didn't taste terrible, it completely changed the taste and ruined the meal for me."}
{"text":"Rating places like Queen Slice is difficult because I have to decide whether to rate it objectively or for what it is.  Objectively, Queen Slice isn't that special, 3 stars maybe, but for what it is, a fast, cheap, greasy student eatery, I would say it is the best thing on that strip of College. 

My favourite thing at Queen Slice is the falafel pita.  At $3, it is hard to beat in terms of price for this area.  The falafel balls are pre-made somewhere and reheated when you order.  The toppings available are very basic; onions, tomato, lettuce, pickles (?) and hot peppers.  There's no hummas or tahini but there is their 'special sauce', sort of a spicy tomato-y mayo that, though not normally what I'd associate with a falafel pita, is DELICIOUS.  I recommend giving it a try, though this isn't an authentic style falafel pita, I would actually say it is better than the two middle eastern places down the street. I am not a meat eater but I have heard that the shwarma is good as well.

As for the other menu items I can't really comment.  What I will say is that I saw them making a pizza there once and they use a packaged, pre-cooked crust and just add the toppings and put it in the oven to melt the cheese which seems really bizarre to me.  People seem to like it though so maybe it isn't bad.

To comment on the atmosphere, it has ample seating, a hilarious wall mural, a TV always on and a surprisingly good selection of magazines to leaf through while you wait.

If you are in the UofT area and looking for an inexpensive lunch, I would say that Queen Slice is a great bet, just don't expect authentic middle eastern or italian."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of their shawarma at all, although there aren't too many choices around UofT.   How can you serve shawarma with no garlic sauce and instead put a mix of ketchup and mayonnaise and call it a \"special sauce.\"  The pizza, although not the greatest, is cheap and reasonable."}
{"text":"I am a poor student at the University of Toronto and this place is honestly a hidden gem for me. I know the name is Pizza and Pita but there is only one thing to get here. The Chicken Leg Dinner. You get a nice leg and yuumy rice, and a small salad and a pop all for around 7 dollars. These are not the huge chicken legs you could make yourself but it is a good dinner for the price and the sauce is really good. Every time I get it, my lab mates freak about how good ti smells."}
{"text":"I went here again, looking for a quick bite after a midterm that ended at 9. However, when I got there and asked for a shwarma, they didn't have a pita. Ok, I thought, I will just get the hamburger. Well, they didn't have the buns. I thought, ok, I will get the falafel. No go. She told me I could order pizza and that was it, even though it wasn't close to closing. What's the point of having those foods if you can't serve them when people want them? Even if you don't have one thing, at least make sure you have the others...I left disappointed and not buying anything."}
{"text":"A typical student eatery. Located literally across the street from the main entrance to UofT's Campus (King's College Rd.) It's a good place to grab a quick slice of pizza and/or schwarma/sandwich before your next class starts.

It is a really wierd place, they only serve 3 types of pizza, Queenslice (which has schwarma chicken, peppers, n others), Pepperoni and Vegeratian - all of which are \"ok\" and I have never dared try anything else. They're also licensed to sell beer so if you're looking for that doozy before your most hated lecture, you know where to go.

Plus is that they have a nice LCD TV in front of the tables so at least you have some entertainment to keep your mind off what you're eating at the moment."}
{"text":"Came here on a sad weekday night while working on an assignment at school. Paid around $8 or something for a chicken leg dinner. It tasted OK but they give you your food on some really cheap styrofoam plates with similarly sh*tty plastic utensils that can barely cut through the chicken. They also seem to have problems taking out the trash, I had problems shoving my plate in because the garbage bag was so full.

You get what you pay for, but this place wasn't even that cheap and you can get a much better deal at other similarly priced places in the area."}
{"text":"This was always a great place to grab sustenance in the measly half-hour I had between class and my evening usher shifts at the Hart House Theatre, as it is close-by and serves the edible (a rarity around these parts, I'm sorry to say).

I would go so far as to say pretty surprisingly good, at least where the pizza is concerned. It is one of those places where the menu seems a bit of a hodge-podge, and thus I expect diminished quality on both (that being pita and pizza) fronts. I always went with the vegetarian and found it pretty good every time, especially appreciating the brush of basil/oil on the crust- just like Mossimo's does (look out!). The TV was, yes, a cool bonus, just like the magazine rack. Killed time and hunger effectively, efficiently, while not being too delicious or exciting to make me late for work."}
