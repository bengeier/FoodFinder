{"text":"The portions is great and the flavour packs a punch. Ordered the honey gangjeong and garlic soy flavour."}
{"text":"Came here to try out the Korean Fried Chicken Saturday night and there was only 1 table to our surprise.  We got the Bone-in Half and Half (Curry as one and Soysauce & Garlic).  The curry was bland and wasn't flavourful at all.  We all liked the Soysauce & Garlic one and they gave us some sauce to dip as well.  We also got the bone-less Green Onion which was not bad as well.  I still prefer The Fry but this place ain't bad but the atmosphere needs a little work. There is only 5-6 tables so it is a small place to begin with."}
{"text":"Better than The fry! Small place, but we were there for good chicken and beer. Very tasty and good service! Wish I had pictures to post. Don't try squid though... that was disappointing! Go for chicken."}
{"text":"This place is right on Yonge Street in a very small plaza actually a bit hard to find if you not looking. Craving some Korean fried chicken and found this place.   Order the drunken fried and soysauce and garlic (S). Unlike other fried chicken,  Korean fried chicken uses the whole chicken. I really enjoyed the soysauce and garlic flavour the drunken fried was there version of regular which was okay. It comes with coleslaw and radish and complimentary popcorn we added a fries/onion rings ($4). Two order was enough for three people. I would definitely come back to try other flavors when I'm craving Korean fried chicken."}
{"text":"This place was cute small and good. The service was good and delightful. I would most likely come back. When I went they must have just opened because there was no one in this place but myself."}
{"text":"This place used to be yogoberry but they've changed to a chicken place. Been here twice now and their soy garlic chicken is  probably one of the best I've had. Their spicy chicken is also great.  Also tried their honey chicken and regular sauce one and those were just okay. Next time I will try the curry chicken!"}
{"text":"Best Korean chicken! Portions are good and worth every penny! Must try. Real Korean chicken flavour.! Recommend to people who really wish to taste  Korean chicken!"}
{"text":"They open till late. we got there at 10:30pm, parking is right beside the restaurant, which you don't need to struggle for finding a parking spot then walk far to get to the restaurant, due to we are on Yonge st!) Ordered a seasoned garlic fried chicken wings, they taste good. Banana with the wings, new idea to me. Recommend it!"}
