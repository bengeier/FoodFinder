{"text":"Food is good. Fresh house made broth great flavour and not salty like most soups I have at restaurants... Fair price for quantity and quality of food. Beef Flank soup is really good here. Service was fast!"}
{"text":"As a family of beef noodle fans, after passing by a few times we finally walked in after a 4 hours hiking trip.
This one star goes to the environment-very clean by all aspects.
The bowls of noodles  looked good and tasted like Taiwanese style at first sip. However here are the two points that cannot lure me back: First is the significant MSG that took over my tastebuds quickly. Second is that the noodles were not freshly cooked - let alone freshly made."}
{"text":"If you go to this restaurant the number one item is the beef noodle soup. However, they have many other fantastic dishes such as lamb soup, beef rolls, and many others. Let's go back and speak some more about the beef noodle soup. This restaurant truly makes the best Taiwanese style beef noodle soup. I have had this soup many times, and I have never grown tired of it, even though I consider myself a very picky eater. 

This restaurant is definitely the number one in its category in the city of Toronto. As a matter of reference, I have had this soup in many places over the city, and over the world. Whenever a new place opens I always try the beef noodle soup, yet it never compares to the one here. Not only is the food excellent, the staff too are friendly and offer great service.

In regards to another review, the decor is standard for a restaurant of this style and calibre. These places that truly care about the food will not try to disguise it with extravagant decor. I have eaten all over the world, in many restaurants like this, and the best ones always look like this."}
{"text":"I came to this place when I crave for beef noodles.  They specialize in Taiwanese and Norhtern Chinese style but it's nothing like the beef noodle I had in Taiwan.  However, I find it to be tasty with good portion of noodle and beef.  The broth is also flavourful but not as spicy as I'd like.  For the price, I think they are also generous with meat.  I also tried lamb noodle but I personally think it's more suitable for winter season.  Service is quick and owners seem friendly.  The price is also very reasonable and it'd fill you up for 10 bucks.  3.5 overall for the flavour, price and service."}
{"text":"The restaurant name does the food justice. The beef noodle here is truly sensational!

-1 star due to the decor. 

I have been here several times and have only ordered the beef noodle soup along with some dumplings. The noodles are SO GOOD that I would feel ashamed if I came here and ate another dish instead of the house special! The soup has so much depth, the noodles are flavorful with good texture and the beef are large pieces and super tender. They have never skimped on any ingredient in every visit I've paid.

Don't let the outdated decor and less then impressive parking lot deter you from trying this restaurant. It will really be THE BEST beef noodle soup you would have tasted in Toronto!"}
{"text":"If you look past the decor of the place, you can find yourself enjoying a yummy bowl of beef noodles! I always find myself having trouble finishing a whole bowl because they give you lots of noodles. But this place is definitely my go-to when I'm craving for some. 

Each bowl comes with around 4-5 pieces of tender beef brisket, a handful of chewy udon noodles, and two heads of Bok Choy that I love. You can choose between the spicy & non-spicy beef broths (personally I like the spicy one) it's unfortunate I wasn't introduced to this place earlier, as some reviews I've read have stated that their beef broths used to be a lot spicier! *not complaining tho*

In addition, as most beef noodles usually are, the broth is not too salty. Rather it's actually quite flavourful and addicting - probably due to the MSG, but some extra MSG sometimes won't kill you, right? 

As I've mentioned before, the decor of the place is quite old, and their cups & plates can be a little on the dirty side occasionally, but the service is quick and friendly. Overall super inexpensive, friendly service, and yummy beef noodles!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best beef noodle place in town. It is a must try item from their menu."}
{"text":"Father - Daughter Beef Brisket tour goes strong. My dad and I share a love for beef brisket noodle and the Beef Brisket here at Beef Noodle Restaurant goes to the top of our list. 

Order: 
-Beef Brisket , approx. $8 a bowl - Udon noodles, healthy handful of tender beef brisket and two heads of bok choy all in a bowl of flavourful soup (that I slurped up!)

-Onion and Beef Pancake Roll, approx. $8 a bowl - Large onion pancake wrapped around beef and peaking duck sauce. Get your napkins ready because this is a greasy one.  

Service - 5/5 - Despite coming here during the lunch hour on a Saturday, our teapot was never empty for too long. With a flip of the lid a waitress came and refilled our pot right away. Pretty solid service for a Chinese restaurant. 

Credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty beef noodle soup. Will have to come back and try the other stuff, but this is definitely a hit. Nice pieces of beef, probably brisket, super tender and flavourful. The broth is simple but flavourful, similar to pho but more meaty. The thick noodles are nice touch too."}
{"text":"LOVE the cold noodle at this place. (I don't really know the English name for this dish but just mentioned cold spicy noodle they will understand you) Best noodle place in the uptown area. I would recommend this place to anybody who is really into noodles."}
{"text":"I have to say, this is the best place for spicy beef noodles! They have tasty, crunchy pigs ear and good seaweed salad. I believe it was 3 of their cold appetizers for 7.50 but best place for only these items that I've tried so far. Jelly fish here is pretty good. Service is standard Chinese service, but the ladies always do try to make an effort which is better than none I suppose?"}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant for soup in Toronto. The beef noodle soup for which the restaurant is named is a filling meal for a very low price, about $10. Large tender beef chunks, fresh bok choy, a fantastic broth with just enough spice, and your choice of 3 noodle varieties (rice noodle, glass noodle, or ramen noodle). 

My personal favourite variety is with the ramen noodle. 

The staff is friendly, the kitchen is quick, the good is delicious, and the prices are low. There's nothing more to ask for in a family run food business.

I highly recommend this place! Tell them Rich from Kanama High Performance sent ya."}
{"text":"Opened for decades. I remember going here on the weekends some 20ish years ago, until I moved north. The beef noodle was as delicious as I remembered. However the couple of appetizers I had, like the green onion pancake, pork wrap and pan fried dumplings were delicious, but just not as delicious as some of the new comers in and around the GTA. But the price is defiantly more affordable than the rest."}
{"text":"Went at lunch.  Pretty quiet.  Good service.
Good lunch specials.  For $8 or $9, you get main dish and rice.  We received free large bowl of hot and sour soup to share which was pretty tasty.
The rice dishes are pretty big, tasty and piping hot.  The stirfried noodles are pretty big as well.
We ordered beef noodle soup spicy - noodles and beef were good.  But soup not spicy and not as tasty as I remembered.
Lunch special menu is pretty good.  They also have a daily special.
Overall, would visit again but food is not as good as I remembered."}
{"text":"First time going to this restaurant, it is located in this plaza close to midland and Sheppard. This restaurant has been there since 1990. That's what it says on the menu. The beef noodle that I had was okay, I would rate it a 6/10 because I think a lot of people might not like the type of the noodles that they use in the soup, and also there was only 4 small pieces of beef, which I think it is kinda not enough to finish the noodles.  I was happy with the lunch tho, fast, make me full, close by my workplace etc. Will go back some other time maybe I can write another review give them better rating. You guys should try it too."}
{"text":"Went for a solo lunch because I was in the area and my real destination across the street was closed. I wasn't super impressed with the beef noodles soup to be honest. It's listed as the most popular item on the menu and a lot of people on here raved about it but I was underwhelmed. The noodles weren't chewy enough and the beef wasn't savory. I also got the cucumber app and for 4 dollars it could have came with more. Save your money and try somewhere else in the area."}
{"text":"Been coming here once every few months for years! 
Their most known for the beef noodles, which don't taste like other places. It's really good and hits the spot. Not sure if I'm just biased because I've eaten it for so many years haha. The soup is a bit salty but tastes good. The noodles are thicker and chewier, so it is rather filling. Normally I order a bowl of noodles and some type of their cold appetizers like the bamboo shoots or cucumber with garlic. Their onion pancakes are great too!

Nice little spot in the corner for some taiwanese food at a reasonable price. :)"}
{"text":"**3.5 STARS**

Apparently the management had changed in this restaurant in the last few years, but my friend said that he still comes here, mainly to commemorate the previous owner.

I really really really wanted me some beef noodle soup, so I came here.  As opposed to Jennifer K's review, the beef noodle soup that I had was pretty flavourful, and the meat was so-so tender.  I found the noodles to be absolutely delicious (same with the broth).  My friend and I also ordered the pickled green noodles, which they are well known for.  I think eating that against the beef noodle soup didn't make it very flavourful.  However, it was still great!

We also had the pork stuffed green onion pancake.  This was REALLY good.  Kind of reminded me of beijing duck mainly due to the green onion and sauce that they had put it.  Get it with the pork instead of the beef.

We also started with appetizers that you can pick out from out front.  We had the jellyfish (which I LOVE), and pickled cucumbers.  The unfortunate thing about the jellyfish was that there wasn't enough!  I guess I was expecting a heapful of jellyfish.  Otherwise, great food here."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 5 if they served alcohol. The food is great from the items I have tried. I usually get a combo since you get free soup which is quite large.  You could just get full from the soup if you can finish it but I never can so I always take to take it out.

Definitely give this place a try, I like to order the chili pepper fried squid, soooo good."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you're looking for cheap and delicious beef noodles! I come here every time I'm craving chinese food. It's cheap, the portions are huge and they have summer and winter specials if you want some great deals. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant since I was a teenager and I recommend anyone who can handle some spicy food to check this place out. 

Some dishes I would recommend are of course, the beef noodles, the hot and sour soup, and the double cooked pork with rice. I pretty much order this every time I go and its always delicious :)

I do want to mention that the quality has gone down over the years since the beef noodle soup base isn't as spicy. Regardless, the double cooked pork makes up for the spiciness and both are worth the try!"}
{"text":"Really tasty and hit the spot for a windy cold day! Without exception, order the beef noodle soup. Udon-like chewy noodles with savoury broth that has a little chili kick, and cubes of tender juicy beef! Satisfied the craving for slurping noodles, that's for sure. We also got to try the scallion pancake (regular, just fried dough) and the onion meat pancake which is rolled into what looks like a burrito wrapped in foil! That one was good and paired well with the soup. The spicy hunan chicken wasn't spicy at all, but just tasted like sweet general tao's chicken. Wouldn't recommend for vegetarians, as the one with us didn't have any flavourful dishes to choose from."}
{"text":"It's been years since I came back here and the taste is still the same! I had the beef noodle soup with brown sauce, green onion pancake with pork and hoisin sauce, sweet and spicy eggplant on rice and another popped rice dish with seafood and green peppers. I don't really know the exact names lol. Their noodle soup is definitely a must here and their most popular dish. I would recommend all the dishes I got. I generally enjoyed everything.

For the beef noodle soup, you get about 5-6 pieces of beef with a piece of bokchoy that's been cut in half. There are a lot of noodles (thick and chewy) so the portion is huge. Only complaint is the amount of MSG in this so be warned! The pancake is relatively small and could use more pork for sure, fresh green onion and hoisin sauce. But the taste is good. The eggplant is a sweet, yet slightly sour and spicy dish with pork. Lastly the popped rice tastes great. If you love popped rice this is your dish. There is also some scallop and cuttlefish along with mushrooms, green bell peppers, onion and such. 

The waitress here was very friendly as well. We were seated immediately as the restaurant was about less than half full. It was quite empty even though we came around 8pm. Definitely check out this place!"}
{"text":"Best Beef noodle soup!! Spicy. Big beef brisket pieces, usually not fatty, but the one time I brought my dad here....

Friendly staff, quick service. Lots of seating. Recently started opening at 9:30am.

Onion/beef pancakes are great too. Looking forward to trying other menu items."}
{"text":"I came here for a late dinner the other night after badminton. I ordered their Taiwanese style beef and tenden noodle. I have to say by far,  this place has the best Taiwanese style beef and tenden noodle I have had in Toronto so far. The soup was not too spicy - although for people that love spicy food,  you can ask the restaurant ti add more spicy to it. The price for the noodle was I would say cheap. Next time I am going to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"20 Yrs ago with the original owner this would have been the go to place for beef noodle soup. Not anymore. 

Very salty, msg, artificial taste, baking soda beef. The price is right, but with so many restaurants offering better beef noodle soup, i won't be coming back here. Asian Legend is only a few mins away. Go there instead."}
{"text":"Been to this particular place only a few times and it never disappoints me.  By looking outside of the building which mainly consists of Chinese characters.  It's hard to tell that this joint serves up some of the best tasting soup on this area of the GTA.  

The name of the restaurant pretty much explains what they specialize in.  That's right Taiwanese beef noodle soup.  There are many meat and vegetable options but in my opinion the thick beef noodle with dark broth is the go to dish.  Also available are the usual items such as that stir fry dishes and dumplings. 

Atmosphere is kind of strange with an array of random photographs on the wall and weird statue along one of the aisles.  Overall a great dining experience and quick service help keep this place a local favorite."}
{"text":"Being half Taiwanese I love myself a good beef noodle soup.  The ownership has changed since Jennifer's review as Joanne has mentioned.  Nonetheless, I believe this place is a great find and perfect for those with a budget but want a good noodle.

Pros: 
Very good beef noodle soup.
Great value

Cons:
Location may be too far for some

This review basically focuses on the beef noodle soup.  It's essentially the name sake and specially of the restaurant.  The beef noodle here is one of the best in the city I have had.  Easily top 5.  The broth is great with a little hint of spice.  The beef in very tender for the most part and they heap it on for you.  The noodles are very decent but won't be anything to special.  The best part is the price at $6.99.  That's pretty much also one of the cheapest you'll find as well.

The interior of the place hasn't changed much over the years.  I'm basically coming for good cheap meal so it doesn't bother me though.  The location is Brimley and Sheppard so that may be too far of a trek for some, specially downtowners.

I really like this place.  I come with my girlfriend all the time when we crave beef noodle.  2 Beef noodles and a side of vegetables for about $20 including taxes.  Yum and good for the wallet!!"}
{"text":"Beef noodle soup quality is consistent. It tastes very good, same as I remembered from few years back.

The restaurant serves a variety of Chinese southern and northern dishes, so it feels like it doesn't specialize in any particular dish. The kung pao beef tasted very similar to twice cooked pork. So even when I took out the portions that we couldn't finish, there was no point in using two different containers. 

The mixed cold appetizers were on point. Especially the flavored tofu curd was awesome.

Don't know why the restaurant has two dollar sign, because it's fairly cheap. Well worth the price that was paid. Should be one dollar sign."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place randomly while searching Yelp for some good affordable food. Been here twice since and only had the stewed beef noodle but I can say it is as good as everybody says. It come with lots of noodles in a rich beef broth, tender stewed meat and 2 pieces of Shanghai bok choy.

They serve it very quickly too so you can have a fast, affordable, and tasty meal."}
{"text":"The beef noodle soup is really amazing, and everything else isn't bad.

The beed noodle soup has really delicious soup, chewy fresh noodles and soft flavorful beef. It's really rare to find such good quality beef in any other restaurant that makes it :). Soooo good"}
{"text":"Being Taiwanese, I have high expectations when it comes to our traditional dish - beef noodle soup. Seeing what my peers had ordered, I would only recommend coming here for their beef noodle soup. Let me break down the bowl of soup even further to their individual components. 

Noodles (3.5/5) - The noodles are freshly made by hand. This means that someone is tossing and pulling the noodles to achieve that chewy texture. It is good but not great. I felt that it was on the thicker side which lacked the tenderness and chewiness of the traditional beef noodle soup in Taiwan. 

Soup (3/5) - The soup is quite nice and flavorful, but not enough. I felt that they had put a large amount of MSG and spices, which ruins the natural bold flavor achieved from slow cooking the beef and the vegetables

Beef (4/5) - This was the best part of the entire bowl. They were extremely tender as they just slowly fall apart in your mouth. Very flavorful and delicious. It was disappointing when they only put around 5 bite sized pieces in a large bowl of noodles. 

I also tried their Suan La Tang (Hot & Sour Soup), Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) and Jian Jiao (pan fried dumplings ). I really disliked all 3 of these dishes as it tasted stale and plain. I would rate all three of these dishes 2 stars.   

The pricing of the food is very cheap. Ie. a bowl of noodles is approximately $10 after tax. If you are craving for a bowl of beef noodle soup in Scarborough, this place would be your best bet. I would highly recommend not getting anything else from this restaurant."}
{"text":"The reviews really prompted me to come here several weeks ago (I forgot I ate here until I went through my pictures) with my boyfriend on a cold week day.
We came in as soon as they opened and their kitchen was ready and fired up to go.

The staff is competent in English if you can't speak Chinese and very, very, very friendly.

Honestly, the beef noodle was meh. It wasn't inedible but I did not think it was on par of what everybody else though.  I thought the beef tasted slightly weird and chewy but the soup base was amazing - I wish they offered other types of noodles and meat in this soup.
The dumplings were subpar besides the fact they were massive.

I'll come back here again but tbh it's does not stand out from other similar restaurants surrounding it."}
{"text":"2.5 Star

Beef Noodle Restaurant still offers great value but sadly still lack the quality.

Chicken with Cold Noodles in Hot and Sesame Sauce ($5.95) was served in this huge bowl that enough to feed 2 of me. 

The chicken and noodle is quite standard. Nothing I cannot make myself. The sauce though was the weakest part as it is not hot at all. So I asked for some more hot sauce, the lady said next time would be a $1.50 surcharge for that and I should not have ordered this dish if I want spicy!

Even with the extra hot sauce, the dish still lack the kick. 

Now it might be another few years I would come back to eat at Beef Noodle Restaurant....."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always ordered the beef noodle soup and it's good. Been going here for years and it never disappoints me."}
{"text":"Came here after Yelping around the area for dumplings, as Old Neighbour Restaurant had apparently closed down and left us hungry  food. Yelp did not disappoint! This place has their beef noodle brisket advertisements on the walls and all over the menu marked as it's number one seller. Literally, everyone we saw walk in ordered this special dish. So, of course, my friend and I ordered two bowls, along with a great serving of dumplings. 

Neither of us eat very much, so ordering one bowl and splitting it along with the dumplings would have rendered us incredibly full. However, the beef was so perfect and tender, the bok choy seeped in delicious broth, and the noodles incredibly thick and flavourful, that neither of us regretted finishing our entire meal. Each of us had one or two dumplings while they were steaming hot and realized they tasted better when stabbed a little and then dunked in the soup broth so that they could soak up a little beef flavour. We did have to get a to-go container for the dumplings, however, but it was a great deal for the whole meal and we had it as a midnight snack later on, and they were still delicious. 

Service was pretty attentive as well, which was a little surprising for an Asian restaurant (I'm used to staff having to be waved down constantly), and we did have to wave down a waitress for the bill, but the restaurant wasn't super busy at the time and she got it to us right away.

tl;dr: if you're in the area, definitely come around for the beef brisket and dumplings. I don't live nearby, but I would definitely come back just for the amazing stew."}
