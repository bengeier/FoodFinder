{"text":"Haven't been here myself in a few years and I am surprised to read the terrible reviews. The food here was delicious. The fried chicken was great and we even used to order large orders for take out for big groups. Like a lot of other places around here, the administration probably won't pay the salary required to get a trained chef.

Very sad"}
{"text":"This was possibly the worst meal we have eaten here.  Most of the food put out for the supper buffet was dried out and long past bring eatable.  The wait staff is very nice but that alone won't have us returning any time soon.  It is off our \"go to\" list."}
{"text":"If you order a ready made salad better bring your own dressing for it, they don't offer any. Just for an added touch the cashier throws your change on the counter instead of handing it to you."}
{"text":"Waited 5 or more minutes for a menu. 5 more minutes for drinks. Watched our server serve others including people that came in after us. Food is so so. Cheap ingredients. Decor and cleanliness are okay."}
{"text":"I'm a commercial driver myself, I'm not going to bash on the place I like The Iron Skillet, first visit here at this location was great, older gentleman was helpful, friendly, got my food and left. Now, I do only get 30 minutes before hitting the road again so time is crucial. I visited this same location again tonight 3/18/16 at about 10:15pm or so with the hopes of another great meal again, but instead the employees I do see working seem as if they don't want to be there and we (customers) are a burden, not a single greet, there was this slender short haired lady in the back area no one at counter, I called for her she comes around and simply said \"what do you need\" asked her if orders are still being taken to go, me not knowing it's 24 hrs from what I just saw on here, she said yes, asked if I knew what I wanted told her not yet, looked at the menu for me to get, she said \"I'll give you a minute\" and simply walked away, 5 go by, by the 10th minute I walked around saw a guy taking dishes to the back called for him just to see if he could call the lady again who had completely disappeared, not to my surprise by now he ignored me, so I just left considering I do only have 30 minutes before having to hit the road again, so I settled for 2 sandwiches from the mini convenient store in the same lot, not what I expected as a meal for me to enjoy after putting hours in of driving, I did like this location until tonight."}
{"text":"Worst place to eat, I have not felt this uncomfortable eating somewhere till now. Every single person who was their eating kept staring at me and my bf and his friend. I didn't know it was a crime to be a Latina and eat comfortably somewhere. Fuck this place !!!!!"}
{"text":"OK, this place is a truck stop, but when you are hauling a large 5th wheel trailer, the options are limited.  I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  There was an issue with the restrooms and shower rooms had been opened to the public to use during renovations and it is a bit tired.  On the way to the table, we walked by the breakfast buffet.  My husband thought it looked good, I didn't.  (Breakfast is not my favorite meal.)  He had the buffet and enjoyed it.  I had the opened faced  sirloin steak sandwich on garlic toast with coleslaw.  The steak sandwich was perfect!  Although the coleslaw was a little wet for my personal taste, it was very good.  Our waitress was outstanding!  When we got ready to leave, she asked if I wanted a to-go cup for my iced tea (which was served, in addition to a full glass, with a small pitcher).  If we are up there way, we will go back."}
{"text":"Sitting and waiting for meal. Read the reviews and it sounded good. Husband had tests so he has not eaten since early yesterday. 
Waitress not very friendly and order took a long time coming!! The food was good and plentiful. We were pleased about that. Waitress did not check on us once. Chatted lots with customers who appeared to be regulars. Cashier and other staff were very nice. Pastries look yummy!!! And are made right there. The cost was reasonable and great for the quantity. Debatable as if we will return."}
{"text":"Let's cut the ca-ca and call this place what it is, shall we? It's the Pear Tree, it always has been, and let's hope it always will be! It's a truck-stop, there's greasy, belly-and diet-busting buffets that'll make your soul sing today and cry tomorrow. Best of all, breakfast is available also, 24/7, and when is chicken fried steak or bisquits 'n' gravy ever NOT a good idea? 

The Pear Tree/Iron Skillet is a quick, reasonably- priced belly full; it's 24/7 and definitely several steps up from Shari's or Denny's... but in the broad category of Truck Stops, it has to clear the aisle for the undisputed King of the Road, Jubitz...."}
{"text":"Our family has been eating at the Iron Skillet for many years.  It is a great stop for truckers, but is great for the locals too.  They have a buffet that varies, menu items, and great steaks.  You are bound to find something to eat between the great salad bar and general food choices.  Kids eat free on Sunday which makes a nice family day.  They serve plenty of food at fair prices."}
{"text":"I try to eat at Iron Skillet every time I find myself in the valley.  It is my favorite lunch place and has been for this past 10 years!  They serve a great buffet; and at an excellent price!  The variety of salad toppings is pleasantly sufficient, and the other food usually has your choice of two or three types of meat, a few vegetables, mashed potatoes, and gravy.  Great-tasting down-home food!  The staff is very nice and even surprised me one day when they remembered my last visit :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE the chicken fried steak at Iron Skillet the texture is awesome, the seasoning is perfect, I love the breading its a semi thick breading but its flaky and perfect.
   You've got to eat here to know what I am talking about:-) they also have breakfast buffet, I think a lunch buffet, and they have a dinner buffet. Their buffets are pretty darn good and affordable. This is a truckers restraunt the food is awesome and comforting for those truckers that are making the long halls, there is a little shop, bathrooms,showers, and movie room, and video poker. This place has it all for he trucker and weary traveler :-)"}
{"text":"We were hungry and this was the only restaurant we could get to... It was actually really fun! The grilled cheese I had was so so so good... Can't tell if it's because  I was so hungry or if it was actually good... My husband got chicken fried steak and ate every scrap. We got some coupons from the truck stop (classy, I know) and used those. We are not an overweight couple but we ate like pigs and loved every minute. If I had to choose between that and a subway I would choose subway but that was fun for a night and it would be a good choice if you need some comfort food. (We got hit by a car on our way out of town and we're pretty shaken up...)"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Affordable and clean. I love that it is 24 hrs. It does not serve alcohol. :( Maybe that is best for a truck stop though. Has a tv room, full salad bar and buffet. It was recently decorated. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is ghetto and great!  Ws with  party of 5 and all the bills were split correctly and out waitress was awesome.  Will be back for the salad bar."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by before heading out to the speedway.  Its a truckers joint on the outskirts of town.  They have driver only seating that is mostly small comfortable booths. Then the buffet area...

I went during breakfast hours... Nice simple selections.  But the best is the DIY hot waffle iron. Warm syrup is the best...

Ill probably check in for lunch...stay tuned"}
{"text":"Buffet was really terrible.  Do not get lured in just because you are starving and need a hot meal. Order something safe off of the menu.  I am just not sure how you can make terrible macaroni and cheese or even a terrible brownie!  A boxed brownie mix and boxed Mac and cheese tastes 200% better.  Heed the warning, my friends."}
{"text":"I never thought that after dining down town and at Texas Station I could top the gross buffet award.  Unfortunately, I discovered it on accident.

We love finding odd diners and holes in the wall that have amazing food.  This place is odd and a hole in the wall but the food is amazingly disgusting.

The buffet is not cheap at $8.99 for breakfast.  Aliante buffet is not great but at least it is cheap.
The food was cold and greasy or hard.  Some items were completely inedible and I was perplexed at some of the offerings...what are they?

The service was average and the waitress asked us if we were sure that we wanted the buffet.  She tried to warn us.
We both ate very little and still felt slightly sick all day.  Bad, bad Iron Skillet."}
{"text":"we had a great Breakfast there a week ago. Food was fresh and the staff was great. Will go back again without a doubt. Thanks for a great meal you all."}
{"text":"We ate there last night, the service was great, the food also was very good. We actually had breakfast for dinner. I had a veggie omlt. Husband has chick fried steak. Huge portions and reasonably priced. We went there 15 years ago and it wasn't that great, we were leery to go but very glad we did. They also have a bakery with fresh breads and desserts. Didn't try that we were too full from our meal. We will be back."}
{"text":"I love diners so I've been wanting to eat here. Well I did and it was not at all what I thought it would be. The food at the buffet had been there all day out and drying up by the time I got there at 6pm. The people were very friendly though but the food needs more attention cause it really could be a great diner if they switched out the food and kept it fresh."}
{"text":"Nothing like greasy heavily buttered food to get you through the long day of either being a trucker, taking the 15 into or out of vegas, or doing something at the motor speedway.

Been to Iron Skillet many of times and if you're expecting something classy and low caloried HA good luck!

It's American comfort food and it's good for the most part. I've eaten here a few times a month when i used to work for a motorcycle racing association back in the day and due to a lack of options the Iron Skillet was always the place to go. It's close enough to the motor speedway so no one has to go to the opposite of our destination just to meet up and have a meal, and it's fast."}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer here, but it seems every year the food gets worse. Today I was in town on a layover and had lunch with friends. Lady friends patty melt was barely warm, her fries even less so. The grilled onions on it were hardly grilled at all. The other two meals were decent, but nithing more. For desert we got a large cookie with ice cream on top. This is shown as a hot fresh baked cookie in a skillet, topped with ice cream. Wd got a semi-stale cookie on a plate, barely warm at all (and obviously not fresh baked) with a tiny scoop of ice cream in the middle. The edges of the cookie were so hard as to be inedible. The \"Pazookie\" at BJ's Brewery is what we expected this to be like. Not even close."}
{"text":"I love the huevos rancheros with chile and peppers. I drank orange juice on the side and enjoyed the soft breakfast platter with eggs, sausage and you can get extra bacon. I personally loved this restaurant and hope you will too."}
{"text":"I gave them a 5 base on everything.  Everyone was nice and the food was satisfying... I ordered steak and eggs skillet with a biscuit... Nice and full.. After a 8 hour drive, great to be around good energy.  Every passing through, you should give them a try!"}
{"text":"The iron skillet is a truck stop restaurant, so as expected you get good portions for fairly cheap. Have buffets most of the hours. Chicken fried chicken was juicy and good. Club was a basic home made sandwich, they didn't have avocado to add to it. Staff was all friendly. Ran out of water, never got more. They have sugary bakery products we took back to our room. Fudge was ok, nothing great. Staff did tell me not to purchase the one fudge flavor because it was dried out today, I appreciate the honesty and caring. Giant cinnamon roll was good. Ate half and gave myself a stomach ache. Little store has your basic needs, as well as some country themed gift shop items. Breakfast buffet was very good, and well priced. They dropped off a thermos of coffee for the table, so I didn't have to wait for them to refill. Found an entire mini cup of half and half in the bottom of my coffee. Seems it's had turned and jelled or something. They also donate yesterday's bakery foods to the Phoenix food bank."}
{"text":"well if you want or like average, this is the place to find it. Average as can be.

It is just another typical truck stop diner. However at the same time, its not typical when compared to many of the places that I recall from my youth on cross country treks.

The food was both better and worse in various ways... For example, I believe that the buffet here must be the best option but unfortunately neither the Munchkin nor I took that option. However both of our orders came with a trip to the salad bar. Which we both got a good salad to go with our meal. To be honest, that was without a doubt the best part of both of our meals. The lettuce was very fresh. The spinach was just starting to wilt, (but it was a sustained 105+ degrees for the last week at least) so that wasnt a surprise. They have tons of fresh veggies to add on and a number of types of dressing to add if you are so inclined. Absolutely delicious and tasty. My only problem with the salad bar is that the upper items are hard to reach which included the lettuce and the spinach.

I ordered one of my all time favorites for my main course, the chicken fried steak. It was overcooked,came with great garlic toast and i got it with country potatoes (home fries here). However the home fries didnt have any onions or bell peppers mixed in and were made without salt and pepper it seemed. The CFS was good, but would have been much better if not overcooked. The country gravy was either really good canned gravy or so so fresh gravy but didnt have any sausage bits in it like you would normally find in CFS. So it ends up being very average.

My daughter got the chicken alfredo... It was very good well grilled chicken and less than average alfredo sauce that was served with almost mushy noodles... al dente is not spoken here to say the least. So yeah kinda average again, but it will be lunch manana for sure.

So as you can tell, they do some things well and some things poorly. Thus they are average as can be. However they are close to the freeway at the north end of town and right next to the LV Speedway... From what I bet, they will be slammed on race day and otherwise are just a handy place coming into or leaving las vegas to the north..."}
{"text":"Geez.  I wish I'd travel with people that have some friggin sense of adventure.  Would have much rather have checked out the Omelet House in Vegas, so allow me to vent.

That said, this place is adequate.  Convenient to gas, restrooms, and store.  NOTHING spectacular.  Similar to an IHOP or a Denny's.  Prices maybe a little better.

Ordered a BLT.  Standard fare.  They brought out everything but the BLT.  Forgot to make.  Also, shouldn't have ordered the cole slaw.  Yuck.  They took it back and told me to help myself to the soup.  Sandwich, when it arrived, was good.

Wait staff was friendly.  Parking was plentiful.  Come here if you've missed anything interesting because there is nothing else for miles beyond.  Don't forget to fill the tank.

BTW.  They actually serve your food on a skillet.  An aluminum skillet :-)"}
{"text":"This little truck stop diner is great! They serve typical diner fare and comfort food. I've been here a couple of times, usually on my way out of town on a camping or hunting trip. The food is delicious and portions are huge, as we usually have to take leftovers to go. 

My personal favorite is the chicken fried chicken - you can even make it a double order for an additional  $2.99! They also have a buffet during lunch and dinner, but I have not tried it. Looks decent for $10.99 though. 

The staff here is nice and I've never had a problem with our orders or having our drinks refilled. The food comes out hot and fresh, and fairly soon after you order. It does get a little crowded here on weekend mornings or when there are events at the Speedway so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"This is better than most Petro /TA truckstops.  Service was very good. The place clean. What most can a person ask for..."}
{"text":"Ugggggh. All right. So. I grew up in Talent and went to high school in Phoenix. This truck stop was one of our regular late night stops for biscuits and gravy and waitresses who didn't ask questions when a bunch of teenagers chain-smoked, ate biscuits and gravy, and drank coffee. When I came back for a visit eleven years later, I demanded my friend bring me back here for said biscuits and gravy. 

But -- behold -- not only were biscuits and gravy being served on the morning we visited, but an entire breakfast buffet of greased up life nuggets. I ate the shit out of that buffet, guys. I think I blacked out at one point and traveled back in time to a place where my metabolism was fast and my heart less burny. 

Problem though. I wasn't used to that, uh, \"rich\" of food. My stomach hurt immediately and wasn't right for two weeks after. Seriously. I had to do a three day juice cleanse to get my body back in working order. WORTH IT."}
{"text":"As one of the only restaurants in the area open after 8pm you can't really complain that the food wasn't great. Equivalent to something I could drunkenly make in the microwave it's probably better when you're sauced. Perhaps better in the daytime?"}
{"text":"After a long day at Crater National Park, we stopped by this restaurant at 1 AM in the night. And these guys were amazing. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and the food was perfect. It was nothing like what you'd expect so late in the night. Would definitely go here if I'm ever near the area again!"}
{"text":"I generally stop-in here a couple of times a year while passing-through 'Vegas while on my way to Utah or other points north.  Food here is a bit better than you'd expect to find at a Truck Stop.  Having the option of a Buffet is nice.  Servers are friendly, food seems to be fresh when I've eaten here.  Good place to grab a bite before getting back on the road.  Be warned though, if you're driving North this is the last place to get food (or gas) for quite a while!"}
{"text":"This is truck stop.  I went because friends decided to meet their before heading to the race track.   Clean and airy.  There was some sort if breakfast buffet going on, but ordered from the menu.  The service is friendly and prompt   I had the carnivore omelet.   First of all, it find't come as described on the menu.  The eggs were over cooked and so was the stuff inside except the bacon was alright.  The home fries were bad.  Soft and mushy and no flavor.  This place will do in a pinch but not if you want a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Honestly, we weren't expecting much from this truck-stop greasy spoon, but it looked like the last chance for breakfast before Valley of Fire.

We were pleasantly surprised.  We would up getting the $10 \"Sunday Brunch\" that even included mimosas.   Brunch and mimosas at a truck stop?  Yep, and it was good.  

Loved the make your own waffle iron.  All of the food was pretty good, except maybe the scrambled eggs.  So we asked for a couple fresh scrambled eggs and we got them--no problem.

We had great service too.  I was quite impressed with this little place.  It also had a decent convenience store and very clean restrooms.

Definitely worth a stop on the way out of town!"}
{"text":"Well lets see after our group of 8 was seated by the rudest server at two different table we asked if we could could push the two tables together. She looked at us and responded \"I guess\" and stood there and watched myself and mother try to make this happen with two small children and no help from her! We then sat down and she took our drink order before passing us off so she could serve her 3 tables around us. I looked around and spotted another employee sitting in the corner texting ( at.first.no big deal maybe she was on break). We then had our order taken by a young nice lady, we ordered food from the kitchen and 4 buffet lunches. We then got up to get food from the buffet where I witnessed an employee bare handed grabbing food from the line and then shoving it in her mouth! I watched this happen at least 5 times with all different foods that were out. We then waited and waited for the kitchen food to come out, when it finally did everyone one around us had been fed including the table sat after us and everyone who had ordered buffet was finishing eating! As we are sitting there finishing up I look over to see the same employee still sitting at.the table in the corner now conducting an interview/ or hiring a new employee. I asked who she was she was the manager on duty Erika. Not only was she witness to everything that happened she sat there listening to us loudly talk about what had happen and did nothing! she was to busy to even stop texting on her cell to conduct her interview properly. She did take a minute to stop our server and had her get her coffee since she couldn't be bothered to get up and do it herself ! The food is over priced and not very good so to add crappy service and you have Iron Skillet Las Vegas NV!"}
{"text":"Hard to find a good diner/greasy spoon in Vegas
Food is always fresh & good Service is even better, always nice and pleasant 
Do yourself a favor and drive 15 minutes out of Vegas get service, prices and value you deserve"}
{"text":"Iron Skillet not only renovated its restaurant with an outdoor theme but enlarged the buffet and has significantly improved its food, if my visit to the buffet Thursday is an example of their regular fare.  I had a pepper steak that consisted of bit-sized pieces of steak and bell peppers plus a piece of grilled chicken that was moist and tender. A very solid three stars. But the cake I tried was cloyingly sweet.

The service is still friendly and efficient. The truckers' area is now in the old bar and is very classy with animal prints, sculptures and a replica of a Native American canoe hanging form the ceiling. If you are in a hurry; try the buffet--if rates well with Hometown Buffet in Medford."}
{"text":"The food was good, not the best I've ever had but I did go back for seconds on the biscuits and gravy. Not a very big spread for a $8.99 price tag-especially since it didn't include the drink. 

Service was below par- no one welcomed us, the waitress dropped the menus at the head of the table and told us she would be back. Came back took our drink order and the rest of the time we were there it seemed like she was too busy to have to deal with us. 

Come here for a decent buffet, don't expect great service!!!"}
{"text":"There were plenty of cheap eats. Service was great. Mini-cinis (cinnamon buns) include your coffee!  I did like the Italian sausage handheld sandwich for the price.  They had a special listed that included your drink for $21. 


Service was nice and the hostess have us a big greeting at the door.  We'll have to try it again when we are here for Nascar.  They have a salad bar that you can box your order for take out. Great to know."}
{"text":"Will not come here again. I ate during their Buffett and the food was cold and tasted as if they cooked it two days before. The sevice was good but the food needs some work. The cost was just not worth it as well."}
{"text":"Yummmmy yum yum this is we'll worth the stop and the staff is super friendly and fun our waitress was awesome you have to stop here . It seriously is awesome and fun . Great place . The food is really good I like it it . Stretch your legs look around and I hope your hungry"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  Free meal for Veterans on the 4th of July!!  Best pancakes, great veggie omelet --good food and excellent service from Rhonda!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here before heading back home. Ordered the sausage, egg and hash brown skillet that also came with a biscuit. Everything was delicious! The coffee was so good I had like 4 cups. Will definitely be eating here again. They also have a breakfast buffet for $9.99. My bf got that and he said everything was good."}
{"text":"Staff was awesome. Food tasted exactly like what a 24-hr diner should serve. Dad enjoyed the chicken fried steak and mom had the berry pie. I had the hot fudge sundae. All good."}
{"text":"Truck stop food. About as cheap and nasty as it gets. Often the food here is scary! Beware!"}
{"text":"Uuuggh so full!
Decided to try out this place for breakfast. I was tired of my usual Farmer Boys (I love them too), but wanted to see what else was out in my neck of the woods. My cousin mentioned this place by the speedway and I'm glad we went. 1st off PANCAKES are phenomenal. I had the ham and cheese omelet w/ a side of hash browns and their biscuits. It was super yummy. Next time I want to try their biscuits and gravy. My girlfriend had the French toast sandwhich and that too was pretty good. The only thing I felt, was that the toast needed some flavor to it. I ended up just diping it into some syrup  ... My cousin got the breakfast combo and didn't leave a single piece to share! Lol 
For being at a truck stop, the place can serve up some pretty decent breakfast meals

I gave this place a 5 because they were quick to bring us our menus, drinks, and food. The server also kept checking on us even though she did have larger tables to assist, so that's always a plus when I don't need to ask for my server!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in years, won't bother going back.  Went mid-afternoon after a lot of shopping. Surroundings appeared clean and wait staff was very friendly and attentive.  

All of the hot food on the buffet was old, dried out, had \"skins\" on it, was picked over and looked very unappealing. The fried chicken was bland and dry as sand. The fried fish was hard as a rock. My husband said the brisket tasted ok, however, it was dry and unseasoned. Mashed potatoes and mac and cheese were tasteless and you could tell had been on the hot table for a long, long time.  

The salad bar looked better, however, it was evident that pretty much everything was out of a can or a bag. The pasta and potato salads were bland and had \"skins\" from not being maintained. The cucumber slices, sliced olives, chopped celery and others were actually frozen to the bottom of the buffet serving dish and looked disgusting, again because they had not been maintained.

The dessert options left much to be desired. There was a passable chocolate mousse with whipped topping, which, sadly, was served at room temperature and not kept chilled. Also offered were three cakes, a yellow, a chocolate and some sort of yellow cake with a cinnamon sugar topping. I chose this as it looked like it might have more to offer than the standard cake options.  My square of cinnamon cake was so hard and dry I could pound it with my knife and not dent it.  What a waste.

Happily, the iced tea tasted fresh and was strong and very refreshing.  Actually, the tea was the best part of the entire meal, so there was some redeeming factor in the experience.  Overall, we were greatly disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place. On my way to Seattle, saw this place and had the country fried chicken steak,mom had the meat lovers omelet with sausage gravy. OMG if u live big portions this is the spot for u."}
{"text":"Now this place here gets my business at least 1x per week. I work in the middle of nowhere in NorthEast Las Vegas. This is the only place that serves food in our area without having to drive 15 mins in each direction during a 1hr Lunch break. The service is Amazing and the food is DELICIOUS.  I will have to admit I've only eaten 2 items on the menu but I can definitely vouch for their French Toast Combo and the Cheeseburger. 

Oh yea, my company receives a 10% Discount also.WINNING..

I'll Be Back (in my Terminator voice)!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Unfortunately they are struggling to stay open (ever since the bridge construction began), but this is some of the best real truck stop food for many miles (disclaimer: there's still one I haven't tried yet). Not open after midnight anymore -- really upsetting. But food is still fantastic. Buffet is well worth it... A bit much pork for my taste, but a lot of solid, healthy meat and veg options. Real food -- mostly from scratch (some exceptions); every dish is better than Hometown. Ordering from the menu shows you they have some real talent in the kitchen. Way better than Shari's, yet Shari's gets the crowds. Never a good soup, but the fruit/salad bar and dressings are on point, and you can often get packaged salads to go (with free dressing). Waittresses ... A lot of turnover in wait staff here, so it's hit or miss, and yes you are advised to get their attention immediately, for sure.  Anything more than dessert, should expect $13-20 per person.

Also, it's a truck stop, so there are some other perks. Fancy a shower? I think it's $13 for a private shower of unlimited duration. You don't have to be a trucker.  Nobody bothers you. Very relaxing, and a nice break from the road."}
{"text":"This is the restaurant located on the LVMS (Las Vegas Motor Speedway) property and it is attached to a gas station. 
It feels like a truck stop...maybe because it is...but the food, service and location were all convenient and efficient. 
As for the food: It is a buffet so don't get 2 excited! I had the buffet twice and ordered off the menu once. ORDER OFF THE MENU! lol 
I got the steak and eggs breakfast and it was all around decent. Nothing special, but also nothing to write negatively about. 
Try them out if you are in the area and need a bite...

Enjoy"}

Very poor service."}

We had a wonderful Christmas party thanks to you and your hospitality team!"}

{"text":"On the way out of Las Vegas, I stopped for food and fuel. The Iron Skillet buffet really looked good. By themselves, tater tots aren't all that much. I'm not sure what was in it, but the sauce and cheese that were added to the normally bland tater tots made them amazingly delicious."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. The buffet wasn't too bad either. The seafood was amazingly good also."}
{"text":"Mmmmm I love this place.  My grandparents always took us here when our family made our semi-annual trips to Costco.  I think the little iron skillets they serve the food on are ADORABLE.   I love their pancakes and the light whipped butter they provide for them.  I also had their biscuits and gravy...  Oh soooooo good and it stuffs you.  Its been a while since I have been there though so I would like to go back next chance I get."}
{"text":"Based on the buffet, I cant believe my friends recommended this spot for breakfast. As we were walking to our seats, you could already see that the selection was very limited.

We all had the $10 buffet so i had to try a little bit of everything and of course it all had to taste just how it looked, dry and stale.. powdered eggs, biscuits, sausage and and unfortunately, yes the bacon too!!! If you like self made waffles, you might just have something here, but I literally stuck to the oatmeal with brown sugar and berries. 

It was sad to say, horrible. Please dont waste your time here, you are better off buying food and snacks from the gas station next door."}
{"text":"Today, I ate at the Iron Skillet because we had a 2 for the price of one coupon from the Medford coupon booklet that was $20.00.The Iron Skillet is a rest stop mixed in with a bakery and restaurant all in one! The menu choice had a variety of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options all within reasonable prices.

I was going to choose a food from the menu, but decided on the buffet instead. You can't beat the price of $10.95 for an all you can eat lunch buffet. There is also the option to only eat what's on the salad bar for about $7.00.  They had a variety of options steamed cabbage to ribs and the food was hot which is a plus! The beef brisket was my favorite, the meat was tender and had a smoky after taste which was DELICIOUS. I will come back to the Iron Skillet just for the beef brisket.

Overall, the food was good and the service made the whole experience more enjoyable. Carol did an excellent job making sure everyone was taken care of. Thank you for the AWESOME hospitality Carol  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decided to give thee old Iron Skillet a try. I'm drawn to a buffet so I thought I'd give this one a try. 

My server was Jorden, who was very friendly and professional. She kept the glasses full and kept the dirty plates (skillets) off the table.

Not super impressed with the food. The highlight for me was the Pork Roast (after covering it in a white gravy). Everything else was just so-so. With that being said, they do have a great salad bar! Lots of fresh ingredients and toppings. I focused my remaining stomach space and effort on the salad bar.

As others before me have mentioned, the salad bar is a bit challenging when attempting to reach the upper selections. Basically, there is a glass window that you need to reach under and then over the salad bar lower sections to reach those top ingredients (see photo). There is a skill set needed to accomplish this upper-level salad bar extraction, but with patience and focus, most anyone can be successful. 

They have a breakfast buffet but when inspecting that the next morning, it was a bit small and not really appealing. I'll be back on my next trip through Vegas just to see what other things they have available. All-in-all, it was a-okay for the price. Two people for the evening buffet ran a bit over $26.49. Thanks to Jorden for being so nice and for great customer service."}
{"text":"As I sit here nomming the last of my biscuit, I reflect on a PERFECT diner experience. Dudes. They have GRITS! Nowhere else in the valley has grits. Move over Debbie! We found a new neighborhood go-to! Friendly and cheerful wait staff. Everything served in tiny skillets. Old fashioned traditional diner coffee mugs. 

Win. Win. WIN!!!!"}
{"text":"Fried fish was really good (wasn't oily and the crust wasn't overwhelming)... the garlic bread it came with and the tartar sauce: everything was good. [substituted regular fries with home fries: probably wasn't a good decision]
Chicken Fried Steak: steak was okay... eggs (asked well done): did them as per request.  Sour dough toast was good... hashbrowns: okay.
But good service.

They had a lunch buffet too, for $10.49... some choices were good... good salad bar, some fruits, regular food did not feel appealing :some fried food, chicken wings, brisket: none of them looked appealing... with dessert too... seemed like a good deal if you are hungry."}
{"text":"2min? 3min? 10min? How long you need to wait for a menu and a drink. Been here 25min now smh!!! Well tip you won't see from me that's for sure. Treat for treat. I hope the food is good at least. Suck truck stops customer service jeeeeeez"}
{"text":"Great staff very friendly from the minute we walked in! Ok, my dinner was delicious chicken was juicy and my daughter Fried white fish was good and seasoned well.  I ate some of her fish lol"}
{"text":"I can only speak for tonite 12.8.15
I got no service till I was about to leave.
Gal finally brought me a glass of ice tea
I noticed she was only tending to one table. Hell the manager wouldn't leave the cash register to see if the patrients were getting served...all i can say is I'VE HAD BETTER SERVICE IN JAIL"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Had country fried steak and eggs along with homemade biscuits. The staff is friendly and attentive, and we'll return again."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after our camping trip got snowed out, we decided to go to a hotel so that we didn't wake up to a collapsed tent. We got into Phoenix at around 9:30 we had been driving looking for a hotel with vacancy for close to an hour. We were starving and literally freezing. 

This place is open until 11PM which was a wonderful surprise when you are starving, we were also really excited to be able to get breakfast at 10PM. I got the veggie omelet, for a truck stop diner it was pretty damn good. The dude got chicken fried steak and again had no complaints. So it was a win. The service wasn't the greatest but it was close to closing so that is understandable. The Buffet looked questionable at best, but what we ordered from the menu looked way better. 

They also have a small convienence store inside, they had a terrible razor selection, but if you are in the market for wireless headphones or any type of phone charger, this is the place to go. We left all of our snacks and food at the campsite we abandoned for the evening. 

I would come back given the need for decent breakfast food while driving through Oregon."}
{"text":"I went in tonight for dinner food was great and I've never had better service. Brenda was an amazing waitress she was very attentive and was very helpful. I will defenitly be coming back.!! Thank you brenda.!"}
{"text":"On a long road trip, you get to a point where any restaurant will do as long as you can get a cup of coffee, and a bite to eat. I wasn't expecting much and this restaurant surprisingly was a great find! 

I wish their signs were a little easier to see coming North bound on I-5. My hubby just pulled over guessing where he remembered it to be, and he was right! But I think it would help if they had better signage on the road. Iron Skillet is a food restaurant offered inside Petro. Don't ask me why it's like that but you'll see the words, \"Petro\" long before you notice the sign for Iron Skillet. I think Petro is also the name of the gas station next to it. They offer a gift shop inside the bldg. before entering the restaurant. A lot like Split Pea Anderson's for those of you familiar traveling South bound on I-5.

Anyways, the food was good! We both had soup and salad Buffett. It was great variety, and I felt comfortable with their cleanliness. I liked it way better than any fast food joints around. It's not fine dining, but really good for a pit stop on your way to somewhere else."}
{"text":"Today my husband and I decided to check out the remodel at iron skillet. First off, it looks great. Very clean and full of friendly servers. Unfortunately we missed the breakfast buffet so we had to order off the menu. I got the meatlovers omelette and he got the steak and potato skillet with a side of corned beef hash. 

We got our drinks right away and never ran out. The food took a bit to get out, but it was well worth the wait. Eggs cooked perfect, everything nice and hot, and the hash was great. 

I've always been a fan of this place, but it is so much better now."}
{"text":"Its a truck stop. Good food quick service. This place always hits the spot for a quick hunger fix. Their breakfast buffet is filling and full of great choices. try the waffles."}
{"text":"I love to stop at new places, especially truck stop dinning for sure. Like usual affordable and huge portions. I love how everything comes out on a skillet. Try this place out when you are leaving north out Las Vegas. If you are into good comfort food with big portions."}
{"text":"Good food. Servings are huge. Love how they cooked the bacon. The best thing is kids eat free until labor day!"}
{"text":"They have an interesting concept that all the food is served in skillet plates. The breakfast buffet has a good selection with standard choices like scrambled eggs, French toast, bacon, ham etc. then there is also a few really nice choices on the buffet like southwestern salmon Benedict.  The fruit selection was good too. The hamburgers on the other hand leave a lot to be desired.  They were the standard pre formed frozen patty that after cooking barely makes it to edge of the bun and is really thin with no flavor. Service was excellent and they even suggested a dish to not order, which was greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"I know this is a truck stop, but something edible would have been nice. The soup was too salty to eat. The steak was so fatty that literally every bite had unchewable fat on it. I only had several bites from the whole steak. So I looked forward to dessert, since I was still hungry. I received a stale, dried out piece of pie. The whole meal was just gross. I'm not even that picky and I just wanted a simple meal!"}
{"text":"The Iron Skillet buffets are typically good, however this was one of the worst ones we've encountered.  The salad bar was OK (hence the 2 stars) however the main course options were blah. 

 Fried chicken that is not crunchy, dry Salisbury steak made of hamburger patties, dry pork chops, dry veggies.... you get the point. Even the butter for the dinner rolls was yuckie, and liquid.

 Pretty much everything was dry and looked old and unappealing, including the dessert.  The dessert was some mystery fruit flavor, and you guessed it, dry and old."}
{"text":"Can't beat the Skillet.. I have only tried the buffet and this one is fairly expensive in comparison to other Skillets around the country. average meal is 13.95 while you can get same meal in another state that isn't so touristy for half that. Good quality and the service is good though. We travel around alot and I can say that this is a place that doesnt give me those horrid road stomach pains.. so its a win if your heading out."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place is overpriced if you miss the dinner buffet. They are open 24/7, so not many other choices if you are trying to eat dinner around 1am :/

The food is not much better quality than something frozen that you would microwave at your house. It tasted much better to me because I had spent the day at Crater Lake and hadn't ate anything all day.

If there are other places open, you probably have better options."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. My wife and I decided to eat here for breakfast. Staff was friendly and prompt. They have a breakfast buffet that was nice and hot. Staff was constantly attending and ensuring the hot dishes were fresh. Salad bar was well stocked and fresh. Some of the desserts seemed old maybe they had been sitting out. The doughnuts were good. We didn't order off the menu. Very clean restaurant. They leave a coffee pot at the table! Cute country store as well. We will be back."}
{"text":"After a visit to Glittering lights we were looking for a place to eat and so hungry we stopped at the first place.  Well after years of looking, I finally found a place with a worse buffet than circus circus.  There was litterally nothing edible other than the salad which was borderline. If you are on a diet, this is the buffet for you.   They had several things that were unidentifiable.  We couldn't even eat the soup.

Dissapointing because the concept seemed good and the kitch level is mid to high."}
{"text":"The only reason we were here for breakfast was because it was right around the corner from the Vegas Speedway Race Track.  

First off, the buffet food was garbage.  The chili tasted looked like dog food.  Everything just seems like it's been out on the counter for a long time.  I opted out of the buffet and ordered some pancakes with a side of hash.  It's like your typical Dennys or IHOP feel.  It does it's job and you really cant' ask for more.  You kinda know what to expect at this type of place.  

Service: Our waitresses were very nice and even gave us to-go cups for our ice teas.  The food came out super slow though even though it didn't seem that busy in there.  

Bottom line: Again, you get what you pay for around here in Vegas.  For this to be a truck stop, it's not bad.  They even have laundry and shower facilities on site!"}
{"text":"Typical truck stop food
 Buffet did not look good at all. Wife had decided club sandwhich would be a safe bet. I had chicke fried steak w/mashed potatoes. Both meals were good. Breading on steak was crispy and flavorful."}
{"text":"This is the crappiest buffet but I love it!!  Me n the hubs come here for lunch a lot.  One time we came and they had little cups of cake on the buffet for dessert.  It was like somebody working in the back finished frosting a cake, stepped back to marvel at her masterpiece, then accidentally knocked it on the ground.  And instead of throwing it away she scooped it into little cups and decided nobody would notice.  
The food there is good!!!  I dunno about dinner but lunch is solid if you're not picky."}
{"text":"Oh man, how did I get dragged to this divey meat-lovers paradise? Oh right, I work for the next year on the side of I-15 and was hungry and in the company of construction guys. For them, this little truck stop diner was just the gem they were looking for.

Upon entry there was no hostess, so we ended up seating ourselves in a little side room. Fortunately, we didn't wait long and were greeted by an energetic waitress with a fabulous attitude. If nothing else, I must say I was extremely impressed by the service in this joint. Our waitress had a great disposition and was funny as hell. I found this quite refreshing as the service in Vegas has really gone downhill with bitchiness as of late. 

As a gluten free vegan, there really wasn't anything I could eat here. I was really hungry though, so I braved the home fries and a bowl of plain oatmeal. I can definitely say they tried pretty hard to accommodate considering my dietary restrictions; a cook even came out from the back to confirm that olive oil on the potatoes would be ok. That was a nice, and unexpected, surprise considering most restaurants don't care as they should. 

Overall, the ambiance is quite kitschy, the food is average, but the service is superb. If you're hungry and on the north side of Las Vegas, Iron Skillet might just be worth your time. 5 stars for service, 3 stars for food, 1 star for ambiance--overall rating a solid 3/5 stars."}
{"text":"Went to have Corned Beef and Cabbage for St. Patrick's Day...ugh!  Never again.  This was on the Buffet and I spent $13.99 for garbage.  Both the Corned Beef and the Cabbage were very, very overcooked.  Absolutely no flavor.  The Corned Beef was nothing but shreds, short shoe strings.  The Cabbage was falling apart, it was so overcooked.  Presentation on the Buffet, there was none.  Thrown, literally, in the pan with lots of mushy, boiled Red Potatoes.  I had to dig thru the Potatoes for the Corned Beef.  When I asked for more, they brought more over cooked shreds, which the Busser called Corned Beef Hash.  He needs some training, definitely, along with the Tall, Blonde Waitress who thought that the Pork Roast was Corned Beef.  Something has happened to the quality of the food and service at the Iron Skillet.  It will be a long, long time before I give them my money and my time again!"}
