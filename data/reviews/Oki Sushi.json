{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. After plans to see a movie fell through my husband and I decided to grab some sushi. Not being familiar with the area I looked for the highest rated sushi restaurant. We pulled in and immediately realized it was in the grocery store and I looked back at the reviews to see only 4 people had rated it. My husband was already resolved to eat NOW so we took a chance....I am so glad we did! We both ate for a total of less than $15 and quite honestly, it was a bit cold -but I know if I had taken it to go, I would have given it 5 stars. Not the romantic dining experience I had hoped for but it really was a great value for good quality. We sat next to an elderly man who needed a little assistance and the sushi chefs completely obliged his requests! Great service and a really fantastic experienxe"}
{"text":"We love having this minutes from our house. I prefer it over the other higher end sushi restaurants. Marcel is amazing."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing and with fantastic costumer service. What a refreshing personalized experience that Marcel provided for my son and I. 
We will absolutely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place does not exist.   Would greatly appreciate that this be removed from yelp."}
{"text":"Good quality, though imagination and selection are at times a bit less than what you'd like. They do a good job here and as a quick stop while shopping in a grocery store, are a great option, like 5 stars at that. But I wouldn't go just to have sushi there. Like their Rainbow the most as a person with a shellfish allergy I need to have something instead of crab or some california roll inserted into an already nice mix of salmon, tuna and yellowtail. The eel inside is a cool but simplistic touch.

So yeah, check em out if you're shopping at the Metro Market on Cottage Grove. But it's not like you should make an appointment or something."}
{"text":"Yummy fresh sushi made to order. You can take it to go or sit in the pleasant dining area.  Some nights feature a pianist."}
