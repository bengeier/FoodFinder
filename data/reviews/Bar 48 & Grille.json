{"text":"Mediocre at best service from a waitress with a serious attitude problem. Inconsistent food, burnt and over seasoned generally. Takes forever to get anything. Overpriced as all get up. The bartender is super nice though and the beer prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Best wings in the state of PA, honestly my favorite, try the sweet buffalo sauce. If I'm around and want wings this is the place my buddies and I go every time."}
{"text":"Love this place, beer is cold, food is fresh, hot and delicious! Bartenders are very nice and have a sense of humor ;)
Big menu! Lots of options."}
