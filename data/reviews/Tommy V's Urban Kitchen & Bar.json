{"text":"Swung thru for dinner after wanting to eat here for a long time. We sat at the bar, service was a little slow for being just a few people at the bar. Ordered fried calamari, which was good, a bit chewy for my liking and served with a marinara sauce. For entree I ordered braised short rib with spinach gnocchi and my boyfriend ordered the scallops. Short rib was good but my only issue with the dish was that it was two decent size portions of meat served with six tiny pieces of gnocchi on a plate of gravy. I ate one piece of the short rib with my gnocchi, which went pretty quickly..and then left with one chunk of meat and nothing else to eat with it. The dish needs something else or more gnocchi. My boyfriend liked the scallops. All in all everything was good. But not great."}
{"text":"Tommy Vs killed it last nite!!  Had a surprise birthday party for my wife and we had 11 for dinner.  Zoran and his staff so took care of us, had menus printed saying Happy Birthday Candy, set us up n private room and had the best staff waiting on us.  We all ordered something different inc apps and literally everything was great. Anytime we're n Scottsdale Tommy Vs will b a must do.  Thanx for making this a memory maker!"}
{"text":"Exceptional food and excellent pricing. Don't understand why it does not get more customers."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants!

Absolutely the best Italian restaurant in Scottsdale in my opinion.The food is of excellent quality, fresh, deliciously prepared and healthy, and is presented beautifully and simply, with attention to detail. Try the Bucatini, its out of this world!  The wait staff really knows how to wait tables -- they're respectful but friendly, and have perfect timing. And considering the quality and quantity of the food, the price can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Lunch today, crispy gnocchi & Cheeseburger with fries.  Both solid dishes however the sauce with the gnocchi was a little flat.  The menu however was loaded and demands that we return soon."}
{"text":"Excellent service, healthy portions, great selection of entrees and wines. Patio was quite enjoyable with portable heaters. Loved the salmon and artichoke risotto, chefs board appetizer and lemoncello desert."}
{"text":"I have to say I was disappointed. 

We arrived there on a weekend night. The staff were extremely nice. We were seated and served very promptly.

The service starts with delicious bread. It is served with a dip made of vinegar and oil. (no butter if you have to wonder, and we did not ask for some).

Cocktail drinks were great and again, we had the best service. Very prompt on refilling drinks, food and wine (they have a great wine menu).

The issue seemed to be the food. We first ordered mussels. They were cooked well, but were a little fishy. You decide.

The veal Milanese was very forgetful and and heavy. The way it was cooked must have hid the unique taste of veal. The others in the group had same issues with their meal.  

However, their sides are amazing. The sausage were to die for and their Kobe beef meat balls are also fantastic.

The atmosphere is classy and awesome. If I were to come again, I will stick with the sides :)"}
{"text":"I grew up in an Italian household and this place tastes like how mom used to cook. This is my favorite restaurant in old town. Minimal if any wait times, friendly staff and reasonably priced food. This is my top pick for sure."}
{"text":"Great dining on the patio.  Really good food, management with a sense of humor, and good wines as well.  Excellent oldies in the speakers rounds it off well.  Good value, too."}
{"text":"Great service. Awesome wait staff!  Food was good but a bit salty for my personal taste. Lobster bisque, short ribs, linguini with clams and the calamari  were delicious!  But the price is not $$. More like $$$"}
{"text":"We had the private dining room on Saturday for my birthday.  The food and service were absolutely phenomenal.  Everyone was extremely accommodating.  They created personalized menus for the occasion, which was a nice touch.  And wow- some of the best gnocchi I've ever had.  Scallops were terrific as well.  Oh, and do yourself a favor- try the fried burrata!  Thanks to the management and staff for making it a very memorable dining experience."}
{"text":"Waiter Johnny was very good.  Nice atmosphere and impressive wine selection.  App bacon wrapped prawns a must try.  Other then that I recommend the specials and taking the advise of your waiter.  This place is a safe and easy choice."}
{"text":"Great staff, good food, good wine options. If you are looking for a nice Italian place for a date night or nice family dinner I would give this one a try."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere. Fun place to go when you're looking to be a little upscale but not too high end. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Dinner last night was my first visit here and it totally rocked!  The risotto with shrimp is a \"must have\" if you're a shrimp or risotto fan.  My friend and I split the dish and they added an extra shrimp so that we would each have the same amount!!!!
Pear salad was great and the spaghetti and meatballs were awesome as well.  My boyfriend had the lentil soup and while I'm not a fan, he raved about it also!"}
{"text":"Take a minute to check out the wine in the cellar. Chef D. - awesome food. That tiramisu is pure heaven - and that Zoran guy, i wonder what you were waiting for - finally we have great restaurant and bar to spend some good time in. This bar offers refreshing happy hour meny to break that customary burger mold. Well, the sliders are there, but they are awesome."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced Italian restaurant in old town.  Great food, I got the shrimp rizzoto which was very creamy and delicious.  The setting inside is very modern. They have all of your favorite Italian dishes on the menu. Service was great, even had hot sauce for the rizzoto.  

There isn't one thing off of the menu that you need to get, but overall just a great restaurant with a good value."}
{"text":"Dropped in here after a day at Barrett-Jackson, and boy did we have a nice time.  Place was crowded on Saturday night but the hosts were able to find us a table with a minor wait   

Wine list was very good, but we opted for the strong drinks.  Salmon and risotto was very good, and the special meatballs and sausage were excellent as well.  

Service was prompt and courteous.  

Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great first time experience here. I'm only giving four stars because my scallops were overcooked, BUT our server (and trainee with him) didn't hesitate for a second to bring out new, deliciously cooked scallops to replace the chewy ones once I politely expressed my concern. That is fabulous customer service! I would do five stars for service but four stars for food since I did have to get new scallops...Great atmosphere  and ambiance as well. I will definitely be returning. They earned a repeat customer :-)"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to go to one of our favorite restaurants in Scottsdale when we decided to instead check out Yelp! for a restaurant we hadn't been to.  Tommy V's had some great reviews so we gave it a shot.  The place was hoppin' when we got there and only got busier as we had our dinner.   I started with the lobster bisque and was not disappointed.  There was plenty of diced lobster, not just essence of lobster. Then I had the filet which had a delicious flavor.  I had asked for medium well but it came back closer to rare.  I should have asked to send it back...the waiter did ask how it was...but I just ate it.  Very delicious.  And the sauteed spinach was a wonderful side dish.  My wife had the butternut squash ravioli and she thoroughly enjoyed that, too.  The restaurant is very open which made the busy place quite noisy.  That, I did not care for.  The service we received was some of the best I've ever had and that makes up for a lot.  Overall it was a good experience and I will absolutely go back again and will recommend it to my friends and clients."}
{"text":"We went here during Spring Training. We were going to the Giants night game and wanted dinner before hand. We parked in the parking garage at stadium and walked a few blocks to Resturant. The food and service was excellent . I had the salmon with risotto and it was very good. I would recommend this place before a night game come early they have happy hour and it is even discounted and they have an outdoor patio also. Perfect place anytime but before a night game much better. You don't have to eat stadium food and the restaurant is less expensive and relaxing..."}
{"text":"Tommy V's is such an authentic restaurant. The food was delicious. I ordered the fillet mignon and it was just about the best thing I ate that week!! The service is amazing. Our waiter was very professional (calling me and my friends \"miss\") and polite. The waiter was so nice, when I was shivering and covering my arms as it got cooler outside, without hesitation, he brought out a lovely heater for our table! We sat on the beautiful patio space in the corner next to these wonderful yellow flowers and it was heavenly. I have nothing but praises for this restaurant. I would recommend 10/10 times."}
{"text":"Great service, patio seating was very comfortable. Short ribs--awesome; pasta trio was really good and I had the side of homemade sausage to satisfy my inner carnivore. My boys both had linguine with clams and rated it as highly as their mom's:-) very nice wine selection with half bottle options. Martini was a bit watery. Still very enjoyable meal!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, especially dining outside on the patio on a nice night.  Food was delicious with good sized portions (especially the salads), and all was really quite reasonably priced.  Service was very good as well.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Pleasant enough place for dinner. The weather is perfect so sitting on the patio was very nice. The waiter we had was friendly and attentive.  I've been here before and have to say I was hoping that my food wouldn't be overly peppered again. Unfortunately is was, so I think this will be my last time. Not a bad place but not a great one either."}
{"text":"We were greeted with very friendly staff.  We had the fried knocci for an appetizer with a fabulous marinara sauce - usually do not order knocci but these came recommended and were very good.  The bread was crusty on the outside & chewy on the inside -very yummy.  We sat at the bar as we usually do and the bartender brought over a sample of their meet sauce to try with more bread.  I don't eat meat sauce but my husband said it was very good.  I had a heft cosmo & my husband had a beer.  For dinner i had the pasta trio that was fabulous - probably the best italian food i've had since the cioppino at Allesia's restaurant.  My husband had the linguine with white clam sauce also very good.  I'm certain these pasta dishes were homemade because they just had amazing flavor - I wanted more!! We finished with tiramisu that was also really great.  My husband had coffee and even that was great.  A little pricey in my opinion for italian food but due to how great all of it tasted -  we think it was worth it.  This will be a definite dining destination in the future."}
{"text":"Our family had a combined birthday/New Year's celebration here, and it was a near-perfect experience. There was a prix fixe menu for NYE with a great selection of dishes. Both of the savory dishes I ordered were pasta-based, and both were absolutely delicious. The pasta was definitely homemade -- an unexpected bonus! The dessert -- lemon almond torte -- was to die for. All the ladies at my table (myself included) also ordered the peach margaritas, which were really tasty. The service was great throughout the evening, and our waitress handled our party of nine with ease. The only complaint I have about the evening was the inside temperature -- it was freezing! We ended up leaving earlier than we would have liked because of it. I saw a review earlier complaining that the restaurant was too hot. Maybe there's some sort of insulation issue? Anyway, temperature aside, it was a great experience, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Great steak and seafood spot in Scottsdale. I visited last week while in town on business, and our waiter was outstanding. 

I thought the appetizers were average and the norm..we ordered Calamari and Mussels. Good, but nothing to write home about. However, my entree was very good. The wine was also fabulous...but what made the meal was the attention our waiter gave us...he was outstanding and I would go back just for him!"}
{"text":"The minute I walked in, I felt like an old friend. The owner was at the door and very welcoming! I sat at the bar, and when I realized that the menu offered nothing super healthy besides a salad, the bartender offered to customize a salmon dish for me with just salmon and veggies! What a nice gesture, and it went above and beyond my expectations. I travel extensively for work, and sometimes you just want something simple and familiar, and this place offered both. I can't wait to go back on my next trip, particularly for a splurge meal - the menu looked awesome!"}
{"text":"Was kinda torn about this place.  I travel a lot and see very nice versions of this sort of restaurant in various places.  Kinda trendy and open  with pseudo Italian fare.

The restaurant itself is nicely decorated, but some indications of just not being clean enough ...floors a bit dusty with some chunks here and there.

The food was interesting, but fell flat on flavor ...Caesar salad lettuce was fine, but they didn't have  anchovies ...said they were in the dressing ...ok, been told that before, but usual didn't bode well.  The dressing was very \"light\" ...without any hunt of warmth or anchovy.  Kinda blah.  The romaine wedge my wife had was nice, but same issue with blah dressing.

The Crostino Di Prosciutto we shared was great with suitable portion and flavorful bread and prosciutto.

Tommy's Amazing Homemade Pasta Trio was ok, but definitely not amazing .

I would like to have tried some classics but we weren't there for full dinner.

Throughout all, the server was excellent.

Net - Tommy may need to be on site more often ...perhaps get a tasting audience together and see what can be done with the basics.  No anchovy available for Caesar salad?"}
{"text":"Nice happy hour. Good service. The grilled cheese shortrib sandwich and calamari were excellent."}
{"text":"Bueno!

We had a very enjoyable experience at this restaurant. We didn't have a reservation but they had a high table available immediately for us which worked fine for us.

Bread and water were brought to the table promptly and a quick explanation of what specials were available that evening. Friendly welcoming staff is always a plus to me.

We had the kobe beef meatballs which tasted great but basically a meatball to me!

The manila clam linguine was very light tasting and you do get loads of clams. All in all, it was very easy to eat. If that's what you are after then you can't go wrong with this dish.

I had the veal which was also excellent. Complemented excellently with vegetables and mash. Yummy.

Thanks!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and wine value.  Not your traditional italian food, but a variety of food prepared in an italian style.  Large indoor and outdoor seating, as well as a sizable bar."}
{"text":"I stopped by Wednesday to see the new restaurant that was opening soon officially this Friday. OH-SO nice. The tables were spaced nicely and the bar is cozy. The great staff made sure I was well taken care of. I loved the menu selections. I shared an appetizer of gnocchi and anti-pasta, mmm. When I saw the shrimp risotto on the menu, I knew that would be my entree. So delicious and filling and yes left overs to savor the next day. They also have a great wine selection. Try the heavyweight red blend and discover a lost friend. It is my new GO-TO spot. See you there."}
{"text":"Such a great spot! The food is amazing plus they have many gluten free options! I can't wait to come back!! A must!"}
{"text":"Fantastic location, zero effort by the management....

I was appalled by what I saw in the \"kitchen\".  The pasta was from bags and microwaved; the salads were premade; the organic food is about as organic as my shoe.  The most casual observer can just sit at the bar and watch what the kitchen is doing, and it is busy, but 2 guys reheating stuff.
It is a shame, as the place looks great, but what a mess.  I sat; watched and left after finishing my drink.  I was going to ask the manager what the hell that was about; but he was apparently too busy with the table of women by the window.

One star for location
Minus one star for pasta sauce coming out of tin cans
One star for a fantastic patio
Minus one star for pasta from Fry's coming out of plastic
One star for great decor...

This could go on for days.... but I am hungry..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a nice atmosphere, great music/service, and one of a kind live jazz music, then Tommy V's Urban Kitchen & Bar is the restaurant for you. It's the perfect place to take your date and have a fun yet relaxing time. 

In addition, I must mention that the owner is one of the funniest guys I've ever met, and he'll make you feel at home. Regarding their food, I've been coming to Tommy V's for almost 10 months now, and their Italian dishes never ceases to amaze me. I love their chicken parm.

When I think about Italian restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale, Tommy V's Urban Kitchen & Bar is first to mind. It's my first recommendation for all my friends - hands down."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour with a friend tonight.  Food was good, risotto she had was amazing.  Good service, but soggy buschetta.  Pretty good wine for a decent price.  Customer service was a priority to all who were working.  I like it.  Cool atmosphere.
Bed time."}
{"text":"I cannot get over how AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS their seafood is. I haven't been able to get over it. Appetizer: Prince Edward Island Mussels. I don't think I will ever be able to be completely satisfied with other restaurants variations on Mussels for the rest of my life. The sauce was light, but so rich in flavor. Mmmm! I ordered the Manila Clams Linguine. Sooo tasty and a great transition from the mussels. The sauce wasn't too rich, and their clams were delicious (no surprise). I tasted the Zin Braised Short Ribs with the gnocchi, and it was great too. Do not hesitate, go now!"}
{"text":"It was empty on a Sunday night and almost did not go in because of that.     EVERYTHING was fantastic.   The Pasta trio was rich but so tasty, the Carbonara was full of flavor not just cream. Husband had the eggplant and butternut squash dish, it's so nice to have 2 different flavors on your dish rather than JUST the butternut squash, that would have been too rich.  The cheese used in the caprese salad was melt in your mouth and he Tiramassu was one of he best I've had."}
{"text":"Only reason the rating is falling short of perfection is mine could have been a few degrees warmer and my dads wish the smell the north side of the building was nonexistent (although we both understand that's pretty unavoidable. 

Service was spectacular and very attentive and the food had layers of flavor. 

I will definitely be back and will try another suggestion by the staff"}
{"text":"Great food, and excellent service!  Had an amazong filet and lobster tail....will repeat when in AZ again!"}
{"text":"Great place. I went for some drinks with friends after work the other evening and service was great. So were the cocktails! Try the margarita-style one!"}
{"text":"We hosted our rehearsal dinner here in June, and the service was exceptional.  The owner (manager?) Zoran met with us earlier in the week, and we were able to custom create our event menu with him.  The night of the event went perfectly.  As it is the slow season, he shut down half of the restaurant for us to hold a coctail hour, and as our 30 guests arrived, we shuffled into the banquet room. Everyone had a full glass the entire evening, the food was fantastic all the way around, and the service could not have been better.  They were especially attentive to our table (bride and groom and our families).  I'm no longer in the foodservice industry, but having served many years, I can say with confidence that Zoran and his crew have found the perfect balance of science and art in their large party service."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Excellent food. We sat out on the patio and we seated immediately on Friday at 7 pm. Our server was very attentive and gave suggestions for entrees and appetizers. The bread they give you was so delicious I ate a whole loaf myself. We also had calamari and i loved it. It was my birthday and they made me feel special by bringing my dessert. Tiramisu was delicious. We want to bring our friends here! Met the owner and he is a very nice guy."}
{"text":"A group of us went to Tommy V's Urban Kitchen & Bar on Friday night and I'm still salivating from all the deliciousness!! First impression with the host staff was top notch. We dined on their patio which was very comfortable and fun. Since we were a group we were able to try so many of their items off the menu. We started off with the Prince Edward Island Mussels, the Chef's Board and the MUST GET Crisp Pancetta Wrapped Prawns...all great! The Chef's Board was fantastic and great starter for a group to share. If you are only a few do not pass on the Prawns they were so AMAZING! We ordered a couple salads to share, the Pear Baby Greens was my favorite. We also shared a few entrees...the Pan Seared Diver Scallops - delicious! and the Citrus Shrimp & Lobster Ravioli...the ravioli was to die for! The service was spectacular, our server was a sweet heart and took photos of our Girls Night Out for us, he was very knowledgeable on the wines and recommended just the right things. Overall I highly recommend Tommy Vs...we all vowed to bring our husbands back!"}
{"text":"We couldn't have been more pleased with the service and the delicious food!! Loved everything about this place. Great way to end a day of strolling around old town Scottsdale. Perfect date spot!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time dining here, and I'm impressed! I'm a concierge which means I dine out a lot as part of my job, so I'm a bit of a guest/customer service snob, so I'm not easily impressed. The location was great and easy to get to. The atmosphere was nice. Not too dark of lighting which is good. I like to be able to read the menu and see what I'm eating/drinking. I would have liked maybe a different color scheme and more Italian art, but that played no impact on my review. Timoteo was our server. He was extremely knowledgeable, kind, friendly, and quick without making us feel rushed. That's important! Too many servers/waiters these days come off as annoyed by questions, wanting you to hurry up and tip them. But not here! We felt so welcomed and comfortable...like we were with family. In the same respect, the service was not intrusive either. A perfect balance. 

The food was delicious! Homemade bread to start was wonderful! Meat was perfectly cooked to order. Kudos to the kitchen staff! We loved how well Timoteo was able to make suggestions based on my indecisiveness. I just told him what I was in the mood for, and he said they could even combine the Filet and Penne with the Bolognese from a different dish! When it came time for dessert, he was fabulous once again with pairing our Tawny Porto with Tiramisu, and Moscato with Lemon Sorbet

Thank you Zoran for a wonderful restaurant, and to Timoteo for a wonderful experience! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Arizona and were looking for a place to eat on a Sunday night. We decided to check yelp to see what was good. This place obviously had great reviews, and was open on Sunday, so we decided to check it out.

I called and made a reservation for 9:30 pm. When we got there the place was basically empty, which wasn't that surprising for how late our reservation was and that it was Sunday, but we were greeted very enthusiastically and told we would have the best table in the house. We laughed about it since we were the only ones there.

As far as the food went, it was very good. We had the calamari for an appetizer. It was good, if I had a critique for it, it would be that the batter tasted a little over seasoned for my taste, but really was very good overall. My husband ordered short ribs, which he loved, but I didn't try them. I ordered the diver scallops which were amazing! I almost never finish a full portion for dinner, but these were so good I had to. Perfectly cooked, big, and topped with cheese. With a little pasta on the side. 

The the thing that really stood out about this restaurant for us though was the service. You would expect it to be good, because the place was empty, but the staff really went out of their way to make it an EXCELLENT experience for us. As an ex-server myself, I know when people walk in at the end of the night, it can be frustrating and its easy to kind of just get by with the bare minimum, but that wasn't the case here.

Our server Chris was amazing. He was friendly, witty, and very informative. He knew everything about each dish. When we asked about the restaurant he gave us the history, told us about the owners, and said he had been there since it opened and he loved it. He was very attentive all night. Then there was Jenn, she was the bartender and was at the bar across from the restaurant from us. When I couldn't decided what type of wine I wanted with my meal. She came to our table with samples of the two I was debating over. She told me where they were from, about their flavors, and what they paired well with. She even gave me a very generous portion of one that was the \"end of the bottle\" but if you ask me it probably could have been split between two glasses. I began to feel like I was at a wine tasting, as Jenn kept having suggestions for me or things I should try. But not at all pushing me to try things I didn't want or spending too much time at the table. At the end of our dinner, she even sent us over a desert wine. 

Overall the food and place were very nice. But it was the outstanding service that really made an unforgettable experience! Cant wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  One of my favorites when visiting the Scottsdale area.  Food is great and staff is wonderful.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We weren't hungry, so we split our meal. Our waiter was very helpful and provided excellent service. My lentil garbanzo spinach soup was wonderful. The spaghetti and meatballs were terrific, better than homemade. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. All of the staff are so welcoming and attentive! I had a fabulous evening. I ordered the Chilean sea bass and it was absolutely wonderful. Cooked well and the sauce was light and zesty. The sautéed spinach and potatoes were so tasty. Great band on fridays and saturdays too. Will be back again and again!!"}
{"text":"This is my first ever 5 star award!
Incredibly clean and comfortable bar with tvs. Great bartender, Angel, in addition to a fantastic menu. Lots of Vegetarian options! Yummy trio ravioli and also eggplant torts with butternut squash ravioli. The 1st sign the food would be amazing was their bread. Fresh, warm and perfectly cooked. Congrats to the chef for creating such great food and to the manager for creating a welcoming environment!"}
{"text":"My fiancee and I stopped in here during restaurant week. Good service, nice menu. Awesome mussels!! The food was great and the ambiance was nice, modern, clean, trendy. My fiance had the Pasta Trio and was in heaven. Good wine selection. The zucchini blossom appetizer was wonderful. If you're looking for a nice place to have a date, and aren't afraid to spend some money, I suggest Tommy V's!"}
{"text":"Can't remember what I got but it was on their dinner special, it came with Lamb, sausage, and chicken. The sausage was delicious but the lamb and chicken was a little dry. Their custard dessert was amazing."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and excellent service. Been twice and will be back many times.

Tried the eggplant and a pork special, both were divine. Try the lemon cello for desert, it's sublime.

A pricey meal, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Fabulously Friendly Staff and Exquisite Food.  I ate at Tommy V's last night, my first visit to this Italian restaurant.  I can't say enough about how friendly and knowledgeable the staff was.  Our waiter was helpful, patient, and a great source if you have any questions about the food menu or wine list... Very Friendly (we were there for almost 3 hours) I tried to order items I might not see on other local Italian menus, or looked for a new twist on ingredients and sauces.  I had the fresh anchovies for an appetizer - reminded me of Bocarones in Spain - Yummy and Fabulous.  My friend and I share the veal on the \"Special of the night menu\" and thank goodness we shared it.  The 1/2 was a complete meal and more.  It was done to perfections, great flavors.  Dessert - the lemon tart.  My friend choose this, I wanted the sorbet, but I went a long with tart.  I'm not an expert on tarts, I thought it was very good, but prefer a bit more sting to the tongue.  If you haven't been to Tommy V's, and you're thinking about it, Go!"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic experience! Hernan, our server was excellent. Knowledgable and charming. The food was fantastic. The chefs selection meat and cheese tray was insane. Crazy flavor. Well done!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch out on the patio today with co-workers. I ordered the caprese panino, which was a tad light on the meat, but was tasty. The tiramisu and canolis were great! Service was fast, very friendly, and more than supportive of us helping celebrate a co-worker's b-day. All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"Arrived on late Wednesday evening and my first impression was a very friendly host who sat my date and I outside on the patio per our request. Immediately after being sat three servers came up with silverware, plates and a lantern with a lit candle in it for a cute ambiance. The server, Tyler, was more than helpful and quick, apologizing when he thought he took too long which actually never was long at all. The food was amazing, from the balsamic and olive oil mixture for the bread to the amazing pasta and chicken Parmesan. We left the place in a relaxed, happy mood and a full stomach. I can't wait to go back and try more items."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great Italian food... And amazing chocolate mousse cake for dessert. I only wish they had creme brûlée. We will def be back. I got the shrimp risotto!"}
{"text":"Meh. Filet mignon was tough and undercooked. Polenta was grits, in fact I've had grits that were cooked better and tasted better. Atmosphere is weird, white table cloths but everything else is cheap and doesn't go together. Hope there are better restaurants in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We were not sure where to eat one night.  We stumbled upon Tommy V's and it was kismet.  The ambiance was relaxing.  Our server, Tyler, was spot on with his recommendation of the sea bass.  The butter sauce was unlike anything I have ever had.   And , of course, my partner thought he was very dreamy.  My partner had the Cappelini with tomatoes and herbs.   It was light and refreshing just as it should be.  
The owner stopped by to chat and was delightful.  We later saw him rearranging tables for a group.  It is reassuring to see an owner with hands on control.  
We will be back in Phoenix and when we are, we will make sure to come by again."}
{"text":"Never posted a review, but we had an excellent dinner at Tommy V's. Great ambiance, professional waiter who was there when needed but didn't hover, owner who visited table. Nice, well organized wine list and really nice menu. I had pasta trio which was excellent and husband had spaghetti and meatballs - he said probably best meatballs he has ever had. We split lemon pie. Delicious - not too sweet. Highly recommend.

{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Great atmosphere, and authentic cuisine. If you are ever in Phoenix you must stop in and try it for yourself"}
{"text":"The salmon was delicious!  Sat on the patio and enjoyed the food as well as the weather."}
{"text":"Ohmygosh yummy, ohmygosh yummy, ohmygosh yummy...  I went during the early evening happy hour time tonight and had a wonderful experience.  The acoustics aren't the best, and it can get pretty loud, but my friend and I had the time and space to have a long, leisurely conversation over some delicious food.  Though we were there for two hours (by choice) we never felt pressure to move on, and we had excellent service the whole time!

I had the beef carpaccio and the risotto with artichokes off the happy hour menu, and both were excellent.  And the portions were perfect for me - the carpaccio could have been shared with one other person if you were also getting a salad, soup, or another appetizer.  And the risotto was served in a 6-7\" soup bowl type of presentation - just the right size for a light meal.  It was filled with vegetables and big pieces of tender baby artichoke, and left me perfectly satisfied.

They even have gluten-free spaghetti and penne pasta - I'm definitely going back for that (and the lobster bisque!)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  This is my favorite new place in Old Town!! The food is fresh and high quality and the atmosphere is great. The decor is very modern and there is a large bar area. The appetizers were great...the Burrata was so tasty and the heirloom tomatoes were so fresh! I had the Manila Clam Linguini and it was amazing. My friends had the Seabass and it was perfect. This is the best Italian restaurant in Scottsdale! The desserts are to die for! I love this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A group of us from out of the state decided to try Tommy V
We were not disappointed.  The food was all delicious especially the pastas ( I had the great clam linguine)
The service was superb.  My husband made a mistake on his credit card bill - they fixed it right away.
Next time in town - will definitely stop by"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying  expected something a little funky at a urban kitchen.  

I was solo after a day of baseball and hard drinking.  I sat at the bar and was surprised to see the traditional menu offerings.  I asked the bar tender how the lamb chops were and he gave the big  
I asked for a salad with blue cheese and he suggested the blue cheese wedge.  MyGod, probably the best wedge salad ice ever had. Onions, bacon, tomatoes & of course blue cheese. Double 

I chose a Chilean Cab I wasn't familiar with and and asked the bartender how it was.  He said it was big and bold and would be great with the lamb. 

My God, the lamb was fantastic and the wine a great accompaniment to the this \"urban kitchen\" meal.  

Truly my new staple when visiting old town."}
{"text":"Visiting AZ and looking for some pasta for dinner. Nice ambience, good food. Spaghetti and meatballs were enjoyed by my kids. Salads were good portions and delicious."}
{"text":"Ate here on 4/5. Came over from shopping in Scottsdale and arrived early (6pm) without reservation. Were seated in the large outdoor patio. Offered both the dinner menu and the happy hour menu, which had limited selections. Ordered off both. Found both the service and food to be excellent. Had several glasses of an Italian red that was on the happy hour menu - very reasonably priced and quite good."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start.  This place has amazing food and service.  The look of this restaurant reminds me of European restaurants.  Not fussy,and the decor has clean lines.  Our waiter Luis was wonderful!!  Luis made a great wine suggestion and was able to answer all questions as this was our first visit.   We started with the chopped salad which twas split for us.  The homemade bread served with olive oil was warm and tasty.  The gnocchi 3 types - , brie, asiago cheese and mushroom with a brown butter sage sauce was pure unadulterated heaven!  The Bucatini Amatriciana was outstanding.  All the pasta's are organic and homemake.  We finished the evening with cannoli where were freshly made and very good.  Next time I am in the Scottsdale area I will be dining there again."}
{"text":"Eat at the bar.... Pasta was cold and staff was inattentive... Disappointing as it was rated so well."}
{"text":"This restaurant was delicious! I couldn't even pick one thing on the menu because everything looked so good! We tried the smoked salmon appetizer, the chopped salad, eggplant torte, and some spaghetti dishes, and all of them were great! The wine was also outstanding! Could be the best pasta in town! We just loved it there!!"}
{"text":"I made reservations for for a surprise bday dinner for my best friend. Her, her husband, my husband and myself got there and immediately loved the atmosphere. Fun, modern, wonderful live music ( Friday night). The food was delicious!! We ended up ordering off their specials menu that night! Pork Scallopini- tender, flavorful. NY Strip Steak- HUGE!  Juicy adn topped with an awesome cheese crumble (I cant remember what it was!) Mix Grill Plate- Sausage, Chicken and lamb chops. Lamb was cooked perfectly. The sausage was juicy and teh chicken was incredibly seasoned. Chilean Sea Bass- cooked to perfection. was flakey not fry. Perfect sear. 

We also ordered the chefs plate as an appetizer which is awesome for a table of 4. Delicious cheeses and meats. They also serve a bread basket with a olive oil and balsamic. 

Our server was amazing! She was attentive, friendly and always wanted to make sure we were doing ok. 

I informed the restaurant ahead of time about it being a bday dinner and Zoran arranged a piece of chocolate cake to our table. It was a nice touch. 

Love this place and will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for the first time as a last minute date night. We were able to make a reservation with no trouble. The staff was friendly. The calamari appetizer was great! I got the pasta trio, which was relatively simple and basic but not bland, and it hit the spot for me. Go when you are hungry, portions are decently sized (at least for a female!) :) we will be back!"}
{"text":"We brought a group of 10 for my brother's birthday. They reserved us a lovely table on the patio and even had custom, pre-printed menus with Happy Birthday Brandon printed on them! 

Server was very attentive and friendly and had even offered to split our check. I had the lobster ravioli with citrus shrimp.

I highly recommend Tommy Vs!"}
{"text":"People were nice owner is cool service is good but it poser fine dining. Not high class. The end."}
{"text":"We had family in from out of town, and it was a perfect spot.  We did not let them know we had a baby in a carrier with us, and they were extremely accommodating when it looked like there might be space issues.  Service was excellent as well, and when an item that was ordered did not come out right, he very quickly had the kitchen fix the issue.
The family talked about the dinner the entire next day as well and how delicious everything was."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch on our last day in Scottsdale.   Salmon was superbly prepared ..good winw and great service by Patrick.  Don't miss this place!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best values in Scottsdale. There are many places that are good to eat but the prices are so inflated that the value may not justify the visit.

Tommy Vs is great tasting italian food without breaking the bank.

I've even met the owner Zoron on multiple occassions and he's a very hands on and involved owner.

For lunch, their grilled beef tenderloin salad is best fare for eating with guests, coworkers, or if you decide to entertain clients. The perfect balance between fresh salad and juicy steak.

The Fettucuni Bolognese is also another great dish with made from scratch sauces. 

I've been going here for over a year with my family, friends, and clients and have never been disappointed once. Oveall just a great place."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian food! One of my Scottsdale favorites, Tommy V's has a great staff, wine list and consistently delicious food. Love the new fried Burrata and the calamari is a must. They also have a good happy hour menu with small plates to share. They do live music on the weekends- great spot for a date or night out with friends!"}
{"text":"Have a co-worker in from Denver-has read my blog and wanted to take another co-worker and wife to dinner.  I suggested Tommy V's.  We went last night and Chef Doug out did himself again!  Amazing.  

We ordered a bottle of Nativa Carmenere Reserva, Curico Valley, Chile **Organic and Crostino Di Prosciutto Toasted bread capped with prosciutto & melted mozzarela sprinkled with fresh sage and Mozzarella Caprese Fresh Mozzarella, Vine-Ripened Tomatoes, Basil, EVOO Drizzle to start.  AMAZING!!!  SO YUMMY!!

For dinner 3 of us had the Grilled Shrimp Risotto Corn, Preserved Lemon and Snipped Herbs and 1  had Tommy's Amazing Homemade Pasta Trio - Tortelli Wild Mushroom, Portobello Mascarpone, Ravioli Spinach Ricotta Truffle and Gnocchi, Brie, Asiago Cheese, Brown Butter Sage Sauce.

And for dessert we had the limoncello sorbet and the chocolate tartufo.  

Chef Doug - you are truly a rockstar!  Love, love, loved dinner last night!
Thank you again for coming out and chatting with us.  You know I just like getting you out of the kitchen ;)


Can't wait to go back with the girls and do a girls night out!"}
{"text":"This place would have been five stars but I feel that it is a little on the pricy side. The food is good and the service is great, I just feel like you should get more for your dollar."}
{"text":"Had the most fantastic dinner and service last night with my wife and friends at Tommy V's Urban Kitchen.  Our waiter, Robert, was excellent and the owner Zoran was attentive and very friendly.  Our dinners were fantastic.   I had the halibut and my wife had the Chilean bass.  Both dishes were delicious and beautifully presented and served at prefect serving temperatures.  The fingerling potatoe sides were also wonderful and the beet salad that my wife and shared was delicious.  My friend who loves short ribs ordered them and raved about how good they were - generous portion also.  All in all, one of the best local dinners we've enjoyed in Scottsdale in quite some time and at a price that won't empty your wallet.  Will go again soon.  My wife and I have attended two wine tasting dinners at Tommy V's previously and they we're also excellent -with very generous pours.  Do yourself a favor and check to see when Zoran will next host another wine tasting dinner and bring some friends- you'll be sure to enjoy.

{"text":"This place is beautiful, great patio with classic decor.  Went to Happy hour...of course and had a few glasses of wine and  yummy calamari.  Service was off the charts!  We were sitting on the patio...a little hot and Schwetty...and the server kept moving the umbrellas to shade up as the sun set...WOW!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food and attentive but not stuffy service. The carpaccio appetizer was delicious, top 3 that I've had. The Caesar salad was creamy and garlicky goodness. Both spag and meatballs and the Bolognese were prepared well in a traditional way, simple but delicious. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This is going to focus on the service. The food... Just like any restaurant nothing special. But the service is the worst in Scottsdale. Came for a mothers day with mother in law and kids. Over an hour and a half for one piece of food. Over 30 min for the kids to get a soda. While the horrible waiter was finally taking the order he left in the middle of taking it to talk to another Sever. The owner/manager should really start to care about his restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, but each time I go I seem to enjoy it less. Last time I was there, I ordered the mussels and they were extremely over cooked and a very salty broth. My husband got the pasta trio and didn't like that there was no separation between them and that the sauces all ran together. There was so nothing impressive about any of the the three pastas. They were fresh, but very mediocre. Considering the price point and location, I expect more from Tommy V's. 

I am not sure if we will be going back here unfortunately, which is disappointing as it used to be a very good experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I attended the wine pairing dinner last Thursday evening and could not have enjoyed ourselves more. From the moment we arrived to the time we left, the professional staff truly delivered in making certain our night would be memorable. The wine was outstanding and paired nicely with each of the five courses. Thanks to our servers Tyler, Patrick and Kevin for your attentiveness and attention to detail when describing the wine notes. Also to Zoran for sponsoring such a fun event. We encourage everyone to go to the next one."}
{"text":"The setting is beautiful and it's a great place to bring guests from out of town. The food was good but not spectacular. The service was not as attentive as I would have liked - maybe the server was having an off day. I will try Tommy V's again."}
{"text":"Food was great and service was even better. my wife had the pear salad which she highly recommends! The pasta is deliscious, fresh, and sauces were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The patio has a terrific view of old Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is SUPERB! It literally deserves a
standing ovation. The food is so delicately presented and the flavor in everything is so unique! The eggplant parm is probably one of the best I have ever had. Portions are immense and pricing is extremely affordable - let's just say, id pay more! My friend spilt her wine glass and got it on her white top and within a minute the waiter came running over with a wine remover spray bottle that worked - I didn't even know there was such a thing, it was pure magic. The waiter was that on top of things, he didn't miss a beat. I don't usually write reviews but I just had so much fun I had to share my experience. Definitely a must go! Thanks Tommy V!"}
{"text":"I booked a table for a party of 8 with one of our party needing gluten free choices. I got a call the night before our dinner from the owner who called to assure me that they would make sure every need was met. It was. The food was great. The service was not only great but fun as well. I would recommend this place to anyone who asked."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. They have a somewhat small menu, but the food is great. The rest of my party enjoyed it too, even a couple who are hard to please. Server was very nice and quick on the service"}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful service every time I've been there. Eggplant Torta is my favorite---well there's also the Grilled Shrimp Risotto, but I can't forget the Pasta Trio. Hmmmm...so much delicious food at Tommy V's, and so little time."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, when our group of Downtown Ambassadors met here last night. Plenty of room for our twenty people and no loud music to stop our conversations. I had the Kobe beef on pancakes listed on the Happy Hour menu, which incidentally lasts from 11:30 a.m. To 6:00 p.m. It was excellent and tasty. Good selection to choose from."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful treat after a long day. We were visiting the area for a half ironman event.   After a long day of racing we were looking for  a nice place for dinner.    Tommy V's didn't disappoint.   Nice ambiance and great food was delivered.   My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs and the meatballs were great and went well with the marinara sauce.   I had the pasta trio and I loved every bite. Thanks for the great post race dinner."}
{"text":"A rare miss yelpers.

The restaurant is is nice on the inside, and has a very cordial staff. The service is executed well, although food and beverage knowledge was lacking. The worst part was the food. The Chefs Board appetizer advertised a chef's selection of meats and cheeses, but  turned out to be a grocery store sampler. The beet salad was really a mixed greens salad with a side of depressed beets; hardly enough to name the salad after it. The chopped salad had the same dressing as the beet salad, wasn't chopped, and was poorly constructed. The \"Housemade organic pasta\" selections sounded excellent, but one dish was worst than the next. The shrimp risotto featured dried shrimp on top of overly-peppered, dried out risotto. The chef's trio of pasta was mediocre. Had to pass on dessert given our experience so far.

I Yelp a lot, but dont write many reviews. I spent two days in the Phoenix area, and looked up all of my dining choices on Yelp. I went to The Arrogant Butcher downtown for dinner(fantastic) and Vovomeena for brunch(also fantastic). This place, however, does not deserve 4 1/2 stars. I wish I had my $90 back."}
{"text":"As a fan of Italian food I had to try this place. It's actually my third time the past 3 years. I got to say that the taste never fails although dishes are small and the price is high 20$ for a ravioli. I guess if you get meat you get a better value for your $. Any way probably be back in a year when I crave fancy Italian food.  
Great service !"}
{"text":"Our first trip to Scottsdale and we hit all the high points for restaurants. This was the pinnacle! My spouse and I had a fabulous lunch and we wish we had gone here for supper! 

The food was so FRESH! The house salad was exceptional with baby greens that had been harvested recently! The dressing is light but SO flavorful! 

My husband ordered the scallops...WOW! They were totally rocked with freshly made gnocchi and steamed arugula and fresh asparagus! 

I had the eggplant torte and butternut squash tortellini which was 'knock your socks off' spectacular! The squash tortellini had the perfect amount of nutmeg and something else that I couldn't put my finger on...it was truly spectacular!

And not to dis the bread but the olive oil is a sweet one...it could be drunk right out of the bowl!

If given the opportunity, Tommy Vs is definitely worth visiting for a fresh creative meal in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We dine at Tommy V's every year while visiting spring training. The food is excellent and plentiful, service and drinks were also great, and the patio dinning is lovely on a spring night. This year we especially enjoyed three different pasta dishes."}
{"text":"This was the worse dinner I have had in many years! Waiter was cranky to start...and very impatient. Not all helpful

The Chicken Parm was a bleached out piece of bagged, frozen  Costco chicken, microwaved and covered in a bland herb tomato sauce that was so far from authentic even the most basic jar of sauce would have tasted better.  The chicken was like chewing on a piece of rubber.  The sauce lacked any flavour. The pasta had obviously sat in a pot for hours before running hot water over to heat it.  I asked for additional Parm cheese.  The waiter grabbed a bowl from the another table, he sprinkled it on only to find out it was  not real cheese, but the Kraft out of tin type made to look authentic by putting it in a bowl. 

The waiter was somewhat impatient when we needed a bit more time to order. The lighting on the patio was horrible...one tea light at the table! The patio is essentially in the parking lot...as we were eating dinner, a car was shining its lights in our eyes...(at least we could see the menu).  My husband order the pan seared Mahi Mahi and you seriously couldn' t if it was chicken or pork but it definitely didn't taste like fish AT ALL (in the good sense).  

Don't waste your money....a beer, a glass of white wine and two entrees $70 and it was not worth a single penny.  In a town where there is no shortage of fine restaurants at reasonable prices, this one needs to close its doors."}
{"text":"I'm Italian so I know great Italian food. The Chicken Parm with linguine and Alfredo sauce was absolutely amazing. Great ambiance and service. This is my new spot when I come to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Don't really get why this place is so highly rated.  Yes, the food was good- but nothing was great.  The service and the ambiance were just ok.  Oh well- every once in a while I don't agree with the majority of Yelpers."}
{"text":"AMAZEBALLS, AWESOME SAUCE, etc.!! This spot is truly a culinary delight. I had the Limoncello Martini...to live for, the Beet Salad...to die for, and the Pork Scallopini...to be resurrected for."}
{"text":"I came to Tommy V's on Sunday night. The wait staff was nice and got is seated quickly. The atmosphere inside is like a relaxed classy. The staff is attentive with drinks. I started with the calamari which was crispy with a chunky marinara sauce. I ordered the pasta trio. I found it quite enjoyable with the mushroom ravioli being my favorite.  One of my dining mates ordered something off menu full of linguini and seafood. Although the scallops were a little overcooked it was still tasty. The chicken parmigiano was some of the best I've had. The short ribs were a little dry without the sauce. Overall the food was delicious and worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Super Delish !!!  The ribeye was perfect to share for 2 and the lemon Cello sorbet is a MUST !!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The waiters were really nice and the food got there super fast.  Great ambiance, and generous portions.  Was very hard to exhibit restraint and not eat every last bite even though we were quite stuffed!  Nice outdoor seating areas too for those beautiful desert nights."}
{"text":"Ate outside the weather was perfect as was the service. Great wine list, good by the glass selections. Try the pasta selections...fettuccine bolognase was special."}
{"text":"Ok, I screwed up.  Set up a business meeting for four people at 7pm at Tommy V's without a reservation on St. Patty's day (I forgot about it, along with forgetting to wear anything green) and during Cactus league/spring training in Scottsdale, Arizona. (From bad to worse.)  

What did the manager do at Tommy V's? He found me a great table on the awesome patio and was gracious about it.  Just for that wonderful accommodation alone would be enough...but hold up!  The food was excellent (the eggplant, wow!) the wine and beer selection was great (kick ass happy hour prices) and the service was outstanding (thanks Tyler.)  

This was my first time here along with one of my four guests and we all really had a nice time...and don't forget it was a business meeting!  I am looking forward to going again if my experience ends up being like my last gig, it'll be worth it."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. I always order the \"healthy plate\". It is two amazingly flavorful breasts of chicken with an assortment of veggies. It's delicious, healthy and great service!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend for a late lunch.  the service was friendly but slow. Be prepared for a leisurely meal. We ordered the Panzanella Salad and the Artichoke Risotto. Both were tasty. We had ordered the tenderloin on the salad to be cooked medium rare. It came out closer to medium well. Despite that, the meat was still tender and well seasoned. The risotto was flavorful, and I liked the taste of the corn mixed in, but I wish there was more artichoke on there. I took a peak at the happy hour and dinner menus. I'd definitely like to check out some of those items too."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service was excellent.  Chicken Parmesan, mussels, and lobster linguini was fabulous."}
{"text":"Perhaps we hit an off day.  Stopped in for lunch.  Maybe 15 to 20 people in the restaurant.  We were seated quickly, brought bread and water, and placed our orders.  Our Caesar salads arrived quickly.  The salad was fresh and tasty.  So far so good.

We finished our salads and water and sat there for about another 15 minutes before a server came by and refilled our glasses.  Another 15 minutes went by and 2 of the 3 dishes we ordered arrived.  The vegetable risotto had good ingredients and the rice was cooked just right, but overall it lacked much in the way of flavor.  It needed more salt, better stock, or some kind of punch.  The eggplant torte was delicious and the sauce was even better.  Eventually, the sausage that was forgotten arrived.  The sausages were pretty scorched and had very little juice left, but the meat inside had good flavor and the marinara sauce was decent.  Nobody ever came back to refill our water glasses again and I dying for some.  When one of the servers finally came back we just decided to pay our bill and get back on the road.

Overall, the dishes were a hit and miss and the service was very spotty despite the fact that there was hardly anyone in the restaurant.  Not sure what all the fuss is about, but I'm guessing we just hit it on a bad day."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places to dine.. Very culinary oriented and well run by a single owner.. Dishes were well portion and delicious... Tim took great care of us showing a great fine dinning experience.. The lobster fradiablo was amazing..!!"}
{"text":"It was our last night in town and Mom wanted to take us out for a nice dinner. After pouring over listings of dozens (maybe hundreds!) of restaurants, we decided to try Tommy V's.  It turned out to be a very good choice.  We ordered the Santa Cristina Sangiovese 2009 for our wine selection, which was excellent (looking at reviews of this wine, some really liked it, others said ho hum.  We were very pleased with it, maybe it has improved over the past 6 months?).  From there, we each tried a different salad.  All three of them (Caesar, Wedge, and Chopped) were excellent.  My wife and I both had the Tommy's Amazing Homemade Pasta Trio of home made pastas, which were very flavorful.  I cold have eaten a couple more each of the tortelli and ravioli for the price, but the flavor of each of the three (spinach ravioli, portabella tortelli and brie/asiago/butter-sage gnochi) was absolutely excellent.  Mom had the shrimp and risotto, which was also excellent.  We finished off sharing the canoli, which was good, and some espresso.  Overall, the service was attentive (VERY important to me), our waiter, Hernan, was a really great guy and provided friendly, excellent service.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Based upon almost universal positive Yelp reviews, I had very high expectations for Tommy V's and was unfortunately disappointed.  The food was good, ambience was lovely, service was a tad slow but very earnest (he was very busy running around from table to table).

The best dish of the night?
grilled asparagus side - very good, tender and flavorful
anchovy, olive appetizer - good and tasty
pepper, cured meat plate - not bad, but doesn't taste like it is house-cured (wish it were)

The entrees? A bit of a disappointment
Spaghetti with meat balls - this was the best dish. I think the pasta could be a little more al dente but the sauce was tasty and the meatballs were very tender. But \"better than Mom's\" - I think that is a stretch.

Clams with Linguini - big disappointment. The dish comes piled with clams, but they are of the canned variety. The dish overall lacked flavor - could have used more olive oil, red pepper, garlic, clam flavor. Also could have used some parmesan cheese

Pasta Trio? The sage butter pasta was the best. The gnocchi was gummy - but isn't that what it always tastes like? (as you can see, not a big fan of gnocchi in general).

The short ribs - meh, I have had much better. Very tender, but the sauce could have used a bit more red wine reduction and less salt.

Cannoli dessert - okay (I've had better)

Tiramisu - a bit too sweet for my liking.

Pistachio ice cream was interesting, it was a log of pistachio ice cream coated with crushed pistachio nuts and chocolate then sliced and presented in slices on a plate."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Real fun and lovely place with great service and fantastic Italian/Mediterranean food and more."}
{"text":"Always a top meal every time and reasonably priced! Ive had nothing but exceptional service and food.  I have had the gnochi and short rib, veal chop, seafood special pasta and linguine with clams...all amazing.  A must try for all people!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! I made a reservation for a birthday celebration for 12 girls. I called and asked about dropping off some balloons & a few other things to be placed on the table before we arrived and my request was accommodated...how great! The fig mule was delicious and T, our waiter, knew his wine! His recommendations were spot on for the wine drinkers. The food was yummy and the portions were just right! If you have a special celebration I recommend Tommy V's!!"}
{"text":"I went here after reading other yelp reviews and I'm sad to say that the $90 meal my honey and I had was one of the worst ever. The ambience is great, but the plate presentation and flavors were non existent. We ordered the trio plate with the three pasta and it was disappointing to say the least. The only positive I can say is the mussels were decent. I will not go here again and highly recommend checking out other restaurants around the area before paying for an overpriced tasteless meal."}
{"text":"We went there for a business dinner, so was a group of 5.  I ordered the recommended dish, Shrimp/Lobster with squid ink pasta.  The presentation was great but the lobster was tough and the shrimp and scallops lacked flavor.  My wife got a shrimp risotto dish and the risotto wasn't creamy or flavorful.  Service was great and so were the drinks and appetizers, however most of us had the consensus about the food lacking flavor that night.  Maybe this is a one-off since the restaurant had great Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"Went in for a group business dinner. Excellent place, nice ambience, attentive people... the waitress's intro made me feel like I was in a military mess but in a good way. Food was ok, service was timely. Would definitely recommend it of you're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great food, but more importantly, great people. We were late for our reservation because everyone knows you don't wake a sleeping baby. They were so accommodating. It was my bday, and the desert was awesome!!! So was the entire meal. Host, owner and server were all really kind! Reminded me of so many cool little Italian joints back home in Chicago."}
{"text":"You need to eat here!  Wow!  Great everything.  From Tommy himself who greeted us, to Kevin who was our most excellent server to the unspeakably delicious food!  We called at 6:30 on a Saturday night and asked if we could be seated if we were arriving in 20 minutes.  Tommy answered the phone and told us that with Barrett Jackson and the Rock n Roll marathon in town it was doubtful, but we could most likely sit at the bar. He however took our name anyway. When we arrived, and gave him our name, he greeted us with a smile and took us straight to our table. From there, Kevin took excellent care of us, accommodating all of our special requests with a smile. The food was excellent. I had a wonderful spinach salad (which was not on the menu, but Kevin didn't even blink at my request) And chicken piccata. Both were unique and delicious. My husband had a Tuscan pork chop with spicy spaghetti. It was the best Pork chop he has ever had. We will most definitely visit Tommy V's again in the future."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant! Great service - the staff was amazing and very attentive! A group of 12 of us came in to celebrate a friends birthday. They were very accommodating, allowed us to bring in a cake and brought it out at the perfect time (suggesting that they were observant and mindful). We called in the reservation and explained we would be needing separate checks, they made this process very smooth. 

It's an Italian restaurant, and I'm used to Italian food having more flavor. The dishes on the menu sounded amazing, however, for my personal taste the food was a bit bland. I had the Lobster and Shrimp Fettuccini, the seafood was cooked just right but the sauce for the fettuccini did not have much flavor. Bread smelled delicious and tasted great (feels like it was freshly made). Good selection of wines. Because of the exceptional service I may be giving this place another try."}
{"text":"nice place. 
Cream potato soup! It's amazing! I really recommend it! But it's on the today's special menu."}
{"text":"Decent place for dinner. Even some live jazz piano in the background to add to the ambiance. For a good italian dinner worth the trip."}
{"text":"We went here for a dinner party last Saturday.  I enjoyed the modern, clean atmosphere and the food/wine/service was outstanding!  Our waiter was knowledgeable, friendly, and gave excellent recommendations (he kind of reminded me of an adult \"Manny\" from Modern Family ~ so I took an instant liking to him)! 
I enjoyed my Prosecco with the Burrata Caponata, Prosciutto, House-Cured Olives.  Seriously - when is Burrata ever wrong?  Delish!  
I was also excited to see the Goat Cheese & Basil Stuffed Squash Blossoms on the menu and ordered those as well.  My only complaint was that they were deep fried - I thought that a light tempura would have been better to enhance the flavors and the presentation.  

Our friends ordered The Chef Board Artisan Meats and Cheeses, Olives, Grilled Artichoke, Caponata this was excellent and enough for 4 people to share.  The Pork Oso Buco Tomato Wine Sauce, was also a hit!  My favorite of the night was the Mushroom Hazelnut Risotto.  It was so good and SO rich that I could not finish it!  

We ended our evening with one of the owners bringing us some complimentary Guapa and limoncello shots.  This complimented our tiramisu dessert!  Also - check out the happy hour menu!  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Came to Scottsdale for a fun week of San Francisco Giants Spring Training and strolled by here for an early dinner. Even with no reservation we were seated promptly outside (great weather!) Our waiter was Kevin. Very professional. He was right there with a basket of fresh and fantastic oven-warm bread plus olive oil and balsamic vinegar to dip, he brought our drinks order promptly and was available to answer any questions. We enjoyed two of the house salads (very fresh, very substantial and great house dressing!) then hubby had the evening's special of meat lasagne and I had the beautifully served pasta trio with a glass of Stone Cellars Cab. The entire evening came to $70. Well spent and enjoyed. This is a classy place conveniently located in Old Town and we will be back next year!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were outstanding.   Went for restaurant week. The butternut squash ravioli was outstanding.   The zin short ribs were zinful.   Made the wrong choice for desert,  had berries and cream that was good, but lemon torte was fabulous.  

 For a high end restaurant was disappointed on the wait staff.  When plating they would cross over in front of someone's face, my favorite as someone was taking a bite they would reach over to take someone's plate.  Had to ask repeatedly to refill drinks and bring out an extra place setting.   

That is the only reason for the four because the wait staff is an easy fix but the food, definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with my husband. I got the eggplant which was yummy, he got chicken Marsala and it sucked. It was bland with nothing special. We also ordered the prawns for appetizer, they were ok and wrapped in bacon. We each ordered a glass of wine and bill was $90. Not bad.. so overall not best italian but doable. People who worked there were nice and service was good :)"}
{"text":"I've only been to Tommy V's for lunch with co-workers.  It was completely empty on a Thursday afternoon during lunch time ... 12 on the dot.  It's an expensive lunch date so I understand.  All of us (6 of us) ordered salads.  5 of us ordered the chicken cobb salads.  My goodness the grilled chicken cobb salad was delicious.  I believe the salad dressings are house made and they're really good.  One of us ordered the ahi tuna salad.  It was smaller than ours, way smaller but the flavor was out of this world.  If dining on a corporate dime, check out Tommy V's for lunch."}
{"text":"Their eggplant and the bread was amazing, fresh, and tasty. The food are sized reasonably. I will definitely come back for more pasta."}
{"text":"Seeing how the average rating of this place is 4 1/2 stars and I'm only giving it one star, makes me slightly reconsider my rating for a second -  am I just a super picky a-hole or is everyone else missing the queue here?  I'm going to go with the latter, although I'm going to say right now that my rating is based off of what we ordered.

Came here for a big group birthday dinner, and I must say, the staff was very accommodating and patient.  That's half a star.  

Now on to the food - 

I ordered the pasta trio and the boyfriend ordered the clams linguine.  

Pasta trio - Basically a sample plate of three different pastas ( tortelli, gnocchi and ravioli.)  I wasn't expecting Lake Michigan portions, but I also didn't think my meal would be bite sized.  I'm not even exaggerating  - $19 dollar plate to feed an infant.  And it was mediocre.  I'd rather pop open a can of CHEF BOY R D and squirt some Sriracha on top.  

Clams Linguine - If you want to know how this tastes and you happen to live near near the ocean, jump in it and swallow the water - and try to get some clams in there too if you can.  The dish was sodium overload, although clam count was abundant.  

I'd rather eat at Olive Garden.  Yeah it's a chain and it's not hip and trendy and lots of  old people frequent it, but its a safe bet vs paying 50 + for a meal and then paying another 15 for Filibertos cause you leave starving, still."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but have to give it a 4 because of how long I waited for my food (honestly it was close to an hour). I started off with the beef carpaccio, which was great, but then I had it sitting in front of me for 45 minutes until someone finally came to take it away and bring my next meal, which was a pasta dish. I ended up asking for it to go. Would definitely come back but had a strange first experience."}
{"text":"Honestly, the worst Italian food we have ever had. The meat balls were the equivalent of a ball of spam with a marinara that tasted like it was right out of a can. The Bolognese was a salty mess, no flavors of a Bolognese at all. The beet salad, was a mound of greens with some beets tossed in with a small slice of a round of goat cheese. 
I'm sorry to have to post something so negative. We had high hopes for this restaurant, but three dishes out of three that were frankly awful, I have no choice."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner last night. Staff was very professional and accommodating.  We had the NY Strip and short ribs, both we're excellent and the portions were very good. Bread was amazing, also had tenderloin carpaccio as an appetizer. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food excellent!!  Fantastic service!  Waiter Tanino was friendly, attentive, and helpful making dinner choices. Every restaurant should have a server like him."}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day, wanting to try a new place. Based on so many good Yelp reviews, expected it to be busy. Kind of frightening that there were only four others in the restaurant when we arrived at 4 pm and not many more by the time we left. 

First thing I noticed was caked on food on my fork. Also on my son's fork. AND on my other son's forks. The waiter didn't really seem concerned other than saying something about nobody polishing that section. Uh, how about WASHING?? 

Because we drove across town and it being Mother's Day, it didn't seem feasible to go elsewhere, or we would have. We stuck it out and dinner was very good. We had the carpaccio and a seafood/pasta appetizer, chicken parm and chicken piccata. Nothing left on our plates. The pasta portion of each dish was skimpy, which was disappointing because we were looking forward to homemade pasta. 

If we are in the area, we'll probably try it again."}
{"text":"We had a great dining experience here and will definitely be back to try out some of the other items on the menu.  We stopped in on a Tuesday night and despite the fact that the place was nowhere near full, the bar area seemed a bit loud so we asked to be seated on the other side of the restaurant where things were a bit quieter.  We started off with the lobster bisque, which is one of the better lobster bisques that I've had.  It wasn't overly creamy and the addition of sherry added a nice flavor.  It's certainly pleasing to find that there are in fact actual pieces of lobster in the bisque rather than just an overall seafood flavor.

For our entrees, I ordered the pasta trio which consisted of wild mushroom tortelli, spinach ricotta truffle ravioli and gnocchi with brie, asiago, and a brown butter sage sauce.  The tortelli was my favorite of the three items, however, all of them were made with high quality ingredients and were made in a true Italian style.  I would have preferred if the sauces were more flavorful, but even as is, the items were still good.  My husband had the eggplant torta with butternut squash ravioli and of course, I had to sample both items on his plate as well.  I really didn't care for the butternut squash ravioli as there was an overwhelming taste of brown sugar, but the eggplant torta was my favorite of anything we'd ordered.  It was served more as an eggplant lasagna than a typical torta and the flavors were excellent.  The eggplant was tender but not mushy and the sauce and cheeses were wonderful.  

The service was excellent and the owner introduced himself and was very friendly throughout the meal.  The wine list also offered many good options at a variety of price points.  This place was a great find and we'll be back soon to enjoy more of the menu."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant the service was top-notch the food was amazing love the ambience great location. I had the seared salmon with baby green salad and everything was cooked perfection. Also tried a chefs board and that was very well prepared and delicious."}
{"text":"What a delightful place with food to match. Try the bruschetta. The mac and cheese!  The bolognese!!  And I personally loved the capellini--simple, well-prepared and delicious!!!  I wish I could remember the waiters name but he has a pony tail and was fun and prompt."}
{"text":"This place saved my birthday! Accommodated group of 8 of us last minute at peak hours on a Saturday night! From the moment we walked in the door seeing the high class ambiance to the last moment when the owner of the restaurant herself walked us out and took our picture, this place exceeded every expectation! Blown away by the kind, hospitable, patient, and attentive service we received. Warm bread on the table, sumptuous pasta dishes. Loved the rigatoni with garlic cream sauce! Delicious chocolate martini! Tasted my friend's pasta trio which was good. Tends to be pricey with moderate too small portion sizes but they have some ranges of options including a wedge salad with yummy bleu cheese dressing. Food, service, and ambiance made it worth it! They even played a sweet birthday song for me across the whole restaurant! Loved my experience and will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"We had exceptional service from Patrick at Tommy V's when we took our friends there for dinner on the way to a cultural event nearby. We were promptly seated at a pleasant patio table and Patrick immediately jumped into action when we explained we were eating on a deadline. 

He helped us make menu choices that could be served quickly, took our orders to the kitchen, and attended our every need during the meal. Our guests from St. Louis loved Tommy V's. The food was delicious, the service was excellent, and we did not feel pressured or rushed at any time. 

Recommended dishes from that evening were pasta picchio pacchio, shrimp with risotto, eggplant parmesan, and chicken marsala. Patrick also made wine recommendations that we liked very much. 

Our thanks to Patrick for getting our evening off to a perfect start. He's a great new addition to the staff at Tommy V's."}
{"text":"I guess I'm in the minority, but I really wasn't terribly impressed with Tommy V's.  Based on the reviews, I picked this restaurant to celebrate my Birthday, but was pretty disappointed in the overall experience.  The restaurant itself is cute enough, big, with a rather benign vibe.  It wasn't too crowded on the Friday we went, and we were seated in a corner.

We started off with some appetizers.  I had the fried burrata, which I found to be pretty darn good.  Nothing crazy, but simple and nice.  For dinner I had the spaghetti carbonara.  Let me start off by saying I LOVE CARBONARA.  I get it for special occasions often.  This carbonara tasted mostly of pepper.  It was so overwhelming, I couldn't taste the pancetta or anything else.  I also wasn't a fan of the squash in it (something I hadn't seen before).

At the end, the waiter did bring me a dessert, for my birthday, but unfortunately it was chocolate mousse, which isn't something I enjoy.  Alas, it's ok because I was mostly turned off at that point anyway. I found the service here to be pretty good, especially because our waiter put up with all of us.  

All in all, I'm not sure if I was wowed enough to come back, but I also wouldn't not come back.  We shall see what the future brings..."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and ambiance is chic and modern. Everything is clean and prim without seeming to hoity toity. 

The services was great

The food however...sub par. I'm not into rating a place amazing based on how cool or \"hip\" it is. I'm 27, my BF 43...we like good food but don't have ridiculously high expectations either. I convinced my BF to come here after reading the reviews. He had the Tommy's Amazing Pasta Trio and I had the chicken piccata. The food was honestly a little above that of a frozen dinner. The trio was bland and not very flavorable. My piccata was paired with a red pasta ziti and a steamed vegetable medley. The lemon sauce seemed like it was made from a gravy packet...

It wasn't HORRIBLE, but it wasn't great it was average, with a price tag. Not that price is an issue, but our meal was $100 with tip and we left feeling let down...my sparkling wine was the highlight of my dinner sadly. Also, they do not carry coors or miller light...but they carry budlight. 

We also had the steamed mussels for an app...we usually get steamed clams, but those weren't on the menu. We aren't huge fans for fishy flavor, and these tasted like eating a bite of ocean water...not sure if that's how mussels are suppose to be or not.

Anyway that's our experience and take...I wouldn't go back sadly..."}
{"text":"Just dropped in for a late dinner on 4/5/18. Greeted and seated quickly. Ate outside in beautiful weather. Friendly service by Lydia and good food. A little pricey but this is Scottsdale during spring break season. Would stop in again."}
{"text":"Being a picky eater, it is quite difficult to find a restaurant that WANTS to make you happy. 
Here, at Tommy V's, they truly want to make you feel at home. Everything I ask for exceeded what I wanted. It was unbelievable delicious. 
I come back whenever I can to the smiling, warm restaurant that is Tommy V's."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the food, based on some of the earlier reviews I have read. I'm in the fishing business and know my fish. So I ordered \"Sea Bass\" expecting a rich moist fish that would almost melt in your mouth. But instead, I got an overcooked white fish that had the texture of an over cooked halibut filet. I wasn't certain, but it could have been halibut, which is not the best fish in the world. Because Sea Bass is a lot like sablefish (blackcod) and has a high oil content, it should have been moist and wonderful. This was a real disappointment.

My friends had the bouillabaisse fish stew and it was OK, but not exceptional tasting. It could have been prepared with a little more garlic, and a ting of saffron to flavor it up a bit.

The service was so, so and we had to keep asking for the water to be refilled. Which was strange, because the restaurant was maybe 60% full for a Friday night.

Nice atmosphere and the music was nice playing in the background."}
{"text":"Definately a great new place

We were in the neighborhood and had just an hour for a quick bite, so I picked this place after looking at the Happy Hour menu online and I am so happy that I did. 

First, it's a great looking place on the inside very open which I always like. Second the $5 wine list for the happy hour wasn't just a few choices of low end suppliers like Gallo, but really good wines and lots of them. Finally, we two of the twenty or so food items on the Happy Hour menu, I had the Eggplant Torte, I judge all italian restaurants by their eggplant, its one of the hardest things to get right. This was some of the best eggplant I ever had. It was fork tender and had an amazing tomato herb sauce on it, delicious. My friend had the Bruschetta Caprese of the Happy Hour menu, which was wonderful and then tried the Goat Cheese & Basil Stuffed Squash Blossom & Heirloom Cherry Tomato Salad. First, you hardly ever see anyone serve squash blossoms which is a real italian treat, but I have never seen it stuffed with goat cheese, mozzarella yes, goat never. It was FANTASTIC. I think it and the eggplant are two of the best things I have tasted in a while. 

To top it all off the service was fantastic, this place is a real gem of a find. We are just sorry we had to leave so soon, we even met two nice people there and exchanged cards, what a great place, can't wait to go back, so probably won't. Can't wait to try the Pork Osso Buco.

Bravo Tommy V's, I'll Be Back"}
{"text":"This is the best pasta I have had in a long time. I highly recommend Tommy's Amazing Pasta Trio it was absolutely fantastic! Our server Mike was also great. Overall we were highly satisfied with our experience and I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place for dinner. I come here quite often and am always impressed. Tonight my boyfriend and I tried the rib eye steak, the eggplant torta and butternut raviolis. Both were fabulous and I finally got a perfectly cooked medium rare steak!! Our experience here tonight was one of the best we've had, our server Jonathan was very friendly and knowledgable."}
{"text":"This is a solid pick if you're looking for a date night out.

If the weather is nice, sit on the patio.  It's very relaxing.

The food is great.  I had the Veal Osso Bucco, which was filling and tasty.

I honestly thought the service was just OK.
It was one of those places where at one point the Manager was helping us, at another point someone else ... then a few people were floating around helping, too.  
It's odd to say, but they were a little too eager.  Stuff was cleared very quickly (in one instance before someone was even done), and it just seemed like they were rushing us unnecessarily, since it wasn't busy, and as I've noticed, it rarely is.  

I still think this is a great date spot.  I just wouldn't say it's perfect just yet.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"You don't want to order the lamb chops it's just not their specialty.    My order was full with fat and little meat.   Their veg was on side was raw.   Sent it back.   And settled for salad.  My wife ribs was excellent."}
{"text":"Had dinner here this past Monday (11/23) with some of my staff members to celebrate my boss's Birthday. I couldn't get the server's name, but she had long dark hair tied in a pony tail and has what most people would consider an unhappy face. Absolutely an unpleasant gal to even talk to. The moment you responded back to an attitude that was given, she tried to pull that reverse psychology role and make it seem like.... \"I'm sorry but I have no idea what you are talking about\" 

At the beginning of service, my boyfriend and I had simply asked and requested for our meal to be on a separate check as we felt it was uncomfortable to have the Birthday man pay for our dinner. Just a simple request... She had said Gary (my boss) had already pre-authorized his card and she cannot do that. What is this.... A club? We had asked and simply requested something as simply as that and she challenged every single bit of it. Finally said she would, and needless to say she came back at the end of dinner and said she couldn't do it because her boss told her she couldn't. What planet do you live on when someone ask you, \"please put my dinner on a separate tab because today is the boss's birthday, and we do not feel completely comfortable with him taking care of our meal.\" 

I totally get that my boss wants to take care of our staff, but when another person or I should say two people show up to surprise and wish him a happy birthday, it is uncomfortable and awkward that he ends up paying for our meal. I'm extremely disappointed that something as simple as that was challenged. She made it so much more difficult than it had to be... Come on girl... This isn't rocket science! 

I think a lot of people lack the understanding of human communication, and maybe I should've signed for her. Worst part is, the manager/owner Zorn never even touched the table. For as dead of a place it was you would've at least thought the owner would come over to greet and check on one of the only tables that gave him business that evening. This is suppose to be a quality restaurant with quality service. I give Monday night's visit an, eh! 

Tommy V's might be a good-looking restaurant but it is slowly declining for sure. Nothing good going on here! Drive a little further up North to Local Bistro and see the difference in Service and food. That place is on point!"}
{"text":"I had the best dinner in years here.  The atmosphere was wonderful.  We were there late evening and sat outside.  I had the scallops.  Best I have ever had.  I had asparagus as a side that was done perfectly.  My daughter had  Zin braised short ribs with spinach gnochi.  We could not stop raving about our meal.  Then dessert was fabulous. We had  a salted caramel cheesecake.  They all sounded great but we shared this one.  You can't go wrong.  We are going back for more.  Service was also very good.  Tell you more later."}
{"text":"Good restaurant! Met some friends for a nice dinner while passing through the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. I would have given this place a higher rating but it is super pricy for what you get. We are not cheap and wanted to have a nice night out but the bill was still quite a surprise when we got it. Could you find something even better for the price? Probably...."}
{"text":"I was at Tommy V's for the first time with our Epicurean Toastmaster meeting this past Friday. Not only was I impressed with the food, but the serve was outstanding as well. The butternut ravioli's were out-of-this-world! We had a 5 course meal that was amazing. You can always tell a five star restaurant when the owner comes in to see how everything is for their clients. I cannot wait until the next time I can dine at Tommy V's so I can get try the short ribs. This is definitely going on my favorite restaurant list!"}
{"text":"I never would have tried this if it hadn't been for my coworkers. We headed here for lunch recently with a large group and while I wasn't sure at first, I was pleasantly surprised.

From the outside it looks like a very expensive restaurant, but surprisingly enough it was very reasonable and the food and service were excellent.

I had the rigatoni with Italian sausage while others had everything from the chicken cobb salad the short rib sandwich to the burger. Everyone was raving about their food, as was I.

The atmosphere was very nice as well and they even have live jazz on Friday and Saturday nights which I would like to return and see.

Despite being located in the center of Old Town, Tommy V's feels like a hidden gem that is just waiting to be discovered. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the lunch prices for a modern, good quality restaurant in Scottsdale. I had the braised short ribs with asiago/spinach gnocchi. There were only 5 or 6 small gnocchi but you could tell it was freshly made and had a pillowy soft texture with not too much starchiness allowing the asiago cheese and spinach flavors to really pop. The short ribs were not as tender as I'd like but it was good for the price ($13). My colleague had the pan seared salmon which looked really good.  Hard to go wrong with pan seared salmon unless you overcook it."}
{"text":"Meh.  The menu and pricing mislead you into thinking the food is high quality but it came out in big, sloppy chain restaurant style portions.  The outdoor seating area is beautiful and the waitstaff is extremely kind.  Not worth the money in my opinion."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our Valentine dinner on the patio with great service along with the Sea Bass and Salmon entrees while listening to Jazz music."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner here and did not need reservations.  The facility is very nice and the staff are super friendly and helpful.  They pour(ed) a strong drink!  We did some splitting and the food was good.  Chicken marsala was tasty and the fried cheese appitizer was really good too.

Overall a great experience and I would go back."}
{"text":"The first time I came, I got the happy hour eggplant torta and hazelnut risotto. This time I wanted to try something a little different and got the pasta trio and New York strip. 

Eggplant torta - if you like eggplant, you should try this! 

Hazelnut risotto - it was alright, the nutty flavor was too strong. It overpowered the rest of the flavors. 

Pasta trio - worth trying once if you're curious but wasn't amazing and wouldn't get again. Gnocchi was stuffed and made it sort of soggy. Ravioli was good but it tasted like frozen food from Costco I could have heated up. 

New York Strip - worth trying! Comes with a big piece of meat over pasta. Pasta was definitely for mushroom lovers, real unique taste. Steak had a consistent texture and melted in your mouth with every bite. 

Service:
Service is always top notch here. You can tell they really focus on making you comfortable and cater to your needs. 

Interior:
Outdoor and indoor seating. The lights around their building and the restaurant next door serve as excellent decorations and give off a very calming ambience."}
{"text":"Caters to a very much older crowd but I can only comment as to I went for happy hour. I stopped by on a whim for happy hour and was 1st there at 5:30!  Soon thereafter the retired crowd showed.  Can't be good sign if that's your only customer base...which is a shame because place has a great layout, location and the happy hour food and drink options were very good.  I'd definitely recommend checking it out but just know what you are getting into."}
{"text":"Great place. Went to celebrate a friend's birthday. Service was fabulous. Food terrific. Yummy eggplant. Everyone loved what they ordered. The veal Milanese outstanding. Lovely setting. Do not miss."}
{"text":"This restaurant was one of the best I had eaten in while visiting Scottsdale. The date was 12/10/15, and our server helped the party of (4) from out of town in the outside seating area (even attempted 10x to get then small heater to work, it did!)

Food presentation was as great as it tasted. The waiter's suggestions for meals didn't seem forced on us, but helpful suggestions about what they do strongly at the facility. The eggplant dish was amazing, balanced w the ravioli flavored in a different colored sauce and tapered in an almost yin-yang patten to blend the two items together. 

The staff was way past accommodating about the separate checks, as we each had to write off for our jobs. 

Owners: if you're reading this you have great staff. Especially ours from the night of 12/10 that helped the Alaska-Baltimore m-NY table! Thanks"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for lunch in Phoenix/Scottsdale so far! Really delicious food, beautiful ambiance, excellent service - and at a very reasonable price.

We came here yesterday and were pleasantly surprised to see that happy hour is from 11-6:30. The weather was incredible so we sat outside in their beautiful courtyard. The decor is modern contemporary, and they play soft pop/R&B from the 90s and 2000s, which is kind of mellow in an unpretentious way. We had a really sweet waitress who made sure that our experience was very smooth.

Onto the best part - the food --- When the bread is incredible, it's just such a good sign! The balsamic vinagrette with the oil is really excellent quality. I almost asked them where they get it, because we've been having trouble finding good balsamic out here. After the bread, we had Mini Ciabatta Sliders, which come with ricotta, basil, asiago, EVOO, and fig jam that is to die for! Then I ordered the Grilled Cheese and Short Rib sandwich, which came pressed with arugula, caramelized onions, manchego & cheddar. Again, AMAZING. My husband ordered the Bistro Tender & Panzanella Salad, which is served with grilled beef tenderloin, organic tomatoes, red onions, olives, romaine, croutons, and drizzled with balsamic reduction. He took a bite and was like \"Wow, this is REALLY good!\"

I cant stress enough how good the food is! The fresh ingredients, delicious flavor profiles, unique combinations... it really feels like the person who is making your food cares deeply for it, and it makes a big difference!

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had yet another great lunch a Tommy V's. Had the chicken panini its a great sandwich & the friez are \"killer\" tossed in parmason cheese and spices , they are so gooooood!  And lunches are very reasonable in prices. You all got to try this place.  YUM......."}
{"text":"From the road and the outside of the building it looked more like an office space. But to my surprise the inside was very clean and sleek. Really authentic and delicious Italian food."}
{"text":"Scottsdale is one of those cities that doesn't immediately come to mind as an innovator of the culinary arts. I will say, however, that I have been impressed by the sheer amount of portions and quality of food at certain restaurants here. Tommy V's Urban Kitchen & Bar would easily get a 3ish star in SF, but in Scottsdale, closer to a 4.

I came with a couple of colleagues on a business trip, and we were almost the only people in the unusually large space. Wait a minute -- there was a group of white collar men sitting at the bar who were conspicuously leering at our table since we were the only 2 groups there. That aside, here's what we ordered:

Baby Beet Avocado Puree, Goat Cheese, Muscato Vinaigrette & Roasted Macadamia
- nice and fresh, but nothing that special 
 
Tommy's Amazing Homemade Pasta Trio, with the following:                                                                                                    
- Tortelli Wild Mushroom, Portobello Mascarpone
- Ravioli Spinach Ricotta Truffle
- Gnocchi, Brie, Asiago Cheese, Brown Butter Sage Sauce
-- this was great as portions were large and perfect for us to share. I liked all 3, but the tortelli wild mushroom was my favorite

Eggplant Torta & Butternut Squash Ravioli Herb Tomato Sauce, Cheese Fondue     
 - can't remember this too well to be honest

Potato-Hazelnut Truffle Soufflé - amazing!

And yes, I did copy those items straight from the menu. Our experience was also paired with an extremely nervous waiter who was constantly coming by to check in on us, tell us incorrect information, then come back to correct himself. I'm sure he was trying his best to deliver great service, but it was a bit overkill. All in all, nice restaurant for an affordable meal in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Accommodating staff, good food, reasonable prices, good location

This is a good, old fashioned Italian restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious!!! I loved the Stetson salad - couscous, roma tomatoes, corn, arugula, smoked salmon, cheese, black currant topped with a basal pesto dressing. Their gnocchi was delicious as well! But what I absolutely enjoyed with their SERVICE!! It was a 10 star service that exceed above and beyond the expectations of even the restaurant each self. Our server even offered to switch out any plates we didn't like since it was our first time there. Their decor was a very warm dining room kind of feeling - dim lights, dark cherrywood tables and chairs. I'ld go back just to be treated like a princess!"}
{"text":"I came here for a dinner with a group of 11 & they were able to accommodate and add 2 more people to our party for Ironman Arizona carbloading.  Because I'm gluten sensitive I chose Tommy V's and enjoyed it!!  Both the food and service were great.  Since the reservation was earlier in the evening, we all got our orders in quickly and didn't have to wait too long to be served.  I would definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Food and service outstanding! Owners were amazingly attentive and couldn't have done more to help make our dining experience any better than it was. So accomodating. The food was all perfectly seasoned; generous portions. Has to be in my top 5!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's been great both times. The happy hour menu is pretty good!  Had my 2 sisters in town and they thoroughly enjoyed their meals too!"}
{"text":"\"Thank you\" for Tommy V's!!!   The venue has a nice wine selection.  The food was good. The staff was friendly.  The location in Old Scottsdale is excellent.  Overall, I'll go back to the restaurant.  

The restaurant was the only nice part of our evening after attending a terrible wine tasting event hosted by winetasting.org and Mark Phillips."}
{"text":"Yummy!  I got the calamari, very tender. I asked for hot sauce and one choice was sriracha. I took a little of that, added it to the accompanying marinara sauce and it was magnificent!   Staff very nice too."}
{"text":"Came here due to the good reviews. The food was expensive which sets expectations high. The mojito drink was good. The calamari was just okay. We did like the warm bread. We observed some items on yelp photos that were not on the menu. When we asked about one item the waitress went to ask and never gave us an answer.

My wife was told the chicken rigatoni white wine dish she got came with a creamy white wine sauce. The dish did not appear to have any sauce especially not any creamy sauce and was very bland. I tried the chicken and agreed that it was just bland meat with no flavor. She was very disappointed. 

I got the chicken parmesan and thought it was pretty good. The cheese was not melted all the way. It only came with one piece of chicken for $21 which was surprising. The tiramisu was good, but not amazing. Overall, we would not go back. Seems like a restaurant being pulled in too many culinary directions from Italian to seafood to steakhouse. This is a restaurant that tries to master all, ends up being a master of none."}
{"text":"My new favorite in Scottsdale. The patio seating runs the entire length of the restaurant, which is a block long. Definitely a plus when the weather is right.
Nice selection of wines and cocktails, moderately priced. My Bellini was a little peach-heavy, but a subsequent glass of prosecco was lovely.
Perusing the appetizer menu, I came upon marinated white anchovies with roasted red peppers that was out of this world. Combined it with the rustic bread served as a pre-appetizer-a match made in heaven.
Salads were quite satisfying. We sampled four different kinds and the romaine wedge emerged as the favorite. One visit, I had the pear salad with shrimp added as an entree.
The eggplant torta was really delicious. The addition of squash ravioli to the plate gave a pleasing contrast to the cheesy eggplant. 
Service was beautifully paced and attentive. The feel of the whole restaurant  is welcoming and comfortable.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had the Amatriciana sauce with bucatini. The sauce was delicious, although I would've paired it with a different noodle. The fetuccini bolognese was delicious as always. Wait staff is very attentive, food was served in no time. Malbec was tasty and paired well. Great live jazz and dim lights to provide a pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Most amazing best salad and Sea Bass!  They also offer a twist on the Moscow Mule (fig mule) that was phenomenal.  I highly recommend this restaurant.  Others at the table had short ribs, salmon, and pasta.  No complaints!"}
{"text":"Went there for 3rd time. Had house salad and Tuscan grill special. House salad was excellent. Good combination of flavors. Bread was excellent as well. Great texture sms crust. Not sure what is with just EVOO for dipping. Sure not my taste. 


Tuscan grill had great spices but sausage and chicken were a little over cooked. Lamb chops were cooked medium rare, and cooked perfect. Waiter noticed the 2 on my plate were small, so brought me a 3rd. Nice touch, and necessary because the 2 on my plate were really small. 

Quite busy, but waiter still was appropriately attentive."}
{"text":"Tommy V's never disappoints. Linguini with clams and red sauce (ask for the red over the white) is a must. Beef carpaccio is amazing!  Great date night."}
{"text":"I stopped by Tommy V's sometime during the week after I heard that it was finally open for business. For starters, the decor was simple, tastefully done, clean and very inviting. The place looks open and one can move easily around the restaurant without bumping into everyone and everything. But, let's talk about what really matters, the food. Since I was very limited on time, I decided to look into their Happy Hour menu; which by the way it starts at 11:00 and ends at 6:00 PM. It is fairly extensive and reasonably priced with items ranging from salads to calamari, Bruschetta and paninis, sliders and burgers. I decided to try one of their burgers and it was great. Meat was cooked to taste and was served on a ciabatta roll with a healthy portion of French Fries. I decided to eat my lunch with a glass of wine from their very ample selection available. Sadly, I didn't get a chance to order dessert, but I will make sure to next time so I can write another review about it. I anticipate nothing but great things for this place. Pretty soon the next time I want to eat there I will require a reservation."}
{"text":"Wow...not sure how this is rated so highly?  The food was average at best, with a sprinkle of mediocre.  The 3 pasta dish was boring, bland, tasteless and just bad.  The lasagna was watered down and way too salty.


Service was oblivious and sparse.  Server spent more time chatting with other servers than bothering about his tables.  

The only redeeming item was the calimari.

Would never go back."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time last week. Tinino and the other staff members could not be more accommodating and fabulous. They were all so helpful in suggestions.  We usually pick what we like and rarely try anything new, but Tinino (not sure I am spelling it correctly) suggested various dishes including the Lemoncello sorbet....YUM!

The atmosphere is light and classically casual with a great vibe. Wonderful wine pricing and meals are substantial to share!  

If you haven't gone here, what are you waiting for?!? I cannot wait to go back when I can sit outside.  Thanks for the great food!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best dinner I've had in a very long time.  Three of us dined this past Monday night and it was a bit slow so we rec'd extra special attention from the waiter.

We had the fried burrata and crisp pancetta wrapped prawns.  So yummy and succulent.  Let me talk about the baby beet salad. OHMYGAWD!  I will dream of this special salad forever.  I've never seen orange beets but simply de-lish.  Also, we had the scallops, salmon, and claim pasta.  Just gorg food and ever so good.

I absolutely love this place.  Go.  There.  Now."}
{"text":"We come here frequently and have never been disappointed.  Our server, T, was attentive, on top of everything, but not in your face.  We to dinner earlier and wish we had known there was a quartet playing in the lounge area.  We would have sat on that side of the restaurant.  The restaurant is attractive and well designed.  The assistant staff were polite, and kept our table very happy with additional bread and wine.  We were a table of 4.  I had the eggplant Torte and can't rave enough about it.  Even if you didn't like eggplant, this would make you a believer with the delicious creamy tomato sauce.  My Husband had a risotto that was cooked perfectly.  The other friends both had pasta with a wonderful pomodora sauce with tomatoes and fresh basil.  Decent portions and we all were impressed.  We are locals but if you are visiting, or local, don't pass this restaurant by.  You'll be pleased!  And another positive thing is that they have their own parking lot!!!  And one other thing I forgot to mention!  When the weather is beautiful, they have a terrific patio for outdoor dining!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal! The pace was excellent. They did not rush you and food was served at the right time and temperature!"}
{"text":"Zoran Klisara is one incredible and gracious host. We were served by an amazing young lady Katie B. who took care of our every dining need. Her recommendation of pancetta wrapped prawns as an appetizer was right on the money. Our entrées of short ribs, halibut and salmon were impeccably prepared. Of course we had to try their desserts which were beyond delicious. Chocolate mouse cake, tiramisu, and caramel cheesecake were amazing. We love Tommy V's Urban Kitchen and highly recommend this location for the very best in a dining experience."}
{"text":"Always a great time at Zoran's restaurant. Great appetizers, the clam chowder was the best I have ever had, with amazing entrees. Plus the wine dinners are so fun with great pairings of food."}
{"text":"I am astounded by the crazy high rating for this restaurant. It is perfectly fine, but the selection is fairly limited, and my trio signature dish was adequate but not special.

Service was a little awkward - friendly enough, but amateur. The waiter brought one diner's salad before her side dish, though she clearly ordered them together. Then it was a lengthy wait before anything else came out. This is but one example of things feeling a little off.

Worst of all, something very bad had happened in the ladies' room that we felt compelled to inform management about. So maybe I just was suffering from a lost appetite.

Fine, but I expected more."}
{"text":"Very exceptional Italian restaurant in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale! We unexpectedly ended up here on the evening before July 4th and had a great meal. Happy hour goes until 6:30 and is very reasonable with $5 glasses of wine, and inexpensive well drinks. The wine menu was expansive, I enjoyed a good merlot and white from Chile.  We started with the mozz bruchetta, and it was served traditionally, with pieces of mozz mixed in. This was on happy hour as well. 

For dinner, we got two plates, the eggplant forte, and also the butternut squash raviolis, which was on the super happy hour portion of the menu. Both dishes were deliciously delicate and you could tell they made the ravioli dough in house. The service was also stand-out and I think the owner is the one who sat us, I respected how he was helping the waiters get tables sat and involved in his restaurant, that's probably one of the reasons why everything about the restaurant was exceptional, with attention-to-detail. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went last night for Restaurant Week. I had the risotto carbonara, Chicken Marsala and Gelato for dessert. All were great. Wife had the Pear salad, Red Snapper and it was great also. Server was helpful and accomadating to special requests. Very attentive, helpful. Took the kids and they fixed them whatever they wanted (buttered noodles, etc). Had a nice Pinot Noir bottle that was reasonably priced. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Sanctuary at Camelback for several days, and after a string of \"meh\" meals at 4.5 starred restaurants, we finally found one worth the rating. We ate dinner at the bar and our bartender, Tim, was amazingly attentive. I had the lasagne and my husband had the lobster and shrimp fettuccine. Neither disappointed. My husband also loved the beet salad. The wine list is solid with several options for a half bottle. Good vibe with yummy Italian American classics. So happy we landed here."}
{"text":"Dinner AND dessert was fantastic!! I had the swordfish special with risotto. It was a giant portion (more like 2.5!) But was cooked perfectly and so flavorful. The amaretto mousse was to die for. And, lastly, the service was impeccible!!"}
{"text":"Tommy V's is a great restaurant right in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. They have a nice sized bar, two dining rooms, private room, and patio seating. They have a good wine list offering plenty of variety and many interesting reds. They have a fancy chocolate liquor and bartender recommended an espresso-chocolate martini that was delicious. Lobster Fra Diavolo Was a killer pasta dish with some heat, plenty of clams, shrimp and scallops, and a lobster tail on top. The Herb Lamb Chops, served with brussel sprouts and fingerling potatoes, were cooked perfectly and very tastey. Service was excellent. Will be back."}
{"text":"I have to admit that based on the Yelp reviews, I was expecting quite a bit more. It's not that our food was bad or anything, but it was just okay. That's it. We had some delicious meals while in Scottsdale, but this one was pretty average. The one standout dish was the Cioppino special which my hubby ordered, which was quite tasty, but skip the short ribs. The portions were generous but the quality, flavor, and tenderness were just not there."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite restaurants!  A friend and I had what equates to a vegetarian lasagna (I forget the name)...YUM!  And the mushroom risotto...YUM!  I had a nearly perfect martini, made just for me, with extra olives on the side just 'cause they love me (or so I would like to think)!  In other words, great service!  And it is a hop, skip, and a jump from home.  How could it be any better?  Seriously, I hardly ever choose Italian when I am eating out, but this place will make me rethink my choices every time!"}
{"text":"Delicious dinner with spinach and garlic, the best ! The environment was excellent , music was fun. I would return for sure!"}
{"text":"A friend came into town so we decided to try something new.  The atmosphere was great.  Not too upscale, just right for a little more formal night out.  Service was excellent and attentive.  Angel was our waiter.  

There were three of us.  We had the fried calamari, baby beet salad, grilled shrimp risotto, orechiette with lobster and shrimp and the short ribs with spinach gnocchi.  All the dishes were excellently prepared and flavorful.

The fried calamari reminded me of the way my mother makes them.  Perfectly cooked and a very light batter.  Salad was delicious with just right amount of dressing.  
Risotto was well prepared with great flavor from the shrimp and hint of lemon.  
The orechiette was prepared al dente with a light red sauce infused with the lobster and shrimp.  Yummy!
The short ribs were melt in your mouth tender with gnocchi that were very light in texture.

Will definitely return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Me and my mom recently visited the dine in restaurant, and its location is great. It was around 330 on a Tuesday, so there was no one in the restaurant. Our waiter was a bit slow, and he was sick. He spilt water on our table with out apologizing and got some on my phone when he was refilling our glasses. He was very nice, so we didn't say anything. He didn't seem to want to ask any questions on how we wanted our meal when we ordered (probably due to not feeling well). My moms burger came out on the burnt side after she said well done. The portion I got was medium sized (vodka penne), and filled me up for the most part. It's obviously not up to par with actual Italy food however, it does taste good enough."}
{"text":"If you want Campbell soup pasta n risotto in 3 min this is ur place. Understand b ball season after local patron for years very embarrassed to take friends   Will never dine again"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great staff and an owner that loves his business. Zoran, thanks for taking care of our group of 36 kids and adults.  Your staff were on point with everything and the food..... That was the icing on the cake!  Next time I'll bring my wife here for date night. Thanks agin Tommy V's!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had an 8:30 dinner reservation and arrived to a packed house with live band playing. The ambience was great and works well for both large parties and romantic dates.  I don't usually eat out at Italian restaurants but was pretty impressed with the food here. Seafood risotto was the winner of the night. Plenty of different seafood pieces in every bite and the risotto was cooked just right.  The pasta trio is also very good, with the mushroom one being my favorite and gnocchi a close second. I also shared a caprese salad that was good but nothing to write home about. I'd probably pass on that and try something else next time.  They have a decent wine list with varying price points that will accommodate your tastes and budget. The entrees, while not inexpensive, were reasonably priced for a nice dinner and atmosphere in Scottsdale.  The only downside was that our pasta plate was brought out cold. They quickly took it back and made a new one without complaints, so that was appreciated. 

The menu is varied but not overwhelmingly extensive. I'll be back to try other items they offer."}
{"text":"It was my husband's birthday and after seeing Karri G review I picked it!  We went early, and had great service and conversation with Nick.  Food was fantastic and they brought free desert with candle...happy hour wine was superb for the price!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Tommy V's saved the night! We made the mistake of going out the weekend of the PHX open without a reservation. Although they were slammed they promised to get us in within 15 mins, & followed through. Our server Adam made wonderful recommendations & the entire staff is wonderful! Adam recommended the muscles & he wasn't wrong- spicy but delicious. I had the lobster shrimp Alfredo, which was delicious (and huge portions), the boyfriend had the three meat lasagna & now I have to find out how to make the damn stuff or we'll be here every week."}
{"text":"I was here last night for a birthday dinner. We had a party of 11 and we had wonderful service. The server was very attentive and accommodating to our large group. Our food was done in a timely manner considering our large group. 
When my food was served it looked amazing and I was excited to dig in but was so disappointed by it. The food was very bland, it was as if they forgot to add seasoning. A few other guest said the same thing about their food. 
Tommy V's would had been my new favorite place if it wasn't for the food."}
{"text":"By far one of the best Italian places I've had!! The lasagna is to die for. The cannoli is amazing too. Found my Italian spot when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"After a year, I continue to frequent this establishment. Food, ambiance and service continue to fuel this trifecta of excellence. Honestly, I travel a lot, and it's wonderful to find a staff and owner that truly cares about our dining experience. We look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"I came here with my husband and parents to celebrate my birthday.  We arrived a little earlier than our reservation time, but the restaurant was not busy at all yet, so they seated us promptly.  We started with the Crostino Di Proscuitto and the Fried Calamari.  The Crostino was just okay - I felt like I could have done a better job making it at home.  The calamari was good - they were not overbreaded and had a nice light fry to make the batter crunchy, but not make the calamari rubbery. My family members then ordered the veal, pasta trio, and eggplant torta with butternut squash ravioli.  Everyone seemed to like their meal.  I had a bite of the butternut squash ravioli and thought it was really tasty.  I had ordered a sea bass, which was unfortunately not a good piece of fish.  After my first bite I knew it was a piece of bad fish, and was not about to eat the rest and be sick on my birthday.  The lentil side that came with the fish was AMAZING, so it was unfortunate to get such a bad piece of fish.  However, as soon as the chef was notified that I had received some bad fish, he came out personally, took it away, apologized and discussed what I would like as a replacement.  I ended up not wanting to chance another piece of fish, so I ordered the hazelnut risotto.  It was really great, and I have no complaints about it and would order it again in a heartbeat!  The chef came out after that and checked on us repeatedly to make sure we were all satisfied with our meals.  He also went above and beyond and served us all with a 4 course sampling of desserts, which was a wonderful birthday treat and his way of apologizing for the fish.  The staff was great and I appreciated the the chef was so dedicated to making it a good birthday for me. I will definitely be back to try out some more of Tommy V's offerings."}
{"text":"What a nice treat to eat here. The food was delicious. THe salad crisp and flavorful and fresh. The pasta bolognese was so rich and delicious. Service was great and the cannoli at the end was the icing on the cake. Great meal."}
{"text":"My friends were kind enough to throw me a surprise bday dinner here.  They definitely chose a great place. The waitress was so sweet and accommodating.  We started with the Crostino Di Prosciutto which I highly recommend and calamari which wasn't a bad choice either. I ordered the lobster risotto containing several large pieces of lobster.  It was very flavorful and filling. 
My friends brought in a cake. The staff not only allowed this, but cut and plated the cake for us adding whipped cream for presentation. Talk about above and beyond!!  Every bit of this place was worth the 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Ate late which was a pleasure to go somewhere in Scottsdale. Nice staff, food great. Shrimp and ravioli was very good and tasty and hot. Cheese board was  good, satisfactory with lots of selection. Quiet but people at the bar. Nice atmosphere. Would go back!"}
{"text":"So happy we found this place! Went because I had heard they have gluten free options and a great selection of wine. We were not disappointed! The food was excellent from the prosciutto of the appetizer down to the last bite of limoncello sorbet. The wine was a perfect pairing as well. Numerous members of the staff checked in with us without seeming to overbearing. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cute little Italian spot in the hustle and bustle of Scottsdale.  We were a group of 10 girls celebrating a bachelorette.  I started with an extra dirty martini, which was unfortunately not dirty enough.  I've definitely had better ones in the Chicagoland area.

We shared a couple appetizers and my favorite was the fried burrata.  We also had the Mozzarella Caprese, but as a hater of tomatoes, I passed on this one.

For my entree, I had the Red Snapper.  In hind sight, I wish I had the Sea Bass instead.  The Red Snapper, although cooked perfectly and accompanied by some yummy veggies, was overloaded with tomato sauce.  I tend to enjoy my fish more simply prepared.

The service was excellent.  The waiter heard us telling a long story about me loving corn, and he brought me out a bowl of corn.  It was actually delicious (no lie).  It was steaming hot, buttery with a nice kick to it.  Very attentive service :-)

We ended the night with chocolate cake to share. Nothing special, but nice for a bite or two to end the night with."}
{"text":"Celebrated my Birthday here with family while in AZ. Great Happy Hour, atmosphere, service and great food too. Also has its own parking lot. I'll definitely be back when I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"Food terrific!  Drinks terrific!  Michael the bartender?  Terrific!"}
{"text":"I ate here about a year ago but just recently started reviewing on yelp so this is a little dated. My husband and I were having a staycation last summer and I carefully looked up restaurants that would be within walking distance. I was really looking forward to coming here to have their happy hour and somehow missed that they did not have happy hour the day we were there (that was my own fault, I'm sure). However, we had already been seated and given water and I felt uncomfortable having us leave.  We ended up ordering pasta (I got the pasta trio) and it was pretty overpriced for what it was. The restaurant was mostly empty (we were there on an early Saturday evening) and our waiter was not the most attentive. That said, I definitely want to come back to try their happy hour menu because I have heard great things about it."}
{"text":"Holy Ravioli! Tommy V's is the new place to be for Happy Hour! Of course only if you're a fan of a huge selection of food (small plates) at HH prices, and excellent wines by the glass for $5! I went with a group of 5 girls, we made reservations for 6PM, and despite the Networking event of about 200 people in the bar, we got right in and had superb service. You could tell the entire staff was working as team, which is impressive for a restaurant that has only been open for a couple weeks.  We split a selection of items to get an idea of their menu:  Butternut squash raviolis with sage butter sauce, fried gnocchi with marinara, fig and goat cheese sliders, risotto carbonara and spinach and cheese raviolis (shaped in little hearts)! Everything that I tried was excellent, and I was very impressed with the homemade ravioli's (At least they fooled me if they weren't!) To top it off their bread was amazing, crispy on the outside and soft in the middle, served with some sort of herb infused olive oil.  They did a great job converting the old Café Carumba into an urban yet sophisticated lounge, the patio is huge ... and has comfortable seating(Well once summer is over)! This is definitely my new \"Go To\" Happy hour spot for a date with my Hottie, or a drink with my girls =)"}
{"text":"Fantastic wine at great prices and the food is even better! Love the gluten free options too."}
{"text":"I was a bit dissapoint about this place considering all the reviews here on yelp.  I found the place pretty mediocre.  The look and feel of the restaurant was fine.  Definitely a great place to meet some friends or bring a date.  The food though was lackluster.  We started out with the calamari, which had good breading, but was overcooked.  Actually, either overcooked, or they weren't using fresh ingredients.  I also had the pasta trio, which was alright, but not the mind blowing experience I was expecting from the reviews.  The wild mushroom ravioli was good, but I didn't care much for the other two types of pasta.  My friend had the Cioppino which was on special, and that looked pretty good.  I'll probably stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Add this one to my AZ Restaurant Week Hall of Fame.  So much great good, so much great service, so much awesome all around.  I need to give a special thank you to the owner Tommy for being so accommodating to our large group during Restaurant Week.  He had his staff reorganize our table at the last minute after some changes in our group size and did so at lightning speed.  He personally worked with me to make sure it was right and I can't thank him enough.

I don't venture into the Scottsdale area to dine out very often (even during Restaurant Week) so a little background on how I picked this place.  I needed a Restaurant Week spot that I could reserve for a large group on OpenTable.  In addition it had to have vegetarian options, was charging the Restaurant Week minimum price of $33/person, and was rated at 4 stars or higher on Yelp.  Tommy V's was the only one that met every criteria and polled at 4.5 stars on Yelp.  So I took a gamble on bringing 12 of us here despite none of us having been here.  Its located just east of Scottsdale Road and Indian School in the Old Town district.

Parking here was surprisingly easy as Tommy V's has its own private lot for their customers only.  From the outside, the restaurant looks pretty unassuming.  When you walk in its a different story.  You're immediately greeted by a glass structure with tons of different wines on display for the whole restaurant to see.  On the west side of the building is the bar area (which is fully stocked), and the sit down dining is on the east side.  The interior is elegant, but cozy at the same time.  As a guy I would be perfectly home here in a collared shirt or a suit.  It can be as casual or fancy as you want it to be.

I had done my Restaurant Week research in advance so I knew what I was getting.  Of the three appetizer options, I chose the Orecchiette Pasta.  Tiny pasta shells mixed with crab, shrimp and really nice thick chunks of lobster.  A fantastically rich (but not overwhelmingly rich) pasta mixing in fresh hearty portions of the seafood that goes great with a wine (I had a Syrah).  For the main course, I went with their Short Ribs with Gnocchi and two types of cheese.  Ridiculously tender meat that cuts easily with a fork and a gnocchi and cheese blend that exudes a creamy savory compliment to meat and soaks up the meat juices perfectly.  For the big finish, I went with the Salted Caramel Gelato.  A nice, cold, dense gelato but admittedly I didn't taste as much of the caramel as I expected.  In fact I picked up the chocolate notes on this one moreso than salted caramel.  It was still great, just a little surprising.

Total price for the three course meal, glass of Syrah, tax, and tip totaled about $55.  Between the outstanding food and very attentive service by our server Tyler, it was worth every penny.  And even with a jazz band playing over at the bar area and a full house of customers, our party of 12 was still able to converse easily without yelling across the table at one another.  Even though Yelp gave it 4.5 stars going in, even I was surprised how great the experience was.  Mad props to Tommy V's entire operation for delivering a Restaurant Week experience to remember.  Come for the food, but come back for the people."}
{"text":"Tommy V's will always have a special place in my heart.  My boyfriend wanted to come here to celebrate some of our recent milestones. This place is the absolute perfect place to wine and dine (and seriously impress your date!).  It's a quiet place with dimmed lights and tea light candles scattered throughout.  Super warm, comfortable and romantic.  And parking is certainly not an issue.

Our waiter was phenomenal.  We were immediately seated and our glasses of water were never empty (we were here for 2-3 hours).  Upon introducing himself (omg I forgot his name), he casually asked us what we were celebrating, went through the dinner menu, and also pointed out some wines he recommended with certain dishes.

We started off with the calamari -- yum! You know how some places fry their calamari for too long or not long enough? That certainly wasn't the case at Tommy V's.  The chefs surely know how to make a bomb calamari.  Crunchy, nicely salted and peppered, and each piece was the perfect size (ladies, you don't need to worry about messing up your lipstick that you spent forever applying!).

My boyfriend got the Osso Buco on Risotta Veal Sugo & Hazelnuts.  Holy cow this dish was HUGE.  My SO really struggled to finish this dish, but he loved every single bite he could take.  I had a bite of it and wow, it was super tender and flavorful! And when I say super tender, I mean melt-in-your-mouth kind of tender.  If you're going for this dish, I recommend skipping appetizers and going straight for the entree.

I had the Pappardelle Funghi Di Bosco & Veal Ragu.  Like my SO's dish, this dish was also gigantic! Their pasta was sooooo incredibly soft (its homemade) and their black truffle sauce was so freaking good.  I always like a restaurant that knows how to make a good truffle! Tommy V has definitely mastered this.

As for the wine, I can't recall the name.  I'm pretty sure it was a Decoy Red. My SO always picks the wine and I always just drink it.  Needless to say, we finished an entire bottle in no time.

And finally, after we asked for the check, our waiter came out with a generous slice of a RICH chocolate cake with a whopping dollop of whip cream.  On the side of the cake was \"congratulations\" written in chocolate syrup.

I highly recommend Tommy V's.  It was the PERFECT date night."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Scottsdale. Had the lobster special, it was amazing. Excellent service. Our server nick  was so accommodating and really cute!! Can't wait to go back and try one of the many amazing choices. Nice wine list, moderately priced as well. Truly a gem and an old town must try!!!"}
{"text":"Sat outside and it was a really nice environment.  I wish I would've dressed a little nicer.  I was too casual in shorts. Great tasting mixed drinks.  We had a charcuterie board and it was really good. Everyone was happy with their meal.  Be prepared for smaller portions. Our server was a little spacey, but nice. What annoys me is they gave me a hard time about making a last minute reservation saying they would be packed, and they were barely full by the time we left even!"}
{"text":"Amazing meal!  The food was delicious and the service exemplary -- even on a very busy Friday night.  The ingredients used are clearly very fresh and the preparation & \"display\" perfect.  This is on our \"must return to\" list!"}
{"text":"Came here on 7/24/12 for dinner because of the great Yelp Reviews and star rating on this place.

I had the Beet Salad and Diver Scallops for dinner and a glass of white wine, unfortunately I just missed the Happy Hour but my food was pretty good as was the service.  I decided to sit at the bar as I was alone and was able to watch some TV and see the crowd in the restaurant as it stayed fairly busy for a week night but this is Scottsdale so it's not surprising.

I'd say it's a pretty decent solid 4 stars, but since I've had better I can't give it a 5 star rating plus they covered my scallops with spinach which I dislike."}
{"text":"A very good restaurant - nice menu; good wine list.  In towns other than center-city Scottsdale where the competition is very steep this would be a five star location.  Inside can be noisy, but the outside seating is large and pleasant. Wait staff is very good.  For Scottsdale it is a good value in above-average dining."}
{"text":"My love for Tommy V's skills to impress customers is balanced out with their over-eagerness to be snobby as shit at all times, thus averaging out to an A-OK review.

The pros about this place include decent food and great management. Since my party of 20 was there for a bday party, we were given a back-room private table with menus specially printed out for the bday girl. Incredibly thoughtful and very surprising. To top it off, the owner/manager came back twice to check on us and thank us for coming which was very very kind of him. 

In terms of food, I thought it was decent (nothing foodgasmic) but it had the potential to be better if the server didn't spend 2 hours of my time hyping the dish to oblivion. The eggplant torte I ordered was basically a 3-layer eggplant Parmesan with a side of 4 small butternut squash stuffed raviolis. Pretty tasty sounding, right? Well, according to our server, it was their most spectacular dish on the menu, big enough to feed a family of 20 and made up for 20 layers of eggplant excreted from Zeus himself accompanied with gold raviolis that could have only come from Jesus himself. Don't get me wrong, my favorite meal (probably on earth) is pumpkin-filled ravioli, but not when it comes barely luke-warm and served with a side of ego and annoyances. 

The prices are steep but pretty well expected for a fancy schmancy place in Old town with low lighting and italian-jersey servers. The cocktails were ok (a little watery in my opinion) and the wine selection was pretty satisfactory. The bday experience was amazing for the bday girl, which at the end of the day, is all that matters. Right? Right."}
{"text":"Decided to try something new tonight and boy were we not disappointed!! 

We started with the pancetta wrapped prawns which were very tasty. My entree was the lobster and shrimp ravioli dish. The lobster ravioli was fine but the citrus shrimp was to die for! It was so delicious! My husband ordered the halibut and was very impressed because we all know how hard it is to cook fish without overdoing it. It was light, flaky, and moist. Very tasty too. Dessert was a canoli. It was what you'd expect with a good cream inside. Just the right size to finish off the meal.

One thing to note is that they have a full espresso bar which is something we don't see everyday! 

The one and only reason for 4 stars was that our waiter seemed a little distracted or maybe he was newer? He was hard to hear and he was a bit slow getting me tea refills whereas the water was refilled before it was even empty  (someone else was doing that for my husband). All in all... definitely would come back!!! 

Honestly it's hard for me to walk away with this great of feeling from a meal and restaurant. Often I feel like I can do a better job myself."}
{"text":"The best bolognese I've ever had. Very authentic, great service and quality menu items. The beet salad was delicious. I will be back when visiting Scottsdale. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurant ratings that makes me question the palate of some yelpers.  I'm quite the food snob, and a bit of an amateur gourmet cook (make my own pastas/sauces/breads/ice creams), so if I eat out, the food should best my abilities in some way.  This place simply did not live up to anything near its 5 star yelp rating in any dimension other than its excellent service.  Let me say that again:  Service was excellent.  Waitstaff was very attentive, and the owner was extremely friendly as well.  5 stars for this part of the experience.

Now the food.  The prices struck me as being too low for the area.  $26 for filet/$17 for homemade pasta seemed cheap to my eyes for dinner.  Turns out I was right.  I'd bet a fair amount of $$ that this place started with the best intentions and good quality ingredients, but the owner has cut prices and ingredient quality because he cannot figure out what's wrong with the restaurant given such high yelp reviews but poor customer turnout (Place was very quiet on a Saturday night at 8pm in spite of a great jazz band.).  

Case in point:  my girlfriend's filet was nowhere near a USDA prime or even a choice cut.  I'd guess it was a select cut or a 'no roll' piece of meat similar to what's used at a chain steakhouse.  On top of that, the steak wasn't seasoned at all--no salt or fresh pepper.  It was dreadful.

I ordered the citrus \"prawns\" and lobster ravioli.  The prawns were clearly shrimp, and not even big shrimp:  I'd guess they were 15/20 shrimp at best; nowhere near 10/15 shrimp, and they were definitely not prawns.  Shrimp were also overcooked and flavorless and were cooked via boiling water rather than seared a la minute.  Ravioli texture was great, but filling was mediocre.  Sauce was OK, but didn't seem to be thickened via a typical method (butter or cream).  My guess is that the sauces are premade in the morning and they found butter-thickened sauces would break on them.

Calamari appetizer was not seasoned, was bland, and overcooked.  Calamari were chewy and the tomato sauce served to accompany it was meh.

All in all, the relatively cheap food prices + poor quality of ingredients + shrimp masquerading as \"prawns\" in my dish convinced me the owner probably started with very high ingredient quality and higher prices, but has lowered his price point and ingredient quality to try to spur demand.  I'm guessing he didn't do well, though, even with the best ingredients because the chef in the kitchen clearly isn't the best and doesn't know how to season food.  Nothing I ate had even a modicum of salt on it.

If the owner fired the chef and brought in someone new, raised the prices and the ingredient quality, he'd have a winning establishment.  I only hope he reads this review because it's clear he's trying his best, is a very affable fellow, and I genuinely want him to succeed."}
{"text":"We decided to come to Tommy V's because of some of the reviews from Yelp friends.  I don't know if I should thank you or curse you,  I am supposed to still be on my Hcg diet, so I was not having anything.  However, my hubby decided he was doing the Restaurant Week dinner.  It looked amazing, so I took a little bite of his beet salad, ohh, perfectly roasted golden and red beets with arugula and goat cheese.  Then he had the Eggplant Torta, OMG, it reminded me of the Melanzana (italian for the Eggplant Torta) my daddy and I used to make on Sundays, I had three bites.  Then it came the Lemon Torte, my willpower caved and I had to have two bites.  I guess I will have to go on the treadmill a little longer this week.  Michael behind the bar was fantastic.  I had a taste of a few wines before settling for the Heavyweight Cabernet.  Zoran, stopped by to say hello, we have something in common, he also has twins.   
I can't wait to come back with friends and have the Eggplant Torta again."}
{"text":"HUGE disappointment! I've dined at Tommaso & Tommy V'a is Phoenix regularly and love it. So, maybe my expectations were too high. The service was awful. It took 15 minuets from first drink order to delivery of the last drink. By the time that was delivered, the waiter told us the fish special was gone, at 7:15. Best part, white anchovies appetizer was great. Worst part, this is a group of 8 that visits a restaurant together once a month. It took more than an hour for the first plate to be served.. We ordered 8 meals. 20 minuets passed between delivery of first plate and the 8th plate!  Most in our group are polite and wait for everyone to be served before eating. So, they ate cold food. The short ribs were fatty and undercooked. By dessert it was a game to clock the time between presentation of the menu and dessert order. 12 minutes. We just wanted out of there by then. I was the only one in the group who actually liked his meal and I will never return."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves some awesome and fresh Italian food. :)

I came for dinner on a weekday. I ordered the prince edward island mussels for appetizer and the shrimp and lobster fettuccini for entree. The mussels were served in a tomatoey sauce with garlic and smoked chilli, and a side of bread. The mussels were pretty fresh, and most importantly was the tomatoey sauce! It was so good for dipping your bread in it! I almost ate the plate because the sauce was so delicious! The smoked chilli was a good complement to the mussels for those of you who enjoy some heat and spiciness to their food.

The shrimp and lobster fettuccini came in a light tomato cream sauce. Both the shrimp and lobster were fresh and not overcooked. It was a pretty delicious pasta dish.

At the end, my bill came to around $48 tip included and without drinks. I had a great experience of enjoying Italian food. My server was very attentive as well. Overall, I would come here again for special occasions knowing that I would splurge and indulge in the food here with a great experience. :)"}
{"text":"Romantic and sophisticated for a night cap after our walk through downtown Scottsdale!
Enjoyed the Berries w Cream, some espresso w Sambuca, and the live jazz!!! 
My man was disappointed that the \"cream\" most likely came from a can but there is no use crying over spilled milk so we ate around it! 
The dinner menu looked delicious and the service was top notch while still remaining relaxed...
If we were locals we would visit again for a date night!"}
{"text":"Had an absolutely spectacular experience from start to finish, what a fabulous score for Old Town dining!

We went for happy hour and it is by far the best happy hour in town! They offer a nice selection of wines by the glass for $5 each. We decided to try an ample selection of appetizers to share to get a good feel for the menu. We had the Kobe sliders, the salmon bruschetta, the pulled pork sliders, the fig jam & ricotta sliders, the Cesar salad, and the artichoke orzo. The portion sizes were perfect and I can't say enough good things about the presentation! And the taste...unbelievably good, like too good to be true good! We finished with a delightfully light tiramisu. Quality all the way around, by far exceeded our expectations, we will definitely be back. The service was on par with our meal and flawless as well. The server was attentive and witty, and the manager (owner?) took time to introduce himself and inquire about our experience. If you haven't been, you MUST try it!"}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food in a modern setting. 
Came here based on the reviews on yelp and totally worth it! 

I came here on a girls trip and everyone enjoyed their meal. I had the braised short ribs with spinach gnocchi and it was amazing! The spinach was in the center of the gnocchi, covered in a great sauce. And the short ribs were super tender and covered in a delicious gravy. My friends also really enjoyed their meals: lobster ravioli and citrus shrimp; lobster & crab ravioli. We also ordered crostini prosciutto mozzarella bread, the prosciutto was thick and it came with lots of cheese, two thumbs up!  

We would have preferred to sit outside, but for some reason that wasn't an option even though half the tables were empty. I'm guessing they were short staffed. Just a small bump we ran into. 

Would absolutely come again."}
{"text":"Some of the best italian I have ever had. Went here late on a saturday night and recieved amazing service. Waiter recommended a couple dishes and i'm glad he did. I got the butternut squash ravioli and my wife got the chicken parm. They were both great but the ravioli was incredible. We also started with the goat cheese squash blossoms, who knew a flower could taste so good. The fresh bread and olive oil was also very good. This was the perfect place to come and relax after a long day."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes after being seated and never saw our waiter today at lunch. Walked across the parking lot to Grapevine and had our food within 15 minutes. Not sure on the quality at Tommy V's, but the service was not worth it to wait."}
{"text":"Wile we were visiting Phoenix, we visited Tommy V's Urban Kitchen and Bar twice because we so enjoyed our first visit. I loved the environment. There was music and energy but we could still engage in conversation. Our meal was prepared with fresh ingredients and served hot. The bread was to die for. Our servers were attentive but not overbearing. We will be back."}
{"text":"Wine list is extensive with decent prices - lots of California wines available. Food is phenomenal and service is attentive. Patio dining is also available. Located in Old Town with adjacent lot parking. The Prince Edward Island Mussels Smoked Chile Butter & Crostin, and Tommy's Amazing Homemade Pasta Trio are wonderful. The Kobe Beef Meatballs Herb Tomato Sauce are amazing! Serving sizes are not large."}
{"text":"Zoran is the greatest, made us feel right at home and introduced us to some amazing \"super secret menu\" items and some wonderful people. Delicious food and drink and great at home atmosphere."}
{"text":"Another great meal at Tommy V's-
My husband ordered his usual, the short ribs which he loves.
I had the fish stew which was delicious!
A great wait person to make it better!"}
{"text":"Soooo impressed.  Yelped this restaurant while visiting. Went for lunch and was a little surprised to see only one other occupied table in the while place. But any question of how good this place was immediately was put to rest as our server came to our table. 

Had the option to order off of regular menu  or special lunch menu. Our party ordered from both, an from what I gather the lunch menu was the same high quality and serving size as the dinner menu but for 2/3 the price. Yay!

I had the braised beef, super ridiculous tender, rich and flavorful. Gnocchi was super fresh. Wife had the handmade linguini and clams.  Fresh and flavorful. How u can taste the difference when it comes to handmade pasta and fresh versus frozen seafood.  They're on point here.  

Would highly recommend this place for both service and food. An if u want a great value, check it out at lunch."}
{"text":"Pleasant patio. Staff well versed and friendly. Liked: the Zinn braised ribs and gnocchi. The beef rib meat was thick tender. It was \"fall apart\" perfectly cooked. It was tasty, but needed more sauce that stuck to meat vs runny sauce given. The gnocchi was a little starchy filled with asiago cheese and spinach. The filling of gnocchi tasty. Not Liked: the risotto with artichoke tasted over cooked, starchy and uneventful. Deserts are made elsewhere and topped with inexpensive whip cream. The fig mule drink was not all that. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"The service was excellent and I love how there's plenty of parking there.

The complimentary bread and oil/vinegar dip was very good, crusty on the outside while warm and soft on the inside. We got the smoked salmon bruschetta and the bacon cheese burger off the happy hour menu.  The salmon tasted like it was food quality and freshly smoked, however it was very salty. The olives were  even saltier. Towards the end of the platter, even sharing between two people, the dish was hard to enjoy. We even started picking off the olives and eating a lot of the garnish greens on the plate to help.

The burger looked great, served on ciabatta bread with the perfect amount and slice thickness of tomato and onion.  The only complaint I had was that my medium burger was a bit extra charred on parts of the outside and the bread was burned in one corner.  So about a quarter of the burger tasted like a brick of coal.

We ordered tiramisu for dessert. It was actually pretty good and well portioned.  Of course it was $7 so it ought to be!

All in all, i'm not sure I'd be too excited about going back. I might go one more time to try a pasta dish, maybe that's their specialty?  I was a little disappointed because the reviews were so great and the food looked delicious upon presentation. The prices don't allow for much room less than perfection."}
{"text":"Boom Susans! Came here for lunch the other day and have to admit I wasn't expecting much but left very impressed with old Tommy V here. The lunch menu is somewhat limited but everything is half price. If you work in the area and you do not come to this place at least once a week for lunch you are crazy. I had the smoked salmon bruschetta and the wife had the kobe beef stacks. Both were on point and the presentation heres is amazing, the food looked elegant and well thought out. It had the look and feel of a 5 star restaurant. The only reason this place did not get 5 stars was due to some minor lacking in the execution area. They give some good bread to start you off, but then they used the same bread for the bruschetta in the salmon dish. I personally feel that starter bread should only be used as a starter and nothing else, However this place was outstanding in every other aspect and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Now I have to apologize in advance for the delay of this review. We dined here on Saturday night, finally getting the opportunity to review now. 

We made reservations thinking it would be crowded on a Saturday night in Scottsdale, nope. The hostess was extremely friendly and seated us right away. Upon walking in you can't help but notice the ambiance. It's decorated very modern and tasteful. Making you want to see what the kitchen will create! 

The waiter, Jonathan came to introduce himself and get our drink order right away! His vast knowledge of the wines and their flavors/ pairings was impressive! It definitely is a huge asset and came in very helpful to us. He guided us through the menu. We appreciated Jonathan's knowledge and recommendations, especially with my being vegetarian. 

Our food came and it was delicious and extremely fresh! We loved the fried burrata!!! I can't recommend it enough!!!  The creaminess of the cheese will the freshness of the tomato or the peppers is heavenly, not to mention the basil!!  My husband loved his salmon too. The portion was large and everything was extremely fresh tasting. 

Now as for my spaghetti and meatballs ( no meatballs because vegetarian), you claim to be a \" urban Italian Kitchen \" the marinara sauce tasted like it was out of a jar and looked like it. The pasta was cooked properly, and the additional fresh basil helped. Yet, I would think the pasta sauce would have had more flavor or be true Italian. ( Yes, I am Greek and Italian... so I know a good traditional sauce). 

And last but, not least my biggest complaint of all the MUSIC!!!!! It was awful.... straight out of prom night from the 80 or 90's. I heard more Elton John ( Disney Songs) then when my kids were small ( they are 23 now). It is a Saturday night in downtown Scottsdale the last thing we want is bedtime music or music to relax you at 9:30 at night. If you claim to be a urban restaurant and considering your location, you can't have this type of music playing. 

Overall we loved our waiter and the rest of the staff! The menu options we tried were good some were fabulous. If the music is different it's a place we would return to, otherwise in a town this competitive we will find one that has it all."}
{"text":"Loved the look but could only give 3 stars. Food was good but nothing that was outstanding."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this place for a while. It was worth the wait!  The service was excellent. We started with the fried calamari and carpaccio. The carpaccio was best we had ever eaten. Just delicious. The calamari was also very good. I had the short ribs for my main dish. It was very tasty but too small. It was accompanied with gnocchis. If they would have added more gnocchi and another piece of short ribs, it would have been a normal portion.y husband had the fettuccine bolognese. It was delicious. My mother had the chicken Milanese which was light and wonderful. I will most definitely go back for dinner next time. I saw they had a linguine with clam sauce. Excellent place!!"}
{"text":"Went there our first night in Scottsdale - early March. We were delighted to find a quiet place with a nice ambiance after passing SO many places filled with drunken spring training baseball fans. Their menu is mainly, but not exclusively, Italian. We had salads, I had spaghetti and meatballs, my wife spaghetti without the carne. The portions were quite large. The service, from our waiter, Tyler, and others, was excellent"}
{"text":"No. Would rather go to Olive Garden. Sad we wasted a dinner here when only in town 2 nights. The pasta sampler had zero appeal in terms of presentation. Just smothered in bad alfredo. Service was fine but the waiter was kind of short with us. Just eh."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Arizona, I come to Tommy V's. The food is delicious. I love the salmon & risotto. The service is great - the staff is very attentive. I highly recommend Tommy V's - it's my favorite restaurant in Arizona"}
{"text":"We've come here a few times and have been struck by how uneven our meals and food have been. 

This is a blended rating of just under three stars. 

Our visit this past Sunday was at best a two, with my other family members arguing for a one star. But our others visits have been closer to a four, so...  they can write their own review. LOL

But seriously, all of us didn't feel so well afterwards and the food was in a word... Bland. Heck, I added salt to both my Carpaccio and Scallops (photos), and I don't salt anything!  

Maybe the Chef had the night off, but this was a disappointment to all of us. So sorry, we'll take a pass for the time being on coming back. Though I really did enjoyed the black Sambuca. Hmmm"}
{"text":"Food was great.  Service was great!  Thanks Drew, you were awesome!  My only negative was that my husband didn't like he artichoke salad that came with his steak.   Otherwise top shelf"}
{"text":"I came here with my sister wow the food was yummy. services was good enough to want to come back again. We had some great ravioli and the risotto was great as well. came her for the menu and was surpsied that they had a happy hour going on. same food for a better price. I will come back again."}
{"text":"Spacious, clean place.  Friendly people.  Delicious warm bread and Beverage glasses kept full.  My companions really liked the red snapper special and spaghetti and meatballs .  Both stated it was very flavorful.  I ordered Manila clams with linguine. The dish had lots of  mussels but was bland.  Linguine was cooked perfectly Al Dente.  I tend to like food spicy so I cannot say the dish was poorly made.  I would come back but this place is not the top of my list."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. We brought our parents here for their anniversary. We were the only ones in at lunch on a Saturday, but it was July and it was hot.

The service was fantastic and they were able to accommodate my toddlers need to move around, though I don't think I would bring them for dinner. The place always looks packed at night.

The food was really really good, though the portions were smaller than I anticipated. Hard to share with kids when there isn't much there."}
{"text":"Probably the best menu I could find for New Years Eve at a decent price.  I mean decent so don't go thinking $45, it was $85/person.  I mean, it was our 2nd Annual Romantic NYE Dinner of sorts, coupled with attending the Phoenix Symphony.  Oh man, where to start, I really wanted a Vesper, but Tommy Vs bar didn't have Lillet Blanc on hand which is saddening.  But my waitress knew about James Bond drinking his martinis with Gin and Vodka together, so that was a plus in her fanhood!.

I ordered the house cabernet and called it good there.  My Four Course choices were:

Caprese Salad, Chicken Pesto Ravioli, Osso Buco, Chocolate Mousse.

The lady chose:

The Pear Salad, Crab Cakes, Lobster Risotto, Caramel Sorbetto.

I cannot even tell you how divine every course was...words do not confer that!  It was delicious!  I do wish the Lobster Risotto was spicy, I know Tommy's is not a Cajun place but it would have just taken that dish over the fence for my palate. And for that price...I should have just taken half of the mains home, but I would not for we chose to travel afoot.  (Our main dishes were giants on a plate, the waitress stated the Osso Buco was huge, but I think by volume the Lobster Risotto won the competition handily.)

Our waitress whose name I did not commit to memory was wonderful, had some humor about the evening and was there at the right time of every course.  The busser cleared plates fast and our waters never ceased to be full."}
{"text":"My Aunt and Uncle were in town and I was tasked by my Mom to find a great place to eat. My Uncle always picks up the check so the price had to be modest but the service and food had to be excellent and at the last minute Mom threw in \"oh, and we want to eat outside.\" I looked for quite a while at reviews of places, I narrowed my search to the $$ places and Tommy V's stood out as one of the top ones in Scottsdale, I searched for outdoor seating and again of that list Tommy V's stood out. I didn't see any pictures of outdoor seating on Yelp (hint hint Mr. cool owner guy who I know is reading this) so I called to make sure they did have the outdoor seating and made a reservations for the 6 of us. 

My first impression was a great one, I would describe the decor as clean and classy. No clutter, just a perfectly lit, perfectly decorated modern spot with the music to go with it. 

I don't remember what everyone got but two of us got that Lobster Bisque which was super fantastic, and two of us got the \"Manila Clams Linguine\" which is by far the best seafood pasta dish that I have ever had, loaded with clams. A few of us got the \"Grilled Shrimp Risotto,\" and they made my mom something that wasn't on the menu at her request

The service was excellent and our server did a great job suggesting the right wine for each person on the group. Well other than me because I am more of whiskey kind of guy. 

We all had a fantastic time, everything we ordered was excellent and the added touch of the owner coming out to see how everything was makes this place an easy 5 stars and a place I would without reservation recommend to anyone. 

Oh,.. the other thing I noticed when I was doing my research was the consistency of positive customer experiences. A lot of top reviewed places in Scottsdale seem to be hot or cold depending on your server or the night you go. Tommy V's seems to have a formula for getting it right all the time."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim on a Wednesday afternoon. We arrived right around happy hour at 5:00, and it was pretty empty. That is to be expected at that time on a weekday, and it filled up pretty quickly. The service was impeccable! Our waiter as attentive without being obtrusive, and actually listened to us. I have a severe gluten allergy, and he seemed to truly understand how to manage that. They do have gluten free pasta - spaghetti or penne. I had the GF pasta substituted in the Spaghetti & Meatballs, which was absolutely fantastic! Hubby had Chicken Piccata, which he said was also good (4/5 he says). The merlot he had was very good as well. The kitchen paid attention to my allergy as well, because I had no contamination symptoms afterward (usually have some issues after eating out - the price I pay for not having to cook for myself). The excellent service was what made it a great experience though! We will be back!"}
{"text":"So very good. I had the Salmon over Risotto and I left the plate clean. While there is no Wifi and the TV's at the bar are lacking, all is good with food. I never do this many stars."}
{"text":"Sooo many restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale and sooooo many with just mediocre food and disinterested service. Put Tommy's in the first category.  Very friendly.  Owned and run by non-Italians. Just putting a few pics of Sophia Loren and old blue eyes doesn't make it  Italian.  And MORE is not necessarily BETTER. The apps were unusual and way too much on the plates. Some just didn't make any sense. The Orrichetti could have been enjoyed but there was way too much served and the  vodka sauce was fairly tasteless. Owner was there and was cordial.  Not like the Tommy V's in Carlsbad CA"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Had drinks & apps at the bar with a friend. A couple great IPA offerings. I am not a big calamari person, but the stewed calamari was outstanding, definitely recommend! Also had a mozzarella caprese which was good. It's a quiet bar, the Sunday night NFL game was playing on the TVs so wouldn't recommend it for game watching, but great place for a date."}
{"text":"The restaurant is cute and the live music was great, but a little loud. My friend and I split the calamari appetizer which was good, but nothing special. I had the pasta trio which was delicious! Each pasta was very different but complimented each other perfectly. My friend had the grilled shrimp risotto. She said it was good, but probably wouldn't order it again. The best part was possibly the chocolate mousse cake. It was amazing! And perfect to share. All in all, Tommy V's is a fun place for dinner, a date, or a special night out."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food! Very clean restaurant. I got the potato leek soup and the ahi tuna salad. Highly recommend for health conscious restaurant goers."}
{"text":"Seriously the best happy hour in the Phoenix area!  11-6:30 with $5 glasses of champagne or wine and ridiculously cheap, delicious food.  Check out the butternut squash ravioli and the risotto - so tasty!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE if you have food allergies. We requested gluten free pasta and we were served with gluten full pasta.  The food and service were otherwise good. The restaurant did not pick up this meal and for that we were very disappointed. Luckily we noticed the pasta was wrong."}
{"text":"Don't understand some of the negative reviews here.  Hubby and I recently visited Scottsdale for a short get away and we were staying very nearby at the lovely Hermosa Inn and didn't want to drive too far for dinner after a long day of traveling.  We were driving by and noticed Tommy V's Pizza and since the hubs loves him some pizza we decided to go in.  

Normally we like to sit at the bar, but it was packed since it was a Friday night and during happy hour so we took a hightop nearby instead.  Service here was excellent.  I believe our server's name was Bob and Bob was excellent.  We received our drinks promptly and some lush bread with some type of pesto butter I believe, whatever it was it was good.

I got the Fettucine Bolognese and hubby settled on a meat pizza of some kind.  Food came out promptly and both meals very good.  The place was packed with people and the vibe was good.  I don't understand some of the negative reviews, food and service when we were here was great."}
{"text":"We are in AZ from Cali, due to family illness. We were tired, hungry, and emotionally beaten. Wifey wanted to eat at the resort, but I coaxed her down the street about 100 yards. Great decision!

We were one of two parties on the patio, which was lovely.  Our server was energetic, attentive, and kind.  I think he kinda read our need for TLC.

We started with the fried burrata, which was served with good olives, prosciutto, and an ok tomato.  We expected the burrata to be hot (it's fried after all) but it was room temp.  I looked it up, and that's how it's done.  I'm apparently a Philistine. For all you other Unhipsters like me, take note: the burrata is NOT hot ;-)

Wifey had a wedge salad, which had great crunch, and what tasted like homemade bleu dressing. Goodgoodgood.

I had the duet of eggplant torta with butternut ravioli. The torta was thinly sliced fried eggplant, stacked,  and sauced. Unctuous! Cinnamon in the ravioli was surprising, and were I Italian, I'd make it at the holidays because it reminded me of pumpkin pie without the sweetness. I totally loved my dinner!

The wine list is very well thought out, with modest to mondo pricing.  Good job, Sommelier!

How much did we like it? Going back again tonight and bringing family."}
{"text":"Great happy hour menu with lots of choices - appetizers, pastas, salads, etc. Risotto & bruschetta were awesome.  Plus reduced prices on drinks. Have an outdoor patio too. Excellent service. Delicious food. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Friendly, attentive service, extensive wine selection, and good food. There's ample seating and a lovely patio. I enjoyed it!!!"}
{"text":"The steak salad and salted caramel cheesecake were to die for. I have a feeling you can't go wrong no matter what you order. A great dining experience with attentive wait wait staff and delicious food."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous happy hour dinner tonight. Started with caprice bruschetta and a prosciutto appetizer I should remember the name of. Both were delicious. Then we tried the short rib stuffed ravioli which were to die for. I had the pasta bolognese, delicious! My Mom had the risotto with artichokes. My Sis had the pasta sampler.  All house made pasta. All thoroughly enjoyed. Service was excellent. Molto bene! Grazie!"}
{"text":"For anyone who hasn't been to Tommy V's in Scottsdale or any of their wine dinners, you are missing out on great food, atmosphere, music and all the buzz that goes with this upscale restaurant, yet you don't overpay.  We had a table of 7 for last night's Silver Oak wine dinner.  The food was outstanding and our group had a wonderful time.  We were never rushed through the dinner, and the rep from Silver Oak gave a detailed background on the winery and how it got started.  We have never had a bad meal otherwise at this restaurant, and Zoran pays attention to detail and wants to make sure each and every customer has an enjoyable experience.  

There are many Italian restaurants in Scottsdale/Phoenix to choose from, but this restaurant stands out from all others.  A couple of our friends who joined us at our table are returning wine dinner diners, and they absolutely love the food (portions are generous), the wine and the experience each time.  

During spring training,  or during the off season, you can catch many big name athletes who are in town and who frequent Tommy V's Urban Kitchen."}
{"text":"went for dinner great happy hour menu had the carpacchio which i always try ...excellent  thin slice but not to thin to where you cant pick it off the plate and the pasta bolognese w veal tasty tasty as well service good atmosphere a bit stuffy but  thats my issue deffinetly worth a try"}
{"text":"Food was great! I got the walnut mushroom risotto and my husband got the pasta trio but we both liked the risotto best. The service was wonderful and I loved the live band. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"My family and I (4 adults 2 kids) were in Scottsdale for the weekend.  We stayed at the W-Scottsdale and was craving Italian.  I did a search on Yelp and Tommy V's was 1/4 mile away from our hotel with great reviews.  We went there around 2:00 so it wasn't crowded and we were seated right away.  The service was good and the food was dynamite.  My husband said it was the best Chicken Piccata he's ever had and my father in law had the Artichoke Hearts Risotto and he said it was excellent.   I had the Spaghetti with Meat Sauce and it was very tasty.  

All in all the place was great and if we're in Scottsdale again, this is a place that we will go again.  

However there was one thing that I wish I said because now I'm kicking myself in the butt.  My mother in law ordered the Chicken Parmesean sandwich with fries on their Happy Hour menu. When the bill came, I was charged for the Chicken Parmesean entree.  The difference between these two plates was $10.00.  For me $10.00 is a lot of money but we were in a  hurry so I didn't want to say anything.  So make sure to check your bill to to confirm that you weren't charged for something else."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times in the past week.  My friend and I met here for a drink mid week and my friend ordered a small side of meatballs and they were delicious!  Made me wish I were more hungry. But more importantly, If you are looking for a good strong drink this is the place. The staff was super helpful, welcoming and friendly, and the bartender even made blue cheese stuffed olives for my friend and I since we love those with our martinis. I will absolutely back for more!

We went back again less than a week later and our waitress was super friendly and personable.  The bartender was creative and yet again made some stellar drinks!  The owner is very involved in speaking with all of the guests, and we spoke to him a couple of times.  It was a fun, laid back atmosphere and is definitely my new favorite place.  I look forward to sampling all of their food items in the near future!"}
{"text":"Well where do I start here, this is in my opinion the BEST restaurant not just in Scottsdale but in the entire Phoenix metroplex area! 
You won't be disappointed, everything from the atmosphere to the service, the cleanliness, and the food is excellent! This is our go to place anytime we want to have a relaxing evening and great good. Everyone there makes an effort to make each visit personal. We have tried several dishes, the lamb chops, the zin ribs, the spaghetti, pork, halibut, most of the desserts, all of the salads, and can recommend all of them! The live music is perfect and really set the entire atmosphere. They have an extensive bar and there is not a drink or spirit you won't find. You might think from this review that we know the owner or staff personally but we don't. Bottom line is if your looking for great food, great portion sizes, awesome service, great atmosphere, and making a memorable evening, try this place, you will go back!"}
{"text":"Great dinner for date night or any other time. The server was very helpful with our dinner selections. I ordered the salmon, while my wife got the sea bass.  Both were as close to perfect as you can get.  I tried this place because of the great reviews and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"This is a really good restaurant! The food was exceptional, the service is knowledgeable and articulate and we got to meet the owner who obviously loves to bring good food to his customers. We went on a Saturday night just recently. The cocktails are refreshing and very creative. We ordered the specials, Lamb. Delicious, cooked perfectly and seasoned with just the right amount of herbs. We had one flaw, the brussel sprouts were undercooked. That's it,,,only one small issue. But, our waiter alerted the owner, a wonderful man, and he came to our table right away to see what he cold do to make it right. We told him that everything (except the sprouts) was perfect. The food, drinks, service ambiance, we can't complain about one small imperfection. He would not let us pay for our dinners! We told him that we eat out and travel often, we have seldom had such a good meal. There was no way that we  want him to comp our meal. There was really no reason for that. He still insisted and said that he wanted to make sure that we would return on our next visit. How could we not? If you want a great meal in a relaxing yet professional restaurant, this is it!"}
{"text":"After coming to Tommy Vs  multiple times and having decent service, today was a disappointment. It all had to do with the waiter.  He was inattentive, got the order wrong, and proceeded to give attitude when we wanted it corrected.  Additionally, I had to ask bus boys on two occasions to get the waiter. Tommy Vs you can do better."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday a while back. They had a back room reserved for us which was nice to talk with friends. Great environment. They even had my name on the menus saying \"happy birthday\". Had the chicken Parmesan. Really tasty red sauce. I'm an Italian food purist and they left me with a great impression on this dish! Thanks Tommy V's!!"}
{"text":"Tommy V's is always great. Every time we're in town it's a place where we always go. Patrick our server is always on point with great service and good conversation. We always enjoy all of their menu items especially the braised short ribs, and the specials are always great. Whenever you are in Old Scottsdale I highly recommend stopping at Tommy V's. Looking forward to seeing you all next time we're in town. Thanks again Joe and Kassie"}
{"text":"The dish I had was overpriced for what was served.  Pasta and langostino(note, langostino second)  Barely could find pieces.  Sauce was good.  Bill came with error on price of special.  They were very nice about admitting the error and the manager came by to apologize."}
{"text":"Delicious food! The Pear Baby Greens Salad may have been the best salad I've ever had! Just remarkably expensive. Nice atmosphere. The decor was pleasingly upscale and the wait staff was in black tie. However, guests simply wear relaxed clothing."}
{"text":"One of the better meals I've had in Scottsdale.  Service was good.  Flavor was there.  Do yourself a favor and split the bacon wrapped prawns with your date and ask for an extra shrimp so you both get 2.  I'd skip the scallop entree although the gnocchi are good.  I'd definitely have the Amatricianna or anything off the pasta menu.  We saw a few of those dishes come out and they all looked delicious.  Dessert was really good.  We had the Limoncello sorbet and the cheesecake.  The double espresso is rocket fuel too, and wakes you up for the ride home.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has gone so down hill.   Sad, it used to be so good.  Walked out a couple of weeks ago BC I couldn't get service at the bar. Bartender was too busy talking to the waitress to care. Last night I took my family. 6 meals and 6 people saying  they didn't like their food.  Everything was WAY over salted including the shrimp. Lobster ravioli was suspiciously fishy.  I had the shrimp and orzo which wasn't as salty, but overall just OK. Our server was good, but that was it.  I should have none when I got a last minute Rez for a big table.  100 better places within a mile.  Don't waste your money!!"}
{"text":"I came to Scottsdale on business & my mom and aunt came to visit. We decided on Tommy V's according to the yelp reviews - and the reviews did not give it justice! We decided to split our meals so we could try a bit of everything. Everything was delicious! Our waitress Elisabethe (from Milan) was wonderful and helped us with our wine selection. We got the Mussels and Caprese salad for appetizers with some Cosmo cocktails. Different pastas, eggplant, and risotto for our entres and a delicious  chianti. Can't wait to come back here - highly recommend! 5+ stars!"}
{"text":"I have really enjoyed Tommy V's the past 3 trips to Scottsdale. They are located a block or two out of the main Old Town area toward 101. 

The pastas and entrees are great as are the salads for lighter fare. I wanted to eat/watch a sports event and Tommy V's bar made for an excellent location as the food quality is better than most spots with televisions in Old Town Scottsdale. 

I like the consistency and quiet ambiance"}
{"text":"We got late (for LA) into Scottsdale.  Here things just started to pick up...
Our waiter was very helpful.  Really tried to male us happy and even said that.. Explained the menu and also told us he can make any thing we want (my wife likes to have her options...).
We ended up with fantastic house bread, very tasty salad, great veil Milanese!, spaghetti meat balls from great Kobe beef.
Dessert was a bit disappointing but is was part of a special week deal. 
The price was also much cheaper that we have paid at home."}
{"text":"I was treated to a birthday lunch on my annual visit to Arizona.  What a lovely place, with a upscale, not stuffy, laid back, west-coast vibe.  The staff was attentive, the atmosphere just great, and the food even better.  I had the house salad, eggplant torte, and wonderful frozen lemon for dessert.  I definately will be returning!"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian tastes in the valley.   Eggplant Torta and Tiramisu are to die for!  Exemplary customer service-I had my doubts about Tommy Vs being a kid friendly restaurant but you surprised me pleasantly with the warmth with which not just us but also the kids were treated, or 'spoiled' I must say.   Thank you.  We'll certainly be back for the next big occasion."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken parmesan very breaded Haven't tried anything else, would give it a second shot because it has Very nice ambiance, live music. Very friendly people who run the place."}
{"text":"Risotto carbonara was excellent! Will definitely come back for more. Great Happy Hour Menu has a perfect selection of wines and flavorful dishes to sample their main courses. We'll be back to enjoy more yummy food to try  with the rest of our family and friends."}
{"text":"Great service great food.  We ate outside and it was a perfect evening. I would return and probably order the seared tuna again.  Yum."}
{"text":"Solid. I'm a bit of a food gypsy wandering during my travels to explore the local haunts. Tommy Vs was a welcome surprise... my shrimp carbonara pasta special was divine! Perfectly butterflied and grilled shrimp sat atop a brilliant tangle of toothy noodles wrapped in an elegant sauce with generous chunks of pancetta. Between this and the beautiful glass of Italian red, I have all but forgotten the worries of my strawberry red sunburn :)"}
{"text":"This place was excellent from the beginning to the end. My fiance order the chicken parm and I got the lobster ravioli and shrimp. And it was delicious and we'll done, portion was just right and the server was very helpful. He actually helped us pick a nice bottle of wine. If you looking for some good food n a nice atmosphere. This is a good spot. FYI it can get a little loud and busy."}
{"text":"Best of the night: mussels, especially the broth. Also great was crispy pancetta wrapped shrimp. Pasta trio was outstanding - all house made.  

The carpaccio was not good. 

Service was good. Atmosphere dead... It's a Monday night, but still we were the only ones there after 9pm."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great service. Came here with 3 other friends and they enjoyed their meals. I would love to rate this higher by my meal was very disappointing. I ordered their special which was the Lobster Risotto and it tasted more Iike undercooked rice than risotto. Had a cannoli for dessert which was a good portion and delicious."}
{"text":"The combination of quantity and festive atmosphere more than offsets the inconsistent food quality, though some of the meats are quite good. When we went with friends the top-round and lamb were very good, the skirt steak and chicken also good. The fish was dreadful, but hey--it's really a meat place! And once you find things you like, you can pile your plate high. They also provide complimentary fried bananas (excellent) and mashed potatoes.

Dessert, in the highly unlikely event you have room, is an extra charge, and the selections look nice. Alternatively, for no extra charge, you can go back to the buffet and have cheeses and bread."}
{"text":"Favorite dishes: Loved the Sea Bass (biggest piece I've ever had out) and was glazed really well.  The side of gnocchi was delicious and great chocolate mousse cake too.  
Overall great service and nice place"}
{"text":"Very Good Food!

Thanks to other Yelpers we took a chance and made a last minute reservation on Open Table for that evening.  

It happened to be Arizona Restaurant Week so we opted for the set menu of $33 which provided several choices of starters.  I had the STRAWBERRY BABY GREENS SALAD - Delish!  My husband had the RISSOTO WITH ARTICHOKES and he loved it.  For our entree's I had the CHICKEN FLORENTINE and my husband had the PORK SCALLOPINI.  For dessert I chose the SALTED CARAMEL GELATO and my husband chose the CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE.  

Wow!  Everything was cooked very well and to our surprise the waiter served a couple of cannoli's with a little candle to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary which I noted in the Open Table reservation.  

It's a white tablecloth restaurant with an excellent wine list.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant as the prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and service was great. Dave C at the bar was very knowledgable about the food and wine. He made good recommendations and I had the Lamb Chops med rare and it was delicious. I would recommend this place for all occasions. I am looking forward to going back next time I am
In Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Five stars: great food, service, prices. Get the grilled prawn risotto and go to heaven!"}
{"text":"The massive outdoor patio is a great place to settle in for a solid italian meal.  The menu is pretty large, and after getting over the initial disappointment that they were out of the item I had picked out, I settled on the shrimp risotto.  It was a really nice dish, although it wasn't quite so much of a risotto as some deliciously seasoned and grilled jumbo shrimp atop a bed of savory herbed rice with lemon (it was long grain, not arborio, and wasn't creamy enough to be risotto).

Also of note here: the wine list!  Extremely impressive selection, and reasonably priced, with a ton of good values.  The calamari is solid as well."}
{"text":"Agree with the previous writers that the service is good and the bread is tasty. However, given the pricing and italian nische the pasta was far from any success italian food is al dente and this pasta was in my mind overcooked hence the rating. Otherwise this place would have gotten a bit higher rating..."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Italian?... I mean really... the food in this culture is fresh, flavorful though it can be unhealthy if all you eat is pasta...

It's refreshing to go into an Italian restaurant that knows how to do it. Everything from the people, the ambiance, the decor, the food, wine selections, etc. The half booth half table seating along the wall was quite comfortable and gave us a great view of the whole place. I also had the pleasure to speak with the owner for a bit and he is a genuine kind-hearted soul who really has passion that is hard to find in people now a days (Zoran Klisara). My baby got beer, I ordered a Sangiovese and my friend a peach cocktail.

We began our culinary journey with the calamari and I enjoyed it because the sauce was fantastic and it was not too greasy or salty like some places choose to fry up their seafood. My friend ordered the bucatini amatriciana, my baby ordered the braised short ribs and I ordered veal marsala. We shared a bit of each others and they were all fantastic dishes especially mine. It is actually quite easy for one to ruin a good veal dish (chewy, rubbery, no flavor, etc). Then when it came time to satisfy our sweet tooth, my friend ordered the highly recommended Amaretto dessert and I shared the sliced chocolate ice cream with nuts and strawberries.

It was simple and flavorful... all of it... not too over the top by trying too hard. Thank you for a great culinary experience!"}
{"text":"I rely on Tommy V's when staying in old town as my \"togo go to\" I always call in and it's always ready within 10-15minutes. Their beet salad is amazing and I have had their risotto as well as a few of their chicken dishes. Would recommend. Great service every time I'm in to! When I go in on the weekends and the they have the band it's a nice atmosphere I just choose to eat in."}
{"text":"Incredible. Great atmosphere and great Italian food. My family came here after a day of sightseeing and were blown away. Zin braised short ribs were perfect. Mussel appetizers spot on. Linguine with clams made my son smile."}
{"text":"Sausages are over cooked, clams are not very fresh
Linguine taste too light
My BF tried spaghetti with meatball he said it is the normal tomato sauce taste"}
{"text":"Right on Indian School Rd. a block east of Scottsdale Rd. in Scottsdale, sits Tommy V's,  an attractive building filled with attentive friendly staff and ownership.  We had reservations for four at 6PM on a Saturday and the place was about half full.  Within an hour it was full!  That's when I noticed the noise level was rather high with laughter and conversations.  This was an attractive and fun environment.  
It was my wife's birthday and several waiters and the owner congratulated her more than several times, a nice touch.  My wife ordered decaf herbal tea and 4 different kinds were brought to the table.  Much has been said about their wine list but none of us ordered any alcoholic drinks.  It was an upscale environment with white linen tablecloths and attractive silverware.  
We started with appetizers, the fried calamari (not the most tender, but flavorful and a good sized portion) and crab cakes (extremely flavorful and attractive to the eye).
We had Shrimp Risotto  (creamy and delicious with lots of shrimp on top),  Manila Clams Linguine Roasted Garlic, White Wine, Fresh Herb Sauce  (a good amount of clams, a few still in the shell, tasty but not wonderful, with well cooked pasta),  Chicken Piccata  (a bit overcooked, lots of capers in a tart sauce, pleasant tasting but not great, small piece of breast cutlet, with a side of penne rigate in a tomato sauce that was a bit dry and didn't have much flavor), and Seared Pacific Red Snapper, Creamy Polenta & Asparagus with Mushrooms, Red Pepper in Tomato Sauce  ( an excellent dish, pretty, tasty, good sized portion of well cooked snapper), one of our better dishes.  Next time I wouldn't order the calamari, chicken piccata, and the clam linguine.  They brought my wife a slice of what looked and tasted like French Silk Pie with a little candle in it (no charge), a nice touch.  It was delicious!
We will give them another try, I would rate them between 3 1/2 and 4 stars."}
{"text":"Perfect restaurant for one of my fave gal's bachelorette party dinner. Five stars across the board for location, ambiance, service, and food

// LOCATION // Downtown Scottsdale

// SERVICE // Top Notch. Hernand was the waiter for our party and seeing +10 hungry patrons did not faze him one bit. He was on point with everything and even had time to crack jokes and be our photographer for the evening. When our friend asked to pack up some of the table bread we had left over, the waiters whisked away the bread baskets and instead wrapped up a fresh loaf and a huge container full of butter for her to take home. Service was perfect perfect perfect.

// FOOD // 
     + Homemade Pasta Trio: One of my fave pasta dishes ever.
         -Mushroom tortelli: I love mushrooms in my pasta and this sauce was in an amazing savory sauce
         -Spinach and ricotta ravioli: Amazing, especially b/c I'm a sucker for veggie ravioli.
         -Gnocchi: Soft, plump, and delish

Amazing dining experience in our intimate private dining room. Can't wait to come back and try some of their other dishes, including one of their many seafood options."}
{"text":"Loved this place!!  Lovely upscale-casual atmosphere, a delicious meal, pleasant service.  After three consistently wonderful visits, I have to say they have earned 5 stars.

The bread is pretty fantastic - it's very soft but substantial (no doughy), with a perfect crust.  

On our first visit, we started with a pear salad, which was nice but fairly average.  The dressing was a light mustard over arugula leaves with blue cheese and pear - very innocuous and delicate. 

For dinner, we had the Eggplant Torta.  The eggplant is firm and lightly breaded.  It's smothered in a light, delectable rose sauce and a small amount of cheese.  The accompanying butternut squash ravioli is served with a touch of cream sauce and has cinnamon mixed inside.  All of the flavors perfectly complement one another.  It's a remarkably smooth, subtle and delicious dish!  

We were trying to decide between two entrees and our server highly recommended the eggplant - he has our gratitude!  He said it's his favorite on the menu, plus it's a generous portion (perfect to split) - great call.  The rest of their service was also really polite and efficient.  The kitchen split both plates for us and the bus boy refilled my water every few minutes (the glasses were small and I drink a lot - huge kudos on this) and brought more bread. 

Since we've been back, I'd highly recommend the shrimp and crab ravioli appetizer and the Pasta Trio - each one sublime!  

The only item I'd warn against is the chocolate mousse cake - it tasted like an escapee from a diner (poor quality and texture meets artificial flavor) and totally didn't belong at such a fine establishment - maybe get the cannoli instead."}
{"text":"This is our second time here and they still have the perfect food and 5 star service. Thanks everybody and special to Kevin for the great service."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best every time we go.  Love  the wine dinners.  Zoran is doing a fabulous job!"}
{"text":"WOW, this place is absolutely lovely.  The food is stupendous!

Pros: 
-Food is absolutely amazing.  
-Service was very professional, friendly and overall excellent.
-Decor is modern and upscale.
-Affordable, fair prices.
-You could feel comfortable in casual or dressy clothes.

Cons:
-It's so far away from my house."}
{"text":"Dining atmosphere was good, it has an urban trendy feel to it.  The food was hit and miss.  I was there with a date and ordered the lobster bisque (decent) and the appetizer pancetta wrapped shrimp.  Apparently from talking to the waiter the shrimp size \"varies\" depending on the day.  My day was small.  Three shrimp the size of a pea pod.  Tasty but not anything to come back for.  My date ordered the Chef's Platter and the pasta trio.  We had looked at past Yelp reviews and everyone said the trio was great.  My date said the platter and trio were both good but he didn't think the Salmonella poisoning he got afterwards was too wonderful.  Hopefully the staff reads this and takes care of the problem ASAP."}
{"text":"Excellent food and wine, atmosphere OK, the downer was that we went on a Saturday night and we were sweating the complete time....I even had to put my hair up in a make shift bun.  Extremely uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I might have jumped the gun with my initial 5-star rating.  While I'm still a big fan, I've had a few disappointments.  Some of the dishes have been excellent, but a few just average.  

The pan seared salmon was really nothing special and the flavors in the accompanying risotto were inconsistent, like one bite was great, the next bland.  My husband ordered the osso bucco, but there was so much sauce the risotto was more like a soup.  I might not have dinged a star if it weren't for a hostess that seats the only four parties in an otherwise empty restaurant right next to each other.  I don't get it.

But I do love their short rib grilled cheese and the risotto carbonara among other things.  Still one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Tommy's.  We went on a Sunday evening so it wasn't very busy.  The service was immediate and attentive throughout dinner.  We thought the food was excellent.  I had the lamb chops which were prepared perfectly with tender asparagus and small potatoes. My wife loves gnocci and Tommy's is made from scratch.  Theirs features a different sauce but my wife wanted a traditional marinara which they pleasantly accommodated. I tasted them and they were very very good.

Their home made bread is excellent dipped in olive oil.  I also enjoyed the Manhattan I ordered.

Despite the mixed reviews we plan to return soon."}
{"text":"What a delight. Great attentive service by our waitress Vee, excellent food and a great atmosphere. Not portentous, just an outstanding dinning establishment, we will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick cheap lunch and had the best spaghetti bolognese of my life. Great service. Great food. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp because I was specifically craving pasta, and I am a picky Italian cook.  My toddler daughter and I met 3 friends there around 6:15pm.  It was not too packed, and they immediately had a high chair waiting for our table.  The 4 of us ordered 4 appetizers (the squash ravioli, the carpacchio, the artichoke heart risotto, and the fried gnocchi), and every single one of them was truly great.  (If I want to get really specific, I will say that the fried gnocchi was a little bland, but gnocchi is bland on its own anyway, so I wasn't expecting otherwise.  Also, I will say that I have had better carpacchio... not in terms of quality, but in terms of presentation and flavor.)  Even my daughter loved all 4 appetizers!

For dinner I couldn't decide between the pasta with clams and the capellini (angel hair with tomato and basil), so Joshua (BEST SERVER!!), suggested he would split the entree in half for me so that I could try both... which was totally awesome.  Both entrees were so good!  I have to mention here that the pasta with clams is the best I have ever had-- it was NOT in a cream sauce or a red sauce.  Instead, it was in a light herb/oil sauce with fresh garlic cloves... perfect!

My friends got the veal and the chicken marsala, which were also truly wonderful.  Total bill for the 4 of us with 4 appetizers, 3 entrees, soft drinks, and 4 alcoholic drinks was $99.  Great!

For service, vibe, and food quality, you really can't go wrong with this place.  I am so excited to finally find a great Italian restaurant-- that doesn't cost a million dollars-- right by Old Town Scottsdale. :)"}
{"text":"I have been in Tommy's several times with my friends for lunch.
The food is delicious and not so expensive at lunch times.
The waiters are really nice. I recommand this place."}
{"text":"This is a nice place.  The service is very good.  it's very attentive and fast.  Food however does take a long time to prepare as it normally does in these kinds of places.  

I had dinner here with a good friend Friday night.  The ribeye steak with steak sauce is good.  The sauce comes on the side and is very light steak sauce true to Italian tradition but it makes all the difference in taste.  The homestyle potato wedges that come with it are awesome!!

The lobster and shrimp fettucini is good as well.  A lot of subtle Italian flavors.  Flavors are not strong and intense like ribeye steak and sauce.  I would suggest eating this mild flavored dish before eating something much more stronger like steak.

The caesar salad was good and fresh.  The croutons taste homemade.

The Coppa Di Amaretto Dessert was fun to eat.   Nothing great but good fun sweet to share after a meal.

Overall we had a good time and will come back."}
{"text":"Way overrated and over priced. Ordered the calamari, which was like chewing on a tire. The pasta trio was so over cooked it was mushy and fell apart in my mouth before I could even chew. The second star is because of the cream of potato soup which was actually amazing but also one of the cheapest things on the menu. 

The gentlemen that took care of us were great. Regardless of the beautiful atmosphere, I'd say this restaurant is mostly show and not much else. The Cheesecake Factory is even better than this."}
{"text":"I am a fan for their happy hour sparkling wine/champagne and the champagne flute they gave me it in. It was absolutely delightful and LARGE!  The prices of the basic  happy hour pasta was a bit steep but the atmosphere overshadowed that. One major issue that knocked this from a 5 star experience to a 3-star is we were treated sub-par. They didn't offer us menus or send anyone over for over 7 mins. A woman in her early 50s was seated near us and wouldn't you know it- was given a menu and server within 1 minute. It was not busy at all, my friend and I were two of the only people in the restaurant at first. I do not particularly like to be ignored and sure as heck do not appreciate it. Becoming successful is what I strive to be at this time in my life and I don't need to be talked down to or treated second rate. I hope if I do return I am treated with a little more respect from the get-go."}
{"text":"It wasn't terrible but definitely not the greatest either...more or less reliable. I will say that the fried burrata was a pleasant surprise and the cannoli was a winner...and I have eaten A LOT of great cannoli in my day.."}
{"text":"Excellent food but pricy."}
{"text":"The best Caesar salad I've had in a long time. The secret must be the dressing. I highly recommend the risotto. Desert... Well it's hard to go wrong."}
{"text":"We decided to go here because the ratings were good and they had jazz.  I'm glad we went.  It wasn't very crowded when we arrived around 8 pm.  There is indoor and outdoor seating.  There was a jazz trio that we really enjoyed.  The food was good as well.  My friend had the lobster bisque and really liked it.  I started with a salad.  I had the halibut in a lemon wine sauce and came with sauteed spinach and fingerling potatoes.  The fish was cooked nicely, that sauce was a nice complement.  The spinach also had a nice taste. The food wasn't fantastic but pretty good.   The service was good throughout the meal."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my birthday. The food was excellent! The sever Tim, was amazing. The host,  Chris, was so enjoyable. Did I say the food was amazing? This place is a treasure. Can't wait to eat here, again, soon!!  Thank you for making my celebration one to remember!"}
{"text":"I recently went here for my friends birthday dinner. The restaurant is cute and cozy and has a nice pleasant vibe. Our server was good but I felt that he kept getting side tracked. It took him awhile to take our dinner orders and it took forever for our friend to get his beer. I ordered a sea food pasta which was one of their special for the night. I was not impressed with the food. My dish barely had an seafood on it and the dish mostly just had pasta with sauce. My favorite part of the meal was the bread they served  when we sat down."}
{"text":"Excellent location and a wonderful menu that provides the freshest food available! Highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Scottsdale on vacation and found this place on Yelp and figured we would try it out. Of some of the casual dining places we went to on our trip, I would say this one was a bit more classy/spendy. Nonetheless, the service was really great and friendly, and they brought more bread when we ran out! The wine was good! I got the Shrimp Risotto which I really enjoyed! It was lighter than a full pasta dinner. My boyfriend got the Red Snapper, which he did not like very much, he felt it didn't have much flavor. We did like the outdoor seating and felt it was an enjoyable and relaxing dinner."}
{"text":"Unfortunately Yelp steered me wrong on this one as our dinner was only ok.

Food: 2.5, Atmosphere: 3.5, Service: 4
Cost to worth it rating: 3 (entrees around $20) 
Return worthiness: maybe for a drink at the bar

Highlights:
- Bread: delicious slices that were crispy on the outside and warm, soft, and a tad bit sweet on the inside. 5 stars
- Raviolis: special app was pretty good with a nice cream sauce to dip the bread in. 4 stars
- Cocktail: fig vodka mule. Interesting twist and a solid mule.
- Late dining: took reservations up until 10pm

Midlights:
- Live string band was cool to have but it got really loud in the dining area
- Bolognese: nice flavor but not a lot of meat. 3 stars 
- Service: girl seemed nice but service was a bit awkward which was unexpected for a nicer place

Lowlights:
- Seabass: way too oily and mooshy texture. Spinach was also overly oily so it was hard to eat. Very disappointing. Assume it had to be sitting too long or something since other reviewers raved about it. 1.5 star

Food was a letdown so wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been to Tommy V's three times, and every experience has decreased since then. 

The Caprese Salad was wonderful the first time I visited. The lobster ravioli was okay, but never again. My boyfriend disagrees, but I'd argue I have a more advanced palate. Finally, tonight I ordered the handmade pasta trio. It's $19 for four raviolis and 7 gnocchi. The ravioli were two spinach and some sort of cheese blend I can't recall off the top of my head. The other two ravioli were wild mushroom. The spinach ravioli were forgettable, and the gnocchi were soggy. The wild mushroom ravioli were really good, but two wild mushroom ravioli are not worth $19. 

So, it looks like we're going to have to break up."}
{"text":"Awesome experience all around, Everything was closed for the Super Bowl, but we had made a reservation and the owner called and said he would stick with it even though it would be a slow night, fantastic dinner and service, thanks"}
{"text":"Just had a lovely double date here & the service was incredible but the food even lovelier! I had the 3 pasta Tommy special and it was delicious! I only wish the serving was bigger for this plate.

No complaints - so delicious"}
{"text":"What happened to Cafe Carumba!?  Oh well didn't attend that place much anyways.  I don't know who Tommy V is but he sure has style.  Modern sleek look with some Rat Pack portraits on the wall - Ain't that a kick in the head!

I ordered the Pasta Trio which was delicious.  The ravioli's were so soft and creamy!  The only problem I see is the portion size.  I guess I can't complain since I rather enjoy quality over quantity.  However, I also thought it a tad bit pricey for the meals.  They do have a huge selection of wine available.  I think if I come back definitely would be during HH.

Service as real good I really enjoying talking to servers who know about the menu but also the wine.  Say Hi to Zorian when you get there he's one of the owners and is a joy to talk to. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Nice service, sat at the bar and had a very delicious smoked salmon bruschetta, it was so good I ate every single morsel on the plate. My husbands pasta dish was delicious (sorry can't remember exactly which he ordered) and he also ate every bite. Like the friendliness of the staff and the vibe of the place. I will be back on my next visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great restaurant:  food was truly fabulous and service was super patient.  I went with my two grown daughters during a ladies vacation at a nearby resort.  The waiter very kindly answered many questions about the specific dishes.  We finally decided on the trio of pastas, the charcuterie platter and the steak salad.  All were beautifully displayed, generously proportioned, and yummy to boot!  We enjoyed lovely glasses of wine and champagne while we sat outside on a beautiful day.  

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The service here is great. Waiting for my entrée and already inhaled 2 pieces of fresh bread,  more on the way"}
{"text":"AMAZING all around!!!!

We came to Tommy V's for my boyfriends birthday, had a large group reservation. When we arrived, the banquet room was set up for our party, with personalized birthday menus all around the table, with my man's name on them!!

The food was top notch. Everyone ordered a different entree and every person was impressed. Service was amazing as well, and when several members of our party didn't show up, they didn't mind one bit! So friendly and accommodating!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine took my to Tommy V's for my dirty thirty birthday. The waitress, upon finding out it was my birthday, gave us a free appetizer, limocello shot, desert and after dinner cappuccino. It was very nice of her to do all that for me, it was way beyond  the standard free desert you get anywhere else. The appetizer she gave us was the Burrata, and it was simply amazing, The mozzarella literally melts in your mouth. We had also ordered the Pancetta Wrapped Prawns and they were delicious as well. For dinner I had the Salmon and it was absolutely perfect. Crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, and full of flavor. It really hit the spot. I had thought about ordering the Sea Bass, but the waitress advised against it letting me know that it isn't one of their best dishes. I always appreciate it when the server will steer you in the right direction so you enjoy your meal. I couldn't have enjoyed the dinner more and will definitely be coming back to Tommy V's. Thank you to my friend and the waitress for a great dinner and dirty thirty."}
{"text":"We went here on Friday based on a craving I had for steak. The host at the front threw me off a bit by just saying, \"hi\", and nothing else after I replied, \"hello\", so after a moment I asked for a table for two outside. He hemmed and hawed as if this were an unusual request, and then went out to look (even though you could see through the floor to ceiling windows that it was practically empty), and then came back and seated us outside. The waiter came and took drink orders. Their Mediterranean fig mule was very good. We ordered a starter salad and carpaccio, which were both tasty and generous helping sizes. I ordered the NY strip steak and my bf ordered the risotto. It took us awhile to finish the first course, so when the waiter brought out the entrees immediately after clearing our salad plates I figured they'd probably been under a heat lamp for a bit. The food was lukewarm, the steak was chewy and overcooked (I'd say medium well when I asked for medium rare) and wayyyy too salty, and I like salty. The potatoes, in contrast, were undercooked and under salted. I didn't try the side salad since I'd just had one as a first course. The risotto was meh. Not great, but not bad. We ordered the chocolate cake with ice cream for dessert. The cake was dry and un-memorable. The real kicker though came the next day when I went to eat the side salad I'd taken home and there was TRASH in it! So disgusting! It looked like the corner piece of a bag precut salad. Don't waste your money at this place unless all you care about is eating at a fancy looking place. The 2 stars are for the good drink and decent started salad and carpaccio. Zero stars for everything else."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for work, and eat at hundreds of restaurants each year, every year and most are forgettable. I don't usually rave about food anywhere so when I say try Tommy V's I don't say it lightly. The food here is simply unbelievable. I had the sautéed scallops which were out of this world. I had dinner with three others in our party who rated our food experience as one of if not the best they've ever had. The Chicken Parmigiana was fantastic as was the home made egg noodles. I can not give Tommy's any higher of a recommendation. Give them a try, I'm certain you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a very nice contemporary Italian restaurant.

We were here last week for dinner and enjoyed the experience.  Our burrata caponata appetizer was very good.  The burrata was nice and creamy and rich and was delicious spread on their bread.

The service was attentive throughout and I appreciated them bringing an ice bucket for our Sonoma Cutrer wine without having to ask.

I had the bucatini amatriciana and my friend had the shrimp risotto.  Both were good but not mind-blowing.

Overall it was a delightful meal and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Dinner and drinks for 4 and one dessert to share was about $100.  The food quality was high, the service was good, staff friendly, and the portions were right sized.  If you are looking for quantity over quality then Buca di Beppo would be more your style. If your want a menu with good variety in a stylish atmosphere then give this place a try."}
{"text":"Excellent service.   Only dined for lunch.   Was a tad disappointed that food did not come out hot, but still delicious.  However, was in a rush to get to a meeting so did not say anything.    The bread is outstanding."}
{"text":"We recently celebrated my friend's 50th birthday at Tommy V's and it was AMAZING! We had a private room with an outside patio. We were able to have appetizers and drinks outside, then made our way inside for our dinner. The staff was so attentive to our needs and went overboard to make sure we were happy and content. We met with the owner in advance and picked our menu with 3 dinner options. I had the salmon and it was delicious.

I would highly recommend Tommy V's for any occasion. The food and the service were both outstanding!!"}
{"text":"The seafood risotto was amazing! Omg! Loved it, highly recommend. The atmosphere was cool too."}
{"text":"We were visiting our daughter and celebrated her birthday with friends while visiting her. We had called ahead and asked if they could provide a birthday cake. We'll it was more than that , with a sampling of different desserts and one had a candle in it. Delicious!  We started out with the mussel appetizer and it was delicious as we're all of our dinners. Service was superb. You also have an option of dining outside. Loved this place and will be back on our next visit."}
{"text":"Food was good but can I tell you that the service was absolutely impeccable. The waiter was attentive to every detail.
We never had to wonder where he was or left wanting. When he served the plates he took caution to notify us of which side he was placing the plates, he explained the specials, he was \"present\". 
Great Job!"}
{"text":"An absolute triumph. I had the unique caprese bruschetta. The bruschetta was interestingly compiled with cubed mozz- a definite twist on the classical slab. For an entree, I had the pasta trio. Normally, gnocchi is dense and heavy, but this particular one in the trio was light and pillowy. The waitress was extremely friendly and accommodating. They even moved us to a table with an outlet!"}
{"text":"I hosted an event last week at Tommy V's.  It exceeded all my expectations.  The owner and staff went above and beyond to accommodate my very large group of guests.  The food was amazing!  It was a perfect night in every way..Tommy V's is officially my favorite Scottsdale restaurant."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and delicious food. The desserts are to kill for!"}
{"text":"If you blindfolded me and put me inside this modern, newly renovated space, I would never guess that it used to be Cafe Carumba or Jacqueline's!  OK - maybe I would, but only because of the layout... they did a great job urbanizing and upgrading this restaurant!

I went in for an early dinner with friends recently and was pleasantly surprised by the new decor, service, and of course, the food.  Being welcomed by Zoran, the Operating Partner of Tommy V's, and former GM of the (now closed) Estate House, was a treat as well.

Service was top notch as our party of five made our way through a variety of menu items family style.  Highlights for me included the following:
-Legume Spinach Soup (lentils, beans, garbanzo, spinach, vegetable stock) - I know it sounds very healthy and boring, but it was delicious!
-Manila Clams Linguine (a tad on the buttery side, but I didn't mind)
-Spinach Ricotta Ravioli
-Veal Parisienne (I'm not usually a veal person, but I enjoyed this breaded preparation)
-Grilled Asparagus (you can never eat enough veggies)
-Potato-Hazelnut Truffle Souffle

And, finally, we shared a dessert plate, but I think I ate the majority of the lemon dessert that was served with fresh strawberries.  I don't know what exactly it was, but Baby M was all about it!

I noticed Tommy V's \"happy hour menu,\" served Monday - Friday from 11am - 6:30pm a little late in the game, (it includes a solid variety of $5 wines and discounted appetizers), but I plan on returning soon to check that out."}
{"text":"How do I begin?

Superior service, superior food, superior ambiance--altogether a gracious dining experience !!!

Have never tasted better linguine with clams and the calimari still resonates as tender, NOT overly breaded which was a relief, served with a magnificent red sauce.   

Hot bread offered with dipping oil was special.  and no one wrinkled their nose when I ordered hot tea instead of wine.

Will be headed there for my birthday to treat a total foodie from the east coast, knowing he will be impressed.

Witnessed a tiramisu dessert that looked spectacular too.

This is what dining out is all about !!!"}
{"text":"Very nice dim-lighted atmosphere and attentive staff.  Excellent food and drinks."}
{"text":"Not being a Fan of either of his two Camelback (and 32nd St) Restaurants it was hard for me to imagine I would like this one any better when a friend suggested it.
First let me say that I am NOT necessarily a \"Bargain Hunter,\"  so the fact that there was a \"Happy Hour Menu\" from 11 AM on wasn't going to sway me. Also to be noted, I have only visited for Lunch. 

There are however incredible bargains on the Happy Hour Menu and between friends and myself we have had almost ALL of the offerings. Several are amazing! Most notably:

           ALL FOUR of the \"Very Happy Hour\" offerings are memorable

           The Bistro Tenderloin & Panzanella Salad is FABULOUS!

           The Risotto Carbonara is AMAZING!

If lunch is an indication, the quality here is absolutely superb and is a NOT TO BE MISSED experience!  The Service on each visit has been impeccable, with the waiter almost unbelieving that we would order so many different offerings.

Plus what is wrong with having delicious bargains for lunch? NOTHING I tell you!"}
{"text":"Looking for dinner on a Saturday night without reservations for a group of 6, luckily this place had plenty of room. Food was good, servings generous, cocktails meh, but a decent list of wines by the glass.

- Enjoyed the white anchovy starter and the roasted beet salad. 
- I had the fish special- large piece of white fish topped with some crab meat. They had run out of escarole, so offered it over sauteed spinach instead. Very good, loaded with buttery garlic sauce. 
- Didn't love the eggplant torta (too much breading on soggy eggplant) and the butternut squash ravioli on the side didn't have much flavor.

Overall, decent food with friendly servers in a pretty dining room."}
{"text":"Any time I see veal on the menu at an Italian restaurant I always seem to order it because it never disappoints me. Once again it didn't fail. The meaty bolognese sauce was very flavorful with generous chunks of veal, beef, and pork. The noodles were perfectly al dente and soaked up the sauce well.

Despite not having family style size dishes, the portions were very generous for the price. I can easily recommend this restaurant for families and foodies alike."}
{"text":"Had my bachelorette party dinner here! 

Must trys: TRIO. Trio was amazing!!! Gnocchi was so soft and pillowy, filled with perfect brie and covered in brown butter sauce. Mushroom ravs were crazy good. 

Service is beyond amazing! I absolutely loved our waiter Hernand. He was funny and entertaining, but had the special skill of knowing when to gracefully bow out and when to return with refills. Upon leaving, one of my girls asked for the bread to go and they packed us a whole new loaf and a full on stick of butter. 

Great place for large parties. We had the back part of the restaurant to ourselves, it closed off with adorable curtains and made us feel like we were in a world of our own- which is great because we are one loud group of beezies. hLove!

Yummilicious Factor = A"}
{"text":"Highly overrated. I ordered the beet salad, which had extremely under-ripe avocado and goat cheese that was so covered in pepper you coughed when you ate it. Next, I had the special. It was a lobster and shrimp fettuccine. It was basic. It was bland. It was the epitome of boring. Overall, the restaurant lacked flavor and imagination."}
{"text":"Short ribs. Don't think I've had them since my mother died in 1975. These were worth waiting for!

This is a pleasant restaurant done in neutral colors with old photos of celebrities on the walls. Good wine list and a full bar plus a fairly short menu with a good variety. 

Since I was eating alone, I started with a decent Malbec ($9). Service was prompt and attentive at the busy bar. I keep a strict paleo diet and that limited my choices, but I was tempted by some of the delicious sounding choices.

I ordered the short ribs. The menu says they come with gnocchi and spinach. I asked to replace the gnocchi with vegetables which was done with no problems. My meal appeared in a reasonable time and was beautifully presented.

There were two good-sized, boneless short ribs with perfectly cooked and presented mixed vegetables. I soul have taken a photo! The meat was fork-tender and absolutely delicious! The mixed broccoli, cauliflower and carrots were a perfect accompaniment. 

With wine and tax the bill was just over $33 and worth every penny.

I would certainly return."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing. It's very classy and the food is prepared exquisitely. Whenever we're looking to have a special occasion meal we know that this place will not disappoint. Excellent food."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, reasonable prices. The eggplant pasta was really good. We also got the pappardelle sausage dish. Overall the ambiance was great and we were really happy. Definitely happy we found this spot in Old Town. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great food good atmosphere nice music.  Great place for a first date or a hundredth.  Tables inside and out. Live jazz bands.  Good drink selection"}
{"text":"Really nice place for date night or to unwind with a bottle of wine. I recommend having the veal it is really good but ask for a side lemon sauce if you prefer it not to be so dry. I also recommend the seafood and of course pastas. I recently had the lobster and shrimp fettucine and it was delicious."}
{"text":"The owner Zoran made a great restaurant feel like a one of a kind restaurant. We will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great dinner here.  I had the pork osso buco and he had the pasta trio.  Both were fabulous!   The quiet atmosphere and attentive service were a nice treat after several meals at other local restaurants that were very noisy and crowded.  The wine list was impressive and the waiter was helpful recommending wine."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat at Tommy V's every week. We have never had a bad meal! The varied menu makes choosing easy since we know we'll be back. The salads are fresh and the hot food is delicious and hot when it arrives at our table. The service is impeccable. We keep going back because it is so reliable."}
{"text":"My wife and I were the only people in the place this Monday night so the service was above and beyond. The Chop Salad was legit, the osso bucco was near perfect. I've paid a lot more for a whole lot less in the past."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, came in with pretty low expectations, but we ordered a few bottles of wine, some apps and entrees and found that the food did not disappoint. don't get me wrong, it wasn't \"5star\" either in quality, service, or experience. But it didn't let me down."}
{"text":"When a skeezy bartender tries to slip Cruzan coconut rum into your drink without telling you they don't serve Malibu, it's a big fail in my book. I saw him do it and he wasn't even going to tell me. WTF, dude?

The big ball of fried, breaded appetizer was something I probably made in home ec 20 years ago, and should have never been let out of the kitchen. But alas, serve it they did. 

I went for a mixer and the service was less than good. I guess when you tell a place you're bringing a buttload of people in, they don't prepare. The A/C was miserable, bartenders were overworked and empty drink glasses just don't cut it in my book. 

Will I return? Doubtful. Too many other places that don't try to slip fake Malibu to a guest."}
{"text":"Enjoyed it! Service (Chad) was outstanding, calamari was delicious, light, and perfectly prepared. Entrees were solid, though not mind-blowing. Well priced."}
{"text":"Outstanding service. The waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu. Suggested several wine options for my dinner companion that would pare with his entree.  Lively music.  Located in the trendy neighborhood of Scottsdale. I selected an entree from the fixed menu which was excellent. I had the Strawberry Field Green Salad with blue cheese, roasted pecans  and balsamic dressing. For my entree I selected the grilled salmon with whipped potatoes and grilled brussel sprouts. (The brussel sprouts were a substitute for the green beans @ my request.) The salmon was cooked perfect and a generous portion. The brussel sprouts were just a little under cooked but still enjoyable. I might suggest that the chef try steaming them prior to the grill. Allowing for them to become a tender. Also try experimenting with maybe a peach, apricot, maple or bacon glaze. Just to give them a little more of a WOW factor. For dessert I selected the salted carmel Gelato which was outstanding. My only suggestion would be for the chef to use a hand whipped cream garnish. A restaurant of this level should never use a whipped cream from the can. Otherwise,  I would definitely recommend the restaurant and would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Tommy V's is a fun, elegant restaurant with seriously good food! I've been here for dinner several times, and each has been excellent. You should definitely prepare to treat yourself to an Italian feast if you're having dinner here! 

The service has been very professional and attentive every time, and has added a lot to the experience. They occasionally have live music on weekends, too! The food is always delicious- my favorite is the shrimp risotto, but there are so many great Italian options to choose from, and the portions are a good size. 

This is definitely one of the best restaurants in Old Town. Do not miss out!"}
{"text":"Good variety on wine list at typical prices.  Decent but not well trained service, especially when it comes to wine service   I ordered anchovies which were wonderful but the veal chop was major disappointment.  Rest of table enjoyed entrees."}
{"text":"GREAT happy hour specials! The bruschetta appetizer was delicious with the fig spread and the butternut squash ravioli was super yummy. Also loved their spaghetti with meat sauce. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had a perfect dinner here! EXCELLENT staff, food, and wine! The waiter and manager were very accommodating to me and helped me make a custom dish. The staff was so friendly, very attentive, and very professional. The vibe is great, cool decor and modern feel."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Beer list was limited but they had Four Peaks. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Bolognese made the chief famous and it is worth a visit. Can't go wrong with the raviolis or the pasta with bolognese. I go there every time when I'm in town.
One of the best in town."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a delicious meal under the stars on the outside patio.  Tim, our server, paced the meal perfectly so that we were not rushed at all but had a steady supply of wonderful food.  This restaurant does not serve drinking straws or drink stirrers - which eliminates this persistent source of pollution and we really appreciate their efforts. We are looking forward to our next visit with great anticipation."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with dinner here for Mother's Day , which was funny since we had just driven by it earlier in the day & I said I had really been wanting to try it, and of course he kept a straight face & didn't say a word to ruin the surprise.  Let me start out with the service...it was impeccable to say the least.  Our server consistently checked on us, answered all of my questions about their gluten free options & was super sweet to our 1 year old, talking directly to him, which he loved & caused him to flirt with her.  The manager (or maybe he was the owner, I'm not sure) also checked on us several times, which I truly appreciate in a restaurant.
Now for the food...it was DELICIOUS!  We started out with the Chef's Plate which had meats, cheeses, olives, peppers & more.  Next up was the main course, we both ended up ordering the same thing (happens more often than not),  we got the filet & it was cooked to perfection, I decided to get the fingerling potatoes & broccoli & my husband went with the gluten free pasta option.  My mother in law ordered the salmon.  Last up was the dessert, my hubby ordered the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake & I got the fresh berries & cream.  Everything was incredibly good & we will definitely be going back & will for sure tell our friends."}
{"text":"Arizona Restaurant Week is something we look forward to twice a year. It gives us a chance to sample the cuisine of places we have not been. This week we tried Tommy V's. We made reservations for 7:30 on a Wednesday night and when we arrived, the place was practically deserted. We were shown to a tiny table for 2 and we asked to be seated at a slightly larger table (my hubby is a big guy!) With only 3 other tables in the entire place full, I didn't think that was too much to ask. We were given the menus and after discussion, decided to chose from the regular menu. Not that the restaurant week menu wasn't fine, we just saw things we wanted on the other menu. However, one of the appetizers (the crab cakes) was not on the regular menu, so I asked if I could have those if I wasn't choosing the special menu. After some brief confusion on the part of the waiter, he said yes. 
The first course arrived and the crab cake (not 'cakes' as written in the menu) was fine. My husband had the lettuce wedge salad which he said was delicious! It looked great too, not a huge slab of iceberg like many. For entrees I had the shrimp risotto, which was really great with huge lovely grilled shrimp and risotto cooked perfectly. Nicely seasoned and a very generous portion. Hubby had the Tommy V's pasta trio which he said was 'amazingly good' and when I took a bite I would agree. He had gin and tonics and I had the Ruffino Chianti (one of my favs with Italian food.) Overall I would give the food an A-. Service was a little slow, but our server was charming and friendly and we weren't in a rush. 
The most interesting thing about the evening was something my H pointed out: he was the ONLY male customer in the place! All the other tables were groups of women! 
We would definitely go back, and I would like to try lunch there...and maybe a happy hour."}
{"text":"The nice thing about Tommy v's is that it is consistently good food and service. They always do their best to accommodate our changing reservation numbers. The service is knowledgeable and friendly and very quick. 

It was restaurant week so I got one of the special three course dinners. Started with the fried gnocchi. It came with a really good tomato sauce. Then had a mixed seafood dish with shrimp, scallops and a small piece of salmon over a bed of braised greens. The greens stole the show for me. Got the Napoleon for dessert. Cream between layers of pastry. It was good but I was so full I could not finish. 

Another great meal."}
{"text":"Great place to meet friends and come with the family.  I love their hapoy hour but it's crowded.  My family loves this place foe breakfast.  It's reasonably priced.  The service is wonderful and great drinks."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh so good!! My boyfriend took me here for a late birthday dinner on Friday night & it met all my expectations & more. We had 730 PM reservations & we were seated right on time. We ordered a bottle of wine & split a Caesar salad, which was very good sized. I got the lamb chops with Brussel sprouts & potatoes & my boyfriend got the Bolognese pasta. It was all sooo good. 

I cant remember our waiters name but he was so nice! I asked him if the anchovies are popular, because I've never had one and it just doesn't sound appetizing to me. And he brought me one to try. So nice. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Very good lasagna special. So big I can't finish. But the flavor was so rich I pressed on!"}
{"text":"I visited on a Sunday night with my 9 year old son. Our waiter, I believe his name was Jonathan, was fantastic. When I tried to find something that my picky son might enjoy, he offered to make a pasta dish that was not on the menu. I asked the waiter for a recommendation on my meal because it all looked delicious and I was having trouble deciding. He suggested the Pappardelle, sausage, broccoli, EVOO, and garlic. This was a dish I hadn't noticed while I was looking over the menu. I trusted his advise and the food did not disappoint, it was absolutely fantastic!  The sausage was firm but not overdone, the broccoli, which I always struggle to get right, was cooked to perfection and all the simple flavors complemented each other seamlessly. We finished off the meal by sharing some chocolate cake. My son stole most of it and he even wore a bit of it on his face for the ride home. 

The food, the atmosphere, and the service were all top notch. I look forward to visiting again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Really great bar.  Welcoming staff. Good selection of wines and cocktails. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food! I won't take away from the fact that it was great food but simply disrespectful service. Came in with 5 of my close guy friends for a nice sit down dinner and we were rushed through every moment of our meal. Our waiter brought the check before we were even done and ALSO collected the tips before we had left. Beyond rude and seemed like we weren't wanted there by anyone. Seemed to fit age range of 45 to 75 and anyone else got dirty looks and rushed service from the staff."}
{"text":"We ate at the bar for Happy Hour and had a great time. The wine selection by the glass was excellent and so was the HH food menu. The sauteed calamari was tender. The wait staff was extremely attentive. I highly recommend Tommy V's."}
{"text":"Michael (bartender) was fantastic; very helpful with food recommendations, very attentive and informative.  The food was delicious.  We had kobe beef sliders, cesar salad, bolognese pasta, and sea bass.  Everything was very good0, although as much as the bolognese was recommended, we might try something else next time.  We had the amaretto mousse for dessert - YUM.  The wine list has great selections, and we had a great time!  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Tommy was revommended to us by the reception of the Hyatt Hotel.
They where right, we where friendly welcomed, food was superior, the fresh baked Italian Bread that they serve as a welcome bite was the best bread we did have so far during our3 weeks trip in the USA.

{"text":"We are visiting from San Diego. This is the second night we've been here in three days. We sat at the bar both times and enjoyed great service and cocktails. 

I have to tell you they prepared the best Carpaccio, wedge salad and bacon wrapped shrimp we've ever had. We didn't order main entrees . If you're up for some supreme appetizers, this is the place. 5 stars."}
{"text":"What an incredible restaurant! My wife organized my 40th birthday party here in the private banquet room in the back. Let's just say it was perfection! They catered to us hand and foot, it was incredible service and culinarily it was impeccable. My wife and I, and most of our 40 guests are foodies, and everyone raved about the service and the quality of the food and its presentation. Every aspect was on point at this restaurant and if you come here for a simple meal or a party like I had you will not be disappointed. Of all of the places and banquet halls in Scottsdale that we have done events in or attended this was by FAR the best. Thank you for making my special day even better. I could not recommend it more!"}
{"text":"I have stopped here many times now when visiting Scottsdale and enjoyed it each time. The dinners have been very good. The service has always been prompt and very friendly."}
{"text":"I first visited this restaurant shortly after it opened.  I have since returned several times and must say that I have consistently received the same service and quality of food - extraordinary!  They seem to always be committed to ensuring not only 100% customer satisfaction, but that every experience is an exceptional one.  I was so impressed that I felt compelled to write my first Yelp review.  

The server was perhaps a little hard to understand (only if you don't speak fluent Italian), but he was extremely friendly and really only added to the culture and atmosphere of the restaurant.

We started with the Fried Burrata.  Delicious!  This is a great starter or even the perfect nosh while you sip their fine selection of wines.

Moving on to dinner...  I am convinced that they have the best Chicken Piccata in town, but they had a Lamb Chop special with Mushroom Risotto on Friday night, so I had both!  The Lamb was done to perfection - very tender.

For dessert they brought me some of the best Tiramisu I've ever had and we finished the night with the traditional Limoncello.

Definitely a must try if you are looking for a quality dining experience in the Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"Yelped this Gem before the Joe Jackson concert Thurs pm. A little leary as it was a Thurs, 5:40pm...uhhh, Happy Hour, and very few patrons. Initially, seated at the bar, but the bartender/server(Angel) was a bit smug, surly, and unfriendly upon our arrival, thus we, politely asked for reseating at a table! Great call as we had a wonderful, personable server, whom made delicious recommendations on the food menu. Ordered delightful cocktails, succulent short rib stacks, ceasar salads...flavorful dressing, tho a bit overdressed, w crunchy croutons, and a smoky risotto carbonera....The Bomb! Had a lovely glass of Carminerre w the risotto to complete our meal! What a wonderful find...cannot wait to return w more of my clan!!"}
{"text":"Tommy v's is my favorite restaurant! I took 13 guests  there last week and everyone raved about the food. service, and atmosphere . The food is amazing ! Everything on the menu is excellent. The short ribs, the pasta, It's Seabass, and I had the shrimp and lobster linguine which was outrageous! PS. The desserts are wonderful as well. M. Hayes"}
{"text":"We decided to come here for lunch based on the Yelp reviews and yes Yelp got it right! Jimmy V's is delicious!!!!! We got fresh bread from right out the oven. I ordered lasagna, my team ordered chicken salad, crab cakes and a shrimp salad. Everyone loved their food!!! The lasagna noodles are fresh and homemade! No one touched the salt and pepper the food was seasoned perfectly!!! Very nice ambiance and delicious food!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Tommy V's a few times, and have alwyays enjoyed it thoroughly. The food has been consistently good, the service is always attentive, and best of all - they have their own, private parking lot right out front. This is a welcomed site on a busy weekend night in Downtown Scottsdale. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Tommy V's was located directly across the street from the hotel my husband and I recently stayed in during our visit to Scottsdale. After walking by the establishment nearly 10 times, we finally stopped to check out the menu on our last day in town. What?! An Italian restaurant just steps away from us the entire trip? We instantly knew what we were having for dinner that night and booked a reservation right then and there. 

The restaurant itself is very pretty. It's sleek and modern with a large outdoor patio and floor-to-ceiling windows to enjoy the view from every seat inside. Tommy V's takes pride in their service, food, and fine wines. 

My husband's favorite Italian dish is chicken parmesan, so it was a no brainer that he wanted it the moment he saw it listed on the menu. His entree came with a side of pasta and a vegetable medley. It was good, but mine was better. ;) Upon recommendation from our server, I went with the chilean sea bass. It was topped with a light lemon wine sauce and served with roasted potatoes and sautéed spinach. I'm so glad I listened to our smart server and got this! Now it's your turn to take MY suggestion and order this dish the next time you visit Tommy V's. You'll thank me later..."}
{"text":"Best meatball anywhere hands down. Worth every dollar and a return trip just to repeat the delect-ableness. But...  Wines are pricey by the glass. Avoid the Pasta Bolognese - bland and chewy and very pricey for pasta with meat sauce. White table cloth atmosphere inside and almost overly attentive staff. Perhaps dining al fresco is a more pleasurable experience."}
{"text":"I can see why they had a 4.5 star rating!  It was horribly hot (115°) so we just had salads for lunch.  Best Cobb salad I have ever had.  My wife raved over her ahi tuna salad.  Our server Patrick made us feel right at home, and was VERY attentive."}
{"text":"Last night I just wanted a quick bite. Being a regular cutomer, I went to Tommy V. To my surprise my bartener, Tabor, recommended a special for the evening. It was called Choppio Frutta di Mare--absolutely delicious--the fish was so fresh. They usually dont have specials, so I was estatic to enjoy something so different and awesome. I hope they continue to have more specials."}
{"text":"So this week we find ourselves at Tommy V's Urban Kitchen for a classy-upscale Happy Hour and just for the occasion we even dressed up! Did I mention we have a great looking crew! Tommy V's took great care of us and started us out right with a few bottles of wine on the table, they know the way to our hearts! But that doesn't mean we are easy, nope!

The Crostino Di Prosciutto, Toasted Bread capped with prosciutto & melted mozzarela sprinkled with fresh sage was simply delish! A big fan of prosciutto, this definitely didn't disappoint and almost resulted in a fork to a hand as the crew fought over the last piece.

Another favorite was the Mozzarella Caprese,  which features Fresh Mozzarella, Vine-Ripened Tomatoes, Basil, and an Extra Virgin Olive Oil Drizzle. It is a perfect compliment to a glass of wine, or two, and is definitely a good choice for the summer! I know it's hard to eat when it's over 100 but not having to give up taste, makes it easier!

{"text":"Great place. Tasty food and a cool atmosphere, and with the weekday happy hour from 11am to 6pm your bill will make you almost as happy as the food. I've tried most of the happy hour appetizers and they're all cooked (or raw) to perfection. Glad to see a quality restaurant in this troubled location. 

I give the place 5 stars despite the service which can be spotty at times, but I understand it's a brand new restaurant so they'll eventually work out the kinks. Still: servers need to be a little less familiar, a little more professional with guests...and even though it's an Italian place and very friendly, the repeated touching of guests' shoulders/backs when talking to them is a little offputting. Other than that minor hiccup, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour which was great for $5 wine glasses and some cheap small plates. The butternut squash ravioli was awesome, the perfect mix of rich and sweet! We got a caprese appetizer and spaghetti plate on the happy hour menu which were both pretty good and not too pricey. The atmosphere was nice, upscale but not pretentious. We liked that there were a ton of options at happy hour pricing so we didn't feel limited in our selection. We will definitely be back to try some other items."}
{"text":"In a word.....Divine!

My colleague and I always choose something a bit more upscale on our last dinner in town on business trips and we were very happy with our choice to dine at Tommy V's. 

The wine selection to start was good and had some \"off-the-beaten-path\" choices. The plates were equally wonderful. 

My colleague is a sucker for pasta and therefore chose the Carbonara. I had a taste and thought it was very nice. Not as creamy as Carbonara is usually served on the East Coast but really nice. Very flavorful and just a tad lighter than normal. I had the Sea bass and it was very tasty with the lentils.

The service was good and the premises very clean and attractive. Looking forward to return trips to the area so I can enjoy this restaurant again.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I went to Tommy V's over a year ago for a late anniversary dinner. Everything from start to finish was so memorable that I've finally gotten around to writing a review after all this time! As soon as we stepped inside we were greeted by various members of the staff. We had a reservation just in case, but upon being seated, our waiter brought out sparking wine and bread. 

We split a Caesar salad for an appetizer and got the clam linguine and fettuccine bolognese for the entrees. All of the food was really, really good! The linguine also came with a lot of clams, so that was a nice change from what you usually get at restaurants. After our meal they brought out a slice of chocolate cake (that had been ordered behind my back) that was also delicious, and it was the perfect way to end the meal. 

We weren't expecting the sparking wine, so that was a really nice surprise. I wish I remember the waiter(s) name(s) because they were fantastic and truly helped make the night memorable. I'd honestly go back just for how professional and attentive the service was."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't try this restaurant until recently. This is definitely a hidden gem that serves fantastic Italian food! 

The decor is not worth mentioning but their food is outstanding. Came with another couple for dinner a few weeks ago. We shared the fried burrata which was delicious. My husband ordered the Chicken Marsala and I ordered the special fettuccine carbonara with shrimp both were fantastic. 

We ordered the cheesecake and tiramisu for dessert but I didn't think they were that great. I would have rated them 5 stars but served was really slow when we were there. Took them 30+ min to get our food out. The great food will make us come back...."}
{"text":"I've yet to come across a truly amazing Italian resturant in the phoenix area. I guess I'm biased moving from NYC. Food was decent, a little overpriced. The bartenders were really great and they had a jazz band playing on a Saturday night. It's a cool place to go with your grandparents I guess... but I wouldn't recommend it if you are under 35 :)"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here to celebrate our new jobs and successful move to Scottsdale. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The food was amazing and the atmosphere was perfect for date night.
It looks like they have a live jazz band that plays a bit later in the evening, but we weren't able to stay this time. We plan on going back soon and staying for the band!"}
{"text":"This is a very good Restraunt but is never more than 1/4 full when we dine there. The service is good, but not great, but the food is very good. We started with a garlic shrimp appetizer and had to dip the bread in the broth just to taste every last bit. The Caesar salad was ok. The Veal Milanese was exception and my wife loves her chicken piccata. More people need to hit this restaurant so they stay strong."}
{"text":"Solid Italian Food Joint!  Bread is great, prices are reasonable and service is top notch.  Had the Pasta Trio, added chicken.  Everything was great, I felt the Gnocchi has a bit of a seafood flavor, but wasn't terrible.  Both ravioli's were outstanding.  Would certainly return!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The service was the best I've had in a long time. The owner came around and personally checked on each table in the restaurant. And was such a warm and welcoming man. I ordered the pasta bolognese and the noodles were so light and fresh and the meat sauce was so flavorful. My husband ordered the pasta trio and all three were equally yummy We had the cannolis for dessert and they were creamy and delicious. Overall such a great experience and well be back the next time we visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My family and I had a wonderful dinner here this evening.  We like to dine early to beat the rush.  We showed up a little after 5.  We also were happy to find out they have a fantastic happy hour.  And I mean fantastic.  Good wines and amazing selections for very reasonable prices.  You can also order off the substantial dinner menu.  We tried the Tenderloin Panzanella Salad, Risotto with Pancetta and Peas and Spaghetti Picchio Pacchio.  All were really good.  Service was TOP NOTCH and I'd also like to add that while I wouldn't say this restaurant caters to children, we had ours in tow (ages 3, 5 and 8) and the staff was AMAZINGLY accommodating to them and so very friendly to us.  I really appreciated this.  We take our children out often as they are well behaved and we enjoy eating out as a family.  A wonderful experience, we can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Tommy V's is a good. Not Great.  Restaurant is large.  It was not crowded but if it were I would imagine it could get very loud.  Started with prawns wrapped in panchetta with a balsamic fig arugula salad.  Very good.  Entrees were the clam linguine and fettucini bolognese.  Bolognese sauce was great but too much sauce on the pasta.  Could  not taste the organic pasta because there was so much sauce.  The sauce should compliment the pasta.  Not overwhelm the pasta.  The clam linguine was oily and did not have a great clam flavor. Service was good but it was not busy.  The prices were not bad.  $80 with tip for two.  Not sure what other options there are for Italian.  The name \"Urban Bar\" I think is more for the style of the decor and not for the food.   Good meal but not great."}
{"text":"We came here the night before our marathon after looking at the reviews and then seeing they made fresh pasta.  We were excited as we walked in. The place has a cool look and our server was nice. 

Negative 1 - there was absolutely no hot tea selection and the server had no idea what tea they had. I usually never get tea but decided to this time. The tea was some cheap brand and was presented completely unorganized.

Negative 2 - the chop salad is not chopped and its more like a side salad on a large plate.
Negative 3 - the beat salad was more of a greens salad with some sorry looking off colored beets on the side. The salad tasted like one big bite.

Negative 4 - the meat and cheese plate that says a selection of such is not so. We received to thin slices of salume and two thin slices of prosciutto. The cheese was cheese sticks and the majority of the plate was veggies. The artichokes were the best on the plate.

Negative 5 - the so called house made pasta is either not house made or the cooks in back do not know how to cook pasta. We got risotto with shrimp and the shrimp was so over cooked that is was inedible.  Then we got the trio of pastas. Tasted like generic microwaved pasta. And was like mush. We didn't finish either plate.

Negative 6 - we didn't want to attempt dessert and i wanted it!!!

This place lacks any food luster. We were so disappointed and bummed. We couldn't figure out how we spent $90. I suggest, if you must go to just go to the bar.

I gave them one star because of the artichokes and our water glasses were never empty. 

In conclusion, this place is just not good."}
{"text":"02/07/12

Met up w/ Violeta for happy hour today, and what a nice change in atmosphere from former Cafe Carumba's!  I really liked the all-glass wine closet display behind the host's desk- what a nice touch!  Cool indoor atmosphere/vibe, as well.  I wouldn't mind spending more happy hours here in the future.

I was hungry and thirsty, so I ordered two apps, the short rib sliders and roasted butternut squash ravioli w/ brown butter sage sauce, and a glass of their white wine blend, which had a bit of moscato in it.  Everything was very good!  I'd order all three again, most definitely.  Especially the ravioli and the glass of white blend.  :D

Hmm... I'm thinking another happy hour here is going on my calendar soon!"}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale for spring training baseball during St. Paddy's Day and this was a great escape from the madness of people celebrating the night away. We called and were able to get a reservation before the main rush of customers (5:30 ish)

The server we had was super nice and attentive. The food was great, we (as a group) had a steak entree, spaghetti, and brown butter ravioli along with appetizers and desserts and everything we had tasted great. The atmosphere was really nice and the old school vintage vibe was refreshing.

Overall we were super happy that we picked this place to eat (and we mainly picked it since it had such good and positive yelp reviews, despite initial confusion over if it was an italian restaurant or an 'urban one' it seemed italian over urban)."}
{"text":"First and foremost, Tommy V's is awesome and could hold it's own against any Italian restaurant in any region in the US.  It wouldn't finish in first place but it definitely wouldn't be last either.  This place has some really good food.

I'm from the northeast and I judge every Italian restaurant for how well it executes linguine with clams (aka vongole or whatever else you may call it). While I must admit that it is my favorite dish, the simplicity of it allows you to truly taste the flavors of the pasta and sauce.  

I really enjoyed the dish at Tommy V's.  Clams were great! The pasta was cooked to slight perfection and the sauce was very tasty (albeit just a tad bitter if I'm being extremely nitpicky).  

Good wine selection and happy hour specials.  They had 10 different wines available for $5 during happy hour.

Service was excellent.  Owner walked around frequently too to ensure we were enjoying the meal.

Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I used my trusty Yelp app to find a restaurant in Scottsdale last night. As I was only in town for one night, and I was tired, I wanted something offering good food near the hotel. Tommy's fit the bill. 

The place is well kept and somewhat trendy, but I didn't feel uncomfortable dining solo. I asked if they minded giving me a booth over in the corner, and the friendly server happily obliged. Water and service came quickly, and staff were eager to know if I had any questions regarding the menu. I didn't really, since I had checked it out ahead of time - I went with the beet salad to start, followed by the spaghetti carbonara. The salad was great - more of a traditional salad with beets on the side, but that was fine for me. The beets (golden) were perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the salad was much larger than I usually expect for a starter. Despite that, I gobbled the whole thing down. 

After (or during?) the salad course, they brought by some warm bread complete with a bowl of EVOO and balsamic - excellent. I limited myself to two small pieces of bread, but could have eaten the whole thing. The blend of oil and vinegar was great. 

Finally, out came the pasta. It was homemade organic pasta, and again, perfectly cooked. Not sure I'm totally sold on putting squash in spaghetti carbonara, but the dish was still excellent. Again, a much larger portion than I expected, but they were happy to pack the leftovers up to go. 

Both staff members who took care of me did a great job - quick, friendly, and efficient. If I lived in Scottsdale, I wouldn't hesitate to go back!"}
{"text":"Soo good! Homemade pasta and the best lobster bisque I've ever had. Shared the pasta trio and if I wasn't still full from lunch I could of easily ate a full portion. I'm pretty picky about my calamari but it was really good!"}
{"text":"What can I say, I wanted to go to a place with style, and this is it. The appetizers (butter squash raviolis) was a suggestion from my server, and the fish was fabulous. Everyone there was top notch, and professional. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Popped in with a friend for dinner one night. This place has always been on my list of places to check out, and I am glad I did, but wish the service would've been better. The food was delicious. I was in the mood for some comfort food, so I ordered the caesar salad and Tommy's Amazing Homemade Pasta Trio. I ate every last bite. The gnocchi melts in your mouth, the ravioli was wonderful and the tortelli was delicious as well (even for somebody that isn't a huge mushroom fan). The server seemed to disappear quite often and hardly came to check on us. At one point, he came over and asked if we were finished. We were clearly not and my wine glass was empty and he hadn't even asked if I wanted another. I would consider giving this place another chance since I had a good experience with my meal."}
{"text":"Innovative cuisine; attentive and professional service by our server Drew surrounded by an attractive outside dinning atmosphere made for a delightful dining experience.  This is a dining must when you visit Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I have been here about 5 times over the last 3 years.  The food is excellent and I'm always excited to go back again.  Zoran is the owner and seems to always be there to greet us.  He is really friendly and knows how to run a great restaurant.  The food is amazing, fresh and authentic! The service is fantastic."}
{"text":"A very tasteful restaurant at an equally fantastic location but the unapologetic service and inconsistent quality of food make this place just about Average.

We were here for a late lunch and the place was not very crowded, we got the table in the corner overlooking the street.The bartender came to get our order for drinks and we asked what premium scotch do they have ? To our horror he pointed his finger in the direction of the bar and asked us to choose.Just to be clear we were not seated at the bar and we had to strain our eyes to read the labels on the bottle.

The server who came to get our lunch order was a grumpy man who was probably having a bad day.
We ordered Hazelnut Risotto (Mushrooms, Shallots, Truffle &Toasted Hazelnuts).
portobello Mushroom sandwich (Roasted Red Peppers, Tomato, Caramelized Onions, Herb Mayo,Basil Pesto and goat Cheese Served with house Salad).

The food was just average nothing exciting also it was quite annoying as the same guy started setting other tables next to ours for dinner service, dropping silverware without any apologies.My Limoncello martini was good which i spilled just before getting the check(that was the only time he did smile).
In totality this was anything but a Pleasant Experience.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"If I could give Tommy V's 10 stars I would. The 1st day in Old Town we ate crapp for lunch and dinner, and paid through the nose. Then we bumped into Tommy's, and have been having lunch and dinner there every day since. The food is perfect, the staff unreasonably attentive, the prices are right (especially all day happy hour).
Peaceful ambience (no loud musak), great patio for lunch, loads of iced water.
Hazelnut and foraged mushroom risotto you couldn't beat in Tuscany at 10x the price
The Ceasar's are better than any in Rome.
The guys who give this negative reviews need their heads and rear ends examined."}
{"text":"Great food! I had the capellini pasta which was great! I also had the house salad which was very good. The lemon martini was yummy as well. Only thing I didn't care for was the bread. It was kind of basic."}
{"text":"Another wonderful night at Tommy V's. Our server Tim delivered from beginning to end as usual. We ordered the three meat lasagna on the specials menu & decided to try the vegetable lasagna on the specials menu as well, they were both fantastic. The bone-in pork chops also on the specials menu were as good as it gets. It was truly a special night."}
{"text":"We were a party of five. The outside patio was delightful. Here during restaurant week. Two of us had the restaurant week special. Enjoyed the risotto, eggplant torta. We also had sea bass, lamb chops and capellini. Everything was delicious. Our waiter was helpful and made good suggestions"}
{"text":"First off, thank you to the staff at Tommy V's for being open on Christmas night! Bless your hearts for feeding us. 

Literally nothing else open in all of Scottsdale, or so it seemed. We called everywhere and drove around for a while. Tommy V's has a pre-fixed menu with plenty of options for a starter, entree and dessert. All of it was delicious! And the staff was beyond nice! 

I'm in a fitness challenge so I had dietary restrictions, to which they were most accommodating. I had the salad with balsamic vinegar, and it was fresh and tasty. The salmon was prepped without oil, as I requested. The server even kept the potatoes off, because they were drenched in sauce and not clean, how considerate! They were extra steamed veggies, instead. My dessert was berries, no cream. The fruit was fresh and perfect. 

I was really bummed I couldn't enjoy the bottle of Jordan Cab with my family, but they swore up and down that it was delicious. 

Overall, this place was awesome and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Came here for a team lunch a month of so ago.  About 20 of us.  We arrive and are promptly asked for drink orders and if we'd be interested in appys.  We ordered 3 chefs boards and 2 orders of calamari for the table to nosh on while we waited for our lunches.  The appetizers were very good. 

Now I can only attest to what I had for lunch. My one coworker and I couldn't decide on what we wanted.  We both wanted risotto and to try a sandwich, so we split the Short Rib sandwich and risotto carbonara.  The sandwich was amazing!!  Tender meat and nicely crisp fries.  The risotto fell a little short. I've had risotto at restaurants and have made risotto at home.  It is a long painstaking process.  But well worth the attention to detail and time it takes. Creamy, kinda.  Flavorful, no. Which was surprising. I had to add both salt (again surprising cause it had pancetta and parm) and pepper to it.  We both agreed that the sandwich was the better of the two we split.  

Service however was outstanding. If I could give partial stars, I'd rate 3.50-3.75"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale prior to moving, looking for a place to live. Found Tommy V's through Yelp and couldn't have been more pleased. Old school Italian, fresh house-made pasta, fantastic seafood, and sauces to die for. The bread alone is worth the trip...not to mention the extensive, impressive wine list. Reservations are highly recommended for dinner: we went on a week night and the place was busy. It was a beautiful evening, so we sat outside on the lovely patio. Looking forward to visiting again once we're settled in town!"}
{"text":"The good part was the bread with oil and parmesan cheese.. lol. I got the chicken parmigiana and the chicken tasted like rubber... my sisters got fettuccine with lobster and shrimp and they said it was tasteless. The sauce was too watery and had a dull taste. They are kind and have good customer service, I just wish their food was better tasting."}
{"text":"This restaurant is on my short list of \"must eat\" places. The service staff was very welcoming, inviting and appeared to enjoy each other's company, as well as be very attentive and extremely friendly and inviting to the patrons. 

Food was excellent! Proportioned well and an abundance of flavor! Being natives to AZ, we were surprised to stumble upon Tommy V's. Now, we can't wait to come back and bring friends with us!"}
{"text":"Really, really great service at this place.   We're vegetarian and often times when we go to Italian restaurants the only options presented to us are really starchy pastas.    Our waiter was really innovative and came back with lots of great options, and allowed us to split the portions so that we got to sample more things.  

I'd suggest this restaurant to anyone roaming around Old Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Linguine with clams-- amazing!  I was pleasantly surprised at the large number of clams that were included in the dish.  My mom got the pasta trio and it was surprisingly tiny.  My dish was cheaper and much larger.  Tiramisu was delicious."}
{"text":"After spending eleven hours in the car driving the last thing I wanted to do is go out for dinner. Tommy V's was directly across the street from our hotel and was convenient to our needs so that's how we choose Tommy V's. I got to tell you this place has got some of the best service I have ever had, and that is a hard rating to get from me considering how I was feeling that night. Everything was cooked to perfection, had wonderful flavor. I can tell you that we did not make it easy on them either, my wife and I split everything during this meal and they split everything to perfection and without complaint. This place went above and beyond to accommodate us, I went from beyond grumpy to relaxed and pleased when we left. My wife and I split the the Pasta Trio and a Romaine Wedge salad, everything came on two separate plates and and I am sure they bumped up the portions sizes to accommodate us splitting the plates. The Pasta Trio had wonderful flavor and texture, the wild mushroom ravioli was my favorite. They had a fantastic little jazz band trio playing, I just fell in love with this place, lots of room, not too load, great ambiance, and fantastic service."}
{"text":"WOW - 18 months later Artie Bucco Jr sent me a Yelp message! 

\"David S.
12 hours ago

Hi Sam,
This is David, your waiter who you skewered last year at Tommy V's.I have deliberated for some time about reaching out to you. I thought your yelp was pretty unfair to me and very unfair to the restaurant. You say in your profile that you don't waste a place for 1 bad meal or \"crappy \" waiter. Well, you did! I want to remind you that I asked if you and your dad were here with The Giants, I did not look at you as \"Country Bumpkins\". You kinda made that up to villainize me.At first I was upset over the calamari and your dad was nice about it. It was your choice to be upset. I tried to lighten up the mood with some levity and you chose to be offended. It is probably good that Yelping back at yelpers is not permitted. I have been serving over 40 years and your review was the nastiest I ever received\"

I guess this place is cool with having their servers contact Yelpers regarding reviews! 

Original Review: 

Wow - what is it with all the love for this place? Have None of you been tot he Italian Grotto?

Maybe this is for the snooty eaters out there - because this place was awful to us. It was 2/3 empty and we get asked if we have a reservation - No, just walk ins... so they sit us right next tot he kitchen by where the waiters come in and out - easily the worst table in the restaurant, and they weren't even busy.

So, I haven't even noticed this when we order a calamari appetizer, which was recommended by apparent not very familiar with good food blogger Jaymee Sire (eisforeat.blogspot.com/2...)  I went with 2/4 of what she said to have - the chicken parm and the calamari. The calamari were terrible - I mean, what do we expect, fresh fish in Arizona must be something of an oxymoron...

So this is where things get interesting - the waiter asks us how our rubbery, tasteless calamari is - I being one who doesn't like to send food back tried to hide the truth, but the look on my dad's face was as if his only son came home to say he got an Al Qaeda male general pregnant and they weren't getting married... So the waiter grabs the plate before we can say anything to have them make another batch.. which we didn't want, and shocker, the second batch was even worse...

So at this point dad is furious, and yells at me for eating enough of the bad calamari creepy crawlers (the ones with tentacles are my favorite) so that he can't bitch at the waiter about how bad it was when he comes back.

The waiter takes away the app and comes back with the entrees - now we had ordered a pasta to share and two entrees, thinking he would brought them out for a pasta course then the main dishes - but it all came out at once. As he places the food down, Dad tells the waiter \"I've been punished before, it's OK, I get it,\" and I am part rolling my eyes part trying not to laugh.

That this waiter has looked us up and down as a couple of country bumpkins not realizing my dad is normally a 20-30% tipper, especially when on vacation with a roll of dough in his pocket. So then, to add insult to injury, this Artie Bucco wannabe comes back to check on how the entrees are then quips \"So I don't have to take these back? Enjoy!\"

Well - Self Fulfilling prophecy jerk-wad - I would be nicer to customers based on how mediocre your food was - I am a Chicken Parmesan SLUT - I ate maybe 2/3 of it. The pasta bolognese? MEH... Dad unfortunately ordered fish for his main dish, which was again NOT fresh, so he pretty much at all the rest of the pasta t the table.

I will never go back here - give me the Italian Grotto every day, where the food is better, the servers have personality, and the food is amazing - strange how THEIR calamari tastes fresh..."}
{"text":"If you look up the word Upscale in Tommy Vs dictionary it lists  arrogant, pompous and snooty. The food may be good but the vibe  and experience were wholly unenjoyable. There are better options in Old Town"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Tommy V's last night and had a great meal. I started with lobster bisque, which was a bit pricey at $11 for a half bowl, but the flavor was good and the consistency was smooth. The bread comes out warm and is very good. I had the short ribs, which were outstanding. Served with a pillowy gnocchi, it was a perfect match. My wife had the chicken cacciatore. The chicken was prepared a bit differently from that which we are used to, fried chicken instead of baked or roasted. But, the chicken was delicious and cooked perfectly. 
     We did encounter one issue in that the cacciatore had red peppers and had a fairly strong red pepper taste, which my wife didn't like, but we switched dinners and I finished her cacciatore. It was great and she enjoyed the short ribs. The owner heard she didn't like the meal and offered to remove the cost from our bill, but I told him that I enjoyed the meal and that wasn't necessary. Instead he sent out some great desserts for us to try on him.
     In summary, our food was terrific, service was very good, and the owner took care of what could have been an unhappy experience. All was good."}

2 of my friends had the Pan Seared Scallops and my other friend had the Seared Red Snapper... All of which were fabulous dishes!

And to top it off, a pianist and cellist we playing in the background. It made for a great experience for our 1 dinner out together."}

{"text":"lovely romantic restaurant week dinner with hubby for Sat nite date nite!  parking is tough when this busy; we ended up parking at the bank.  got a nice table for 2 by the window quickly and then water immediately.  ordered the $8 prosecco and the nice loaf of bread with balsamic and olive oil arrived.  we both ordered  the delicious artichoke risotto for first course, they were  large servings- coulda split that and tried the crab cakes..  for dinner I enjoyed the zin braised short ribs (very tender) served with a few of the light gnocchi stuffed with asiago and brie - melt in your mouth.  hubbys large dinner plate consisted of the fried pork scallopini topped with mushrooms, pancetta and asparagus next to a huge mound of garlic mashed potatoes. we could not finish all that after the heavy risotto too!  then came the dessert which was a large slice of luscious chocolate mousse layered cake and a caramel gelato.  three course dinners for $33 pp plus 1 drink and tip = $95.  we felt the good food and service was worth it...oh and a couple got engaged there right in the middle of the dining room...fun!"}

{"text":"We are from California and were in town for a wedding.  I wanted to treat my husband to a night out - what a great restaurant!  We came on a Sunday evening and it wasn't very crowded around 8pm.  

The service is great, accommodating and attentive but not too attentive. 

It was restaurant week but we decided to order off the menu anyways.  I ordered the scallops - they were delicious.  My husband ordered the veal and he loved it.  The whole experience from the service, ambiance to the food was excellent.  

Next time we're in Scottsdale I'll be back to Tommy V's for dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"Came to this place twice in the space of a week and really loved it! The service was great and we were welcomed like old friends when we came in for the second time.  The food was delicious, but not out of this world.  The portions were slightly too big and both times my parents and I left very full.  However, I enjoyed every bite and would love to come back If Im ever in Phoenix again.  I would highly recommend it.  It's a big space with a well stocked bar.  They prices are a bit much for what you're getting but still very affordable."}
{"text":"Over The Top!
Great service, food and atmosphere. The eggplant and butternut squash was amazing as was the pasta bolognese. Our waiter was also exceptional, very eager to please and very accommodating. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Great food and happy hour!  Bartender Angel was very knowledgeable about menu items as well as wine.  Def.  will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and happy hour.. with the gorgeous weather we enjoy in Arizona the outside patio area runs the length of the building .. it makes for the perfect place to enjoy the happy hour menu after a long work week. 

On today's visit we started with lunch.. calamari to share.. lightly fried.. nice portion size.. had The Burger ($13) with the side of fries .. burger was nicely cooked, juicy.. loaded up with pancetta & blue cheese .. this is a big burger!! 

For dessert we shared the cannoli and the tiramisu .. both good desserts but nothing amazing .. the cream in the cannoli was slightly gritty and the base layer of the tiramisu was very wet.. flavors on both were good.

On the happy hour menu we enjoyed the prosciutto & fig reduction bruschetta.. and the smoked salmon with capers bruschetta.. both very good.. I really enjoyed the sweet and savory prosciutto &fig reduction .. the arugula added that nice spicy greens flavor to each bite!! Delish!

They have a long drink menu .. the fig mule was refreshing and light.. 

Staff here is friendly and took great care of us.. even when our stay went from lunch to five hours later into happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour.  What a deal!!  We sat at the bar and received excellent service from the cadre of bartenders/servers there.  Being first-timers, we didn't know you could also occupy a dining table and still \"do\" happy hour.  We might do that next time, but the bar experience was wonderful.  Good sized Caesar salad for $6 was really delicious.  And the artichoke risotto was not only an ample portion, but was fantastic.  Neither my wife nor I could finish our risottos, so we had them the next day for lunch as well.  That risotto is to die for.  And, for $9.50, the deal is amazing.  With two beers, two wines, two Caesar salads, and two risottos, the entire bill was only $53.  Now, THAT'S value."}
{"text":"Chicken parm was good but not great.  I was expecting awesome but the chicken was tougher than I was expecting. Caesar salad was better than average in addition to the tiramisu which they admit they do not make at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Update note: On 5/24/2016 we revisited Tommy V's and it was great once again except the lamb chops, which had an off flavor and consistency.  This is a real puzzle considering the quality of everything else.  Perhaps this is not their best item.

I am getting pretty selective as to where I bestow five stars, and Tommy V's did not have that Wow! factor that I usually want to see.  But it got straight A's in almost everything else.

Located in downtown Scottsdale, Tommy V's is a modern space with not much of an Italian look.  But it is bright, clean, not too noisy, comfortable and has a pretty good view for an \"urban\" kitchen.  The service was perfect -- quick, friendly, but not overbearing.

Everything we ate was at least pretty good, and the Pappardelle and the Cannoli were excellent.

But without anything to make you jump up and down with glee, Tommy V's also had to score well on value to justify the top rating.  And it did.  For the area (note qualification), it is quite reasonably priced, including even the drinks.

HINT:  I hear it has a great happy hour, but we missed that.

HINT:  Parking may be a bit tough in season on weekends."}
{"text":"i love the $5 happy hours. all the dishes are a great value and delicious!"}
{"text":"Incredible!  The bartender was so sweet and made the night for us!  The food was great and we would 100% come here again"}
{"text":"First timer to this restaurant but an old soul when it comes to Italian food. The restaurant has a nice pleasant vibe, I sat at the bar, it's long and comfortable and provides a great view (I love to see what other people are having). I ordered half a bottle of a Cabernet from Chile, they have a good offering of wines and not expensive at all, love the option of a half bottle. I also ordered the Tuscan Grill Mix, Lamb Chops, chicken and sausage They bring you bread and olive oil, the bread was a bit on the burned side, same as the table next to me, well actually theirs was almost black burned!. Then the food arrived, I was a bit disappointed to find a bit of skinny couple of lamb chops a very thin chicken breast a what resembled a think burned hotdog. Unfortunately the lamb was kind of dry and over cooked, same with the chicken, you would expect dry chicken breast at Olive garden but not here. It was not bad, well seasoned but far from where it should be. Disappointing. Desert menu needs a couple more offerings but that is my humble opinion, I ordered the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, I know this being an Italian restaurant I should probably had the Tiramisu or the cannoli but oh well, the cake was good, nothing special.
Bottom line, and my rating is always on function of this: would I come back? Probably not, there are way to many other options to try instead on spending this kid of money to try to find that good dish in this restaurant (probably there is a few) but not again."}
{"text":"Very good food, great service. Be aware, when you order shrimp, they will charge you $9 for 4 shrimp. Shrimp are expensive but not that expensive.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"This is by far, one of the best restaurants in Scottsdale Old Town. Their food is suburb! Their service is first rate-Kevin  and Angel are incredible! Their Happy Hour is one of the best values ever. We arranged for a large space around the bar for my BIG Birthday Bash-54 people showed up.  Zoran, the owner, was accommodating in every way.  Ask for the Halibut, the Calamari-work your way around the entire menu-you will never be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The experience from the setting,  service to the food was fantastic.   Had a great date night."}
{"text":"This place actually reminds me of a restaurant in Milan that I visited once.  Sure, there were all kinds of traditional trattorias and pizzerias but there were also these modern restaurants that had contemporary and sleek decor, who also presented a new perspective on Italian food.  Tommy V's falls in this latter category.

I really love how the main dining room has great windows to the street.  It's fun to look out and as a passerby one might think \"I wish I was in there\".  The moody lighting and hard wood floors give this place an elegant yet warm vibe.  The size of the restaurant is ample so this would make a great place to host a dinner party.

The food is Italian but you will not find all of the cliche Italian American dishes.  Instead diners are offered selections such as Bucatini and other plates that are more regional and similar to what you would get in Italy.   Oh yeah, pastas are hand made daily.  If this weren't enough, Tommy V's is affiliated with Tomaso's so many of the same techniques and elements are incorporated here.

If you want to experience a modern, elegant, yet friendly and warm Italian restaurant that serves a blend of modern and authentic Italian cuisine then I can't think of a much better choice than Tommy V's."}
{"text":"Well prepared, nicely plated, generous portion, tasty food.  Service is upper crust, smart and well timed. Hints of Italian cuisine with a solid backbone of American staples.  

I ate here twice, both dinners.  Re-said:  I over-ate here 2X because the food was so good & so big. 

Outdoor patio dining area faces an ugly parking lot & adjacent homely neighbor restaurant, but you'll forgive that when the food is placed before you.

Decent wine selection, full bar.  

Adult, serene dining in old town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The food here is flavorful and well presented.  The whole menu is thoughtful and consistent .  The decor is clean and minimal.   It's a bit modern and cold and the Italian movie star posters in the back are a bit cheesy.  The service is attentive but nothing special.  It doesn't seem like the waitstaff is especially well trained in knowing the menu and how to present it to customers. Also, the restaurant is really big and never seems to look full.  The owner is really nice and attentive to the customers."}
{"text":"We just decided to try another Italian restaurant in old town Scottsdale and tonight it was Tommy V's. We got there really early around 6:30 on a Saturday and there was only about two tables occupied. Really slow we thought but we were wrong cause everyone tries to get there before 8pm cause that's when the live band performs and tonight was a jazz band. 

Parking for us was really easy when you come early but after 7:30pm then forget it. It's a fairly small parking lot especially on a Saturday night. 

When we walked in, it looked really modern decor. Dark brown wooden floors, white table cloths, and huge mirrors on the walls. Very chic. Nice atmosphere. 

We were seated right away, greeted, and we got our drinks orders quickly. We always start off with the Fried Calamari. Our favorite. It was pretty good. Crispy and not over cooked. Tasted really good with the red sauce. They also provided bread with oil and vinegar. Bread was really good especially when you soak up that oil and vinegar. 

I had the Zin Braised Short Ribs and it came with spinach gnocchi. The short ribs were very tender and were fall off goodness. They give you two fairly big pieces. Not bad. The spinach gnocchi were cooked really good. Chewy in the middle and it was pretty good. I would have to say it was a pretty good meal. Not great but good. 

My wife had the Pacific Halibut and I snuck a few bites and she really enjoyed it. Pretty moist and tasted pretty good. My daughter got the Fettuccini Bolognese with a three meat sauce that came with veal, beef, & pork. She really likes it and was really raving about it. Usually she like to take some home for another meal but she liked it so much she ate it all. Enough said. Then my son got a special Shrimp & Lobster Fettuccini. Really fresh and really good. He gobbled it up and loved it. Raved about it too. So it must have been really good. 

We can never forget about dessert. I got a cappuccino and cannoli. Cappuccino was very good and the cannoli was out of this world. Very creamy. Not to sweet. Really good. We shared and everyone really liked it a lot. 

The service was exceptional. They took really good care of us. Filling water cups. Checking on our food and clearing out dishes in a timely manner. Really good service. 

When we first got there it was really quiet with some soothing music in the background. By the end of our meal the place packed up and it became pretty loud and seemed like everyone was waiting for the band to start playing. We left before the band started playing. So I would recommend coming around 7:30 to hear the live band. 

So they had exceptional service, good but not great food, great ambiance, with a pretty loud crowd. We really enjoyed our time at Tommy V's. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Stopped in to eat this week prior to a flight home the next day.   My wife and are from the New York metro area and know Italian food and this was certainly acceptable, not great but basic good. Service was excellent, but it was not overly busy. My only complaint and the reason this is not a four star review was the appetizer. We split the fried barrata app and the cheese was amazingly good. Have never seen fried barrata and enjoyed it. However, the fresh tomato's with basil that came with the dish were horrible. Unripe supermarket plum tomatoes that actually crunched when I bit into them. I mean how can you not source fresh local tomatoes in June?"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience, salad came without being mixed properly so all the dressing was on the plate underneath all the veggies. The clam linguine came as if there was a premix with way more clams than there were shells for... yuck"}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary because I was craving Italian food.  It was a Sunday night and the olympics were on so we asked to be seated at a table near the bar.  Service was actually really good - on point.  Loved the atmosphere but it felt too modern for Italian.  Drinks and bread served promptly.  I wanted a sangria and they brought me a peach Bellini.  It was way too sweet so I sent it back for a glass of wine.  We ordered the Caesar salad to split which was great.  Our pasta dishes were just ok.  I got the spaghetti and meatballs.  Pasta didn't seem like it was made fresh at all.  My husband got some seafood pasta dish and the scallops were pretty rubbery.  Seemed like they cater to an older crowd.  Overall I don't think we would return but glad we tried something different."}
{"text":"I've been to Tommy V's on a number of occasions. It as always been good. No, it has always been outstanding!  I have tried a number of different appetizers, main courses, and drinks (well, this may not be true . . . I almost 100% of the time get Margaritas!) and each time I am as pleased with my meal as I was the previous time. 

Go for an early dinner, or Happy Hour, before it gets crowded. It is a popular place to relax and unwind after a busy day in the trenches."}
{"text":"I had a very nice dinner here recently with a large group of people.  The waiter clearly knew his stuff, had a charming accent, and made excellent recommendations.  I wasn't very hungy, so he suggested the beet salad with goat cheese.  It was excellent, as was the bread they served with olive oil.  The cocktails and wine were reasonable and delicious, and the owner served us all complimentary guapa after dinner and came over to thank us for coming in.  We had a conversation on the patio afterwards, and he was clearly passionate about good food and scottsdale, and I'm thankful that he has moved into the neighborhood.  Will definitely return for dinner with the BF."}
{"text":"Tommy V's is a great place for a dinner for two. The noise level in the evening is only average. You can hold a conversation but it's not dead quiet. The wait staff is eager to please and the restaurant in a great location in old Town Scottsdale. Our waiter Efren helped us with our selections and the pasta trio was delicious. Husband had the special, a homemade canneloni that was amazingly light and delicious. We had a nice bottle of wine and appreciated the time given to choose our wine and dinner. The bread was delicious with virgin olive oil or dipping. The entree size was ample and plenty for us but not huge. I would have appreciated a bit more time before the entree arrived. Next time I will ask if we could enjoy our wine and hold the dinner for a bit. Will definitely visit again on our next trip."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful meal. Started with caprese salad and eat salads. Both were delicious. He ordered the bucatini and I got the shrimp and lobster fettuccine. Delicious. I recommend this restaurant highly. Our server, Nick, was great!"}
{"text":"Food was good and our server was nice, however after we paid he left and they immediately wanted us out.  It was only 10:05.., our reservation was at 8:30, they shouldn't take late reservations if that's what their going to do to their customers.  I felt very rushed and uncomfortable, I didn't even finish my wine...  would not go here again."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Tommy V's for a while. Not because I don't always have a great meal but more because there are just so many places to dine. Well we went back last weekend for desserts and it made me wonder what took us so long to go back there. This is a reasonable priced, great atmosphere, and good food place to go to. I am not going wait so long to go back again!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I threw my husband's 40th birthday party in their private room. I've thrown parties at restaurants before  but the service here, attention to detail and personal touches were ABOVE and BEYOND. The owner Zoran gave us MORE than what the original menu was. He was incredibly accommodating and took care of details personally every step of the way. The portions were overly abundant! Everyone at the party RAVED about the quality and taste of the food. Overall this was a 10 out of 5 star experience! Thank you head server Timonthy who even boxed up the remaining food, deserts and cake for me to take home. I could not be happier!!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't wowed. 

For my salad I had the caprese and thought it was ok. The tomatoes were somewhat green and lacked flavor. The overall flavor of the greens was good but it didn't catch my attention. 

The chicken piccata was a thicker breast than I prefer. I'd rather it be pounded thinner, and came with a side of pasta in a marinara-type sauce. Again, it didn't make me want to have it again. 

My partner had the bruschetta with prosciutto as her appetizer. She liked it and offered me a bite. It reminded me of a bacon sandwich, which was interesting, but again didn't inspire me to return and order it for myself. 

All in all, I thought it was so-so. I have places I like better and think I'll be visiting them instead of returning for a next time."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  The Burrata and the gnocchi were incredible!  You HAVE to try the pasta trio- it gives you a little taste of everything- and I strongly recommend ditching your diet and going for a meatball...or two.

Classy restaurant, great atmosphere, awesome food and outdoor seating!  What more could a girl ask for?  I guess, someone to pay the bill..."}
{"text":"Great Italian food. Nice environment, but no unnecessary pretense or snobbery.  Friendly staff. Definitely a favorite of mine for Italian fare."}
{"text":"The service was great and the prices were more reasonable than you'd expect. I had the Pasta Trio. It had the best gnocchi I've ever had."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Cannot get enough. Great menu and well priced. They strive for the ultimate dining experience and certainly succeed! They even have live music on the weekends! Need I say more..."}
{"text":"It was my very first time here and i am impressed. Was looking for a lovely place for dinner with firends and my husband found it on google. The food: AMAZING! Had the Lamb Chops and oh my! Wonderful. Ordered the Chef's Board to start, I recomend this to anybody with a small group of 4. Hit the spot! Friends had the Prawns and Lobster and Salmon. They told me it was good. THEN desert! I ordered the berrys and cream, which was light and fun to end an evening with. Friends ordered the Tiramisu and Torta Del La Nonna, which said it was wonderful. The waiter Tyler was very attentive to us and was knowledable about the menu, thanks Tyler. So if your *Thinking* about going, don't think, just go..."}
{"text":"We are on vacation from Connecticut and wanted to go out for great Italian food. The restaurant is excellent and the service is even better. 

Very Happy. Definitely come to Tommy Vs for great Italian food."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is wonderful and the atmosphere is terrific for a night out with a loved one. Plus the service is top notch. We had Joseph and he was amazing, addressing and anticipating our every need. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times with varying success. The first time was takeout:  chicken picatta and a ceasar salad. Both were great, especially the tender chicken and buttery lemon sauce. Next time we had the ravioli trio and the lobster and shrimp linguini. These were probably the best pasta dishes either of us have ever had. But THEN there was the third visit...where pretty much everything was wrong. We started with the lobster bisque which was watery, had shells/  cartilage in it, and was really spicy. No one told us in advance that it was spicy. We sent it back and the owner came out and argued with us--basically saying we were wrong about not liking the soup. Main course was the short rib sandwich and the chicken picatta again. Short rib and chicken were both dry as a bone and nearly inedible. Since we'd already been put in our place by the owner on the soup, we didn't feel comfortable sending back our entrees, even though they should have been returned. 

So I will probably not go back there due to inconsistencies, but 2/3 experiences were perfection so that's why I give 3 stars."}
{"text":"We met family in California and decided to road trip to Scottsdale for some hiking and warm weather. After a long day outside, we were looking for some good food and a carb overload. Tommy V's didn't disappoint! Their service and food were spot on. Tim, our waiter, was precise with firing up the food and super attentive- he was awesome! Chris who was the head of the House was so warm and welcoming, we loved him. The mussels were delicious and we loved our meals. All 6 of us enjoyed our different choices. We're definitely coming back when we make another trip out this way. Keep up the great work at Tommy V's!!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelper's for turning us on to Tommy V's! When we walked in the door & saw the white tablecloths & extensive wine storage racks  we were concerned that we were underdressed & that the prices would be high. Our fears were unfounded - it was very casual and the staff was very friendly. 

The wine list is wonderful! We settled on the Brancaia Tre  Super Tuscan that was delightful. For dinner I ordered the Hazelnut Risotto and it was fabulous; rich & creamy with mushrooms & hazelnut pieces. For dessert we shared the Copa de Amaretto, essentially a custard that was light and a wonderful finish to our dinner.

The portions were very large, we could have easily shared an entree.

The ambiance, service & high quality of Tommy V's food & wine list rate 5 stars from this Yelper."}
{"text":"Jimmy and I came here for dinner a few weeks back. The food was pretty delicious, but it was the service that really stood out.

Food:
Prince Edward Island Mussels - Butter, garlic, wine sauce plus mussles and crostini. How can you go wrong? Quite delectable.
I had the Pasta Trio which has a sampling of the mushroom tortelli (excellent sauce!), spinach ricotta ravioli, and my favorite, the brie, asiago, brown butter gnocchi. (1 each of the tortelli and ravioli, and 5 or 6 gnocchi).
J had the NY Steak which was covered in caramelized fennel, stewed tomatoes, and mascarpone cheese. His steak was ok, but I'm a minimalist when it comes to meat. I think the less toppings, the better. His steak had way too many flavors going on for my taste. He liked it though.

Anyway...the service. For whatever reason, this was our first meal of the day (...it was 7:30pm), and both of us were very hungry. So when my food came, J was in shock as to how little of a plate it was and whether or not I would be content with just that. He asked our waitress to bring over a menu so we could look to order another appetizer. Within minutes of her bringing the menu, the manager (I believe he was the manager - I could be wrong, he might be the owner) comes over and wants to know if there's something wrong or if there's anything he can do. J explains that he did not realize the portion would be so little for my pasta and how he thinks I need to eat more food (which granted, I did), so he wants to order another appetizer. The manager/owner cuts in saying he would gladly get me more of whichever pasta I liked the best (with no additional charge), because he did not want anyone leaving unsatisfied with their meal.
I picked the gnocchi and within a few minutes, a bowl of additional gnocchi was brought out to me. Hot, delicious, and tasty. And not to mention, the right amount for me to be content with my meal.

The manager/owner came by again towards the end of our meal just to check up on things, and proceeded to chat it up with J about how he should come check out their bar area, where you can also order from the main menu, but still catch whatever game is on. I'm sure J will be returning for HH one of these days.

I've eaten at many restaurants like this one, where the serving sizes are rather small, but I've come to accept that's just how these \"trendy\" types of restaurants are, and there's no getting around that. But rather than make the elaborate explanation/justification for why servings are so small, the manager/owner instead provided excellent customer service, which both of us found to be very refreshing."}
{"text":"Tremendous value! The food and service are superb and the check was a nice surprise. The atmosphere is modern and sophisticated, but attire is casual - a great spot for a date night."}
{"text":"We had a great time here for a low key birthday dinner. The service was spot on, the server's recommendations all proved to be excellent. 
We had the calamari and the chef's plate for apps. The plate was awesome while the calamari was average. The seafood risotto was dumbfounding as you couldn't even take a bite of the risotto without getting a piece of some sort of fish along with it - shrimp, scallops, lobster (by all means a good thing.)  The pasta trio was also very good. The mushroom ravioli was by far the star of the plate.
Great place, recommended for sure."}
{"text":"Chose this restaurant based on all the positive reviews but couldn't have had a more opposite experience. 

We made a reservation for 9:15pm due to a late flight arrival, and as we walked up the choice was already questionable considering the restaurant with over forty tables had only one table occupied by one lonely, sunburnt couple. The lack of patronage alone made us question eating there but as most restaurants close at 10pm on a weekday we felt a bit stuck.  

You'd think being one of two tables we would have received stellar service, maybe even annoyingly attentive...but think again. You'd even think they'd want to provide speedy service and get us out of there so they can end their shifts, wrong again. The wait staff seemed more concerned with drinking in the corner than serving us. While the appetizers came out in reasonable time, drinks were left low or empty, once the appetizer course was done the plates sat in front of us until the main course was ready, and we sat waiting for the main course for twenty minutes after the appetizer course. Remember we are THE ONLY people ordering food. Lastly, one of the entrees was their halibut dish, and despite being the only protein to cook for the entire restaurant the fish was over cooked by at least two minutes. If I lived here I'd make sure no one went here but as a weekend visitor I'll hope that my review can keep others from being swayed by the other historic positive reviews."}
{"text":"We we went here for dinner to celebrate a coworker and friends birthday after reading the yelp reviews, which all seemed positive.  Unfortunately our dinner was mediocre and service as well.  Our server did not seem to know the menu very well and the calamari was horrible. The scallops were ok, but the asparagus was soggy and did not have that great of flavor. Our friends ordered the linguine which they said was so so. Nice ambience and so do have to say the general manager was very nice as well... just not good enough food to go back. :-("}
{"text":"Fantastic experience fro late lunch and we will be back fro dinner next time in Scottsdale.

Friendly attentive staff, awesome food- had the Spaghetti Bolognese and the short rib grilled cheese that is to die for. Great bread and dipping oil/balsamic vinegar mix.

bonus was Peroni and Sonoma Cutrer by glass on the menu.

Special thanks to our waiter who gave me bag with ice for my shin (just hiked about 7 hours in past two days) so really appreciate it!"}
{"text":"First time there the other night.  Friday night, not very crowded for 7:30pm.  We were shown to a table in what looked like a back room - the table was not set, there was just a tablecloth and that was it.  The room is to the right as you walk in.  There were only 2 other tables in there and the windows were covered (no view) - it was weird so I immediately asked to be seated in the main part of the restaurant.  Decor seemed 'cheap' - just my initial impression.  Food was pretty good.  Pancetta wrapped shrimp app was good; Service was good.  Entrees were pretty good - Chicken Parm, Fettucine Bolognese all tasty, but not sure I would go back.  Caesar salad was a bit disappointing...asked for anchovies on the side - never delivered."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome.

My Fiance and I went to Tommy V's on Monday (4/16). We were presented with tasty bread with an oil and vinegar dip when we were seated. We were pleasantly surprised by the prices on their happy hour menu. We shared the Risotto Carbonara, Kobe Sliders and Kobe Stacks. 

The sliders and the stacks were both surprisingly inexpensive for Kobe Beef. They were melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and very similar but I liked the stacks better personally. The Rizzoto was creamy and delicious, served piping hot. They also have a great selection of $5 wine by the glass, and they let you try a sip to ensure you like it before they pour your glass.

Overall I was very impressed and I'm sure we'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I must eat here at least a couple of times a week.   Tommy Vs boasts an unrivaled wine selection both by the bottle and by the glass as well as  some of Scottsdale most amazing Italian fare.    Nicolas, Kevin, and Angel always take such great care us at the bar."}
{"text":"Last month my women's hockey team and I were in town for a tournament and we enjoyed an awesome dinner at Tommy V's.

From the first phone call to book the table to walking out the door at the end of the night, we were more than pleased.

We were given a table in the back private room, which was great because we can get a bit rowdy when the giggling starts. ;)

The waiter was awesome! He was humorous and treated us with fantastic banter along with excellent suggestions for dinner. It was restaurant week so the majority of us picked off of the limited 3-course meal menu. Everyone was pleased. I got the ravioli de zucca which was superb! I only wish there had been more raviolis on the plate!

Wonderful experience and excellent food!"}
{"text":"Came here for a work dinner. The main dishes were delicious. I had the Herb Lamb Chops with Brussel Sprouts and fingerling potatoes. The lamb was cooked to a perfect medium and the veggies were tender. Portions were large. 

We ordered 3 appetizers, 2 seafood and fried burrata. The cheese was ok but needed the olives to enhance the flavor. Would have liked it if there was a balsamic drizzle. 

Service was pretty good, although slow in refilling drinks. 

I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Great upscale atmosphere & food. The staff wasn't very eager, though. Very clean & interesting & unique menu."}
{"text":"It was a pleasant meal in a pleasant atmosphere but nothing exceptional. The beet salad was heavier on avocado than on beets and the pecans were turning bad; really shouldn't have been served. The eggplant torta was okay, but not something we'd go back for, although fresh ground pepper and decent parmigiana were plusses. My feeling is the eggplant should have been cut into thinner slices and of course cooking them in a wood burning often would have been the real deal. It was the dessert, however, that took away the extra half point, the one that would have moved us from a 3 1/2 and therefore a 3 to a 4. Quite simply, it tasted like commercial cake delivered by truck to a restaurant that didn't have its own pastry chef. Just blah."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Tomaso's since I was a teenager so was happy to try Tommy V's.  The Italian food here tastes authentic and delicious.  They have a large wine list.  I feel the only difference between Tommy V's and Tomaso's really is the decor.  Tomaso's has that old school Italian restaurant vibe.  Tommy V's has a modern contemporary interior with a few pictures of girls on the walls where all you can focus on are their boobs.  It was kinda funny that all three of us at dinner noticed it.
I had the eggplant torta and butternut squash ravioli.  The eggplant torta tasted to me like eggplant parmesan but in a lasagna type shape.  The butternut squash ravioli was divine.  I would love if I could just have a giant bowl of that!
We made reservations, but being that it was a Thursday night in the summer, they weren't really necessary.  
Their prices pretty much start at $15 and go up.  I noticed they have a decent happy hour menu if you are a bargain eater.  
This would be a fantastic date spot, but sit inside.  The patio would probably be nice during the day with friends, but there's nothing romantic about sharing a bottle of wine in front of the Grapevine and a parking lot.
Great Italian and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I came here on a fancy date and was def impressed. We ordered red wine, caprese and salmon. Everything was delicious and top notch. Has an upscale feel with white table cloths, live jazz music and overall atmosphere. If your looking to spend a lil and have a lovely date this is a good spot for that."}
{"text":"Pros:  Great location and great patio.

Cons:  Could use more fresh food items."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Well rounded menu. Good wine selection and nice atmosphere. Great location as it is within walking distance of Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We have lived in Scottsdale for 23 years & have always found it difficult to find good Italian food here.  We loved UnBacio, but alas, they are gone.  Fortunately, we have  found Tommy V's Urban Kitchen!  We've eaten there twice (plan on going back many more times) & love everything about the place.  The food is fantastic; the staff is friendly, professional & efficient; the restaurant is pretty; & the owner is very hands-on & makes himself accessible & known-- a delightfully friendly man!

When last there, my husband experienced a minor health issue & the quick action & genuine concern for my husband & myself was amazing!!  Unfortunately, paramedics needed to be called, but everyone at Tommy V's made sure to keep the incident low-key, so as to not upset the other diners & to insure we had our privacy & all our needs taken care of.  The whole incident was handled like a well orchestrated play.  Our continued thanks to Zoran & his entire staff for taking such compassionate care of us that night.

If you like VERY good Italian food, please try this place & be sure to tell your friends. I hope your evening contains less drama than ours did, and that you leave as anxious to return as we are."}
{"text":"I have been to Tommy V's a couple times before and have always enjoyed my time there.  This past weekend I decided to celebrate my birthday with a large group of friends at Tommy V's, and the restaurant was fantastic to us.

They have a large room at the back of the restaurant for large groups, which is where we were seated on saturday.  I love the room because there is curtain that closes it off from the rest of the restaurant, which provides a nice level of privacy.  When I walked to my table, I noticed that they printed out personalized menus for me, wishing me happy birthday!  I have never had that done for me before, and it was such a great gesture, made it instantly special for me.

As always the food was fantastic, and all my friends enjoyed their meals.  The service though, was impeccable.  The waiter was charismatic, and accommodating to my friends, even going above and beyond to make us happy.  I highly recommend Tommy V's if you have a large group dinner, or want to celebrate a special event, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great service, bad food. Had the shrimp risotto and my husband had the lobster and shrimp pasta. Both tasted kinda funky. Never going back."}
{"text":"We went there on Tuesday in the afternoon. The place is empty. It was happy hour. We got a sauté calamari with tomato sauce and garlic to start. It was amazing! A little bit spicy. We finish all the bread with the sauce left. The bread is good, too. Spaghetti Bolognese is perfect, just the way I like. The spaghetti is perfectly cooked. Risotto with Artichokes is wonderful, too."}
{"text":"wow love the revamped space! the last time I was here was when it use to be cafe carumba. tommys created a soothing resto with a large & lively patio.
meet up with Aileen b. for  a much needed happy hour and i enjoyed that five dollar wine (we both had whites).  i ordered the chicken panino which is on the happy hour menu and comes with fries.  i did like the chicken inside the panino but i didn't care for the bread because it was a little to greasy for my preference. i solved that by removing the top bread of the sandwich. next time if i order this i will ask for a healthier bread option that is not so greasy or just no bread. tasty food and nice place to enjoy HH drink for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the past few years and have always loved it.  My previous reviews were always five stars.  I went for dinner recently and did not enjoy it at all.....service was excellent but the food not so much.  Thinking it was a one-off, I just forgot about it and planned on going again.  Then I found out that a new chef was hired and the food is not the same.  I won't go back until they get rid of this chef.  I hope they do...this was truly one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale.  Very sad."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend. We got so lost. I don't know how we missed the entrance haha. We parked in the front and came in from the back. I don't know how we missed the door. 

White cloth, fine dine and wine. Very pretty inside. The food here was really good. The waitress was accommodating since I'm a vegetarian. She said I could modify some of the entrées. 

 The mozzarella caprese- it was really good. The cheese was so soft and the tomato was
 
the truffle Mac and cheese- oh my goshhhhh. ITS TO DIE FOR!!! If they had jalapeños. Omg. This place will be the place. I will always be here. Haha 

I was so full from the bread and the appetizer, I couldn't finish my entrée. I ordered the trio pasta. It was dry. The geese on top didn't melt yet. :( 

I will come for the Mac and cheese. Yasssssssss."}
{"text":"Solid four. Patio dining was excellent. Fire pits everywhere and great food. Server seemed new and did not know a lot about the menu. Not at a problem though as the food makes up for all. Great wine collection."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I went to this restaurant in the middle of the week so this review may not pertain to the weekends.  I have to admit when we arrived at the restaurant from the outside it is not overly impressive looking.  The crowd is definitely a little bit on the older side, but when you are out on a date that isn't necessarily a bad thing because it wasn't particularly noisy, but it wasn't too quiet.  First we split the baby beet salad which was quiet delicious, I would recommend it.  For our entrees we had the Butternut Squash Ravioli and the Chilean Sea Bass, both of which we enjoyed.  For dessert we had the Tiramisu, and while I'm not the biggest fan of the dessert this was my date's favorite dessert and she really liked it. The waiting staff was very helpful and helped us choose our entrees. I would definitely go back again, and recommend it for someone taking a person out on a date."}
{"text":"Our family of four had a very enjoyable time at Tommy V's. The service and food were just excellent, and the ambiance was lovely and relaxed. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Aww hate to go against the grain, but here we go.

It was dinnertime and we had some friends and family in town, who wanted the Old Town Scottsdale experience.  

Opened up my trusty Yelp app, I pulled up the search \"Best Restaurants\" in \"Old Town Scottsdale\": Tommy V's was #4 on the list, and that's what our guests chose.  This was my first trip to Tommy's so I was excited seeing they had a solid 4.5 Star rating on Yelp.  

I'll start by saying the restaurant itself was well decorated and had a nice atmosphere.  For 7:30 dinner on a Monday, the place was empty.  Our large party was seated near the entry way with the big glass windows.  That might have been a mistake.  It was HOT and felt as if there was no circulating air on our table.  Once our hot food came out I literally went into a hot flash and started pouring sweat.  I had to excuse myself and went to the bathroom to wipe my face down.  As I walked towards the rear of the building I could tell it was 15-20 degrees cooler and I immediately cooled off and was fine lol.  But, the table we sat at was noticeably hotter than the other side of the restaurant.

The Strawberry salad was excellent.  The use of feta cheese and the candied nuts with the vinaigrette was very tasty.  That was probably the most enjoyable thing I tried at Tommy V's.

I ordered the Filet Mignon for my main course, and it was ok.  I ordered it medium but it was over cooked along the entire outer part of the steak.  There were a few bites towards the center that were not over cooked and those bites were much more tasty, juicy and flavorful.  The over cooked bites just tasted like dried chewy beef, maybe I should order medium rare next time?  

In all honesty I was expecting more... The mixture of an over-cooked $34 steak and the hot temperatures made this a 2 star experience for myself, but our guests did enjoy themselves and enjoyed their meal. 

3 Stars"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch yesterday. Been before with work folks but first time with Mrs. Love the atmosphere and Patrick took really good care of us. They put a little different spin on the turkey club and the burger. Both very tasty but not traditional. I have also had the steak salad and the Cobb salad which are also very good. Overall good stuff and we will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary the other night. We had a wonderful experience and will definitely go back. 

The atmosphere was lovely; candlelight, music was loud enough to enjoy but not too loud for conversation. The live music was a neat touch but we sat outside on the patio and missed it. Nice to know they have that sort of thing but we weren't upset by missing it.

The food and service were fabulous. I am lactose intolerant and some places don't really pay close attention to my needs: this place did a great job with that. Our server made sure to give me good advice for what to order and substituted things where needed. Instead of feeling as though I was doing without or as though the meal was missing something, our dishes seemed as though they were meant to be served sans-milk products. They never made me feel as though I was putting them out, which can happen sometimes. My favorite thing I ate was the salmon and vegetables. They were seasoned and cooked to perfection. 

Great experience, attentive wait staff, accommodating chef. Can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"We had our rehearsal dinner at Tommy V's back in November.  Words cannot describe how grateful we are for the experience Zoran and his staff created for our closest friends and family. We were able to custom create a menu to work with our budget and everything turned out wonderful. Menus were even printed with our names and wedding date on them (sometimes just the little things make a big impression.) The private room was just the right size for our 30 guest and everyone sat comfortably. Thank you Tommy V's for  setting the stage for our wedding weekend!!"}
{"text":"Not only was the food absolutely delicious but the staff was extremely friendly and attentive!  The ambiance is quite lovely.  For dinner I enjoyed the calamari and then the pasta trio because I just couldn't pick one thing.....tortellini wild mushroom with portebello marscapone was off the hook...spinach ricotta truffle ravioli....gnocchi brie asiago cheese in brown butter sage sauce.....and for dessert best cannoli I have ever eaten out west....Their wine list is also quite extensive.  Make this your new place to frequent you won't be disappointed! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great service, food today was just average but I was crushed when I went to order my \"go to\" dessert - they no longer have the Limonchello Sorbet.  Don't think Tommy Vs will stay on the food rotation as much as it had in the past."}
{"text":"Went to Tommy V's for first time Saturday night. I'm from NYC and live in valley for 7 years. I've been critical of Italian restaurants out here but my wife and I were very pleased of our entire experience. Service and ambience were great. Food was spectacular and prices were very affordable. Eggplant torta was fantastic and fried burrata appetizer hit the spot! Lemoncello sorbet for desert was the perfect ending to a great meal.  I will definitely be returning and have already recommended it to a few of my friends."}
{"text":"I'm wrestling between 3 and 4 stars, but they had a live band playing Frank Sinatra and that's just damn romantical [yes I know I made that word up], so it gets 4. 

I loved the ambiance. Low lighting, not too loud/obnoxious (aside from what appeared to be a birthday party at a nearby table). It actually wasn't as terribly busy as I would've expected for a Friday night. Perfect for a late Valentine's dinner with the boy. 

The waitstaff was VERY friendly and attentive-almost too attentive. I know everyone has their preferences, but I'd prefer that the waiter not be at my table every 5 minutes. I know he was trying to be helpful in helping us decide what to order as we'd never been there before. Also, it seemed like every time I took a few sips of water, someone was coming by to top off my glass. I guess that's better than the waitstaff completely forgetting you and you feel as if you might die from dehydration. That might be a little dramatic but you know what I mean. 

For drinks, we ordered what I think was called the Urban Manhattan? It was certainly a Manhattan but I can't remember if that's the correct drink name. I don't typically order this drink-but it was quite delicious.

Onwards to the food! After going back and forth between the Amazing Pasta Trio and Eggplant Torta & Butternut Squash Ravioli, I went with the trio..because HEY! It says it's amazing. In the back of my head I was thinking, \"that could be an over hyped claim\". My boyfriend ordered the Bucatini Amatriciana. Our server complimented on us on our outstanding choices..they really do talk up their menu items as other's have noted.

Our food arrived rather quickly. Portion size was little to be desired. I wasn't starving but.... seriously. The amount of food did not justify the price. It was delicious, don't get me wrong! I've eaten at enough upscale prices that you're not going to get a lot because you're getting quality food. I just felt as though it would be best listed as a \"small plate\".  It was some of the best pasta I've ever eaten, so I have to give credit where it is due. Boyfriend's Bucatini Amatriciana appeared to have a lot more to it and he said it was quite delicious-although he did feel bad for me with what little amount of food I had received. Too bad it had bacon in it, or I would've had some of his for myself. 

Overall, it was a very pleasant dining experience. Great waitstaff and delicious food despite the few issues I had with the place. I would go back again! I'm a pasta junkie!"}
{"text":"Old school vibe and dinner options here. Semi-pricey overall, but the food is moderate to good. Shared some calamari (average), pasta trio (good), and short ribs (really good). Three stars for this place simply because there was no element that wowed me, it really came across as average and not a place I'd see myself making an effort to come back to."}
{"text":"I went here last night with the BF. The place had some very good points, but also a lot of points that need improvement. So we got there early for our reservation, but were seated anyway...good point. We were sat at a high top table....but our menus and the wine list were too big to fit on the table, making for awkward shuffling of menus, trying not to knock anything off of the high top table...not the best planning on their part. The place is very loud, as the decor is kind if industrial and all of the sounds bounce around a lot. I got a glass of the riesling and it was very good. The bread they brought out was good, I liked that it was warm and toasted, I wish the oil had more vinegar in it, but it was tasty all the same.  I ordered the short ribs and the BF got the capellini. The capellini was actually very good....the sauce had a very robust flavor, even a little spicy and the portion was big. The short ribs were kind of meh. I thought the flavor was fine, but they could be cooked longer. There was a ton of fat still on the ribs (usually it has largely melted away by the time they are served) and although I did NOT have to use a knife, I had to work very hard with my fork to eat them....which should never be the case with braised short rib. The gnocchi that came with the rib, however, was very good.... it was a stuffed gnocchi, which I have never had before. We ordered the tiramisu for dessert and thought that the tiramisu itself was good, very light and airy, but with a lot of espresso flavor, but they plated it with very pretty lines of strawberry sauce and chocolate. The strawberry sauce had a strange flavor....not good, and the bites with it (which were many of them) had a strange flavor from the sauce, I saw the pic on here with the tiramisu in a bowl and the sauces on the side....that would have been the perfect presentation so we could opt out of the strawberry. So anyway, the place had some serious highs (great pasta), but also a lot of lows, which made me feel that it wouldn't be worth the cost to return in the near future."}
{"text":"I came here for a late lunch with my friend. We totally missed the front entrance. Lol.

Everything was actually really good here. We started with the mozzarella caprese. This was good and tasted very fresh. For my entree I ordered the pan seared salmon. This was a pretty big portion and I loved it!! I was only able to get through about half of it. I also ordered the Godiva chocolate martini which was quite tasty!! 

The interior is nicely decorated and it's a very cute date spot. The customer service was also good. It was a bit pricey but you definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Bread is amazing. Carpaccio Tenderloin was a 10/10. Great ambiance for a date.
Calamari was really tender. The caper aioli is a must. Ask for Dillon, he took great care of us!"}
{"text":"We went here with a group for my girlfriend's birthday and had nothing but great things to say about the place when we left.

Upon arrival everyone on staff new it was her Birthday and promptly wished her a happy birthday before we even sat down. The menus, created just for our party also had her name on them with a celebratory theme. Sure its a small detail but the amount of effort they put in to make her feel special was truly top notch.

On top of the amazing customer service the food was top notch and  well prepared. I recommend the Filet if your willing to spend the extra coin for it. Easily one of the best I've had in town.

Overall, in case you can't already tell, this place earns its five star rating from me and I wouldn't hesitate to send anyone back here!"}
{"text":"First off, I have to say that I didn't eat here during this visit, so this review is strictly regarding the atmosphere, impressions of the menu, and the bar at 7pm on a Saturday night.
It was pouring down rain on the Saturday night I entered Tommy V's Urban Kitchen from the awkwardly situated Indian school road entrance.  I walked directly into the dining room adjacent to the bar from what appears - from a pedestrian perspective, to be the main entrance. No one at the very sparely populated bar, or the less than half full dining room, seemed to notice my arrival - including the abundant wait staff or bartender. 
My first impression was that the establishment is nicely appointed, and makes a good attempt at an urban upscale feeling.  The menu however, seemed to be somewhat unsurprising and full of what I've come to regard as tired old scottsdale standards. There's mussels, and gnocchi, and steaks oh my! As I glanced at the massive, bound text that were eventually laid out before me on the bar by the nearly mute bartender;  I noted that the prices seemed rather inflated. Everything seemed closer to the $$$ range, than the $$ listed on Yelp.  Perhaps the prices are designed to support the over abundance of staff - I counted four bus boys, three waiters and a hostess just milling around, and reinforce the idea that this is \"upscale dining\"?  
The bartender had as much personality as the bowl of corks on the bar (corks in a bowl, 2005 called to say you're out of date...) and though I'm no spring chicken, I'm sure I was way more than three standard deviations below the average age I observed on this particular Saturday night. I have to say, They do make a good manhattan, but it's delivered without the slightest bit of soul, and the clientele felt more like retirement home than 7pm on a Saturday night.
The food may be wonderful, but I'm skeptical just based on the menu and Saturday night \"dinner rush\" crowd that has any dining room less than a quarter full.
All that being said, I'll give it another shot and try the food, more based on the plethora of positive reviews and vicinity to my typical dinner out location(s) than anything else.  Hey, maybe i'm wrong - i doubt it, but it could happen.  However, on first impression, this place looks perfect if you are looking for a  \"fancy-looking place\" that isn't too busy on a Saturday night.  The kind of non-chain establishment place where your slightly upscale parents will feel comfortable, and maybe they'll think you've actually become an adult when you pick up that tab."}
{"text":"Excelent food and service. It is NOT a place for kids but they didn't mind our toddler, his noise nor his mess."}
{"text":"Went here for our last night in Scottsdale, figured we would do a very nice dinner. This place did not disappoint! From our lovely waitress Michelle being so wonderful with recommendations and also surprising me with a early birthday dessert (so sweet, my birthday is tomorrow) and the very scrumptious meal. We will definitely be back next year when we are in town!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Very modern and contemporary. Great service. They had an oval table that seats six. You don't see that too many places and was perfect for our business lunch. Their \"happy hour\" menu which is served all day is really just their \"lunch menu,\" but a great selection nonetheless. 

I had the Panino Caprese ($9.50) which was more bread than mozzarella, prosciutto cotto, basil or tomato. A disapointment since the mozzarella and prosciutto on the Chef's Board were delicious. Plus it was very greasy. My colleagues had the Risotto with Artichokes ($9.50) and the Rigatoni al Ragu ($7.50) which they both really enjoyed. 

Service was top notch and decor was very inviting. I would definitely go back and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed our time here. We arrived just after opening and ordered from the lunch menu. We told the waiter that we would like the panzanella beef tenderloin salad to share and also ordered risotto with artichokes, and the grilled cheese with short ribs sandwich. 

The waiter delivered the salad on two plates (which was unexpected and a nice touch) with the beef tenderloin delicious and prepared as ordered (medium). My wife enjoyed the risotto with artichoke which was also good. I would definitely order it again, but think bacon would be a nice addition. Next time I will ask if they could accommodate this. My grill cheese with short ribs was great. The caramelized onions complimented the flavor nicely. 

Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends while visiting Scottsdale for a weekend and the food was just spectacular! I ordered the lobster risotto and went to heaven. It was definitely one of the highlights of my short visit."}
{"text":"Brazed beef spare ribs were excellent, crab cakes were not - too greasy, too much bread, too thin. I prefer the big lumps of crap without breading.  

The red meat sauce was amazing.  Good drinks, great ambient live jazz."}
{"text":"Old Scottsdale money hanging out here with a slightly dated decor. 

My friend was happy with her salmon entree. Our other friend had a pork chop special. He said one pork chop was awesome and the other was overdone. 

I was disappointed with my linguini with clams. It was served as almost a soup with a ton of liquid that had no flavor. 

The beet salad was good."}
{"text":"Wow, this place rocks! I have been there twice, once for lunch and then again for early dinner.  They have a full menu for happy hour which runs most days from 11:30-6:30 and an outstanding wine list, many of these wines are on special for $5 during the happy time.  The menu itself had so many choices it was hard to decide on what to order.  We ended up with Rigatoni chicken that I had to come back for with a second visit, and we also ordered the manchego sandwich, recommended by our waiter.  They have a nice seating area at the bar, and also an outdoor patio.  They have only been open 3 months but this one is a  winner with outstanding food and reasonable prices!!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience here. Thomas took great care of us. It was my moms 75th birthday and a party of 9 all ready to enjoy. 

We had a couple apps like the white sardines and mussels. Both excellent. The entrees ranged from lobster and crab linguine to the ravioli two ways to the lamb chops and short ribs. Everything was spot on... flavorful and the presentation was fabulous. 

Super large patio seating that was popular and the inside is nice and just the right amount of sophistication. 

Will return without a doubt."}
{"text":"Tommy V's is a fun spot for a casual relaxing dinner. I went with a group of three coworkers and it was a decent location. We have the buchitini to start and it was surprisingly small but definitely tasty. I also ordered a cocktail that ended up being way too sweet and I had to send it back. The wait staff redid the cocktail for me, however it was still super sweet so they offered to comp me for it at the end of the meal. For the main meal I had the three pastas dish which was good but nothing stellar or imaginative. The gnocchi was defintiely the star of the dish and something I would go back for. For dessert I ended up having an expresso martini which was delicious and definitely something to try.

Overall, good but there are better places in town I would say with a more imaginative menu."}
{"text":"Love the creativity here. Great happy hour menu, and as well great menu all around. Great atmosphere, clean, modern. The staff was very accommodating to my father in a wheelchair as well. Food was A+, absolutely no complaints and I had a few different dishes on the menu. Even gluten-free pasta marinara was very good and flavorful."}
{"text":"It on a very fun street with lots of nightlife! Very fun scene! Everything was delicious! A nice twist on the classic italian that gives the food a fresh feel! Our waiter was great too! And the owner personally came to make sure we enjoyed our meal!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 9 so we're able to try several dishes. 
Steak, red snapper and scallops are well proportioned and cooked perfectly .
Wine list was large and had reasonable prices. We had a Cab blend and it was perfect.
Only surprise was how they served the polenta with the snapper. I much prefer a creamer version with cheese and then plate the filet. Here they had an almost mash potato like on the side.
Attentive and friendly Staff"}
{"text":"Tommy V's Urban Kitchen and Bar completely understands what it takes to be a local restaurant that is successful. Its not just about the food, or just the drinks etc...its the whole package and that's exactly what you get at Tommy V's! 
I have dined here many times, always impressed with the Mahi Mahi daily feature, with lemony butter sauces and delightful grilled fingerling potatoes, as well as the Zin Braised Short Ribs with Aromatic Vegetables, Asiago & DELICIOUS Spinach Gnocchi. Exquisite wine selections that beautifully pairs with the cuisine top it all off. I love arriving early evening because the restaurant glows beautifully in the evening dusk light and with GM Zoran greeting every guest as the arrive, you feel as if you have arrived at home. 
I had the pleasure of attending last weekend's Rusack Wine dinner of five wonderful courses that took your palate on a fantastic journey of flavors, textures and perfectly paired wines! The first course of Crab Cakes paired with a Santa Ynez Valley Sauv Blanc was a wonderful start to the meal- the wine was just crisp enough to mate with the lovely tastes of the cakes. Second course was a just large enough portion of Orrechiette pasta w sautéed scallops and shrimp in a tomato cream sauce paired with a lovely Santa Barbara Chardonnay that was just oaky enough to stand up wonderfully to the pasta dish. Third course was beautiful piece of Mahi Mahi served with a wonderful veggie Ragu- lentils, mushrooms, brussel sprouts...was delicious and I couldn't stop eating it- even though I knew we had 2 more courses to go! The wine paired with the Mahi Mahi was a Pinot Noir from Santa Barbara, which seems counterintuitive but master mind Zoran who did the food pairings was spot on- the richness of the Ragu and texture of the Mahi worked beautifully as a team. The Main Course was Zin Braised Short Ribs paired with an escarole and white bean salad that was a lovely partner to the hearty short ribs, all the flavors mingled together well. A bold Ballard Canyon estate Syrah was paired with the Main course, which was a lovely finale to the main courses. Dessert was heavenly! A limoncello sorbet paired with a light and fresh dessert wine by the name of La Fleur Renaissance Sauternes.
All in all, Tommy V's is the whole package. Great food, wine and cocktails, ambiance, live jazz and of course wonderful staff- the GM Zoran will greet you at the door and ensure a perfect experience. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner and it was fantastic! Food and service was stellar. Vania our server was more than gracious. Atmosphere made you want to linger. A definite return when we come back from LA"}
{"text":"Wonderful Calamari!!

I've become a regular at Tommy V's because I LOVE their Calamari. My favorite meal there is Fried Calamari and a yummy Caesar salad with a glass of wine. Their happy your starts at 3:00 pm each day, and so having lunch from the happy hour menu is a first rate deal.

It is a lovely spot, and the service is outstanding. An additional plus for this Old Town Scottsdale restaurant is that they have their own parking lot."}
{"text":"To be candid I had tried to avoid this place for a long time, not for any particular reason just because the place was so non descript looking, even the name wasn't particularly exciting. How good can it be I thought, it looks so boring.

Boy was I wrong, my guy and I went for dinner happy hour and filled up on delicious crostini and I have to tell you one of the best spaghetti bolognese bowls I have ever had.  Totally unexpected, the meaty sauce was perfectly seasoned, rich and flavorful and oh so comforting.  A basic done to the highest degree.  A surprise I fell in love with and thought about days after.  Thank you Tommy's Vs, I look forward to coming back and exploring the rest of your menu if I can tear myself away from that heavenly bolognese. :)"}
{"text":"Short ribs, butternut squash ravioli, pear baby green salad. Done, done, and done. Great service from a very accommodating staff."}
{"text":"Was good. I like the seafood entrees. I'd ask for a little leaner salmon cut and a less creamy rice bed. Also, how about warm bread with oil and vinaigrette. The bread wasn't warm and only served with oil. Just a suggestion."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent meal at Tommy V's. The food and wine were excellent (I had the Chicken Marsala) as was the service.  Portions were good and the price was fair. I would go there again in a minute."}
{"text":"Came here with a coworker while in town.... GREAT food and friendly service. I had the scallops and they were just heavenly. Definetly check them out!"}
{"text":"Best Italian I have had in Scottsdale. Period.
Entire experience was perfect for a busy Saturday night. I dream of the bucatini. Please save room for desert. Plus live music? I feel like I owe them more money for the incredible experience. Wow."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short. Came here with a group of 8 for a birthday dinner. You would think a highly rated, nice Scottsdale restaurant to be pleasant to dine at. The thermostat read 81 but it felt like 85. Everyone was sweating all night and I could see people at other tables constantly wipe their foreheads. I asked the server if their ac was broken and was given the rudest look. He said he would see if he can do something but it was hot for  the entire two hours we were there. The server forgot our beer order. most of the table ordered a dish on the special menu that said it had crab, lobster, etc. but when we got the dish, the amount of seafood for the price was VERY DISAPPOINTING and the flavor wasn't anything special. The live band and the bread they give you was probably the best thing about this place. All 8 of us agreed we would NOT be coming back here.."}
{"text":"We were a group of 7, and I had cioppino.
Service was great, and we loved the atmosphere. Very cozy and comfortable to spend a good time with your family and friends.
Cioppino was good. I liked the source though seafood was not great, but good. However, this is a restaurant in AZ, not Monterrey. Compared to other restaurants in AZ serving seafood, I would say this restaurant is doing their best.
Highly recommended for special events."}
{"text":"Brought some out of town friends in for lunch this afternoon. A tall girl with a long dark pony tail waited on my group. Service was quick, seemless, and very pleasant. Katie, I believe was her name, made my out of town guests feel at home and explained the dishes on the menu that they weren't quite familiar with in perfect detail while giving her own suggestions. We started with the Carpaccio, which was excellent, and then moved on to our main courses. The food, the service, and the patio setting was on point. Not my first time at Tommy V's and won't be my last. This recent visit was the best so far, though."}
