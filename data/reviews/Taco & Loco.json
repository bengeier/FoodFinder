{"text":"As 90% of Mexican restaurants in Montreal, the food is not really Mexican or anywhere near authentic. Avoid \"Tacos al pastor\" they are an insult to anyone that has ever tried the real thing: the meat is not cooked shawarma style like in Mexico, the seasoning does not resemble at all, the pineapple comes from a can, and they don't even have salsa for it.  The service from one of the servers was extremely rude but the other server was aware of this and made his best effort to make it up. I wonder why the chef or owner felt the need to serve some bizarre dishes and just name them as if the name alone would make them authentic. Why don't you just simply say : it's Mexican inspired, or tex mex? Most restauranteurs have the pre conceived notion than Canadians won't like authentic Mexican food, but most Canadians I know love the real thing when they try it. Hopefully one day they will take a hint!"}
{"text":"Hmmm no not for me. I had the burrito lunch special and it was okay but not something I would go back for.   The burrito itself was leaking some fatty liquid that I am still unsure of..There was hardly any cheese on top and it had some tomato sauce reminiscent of canned sauce. Taste wise it was pretty good but the pork was unfortunately overcooked and on the tough side.   The service was friendly, within minutes the waiter greeted me and brought out a glass of water as well as tortilla chips and salsa. This being said, we were only two patrons on the terrace even though it was a lovely day out... must have been an indicator.. hmm"}
{"text":"Very good food. Kids liked tacos and fajita. Chicken quesadilla tasted great. Service a little slow, but food is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Worst. Burrito. Ever.   I had lunch there today and ordered the Grilled Chicken Burrito. It was, by far, the worst burrito I have ever had. Somehow, it was very watery. I don't even know how that is possible."}
{"text":"J'y était déjà aller un soir pour combler un petit creux et j'ai essayé leur nachos. C'était très bon et que dire de leur guacamole faite maison: un vrai délice. J'y suis retourné plus tard pour un souper et j'ai été très satisfait. Le menu n'est pas trop énorme, il offre de la variété pour ceux qui aime moins la cuisine épicé, les coktail et le choix de vin sont très bon et le service était très agréable. Il faut dire que nous étions presque seul dans le restaurants alors il était facile d'engager la conversation avec le serveur, qui a été de bon conseil et de bonne compagnie. Le seul bémol serait les télévisions dans le restaurant qui casse un peu l'ambiance à mon avis, mais si vous tenez à suivre le déroulement de la partie pendant votre souper, c'est parfait pour vous."}
{"text":"Good food and great service!  My friend and I both enjoyed our meals.  The atmosphere is nice, especially if you sit out on the patio during the summer.  It's a great place to people watch while sipping margaritas. The waitress and owner were both friendly and I would definitely go back."}
