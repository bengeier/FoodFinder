{"text":"Don't confuse the restaurant with the hotel!  The restaurant is on the first floor of the restaurant.  It is bistro style and the menu and beer selection are excellent.  The staff are great although very busy so service is a bit slow.  We also tried the Michaud chocolate cake which was out of this world good!

We really recommend this bistro restaurant.  Seating is quite close but everyone was friendly and helpful in helping us order despite our poor French.  

This being said though, the hotel is not recommended.  Eat here and sleep elsewhere!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I had in Gaspesie. Maria is a cute town with a lot of spunk, This spot reflects that spunk. The grocery is high priced but high quality as well. Great options for vegetarians."}

{"text":"Nevermind the mountains and the sea, the food at the auberge is reason enough to visit the Gaspe region.  The bay of chaleur soup is out of this world and makes a fantastic meal for any seafood lover.  I have commercially fished in Maine and Alaska and eaten all over Montreal, but none of those places come close to the quality and flavor found here.  The Arctic char was also delicious.  We literally drove three hours out of our way to eat here again.  Correction to the char: it had Cherrywood syrup, not birch."}
