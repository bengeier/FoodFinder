{"text":"The food is good...nothing great mind you, but worth the price.  Wait...worth the original price!!!  The website (as I found out today) has not been updated since the January raise of prices.  What I though was going to be a lunch for $8 + tax turned into a $10 + tax meal.  If you order carry-out and you look on the website and it says one price, you order, then you pick up and told another price, that is shameful.  Not going there again...and as for the food again, it is good, but all the lunch dishes have the same zucchini, broccoli, and peppers in all of the dishes, just different flavors added.  Not bad by any means, just not worth $11 for lunch (ESPECIALLY thinking it was going to be $8.50)"}
{"text":"Group of six for lunch.  For every employee we encountered, they acted like it was the first hour of their first day on the job.  Truly the worst service I have had from a restaurant in years.   Knowledge about menu items was zip, dishes came out one at a time with no concept that dining together was the goal.  No explanations offered.  Food was just ok."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had in Charlotte ! The owner has no sense of customer experience !   They won't honor your groupon ! Told me that if I would have set one table over I could have used it ... Knowing I purchased it while setting in their booth !   Also, asked for 3 things that never showed up on my table, had to ask for them 3 to 4 times and he still charged me. Told them I'm not coming back and he says \"ok\" ..."}
{"text":"Awesome food, our waiter Gene was the coolest, presentation was amazing."}
{"text":"I met a girlfriend here for dinner before heading to a concert at the Knight theater. I really wanted to give this place 2 and a half stars. Its not strong enough for three, but two is a little harsh. The place was okay, but I wouldn't go back.  My drink, the blushing kiss was pretty good, but I wouldn't order it again. I actually prefer wine, but the wine list was limited.  We started with two appetizers: the calamari and the Thai ceviche. The calamari was good and the ceviche was interesting. It was edible, but I wouldn't order it again.    We had the cherry blossom roll, which was good. But it wasn't good enough for me to choose this place over other sushi restaurants in Charlotte. We also had a fancy spicy tuna roll (forgot the name), which was just okay.   Regarding the atmosphere, I'll give them credit for the effort. It's somewhat modern and trendy. However the tablecloth across from us had several stains on it and the window seal beside us was dusty. I realize these may seem like minor points to some people. But I definitely prefer a cleaner environment when eating sushi.   Overall, it was a decent meal in a convenient location. But I wouldn't return and I wouldn't recommend it. There are lots of restaurants in the area that are much better."}
{"text":"I've been here twice (both times on a Friday night). The first time was good - reasonable wait time for food/drinks. The second time, however, was rather disappointing. It took approximately 35-40 minutes after we placed our order for the food to arrive (restaurant was moderately full). The prices are not bad for uptown and I would say the sushi is above average, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"A great ambiance to meet with old friends. The decorations were minimalist, simple and not overdone.  Excellent food and applicable to any adult age group; a very nice restaurant but affordable and not over the top. They could consider offering smaller portions for dinner (not often that I say too much food...!), but definitely not a bad thing. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Once again Emzy has delivered some of the best sushi I have had. Truly Delicious! With a large group of people it is sometimes hard to accommodate the multiple tastes without compromising the flavor and integrity of the food. Emzy has a wonderful mix of flavor, heat, and freshness. We made a point of coming over when we came back to Charlotte from Washington DC because we had such a good experience last time. Thank you for once again making our trip to Charlotte great!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that if I could have chosen to give them zero or negative stars, I would have.  We had a group of about 12 people wanting to go to lunch at Emzy. One member of our group called ahead to try to make a reservation, and they informed her that they did not take reservations but we could give notice of when we were coming so they would be aware.  Five members of our group got there a few minutes earlier than the rest. We told the hostess we had a large group and had called ahead. She asked us \"party of 8, right?\" We told her we had more than 8, probably around 12. Without asking us our name or the reservation/call ahead name, she insisting that the 'girl' who called told her there were 8 people (once again not mentioning what the name of the girl was). So, we were seated at a table for 8.   After having been seated for 15 minutes, the waiter and two hostesses came over to the end of the table and began having a (loud) discussion amongst themselves about how we were not the party that called ahead, and had taken their reservation. *But wait, I thought they didn't take reservations?*   The waitress then tried to blame our party, stating that we told her we were there under the party for 'Danielle,' and we needed to move tables. We all kindly got up, although it was in fact NOT our fault we were seated at the wrong table under the wrong name because the HOSTESS did not ask us for a party name and wrongly assumed who we were with. She just sat us there.   As soon as we got up the hostess walked away, seated the \"correct\" party of 8 for Danielle, and never gave us a second glance. We stood awkwardly next to the table that we were originally told was ours, waiting for the hostess or anyone to tell us where we could sit. Another table was never provided. The entire staff proceeded to ignore our group standing in the middle of the restaurant. After standing for about 5 minutes awkwardly in the middle of the restaurant, watching the hostess seat table after table of people walking in, a member of our group finally walked up to her and asked for a table.   The hostess proceeded to tell us it would be a 15 minute wait... even though we called for a reservation, were previously seated, and got kicked out of a table. REALLY? Not only did she not thoroughly check the name of the party we were with (which would have prevented the entire situation from happening), she attempted to place blame on us for 'taking' another person's reservation, and then did not provide us with another table after telling us to get up from the table that SHE wrongfully sat us at.   They also had no record of our party calling ahead, but somehow were able to have an actual reservation on record for another party?   One of the members of our group went to talk to the hostess. She asked her why our party now had to wait for a table when we called ahead, were seated (because she just asked if we were 'the party', never asked our party name, or if we were with 'Danielle'), were told to move, and then weren't given another table (because she ignored us as we stood and sat other tables until the restaurant was full). She then to tried to say that it was our fault for taking Danielle's reservation.* Let the record show that the name Danielle was FIRST heard when they were kicking us out of the table.*  Our group member proceeded to say that no mention of a Danielle occurred, and even so, why were we kicked out of a table and then not given another one automatically, or even put on the list to be seated next, but were ignored instead. Then our group member proceeded to ask why there wasn't a reservation or even a mention of our party coming in at noon and the hostess asked if we even called the correct restaurant, which we know occurred as there are multiple witnesses to the call. The hostess continued to keep saying we claimed to be in Danielle's party, we were in the wrong.   At no point during any of this were we apologized to, compensated for our wasted time, or even given a smile except by the waiter that got us waters when he thought we were \"Danielle's\" group. I don't know if this establishment felt like they could treat us so poorly because we were a group of twenty/twenty-one year olds, or if the staff members we dealt with were as unintelligent as they appeared.   The incompetency that we witnessed amongst the staff and especially from the hostess was utterly disturbing and enough to ensure that never in my life will I ever step foot into that restaurant again."}
{"text":"My husband, his co-worker, and myself were looking for a new place to try for lunch in Uptown Charlotte.  We called Emzy and asked if we can use a Groupon for lunch.  The lady who answered the phone put us on hold to go ask, and came back and said yes.  We purchased the Groupon and walked through the snow storm to have lunch.  When we arrived, while starting to place our order, we told the waitress we have a Groupon.  She said you can't use it during lunch hours.  We explained that we had just called 30 minutes prior and were told we could use it for lunch or dinner.  She got the Manager who very rudely told us we couldn't.  We requested that he make an exception since we called and were told yes, and walked through the storm to try Emzy for the first time.  He told us that it couldn't be done.  We asked if he could take the $15 off the bill since his staff gave us the wrong information and that was the total we paid for the Groupon.  He said no and walked away from us.  We decided to leave, and on the way out told him that this was a poor first (and last) experience at his restaurant.  He just shrugged his shoulders.  I have never been treated so poorly, especially by a Manager.  There are dozens of other restaurants in Uptown Charlotte that would be happy to have our business.  We will never eat at Emzy due to the horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Thanks for all of the rice... This place has been mediocre in the past, but after my experience today I may never go back.  I ordered the \"Hella Hot Roll\" which is priced at $10 and there was literally nothing in the middle of the sushi roll.  It was like eating a ball of rice with \"some\" spicy tuna on top with a jalapeno slice.  I can't believe I just paid $15 for lunch there.  Total rip off.  They get a good crowd because of location, but they need to do some sort of quality check on the sushi rolls coming out of the kitchen.  If they are running low on fish, then tell your customers so we can order something else."}
{"text":"The owner is very unprofessional. I have heard the food is decent but after calling in and trying to do a take out order- I will not be ordering from here in the future after the way I was treated."}
{"text":"WORST SUSHI I'VE EVER TRIED.   The location of Emzy is good, right under the Duke Energy Center. The decor inside looks like they are in the middle of refurbishing it. The staff are disinterested and weren't helpful- preferring to pick their nails.   The sushi was warm when we got it so we sent it back and walked out. Do yourself a favor don't come here."}
{"text":"Food was amazing loved everything we ordered!!  The hibachi chicken was great for the kids so the hub and I got a great meal without a kids menu!!! But the thing that kept it from a 5 star is the service. Took forever to get everything even water which was never refilled!  There appeared to only be 1 server on and he was running but since it was right before Fan Fest it was very busy. Should have had more staff on"}
{"text":"Great food and staff!!! Sushi is amazing...I love the scenery too and the location is walking distance from other places as well. Parking is validated for the parking garage. Me and my friends will continue to go to this restaurant on a regular!!"}
{"text":"FOOD = FABULOUS, Service, not so much.  The sushi was fresh, flavorful and great proportions!  However, server was slow to take our drink order, bring drinks, food order, bring food, etc.  May have just been a bad staff night.  The area has construction going on, so it was a little hard to find, with no view."}
{"text":"Came to EMZY because we had a coupon.. seems to be the common yelp theme.  I think the best way to describe this place is \"I would only come here if I had a coupon\". It was average, Not bad and not great; there's only so much you can do to make a sushi roll bad, so the food was fine, what makes this place a little off is the atmosphere.  We were 1 of 3 parties in the place on a Friday evening and it just felt off.  The staff was friendly, no bad review in service, just the place itself kind of felt like a hotel restaurant/bar."}
{"text":"I don't want to offend any of the other reviewers but have no other way to put this. I wonder what their dining history is. I've traveled to 25 of the US states and 12 countries, had sushi in Japan. I typically am not harsh and dont think many restaurants need to be fantastic to be satisfying but I would not recommend this place and am so surprised it's still open. There is a toaster oven behind the bar where I witnessed \"sushi\" rolls being heated. Umm, it's sushi and umm, there is a toaster oven. We also ordered a fried rice bowl and it was so salty that we could not eat more than a bite and had to send it back. I have only sent something back once in my life in all of my dining experiences. Actually, if you are looking for good sushi in Charlotte, I just have to say, \"it's Charlotte, we're not near the dock with the fresh catch\"."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here. This place has the worst service (which I saw before ordering so I should have taken the hint) so I will not be back. First, my husband and I place a to-go order. We have a $25 gift certificate. No where on it does it say you have to dine-in to use it but the hostess stand (in an extremely rude manor) claims it does and tries to rush us out of the door so we have to pay $51 for food we didn't even really want, only because the gift certificate says we have to spend at least $50.   Then we get to our location and look at our food and my husband ordered hibachi. Pretty easy and a simple order but it looked and tasted disgusting. No flavoring to it and definitely not hibachi in my book.  We will not be coming back and will definitely not recommend Emzy to anyone we know."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very friendly staff.  It was an accidental find three years ago and liked the food and became regular with family.  This is my kids favourite, they love Sushi.  Food 5/5 Service 5/5 Ambiance 5/5 Location 3/5  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place out for lunch with the goal being to get some sushi.  The decor is nice and crisp/modern and I like the bar area where there is a TV.  We got there on the early side (little after 11:30am) and were promptly seated and our waitress took our drink order.  I asked her  how the Sumo Salad was prepared, as I didn't find it to be clear from the menu, and she couldn't remember.  She said something about cucumbers and a special sauce, then said \"what do you mean\"?    So I gave up on that idea and went with the Shrimp Lettuce Cups for an app and the Sashimi Salad for the main.  The filling in the lettuce cups was perfectly prepared; I'd I'd order them again.  The Sashimi salad had tons of fish and avocado in it; you don't really even need the Asian Dressing because of  how the fish is prepared.    The waitress brought our salads out while we were half way through our appetizer, which drives my husband BON KERRRRS, so he put it on another table (haha).  I must have looked really tired b/c she brought me new diet cokes when I was half way through the first AND asked me if I wanted one to go.  If I was drinking alcoholic beverages, being overserved wouldn't have bothered me.    All that being said, she was very nice, but possibly new at being a waitress.  I will definitely go back to try out the sushi and some of the other items on the menu, because they all looked right up my alley.  I'd probably give it a 4.5 for food and a 2.5 for service but rounding up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Delish! As sushi novices, my friend and I came here to try something new. We were recommended the cherry blossom roll, which was fabulous! The miso was delicious, and the service was attentive and kind. The $2 Sapporos on a Friday night just sweetened the deal for us. We finished the night with a tuxedo cheesecake which was part cheesecake, part chocolate mousse, layered onto a thick chocolate crumb crust. I don't even love chocolate! It was uh-may-zing. Definitely will come again."}
{"text":"We went back last Tuesday, the customer service was horrible; the guy that took our order should not work with people. I was ready to leave without eating because of how bad the customer service was, but he brought our order then; I was really scared the food was going to be horrendous and disgusting, but when I bit into my Philly roll, it was delicious. Thank God the food is so good, cause the customer service left too much to be desired."}
{"text":"Emzy looks completely finished.  They used to have some pretty decent sushi, and always had great deals on restaurant.com where you could get some very reasonably priced sushi. Things were pretty good as long as you could deal with their slooooow service. Never a wait because it was never full.  After eating here so many times, I wondered how long they would be able to stay open. Regardless of when I visited, the place was never more than half full. They never seemed to have more than one waiter, and in the last few months, I think the chefs have been waiting tables.  Returned this weekend to be greeted by a restaurant that feels days away from closing. The quality of their food dropped, just like their health rating. They have replaced their once good quality fish with some small, mediocre cuts. One of my rolls was mostly rice, and the sashimi was clearly of lower quality.   They seem to be cutting corners with the sushi to delay the inevitable with the never busy restaurant. The floors were dirty, and the bathroom had one working light. It was a weekend night at 7 PM and there was at most four other parties in the restaurant. I can't imagine they will be open much longer, and thanks to the downgrade in food over the last six months, I won't be back."}
{"text":"do NOT order anything to go. first of all, any sushi you order will be tiny and they put hardly any fish in it. plus during lunch service, the wait staff is terrible. it took us an hour and a half to get out of there even after telling the server we had to go back to work. DO NOT RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"The food was great! Our appetizer came out quickly and so did the main course. We had the tuna toast and then sushi (cherry blossom was my favorite). Our waitress was very helpful and polite. We come in a lot for lunch but wanted to see what it was like at night and the environment was very relaxing."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Great value for the money. Loved the scallop fried rice. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The Maguro Madness was great! Gene, our server was on point and friendly! Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Basil Flavor dish with chicken for lunch. Pretty terrible. The chicken was soggy with a clumpy sauce. Tasted like a reheated microwave meal.  Service was good. No complaints there.  I doubt I'll give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Ok, we've been here twice now after we bought 2 restaurants.com deals which required us to spend at least $50 to get $25 off.  We went by ourselves both times, so we had a pretty good selection of the menu.  My favorite item was the Hella Hot sushi roll, I think it had spicy salmon, tuna, cucumber and Siracha with a jalepeno.  It got me sweating just enough. They also have one roll that's rice free with cucumber which was nice since Gwen was trying to stay Paleo.  For dinner, I had Treasure in the Pot, which was just ok, it was a little too saucy for me, but the broccoli and peppers were fresh,so it was fine.  The fried rice I had though was really nice and balanced.  Gwen stayed paleo by just having a chicken stir-fry which was as good as something that basic can be.  Both times we've been here it's been really slow, so the service was great. I assume it's busier during lunch given it's location.  The decor is sleek and modern, and lends itself to a nice dinner out, but this place isn't too pretentious, so feel free to wear your stretch pants out on the town here..."}
{"text":"Worst rainbow roll I've ever had. Was so upset about it, I sent it back and they literally just slapped some more tuna on it to \"fix it\". Not to mention, they sat us right in the walkway to the kitchen. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place!!  Will not return."}
{"text":"Service was awful. The hostess was not friendly and lacked customer service skills. My spouse and I ordered a to-go order and unfortunately had to return to the location 3 times due to incorrect orders being given, items ordered not included in takeout bag, and food being ill prepared. I will never eat here again even though the location is within walking distance. I'd rather drive to receive better food and better service. This restaurant was one of my favorites and unfortunately has let me down repeatedly in recent times."}
{"text":"A little expensive, but the sushi is worth it. Used the restaurant.com coupon. Good environment and quick service. You can park in the garage under Duke Energy and get the parking validated."}
{"text":"What a neat little sushi bar downtown.    The Cherry Blossom roll was delicious, no complaints. First time trying a roll wrapped in soy bean sheets. The Shiro Roll wasn't very good though- the Albacore tuna was sometimes hard, crunchy and dry. The Hella Hot was pretty good, tasty, but not so hot you wanted to cry. Also tried the Fruji Moon- shot of apple sake with a blue moon. Made the beer taste just like green apple!  Fun to try, but would order something different next time.   The service was great. The ambiance was great. We went late at night, would like to try them again sometime for lunch!"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out Singaporean noodle dish for lunch today  Service: -Immediately annoyed when the first lady asked how she could help me and upon responding that I was there to pick up a take out order, she directed me to another lady at the register/checkout/pc.  This wasn't annoying, rather the fact that I had to repeat my request to the register/checkout/pc lady after she was already notified by the first employee..that rubbed me the wrong way.  - 10 minute wait turned into a 20 minute wait.  I should also note that I called in the order.  -No chairs for waiting take out guests.  Consider moving the table at the front door and adding places to sit.  Food: - Not bad, could use a lot more flavor . -Portion size is decent for lunch item  Overall, I'll give this place one more chance and will order sushi and a rice dish.  Hoping the customer service improves."}
{"text":"This is my favorite \"go-to\" sushi place in Charlotte! As another reviewer said, they constantly have a restaurant.com certificate available (which you can buy on sale occasionally for as low as $3 or $4). $2 draft beers on Friday and Saturdays make this the best sushi value in Charlotte.   I've probably had 10 or so different sushi rolls over my many visits, and I've never been disappointed. If you like sriracha/spicy ... I definitely recommend the firecracker roll! Their yum-yum sauce that is served with the hibachi meals is on-point!  Calamari and edamame are both solid appetizer choices.   You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Thought this was going to be a great sushi place... But visited this place earlier tonight and was not to busy... Took about 5 mins to be seated.. Took another 7-10 min just to get our drinks... Place was not busy... The host ended up getting our drinks..I don't know what the server was doing besides running around.... Finally placed our order.. The sushi chef was done making it... We noticed that it literally sat there for 10 mins... Don't understand why he could not bring it over once done we were sitting right next to him... Our server walked past it multiple times... Finally after the chef came back in handed us our plate and told us they were out of one item.. Don't know why our server couldn't tell us that after we placed the order ... Overall service sushi we okay not that great to rave about... If you have the time to be wasting and waiting around for food give it a try."}
{"text":"I teeter in between absolutely loving this place experiences and meh experiences. I think my experience fluctuates depending on who the chef of the day is. I do wish it was more consistent because when it's good, it is AMAZING! I've frequent Emzy at least 20 times and I've never had a \"bad\" experience per say. It's more so not as good as those \"AMAZING\" times. None the less, Emzy is still my go-to for a good Chirashi bowl and I love their rolls! I wouldn't really recommend the dinner menu otherwise, but Emzy always does satisfy a good sushi craving!"}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, very nice service, but not good sushi.   We had the spicy tuna, sexy salmon and the avocado. The salmon smelled fishy and we sent it back and asked for it uncooked - still smelled fishy.  I'm still on the hunt for a great sushi joint in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Loved Emzy. After our first trip last night it became our new favorite place to get sushi in Charlotte. The calamari is an absolute must! We also had the Duke and the MZ roll and had a hard time deciding which one was better. Also if you like sake they had a large selection and also some really good house sake for a good price. Good drink specials all week long as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I purchased a groupon for Emzy and literally called Friday, Saturday and Sunday. No one picked up, so we decided to stop by on Saturday. The place was empty. Finally on Monday (today), July 4th a cook answered. We asked to make a reservation per the groupon and he said that they were closed. We explained the situation and that we were from out of town. He provided no solution for us. To bad we leave in the morning. A groupon wasted."}
{"text":"All I can say is: WAY TOO MUCH MSG!  My lips are itchy, my head is hurting and I am thirsty as hell.  Which is my indicator for too much of the silent killer.  I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"I have to say this may be one of my favorite new sushi restaurants in Charlotte! Everything was very fresh and quickly made, the only downfall was that the waitress never returned to refill our drinks. I highly recommend this place, especially the Philly and spicy tuna roll!!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst service restaurant I ever dine-in. I usually never give a comment to yelp. I was dine-in in order sushi and tempura appetizers. The server bring me very little of tempura sauce like a joke. I ask him to get extra, and he told me no more. What? really?  no more tempura sauce, don't sell the tempura appetizers if you have not enough sauce!!!  The same server bring me the check while I'm still eating. After I order another sushi, he gave me another check wich is I didn't ask for it. I was like really?  You must be kidding me. The table still full of dirty plate and a lot of food. He don't even offer me for to go boxes until I asked for it. Guess now what? He only bring me one to go box. I still have orange chicken half plate, shrimp tempura half plate, and full brown rice. I was really disappointed with the server. Not professional at all.   After I paid my food, he don't even bring me a paper bag to wrap my food. Instead he kept playing cell phone. Really.  The worst service.  Seems they don't have enough training. Believe me if I really wanted to explain my whole detailed experience im there,  still a lot more. Like the timing bring the food are bad. But it's OK. At least now I know and no surprise this restaurant only about 3 star review."}
{"text":"Great sushi!  My husband and I love to come here while in town for business. Great quality sushi but wish the service was better. Don't come here if you are looking for grade A wait staff. But our experience with the sushi had always been spot on!"}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant because I work nearby. All I have ever ordered were shrimp fried rice or plain fried rice. I give this restaurant 3 stars because for $7-$9 I would expect my container to be full of rice. Don't skimp people when they're ordering food to go. I wish the hostesses could be a little more friendlier, but I guess that's just how they are after a lunch rush."}
{"text":"A great spot for a relaxed sushi dinner or lunch. The sushi isn't top notch but it was good and decently priced. The Hell Hot roll was by far my favorite. The calamari wasn't anything to write home about but the miso soup was good. They also have a great selection of 2$ craft beers!"}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night with my husband.  Only a few tables were filled.  Both ordered cocktails and after a long wait, we learned we had to order different drinks because of lack of ingredients.  Another wait, and it turned out they had NO ingredients for cocktails (which were the drink specials that night!) so we just ordered beers.  Waiter was very apologetic, but it took them a long time to figure out they were missing product.  Thai ceviche was ok, avocado salad was weak.  Kimchee was NOT good.  Luckily, both of our sushi rolls were excellent.  Cherry Blossom was the best.  Service was slow.  We will not return."}
{"text":"The food is always pretty good here. I got the volcano roll and the Thai ceviche which was also pretty tasty. Today they were out of alcohol but they did have wine and beer. Luckily we just came here for dinner.   The restaurant is always clean especially the bathroom. Service could be a little faster. Especially the initial contact where they bring out the waters. For some reason every time we come here, we have to wait for water and today was no different.  If you're looking for good sushi. This is the place to be. We were the only ones in the restaurant when we arrived, but by the time it was time for us to leave, two other people showed up. They are hardly ever packed so getting a seat will not be a problem."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of sushi restaurants and this one is up there with em all. The service is quick and the fish is fresh. The edamame isn't over salted. The toro was top5 I've had. The bartender was pleasant and gave great suggestions. Love it! Id come back."}
{"text":"Ordered Yakisoba w/beef which did not sat that it was spicy.  My dish was smothered in red pepper flakes and my otherwise thin lips were swollen like Angelina's.  My colleagues enjoyed their items."}
{"text":"Met my friends here prior to a PK event at the Mint Museum. Boy did I pick the right day to dine...Thursday, which is HALF OFF WINE night here. Yeay!   I ordered the Thai Chicken Curry for the table, and it was ROCK SOLID and yummy! Sweet Thai curry and very flavoful. Much better than I recently have had at other Thai restaurants.....  We ordered 3 different rolls. The waiter really sold us on one roll to be the Yellowtail roll. This was by far the weakest of the rolls. The fish was fishy and not fresh. 1 star for this. BUT the other 2 were REALLY good. Classic Rainbow Roll and one called 18 something or other, which was a deep fried shrimp with a honey glaze. VERY good!  I'm giving them a Mulligan on that awful yellowtail roll. But guys, if your fish is discolored (as this one was) PLEASE CHECK it before you serve it to your customers!  Overall a really good dining experience."}
{"text":"Had a large group for a business lunch here.  Sleek decor, attentive service, a bit loud for holding conversations, but the food was excellent. A lot of non-sushi options but I had the eel roll and the Dragon Roll, both were very good and tasted extremely fresh.  I'm somewhat picky when it comes to sushi but I thought theirs was some of the best I've had in Charlotte (not that there is a ton to compare it to).  Great location in Uptown and good food - check it out!"}
{"text":"Fresh fish in the sushi, fast service, very reasonable prices  It's also close to where I live so that's a plus"}
{"text":"what, with the trek to the elevator, across the lobby, and across two lanes of one way traffic, i almost had to pack a lunch to go to lunch.  i have been walking passed Emzy since it opened, waiting for one of my periodic lunchtime compatriots to be willing to try it.  today was that day.  i browsed the menu online prior to visiting, so i had a little bit of an idea what i was looking to get into.  i recommended to JEn that we split some things rather than just get our own entrees.  walking passed a table that had the lettuce wraps just delivered sealed the deal.  while i kind of experienced what other yelpers had with having a number of people come up as us about seating, i understood that it was simply a busy lunch and a few people where multi-tasking without aggressively executing a plan.  once we were seated, the service was great.  i am not sure if it was intentional or not, but our food came out evenly spaced so we could give our undivided attention to it.  first the chicken lettuce wraps.  with a sweet and sour type of flavor to it and some chopped peppers in there, they had a very good taste and there was ample chicken to self wrap for each of us.  next was the sesame tuna tartare.  initially, we didn't have a spoon to divvy it up, so we were caught just sort of staring at it until a server got us what we needed.  great texture, fantastic flavor.  the spice was a little heated, but it was welcome.  JEn needed another water.  we rounded it out with the rainbow roll.  had some avacado, cucumber, crab, tuna, yellowtail, and salmon in there.  the presentation was good, but there wasn't a whole lot of kick to any of it.  not bad, but nothing that wowwed like our first two \"courses.\"  a split check settled us out at around fifteen clams a piece which made it an overall rewarding dining experience.  i would go 3.5 stars, but am opting for the 3 instead of 4."}
{"text":"I must be blessed here because my husband and I have been here multiple times and have never had bad service or food. We usually opt for the sushi. The hella hot is my favorite by far and we've tried a lot of rolls here. We also love the calamari. It's not the best quality of calamari, but the sauce it comes with compliments the dish well.   Another winner here is the chicken hibachi that comes with a coconut sauce. It's so good! We order it almost every time. In addition they have $2 beers on Friday and Saturday. Saaaay what?! Can't beat that in Charlotte.   Another bonus? They ALWAYS have groupons and restaurant.com coupons so we never pay full price. That's the main reason we keep coming back here."}
{"text":"The kimchi fried rice was divine. I had to fight my friends off for it.  It has a nice, light burn, very pleasant.  Perfect for my cold.  We got take out and even though the restaurant was full, our order came out in under 10 minutes.  The staff was courteous and professional.  We felt welcomed.   I will make this a regular lunch destination from now on.  Will update the review after we try more dishes."}
{"text":"I've just moved to Charlotte from Boston via Seattle and in the past year of visiting checking on the home I am building I've visited this restaurant 8-10 times. The staff is always friendly and accommodating even if a bit slow at times but we are never in a rush so take that for what it's worth.  Now into the food review. The sushi is the best I've had in Charlotte. Same owners as Room 112 which is comparable. Other reviews slam the sushi or to go food... Don't order sushi to go idiot. It's not a pizza. Having enjoyed some of the best sushi in Boston, New York and Seattle I can say it's never good to go anywhere.   The bartenders always comp a drink or two for us which is unnecessary but appreciated. Consistently going out and spending 80-120 each time we go here, I always leave happy and having had good fish. And to those who complain about the fish, try asking your sushi chef what is fresh!?! Sorry most of me just thinks the bad reviews are a direct result of diners not understanding how to order what they want. How about a little culpability folks!? :)"}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch on a Friday with some cowokers. Overall, great experience and I would come back!  The place was PACKED when we got there and had to wait about 15-20 min to be seated with a group of 5. It's always a good sign when a place is busy, so waiting was fine with us.   The day we went, the drunk special was $2 draft beers which a few of us definitely took advantage of. We ordered our food right away, and got it pretty quickly even though the place was busy. The food was all delicious, everyone licked their plates clean.   Come check out Emzy!!"}
{"text":"If you don't eat sushi- don't eat here. I ordered orange chicken with brown rice. What I got looked like a piece of Tyson fried chicken patty with a tiny side dish of duck sauce. The rice was dry and none of my food was hot. This was my second time here and both visits were disappointing. Service was also awful as well and my friend's orders were both screwed up. I want to like this place and would go often if I did given its proximity to my office, however I will walk down the street and eat elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Groupon, $18 for $30 worth and we'll probably try and buy another one because we enjoyed our dinner. It did have a slight dying restaurant feel being sparse with customers on a Saturday night, but i still felt the ambiance was good. The bar looks nice and inviting. We ordered a few veggie sushi rolls to start with no complaints there. Service was on point, although we only saw one waitress, she never kept us waiting. On a Saturday night, they were offering $2 Sam Adams Oktoberfest drafts. It's not the Mektoberfest i was craving, but it's a great weekend price on a satisfying beer. We also ordered the udon noodles with tofu and the tofu spicy curry. I'd be happy with either one again, but i'd choose the curry first.  Hope all the new apartments breathe some life into this place and bring them some good business."}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled on Emzy looking for a place to eat nearby before heading to the Knight Theatre  on a rainy cold May night.  The sushi we had was very good, and of the dishes we ate, the Singaporean noodles with chicken was the best; it was outstanding  and perhaps the best Asian dishes I've ever had in Charlotte. All the menu items were reasonably priced. I will definitely dine at Emzy again (and if I lived or worked nearby, I'd be there at least once a week- especially for the Singaporean noodles)."}
{"text":"Tried to go here for a large lunch today, there was a Groupon available, and didn't specify any restrictions. However just to be sure, we called ahead, prior to purchasing the Groupon, and asked repeatedly if the Groupon could be used for lunch. The person who answered the phone said yes, then put the phone down to double check with a manager or co-worker, came back and said yes again. We asked again, are you sure it can be used for lunch, for anything on the menu? Again, the answer was yes. We walked to the restaurant and were seated by a very pleasant waitress and when she asked if it would be all on one check we said yes and we have a Groupon. She said ok let me make sure that can be used for lunch...already were worried. The manager comes over and rudely just states, \"Groupon can only be used for dinner\" and walks away. We protest to the waitress and explain that we called ahead to make sure, she apologizes nicely and gets the manager back. We explain that we called ahead, and he again rudely states, \"It's only for dinner\". We ask if he can honor it or match the expected discount (and then mark the Groupon as used or void it somehow, we didn't want to double dip on the discount or anything) due to the obvious misinformation we were provided when we called. He says no. We again explain that we didn't appreciate the terrible experience thus far and would hope he would somehow honor our expectations. He again says no, Groupon is only for dinner, he (THE MANAGER) can't do anything about it. We give it one last shot and say we are going to get up and leave if he doesn't honor it and continues the dismissive attitude. He shrugged his shoulders and says he can't do it. No apology, and he let us walk out.  So, basically we will not be going back, ever; which is too bad because we live across the street and hadn't been before. It seemed nice."}
{"text":"Emzy is always my go to for lunch Asian cuisine downtown. The food always taste fresh and they give you great portions. I am stuck on the spicy stir fry with chicken which is not spicy at all and I cannot eat spicy food. The crispy spring rolls are great as well ! Love the atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"There's not a lot going on Friday night in Charlotte. But we had great sushi. Tons of variety. Love the dynamite roll! Calamari was tasty, topped with onions & peppers which added another layer of flavor. Also had the Katsu sandwich which was such a delight. And who doesn't love udon noodles. This whole experience was just yum! And to top it off the staff was so attentive. Manager checked in with us. Waiter, Green, was so nice and helpful. Took time to explain the menu and make suggestions."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here with a $25 restaurant.com gift card where we had to spend $50 and we did that without even trying. The sushi was okay but nothing I'd rave about. I actually left here saying \"I think I'm done with sushi for a while\" (this was about a month ago) and I haven't been out for sushi since.   The most disappointing part for me is that we had to complain about the uneven and very small sashimi portion we received which we were paying $10-12 for. I can't justify dining in a business that is not consistent. This error was corrected but not really because the portion was still very small. We have had better sushi for quality, pricing and portions elsewhere."}
{"text":"haven't been here in a while- always had awful and slow service. Thought I would give it a try for lunch again & now I know why i don't come here- again, I am disappointed. The sesame chicken is a fried chicken breast cut up in slices for which you pour your own sauce over. What kind of sesame chicken is that? Fried rice had a weird funk to it too. Sad I spent calories eating that food."}
{"text":"This place has the most delicious and fresh sushi in Charlotte! We come here every month or so, so many amazing choices and very friendly stuff!"}
{"text":"After moving to Charlotte from an area with more diverse cuisine, I had trouble finding a good sushi spot. I thought I had found a good \"cheap but good\" sushi restaurant, and came here a few times over the course of 6 months or so with my girlfriend. We were happy enough the first few times. We decided after our first few visits to only go for the sashimi combos, as the rolls had left us disappointed. Our last few visits didn't meet the same quality we'd remembered from the past, and led to us completely swearing Emzy off, even though we still have a few coupons paid for via Restaurant.com that will end up not being used.   Big issues with the sashimi combos they have:  1) They frequently fill it in with walu(ie: escolar), which has some really common unpleasant side effects after eating it.   2) On our last visit, some of the fish in our order was very stringy and tasted off. While my girlfriend and I had both ordered the same sashimi combo, her cuts of a few of the pieces of fish seemed worse than mine. I tried a piece of hers and gagged, spit it out, and nearly threw up.   The general vibe I get here is that there's more focus on the bar aspect and happy hour. I suppose their sushi/sashimi ends up being the sushi equivalent of bar food, then? After having enough drinks, the quality doesn't matter as much. Having found better places in the Charlotte area, we won't be returning here."}
{"text":"Great food with fresh flavor.  Really a hidden jem.  Service is always great.  Can't recommend enough.  Lived in uptown and have my favorites that stand out and this is one"}
{"text":"Nice location and nice and roomy tables.  It was quiet, and the service was solid.  Nothing over the top but more than satisfactory.    The sushi was pretty good, however, not exactly the best we've ever had.  One sushi roll we tried is topped w/ a piece of fried shrimp - - sounded appetizing and we were excited to try it, but most of us felt the shrimp was so big and it overpowered the sushi itself.  Now I'm not suggesting to get mini shrimp and reduce the portions, I mean we like fried shrimp, but it was somewhat of an odd combination.  At least they get kudos for trying something new.   The calamari we got was not crispy as we expected but it tasted pretty good.  One person in our group wasn't too crazy about the soy wrapping around one of the sushi rolls, I've had it before so I thought it was fine and liked it.  They pump out some good sized rolls here which is nice, but overall I felt it didn't have that \"umami\" factor - - something that sets them apart from the rest.  It was more on the bland side than what I'm used to, and none of the sushi rice was warm or had that slight hint of rice wine vinegar which is what I'm used to when my Tokyo Mother makes the Real McCoy.    Service was solid, drinks filled promptly, and we used a restaurant.com coupon which made it a more reasonable affair.  With all the sushi places in town I'll probably give others a try first before coming back here again, and overall I'd say \"A-OK\" is an accurate account of our experience here.  But don't take it from us - - try it yourself since no one sushi palate is the same."}
{"text":"I took my husband here for his birthday, but was extremely hesitant because of the mixed reviews that I read on here.  I am so glad that we went anyway.  The atmosphere was really nice and we had a really good time sitting at the bar having drinks and sushi.  We ended up ordering the spicy salmon, hella hot, and sexy salmon and all three were delicious!  I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The spicy curry use to be my favorite but it seems that the quality over multiple visits has been dropping off.  I took my kids and the loved the lettuce wraps.  Ordered them recently and when they brought \"them\" out, they informed us that they ran out of lettuce."}
{"text":"Tried this place because of a groupon. Ordered the dim sum platter and the spicy tuna ball for apps and a variety of sushi rolls. The sushi was good, spicy tuna ball was my favorite. It came with 6 pieces which was much bigger than I thought it would be so it was a pleasant surprise. The rest of the sushi was good, the service and ambience wasn't so much. Our server was very nice, but not too knowledgeable. We asked if they had drink specials and the response we received was \"we only have beer and wine tonight\". I ordered the Kirin and she had no idea what I was talking about. Also tried the sake flight, but the names on the board did not match and were out of order so I had no idea what I was drinking. It looks like they are in the middle of changing some things so hopefully it's for the better- and the martinis make their way back!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I purchased a Groupon for Emzy and decided to give it a go this past Tuesday night. We were excited to try another sushi place in Charlotte and unfortunately ended up underwhelmed overall.   For starters, our waiter was terrible. As someone who works and has worked in retail for years, I always give people the benefit of the doubt and am super easy to please when it comes to restaurants and stores. I also normally don't care about service at restaurants but this was a particularly terrible experience. Our waiter came to our table after we were seated and instead of saying \"hello\" or \"how are you\" literally started with \"what do you want?\" My fiancé and I were taken aback and immediately asked for some time to sort out our order. Our waiter proceeded to roll his eyes and walked away. The rest of the meal included minimal interaction with him. I felt like a nuisance the entire time I was there (instead of a paying patron).   As for the food, we ordered sushi to share. Overall it was good quality though a bit overpriced. The tuna tartare included very little tuna (mainly rice which is odd) and tasted almost like salsa with its abundance of cilantro. The rolls were good but small. I've had better, bigger rolls of sushi elsewhere for much cheaper and without crappy wait staff. Also, while chewing one of the rolls, I spit out a piece of plastic. I didn't complain so as not to upset our waiter further but I was not pleased.   We will most definitely not be back."}
{"text":"this place is awful. service is bad - do yourself a favor and go to 112! better food, prices & service.  and no i do not work for 112 - i was just so displeased with my experience here!"}
{"text":"Some restaurants in Charlotte get business, especially during lunch, because it seems like there's nothing else to eat and a new place deserves our patronage. Why two stars? \"Meh. I've experienced better\" about sums it up.  The restaurant wants to price at the $8-10 per lunch plate, but the portions usually require you to step the individual bill to $12-$15 range, requiring an ordering of an appetizer or salad. Unfortunately all the dishes appear to be pre-made items bought from the grocery store that I could make at home.  Of the party of 4, the meat in the dishes were scarce and not particularly clean or good cuts. Your assorted chopped, sliced, pan-Asian stir fry meat. The udon noodles appear to be those you can buy at the local Asian grocery store in packages, cut open, douse with sauce, stir fry and serve. Nothing special or homemade. Same can be said for the vegetables. Thanks for heating up what appears to be vegetable from a bag in the frozen food aisle of the grocery store and charging people 403958340953x the price on it.  Pursuit of margins while not providing actually good food is a very fast way to close a restaurant. This place reminds me of Rice Inc. another pan-Asian joint in uptown Charlotte that failed in less than one year. Rice Inc suffered the same problems I think Emzy will likely suffer. The pricing for quality of the food is a robbery."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at EMZY is inviting and the service is fantastic. If you come around 5-6, you may find a good crowd as most patrons are coming in after work. Fridays, drafts are $2 (Blue Moon, Chimay, and Copper OMB.)"}
{"text":"Feels like a new place with the awkward paper table coverings. But...solid sushi, cold beer, and fast service. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"First, I would not give a small business one star lightly. But \"Methinks not\" sums up how I feel.  The Pros: the atmosphere was great, the drafts were $2, the service was pretty good, the location is nice, they are on restaurant.com (like a Groupon).  The Cons: the food (and maybe the prices, but only because of the quality of the food).  We had water, a couple of Kirins (beer), miso soup, edamame, tempura shrimp and vegetables, a Salmon Dream roll, and an MZ roll (with no cucumber). The beer was the only thing that satisfied me ($2 pints, out of a keg, tasted like beer). My water tasted funny, like there was a hint of tea in it or something; not awful, but weird and not a good start. The miso was super fishy, wayyy too salty, and the seaweed was tough. I had that fishy taste in my mouth long after we left. The edamame was overcooked and under-salted (how do you mess up edamame?). The tempura shrimp/veggie plate was pretty good, I liked the sauce and the shrimp, but I've had better tempura vegetables. The Salmon Dream roll was good, no complaints there. The MZ roll came out with cream cheese in it - it does not come with cream cheese (and I hate cream cheese in sushi rolls, the whole idea is gross). I tried to eat it, but had to send that back, and the waiter told us that he was sorry and that they had a new sushi chef. We got a new one, it came out with cucumber in it (which we had requested there be none of because my girlfriend doesn't like it), but we ate it, it was good to me (and it would be to most people), easy mistake to make.  I've seen some others complain about prices here. I disagree with that. The prices actually were pretty good to be eating at a modern, trendy place in uptown. It's the fact that the quality of their food does not stand up to the prices that is the problem. If I had gone to a budget sushi conveyor-belt place in a college town, I would expect this kind of food.  The key: all of these things were pretty minor taken by themselves, but taken together, it doesn't make for good dining. You want attention to detail at a sushi place. Not just any raw salmon or tuna will cut it - the chef has to be specially trained and must meticulously observe the meat. To be clear, I did not get sick; but I was worried that would be given the lack of attention to detail with so many other things.  This place seems new. I'm hoping the management will get this place into shape. If they don't change things, they're not going to last.  Again, I am not trying to be mean by giving this small business this rating, but if their kitchen was in order they would have a much higher rating."}
{"text":"So happy that I DID NOT listen to the reviews on yelp. I've been using yelp since it started....and have had used yelp as my guide. So i was trepidatious going here....but something in my gut told me to go to emzy anyway. SO HAPPY I did!!! Sushi was fantastic...service was fantastic ...location fantastic....easy parking in the duke energy building....clean, clean, clean...generous drink specials everyday of the week! What is not to love? I've eaten sushi around the world, and I have a \"snobby\" palate and i thought this place rocks!  I started talking to the sushi chef on my last visit...I've been there 2x now...he used to work at Nobu!!! He has a special spicy sauce that he makes from scratch that is not on the menu and guess what?..... it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday. The wait staff was very slow but efficient when they were around, it seemed they were pretty understaffed. I ordered hibachi chicken which was pretty tasty, the chicken tasted fresh and had a good texture. My friend ordered sushi and he liked it a lot. A solid lunch option if you're not pressed for time."}
{"text":"I've been before and liked it a lot, but I went for lunch with a group and it was nothing if not subpar. The prices seem to have gone up and my $20+ a la carte lunch was some sad shreds of tuna, salmon, and white tuna. The white tuna sashimi was the only one that tasted 100% fresh and was cut well. The others... well... I didn't get sick off the lukewarm salmon nigiri and the tuna nigiri's shredded texture didn't weird me out too much.   The timing of the meals was also off and almost everyone in my party received their food well before I did. They were almost finished eating by the time mine arrived. However, it did give me a chance to sample off other people's plates and I can still vouch for the curries, hibachi, and edamame. The hot food seemed great and though I didn't try it, I had a friend who was pleased with her maki roll as well."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday night with some coworkers and it was unfortunately a disappointing experience. The house salad was strewn with pieces of wilted, rotten lettuce that rendered the dish inedible. The sushi roll I ordered came with even more rotten lettuce piled on top of it and made me lose my appetite for the sushi beneath. The \"fresh rolls\" smelled a bit odd and tasted old. I was still hungry after ordering these three dishes and not being able to eat them so I ordered some fried rice, which tasted fine. The two stars are for the wait staff, who were friendly and seemed to be working hard."}
{"text":"Food is not bad at all, but that's where the good things end.  First off, the color. This is might well be my personal opinion but I have no idea why the world would Emzy choose to have the seats and wall in light blue. It feels aloof and tasteless. Also the decoration is plain and boring for the the prices it's charging. No, it is not \"simple\" it is just plain. So if you want to have a date, this place won't be ideal.   Second, a waitress who caught my nerve. Hey I know, this is Charlotte and by no means the most diverse city ever. Nonetheless I was still shocked by how we were treated differently compared to some other guests. I am not necessarily saying that this person is racist or prejudiced but I am surely offended by her lack of professionalism.   Overall, have to say I am very disappointed at Emzy, and will not be visiting again. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Second visit & very disappointed. We remember it being much better so that we were enthusiastic about coming back. The salad greens were not quite fresh. I ordered a sale flight and the waiter said he couldn't pronounce a couple but described the flavor. They were served on a tray identifying them but turns out none of the sake on the tray matched the names on the tray. ???  The calamari though flavorful, had mushy texture batter & the sauce was basically the duck sauce from the plastic packets. And then the sushi came. I ordered the Sashimi Plate. I got 15 of the 18 pieces initially. When corrected they brought 3 more yellow tail instead of another variety. I was so, so disappointed in the lack of freshness and flavor. Even my son's rolls had a day old taste. Totally unacceptable with sushi. The servers raced around so it was hard to get their attention. They seemed a bit immature or maybe untrained. Now where am I going to go for sushi in Charlotte?"}
{"text":"Popped in here last night for dinner and it was great!  It is located in the breezeway between the Duke Energy Building and the Mint Museum.  You can park on the street or one of the many parking garages near by.  The atmosphere is a little on the trendy side.  You can sit at the bar and watch your sushi made in front of you or get one of the many booths and tables.  It isnt a huge restaurant and I didnt need reservations for dinner last night.  I think it is probably more packed when there are events at the Knight Theatre etc.  We had the calamari app - very spicy and not too heavily breaded.  Crispy and delicious.  I ordered the Yum Yum roll and a simple spicy tuna roll - both were very cold and delicious!  My friend ordered the Cherry Blossom roll which was a bit over the top but good :-)  They have my FAV wine - Conundrum....which is hard to find at area restaurants.  Heavy pours and very friendly bar staff.  Everyone was super nice and I would definitely go again (even tho it was a bit pricey.)  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"The many times I have been to Emzy it has mostly been for lunch.  They fill up quick during the lunch hour so many times there is a wait particularly if you need to seat more than 4.  The food is generally pretty tasty, including the various sushi and rolls.  I like the Thai ceviche, always fresh and citrusy.  The service is usually good (though not stellar) but it is busy so you can't expect a lot of attention.  Overall a good place to go but a little pricey for my taste."}
{"text":"Over the past two years, Charlotte has received a steady inflow of Asian cuisine. Many of these restaurants have been able to achieve mild success this far South, while others have fallen flat in their attempt to cater to a taste they don't quite understand. Emzy falls somewhere in the middle... it brings a little bit extra to the table, but nothing really stands out on its own.  I praise the diversity that Emzy offers in its menu, featuring sushi, ramen bowls, stir fries and sandwiches. All these dishes however, are quite average and there's some evidence that shortcuts are taken in pushing food out to the customers. I tasted something not quite fresh in my ramen and I can't tell if it was the broccoli or the shrimp that came out of a bag. The broth on this \"Spicy Shrimp Ramen\" was quite good and one of the best I've had in uptown - this is probably the best dish they have to offer. It's a large bowl and great value with lots of different ingredients floating around in the mix. The gyoza was also quite nice - filled with specks of ginger and scallions and seasoned well.  The kimchi fried rice was awesome to see listed, but sadly it tasted better in theory than on my palate. I'm not sure if it's my frequent trips to K-Town in NYC that have refined my taste for this delicacy, but I couldn't quite taste the robust and flavorful tang that I normally would with fresh kimchi - the rice was also somehwat sub par.   Service took way too long; while I can appreciate a busy kitchen, there were only 4 tables filled in the dining room. At least it let me admire the interior design of the restaurant which is laid out pretty well. Nice interiors and a full-service bar.   They have a take out option, which is convenient and fairly priced, though Emzy is never my first thought when it comes to eating Asian food in Charlotte.   I would come here again, maybe to try the Katsu Sandwich, but otherwise, you don't have to trek all the way out here for a decent bite!  3/5"}
{"text":"So this is the second time I've come to this restaurant via a Groupon deal and it'll be my last. The food I had posted a year or so back was ok and I guess I was hoping things had changed since their still in business. However I was sadly incorrect and it seemed to have gotten worse.   Though I only paid $13 for my groupon, they weren't aware that I had a deal until the end of my visit. The host was NOT smiling, not friendly, not welcoming at all. She looked like she had enough for the day and was ready to go. The server did not assist or make suggestions about their menu she just said let me know where you're ready. Once I selected my apatosaurus the ceviche, I then later ordered two rolls so that I could could reach the $30 amount. When u was time to pay the server said that I needed to order something additional because my total has to be $30 before tax. Though I did not want anything else because nothing was worth ordering additional. I just ordered soup. She then comes back and says I'm still short $.60! I said EXCUSE ME! $.60 so I have to buy something else? At this point i was becoming annoyed  and told her to just add a soda or something to my meal. What was the point of the groupon is I was going to pay for everything regular price.   As I finished up and left the resultant I noticed their food ratings was a 94.0 something I did not see when coming in.  As clean, cut and dry that I'm sharing this to you was exactly what I received."}
{"text":"This place is so so...    Don't set your Expectations high when it comes to this place.  Remember you are buying sushi in Charlotte, NC...   NASCAR Country or as i like to call it ASS-CAR land...   Wait Staff:   They are okay.  Sometimes they are good and other times they are completely incompetent.   Lunch & Dinner (Non-Sushi)  -  The food is rather bland in taste.  I had the Udon with Beef and Chicken and it was obvious neither was seasoned or marinated.   Sushi - instead of giving soy sauce, they gave me either Oyster or Eel sauce.. I mean really ???  WTF??    Their rolls are poorly made and contain very little fish.  My Colleague had a roll that didn't have any fish at all.   My colleagues made a large order that they screwed up twice.... and yet we still continue to punish ourselves by going back.  The only other options are mellow mushroom or some burger joint...   Summary:  If you are from any major city (LA, San Fran, Chicago, Miami, Washington DC, Houston, NYC), then set your expectations very low or just don't even bother.   But if you are from a \"fly over state\"  or a small city and you haven't had much experience to Sushi or asian foods... then you may like this place."}
{"text":"So being so close to my place it was another night of grabbing a drink and a bite to eat.  They have drink specials throughout the week (good to know) and their food is affordable.  Try the Sushi sqaures on the app side of the menu....very tasty!!"}
{"text":"I went there for my first time last week for lunch. It was busy but our food still came out quickly. Service was very good.  I got the shrimp clay pot.  It was decent but a little sweet for my taste. I will definitely check it out again and try something new."}
{"text":"Good food! We enjoy the Shrimp Fried Rice and Firecracker Tempura Roll. Prices are reasonable. Serving sizes are decent. The space seems a bit outdated and could use a refresh. Overall, a great option for calling in an order when we work late and need a quick fresh dinner option."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar- Friday is $2 dollar select draft beers. Bought a Groupon and plus there's yelp cash back- double bonus!  Sushi was really good and decently priced. Started with the shrimp lettuce cups & then had the rainbow roll and cherry blossom with no sauce on top. Husband had the beef hibachi. Hibachi was good - heavy on the onions but great flavor! For the price it was good, and service was good!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar watching the NBA playoffs. This place has a beautiful atmosphere! The food was GREAT. The sushi chef did a great job. Everything tastes fresh! The Kim Chi was amazing."}
{"text":"When we first saw Emzy on Restaurant.com we had to give it a try because we are absolute sushi lovers, and it was quite good!  Really quite good sushi...at first.  We went about a month ago and things had gone rapidly downhill.  The health rating alone told us we would not be returning, it went down every time we visited which is never a good sign really.  The restaurant is never busy, even on Friday and Saturday evenings despite its prime-ish location.  The bar actually looks really cool and the restaurant had a lot of potential.  However, it seems like that particular street struggles in keeping restaurants open.  The hostess seems to play waitress too and bartenders play sushi chef or the other way around.  The sushi got smaller and smaller each time which is unfortunate.  I fear for their future, but if you put zero effort in turning things around (the bathroom door didn't even lock, change the table clothes between diners, have matching drinking glasses instead of random ones) then what do you expect?"}
{"text":"This place was exactly what I was looking for. The service was fantastic... Brittney was very attentive and pleasant to talk to. The sushi selection met expectations and the taste easily surpassed expectations. The presentation was beautiful, and the fish was fresh. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I think three stars is perfect for this place. The food is ok and the atmosphere is ok. They didn't have half the beers or wines on their menu in stock when we went so we settled for what they did have which was ok. If you are starving they are always empty in the evenings."}
{"text":"A lot of sushi for the price. Ordered a spicy tuna hand roll and it was double the normal quantity. Salad was good. The portion was huge though. Too big for one person. More like a dinner salad than an side salad. Tempura appetizer was enough for 3 people. They have drink specials nightly. Tonight was $2 draft beers. Decent selection."}
{"text":"My husband and I went last night before the Charlotte Symphony concert. I also had a Groupon to use. We absolutely loved it. The service was great and the food was delish. Not to mention, the portion sizes were massive. They also had great drink specials, even on a Friday night. I loved the different options for sushi as well. I felt like they had a different selection than most other sushi places around here. It always seems like you see the same type of roll with a different name.  My husband got the hella hot and it definitely lived up to its name.   I would highly recommend this place again and plan to go back."}
{"text":"I feel like I should give 5 stars but I rarely do that... We sat at the bar and Collin was an excellent host.  Attentive, friendly and checked in without being intrusive.  Tempura Cheese... light, cheesy, delicious.  We didn't feel like we already had a meal when done. Creamy Rice with Shrimp...Yum, yum, yum.  Perfectly cooked.  Shrimp sauce is a little sweet but I like that.  Singaporean Noodles with Chicken... Yum, yum, yum and not spicy so I enjoyed that.  I'm sure you can bump up the spice.    All tasty and portions are plenty to share.  Very happy to have found this restaurant.  Music is upbeat, trendy and new... Love it.  Can't wait to get this for take-out too."}
{"text":"They have a nice/trendy set-up.  Service seems to have declined over last few years. The food is decent,  I've had better in the uptown area. The customer service is what will keep me away from this spot."}
{"text":"What a great experience located in the South end of uptown. With any new experience, I will ask what is either most popular or recommended. I ended up with a waiter that probably knew about as much as me just by looking at the menu. I didn't ask how long he had worked there. I ended up with the treasure pot. Excellent choice. Portion size is on the money for lunch. The sushi is pretty good if you absolutely must have sushi for lunch. I had the 13 year old with me. If it passed her approval then I know we were in a good spot. Pros are good selection from a wide range of Asian fair. Cons are ensuring you time the place right as it gets crowded for lunch, ensuring you land a good waiter/waitress and asking for a little bit of a higher health score. I prefer sushi served in restaurants that are 99-100+.   FYI, like E2, this restaurant is on the more expensive side for lunch. The atmosphere is hip contemporary. Know what you're expecting here for lunch. Unless you happen to be within walking distance to some of our best Charlotte sushi/Asian joints (not in Uptown I promise), then go knowing it's the best place close by."}
{"text":"I am in the middle of a love affair with Emzy. The Joyful Dim Sum Platter is some of the best shrimp dumplings I have had, and they always bring it piping hot straight from the kitchen. The Maguro Madness roll comes with plenty of tuna and an interesting spicy imitation crab mix in the middle. It is delicious. Also on Friday and Saturday nights their draft beers (except Chimay) are only $2. That's the best weekend deal for Blue Moon or your favorite seasonal that I have found.   The best part about Emzy is their constant availability on Resturant.com, and when you wait for the deals you can pay $3 for a voucher that is $25 off a bill of $50 or more. Combine this deal with weekend beer specials and we can get a nice dinner out in the city, with several drinks for about $40 after tax, tip and voucher cost.   The one downfall of Emzy is the service. We have never seen it busy, and yet on more than one occasion we have been rushed through the meal even though the restaurant isn't even a quarter full. Last time this happened the waitress kept bringing the check even though we were in the middle of the meal, and wanted more drinks. I say \"kept bringing\" because I can be a bit brazen and we wanted to get to the $50 mark to use our certificate, so I ordered more beer after she brought two checks. You would think after the first time, and literally no other tables in her section, she would ask if we wanted another round?"}
{"text":"Couldn't believe how fresh the nigiri was! Gene was a great server, he gave us recommendations and was very accommodating, will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Good for when you just have a craving for sushi, but definitely not the best place in Charlotte. I got the Groupon, so I would go back if I had another one, but not if I had to pay full price. All of the sushi we had was good, but it was most filler like cream cheese instead of fish. We started with the fresh rolls, and I have to say they were not very fresh and there was only one shrimp in each one. Our favorite roll was the Hella Hot roll and they do have some of their wine bottles half-off on Thursdays. Our server was great and it is a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"First visit to Emzy last weekend and my wife and I loved the sushi! It was a little weird when we arrived around 7:45 on a Saturday night and the place was dead. I was worried the food might not be good, but I have to say that everything was great! We both eat sushi all the time and we had some of the best sushi here at Emzy. I am not sure why the place was packed out with patrons. The atmosphere is trendy and cool, the wait staff was friendly and the food great. I have to assume that the location, not near Trade and Tryon or the Epicenter, are the only reason it was mostly empty. Well, that is a shame. If you like sushi, this place is not to be missed. We loved the Drunken Shrimp Roll, and especially loved the Sweet 18 Roll! It's a bit pricey at $16, but the Sweet 18 was worth every penny! The Spicy Tuna Ball small plate was excellent as well. If you're a fan of sushi, I would recommend Emzy for sure!"}
{"text":"Haven't had a good experience here in two visits.  The food is about as bland as it gets and the second time I ordered take out, got to my apartment took two bites and fed it to my garbage disposal.  How this place stays in business is beyond me."}
{"text":"Thought this was a high quality sushi restaurant. Had the thai Ceviche appetizer (shrimps/scallops/calamari mixed with chopped onions/bell peppers/cilantro) and loved it.  I also had the Firecracker Roll (shoft shell crab/spicy yellowtail/smolked salmon/masago) and loved it. Would definitely come back next time in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Food was good so I called BEFORE purchasing the restaurant.com gift card to make sure I could use it for take out the next time since I didn't see any restrictions on the main certificate page. The person that answered the phone said, yup no problem.\" I went ahead to purchase from restaurant.com and called the next day to place a to-go order. I was told they do not honor \"to-go\" orders with restaurant.com gift certificates EVEN THOUGH I CALLED BEFORE PURCHASING TO VERIFY. I will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I were on spring break in Charlotte when we stumbled upon Emzy. Needless to say, we enjoyed it so much we ate there three times!  As much as I love Chinese/Japanese/Asian food, most of it tends to make me feel very full and gross after I eat it. That didn't happen at Emzy. I had the spicy shrimp stir fry twice and one of their sushi rolls, and both times I was able to finish my meal and not feel overly stuffed.  The spicy shrimp stir fry was absolutely amazing. I really liked the mix of veggies and the brown sauce they use is divine. They had a lot of options on the menu; I wish we would have had more time to spend in Charlotte so we could try more things! The only aspect of Emzy I was a little disappointed in was the service. I felt like our food could have been served quicker. One of the people we were with asked to have his sushi made for take out, but he got his food last.  Overall, I really enjoyed eating at Emzy. I'm not super familiar with the city of Charlotte, but from what I could tell the restaurant was in a great location and was popular with the business folk who worked in the nearby Duke Energy Center. I definitely wish we had an Emzy back in my hometown!"}
{"text":"When my hubby and I started to plan our trip to Charlotte I looked at options on Restaurant.com and Emzy was one of them.  I was a bit leery of their 3 star rating on here but decided to give it a go, and I am sure glad we did!  We went on a Friday evening and it was a bit empty.  There were a few people at the bar but there were only a couple tables seated.  For a starter, we ordered the Joyful Dim Sum Platter.  It consisted of 3 different dumplings and they were all equally delicious.  As an entree I decided on the Yakisoba shrimp noodle bowl.  It was full of flavor and there were plenty of shrimp and veggies.  Hubby chose 3 sushi rolls and we finished the entire plate.  Because we were just shy of the minimum dollar requirement for our gift certificate we decided to try their key lime pie.  The crust was a bit soggy but it was still really tasty.  I am so glad we came here for dinner.  The server was very friendly and even suggested we go to the park's opening right around the corner.  If he didn't mention that I don't know what we would have found to do."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now and I absolutely love it. There are always groupons or deals for Emzy too! The sushi is fresh, the service is fast (we usually go closer to the opening of emzy for dinner) and the cocktails are amazing. Depending upon what you order, the $18 for $30 deal will just about cover your meal for two people."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this spot after my husband found a coupon for it through his work. We went during a Panthers pre-season game and it was pretty dead inside. Our waiter was phenomenal and walked us though the menu to see if we had any questions and then let us decide. There was no sense of rush or pressure, which I really enjoyed. We started with the edamame and gyoza and both were light and delicious. Then the sushi came and it looked too beautiful to eat. We got three rolls total and there was more than enough food. All the fish tasted fresh and the seasoning was on point. I would definitely order all my rolls again. I have no idea about the parking situation, but if you're uptown, i recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Sushi is great here, very fresh.  If you love spicy make sure to get the Hella Hot roll!  They appetizers are good as well, especially the lettuce cups.  Best Sushi in up town Charlotte, great for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"????????????? ???????????????????? ????????????????????? ???????????????????? ????????????????? ?????????"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!!!! Go to Red Ginger instead!! Horrible customer experience!!! Drove to eat and they were closed when they were suppose to be open! 2nd time they wouldn't let a 2 separate parties use different groupons because they knew each other!!! STAY AWAY!! Go to Red Ginger down the road!! Horrible! The owner John doesn't care about the customers. Said he didn't really care if we came back or not when asking about Groupons!!! Hope they go out of business"}
{"text":"My favorite Asian food in uptown. This place never disappointed me. My favorite being kimchi fried rice, stirfty with today chicken. All sushis items"}
{"text":"The sushi was pretty good quality, but did not wow me.  The service was a little slow.  Prices were reasonable.   There are plenty of big tables for larger parties.   As far as parking, there is a parking garage connected to it, where you can get parking free for up to two hours- so be sure to mention it!   The parking garage takes you right up to the main floor."}
{"text":"Great sushi and lunchtime prices! It was busy at lunchtime but we were seated quickly. Service was good but not out of this world. Loved the roll I had with roe eggs, Tuna, cream cheese and fried rice. The ginger salad was typical of an Asian restaurant but the dressing was thicker and much better than I usually have out. Would definitely try again for lunch!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi and food.... why am I always craving this place!! LOL love the service and ambiance! Sweet 18 is my go to and Yakisoba!"}
{"text":"What to say about emzy.... well to start they gave me the game changer of freshwater eel that wasn't tough but still cooked. That being said I ordered the eel this time but they were out of eel. I was a bit butt hurt about that, but I asked the sushi chef what he recommends and when he told us that he had yellowtail tuna, cut from the belly, I had to do it!!! I have to say that is by far the best fish I and my girlfriend have ever had! Just to give perspective I've had sushi from many places in Charlotte (New Zealand, Mr Tokyo,ect) but this place sets the bar to another level. I would recommend this to anybody and to ask the chef Anthony for what he recommends for the week or day!"}
{"text":"I had the cherry blossom and hot n sour soup also a few other rolls just picked by the waitress. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was nice for a romantic quiet evening. The sushi was good and I would go back but nothing really stood out as \"the best in Charlotte\". I would like to try the entrees next time."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch  three times over the past 9 months, trying a different dish each time.   Each time hoping that it would be better.  Bland food, mediocre service. Sesame chicken was a breaded, fried chicken breast sliced over rice with a sesame sauce dribbled over the chicken after plating; it tasted more like a Chik-fil-a dipping sauce than Chinese cuisine (except Chik-fil-a's chicken is better).  Fried rice was flavorless.   Second time I got the \"spicy\" stir fry with brown sauce.  While the vegetables were fresh and plentiful, there was no spice in the spicy, and the brown sauce was, well, just brown.  Nothing for a taste bud to grab on to.  Don't even remember what I got the third time.    Won't bother trying it a fourth time."}
{"text":"Went here with my bf on a weekday night, had a few other couples, mostly people coming from the office. Had a Groupon so ordered lots of food. Most everyone else had a coupon too, I overheard.   The chicken lettuce cups were the best thing we ordered. Also got two sushi rolls--the volcano and some slightly fried spicy tuna roll (forgot the name). The volcano looked kinda gross so I didn't have any. My bf ate it and said it wasn't very good. I only had a couple pieces of the slightly fried one. Oku's similar roll called the mermaid is infinitely better.   Next was two rice dish entrees. Bf got the supposedly spicy brown sauce rice dish, I got the basil flavor stir fry. Both somehow tasted the same. Edible if hungry and want sautéed veggies with protein and brown rice, but certainly nothing u savor or look forward to getting... didn't take the leftovers.   Not very good, wouldn't ever come back and pay full price. Basil is wayyy better if you want a rice stir fry dish.   Looks like a convenient spot for people at work to get food and then go up into the office tower in which the restaurant is basically located..."}
{"text":"Very basic lunch fare in a loud but attractive setting.  House salad with ginger dressing was the same as everywhere else - fresh and tasty. $3.50 or so.  The chicken with broccoli in brown sauce was at least tender but the sauce lacked much discernible flavor. $8 with white rice.  $14 and change for the above plus a diet coke. Nothing special at all that any pseudo-Chinese takeout couldn't do better. The interior design is writing checks that the kitchen can't cash.  If you are in a hurry, steer clear. It took around 40 minutes for my entree to appear.  Staff were very friendly but speed was not a strong point."}
{"text":"Used a $30 value Groupon for dinner on a Friday night. It was fairly empty inside and we had very prompt service. Waters were refilled regularly.  I ordered the Duke revolution sushi roll. It was good but not amazing. My friends both ordered the hibachi style chicken and they both seemed happy. Wouldn't go out of my way to return, but with the Groupon it's good value. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Nothing is right about this place. Service was terrible. Wait staff was unattentive. Appetizer was undercooked and sent back twice. At the end, they still made us pay for the uneaten undercooked appetizer.  Flavors were bland. Everything looked like they were dunked in a water bath and barely seasoned.    I did not order the spicy noodle soup with shrimp dish because I ended up with 75 cent Korean Shin instant ramen last time."}
