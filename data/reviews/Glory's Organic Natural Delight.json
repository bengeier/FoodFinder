{"text":"I work across the street from Glory's.   Four members of our staff ordered lunch from this restaurant today.  All four of us were delighted with our selections.  Give 'em try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find this new, organic restaurant with the most delicious soup, fresh squeezed juice, sandwiches and salads today! And they deliver if your order is over $50-during lunch?!"}
{"text":"A refreshing find in the midst of rogue valley nonsense. Great deals and great vegan options."}
{"text":"Great organic make your own salads and amazing smoothies. It Doesn't have anywhere to sit down and eat, but a great and easy place to get organic to go food!"}
{"text":"Great stop in Medford for a healthy alternative to road trip junk food. My husband ordered a veggie wrap which was refreshing and I got a blt on sourdough. The real gem for me was the juice though- mine was a \"I feel fine\" (nice nod to the Beatles on their juice menu) and he got an \"octopus garden\". Great service and terrific food."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's so nice to have healthy food in Phoenix! I get the turkey bacon guacamole- it's go good, piled high with turkey and spinach. My husband loves the pesto turkey. The I feel fine juice and the Straight C juice are our go to juices but I've had one of the blueberry smoothies that was delicious! I highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Mmm, the green smoothie was so yummy, the lime gave it a great zing! Lady running the place was very sweet and engaging. It is nice that they give you either veggies and  hummus or chips and salsa with a wrap, I like to get as many veggies in a day as I can. This will be my new go to lunch spot when I'm traveling through the Medford area!"}
{"text":"The smoothies here are so good and the service is great. Can't wait to come back for vegan tamales (:"}
{"text":"This just became one of my favorite places to eat at! I got the vegan wrap and it was AMAZING! Very filling, lots of fresh vegetables, and their hummus tops it off. The service was incredibly quick and welcoming. I hope to see this family shop succeed!"}
