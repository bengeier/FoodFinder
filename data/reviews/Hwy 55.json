{"text":"Awesome burgers with side fries and gravy. Service was really good. One of the best burgers ever!!! Soft bun, andy size burger with extra fried onions."}
{"text":"Food here is OK, nothing special. Like the previous Yelpers have mentioned cleanliness and service is good. Food is OK. Chicken sandwich was good. Everything fried had taste of old oil where it taste burnt even though it is not. They do offer somethings on the menu which are new to the halal community. Food needs to improve though."}
{"text":"Gr8 food guys thank u ! 
I loved it , hope to see a branch next to me soon , i loved the crashed ice with the pepsi my fav !"}
{"text":"Loved the decor and retro feel. We ordered Cheeseburger, Andys Double Cheeseburger, hot dog and crispy fries.  Finally a spot that serves good halal dogs. The beef patties were good as well. I liked how they had 4 different cheese options for the cheeseburger. The only thing that I didn't like was the size of my cheeseburger, it was the size of a jr mac  Andys size is the full size burger. Also you can't make any of yoyr meals a combo you gotta order your drinks and fries separately. The good thing was you get a whole basket of fries instead of a few combo side size. We'll definitely be visiting Hwy55 again"}
{"text":"So now that \"Licks\" was gone I thought I'd take the family to this new \"Fifties Style\" burger place. Burger was great, they have no bacon :( , fries were under cooked, baskets the food came in left no where to squirt ketchup for dipping, no utensils on the tables or offered when food came.  Price was totally ridicules for what you got. Suffice to say, South Street Burgers are better, have bacon and NY fries, and is about 3/5th the cost. Hwy 55 won't last when they charge with tip $60 for 3 adult meals and a kids combo.  Again, the burger was really good, but the fries were horrible and the price was an insult for what you ended up getting."}
{"text":"I used to go here a lot, but anytime I went, the owner seemed uninterested in talking and was super rude to his employees. I even saw him fire someone once for messing up when they were newer. I had the shrimp and there was hair in it and the food was cold. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I think this location was a Lick's before but never went. First time tonight and the server was really friendly, a bit slow when it got busy but all around a fun 50s diner atmosphere. Food was pretty tasty and nice to have shrimp Po Boy instead of just a burger. Shake was nice and creamy ....not overly sweet or 'fake' tasting. I'd def go back."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and will now never return due to the service, which has never been great, but reached an all time low. On my last visit the waitress spent our entire meal with her back to us busy chatting with the kitchen staff in the open kitchen. My 10 year old son had to twice walk over twice to tear her away from her important conversation, once to ask for a glass of water, and the next to get the bill. All this while the owner sat there either playing on his laptop, or sitting just outside the door smoking. All done with this place."}
{"text":"Good burgers!!!  Others that I like are burger factory, bun on the run, burgernator, top gun...  It's a casual place, good family environment, old school diner ambiance, with good burgers (not awesome, but good).  I will return."}
{"text":"what a let down, paid $32 in today for my wife and I and all we had was a cheese steak, john boy burger, fries and a lemondade.. where to begin

the steak was undercooked, burger was TINY for $8.. it was literally done in 2 bites.. the fries were cold when served and the lemondae was carbonized water with a splash of lemon juice.. 

all in all, will not be returning.. will not be referring.."}
{"text":"Ambience and cleanliness and service gets full mark however food was a lil more than average..kids loved the cardboard cars dat come along with the kids meal..it wasnt a bad experience but wsnt an outstanding one either"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. I ordered the burger. It was good and their onion rings are great. 

My girlfriend got the grilled cheese. And she enjoyed it aswell."}
{"text":"I tried their Chicken Cheesesteak Sandwich  it  tasted great and was ok but not filling. Their portions in my opinion  are small and was not filling.  Service at this location is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"The food was great! I had the shrimp sandwich and it was delicious. Fresh and clean food, though all of the utensils were disposable...  The price is reasonable if a bit expensive! Good experience overall."}
{"text":"Great food and service. It gets amazing when the food is halal. We had 

1- John boy & billy BBQ burger ( don't over do with extra sauce or you will lose the flavor of the meet but over all I would rate this is 3 out of 5 ( 5 being the best )

2- cheese Steak was our second item and this was by far well made a bit dry which make me think that we needed extra hot Sauce but less BBQ sauce. I could taste the meet and it was far best stake I have had in Toronto ( I mean in halal option) Over all this is also rated at 3 out of 5 

3- chili cheese fries was our 3rd item and man this was by far the best dish I ordered and could be the show stopper for me, I think I can Oder this only if I feel like eating some good quick bite. I would give 4 out of 5 only because it tasted very settled and yum 

This place is clean and the service is good as well, very friendly people and ambiance is great as well. I would rate my trip to this place over all about 3.5 out of 5"}
{"text":"The place is great in atmosphere and the servers are super friendly. Food is awosome and highly recommended diner.

The burgers is a must and the gravy also"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Actually a 4.5 stars. 

There used to be another restaurant in this location so this highway 55 is fairly new. This was my first visit to it and I was more than pleased. The service was quick and our food arrived without much wait. 

Speaking of food, I ordered the cheesesteak with a few extra toppings (chili, jalape√±o peppers, etc)  and it was delicious! The price was under 10$ (before tax) and I felt it was a well worth meal, much better and tastier than meals I have had from places like kelsey, BP, etc. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this location to a friend and will be visiting back again sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Well. All I have to say is that this place will not last. The food was well below acceptable for a Diner and the lunch didn't start on the right foot. Actually my little girl almost got seriously injured on their very slippery mosaic black and white floor. Her feet went flying beneath her and was hurt. I was very disappointed to say the least and miss having Licks at this location. Perhaps a hip shawarma  spot would do the trick at this quite busy location."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Hwy 55. The burger was fresh and the fries with gravy was great. The gravy did not taste like it was from a package, but made in house. 

It is a very \"southern American\" chain, so I was suprised to see it had made its way up to the Great White North. 

It offers traditional southern favourites such as sweet tea which is not the same thing as iced tea! They offer massive shrimp po' boy and on the menu their cheese is labeled using the American terms such as American and Pepperjack. They will also give you a drink to go at no extra charge if you ask them when you get your bill. It's the true southern way! 

I was a little confused as to what the restaurants trying to accomplish. I saw the owner sitting outside smoking more than once durning my meal and I don't think the staff have been versed at all in the true southern way that chain operates. 

The majority of the staff were very young girls who seemed very shy and not too sure what they actually should be doing most of the time. They were very polite though. 

The restaurant was very clean and has the look of a 50's style type diner. Good value for the price.

The food was good, but the atmosphere confused me, so I'm not sure whether or not I will be back. TBD next time I have a burger craving!"}
{"text":"A very good cheese steak Sandwich, very rich in mushrooms and juicy. My kids had burgers and orange juice, they like their meals and the way of presentation, quality overall is good , great and clean atmosphere. (Hallal option)"}
{"text":"This place is no longer operating as Hwy 55 it is called Gazebo. Yelp needs to update this page."}
{"text":"First of all the food is Halal.  The service was good and the food itself was also very good. Had the burgers and chicken strips and all of it was very good.  Will definitely go again.  My 3rd visit here and j can definitely say the food is really good.  Love their burgers!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the look of old us diner but I did not like my hamburger the bread did not taste fresh , fries are basically frozen deep fry mcain type , price is good  , but I was expecting more, the staff is very courteous"}
{"text":"went there for the first and last time.  the place is nice and clean but the food is awful.  nothing special about the taste of food or the menu.

On top of that they screwed my order twice.  They took the burger back and the chef using his fingers removed the unwanted toppings.

Then this little server girl blow her nose off with her hands and a napkin, and went straight to the food serving to customers WITHOUT caring to clean her hands.

I am never going back to this place again.  Yes they are nice and clean but if the food and the servers are not clean then this place is not for me."}
{"text":"First time here and had a hotdog. The dog was very good! Especially the topping they offer. It took a little time but it's worth trying."}
{"text":"I love old fashioned diners and I've been wanting to come here for a while, I came with my boyfriend Saturday night around 8. It wasn't busy, we walked in unsure if we were to seat ourselves or order at the counter, a few minutes later a server said to choose where to sit so we did she brought us our menus and left without offering us a drink or specials, she went behind the counter to chat and laugh for ten minutes with other staff before returning for our orders. I asked what the difference between a regular and Andy's size was for the burgers, regular was basically a slider and Andy's was a McDonald's sized patty which cost extra. we were hungry so we both ordered the \"bigger\" size single cheeseburger with crispy fries. The meals came out fast but we were disappointed with the burgers. So small. The \"american\" cheese was basically a kraft singles slice and our wonder bread buns were so soggy and wet I couldn't even eat my burger I was so disgusted. My boyfriend ate it because he was so hungry and his was too small. The fries were okay, tastes the same as Costco but double the price. Finally flagged down our waitress for the cheque, the meal came to 38$ for soggy burgers and fries! She gave us the cheque and walked away to go chat with a staff, I went to ask if I should pay at the front or leave the money on the table she said it was up to me. I left my 40$ on the table and left never to return. Cute decor and good idea, just needs more fair pricing, better food and more professional staff."}
{"text":"Ordered burgers and milk shakes. Both were wonderful. 
Reason for 3 stars, everything was over priced. And parking is very limited to less than 15 spaces. The milkshake was $6.50plus tax. The meal was $36 for two burgers plus tip with milk shake on top. 

The decor was nice, really well done and retro-ish. But the white light they used quickly gave me a headache. Im sure it wouldn't have bother us if we had gone during the day. 

Service was great when we went (April 2015) although there was only 1 server on deck. 

Recommended ONLY for milk shake lovers."}
{"text":"This location (Oakville) has all Halal meat.  Had the Andy's size (twice the regular size patty) cheeseburger with all the fixings (jalapenos, grilled mushrooms, grilled onions, grilled bell peppers, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mustard, etc.) and a Chocolate shake.  Both were good, but I liked the shake the best since it was thick and the whip cream was the real deal.  Nicely decorated interior of the restaurant with 50's style diner and memorabilia."}
{"text":"We went in not knowing what to expect, given the 2.5 star rating on Yelp. But we were pleasantly surprised! We went with their burger/fries/drink meal and it was excellent. Took a bit of time to get the food, but it was worth the wait.

The decor is very nice too and helped create a very nice, old school aroma to the overall experience. This is a bit on the expensive side, but certainly a place I'd gladly suggest to others!"}
{"text":"I don't know exactly what HWY 55 is trying to do. They want to be an \"American style diner\", and yet this is quite obviously in Canada, where the market is different. Does this work? No. No, it does not. Because unlike the Fifties Diner, or even the old Licks, it did not offer a \"diner experience\".

The atmosphere strikes you immediately. Great decor, but there were more staff than there were customers, and thus you had a lot of people standing around, chatting loudly and doing no work whatsoever. This would be fine if my girlfriend, mother-in-law and I had gone to the late night service, but this was the dinner rush. 

The food was, I'm sorry to say, absolutely dreadful. I ordered a cheeseburger, my M.I.L ordered a regular burger and my girlfriend (soon to be wife) ordered a poutine. The waitress was kind and polite: about the only good part of the meal. The waiting time was acceptable. We didn't order appetizers. 

Presentation of the food was decent enough...except for the poutine. My wife's food looked like someone had scraped crappy water out of a toilet bowl and smeared it onto what was supposed to be a \"poutine\". It tasted about the same--cold and shameful. She also distinctly tasted beef when she was assured that the gravy was vegetarian. Obviously, she didn't finish her food. I found my burger to be overly greasy and extremely small. Considering that a cheeseburger meal is about 14$, it was very underwhelming and I felt ripped off. I was still hungry after finishing the burger and fries.

Poor business model and organization. As has been said many times, the owner seems to play favourites with \"friends of the family\", instead of trying to run the business and improve their poor customer service skills. The owner may also have a sexist streak, as ALL of the wait staff were female and wore pink, and ALL of the cooking staff were male and wore blue. I understand that this is a fifties environment and that's to be expected, but when the food is so ridiculously expensive and so ridiculously heinous, your last worry should be the aesthetics of your staff. I'm also quite sure that the labour board of Ontario wouldn't approve of such sexist hiring practices.

Overall, not a good experience. HWY 55 is insulting to Diners everywhere...you might as well just go to the Fifties Diner on Speers instead.

Skip."}
{"text":"The place was decorated nice and the taste of the burger was good but that's about it for the positive comments. I recommend you have a snack at home before going here because the portions are tiny and over priced. Oh and to the management I suggest you train your staff before opening. The waitress asked ME what was on the specialty burger I was ordering. I had to read it out to her! Also no matter what flavor of milkshake you order expect it to taste like vanilla."}
{"text":"My colleague, Shahid, and I had lunch today at Hwy 55.  It has a fun retro interior.

I ordered The Original Special with mustard, ketchup, Jack cheese, pickles and tomatoes along with crispy fries.  It was a good burger.  The burger was dense but tender and had good flavour.  The bun was soft and warm because it's steamed.  The crispy fries were indeed crispy.  I had the burger and had just a few fries because I was full.  I'd get it again.

Shahid ordered a Cheeseteak and crispy fries.  He said the sandwich was really good and he'd get it again.

I'd go back!  Shahid said he'd go back too and would like to take his family.  It worked for him because he and his family only eat halal meat and that's what they serve at Hwy 55."}
{"text":"Went in with very high hopes, that were dashed within the time that we were there. The place looked really cool like an old 50's joint, it seems that they have put all of their efforts into decorating and very little into everything else. People seemed to be served quickly based on if they knew the owner, and our food came out late and very cold. The burgers were about the size or possibly smaller than a kids cheeseburger at McDonald's and not as good. The food was far too expensive for the quality and portion size. It was better as a Licks."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to having a great diner in the area with reliable hamburgers and fries- while the decor is fun and the staff were friendly and attentive, the food certainly missed the mark.

We ordered the chicken fingers and the chicken burger with fries.  Both seemed to be slopped together with little care, and even less regard for taste. 

People go to restaurants to eat food. The food at Hwy 55 is atrocious. You do the math."}
{"text":"With great anticipation, I was very disappointed. Drive through not opened yet, but it gave me the opportunity to go inside and see the menu and restaurant. Logistically they aren't ready for takeout... Clumsy packaging which fell apart by the time I got home. Small portions, not very tasty and expensive for what you get. I received a half a basket of fries - (fries were not home cut) and canned gravy. Didn't finish my triple burger as it was too greasy. Missed opportunity to establish a new local favourite -- aren't we all searching for a great burger and fries? Hwy 55 did not make my list. Too bad as I was hoping for a local \"Five Guys\"..."}
