{"text":"We were pretty excited to see that we were getting a new bar in uptown, went the first week they were open. So impressed by the beer selection. You get an ipad instead of a menu with all the beers on draft, bottled, mixed drinks, etc., its nice to browse all the beers. Only complaint with the ipad is that you cannot search by beer type, so you can't filter out all the ipas or porters or whatever you're in the mood for. They also do a beer club, so we immediately signed up for that. Drink specials cant be beat especially given the beer selection. We watched 2 UNC games here, both times we were told the wait would be over an hour but they managed to get us in after waiting only 30 minutes. Food was good: sweet potato fries with the sweet glaze are amazing. The service was great, we had some confusion with the check but the manager came over and was super helpful getting things straightened out. Can't wait to keep coming back and rack up those beer points."}
{"text":"The food was good. The service was good. The beer was great. When I finished my meal, I told the bartender I was going out to get a growler to fill. That's when I found out Duckworth's will only fill their own growlers. i find that policy to be totally unacceptable. I'm not going back and I encourage beer lovers to stay away. There are lots of places with good food and great beer. I won't support a policy so at odds with the craft beer movement."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I loved the sweet potato fries and the cheesesteak is the best all around. The atmosphere is very entertaining and the servers all work as a team. I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Great location! Service was questionable. Food was delicious! Definitely check out the Cellar downstairs. Their food and atmosphere are both outstanding!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location quite a few times.  Every time my bartender is Melissa.  I couldn't ask for a more funny, lively or energetic person to talk to us like we were her best friend.  Beer selection is phenomenal and food is decent.   Melissa always seems in control of what sometimes seems like an out of control atmosphere.  We will continue to come back as long as she is there making us laugh and have a great time.  There are also plenty of TVs to watch in case you are there on a sunday or Monday for football!!!!  We will definately be back.  The only problem we have ever had is it does take a little while to get your food, other than that it's great!!!!"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that I am a server at an upscale restaurant in uptown Charlotte. I have worked in the service industry for many years, starting as a bartender in a pub and then moving on to fine dining service. I have started coming to Duckworth's after work, when I get off late, because they serve food until 2am (awesome) and are a short walk from my apartment. The few times I have been there have been great. I hardly ever write reviews, but I think that my last experience there warrants one. I sat at the bar and a woman greeted me and took my order. Nothing special, I ordered a beer and some food. Well...I found out that the beer that she poured for me was the wrong one, after I had already drank it. I was looking forward to trying a particular new beer. There were also 2 things wrong with my order that I clearly specified to her when ordering. I understand that she was not the bar \"closer\" and was seemingly trying to get out of there, but that is no excuse for careless service; 3 things wrong between my food and beverage order. I also understand having a bad night, but once again, no excuse for 3 things completely wrong. Steve (I found out his name by looking at the receipt) took over the bar as the \"closer\" and realized the mistakes and corrected them. He has waited on me a few times and always has a great attitude and gives wonderful service. He was the only one behind the bar when I was winding down my meal. He had a full bar along with \"service bar\" and handled it like a pro. Steve, thank you for your wonderful serivce, attention to detail and hard work. I'll be back."}
{"text":"First timer....went in set in the bar area...OMG are any waitresses on duty.. Is this a self service restaurant...took the waitress forever to take our our order...took a extra forever for our drinks to be served...took a double extra double forever for waitress to bring out our drinks ....I'm just a little freaking hot under the collar by now...finally time to order dinner ... Okay by the time breakfast (that's how long it took to our order back to the table) came I was just not a happy camper...1st impression are not in favor with this restaurant.. OUR server was slow as hell. Hey I'm hungry now not tomorrow....WILL NOT RETURN...MY ADVICE TO YOU \" IF YOU ARE HUNGRY LOOKING FOR GREAT SERVICE AND FOOD ...KEEP WALKING PASS THIS LOCATION...AS A MATTER OF FACT RUN"}
{"text":"Came for my birthday and it was all amazing! The atmosphere and food was great and Jeremy was on point! Will definitely be coming back, but be prepared for a lot of sports fans if any big game is on!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever had in my life. Management was so terrible. Yall should really hire some new staff because you just lost a party of 20 that will tell all their friends how terrible you are. Terrible terrible service"}
{"text":"The place has 107 TVs throughout and can get pretty loud but we also went on a Saturday night so the volume is to be expected. Great location. Great food. Great service. Expect this place to be hoppin with lots of seating and open air.  Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"I've been going to Duckworths for years on Park Road, and was excited when they were opening up the new location downtown. I was even more excited to learn of the massive draft selection that they were going to be offering.  Unfortunately, like many newly opened locations, the service starts to eventually slip.  We actually stopped going to there for the past several months, but we were downtown for a work event last night and decided to give it another try. We sat at the bar, and waited and waited and waited. The bar area was very busy as it was just a little after six. I don't know why, but the management at that location seemed to think that two bartenders were enough to service the packed bar area plus all of the drink orders coming in from the servers.  I can't believe for a restaurant that size that no other servers or managers were able to assist at the bar.  After close to 20 minutes of not even being acknowledged or having a bartender come down to the end of the bar, we just got up and left.  The people at the bar sitting closest to us were also frustrated and sitting there with empty glasses. A couple of the guys were trying to wave the bartenders down because they were so concentrated on servicing the far end of the bar where the waitstaff was picking up beer orders for the tables instead.  Unfortunately,having one of the best draft selections in town does not make up for the lack of service. So I will turn in my beer card and move on."}
{"text":"Went here to watch Panthers game, excellent service from Amanda all the time we were there. Great atmosphere, outstanding beer selection..Bacon chicken wrap was great..Will come back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight to watch the game 4 finals and thank goodness we got there early because the place got PACKED. Dominique the bartender was amazing! She had a smile on her face and made sure we always felt taken care of. Her and the other guy (blonde hair) that was working with her worked great as a team! Everyone around us was greated with a sweet demeanor even though they were getting killed with streamers of drink tickets. If you want to watch a game and get get some drinks from some awesome bartenders go see them!"}
{"text":"I had a great meal here last night with some co workers.  The service was good and the food was quite tasty.  

The place was packed and they seated our group of 6 quickly.   I will certainly return here when i am in town."}
{"text":"Went there to watch the Cubs payoff game.  Lot's of TVs and the wings were great.  The beer special was an IPA which we appreciate."}
{"text":"I had to take off one point. A little pretentious and more expensive for what you get (there are tons of places in Charlotte with great deals on beer). Having said that, I've been here a couple of times at least, the food is great and they make a great smoked old fashioned (it's a show; they burn a wood chip at the Bar and use the smoke to infuse the drink). Overall a pretty good place."}
{"text":"I Love this place it's the most friendly place and uptown Charlotte North Carolina.   It's such a wonderful place we had to come back every single night we were here and we had the most amazing server Darius,   He is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Attended the soft opening here this week and it was well worth it! The location is great and the decor and atmosphere was causal and laid back. Newly remodeled with TVs EVERYWHERE on the 2nd level! Any sports you want to see I am sure they have it here for you too watch! The food was great and our server was attentive and very helpful. Can't wait to come back! Especially once football season kicks off!"}
{"text":"I ordered the spring salad with salmon it was excellent!  The salmon was grilled to perfection and the dressing was great a res berry vinaigrette very garlicky and sweet. The candied pecans were a nice tuch.  Service was quick and friendly"}
{"text":"I will first say i was pleased with the food quality,  but not much else.  I know this restaurant is new but i felt borderline like i was in an episode  of OZ.  I dont like being treated like im in prison.  The air of the waiters and management  is shadey.  They actually  think i didnt notice the eye signals they pass to each other.

I went upstairs to look at the establishment.   It was not blocked  off.  I heard one of them say, he \"he went upstairs\".   If its not available  to the public.  Why is is open to access?  I came down the stairs the female manager was standing there with a fake pagent smile.  Watching my every move.

I went to smoke outside.  I saw the same female manager and two guys go around the corner in the alley for a few minutes .  Not sure if she was prostituting  or getting  high.   (True story) Worried about me.  You need to worry about your employees how they conduct themself and how your paying consumers  are treated.  

And i dont want anything  for free.  So save the coupons  and certificates for Christmas."}
{"text":"We came for lunch and had a great experience. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Although it is a bar, it was family friendly and had a great kid's menu. Or waiter, Sam, was very kind and knowledgeable about the menu. He was even good with kids and talk to them like people instead of talking down to them. I wish we lived closer to Charlotte because we would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Sooooo glad we found this uptown spot! Great sports bar (even at 1000 pm on a Sunday night)!! Food was excellent, as was the service.  Prices very reasonable.  We'll be back again! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"To be fair, the other two locations I've had better experiences there.  I'm not a huge fan of their beer menus being alphabetical as I'd rather search by style of beers - this is not an option.
Back to Uptown Ducksworth's.  Friday at 7pm - the bar is not packed and I'm being ignored by most of the staff behind the bar.  After finally settling on 10 beers for 2 flights, I'm corrected by a manager-in-training who is not knowledgable about his drink menu but does correct me on the flights are 4 not 5 each.  It took a while to get them and he didn't announce nor offer which was what  beer (I had an idea but I was glad to have another bartender write everything down to confirm).  The guy who served us couldn't make recommendations other than he likes IPAs...  I didn't need the help as I'm a big beer drinker and know my way around a tap, but it could've helped his tip if he engaged us in conversation - There's 151 beers to choose from, surely he should know more than one type!!
Bathrooms were not as clean as I'd assume a brand spanking new bar/restaurant should be and as early in the evening as it was.  And I can promise they would run out of all supplies halfway through the evening due to the minimal amount that was stocked in the ladies room.  
I didn't eat at this visit.  Overall, it was ok.  I might go back if someone drags me, but I'd rather go to the other two locations (Faith in South Charlotte is an AMAZING server!)
There's a bajillion TVs!  If you want a mediocre domestic brew and 5 different sports playing at once with meh service - you should go here."}
{"text":"This Duckworth's needs to try a little harder. On a Friday night with hardly anyone there, we had the worst service I've ever had at a Duckworths. The place was understaffed, poorly managed and the bartenders spent more time talking to themselves instead of mixing drinks. We wound up leaving an hour after we arrived with only one round in us. The other two locations are spot on, so I don't know why this one was such a disappointment."}
{"text":"I've frequented the Duckworth's in Ballantyne and service and food has always been good. 

I recently decided to call in an order for pick up at the North Tryon location and went I came home and started eating my blackened chicken ceasar wrap, I noticed a light brown strand of hair lodged in my wrap (I have jet black hair, btw.) Needless to say I threw the rest of the wrap away. Wasted my $10. 

Won't eat here again. Maybe the chefs should try pulling their hair back and wearing hair nets, because there's absolutely no excuse for this. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Decent food, I mostly always have the boneless chicken wings in their gold sauce, they don't disappoint. Its a sport's bar with a ton of tv's in every direction. The beer selection is a little daunting for me, but it works for a variety of tastes. service is hit or miss and it is not because they were extremely busy that one afternoon. 

I mainly choose this as option to appease most tastes in a group outing."}
{"text":"Came here once for a friend of mine's birthday, and let me just say - this place is GREAT. We had the fried banana peppers for an appetizer which were amazing. There's over 100 beers on tap to choose from which is really cool if you're a beer fan. I got the BBQ wings too which were really good. And even though they were busy, the service was still great and they were very friendly with us. I will definitely be back for my husbands birthday this year!"}
{"text":"We needed a place to have our son's (and new daughter-in-law's!) rehearsal dinner - and their upstairs private room at this location was perfect!! We worked with Kenny (manager) and Rob Duckworth, and they were so helpful. Rob helped us design a meal package within our budget - and we still had everyone's favorite on the menu!! The food was incredible (as usual), and everyone had more than enough. We were able to take some leftovers home and feed our out-of-town visiting family too! 
They have a projection and sound system installed in the room, which allowed us to play our own slideshow/powerpoint, with music, and then enjoy our own hand selected music during dinner. The controls were very easy to operate! They even allowed us to come in and decorate before hand with some special items to help us extend that intimate, family setting.
We had two special servers helping us throughout the evening - and they were just perfect. Quick, helpful, accommodating and friendly - even to helping us box our leftovers. 
All in all - Duckworth's was the perfect solution for us. I highly recommend this location, and encourage all to check out their private room for private functions like business meetings, working lunches, showers, rehearsal dinners, private parties of any sort.  
We could not have had such a marvelous, special night without Duckworth's."}
{"text":"A great experience. The server was good and had detailed knowledge of the beer selection, was attentive (but not overly so) and courteous. Also the fact there are $3.50 pint nights. Home run!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but service was great. Went for a football event and the servers were awesome. Fast and polite, they were on point!"}
{"text":"An excellent selection of beer. They have iPads with the entire beer list. See a beer you like, tap on it to get more info. Beer snobs may take a long time filtering through the list. 

I had the Baja Fish Tacos. There were two tortillas, but enough fish and toppings to easily make 3 tacos. A good spice level, but I spread the salsa on the tacos instead of using the tortilla chips. I found the chips to be stale, but I was only interested in the tacos.  

There are daily specials all week long. Stop in and check the place out. Good showing of NC craft beers."}
{"text":"This place hit on all cylinders. Atmosphere was perfect if you're looking for a sports bar that you can't find on every corner. For beer lovers, this place is a must-visit. Service was good--friendly without being overbearing. To top it off, the food was outstanding.  If you have the opportunity, make it happen."}
{"text":"I just ordered Nachos to-go (through Postmates) and I am literally appalled. I will NEVER go back to Duckworth's again. My nachos and cheese are burnt and completely inedible. I can't even fathom what restaurant would EVER send something like this to a PAYING CUSTOMER."}
{"text":"Management was HORRIBLE the night of Oct 1 2015 and does not understand two things:
1. they are a BAR.
2. Well-behaved, paying customers are a GOOD thing and you should not run them off.
I will NEVER go to this place again after the horrific customer service a couple of members of our party received."}
{"text":"Pros:  Nice, clean place.  Lots of beers on tap.

Cons: Food is meh.  Good fries.  The half-lb burger was actually two overcooked quarter-lb patties--should have mentioned that on the menu, as that's not the same thing at all.  The chips and salsa appetizer were weak: pre-packaged corn chips plus bottled salsa for $4.99?  C'mon, Duckworths: make your own.

Bottom line: good place to come for a beer, I suppose, but spend your money elsewhere if you're looking to eat."}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets a 3 is because of the beer selection. 

Bartender Boe is a pampas ass and lacks customer  service and tending skills.  He was not up to date on drinks, infact i had to explain to him how to make a Godfather.

Casey is a 360 of Boe, so if you have a choice, go with Casey!  If Boe is the only one here......rum as fast as u can to SIP (down the street) and see Marti!  I had to explain it to her as well but at least she made it with a smile and it was tasty! 

BTW, the \"MerBear Rye IPA\" is decent......"}
{"text":"I would normally rate Duckworth's pretty high when I have been there on a normal night. However, last night was the ACC Championship in Charlotte. It's a sports bar uptown so they should be ready for the large crowd. They had no idea how to accommodate us. Service was slow, they ran out of FRENCH FRIES and small pizzas, and the blue cheese chips were awful - half a bottle of blue cheese dressing just tossed on. There was also something wet on the ground and soberly I slipped and fell. I let a waitress know of the wet spot and an hour later walked in that same spot and almost slipped and fell again. They need to learn how to serve big crowds."}
{"text":"Someone should have told them it was the ACC championship game day. Really? Horrible service. We had to ask for someone to check on our chips and queso. Stayed for the humor of it all."}
{"text":"Best beer selection in Charlotte! Especially when it comes to seasonal beers. 

The nachos are also a must have, but huge!"}
{"text":"Over the last couple of years, my wife and I have been to this Duckworth's a few times. Although not five star stellar, I would generally rate our previous experiences a solid 3.5 to 4. Lots of tap beers (very nice), decent food, and the service is pretty ok. Not super great, but decent. The bartenders are friendly, albeit a little slow. I think sometimes they simply are a bit understaffed.

Last night we stopped in for a quick drink and a snack before heading next door to a show. We ordered a Caprese - which was fresh and tasted fine. The problem occurred with our beer. Both my wife and I ordered beer that was located in the center section of the taps (I had a Bell's Two Hearted, can't remember what the wife had) - the beer was foaming very badly, and they were having a hard time getting good pours out of the taps. The bartender mentioned that they had recently cleaned the lines and they were trying to get the lines calmed down after that.

Although the beer tasted ok (maybe a bit off, but not terrible) I am convinced that there was some type of cleaner still in the lines. We left Duckworths, went to the show (wife had one beer there and myself a glass of red wine) and then we went home. Today, we have spent the entire day in bed - not sick from food poisoning, but from some type of poisoning. Other than the two different drinks we had at the theater, Duckworths was the only place we had food and drink at.

I don't think we are going to die... but we have both felt pretty awful all day. Can I prove it was something in the beers lines? No..... but my common sense leads me to that conclusion.  I have never seen beer that out of control foamy.... something was clearly wrong or still in the lines."}
{"text":"This was my first time and the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. We ask for a spot by the window to watch the bicycle race and they were happy to give me a spot even though they were crowded.. Then we had more friends join us and we needed a bigger table and again they let us pick the spot and give us a window seat. The food was good and the wine bottle prices seemed to be reasonable. We will be back again I am sure."}
{"text":"A lot of good beers on tap.  Came on a Saturday night.  Understaffed and took awhile to grab a beer.  Got the Buffalo Philly Chicken Snadwich and not worth it.  All bread with little meat for $10.99.  Good time but wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with co-workers (party of 6) to eat and to watch a little of the noon ACC Tournament game.  Had a good crowd, and even had a little wait which was understandable.  We also had to wait a little longer than anticipated for the food, but the wait staff and management were very good and acknowledged our wait.  They took care of us like good restaurants with good management do, and rectified the situation.  The food was great as usual at Duckworth's.  They did an awesome job renovating the old Fox and Hound, it's beautiful.  I've never seen that many TV's at a restaurant.  There's not a bad seat in the place!  Bear with them, they've only been open for about 10 days and they are ironing out all the kinks!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, below average food. Service was awkward, not knowledgable, and overall not the best. iPads explaining beers were really neat! Lots of TVs. Lots of homeless outside and I felt unnerved walking back to car. Was disappointed that I asked for a bottle of beer. They brought it and it was huge.  Wound up costing $18 and I didn't drink it because it was terrible. There are no prices on menu so I wish waitress would have told me the beer I chose was huge and expensive! I assumed bottles of beer were all typical 12 oz and under $7 or so. Guess the assumption was my fault but I'm not s huge beer person and would never have even thought to ask the price!"}
{"text":"Went to Duckworth's in uptown on Saturday for dinner with friends. We sat upstairs which was nice (quieter atmosphere). Taylor was our server. She was very nice & helpful. I had the cheesesteak supreme which was awesome as were the fresh cut fries that came with it!!! I tried the Sycamore salted coconut beer. Very Good also!! We all walked out very happy and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Yum yum queso! Duckworths is a great place for bar food. We went on a Wednesday evening to enjoy a nice Philly cheesesteak. The service was great, our servers name was Steven. The food was good as well. My friend had tacos and the Caesar wrap. We also ordered the queso for an appetizer and it was pretty good. The Philly cheesesteak was my favorite though. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A group of ladies and I wanted to try a restaurant close to a lounge we were visiting and Ducworth's was suggested.  Our party of six was promptly seated and provided menus.  Since our group was not familiar with the menu, our server patiently walked us through the many options.  We noticed the blurb near the wings and inquired if they were really good.  Needless to say, the wings and the Taphpusr Flatbread did not disappoint.  Our server, Thurston was attentive, promptly refilled drinks and frequently checked on us.  I could not believe how reasonable the food was, especially once I saw the portion sizes.  The atmosphere was festive and having the variety of screens was a delight.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game. TVs everywhere and they have every sports package. They'll turn on any game you want. The food is very good. The nachos are enormous. The wings are great.
Staff are attentive and friendly. Special shout out to the bartender Johnathan who always makes me laugh and have a good time. Hope to see him behind the bar more frequently!
All in all, this is definitely one of he better places in uptown to visit."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection. Big craft beer fan. Had the tater tots, can't go wrong with those. Then the shrimp tacos. They were great and a bit spicy. This is a chill place to go to watch sports, drink, and some grub. Selection of food is pretty good to so there's definitely something for everyone."}
{"text":"We landed here by accident as we were originally going to the Cellar.  They have soo many taps, I ran out of fingers and toes trying to count them all.  They definitely have something for everybody. I really love that they have a large selection of local breweries on tap in addition to some of those smaller ones from far away.  It really gives you the opportunity to try a beer you may never have had the chance or knew existed. With such a vast selection I am curious as to how often they rotate their list."}
{"text":"This review is for drinks and service only.

Stopped in to get out of a crazy thunderstorm and are glad we did! Huge beer selection and a ton of TVs - would be a great place to watch football. The beers were great and the service was fantastic and friendly.

Will return....."}
{"text":"The ribs were dry.  Don't order them.  The best part of the wings and ribs dish was the tatie tots"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate a friends engagement. We had a private room and about 3 severs who were taking care of us. Service was really good! Servers were friendly and helpful. Food was really good as well. I had wings and my flavors were hot teriyaki and hot bbq. I wasn't really impressed with the hot bbq but the other flavor was amazing! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Our sever \"Autumn\" seemed very rushed and we had to yell what we needed as she ran by. While the food is good and the tv's are great for a Sunday football game the service was horrible. I thanked her as she brought our plates, drinks and refilled our coffee and she never responded with any gratitude. She needs to slow down and offer better customer service or find a new job."}
{"text":"Try the wings! Good place to watch a game and grab a beer.... don't order a flight of beer...they are really small...more like shots. 

Here is a quote from my coworker/ friend \"the meat falls off the bone\" that means order the ribs."}
{"text":"Came in and sat at the bar after the Hornets game. It was a little after 10 but the kitchen stays open late so the entire menu was still available.

The amount of beers on draft is impressive and overwhelming but the bartenders were more then willing to offer some help and recommendations.

The Mommoo's wings were awesome and you could definitely taste the vinegar base they're coated with. The Jalapeño chicken dinner was equally delicious and their coleslaw was very good.

A little pricey for one person but you are in the city. Would go back the next time I'm in Charlotte based on the beer selection alone."}
{"text":"Great place for a game, not for a dinner. TVs are the main star at this restaurant, not the food. 

Staff was attentive and friendly, no complaints there. 

Restaurant has a great selection of beers and is presented on an iPad so it makes it easy to select. A decent selection of mixed drinks is offered as well. 

Food was average and no thought is given to presentation. Food is much like a Chilis or a TGiFridays. We ordered cupcakes for dessert and they did not have all of the flavors in stock, so really instead of getting four distinct flavors we had to have multiples of one.

Bottom line: great place to watch a game and grab a beer, not for the serious foodie."}
{"text":"Ordinarily, I'd give this place five stars, but let me explain the 3-star rating today.  I come to this location ALL the time.  The food is consistently good, I usually sit at the bar, and when I don't sit at the bar I am picking up a lunch order for my boss.  I have never had a problem here until today.  

It started when I called in an order for pickup.  It was 11:30AM, I dialed the number, heard someone pick up, silence, and then said person hung up the phone.  \"Ok.\" I thought... maybe that was an error.  So I called again.  The phone rang for a very long time.  I gave up on that call and tried one more time (understanding that I was calling to order lunch for my boss who could not get away from the office to get her own lunch).  At this point, I get someone on the phone who, as it turned out, was one of the two hostesses working today.  She took my order.  It was pretty basic; two salads, one with no alterations, and one with olives and onions excluded.  She said it would be ready in 10-15 minutes, so I walked down from my building.

Upon entering, I walked straight up to the desk, told her my name, and paid for my order.  I then proceeded to wait at the bar with one of my co-workers (who had also ordered food, but her order was sent to the bar) for the food to be ready.  She paid at the bar, got her order, and we walked back up front to collect mine.

Upon receiving my order, I found that there were olives on the salad that wasn't supposed to have them.  I got no apologies from either the hostess who took my order or the other hostess (I guess) who joined her at the front.  I asked if she could get that fixed, and she looked at me as if I were speaking Greek.  She then looked at the other hostess and proceeded to walk back to the kitchen to have them removed.

Once again, I got NO apologies for the error.  I'm not asking for tears, I'm asking for something more than a blank stare and an attitude of \"what do you expect me to do about that?\"

As I was waiting, two men in suits came in.  They were told by the other hostess that there would be a 15 minute wait, and when they asked if they should just go elsewhere, the hostess said, \"Yeah, that might be a good idea.\"  So they left.

So what I'm taking from this is that the noon lunch rush was more than these two hostesses were ready to handle today.  While I have worked in the service industry, and completely understand how stressful a hectic day can be, I would NEVER have allowed it to show on my face to a customer.  At the least, I would've apologized for the kitchen's error and done all I could to \"make it right\" as soon as possible.

Once again.  I love this place.  I love their food.  I love their bar.  I was simply disappointed in the service I received today."}
{"text":"Had the smokehouse BBQ bacon burger .pepper jack cheese made u jump like a jumping jack and the sauce was spicy like a liquid hot from a candle . Good booger . Can't complain"}
{"text":"Beer and appetizer wonderful, main course had to send back because it was not cook completely (bbq chicken) potato was warm. When sending the bbq chicken back, they returned the side to me, which would be cold waiting for the chicken to come back to me. overall experience would be, coming back for drinks but that would be it."}
{"text":"I found this place at the recommendation of the Hotel staff at The Dunhill, as I am in town for work. I was pleasantly surprised. I enjoy sports and beer. They have it all with multiple TVs and 150 beers on Tap. The bartender, Steve, is very friendly and knowledgeable about the different beers and helped me decide what would be good for me. Also, the food was great. My steak was prepared perfectly. I will definitely be back. 

I joined their beer club, so I can keep track of the beers I've enjoyed and earn points towards gifts in future visits."}
{"text":"Great Food!! 

I enjoy coming here for the margarita flat bread and the onion rings!

The ranch dressing here is Awesome!

I got the Cesar salad the last time and was disappointed. The leaves were wilty and plain sad."}
{"text":"This is such a great place!!  Not only was the food good and beers plentiful but even when it got really busy (UNC in the Final Four) the bar staff were able to keep up and still provide excellent customer service. I will definitely return again."}
{"text":"Here's an update that I hope senior management will read.

The beer list is nicely presented on an electronic tablet. You click on a beer and it brings up a fuller description of that particular beer. Some of the beers have a grade from the \"Beer Advocate\", which I assume is a real thing that rates beer.

So when I am looking for a beer, I am interested in a beer with a rating of A+ or A or A-. I don't want a B- beer. Here is my suggestion; put a sort function on the tablet that sorts according to the beer's rating. 

After 5 minutes of playing hide and go seek with ratings on the menu, I'm not loving the experience. The people I'm with aren't fascinated by watching me try to poke out a decent beer choice.

Make it easy for the customer and you'll sell more beer."}
{"text":"A ridiculous amount of tv's and taps.  If that is your thing, this is your place.  You won't find more anywhere else in Charlotte as far as I know.

For some reason it seemed like something was missing compared to the other locations, but they just weren't that busy, so i guess that changed the vibe.  Its a local chain, so they are all similar.  I'm not a huge fan of writing reviews on chains, so I'll keep this one short.  There are plenty of other great reviews on here.  I checked out a Chicago Blackhawk's game in honor of Paul C. here.  Please give his review a read.

The daily specials are normally decent deals, but outside of the cheese steak and the garlic fries I've never been that impressed with the food.  I normally complain about the prices, but they are honestly pretty reasonable compared to the competition downtown.  This place is all about the beer in my mind.

There are just way to many beers for me to mention.  Luckily they give you a tablet to explain them all.  My server wasn't that knowledgeable, so I'm glad I had that.  I'm not going to even mention my beers as they rotate them out quite often.  Unless its cold outside, I normally gravitate straight towards the IPA's and pale ales.  They had plenty of choices, even a few I had never tried before.  Loved everything.  I really like the fact that I can get Wicked Weed beers here.  That freak of nature is a great deal on pint night.  Cheaper pints on Mondays and Wednesdays at this location."}
{"text":"First off the food was great so no complaints in that department, however the service, management, and bar tender was not good. We came on an empty Sunday evening and sat at the bar for about 6 minutes with no acknowledgement. The bartender with the ponytail never looked up once. We moved to a high top and it took the server another 15 minutes to greet us. I saw a man with glasses just standing in the back watching tv (I'm assuming a manager) never came to any of the tables or even had a leadership presence. Customer service is so key people! Hire better people!"}
{"text":"This is a great sports bar. Great menu and great atmosphere. Only suggestion would be for management to do a better job monitoring the tv's because some were in HD and some were not in HD resulting in the same game being on a delay next to one another. Other than that great place. Very attentive wait staff. Would def recommend."}
{"text":"Yummy food! Husband and son loved all the TV's which were great to watch the Olympics.  We had the shrimp focaccia, lemon pepper wings, and fish tacos. 
The only complaint was the waitress wasn't exactly the friendliest server and service was pretty slow."}
{"text":"Short story: Don't order carry out when they are busy- like when there are big football games in Uptown. The food quality will be much worse than usual. 

Long story: I called in a carry out order this evening of wings and sweet potato fries. I was told the order would be ready in 30 min. It was hard to find parking, so I called 30 min later to make sure it was ready and it wasn't. I was told they needed an extra 10-15 min. I walked in 15 mi later and had to wait for them to \"find\" my order. I paid and was home 8 min later. My food was COLD. Which makes me think it really was ready within the first 30 min but the person who answered the phone didn't really check. My chargrilled wings were BURNT. 3 of 10 of the chargrilled wings were so burnt that they went straight to the trash. My regular wings were dry."}
{"text":"Came for the first game of the football season. Great service, good food, and lots of TVs! Everyone could see the games they wanted! Every plate that passed by smelled delicious and portions were large. Will definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Today was my second visit to a Duckworths ever and this has been the 2nd most unpleasant experience here. The first was yesterday when I was dining in and had to wait 45 minutes for a burger.  Today I waited an hour and a half for a BBQ sandwich. The only good I can say is they did call me when my food was ready after the 2nd time I walked over.  When I did get my food it was terrible and cold. I will be hard pressed to return. I'll give it a few weeks to see if they can work out the kinks."}
{"text":"This was my third visit in the last week for the soft opening of this new location. I've been to several other locations but this by far is the best one. The food is exceptional as far as quality and portion size, prices are great, service is Amazing, and the beer selection is like no other. They have introduced an IPad beer menu which makes it a lot easier to select a craft brew without searching through the 3 page paper menu offered at the other locations. 
My favorite dishes are the steak fajitas and ribs. Their pizza is also delicious. 
As far as parking goes it can be a little tricky especially on weekends. I highly recommend parking in the 7th Street garage which is about a block and a half away. They validate parking at the 7th Street Market for 90 min. You can also go to Brixx and grab a drink to validate for 4 hours."}
{"text":"A little intimidating to walk into 107 TVs all staring at you .... But it's awesome! The new layout is great, totally different than Fox & House was set up. As someone who is extremely indecisive, having a choice of 150+ draft beers to chose from is both a blessing and a curse. Can't wait to try them all!

Food was incredible and came out at lightning speed. Probably less than ten minutes after I ordered (and it was hot!). Order the Blackened Island Tilapia with roasted vegetables and over a bed of rice, you will not regret it. Incredible blackened flavor and the veggies were cooked to perfection. 

This location definitely holds up to the Duckworth's reputation."}
{"text":"\"The Cellar\" is a speakeasy setting downstairs from the main restaurant / bar on the ground floor.  They have their own menus and drinks that can only be ordered at the Cellar. I went to both areas and the normal Grill & Taphouse was comparable to what you normally expect from chains like TGIF. The beer selection however was outstanding with prices very very very reasonable.  Food and drinks in the Cellar was more expensive but also prepared with more care.  The Cellar is more strict with dress code and code of conduct (no standing at the bar, you must be seated).  Choose your adventure when you get there!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks. Atmosphere is romantic and casual. Get the smoked old fashioned - one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Been here for lunch a few times and for happy hour after work. Great place to hit and try a few different beers. Food is good as well - good for families too.  Tons of TVs so plenty to watch - will be fun to hit in a big game day."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Food was excellent, service with fast and accurate, and manager stopped by to talk to us. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Boatload of TVs on an October Saturday so we could see every college game in the land. Nice selection of craft beers on tap with plenty of limited run and seasonal. Typical pub food, nothing special. bartenders not particularly welcoming."}
{"text":"At least for today ......broken grill ......waiting 45 for a chicken wrap  ( still hasn't arrived ) many empty tables....."}
{"text":"Fantastic Beer list! Lots of locals and unheard beers. Great atmosphere, and a fun environment.  I haven't tried the food yet, but it looked great."}
{"text":"Great beer menu and atmosphere.   Had the Smokehouse Philly and it was a bit heavy on the bread and lacked overall flavor."}
{"text":"Sensory overload! Based on a previous viewer he was spot on...I don't know who has more tvs Best Buy or Duckworths? Extensive beer list. Out of 4 of us no one was disappointed with dinner or apps."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch one day, the food was hot( which seems to rare these days) and tasted really good. Our server was amazing. My friend and I were more than happy to leave her a good tip."}
{"text":"Beers on tap and service were great. But don't get your hopes up, the only ducks worth seeing are basic bitches taking selfies. #duckface"}
{"text":"Sunday 12/17. Our family of four, including myself, walk in around 8 for a couple drinks and some dinner. As a side note, the place was barely a quarter full at this time so there should be no excuse for slow service. The first issue we encountered was waiting 30 minutes, yes you read that right, for our beers. Our waiter quickly brought them to the table after complaining as to where they were. Besides the incredibly slow service, which seems to have reputation around that establishment, the worst part of the night was encountering Alyssa, the store manager. She was by far the rudest manager I've ever \"met\". Besides comping one of our dinners they messed up, which still took an hour to serve, she had the audacity to raise her tone of voice and talk back to us when telling her about the poor service we received that night. I rarely write reviews but because the way we were treated by Alyssa and the poor service, I felt inclined to let other's know to avoid that spot. Between slow service and awful, AWFUL customer service from the staff, especially Alyssa, we will no longer eat at that establishment and would recommend others to find a better place to eat instead."}
{"text":"Duckworths, you are better than this. I am a loyal Duckworths fan(Park road location) but this was my first time at the N. Tryon location. The server did not know anything about beer, which used to be unacceptable for Duckworths. The food for our party came out all at different times and was of super low quality. This has not been my experience before at the other locations. The only thing that didn't suck was the banana peppers. I know it's a newer location, but get it together Duckworths."}
{"text":"So we are obsessed with Duckworths in south end and we love the fact that we have one down the street in uptown!! The staff is awesome and service is amazing as usual. Why try to come a few times at least! Beer options are great and love the duckworths beer card! Must have! Wings are amazing!"}
{"text":"For bar food it was great and our waitress Kaitlin said she was new to Duckworths but definitely didn't seem like it. So many TVs and a chill vibe. Would be again."}
{"text":"Great sports watching place, tv's everywhere. Extensive beer selection. Bar Service leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Greeted quickly with a smile while the hostess was helping someone else.  
The service here was great and everyone was friendly and willing to help.
I ordered the award winning wings and the 3rd runner up.  Them were some great tasting wings.  If you like dry rub, the lemon pepper wings were awesome as well.  Lots of beers on tap here.
Overall, clean restaurant,  spacious, and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good sports bar with lots of tv's but slowest and worst service I've had in a long time. Most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"I was here on Sunday to watch the Panthers play. No shortage of tv's and the food was good. However, my service that day wasn't up to par, but I will give them another try."}
{"text":"What a great place to just hang out and enjoy yourself I have a awesome time one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Sports Sports Sports Sports Sports Sports Salad Sports Sports Sports Sports 

The amount of TV's in Duckworth's Grill & Taphouse is excessive... or PERFECT for any sports fan. Want to watch 12 games at once? Here's your bar! They have so many televisions at so many different angles that it's almost like going into the  TV section of a Best Buy, Target, and a HH Greg combined. 

The beer list is so extensive that they have Ipads for easier navigation. The waitstaff is super friendly and attentive. 

I get to try some of the fries, and ordered a little Caesar salad with dressing. Both were delicious and fresh.  Extra points for offering old bay and vinegar on your fries, or what I call \"Bishop-Style fries.\" 

If you're looking for a sports bar- step right in and thank me later."}
{"text":"Been a fan for years, been to Montford, Huntersvilles, and mostly the Mooresville location many times. I may be done with the Uptown location though. Started good, server was attentive, but I got there early for lunch and the place was empty. Food was on par as always. By the time I was done with my food and considering dessert the place had picked up and it was impossible to my server's attention. I finally gave up and got up to go talk to her in order to pay my bill so that I could get back to work. If I give the uptown location another chance, I may amend my review, but as it stands I am very displeased with their level of service. What is the point of bringing the bill right after the food if you're not going to check on the customer from then on?

Also, a server leaning over to take your order reeking of cigarette smoke is annoying."}
{"text":"Food was good, service above average, music so damn loud I could not carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"Pretty decent restaurant. I just ran in and out for sweet potato fries. My main issue was that for $6.48 (tax included), you don't get very many fries. I could have gotten a whole meal elsewhere for that price. I expected a lot more product for the amount that I paid. I'm not quite sure if or when I'll return to this location.

On another note, the host who greeted me and took my order was very friendly and I appreciated his great service. He said the fries wouldn't take long and then came right back to me and said they were making a fresh batch because they were out. I certainly appreciated the hot and fresh fries, I just wish there were more of them for the price."}
{"text":"Just left Duckworth's without being greeted after sitting there for almost 10 minutes. The crazy thing is is that there was 10 or more people standing at the host stand with who looked to be the manager. We made eye contact with them several times, but were ignored and left... also the restaurant side had 2 other tables so it wasn't like they were crazy busy.  This place needs new management too many issues every time I go."}
{"text":"TVS EVERYWHERE!!! There are so many TVs in this place it's hard to even believe without seeing it yourself. You can honestly see at least one tv every direction you turn your head, usually a few. 

The menu is quite large and I would consider the food above average for a chain. Everyone in my party enjoyed their meal. The beer prices were a little for the Charlotte area in my opinion but I believe they have a cheap beer of the day. If you are looking for a place to watch one or multiple sports simultaneously Duckworths is a great option."}
{"text":"An average restaurant with average food. This was my first visit to Duckworth's, I happened to be in town for a show next door and wanted to try something new. The building itself is an awesome space, and seemed to be well-trafficed with a lot of customers in the bar area. I was in the main dining area, which was empty other than my table; however, it was early for dinner and everyone seemed to be enjoying happy hour over at the bar. 

Overall, the food was OK; but I didn't get anything to crazy. The chips and salsa is definitely not worth the price. For $5 you get a small plate of chips and tiny saucer of salsa. If the salsa doesn't burn your tastebuds, the price will definitely burn a hole in your wallet. The buffalo chicken wrap was actually very decent, and one of the better ones I've ever had. I would definitely order it again. 

However, the apple martini summed up in one word was simply, Meh! Don't come very for the liquor, just the beer."}
{"text":"Good wings- if you like them on the dryer side, which I do! Beer specials on Monday & Wed for $3.50 is a great deal-extensive beer menu! Also has a good kids menu. I had the chicken fajitas bc they were on special. They were fine- prob would try something else next time. Friendly staff that was accommodating. My husband the Philly cheesesteak - he said it was good, but would request extra cheese next time because it was a little dryer than expected/desired."}
{"text":"Mmmm duckworths, my favorite go to. This is a place that you go when you know you want something good, but chill, not a long wait, variety on the menu, sports friendly and great food!
Now first let's talk about sports friendly. I mean there are a million TVs in this place, don't worry, you can watch the game at any spot in the restaurant. The vibe is always great on game days, for any sport and the extensive bar area with long tables to eat at with fellow sports fans makes it a great gathering place.

The food is always good. Buffalo chicken nachos that are huge, get them. All of the different type of philly cheese steaks, please get them! My husband constantly gets the chorizo burger which is life! They also have great pizzas, wraps, subs, the list can go on forever. On top of all of that there is an extensive list of drinks on tap. 
Service is usually pretty good, not perfect but i understand it can get pretty busy. Still a staple uptown and great place to enjoy a good night with friends."}
{"text":"After the movie on Saturday I decided to check my Yelp Bookmark and try a new place. So here I am. 

1) we decided to sit at the bar. It's pretty slow for a Saturday around 10pm. Hope was our bartender and server. It's only her tending to the bar area so it can take a min for her to get to you. 

2) I opted for the chicken fajitas and my friend ordered the chicken bbq flatbread. I also ordered the Sweetwater Festive Ale. The fajitas was spicy for me so I didn't finish it. My food did come at a later time than my friend so his flatbread was semi like warm by the time my food arrive. 

3) the place is clean and they do take the time to handle all that needed. I just wish Hope have more help since it's only her. I find a quite a few ppl waiting for her to check in with them. 

Overall I would stop in again if I'm at Uptown but I want to go to their South Park location first before returning to this location."}
{"text":"To start with, I would put all 5 stars on here but for some reason my reviews don't post with 5 stars.
Let me start by saying that the Speakeasy is absolutely phenomenal! Not only was the food absolutely amazing the rib-eye oh my gosh it was like eating butter was so good!! So tender and flavorful and man I wish I could get that recipe.
In addition Bobby our server was so phenomenal he truly knew his stuff.   He showed us how flavors paired on a the cheese tray.  He knew the menu better than anybody else.  The bartender made me a special sweet-tasting shot out of his imagination and it was sooooo good!
The manager Sean was also very kind very pleasant and truly knew the business and clearly likes his customers.  He spent time with my husband and I making sure that we were well taken care of and gave us insight to the history of the restaurant.
I truly am impressed.  I wish we had a restaurant even remotely close to this caliber in California.  I will be back even it means a trip just to come to this establishment."}
{"text":"We walked in with a baby and stroller, and was placed at a table with plenty of room for the stroller. The music is great and so was the food."}
{"text":"Awesome service, beer and atmosphere!!  Bartenders were very helpful and nice. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill - the paper beer menu sucks! It's in like font size 6 and doesn't have them sorted by style of beer. ... The food is still good but the service is totally hit or miss."}
{"text":"Stopped in to finish some work and grab a bite. Beer selection was extensive with both familiar choices as well as some ones I can't get back home. 

Ordered the BBQ and wing platter. Wings were exceptional while the q was good.

Service was friendly and beer was never empty. Good, casual spot!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  During football season we go there every Sunday night to watch the games.  We were there for the Super Bowl last night and it was packed.  Hands down this is our favorite sports bar - great food, massive beer selection and wall to wall televisions.  Personally we prefer to hang out in the bar, since generally the crowds are into whatever games are on and that adds to the excitement.  They almost always have a nice selection of beers on sale.  Most nights we get the buffalo chicken nachos and it is huge - more than enough for two people.  We also particularly like the Philly cheese steak sandwich and the pizzas are excellent.  Another thing to keep in mind is that they have a take out special where you can get 2 pizzas and 2 growlers for $25 - great deal!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and keep experiencing poor service from the bartenders. They're bad about not checking up on you and it's hard to get their attention because the bar is so big. Even when they're not too busy. The food is just ok. Their Montford location is much better in terms of food. 

Food tips:

The Philly Cheesesteak and Lemon Pepper wings are really good. Fajita special on Thursday is a good deal and it's pretty tasty. 

Not crazy about the hotdogs."}
{"text":"Our service for lunch was excellent! I ordered wings and a side salad- both were great! Really enjoyed the atmosphere, food, and service!"}
{"text":"I've been to the new Uptown location three times now, as I work nearby.
The first was on opening day, I swung by for a HopSlam with coworkers. I used to frequent Fox quite often, considering the location... So I immediately turned left as I walked in the door. Just kidding!The bar is now to the right. I've only been on the first floor, where there is ample seating. The lighting is always extremely bright- day & night. Too bright for my liking. And the TVs... Holy cow. For someone who doesn't even own a TV, this is overwhelming. Definitely a great spot to catch numerous games, if you don't get vertigo first.
I do enjoy there extensive beer list, which is on a easy to use IPad. Drink specials are pretty good... Most beers are $3.50 on M & W, but I believe most are between 11-14 oz pours. 1/2 price bottles of wine on Tuesday. There Hop Man Beer Club is also very easy to sign up for. I try to drink local as much as possible, and there is a decent rotation of Charlotte breweries.
I haven't had a full meal yet, more of apps/ bar food. The only thing that has stuck out so far is the Sweet & Bold wing sauce. Absolutely delicious! I could honestly eat this on anything.
Staff is pleasant. You can tell that many are still feeling things out, which is expected. 
Atmosphere could use some work, but overall pretty decent. Definitely more of a drinking spot than a place to enjoy food."}
{"text":"The new location is Big and wonderful.  I even hear they have cellars you can rent which is right up my alley.  They have many beers on tap, but seem to be missing some local options like Triple C.  The food is better at this location, but the service was lacking both times I sat a table.  They were fast to take my order and the two times I sat at a table there was nobody there.  It took a while for them to get my food.   Once I was finished it took forever both times to get the check.  Then, not only that my biggest pet peeve was hit.  Taking my credit card to run my bill and waiting 15 minutes to get it back.  I feel like I am held hostage when this happens.  The worse thing was I saw my waiter just standing at the end of the table talking to his friends.  Maybe I will just stick to sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for lunch since I started travelling to Charlotte. There is practically a 1:1 ratio of seats to tvs in this place. I have never seen such density of tvs. If you want to watch a game, come here.

However, I  came for the food, and that did not disappoint. I honestly can't remember what I had the first time I  came but the last time, I had the g4illed salmon salad. It was amazing. The salmon was grilled perfectly,  the lettuce was crispy. Very good and a large portion.

We were a large party amd the service was great. Drinks were refilled often and the food came out in a decent amount of  time. Ill definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered the wings which were ok, as they were on the dryer side.  The hand cut fries came out cold and had no flavor. Only good thing about this place is their beer menu and the amount of TVs."}
{"text":"I am giving this 5 stars because of the beer list... the food deserves 4 stars, which is still really good but the beer is the main attraction here. We were in Charlotte for a couple of days and wanted a good food spot near the Discovery Place, with decent prices and something our entire family would love. Duckworth's is literally across the street from the museum. The amount of beer to choose from is a little overwhelming but they give you an iPad to help, plus the staff seemed very knowledgeable about the selections. My husband likes ambers (I think) while I like stouts. WHATEVER kind of beer you like they are sure to have several to choose from. We enjoyed it so much we went back the next day to try more! And if you aren't ready to commit to an entire glass or bottle, you can get a sampler. Tell your waiter/waitress what you like and the bartender will make a sample of a few different beers for you to try. If you find something you really like you can use the iPad to email it to yourself. As for the food, like I said it is good but it's not the draw. I had a burger the first day and boneless wings the next. One thing my husband really liked was that you can have the wings (bone and boneless) finished on the grill giving them a nice char flavor. If you are going to be at the Science Museum downtown and you are kind of a beer snob (that's a good thing!) then definitely walk over to Duckworth's!

Oh, and our kids enjoyed their meals too. We went for lunch one day and an early dinner the next, both times the restaurant was very family friendly!"}
{"text":"TVs on TVs so you can watch the fame from any angle! I watched the Panthers game here yesterday and it was a wonderful experience! Amanda took great care of us! They offer an insane amount of beer on tap! They have an iPad menu but it doesn't offer any ways to narrow down a selection. I think it needs options for \"light beer\" or \"hoppy beer\" instead of just listing them because its quite overwhelming! Overwhelming continues to the food menu as well, its huge! There was a young man, bus boy, who was so friendly and he danced for us! Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Still a 5 STAR establishment!

Came here on a Saturday night to watch my Blackhawks kick the $hit out of Anaheim (yeay!) and I asked the Manager to switch the TV at my booth to the specific channel so that I can watch my game. It took a few minutes (their system is HUGE since they have like 75 TV's in the place, if not more), but he got a few TV's switched to the game I wanted, and apparently there were many other Blackhawks fans and we all rooted for our beloved team!

Not sure if they updated their tablets, but, I always thought you couldn't search by style. Well, my waitress said you can, and I typed in \"Belgian\" (as I love strong Belgian ales) and voila, up popped a large selection of Belgian style beers, both domestic and imported. So Yeay to that!

Now my waitress was very knowledgeable about the beers they have there....and she made some damn killer recommendations, most of which I LOVED! In fact, I walked out with a Growler of my fave beer of the night (don't ask me what it was.....I was hammered at that point but it magically STILL wound up in my Fridge even though I have NO earthly idea how I got home, other than it was UBER - Double YEAY to Uber!). I digress....

I ate before I got here but of course when drinking, you do get the munchies, and I continue to claim that Duckworth's has some of the better \"bar food\" that is available in Charlotte. Got some freshly made chips with Ranch dressing, and that always hits the spot....Not too heavy, and yet satisfying.

So IF you can NOT find a beer you like at this location, you just don't like beer! I gave their massive listing a thorough look this time, and 151 ON TAP and some bottles that are available, and you simply have THE BEST BEER SELECTION IN CHARLOTTE!  IF anyone can find a better selection, PLEASE drop me a note cuz I'd love to go there! 

Bottom line: BEST Beer Selection in Charlotte, better than average bar food, great service and the ultimate sports bar to watch your favorite game. Thus - FIVE STARS!

Continued Great job Rob Duckworth!

PS - July is supposedly when they open up their new \"ultra premium\" beer bar and Foodie kitchen in the downstairs (basement) location. I had the pleasure of taking a tour down there a couple months ago, and man did it look AWESOME! I cannot WAIT to try out this unique concept of a Foodie Kitchen paired with ultra premium beers......WOW!"}
{"text":"Top 3 / Review Summary
1. Televisions galore. I challenge you to find a spot where you can't see a television. Restrooms don't apply to this challenge.
2. Beers galore. A broad selection of ales on tap that would impress the most discerning beer snobs
3. Sports galore. Looking for a specific game, odds are it'll be playing at Duckworths"}
{"text":"See my review on the Cellar at Duckworth's in Uptown.  Very excited about their innovative cocktails and especially their small plate appetizers/food.  

Will have to re-evaluate once I am in with wife for dinner or lunch.  This was just a short visit.

Lots of beers, 110 on tap and you can count on the serving temperature being right as they have three separate and specific temperatured rooms for the kegs.  If you don't want a draft, go for one of the 700 beers in their cellar in bottles.  Quite a variety and worth a tour if they will allow you in.

Entertainment is downstairs in the cellar, most is live and there are a variety of events.

And remember that this is a sports bar and the number of TVs and resulting coverage of sports events is fantastic.  A bit too noisy for me, but it sure is popular.

Lots to eat and drink as well as watch.  Worth more investigation."}
{"text":"The first few times I was here it wasn't that great. Do you know what I did to improve my experience? I complained that I wasn't greeted or asked if I wanted to order... Guess what? They didn't know.. Telling them probably helped!!! I love the place & the sports on TV here!!! The staff & the food & the drinks are awesome!!! If you don't like the way they've treated you... Tell Somebody... Maybe they don't know!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to several Duckworth's locations, but this particular experience was my 1st at the downtown location.  Drunk off an exhilarating Hornets victory and filled with ravenous hunger after a nearly 2 and a half hour drive in traffic from Greensboro, I lustily devoured a plate of buffalo chicken tenders, which couldn't have hit closer to the spot.  Duckworth's is known for their beer selection and the downtown location certainly is no slouch.  Duckworth's has become one of my must stops in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Awesome tap selection, but the praise stops there. Although the bar was fairly empty when we stopped in on a Sunday night, the bartender/server was not attentive at all. She was nice, but we had to flag her down for all of our needs. My husband ordered the fried pickles, which were the MOST SALTY things we have ever eaten. I am actually a big salt fan, but these were way overboard. The texture and dipping sauce would have been enjoyable if we could get past the salt. The restaurant also had a really commercial feel, maybe thats why the staff didn't seem to care. Despite the tap selection and great location, it was a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"This place has a great beer menu! If you're new to Charlotte, this is a great location to try out. Lots of televisions for those looking to watch sports, great menu for someone that wants to eat, and a great beer list for someone looking to try different craft beers. Can't go wrong with Duckworths!"}
{"text":"I ordered food through a third party delivery service, and I know it was slighty late, but nonetheless, they were not closed at all, had plenty of time left before they closed, but lied about not having the items I ordered available because they wanted to shut down their kitchen. As a member of the service industry, it is disappointing and unfortunately, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We had our Goddaughter for a Saturday and (had planned to) end our evening at a restaurant close to Duckworth's for dessert.  Since they were sold out of what we really wanted, we called Duckworth's to place a pick up order for three desserts to go.  We were told it would be just a few minutes, and about 10 mins later we showed up at the hostess stand to get our order.  The girls there acted confused and there was some commotion and it became clear our order was never placed.  No big deal we thought.  How long can if take to put three desserts in a bag?  Answer: 35 mins.  Yes, we were told to head to the bar to pick up our order \"in about four minutes\".  The bartender was friendly, but we kept getting told \"it's coming in just another couple of minutes\".  We had an 11 year old with us and didn't plan to have her in a bar on a Saturday night, let alone for that amount of time to pick up desserts we had phoned in 45 MINUTES earlier.  Keep in mind all three desserts were pre-made and all they had to do was take them out of the fridge and put them in a bag.  And the one dessert that was the assorted cupcakes still had the nutritional info on the plastic box and said \"made by Cheesecake Factory\".  Poor and sloooooow service for absolutely no reason.  By the time we left the bar had half emptied out.  Won't be back.  Just unacceptable service."}
{"text":"Burger in tots were amazing and the drink prices are wonderful. Sunday's evening is the best time to come, make sure you bacon is on the sandwich tho"}
{"text":"Duckworth's in uptown is an awesome place to stop in and have a drink -
 they have a HUGE selection of beers on tap.  With 100+ options, you can certainly find something for everyone.  The bartenders (most of them, at least) are knowledgeable about the beer, and they're happy to let you sample before committing to a full pint.  

The food here is pretty standard bar food.  As long as you don't come in expecting gourmet, you should be able to find a meal that's sure to fit your taste."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for what I thought would be better service - I've had a few bad experiences here. After feeling ignored by the 4 bartenders congregating at the end of the bar who were repeatedly walking by us and not even acknowledging us one instructed another to come take our order. The guy blew his nose with his back to us at the bar, wiping snot from his fingers as he greeted us to take our order.... goodbye Duckworth's"}
{"text":"Thirsten is the best server here! He's fun, personable and knowledgeable. Always recommends different drinks that cater to my taste buds! Come to the bar and check him out!"}
{"text":"Move over Rockbottom, there's a new Sheriff in town and it's Duckworth's.  Had the pleasure of having lunch their for the first (but not my last) time this week.  I ordered the Bacon Chicken Wrap with a side of garlic fries.  The chicken was tender, the bacon crispy....I was in heaven...the fries could've been hotter but they were still to do for....and will definitely make this my new go to place for lunch when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Like going to Duckworths. All the TVs make it great for sports. I really like going on Wed when they have draft beer for $3.50! Good pizza. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and it was Amazing. Great family time! Thank you Lee for excellent service!"}
{"text":"We've been to this place many times, but today they're having issues and it's not that crowed yet! They can't seem to keep the same wait staff and managers. We're not in a hurry and didn't mind waiting, but when you see people standing around.... the waiter at the table across was more attentive than ours. The food was good though."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this restaurant/location! Their bacon cheeseburger and garlic fries are to die for!"}
{"text":"Great, fast service especially considering we had our 3 kids, tired from a full day at Discovery Zone Science. Perfect location and great food. Had sandwiches and pizzas, all were very tasty. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"First time here since my fox and hound closed down.  TVs for days and atleast 100 draft beers.  If u taste one u like they can bottle it and send it with you.  We only had apps but the wings were good, not breaded like most now days.  You can even get them grilled after the fry for 50 cents.  Cool place to chill have a beer and watch the game/fight."}
{"text":"We ordered Philly Cheesesteaks, a few minutes after ordering the waiter said that they were out of the small buns and that we needed to order something else. The manager refused to give us the larger portion at the small portion price note did he allow us to simply put the small portions on the larger bun. Very rude management. On top of everything else they were not serving any mixed drinks. Overall very dissatisfactory experience."}
{"text":"Nice new spot. The renovation adds to this space. Broad beer selection, but where is the OMB? Food is above average bar food."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was great. Beer selection was outstanding! Over 150 beers on tap, how can you go wrong? Our server was Justin and he was outstanding. Make sure to ask for him when you come in. He was intelligent and thoughtful with helping me choose my beer flight and gave me some good advice on some Local brews."}
{"text":"We happened upon this restaurant after a visit to the Levine Museum and were pleasantly surprised. They have a great selection of beers on their menu (over 100?) - tons on draft. They also had a nice menu and good specials ($10 for a large, specialty pizza - nice!). I had the pulled pork sandwich and my husband had the burger special. Both were delicious. The server was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive and staff professional. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We stopped in here as we were exploring uptown, as it looked like a place we could all agree on. I will say their menu has quite the variety of choices, and most importantly their beer list is to die for. Which really is the main thing that sold us to stop by. We loved all of the beers recommended to us, it was neat you could even take a growler home if you found something you really liked! For us we were traveling so that was not an option but if I lived there I would totally join the beer club! I heard several other tables asking for the Steak Salad...I was very intrigued by this but saw it wasn't on the menu and quickly learned the menu was scaled back due to a basketball tournament in town. We still enjoyed our loaded plate of nachos and wings but I would have loved to try some of their other staples that others raved about. Luckily it wasn't packed when we were here so service was quick and friendly! Highly recommend it if you are looking for a tasty cold brew!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon with my boyfriend. I knew it'd be packed, but we were able to get seats at the bar. The bartender greeted us after 3 mins of being there and said he'd be right with us. We waited, waited and waited. He continued to take orders from others at the bar and even new customers that came after us. I went to the bathroom, returned- still no drinks. After 20 minutes we decided to leave. I'm always understand especially if there's a lot of customers and only 3 people behind the bar, but 20 minutes without being serviced is a little ridiculous. Two stars because they do have a lot of tvs and their bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"Who runs out of fries at a bar? Our group stopped in for a late bite on Saturday night and after sitting for a good 20-30 minutes a server appeared.  Another 15 minutes and we finally got our drink order. It looked like one server was covering the entire restaurant & the place was packed. 15 minutes pass and the server returns to advise that the kitchen is out of fries and out of small pizzas. Really? A bar without bar food. 

We spent almost 2 hrs to get crappy sandwiches and missed orders. I think this was a case of an inept kitchen & lousy management screwing the servers. I felt bad for the server and left him a decent tip but we won't be returning to Duckworth's, it's a loser."}
{"text":"Just went to the soft opening tonight and it was amazing. The atmosphere is great, and would be perfect for a date night. The food was great, the filet melted in my mouth, and all I can say is get the s'more for the dessert you will not be disappointed. Large beverage selection. They put a lot of work into this place and you can tell. The staff was exceptional, and I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the issue is with this location.  But it was a depressing and terrible experience.   I was excited to go because my go to spot in Huntersville has been consistently excellent.   We have been going to Huntersville atleast once a week, sometimes two in the football season, therefore, I think I can honestly say, WTF is wrong with downtown?

I get a wait, no problem, but 30 minutes to sit us in the upstairs area?  Really, only one table up there had patrons.   A very loud and drunk 20 something party was going on, combined with the tin ceiling made it impossible to hear my wife sitting across the table from me.    I ask to be reseated and was told I had to wait another hour.  

The first server was new.  Okay I get new, but give the guy a server trainer.  He could not answer any questions about what is on tap.  On top of that, he did not know the menu.   Really?   Okay, we got a second server.  She was beyond stressed.  Running downstairs to the bar to get drinks for the upstairs is just stupid ---- 20 minute wait between drink runs and that is if she bothered to check on us.  No water refills........

The food absolutely sucked.   My Smoakhouse Philly Cheese Steak was a joke.  I added whiz......   The portion was tiny, I could see bun.  The added cheese whiz was a couple drops.   Huntersville - please train them, you guys do it good - with a giant ass sandwich.  For $14.99, I do not want to get Subway portions, you get me?  On top of that, the meat was over cooked, as in dry-carmelized-nastiness.  My wife had her normal pizza supreme, she says that the Huntersville location is the best supreme pizza she has ever had, especially the crust, it has a sweetness to it......   Downtown, way to destroy a pizza with to much grease and soggy crust.

Our friends ordered the Smoked wings and bbq plate.  They said the bbq was awful.   They said that the bbq did not taste fresh, it was soggy like the stuff you get in the grocery store that has sat all day.  They did say the wings were decent.

I am not sure what the problem is.  Huntersville and Mooresville rock it.  To many choices downtown to be let down again.   

Edit - they took the iPads out, now there cheap piece of paper beer menu is just that......a waste of paper."}
{"text":"This is a great alternative to the madness in EpiCentre (which I do like). It's convenient to the 7th St Light Rail stop. It's also a good North Uptown spot when there are Panthers games because you can get a spot while places immediately around BoA Stadium are packed. I haven't tried everything on the menu, but I've never had a meal there I didn't like or love. Great beer selection, but it's their prices that drop them from 5 to 4 stars. I don't believe they pour full pints. They pour 12-14oz drafts. That along with the fact that they need a $1.50 across-the-board cut on their beer prices makes them an every 3rd weekend stop for me instead of an every week place. Their beer selection has something for ALL beer lovers."}
{"text":"Great variety of food and an amazing selection of delicious beer! The servers have been great at each location that I have visited. I especially love the beer flight option so I can try even more great beer. Always a fun place to get a drink or dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered a huge To go order tonight. The lady on the phone said it would take 45 minutes. I got there in 40 minutes and they told me it would be out soon. After waiting sitting there for 25 minutes I was told my entire order is just now beginning to be made. One manager told me they made all the food and then something happened so they had to remake it all again. Another manager told me he had no idea what happened lol. With a 87.5 health score and being disappointed time after time that I go here I had to write this review. There's a sign on the outside of the door that says they are hiring servers but what they really need is a new management staff and a new Chef. Very disappointed with a place that has so much potential with location, menu, and atmosphere. I work in the restaurant industry in Uptown and it's a true embarrassment when I see a place being ran like that."}
{"text":"I went here last night on the hunt for a late night meal and I was impressed! (For those who don't know this location used to be Fox and Hound in Downtown Charlotte) I was warmly greeted and quickly seated. I ordered the veggie fajitas and a Raspberry Lemonade Martini. Both were absolutely delicious. The food portion is plentiful and the prices are very reasonable. Surprisingly this place served a full menu which is awesome considering most places offer a limited menu late at night. If you like to watch sports this is the place to go to there are a ton of televisions. Beautiful restorations have also been completed to this place making it more contemporary. This place is definitely worth a visit if you've never been!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I went back for lunch on a Tuesday to give it another try, and it was better. 

I arrived at 11:30, and the three hostesses at the hostess stand seemed perplexed by what to do when I said, \"Table for 2, please.\" They sort of awkwardly stared at each other, and I wasn't sure which one was going to seat me since they were all whispering to each other. Weird. Finally, one of them took me all the way upstairs and to the very back of the room, even though none of the other tables had anyone at them. 

My friend met me a few minutes later, and things rapidly improved. Our waiter was nice and a little nervous, but he fairly consistently checked on us and refilled our drinks. I got my usual summer salad, which was on point this time, and my friend got the grilled salmon. A manager stopped by the table to check in, which was a nice touch.

By the time we left around 12:30, the place was fairly full. I'll keep giving it chances since I love the other locations."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick downtown bite before a show at McGlohon. Friendly staff, great service, good food."}
{"text":"This was an amazing evening! I loved the atmosphere/vibe of the place. My East Village cocktail was delish as was my husband's smoked old fashioned. Food was out of this world. We shared the duck flatbread and I had the black grouper with the pesto rice and candied carrots and artichokes. My husband had the hanger steak and polenta fries. The steak was cooked to perfection! Words cannot describe how great our waiter, Darren, was. Excellent job all around. Shout out also to the chef that refused to serve our flatbread because he didn't like the way it looked. He made us a different one"}
{"text":"Awesome food and tons of tv with whatever game imaginable on. Awesome beer selection so definitely found out favorite Porter and Stout on tap. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"There were prettttty busy tonight, so we were inform of a 25 minute wait which we were okay with. The staff was nice, the atmosphere is \"sporty\" ya know typical bar with drinks typa place. I feel like they were a little short staffed because a couple were seated across from us but no one even acknowledged them for quite a while so they just left.. Anyways I ordered the shrimp fontina flatbread, it was good but oh man it was SO FRIGGIN OILY!! My friend ordered the tacos & the tortilla chips, I tried some of it, LUV the salsa it tasted really fresh not like the can stuff but lorrrd the tortilla chips were soooo salty like salt was literally falling off the chips lol! I really like how wide their menu is though, maybe I'll stop by one day to try something else.. their food is pretty affordable!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to eat before a Hornets game. My dad and I drive up from Greenville, SC about 10 times a year for games and this has become our go to spot. Huge beer selection and great food and prices. 3.50 draft on almost every beer on tap before a game is great. Pizza is also a fantastic deal on Tuesday and Wednesday nights."}
{"text":"Lack of service/unsanitary. Went to sit at the bar. Was not greeted nor acknowledged by the 4 bartenders standing at the end of the bar, until 10 minutes afterwards. There was one bartender that frequently walked past my friend and I without saying a word. Another bartender had to tell him to come and speak with us. But before he came to speak with us he went to blow his nose directly behind the bar and came straight to us trying to take our order. Mind you he did not wash his hands and while examining his hands in disgust I noticed uncovered cuts and peeled up skin on his hands. Therefore we decided to leave."}
{"text":"Three friends and I went here for lunch during the week.  Two of us ordered blackened tilapia and two ordered salmon.  The tilapia was soooo good.  It came with roasted veggies and island rice.  Everything was seasoned perfectly and delicious.  The two who ordered salmon were pleased also.  However, their salmon was a little under-cooked in the center.  The server said that it's cooked \"medium\".  The manager apologized, cooked it a little longer and ended up taking those off of the bill.  They loved their sides though - sweet, sweet potatoes were fantastic.  You can also order them salty.  We will definitely be back.  Nice change from Rock Bottom which is right across the street."}
{"text":"No consistency for a corporate place. The Ballantyne location seems to have the food together if you have to eat here, but the beer seems to be the only thing going for this place. There are so many other fun bars uptown with great bar food. For $13 you could at least out a little chicken on the salads since you didn't put the cheese on it that the menu clearly said it came with. Step it up guys or uptown will see a new bar Duckworth's financed to have remodeled. One positive note was the sever was doing a great job even for working while pregnant."}
{"text":"Massive beer selection among a sea of TV's. I have been eagerly awaiting Duckworth's to open and had high expectations. We were not disappointed. 

We stopped by Saturday night for dinner and drinks. Wandered over to the bar area, as we waited for our table, and were immediately approached by a server who helped us find a spot to sit, explained their beer menu, and made great recommendations. The place was packed as the Duke v Carolina game was soon to start. Our drinks never went empty; bartenders were quick to notice near empty glasses. You can tell Duckworth's has done this before. They had trainers in bright red shirts assisting staff and ensuring prompt service. 

After a drink at the bar, the pager buzzed and we were escorted to a table upstairs. Much quieter and mellow. Our bar tab was effortlessly transferred to our table. The service upstairs reflected what we had experienced downstairs in the bar. The food was great and came out in about 15 minutes. Most of us had a variety of their cheesesteak and all were happy. I went with the smokehouse philly - steak, jalapeño bacon, BBQ sauce, pepper jack, topped with fried onions. Paired it with garlic fries. My mouth is watering as I type this. 

The basement is opening in early April as The Cellar. According to the staff, it will be a more intimate environment with specialty beer and possibly a mixologist, paired with a more refined farm-to-table menu. Fingers crossed they are open in time for my birthday!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner before a show and was pleasantly pleased! The staff was friendly and the service was prompt! My daughter and I had the Ceasar wrap and blackened chicken bacon wrap which was just what we were looking for My Honey had the steak and egg philly with garlic fries and both were beyond awesome!!! We will most definitely come back to try more off the menu since there are so many different options that sound yummy?"}
{"text":"I've been monitoring this page since my friend got food poisoining here. All of the bad yelp reviews are removed within a few days, so sketchy!"}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. They almost have too many great things to choose from - ALMOST. My favorite dish is their meatza pizza. Great fresh tasting ingredients on an amazing crust. Fun atmosphere if you like a bar feel. Great location in uptown. Definitely a place to check off your list to try! Oh, and please try their potato skins - they are A-mazing!"}
{"text":"Very unprofessional place. Came in and was never greeted so I went to the bar area, but it was too crowded so I went back to the front and the host just looked at me and asked if I needed anything. Maybe she lacks common sense. Fast forward to the service I got, my server was nice but my food tasted like it was just reheated, brought it to managements attention and he didn't seem to care. He was kind of talking down to me in a way, made me feel very uncomfortable. Then after that whole thing I look over as I'm getting ready to leave and I see him and another female which may have been a manager, I see them looking over at me and him waving his hands around while he was obviously talking about me. On my way out I got his name from the host. His name was Cory and apparently he is an assistant manager. Well maybe he needs to find a job as a high school teacher because he shouldn't be talking to adults like that."}
{"text":"So far I've been waiting for a drink ummmmmm about thirty minutes. As most dine in folks, I started looking at the menu. Waiter comes back to check appetizer order to confirm it was what he actually entered and was it correct. I'm glad he actually entered it correctly or we would have to wait longer for a drink and new appetizer.  Well ya know what, I think we will just leave - what's the point!!!!! BYE!!!!!!!!! #poorcustomerservice"}
{"text":"The place works for watching football on a rainy Sunday. TVs everywhere!  Beer selection is insane. 4 pages of tiny print listing all beers. Decent specials daily. Food is good but not great. Service is good but a little slow. Have the Momoos wings for sure."}
{"text":"What keeps me coming back? The beer selection, their wings... and Football Sundays! I have to say the seating situation is a bit tough on Sundays, so if you want to get a good seat, come before noon (ie: before they start serving booze). 

The first time I came with some friends and the 1PM games were on... someone cheered and I didn't know what TV to watch... it's definitely a sensory overload when the Panthers are playing. However, if your team is playing the 1PM games and the Panthers are not playing, you'll be able to watch the games in relative peace."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience with one of the servers/bartenders. We stopped in real quick because we were on the trolley pub, and one of my friends did not finish her beer yet and was running to the restroom before we had to leave. The server grabbed the beer out of her hand and slammed it on the table telling her she wasn't allowed alcohol in the bathroom..understandable. My friend was in shock that someone would actually do that and let it go. While waiting for another friend to finish in the bathroom, the server walked over to us to tell us she was not losing her job, and went so far as to swear at us (no one was even saying a word back to her). By this point no one even had alcohol in their hand and we were already on our way out the door. The rest of the staff was very friendly, but after the way she treated us, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had lunch at the Uptown location and it was really good.  The lunch special was the $7.99 cheeseburger meal which comes with a drink... and its a double cheeseburger... big!  But the best part was our server. He did a really great job, regularly checked on us, made sure we had to-go cups before we left and the manager stopped by the table which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Damn. There are not enough TVs at this place. Yeah right! I've never been to a sports bar with more TVs than this place. They have more TVs than Beat Buy. Went there for the National Championship game and Carolina won so the place was rocking!! I had the Sweet and Gold wings, very good and the Double Decker Strawberry Short Cake. The service was great too."}
{"text":"Can't stand being rushed and this place is all rush, rush , rush.  I ordered a beer and asked for time to drink the beer and then we would order.  By the time I had drank less than 1/10th of my brew I had been asked 4 times if I was ready to order. No...I want to drink my beer...

I like to drink a few beers and then order so I can enjoy the extensive craft beer selection they have.  But each time I come here I'm rushed to get my drink, order, and get out.  Granted, the 1st time I came here it was busy, but this time half the bar was open.  So, that means they just want me to eat and leave.  

A shame , I love the Duckworth's on Park Road. Never feel that rushed.  I mainly come for the craft beer and having to down the brew without the opportunity to enjoy makes this location little more than a McDonald's in my humble opinion.

~5 for craft beer selection
~5 for food and location
~1 for Stress factor and \"Service\"

~2 overall for total lack of enjoyment. Yay Duckworth's

P.S. the beer they delivered was obviously the wrong brew.  We ordered a Double IPA and it was clearly a Belgian.  When we asked the Bartender to verify he shrugged and said that's what came out of the tap...laughable. Only reason I came was for brew and I can't even trust what I get when
 I order here."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for the typical guy things like brick walls, lots of tvs and lots of beer. Duckworths takes it to all new heights though. Well over 100 beers on tap - Ipad menus - jam packed rows of flat screens. For some it can be a bit overwhelming and others a feast for the senses. I was also impressed with the amount of natural light in the main bar; it's nice to be able to see who you're talking with. 

The beer list is well selected. I enjoyed a Tropical IPA from the Sierra Nevada Beer Camp series that had all three of my favorite hops in it. Our waiter was friendly, brought beer samples and didn't pout when we just ordered drinks. I don't even mind the \"we card everyone policy\". I have yet to eat at Duckworth's (the main dining area) but it's definitely on my \"to do\" list. If it's anything like the food they serve in the Cellar portion, I'm certain it's good. As for the rest, I could sit and drink here all day long without running out of choices."}
{"text":"We went to Duckworth's for a later meal and some drinks. When we walked in, it took a while to be acknowledged and seated. When we were given the drink list, it was on an iPad and all 60 drinks ran together on the list. It was overwhelming trying to find something new on an iPad. We ordered an app of fried pickles. I will give them a 2 out of 5. I may just have higher standards for fried pickles but for me they were way too salty and didn't look very appetizing when it came out. I ordered a philly cheese for my meal and it tasted like it was heated up from a package. 2/5 for the Philly. My wife got the ribs and they seemed the same. They had a funky texture and tasted as though it came out of the same microwave. She ate half of the rack and didn't want to even think about taking the rest home. It was disappointing because I was really looking forward to going to this location since we had been to the one on Montford and we had a good experience."}
{"text":"Beer Ipads.....BEER IPADS.  That is genius first off.  Secondly, if you know the other locations then you know the food is pretty solid.  I just appreciate the fact that they are consistent with their food.

The service is sometimes hit or miss but sometimes I don't like doing my job either :).  Truthfully there are only two reasons I come here.  One, the beer selection.  Full of styles and varieties for everyone.  Secondly is the TV's.  Probably the best place to catch a game in Charlotte.

This location really stands out from all the others."}
{"text":"The food always comes out wrong! No matter if you are dining in or taking out, they consistently mess something up on your order, forget something in your order or make it differently than the menu says."}
{"text":"Walk by this place 5 days a week since November 11th. Today, January 1st, was the first time I went in and had a burger, I ordered the APPLEWOOD SMOKED BACON CHEESEBURGER, with a side of fries and coleslaw...and a sweetened ice tea.

If you LIKE watching TV, you would have thought you died and went to Heaven. TV's ALL over the place..can you say..'sensory overload' boys & girls. Took some getting use to, just focus on a Poker Game going on on one TV was all I could handle.

Walked in and waited less than 2 minutes to be seated. The host actually asked me, which I am surprised..asked have I been waiting long. Nice of her. Can't remember my waiter's name, but he was training 'The New Guy'. Been there and done that. He made me feel comfortable and the person he was training also.

I didn't timed how long it took for my food to arrive, but my waiter told me that it wouldn't be long, and it wasn't. First thing I tried was the coleslaw. Not sweet, you could actually taste everything in it, nothing overpowering at all..NICE. The fries were the biggest plate of fries I have ever seen for 'lil bit ol me.' I think 2, 3 forkfuls and I knew it was going out the door with me. The Burger... First of all ANYTHING WITH BACON ON IT...you can't go wrong, is what I say. What I LIKE MOST about this burger..the shape. To apply ketchup and salt, you actually have to deconstruct it. Upon doing this, I notice that who ever cooked it made sure that it was at the proper temp. I say this because the burger was in 2 pieces. From my experience being on a grill, I always make sure that it's at the right temp by going inside of it, and the only way to do that is to 'break it' so that you can get a reading. I was surprised by the mayo, or whatever that white creamy stuff was..because I was already 3/4's thru the burger and BAM, there it was. In my book, that is just GREAT! Every bite had all the ingredients, a way a burger is suppose to be put together.

You know how you wish you can have a place that serves excellent food RIGHT across the street from where you live... Duckworth's IS that place."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and decided to visit this place. My first impression was that the bar area looked fun. They had many TVs and a huge selection of beer. HOWEVER, they are WAY overpriced. One champagne cocktail drink cost $9 and came in a champagne flute...tiny. I was going to order their margarita, but it was $12 and I was scared to get something tiny for the price, so I didn't. 

Then the bartender told us about the growler and pizza special that they had and that it is the best special in town. The special was two growlers and two (two topping) pizzas for $25. We ordered that. Our bill came out and it was $40. When we asked the bartender what happened to the $25 special, he told \"read the small print, it is $5 extra for each growler.\" There was some other unexpected charge on there as well, however, I cannot remember what it was exactly. I told the bartender that they cannot possibly expect people to pay attention to the \"small print\" when they are at the bar drinking. 

The reason why this place is getting 4 stars is because once the manager noticed the commotion, he promptly stepped up and comped our bill. We promptly tipped the bartender $10 in return, so the outcome was good.

The pizza was amazing.

I will definitely go there again, but I will be careful about what I order."}
{"text":"I stopped here on the Carolina panther's first preseason game.  The specials were amazing and my server was fantastic!  The drafts were 3.50 and I ordered the pepperoni pizza special.  The pizza was delicious, the beer was good, and I could view the game on several televisions throughout the establishment.  Great place to hang out and watch games!"}
{"text":"We decided to go here during the Taste of Charlotte festival. My daughter had a cheese pizza kids meal which looked fantastic. She enjoyed it too because she ate it and it's a pretty decent size pizza for a kids meal. Probably the same size as the small in the regular menu. 

I had an appetizer, the chicken tenders with fries. The chicken tenders were pretty good, I had them cooked in BBQ sauce. The fries were hot when served but they were ok. I didn't really eat them because I didn't care for them much. 

My mom had a Caesar salad and it was tasty and fresh for her. 

Our waitress was friendly and prompt. She made sure she kept refilling our drinks regularly before they got empty, which was pretty good since we kept drinking them quickly. We were very thirsty since it was around 95 degrees outside. The only reason I'm not giving a 5 was because of the fries. I'm just picky about them."}
{"text":"My cousin introduced me to Duckworth's when the Uptown location opened. From then until now, they never disappoint. I love the Smokehouse Philly and garlic fries. The full-size sandwich is loaded and enough for two meals. Their staff is friendly, professional and great at what they do. Keep up the great service!"}
{"text":"Duckworth's saved our Tuesday!
My friends and I headed over to Duckworth's after leaving another restaurant with a pricey menu and crappy service. We sat in the bar area, and our server (wish I could remember his name) showed up with great energy, and great knowledge about the menu. Oh... DRINK SPECIALS! The garlic fries are sooooooo good. The chorizo burger is my newest guilty pleasure. If you're looking for good food, a full menu of spirits, and great service at fair prices, skip the Snooty von Snoots nearby and head on over to Duckworth's."}
{"text":"Stopped in to meet up with friends and enjoy some football on the TV. The place was packed but after a brief wait a table opened up and all of the seats at our table had a view of at least one television tuned into the game.

Duckworth's has the right snacks for watching the game. We had a chicken quesadilla, some boneless wings (two flavors) and a plate of the chicken nachos. The quesadilla and the wings split up nicely but the plate of nachos was insanely huge. A LOT of chips, cheese and chicken on this monster platter. Excavating around the edges worked well because the chicken and \"stuff\" was more inside than on top.

Where Duckworth's wins is their amazingly organized beer list. Sure, some places print stuff out. But no, not this spot. They have iPads for the table that list their beers, provide descriptions and prices. So if you're looking for something different that perhaps you've never had before, this is the spot.

We enjoyed our time. Decent service and way lots of televisions."}
{"text":"Love this place! The is my go-to uptown. The food is awesome and the place is always clean. Never a bad experience."}
{"text":"Pretty cool bar. The beer menu was an iPad which was pretty cool. You can sort it by type and you can click on each beer to get a description.  They have a huge beer selection. The bartenders were nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I attended Duckworths uptown soft opening and had a great time! Building looks great and the atmosphere is pleasant. There has to be at least 100 TVs here,  which is great for me because I love sports.  Food was great, and the menu looks pretty good. Try the fajitas! They also have a massive beer list, with an iPad  tailored to help you find your beer of choice.  I will definitely  recommend to friends."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our traditional yummy Sunday lunch across from St. Peter's Church.  I order the famous cheesesteak supreme with grilled vegetables, kids got the kids cheese burger, and the spouse got the go to usual mommoo's wings."}
{"text":"What's up with the floor being so slippery anywho came here for lunch service was fast and good the food was excellent and best of all the server gave me a good beer to drink (I'm from out of town and asked for a local beer) awesome place!"}
{"text":"Went to this location for lunch with 4 other coworkers. Was seated in the corner booth located right next to the kitchen. Waitress was not friendly and seemed like she wanted zero social contact. Not too busy even though it was during lunch time. She took our drink orders and never came back to refill our drinks even though she had to walk right past our table to deliver food to others. We had to specifically ask multiple times for refills. Buffalo chicken sandwich was the most basic of sandwiches and had next to no sauce on it. No lettuce or tomato was on the sandwich. For those who got tator tots, they received a small handful, nothing that a \"side\" would justify. 

I order the large steak and egg philly with no onions. The amount of meat on it was the exact same as the regular version, bearing no difference except for the amount of bread. It also had onions on it after specifically requesting no onions. Had to ask multiple times for other sauces since all orders lacked any resemblance of being appetizing. No where close to being worth a $15 meal. Extremely disappointed and do not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This place used to be ok.. but it has systemic issues. All bartenders look down, don't have heads up, are obsessed with service bar, cleaning glasses over getting patrons beers etc. mgmt also fails with not being able to control their zillions of Tvs. Once again- people that don't know that the only reason they have jobs is because of customers. Figure it out people..."}
{"text":"This place probably deserves a five!
I'd taken my little ones to the Imageon and we were looking for a no-frills dining option near by. What an awesome place!
The portions are huge, lots of awesome beer on tap (over 100+)! Great menu, too! Tons of TVs, decent music and a great location! It's clean as well! There are defined sections featuring a dining area (still has lots of TVs,) a taproom and some other sections I didn't venture into.
The caprese salad was better than what I expected. The balsamic vinegarette was a nice touch.
The kids had the hotdog, which they loved (I enjoyed a bite or two as well.) 
The brisket tacos were very flavorful and more filling than you'd think.
Their best item had to be the wings. I decided to partake in the lemon pepper, which were plump, crisp and very flavorful. My favorite thing was the Bold and Gold wings. They use a South Carolina specialty, a mustard-based BBQ sauce that makes everything better! If eat it on ice cream if it were on the menu! The bold, tangy flavor makes my mouth water just thinking about it! Who doesn't love Carolina sauce? Maybe Al Quaeda or the Communists.
Of course any hope of a healthy eating day was dashed so we had to order dessert. The cupcake sampler was a big hit with the family. I had to get the strawberry shortcake cheesecake. Yes, it is a real thing and yes it is even better than you thought possible! 
In short, if you want a stellar meal, eat here. They have five locations in the Charlotte area. Unfortunately not yet in SC. If you want lame bland food, hit the chain across the street!"}
{"text":"Great place for sandwiches and beer.  Huge selection of beer.  They use to have beer menu on tablets but had to go back to paper because customers walking out the door with them, a shame."}
{"text":"First time in Charlotte and while walking around we decided to stop in for a drink.  Well, needless to stay we stayed for dinner and were extremely impressed.  The barmaid was so friendly and made quality drinks.  They had a very good wine list.  So after a few we decided to check out the Cellar.  What an interesting place.  So comfortable and the food was DELICIOUS.  The filet mignon was the most tender we'd ever had.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu. She was very friendly and professional.  We would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"Husband and I grabbed a bite for dinner here after checking out the Sip n Shop at 7th Street Market. It was both of our first times here, and we were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess and taken to a table. 

Atmosphere is very casual with TONS of flat screen TVs. The bar is SUPER impressive with 100+ taps -- yes please. Husband ordered the Fajita Salad with chicken. It disappeared in 5 minutes, so I'm pretty sure he was happy with his choice. I went with the Twisted Chicken sandwich and a baked potato (extra .99). It was HUGE and and a little on the salty side but I'd order again. 

Our waitress Joselyn was fantastic!!! We will be back. :)"}
{"text":"Perfect spot to watch the big game! Service can be hit or miss. Food is slightly above average for bar grub. But, the beer selection and amount of TVs in the bar area just can't be rivaled! 

We prefer sitting in the bar. Stools are first come, first served and even on the busiest nights, we can usually wedge ourselves into a spot within 5-10 minutes of arriving. From any seat in the bar, you can see no less than 10 TVs. Swivel your head just a bit and TV viewage increases to 20. The crowd here is usually fun and lively, too. You can almost always find someone cheering on your team."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try out Duckworths! My boyfriend has been here before and he loved it, said they have awesome wings! So when myself and a few coworkers were planning a lunch on Saturday I suggested Duckworths....we were not too pleased. 

Overall, the food was just average. I got the summer salad. It was first brought to me without any dressing so I had to ask for it. Once I added it to my salad, I wish I hadn't. It was too oily and kind of ruined the \"summery\" taste. And they also forgot to put the Gorgonzola cheese on it, bummer. My friends burger was good, but she asked for sweet potato fries sweet sweet and they weren't brought out that way. So she asked for new ones and they did bring out another order but they looked the same. Another friend got the blue cheese chips which weren't terrible but thy were drowning in blue cheese with no where near enough chips. Once the chips were gone, there was almost a full bowl of clue cheese. So needless to say, we weren't too impressed with the food. Maybe we just ordered non popular items. 

The service was odd....our waiter was super awkward and every time he came over it felt like he was waiting for us to initiate the conversation. I've been a server for a long time and that's definitely not the most effective way to get the attention of your tables! After one of our friends left and asked for her check early, he brought it but never came back for the rest of us. It had been about 45 minutes before we had to flag him down for our checks, which was okay because we were talking but in any other situation, way too long to wait for a check. Service was mediocre at best, especially since it wasn't even busy! 

The atmosphere was great! Tons of tvs, decorated really nicely, and beer taps everywhere which was cool. It was a fun environment and definitely a good place to watch the game or go have a few beers at the bar. I'll probably try Duckworths out again just because I've heard so many good things and their menu is huge so I'd like to test some other items out."}
{"text":"Maybe it is because I'm getting old, but you can usually find my butt parked up at a bar when I'm not working.  The exploding craft beer scene is pretty awesome for beer fans, but places like Duckworth's pretty much make it easy to try new beers from everywhere with their selection.

This spot Uptown opened a couple months ago - sadly it took the spot of one of my \"go-tos\" when I was a lot younger:  Fox and Hound.  But it's probably for the best.  They pretty much gutted the building and have a fresh bar, dining area, and tons of TVs everywhere.

Staff are friendly and it makes for a great place to meet friends, watch sports, and drink beer!   iPad beer menus make it nice and interactive... and less pressure for the servers to know everything about all the beers they serve.  Either way, it's a solid option for after work drinking, lunch, weekends, and meeting up for dinner/drinks."}
{"text":"This was the absolute worst bar experience in the legal years I've been drinking. (13 yrs) So my friend was kidding around while ordering and said she was drunk which lead to our server, Carly, to not serve my friend! Complete craziness because my friend had had one drink at that point! I order a drink and apparently was watched the whole time as I gave her a small amount of the drink. We were told we could not be served anymore! I've never felt so uncomfortable in my life! Neither of us was intoxicated! Don't go here unless you want to be babysitted!"}
{"text":"Randi was very helpful in helping choose a beer and letting us try samples. I had the jalapeño draft, can't remember the exact name, but it was great, something different! I also recommend the chorizo burger.. it was delicious, and the burger bun was amazing! My first time here, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great sports bar. Good vibe. Clean and brightly lit. No shortage of TVs and the quality of the picture was great. Came for the Georgia/Alabama game with a group of over 25 coaches and athletes and had a great experience. Service was excellent even though it was an extremely busy night. Fantastic variety of beer, wine and full bar. Food was your typical sports bar food. Would definitely come back to watch a game the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Well, I tried to eat here.  After 15 minutes plus of waiting, we were ignored completely.  My sister asked one server if we could get assistance and we were told someone would be with us shortly.  Another ten minutes and nothing.  The bartender walked near our table and my sister tried to engage him in conversation, but he too looked right through her as if she wasn't there.  It did look as if we had walked in after a big rush because there were uncleared tables everywhere, but the blatant lack of attention is completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection! Two rows of taps was enough to impress me! I would really give this place a 3.5. The BBQ sandwich was pretty tasty with the cinnamon glazed sweet potato fries! Friend got wings which looked pretty good but I'm nervous to try any wings as I'm a buffalo girl and am pretty picky. No offense to the restaurant but no one can make wings like buffalo! Waiter said the nc BBQ sauce was the sc sauce and I always thought it was the other way around so kinda confused but I got what I wanted-the vinegar one so I was pleased!"}
{"text":"Our server Justin is the bomb!! Great recommendations on food and awesome drinks late night. Very welcoming coming from Vegas. :)"}
{"text":"I had Gabby as my server and she was wonderful!! This is a great place to watch sports games. They have a large variety of beers to choose from ( almost 4 pages). I got the Margherita flat bread but I wasn't a big fan so I got the philly cheese steak instead which is what they're known for! It was delicious."}
{"text":"When we go into the city of charlotte, we always stop by Duckworths for lunch and for the beer selection. We're never disappointed!  Becca is always friendly and helpful. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've never been to a Duckworth's before, but it was late, it was open, and they had food. The ambiance is nice, although the walls of TVs seemed a little over the top. The iPad for the beer list was kind of amazing, as, evidently, was the beer list itself. I'm not much of a beer guy, but evidently their tap room was a connoisseur's dream.

The food was okay, nothing too great. The sweet-and-bold wing sauce was decent, but I'm not sure if it should be a best-of-Charlotte winner. The pulled pork was dry and didn't have as much flavor as I would have expected. I had to drench it in barbecue sauce in order to get it chewable. Their coleslaw was the highlight of the evening - I could have taken a couple of pounds of that home with me and eaten it all night. The menu itself was comprehensive, but it could stand an iPad or some better organization. It was tough to find what I wanted, especially with each page having different side items that wound up being specific to the page.

The service? Holy crap. The service would make the Baby Jesus cry. Our server, Lex, is the slowest human being on the face of the earth. She has the attention span of an ADHD puppy and the trundle speed of a very dizzy baby turtle. It took one of my dinner companions more than thirty minutes to get a beer and it took me an hour to get my food. Well, most of my food. She forgot two different things and had to go back and, I'm assuming, got lost navigating the Maze of Trials that leads to the kitchen and back. We asked about a specific beer on the list, only to receive \"I haven't really bothered to learn about beers. I'm not sure how long I'm going to be working here anyway\" as our response. What the shit, Lana. After we kept asking her to refill our drinks (a process that took ~15 minutes each time), she really let her ghetto come out, giving me an attitude that was worthy of Medea.

All in all, they put effort into this place, which was nice. I might try it again when I'm back in Charlotte, but I'm going to try my best to avoid Medea's younger sister if I do come back. Food? Decent. Service? Absolutely worthless."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, just dont order the BBQ...  Service could definitely use improvement.  Call ahead take out should not take 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place and my first experience did not even come close. The poor service and extremely slow ticket time should not be something you see on a weekend. The food was poorly cooked, i.e. Over salted and poorly made. I definitely would not recommend."}
{"text":"Duckworth's gets five stars for the beer list it is phenomenal and really easy to navigate on an iPad menu. There is a wide selection of beers both local and from across the country. Perfect for any of your let Duckworth's gets five stars for the beer list it is phenomenal and really easy to navigate on an iPad mini. There is a wide selection of beers both local and from across the country. Perfect for any beer lover. 

 Food on the other hand is average to above average. It's not the best part that I've ever had but it's by no means the worst. We had the Carolina pulled pork sandwich and it was OK. I will say the wings were pretty good. They were crunchy and spicy in the best way possible, but info prefer a crunchier wing. 

 All in all I would recommend checking the place out the beer menu is by far worth it and the food is decent."}
{"text":"SO MANY TV'S! If you need a place to watch the game.... a game, any game. Literally any sport you could imagine, you can catch it here. Tried to get a table in the main restaurant area, don't bother there was a 30 min wait and the bar is first come first serve so just belly-up to the bar and make friends. The atmosphere is fun, the food is way above \"bar food\" status. Also, BEER. So much beer, so many to choose from and of course they have an awesome sampler deal where you can choose 4 beers you want to try and they bring them out on this little paddle in small glasses. Their cocktail selection was also on point. I got the Melon Ball and it is definitely an acquired taste but I LOVED it.  My burger was a little over done but the toppings were so fresh and the cheese and sauce was so good I hardly noticed after a couple bites. The Buffalo chips were amazing but I wish they put chicken on them, they would be my fav thing on the menu! Will definitely be going back soon. PS it's right across the street from Discovery Place so if y'all do the Science on the Rocks 21+ boozy night at the museum, Duckworth is a perfect stop afterwards."}
{"text":"As a big beer fan, this place is great! Their extensive beer selection reminds me of World of Beer but with food options as well. Make sure to get a beer card if you plan to frequent!

The atmosphere is casual. It's great for grabbing drinks before a Hornets game or to watch your favorite sports team. The location is great too for bar hopping as it's close to a ton of other places Uptown.

When I went I opted to sit at the bar with a friend for a couple drinks as we waited for our table at Cellar at Duckworth's. Our waiter was very patient with us as it took as awhile to read through all the options. He was helpful in narrowing down a few choices. 

I will definitely be back as their menu as plenty of options for a big group of people. I'm most interested in trying their Philly Cheesesteak. I haven't seen too many places in Charlotte with this food item on their menu."}
{"text":"Cool place, lots of TVs. Went for lunch so I don't think I got the full effect like watching a game there or having dinner Uptown. Overwhelming is one word I would use to describe this place though. Both the beer list and menu were so large it was almost stressful to decide. When our server came to take our order I just spouted something out that wasn't even one of my top contenders. I had the fish tacos and would not get again. There was too much fish on them, I know thats not something people normally complain about but they were hard to eat. I also didn't like all of the pineapple and mango in the salsas. I should have went with the buffalo chicken philly. I will definitely go back to try! We started with the fried banana pepper rings which were really good and my brother really liked his cobb salad. Will go back, just order differently!"}
{"text":"Good location and we had no trouble finding a spot at the bar. TVs are everywhere. Service is good. I love the decor at this restaurant. It's updated and has a rustic feel. The bar area is very nice. Food was also pleasant so no complaints here!"}
{"text":"I visited this bar for the 1st time on 3/6/17 with my daughter before heading to the Hornets game. The service was horrible, the waitress didn't offer any additional drinks although she walked past our table to her next table & offered them a refill. The manager asked the same table how things were & she walked right past my table without looking or asking how was the service. There was a party of 8 sitting to the right of us & not once did I hear or see the waitress ask for any ID's when they ordered alcohol. I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone because of the poor service I received. The food was good but that was about it."}
{"text":"My server was Kaitlin, she was absolutely awesome. Very attentive and the food was great. Will definitely be coming back soon and asking for this server!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Friday afternoon lunch, immediately greeted by a friendly host and sat in a nice booth by the window. Waiter came to table quickly to get drink order and we already knew what we wanted so took that after bringing our drinks. He was super nice and our food came out pretty quickly. We both ordered the lunch special of a bbq sandwich and home cut chips. The chips were perfect and went great with the ranch which you could tell was homemade. I love eastern style bbq so the sandwich was perfect and went really well with the homemade coleslaw that was served on the side. He brought us bbq sauce on the side as well and I normally don't like bbq sauce but this one was really good. I would love to come back here and try more things on their menu and also maybe for dinner to try some of their craft beers."}
{"text":"Sensory overload, but in the best way possible. This place is plastered with TVs and has a beer list a mile long. Seriously, if you can't find a beer here you want, well then the problem is you.

The beer menu is on an ipad. You can even search keywords. This makes my quest to drink #allthepumpkin beers much easier. I'm a huge fan of Duckworth's philly cheesesteaks and pizza. I should probably branch out and try other things, but I just can't seem to quit you buffalo chicken philly. 

This place is perfect for football, basketball, baseball, and any other fill-in-the-blank sport. We spent four hours here Saturday with a group of seven people. Seven people who all had parlays. What does that mean? Well, they were able to watch all 42384729837948273 games they needed to see. When the 3:30 games ended, they even changed four TVs for us. Don't worry, we all made sure that no one was watching those screens.

Service has been kind of hit or miss for me. Saturday our service was fantastic. We watched the Cubs wildcard game here a few weeks ago and it was a cluster. I felt bad for everyone working there because it was obvious they weren't prepared for the crowd. 

This location has different menu specials each day. Looking for late night food? They serve their entire menu until 2am."}
{"text":"I didn't eat here, but they have like 120 beers on tap, and yes that's as great as it sounds."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I enjoy the food, but the experience isn't ideal.

Good side: food is good (minus the salad), great beer selection (150 beers on tap, you can't beat that), food selection is good too.

Bad side: service can be really slow. I get it if it's a busy time, but I've been in at a later time and it was still slow. I'd say they're understaffed. the salads aren't cut and it's really annoying.

If you're here for lunch with work friends, you can expect to be there for at least an hour. Unless you want scarf down the food in minutes, you're not going to get out under an hour.

If you have patience, I'd definitely recommend the place. If not, better check somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very delicious cheese steak, wish it came with more fries. Could use more staff, always feels a bit under staffed."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar but was distracted by the gay pride parade going on in the street. There are many glass windows in the restaurant so I couldn't help but to watch. The bartender was great and very prompt. The food was good. I had the veggie burger and sweet potato fries along with the cupcake sampler. The veggie burger could have been cooked a little more. But other than that, there was a big crowd when we got here at 5 but gradually got even bigger by 6:45. The beer samples were also pretty good. I had the sugar creek raspberry white ale (tasted good ... like popcorn) and the trophy wife (tasted good like pink grapefruit) but saved some till after dinner and should not have done that bec now it tastes like regular beer. Overall very satisfied m.!"}
{"text":"Bartender only paid attention to her friends in the bar area waited over 10 minutes for a cup of water.  We ordered food and we never received any silver ware. We ordered the mozzarella sticks and potato skins food took a while to come out. At the time we were the only customers eating food. 20 plus mins for appetizers is excessive when you only have 6 people in your restaurant. The poor food runner took care of us and made sure we had app plates and silverware. This is my second time trying this location and again during a slow time period and the service was horrible. The manager walked by us twice and didn't acknowledge the fact that we didn't have silverware to eat our food he glanced at us and continued to walk past. We enjoy the location off park road but will not be back for another horrible experience at the uptown location."}
{"text":"I'm just going to keep this nice and simple. The food was ok and the service sucks. If your server is Casey just get up and walk out. He has no personality and no smile. If you are having a good vibe when you walk in he will just kill it for you. I suggest you go to the ballantyne location for a better experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here a few times for drinks while visiting Charlotte for an extended weekend. The environment was nice and welcoming. The food was alright. There was a very large variety of drinks with multiple tvs at the bar. But the biggest reason why we kept coming back was the awesome bartender that was there!!! I really wish I could remember his name, but I kept forgetting it. I do know that he was originally from Minnesota. He was super friendly and just made us want to post up there all night! He was honest and funny and helpful with picking delicious beverages. They have so many different beers on tap, so it was nice being able to sample a little something that was recommended before ordering a full glass. Very glad we stumbled upon this place and we know that if we lived in town, we would easily become regulars here!"}
{"text":"Rhett, Steve, and Mike made sure my friend and I had a great time and we were never waiting for anything. The staff was amazing and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"With a grill and Taphouse, I feel the need to review both menus. First the drinks: the drink menu is a separate menu from the main, physical menu and it displays on a iPad. I have two main issues with this, this the 3 star rating. The first issue is that I do not want to be touching a device everyone else has been using. I fully understand that everything can be cleaned just the same way as a menu can, but with the main menu being physical and the drink menu being virtual, it was already awkward to transition back and forth anyways to get a good pairing. My second issue with the menu is that it did not update to match current day prices for specials. I feel like that is part of the convenience of having a iPad in the first place, but not accurately reporting prices just seemed weird. The drinks are also a bit expensive, which I thought was odd considering the location.
The food menu, on the other hand, was really solid. A good selection from flatbreads to burgers gave a bit of local flair to the menu, though I didn't see anything that struck me as particularly original or creative. Not saying every place has to be, it's just a nice touch to me. Overall, good place to try, but I personally won't return."}
{"text":"I recommend Duckworths to everyone.  I've not had a bad meal at one yet.  I am sad that they removed the Brisket Tacos from the menu (The menu was too big, but those were my go to recommendation, and I always got a thanks for the recommendation), but I still love duckworths."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection. Our server was really nice, but we never really got to see him. His section was too big and we really felt ignored. Maybe some better staffing would make this spot more enjoyable."}
{"text":"If you are a sports lover this is your spot tva in every direction and always a good crowd. The layout is a bit cluttered but this is a good place for groups or just a spot to grab a brew. I haven't had any food other than basic apps which were decent. However the drinks are good with a good selection of beers and a digital beer menu to help you narrow down your vice. Cheers."}
{"text":"Duckworth's may be my new favorite place to watch sports. There are about 100 televisions, so there is no seat that will leave you with a bad view. The hostess was friendly and attentive when I walked in looking for a friend. We sat at the bar. The entire menu, which is on an iPad because they are fancy and environmentally friendly, is expansive. I knew I wanted only an appetizer, so I didn't bother checking out the other options. You can find it online if you're interested. I ordered the potato skins. They were typical skins with cheese and bacon. There were only 4 pieces. I expected 6.

My friend who ordered bacon cheese fries w/ jalapeño bacon and the nightly special wings that had 17 spices actually did not love the wings. I had some and thought they were pretty good. Still average. Nothing to write home about. All food was served hot out of the oven/stove, which is nice. Better to be too hot than too cold. Tuesdays are 1/2 price wine bottle night. They also have beer specials ($3.50). While I'm not a beer drinker, the number of options on tap are the most I've seen in Charlotte. The spread is rather picturesque. I'll take a picture next time I go.

The waitress couldn't have done a better job. She was there when we needed her and gone otherwise, which is perfect for a sports bar. The sound wasn't too loud, as I was able to talk to my friend while we were watching the game. Overall, this is a great sports bar with great service. Average food, but above and beyond when it comes to what makes a sports bar, the SPORTS and the BAR."}
{"text":"If you are a sports fan then this is the bar for you, 2 words Televisions Everywhere! I have been to a couple of the area Duckworth's and this one has more TVs than anywhere else. I have been during lunch, dinner, and for late night drinks and each time the service was great and I was seated quickly. There are a ton of beers on tap, which are presented to you on an iPad with info on each beer to help you make the selection, and they have a beer club you can join. 

As far as the food goes, the menu has a wide variety of options and everything I have tried has been perfection. Some of my favorites are their wings (I would suggest the Sweet n' Bold Gold), the steak & egg philly, and of course fries boardwalk style. 

With this new location uptown, I know I will continue to frequent Duckworth's; I'm craving the french fries already."}
{"text":"So it took 90 min to get our order of boneless chicken bites... Was told the closing shift isn't as good. Therefore management needs to get their employees in line or switch jobs. These chicken pieces, previously breaded and frozen from Sysco (probably) shouldn't have taken that long. Not to mention there we 4 tables!!!!! Four! Had it not been for my kind server I would've left. Manager didn't come out to apologize for the poor work flow in the kitchen, more than likely because he or she is the reason the kitchen is mismanaged."}
{"text":"Good place to watch sports. Not great parking. Great beer selection but I think they need to clean their lines more often."}
{"text":"Definitely go to the bar. Plenty of options. Cool ambience. The taphouse pizza is delicious!! Great music Hope was our Bartender and waitress she was attentive and knew her stuff. Great for a late night meal and last call drink . Kitchen closes at 1:45am at least on Saturdays"}
{"text":"Came here to watch a Panthers game around kickoff with a group of 4 total. A group of 10 walked in right ahead of us and was seated immediately.  We were told there was an indefinite wait and 2 tables ahead of us by a rude blonde hostess. A group of 4 came in right behind us and was also seated immediately by same rude hostess. Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"150 beers on tap and the Carolina bbq platter. Need I say more? Great beers, good food, fun times."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were visiting from Orlando and I must say this place was amazing. As soon as we walked in we were greeted with smiles and even compliments of our outfits. It was a rainy day so it wasn't too busy. With that being said they allowed us to choose where we would like to sit and we chose the bar area. I loved the TVs and uppity atmosphere. MATT was our server and I must say he was incredibly knowledgeable about the many tap beers they offer. He took the time to listen to what we were used to drinking and he directed us to the perfect beers... so tasty, it was perfect. We order the CHICKEN QUESADILLA as an appetizer and omg it was incredible. Not your average skinny quesadilla. For our main entrees I had the steak fajitas and my boyfriend had a cheese burger with sweet potato fries. Wow the fajitas where amazing I ate it all. The meat had incredible flavor and the rice as well. We even ordered a quesadilla to go :) 
We even requested to have one of the channels changed so we can see the Grammys and they went out of their way to please us and meet our needs. Thank you so much for making us feel special and being great host while we were in town visiting. This is a place you must check out. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"We frequent this location but the visit we had Monday was by far the worst we have ever had. It was about 11pm when we came in and we ordered blue cheese chips, as an app, chicken fingers and a salad. After about 35 minutes we get our main course and then 5 minutes later get our apps. Now it wasn't a big deal because this kitchen is always super slow and we never get our food in order. The fries however, were dark, dry and salt less. I then ordered sweet potato fries hoping they would be better and it took over 20 minutes and the bar tender having to go back to the kitchen to get them. They were better than the fries but not by much. 
The real problem I had was that the bartender, Kasey, seemed to be the only one working and was dealing with multiple bar guests as well as having to answer the phone and call the manager in the office repeatedly to help the kitchen that was crashing. 
The kitchen is always slow late night here but tonight was the worst it has ever been. We were told there was 1 guy!!! That is ridiculous! I know how big that kitchen is and there should never be one guy alone, on top of having to do all the dishes. I can only imagine he was there until 5am! 
The new GM being a \"numbers guy\" and cutting down on staff has not only shown a disrespect for the staff making one do the job of 4 but also showing you don't care about your guests because the food quality suffers and guest experience suffers by having to wait 45 minutes for something that takes 10. 
Thanks to Kasey for taking care of us like always. I will continue to come here for the beer but I will make sure my stomach is full before entering."}
{"text":"Good food, fantastic beer selection.  Also a great place for any sports fan...there isn't a spot in the place where you can't see a TV."}
{"text":"Their beer selection is large and comprehensive, and the menu seems promising.  That's the extent of the good things here.  Their bartenders are utterly lethargic and are incapable of eye contact.  They want to stand at the left side of the bar and chat with each other while customers sit without Ketchup, butter, silverware etc. 
   The cooking staff does not know the difference between grilled chicken and blackened chicken, they just grill it regardless.
   Also beware when you choose your side dishes because they do not list their prices for each item.  Some sides are $3 and some are 99 cents, so if you want two sides with your meal make sure you choose the $3 side as your \"free\" (included) side and the 99 cent side as your \"paid\" side.  Its just an attempt to gouge an unsuspecting consumer."}
{"text":"I'm not a beer fan but I did enjoy myself here. Ended up with champagne, which was good. Wish they had prosecco but I know, I know, it's a beer place. If you plan to come here during a panthers game, get there early and grab a table. Otherwise you will be standing in the corner."}
{"text":"This past Friday evening we had a terrible experience at Rock Bottom. We left there looking for a place to eat but it was late (10:16pm). We opted for Duckworths. The girls at the hostess stand were friendly and said that yes, they were still serving food. Our waiter was very nice and prompt with our drink orders and food. He communicated with us while we waited for our dinner which thankfully was not a long wait because we were starving. The food was both pretty (presented well) and tasty. Our Duckworths experience saved our evening out. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, great beer selection, awesome atmosphere, management brought fantastic desserts our friend who is a cancer survivor."}
{"text":"Beautiful establishment. Pulled pork was seasoned well. Loaded tots were as the boys say...\"life\". Best cheat meal a man could imagine. But....
The....
Nachos......................
Amazing. Make sure you have enough friends too eat them tho , or a giant and your wife like I did."}
{"text":"I have been to Duckworth's before, but after this experience I am not sure I will ever come back.   The reason it gets two stars instead of one is that the Beer menu is awesome.  That is about all it has going for it.  We came on a Saturday night to watch a game, and after the 3:30 games were over it took about 30 minutes for them to change the sound over from the Channel Nine News to the Backstreet Boys, which was an improvement from the news but a game, any game would have been appreciated especially since we had requested TV's to be turned to the games (Which in itself took asking two different people and about 20 minutes).   If they were busy perhaps we would have been more understanding, but we were one of three tables upstairs, there was no big crowd.   The food was also subpar. I  ordered a Buffalo Chicken Wrap that had no Buffalo Sauce on it.  I clarified with the waiter that I had the correct food, and he said I did, and that it came with a barbecue ranch sauce to dip in. (The sauce looked all barbecue)   If indeed I did get the correct wrap (Still not sure I did) I would definitely avoid it if you are a fan of Buffalo Sauce, as there was little to none on it.  Since I was hungry and felt like I already annoyed the waiter enough I ate the chicken wrap, which was all it was and it was okay.   We ended up leaving at halftime to go somewhere else due to the slow service (Again, not really understood because it was not a busy night for them) and so-so food."}
{"text":"What a great choice my colleague made for my birthday lunch.  We had 12:00 reservations for 20 and were brought upstairs to a table that was already setup for us, with TVs all over the place.  And, on my way in I did peak at the downstairs area and it looks awesome, TVs everyone and a great atmosphere.

Back to lunch...We had two servers that were ready to take our drink orders and walk through the specials of the day.  We all placed are orders and shortly after food was delivered fresh, hot and as I have experinced in other Duckworth's location, great!
With 20 people there were a variety of different menu item ordered, but of the ones I heard about, the margarita flatbread, the philly's, and the cheeseburger (which was the special of the day), everyone enjoyed them tremendously.
I went with the chicken philly and added grilled peppers with the already included onions and provolone cheese with fries. The sandwich was piping hot so the chesse melted all over and was SO freakin good I cannot stop thinking about it. And the fries, fresh cut, hot and just the perfect amount of salt.

Overall this was one of the best lunch experiences I have seen with a large group and definitely would recommend this location to anyone, and you know I will be back."}
{"text":"After taking our kids to Discovery Place, my wife and friends went to get lunch.  We walked into Duckworth's, and I immediately remembered when it was the Fox and the Hound.  While the sign doesn't say that, and tables and decor that have been updated, the layout has not changed.  The good news is that the food and beer selection has!

We had all visited the location in Ballantyne, so we were not expecting anything extravagant as far as food or service went, but we were pleasantly surprised.  We ordered some beers from a very intimidating 150-tap beer menu, and then placed our orders.  The waiter was excellent - his attention was focused on us, he was prompt and checked on us frequently.  Already a good start!  

I got a Chicken Philly, my wife a fried chicken sandwich with a side salad, and our friends ordered shrimp tacos and a chicken wrap.  While I ate my generously sized side salad, handing cucumbers and cheese to the kids while my buddy preceded to make mean comments regarding my manliness because of my salad, I rebutted with the fact that it was delicious, fresh, and crunchy.  My plate was cleared promptly after I finished, and well before our food arrived.  

My chicken philly was tasty - it's not a Philly Cheesesteak from Philadelphia - hence ordering the Chicken Philly - but the hoggie was very good (soft inside, but slightly hard and chewy exterior) and the chicken was moist and flavorful.  My wife's chicken was also pretty tasty, as were the tater tots our friends ordered.  I did not get feedback on the shrimp tacos, but I will tell you that my friends plate looked like just out of the dishwasher, so they must have been good.  

I was very impressed and surprised with our visit, it's a good place to grab a bite to eat and a sample plenty of beers uptown."}
{"text":"Been here for both lunch and to stop in and get a drink. All 3 times I have come I have had great services and the food was good as well. The beer selection is probably the highlight for me. There was a lot of variety, you could go multiple times and not try the same beer twice. I will say the amount of TVs in the bar area is a little overwhelming but still the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"I do think this is the best of their locations. I usually get good service and the food comes out as expected. It is a nice to eat before or after a  show.

They do have some good daily specials my favorite is $3.50 draft beers on Wednesday!      They have a HUGE draft beer selection and it is updated on a regular basis. The list is in alphabetical order by Brewery which is a little strange so it takes a little while to read through.

Right now Uptown is a mess so give yourself sometime to get there. At night you can usually find a place to park on the street but if not 7th st ramp is close. 

I usually get their shrimp or fish tacos which are basic but a solid choice. I have gotten the nacho a few time and they are big but I don't think are worth the big price tag."}
{"text":"What a great place to watch a game, they have a crazy amount of TVs! We came here for the first time on Sunday to watch the Panther's game. Come early, its always packed on game day. We had to wait for seats, luckily the patrons watching the earlier game happily gave their seats to us during the last minute of their game. Our server, Amanda, was awesome, very attentive and was close by whenever we needed her. The staff as a whole was also very helpful, the game wasn't running on a TV near me but a server was happy to quickly change the channel to the Panthers game. 

Duckworth's has a great selection of beer on tap, it was pretty fun to check out the variety on their iPad system. I stuck with a Hefenweizen all night while the bf had his Bell's Two Hearted Ale, we were pretty happy with the drinks. I switched to rum and ginger ale in the last quarter of the game, reasonably priced for game day. We also ordered a 10 piece boneless wing order and a regular size of garlic fries, I wasn't a huge fan of the food but it did the job. The garlic fries were greasy and needed seasoning. The wings were crispy but lacked the heat we were looking for in wings. It was more of a mild than hot sauce. Neither of us finished our food, but we weren't really here for the food. It just would have been nice if it was out of this world. 

All in all, we had a great time and will be back for more! Cheers."}
{"text":"came in for a team HH, and had some apps to share. first off, they never refilled my iced water over the duration of 2 hours. i was too busy chatting to wave someone down. they did seem to be clearing plates constantly, maybe a bit too often if i havent even finished my food. we tried the nachos platter which was tasty - who can mess it up though? and then also had buffalo wings. the wings were relatively dry and not as saucy as i like them to be. i do like that there is a higher long table in the middle of the space to sit down and hang out."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner. Fajitas were really good- the special for 2 person fajitas was HUGE, a ton of food! Wings were pretty good and chicken tenders were awesome. Waitress was not sure on the beer specials but made an effort to find more info for us."}
{"text":"Duckworth's delivers exactly what you want, if you planned to go to Duckworth's.  They have great bar food, especially their wings (mommoo's & sweet bold and gold) and a giant beer selection.  There are so many breweries in Charlotte, but Duckworth's is really no slouch when it comes to beer selection and quality.  

If you have been to the other Duckworth's on Park Rd., then you may like this one better.  There is way more space, so you don't have to stand awkwardly in a cramped space while people whack you with the door on the way in.

Oh...and you may want to bring sunscreen, because the radiation from the 10,000 TVs may bake you while you eat."}
{"text":"We came in just for the beer selection and were glad we did. This is our first time in Charlotte and it has been awesome. Taylor was our bartender and she was awesome, she was able to direct us to a bunch of beers we loved and the conversation was great too. This place doesn't disappoint"}
{"text":"I don't leave a restaurant a bad review unless I really feel they deserve it, and I definitely don't normally leave 2 bad reviews, but I am appalled by my experience with Duckworths, and I don't ever plan to visit any of their locations ever again. I left them a bad review on Facebook yesterday because of some very poor customer service we received by a manager, and I soon discovered why they have a 5 star review on there. Instead of apologizing, they sent threatening messages to me and my friends demanding I take down the bad review. Sorry Duckworths, but after this experience I feel my reviews are more than deserved. People need to know how you really threat your customers and employees- not well."}
{"text":"Great food. MASSIVE beer draft selection. Downside, waitress did not check on our table as frequently as I would have liked."}
{"text":"THIS is what Raleigh Beer Garden should be like! Although Duckworth's doesn't have the Guinness World Record for Beer Taps, they do come very close! I really enjoyed that I was able to leisurely go through the beer list from the comfort of a provided iPad, which had options to display beers by brewery, location, and even style. It was easy to understand, easy to see my choices, and therefore easy to order. 

We went early on Saturday to watch the UNC v. State game, and found very few people inside. The space is large and comfortable, food was filling, and the staff was attentive and friendly. It's a great sports bar, with almost more TVs than beer taps (I kid), but there's a channel for everyone and every team."}
{"text":"The food is average bar food. The reason they get 4 stars is because of the amount of tv's they have and their staff. We were there during the NCAA basketball Championship game and the place was packed. There was a 45 minute wait for a table but it wasn't a big deal because we could still watch AND they served us booze in the waiting area. Big win for us!"}
{"text":"Filthy place, awful food, no mgmt oversight at Duckworth's downtown!  
To Management: please clean!  The bar top is always sticky and disgusting whenever we go as are the stools.  Don't just wipe down (but I think this isn't even done!), clean with soap and water-regularly! 
To the Kitchen:  get your food hot before you serve it! 
To Management:  Your staff looks like they always just 'came in from a storm'; dissheveled, sloppy, unkempt.  
Also, fix your computer system!!!  More than a few times your system is down so we can't get our beer club update therefore negating our purchases from going toward our awards (no repeats!). This Sucks!  
We visit for the great draft options and thats about it.  But we may stop all together very soon.  
This place is new but kind of gross inside and out!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town on Football Sunday and this place was amazing. TVs everywhere with every game one, a huge menu with some great food and the service was excellent. If your in town for a weekend definitely come in and check it out"}
{"text":"First.... If you are looking to watch a game / sports event, look no further. You have found the place! There are soooooo many TVs here. I have never seen so many TVs in one place. TVs galore.... have I mentioned the TVs? TVs EVERYWHERE!!!! Would you know it.... we happened to be in search of a place to enjoy some bar bites, drinks, and to watch a playoff game. We hit the jackpot!

Secondly, we all loved our food and it came out hot and just as described on the menu but the chicken nachos were such a great value. The biggest platter of nachos my nacho loving heart has ever laid eyes on and the toppings weren't cheap or skimpy. The chicken was grilled perfectly and very juicy and flavorful. These were my favorite chicken nachos I've had from a restaurant and if I'm back in charlotte looking for a laid back spot to watch a game, you'll find me devouring these nachos and washing them down with a grey goose & soda.

Speaking of grey goose & soda, our drinks were poured well and service from Hope was superb. There was some confusion about who would be serving us when we first sat down, but after a lengthy wait, Hope came to the rescue and turned our experience around. From the time she greeted our table, everything went up hill and she worked with her manager to offer us a discount for our initial wait. 

All in all, this was a pretty awesome sports bar and would be great for a laid back date to watch a game or to hang out with a big group of friends."}
{"text":"Food is good so is staff music too loud! And only water available for those under 21 still great over all"}
{"text":"Duckworths felt 'as advertised'. Flew into town on Sunday night for work, I wanted decent food and a few good beers near where I was staying. Tap list was extensive. Appreciated the bartender's recommendations. Burger was just what I was looking for - well cooked, good flavor. Attentive service at the bar, and plenty of TVs to watch the game. I'll be back if I'm in town again looking for a burger and a few good beers."}
{"text":"Look for my girl Lex.  She took care of use while we watched the game
  Good meal. good fun.  Good service.  That's all you need when you go out to eat"}
