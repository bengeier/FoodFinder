{"text":"If it was possible to give this place zero stars I would. I was given a Groupon to this restaurant from my parents. I rescheduled a reservation through Open Table for my boyfriend and I. We arrived 20 mins early and were \"greeted\" by a women. There was one other couple in the restaurant. I smiled and said \"We have a reservation at 6:45pm, we know were early, we can sit at the bar to wait.\" She replied \"Its fine just sit anywhere\" and asked the name of our reservation. As she sat us my boyfriend let her know we had a Groupon which she seemed less then pleased about. She returned to our table and asked again for the name on our reservation, which I didn't understand why it was so important because there was a total of two other people in the place. She walked away to return once more. When she returned she asked how we made the reservation. I told her through OpenTable and pulled up my phone to show her.  She smirked and said \"Ah that's why I'm pretty sure the Groupon says you can't use it with OpenTable\". My boyfriend and I replied back \"Oh no no that's just a place to make reservations\", she happily snapped back \"I'm well aware\".  She then asked for me to show her the Groupon, which she stood and read at our table, then pointed at the spot that says you must \"CALL to make the reservation\" This is when my boyfriend said, \"you know what we do not feel welcome here at all and we're just going to leave\" She didn't mind at all and simply said \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" and walked away.  I will never go back here. I can't imagine treating anyone like that. Needless to say we walked across the street and were greeted more we smiles and laughs."}
{"text":"Management does not know what they are doing. Staff is undertrained and unknowledgeable. The staff was be yelled at out in the open. Not what I was looking for when I was drinking a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is awesome, attentive, and extremely friendly. The menu is short and sweet and anything you order is fabulous! Will definitely be back!! And they make the BEST gluten free pizza!"}
{"text":"Cute little place with a small, but decent wine selection. The menu is extremely limited and the entrees are basically the appetizers plated over pasta. I brought my mom who was visiting from out of town and we both got the spaghetti carbonara... Or so we thought! First off, carbonara is made with beaten eggs and guanciale (or pancetta in the USA because guanciale is hard to find). What we got was Alfredo sauce with tiny bits of bacon mixed in. Second, the sauce had asparagus in it (#huh). I'm all for people adding their own \"take\" on an Italian classic, but it only works if you're actually starting with the classic!!! I might come back for a glad of wine, but that's it."}
{"text":"Went last Friday night (dinner) and sampled various wines (with a groupon) which were very delightful! Sorry I'm not too much of a wine-o so I know I'm not very descriptive. I would encourage anyone going there to get a glass of wine with dinner, they had a great selection. Wine aside though the dinners were excellent, full of flavor, the pasta sauce for the spahgetti was very robust and would keep eating it with the spahgetti all night if I could. The flatbread we had was great as well, it had goat cheese, prosciutto, arugala and balsamic dressing on it, which was the icing on the cake for me. Two reasons why I'm giving them 4 stars, 1. The menu was rather small, and could have had more of a selection... including desserts 2.The tables were very small and cramped which while they were fashionable they were not practical. 
  Oh also they had live music on Friday evening which was a big + for me!!!"}
{"text":"I love Vino Veritas and Anthony is great!!  The ambiance is wonderful and beautiful. Make sure to make a reservation on the weekend !  Try the flatbread"}
{"text":"We went here last night to use a groupon for two wine flights and two entrees.  We mentioned the groupon when we called to make the reservation. 

Our server greeted us pleasantly and asked for our groupon. She immediately brought our \"wine flights\" which were really just small tastings. 

We both ordered the meatball flatbreads.  The meatballs were very good, however the flatbread was a bit gummy and collapsed when we tried to pickup a slice. We ate it with a knife and fork. It was about 12 to 14 inches wide and the sauce was very good. 

The wines were served a bit out of order with a semi sweet Riesling to start.  This was followed by Pinot Grigio, Chardonnay, Cabernet and a Merlot.  We always taste from dry to sweeter ending with the cab and not a merlot.  We found this odd.   The \"glasses\" were plastic and there were maybe 30 ml (1 oz) per glass. 

When the bill came, they said the retail cost was $55.  The flatbreads were listed as $24 on the menu which makes the wine flights $21.  It seems inflated for basically two glasses of wine. 

I would recommend knowing this before you purchase a groupon. 

There was a piano player who did a wonderful job of providing background music. The atmosphere was nice. 

Final observations are do not use plastic wine glasses unless you are by a pool and see that flatbread isn't soggy."}
{"text":"I am sitting here having desert feeling compelled to write a review. One word would describe my experience... Phenomenal!!! Anthony, the owner and Carla have been  wonderful. They recommended what  wine would go with dinner.  They continued to walk and converse with the crowd.
Dinner was prepared to perfection. Wine is excellent. The entertainment second to none. 
If you have not experienced Vino Veritas you must.  The prices are comparable to the restaurants down in Little Italy"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and the wine was delicious (although expect it to be $8 a glass). I ordered the eggplant rollups over pasta and while the rollups were to die for the pasta was undercooked. They were great about it and wound up fixing the issue; but the pasta, which was gluten-free FYI, was still meh. My wife got the mussels, which were very delicious, but not filing so don't order if you are famished. 

An okay experience, but Little Italy has covered."}
{"text":"Visited tonight using a Groupon and unlike other reviewers we were told right away what our Groupon included (7 tastings), which specific menu items (as noted on the Groupon),  and what / if any additional up-charges would be.  Our server was knowledgeable, very prompt, and  friendly but not overbearing.  Being out of Riesling we were  offered an additional tasting of our favorite of the six wines available.  We started with a delicious app. of stuffed figs.  Next a large enough to share tossed salad.  Entrees (both excellent) included spaghetti and 2 delicious meatballs, and a melt in your mouth, stuffed eggplant with pasta.  This is a smaller, cozy place (leave the kids with a sitter) with a piano so it looks  like they may have live music a times.  Great food and service, cute spot and very reasonable prices.  We will be back."}
{"text":"We went because of a groupon and weren't disappointed! I got the spaghetti and he got the meatball flat bread-- both were great. Loved our server, she suggested the eggplant appetizer and it was fantastic. I'm a bit of a wine snob and they only serve their own-- wasn't bad but also wasn't something to get excited about. We'll definitely pop in again sometime for a glass and some eggplant!"}
{"text":"Came in here for some glasses of wine and appetizers while we waited for a table at a busy place near by. Seated immediately at 7:30 on a busy Friday evening. 

The wait staff seemed very knowledgeable and attentive. The manager came by several times to make sure everything was ok. Some interesting sounding apps. Had an evening special, prosciutto wrapped melon.  The melon was ripe and good. The prosciutto was not great. The other items we tried were good. 

They had an entertainer. He wasn't bad, but the place is small and it was so loud inside even before he started I almost couldn't talk to my date. After he started we had to leave. 

Lots of wines by the glass. They have full meal service."}
{"text":"I visited Vino Veritas last Friday evening. This place is small but mighty! 

I used a Groupon that offered two flights of wine and two entrees for a great price. The wines were delicious and so were our entrees. I got a carbonara pasta that was insanely flavorful. 

My only gripe with Vino Veritas was that I was upcharged $10 for choosing a pasta that wasn't included in the Groupon.  Although the server told me there would be an upcharge, I didn't expect it to be so much (Hey- I'm a recent college grad with loans to pay!). So, I guess the blame is on me for not asking for clarification.

Overall, this place made for a great date night with it's romantic atmosphere, full-bodied wines, and quality pasta entrees. Just watch out when using a Groupon."}
{"text":"Good stuff!  Discovered this little place when we were exploring Little Italy this weekend.  

Small menu- but everything we had was good- arugula salad, bruschetta and flatbreads.  Good solid wine list with lots of options.  

Service was prompt and kind- not overly attentive.  They allowed you to chill and enjoy your wine.  

I would recommend giving this place a whirl!"}
{"text":"After reviewing the restaurant the owner continuously harassed me through yelp and Facebook. Nonetheless, I will go ahead and complement their awesome cheese and meat board."}
{"text":"Very small little place, nice decor. Very intimate.  It's the kind of place that makes you feel like you are in NYC. Tiny little tables and all. Great wine selection. We had the portobello and chorizo app  (delicious without being greasy like chorizo usually tends to be)  and followed with house special of Spaghetti and meatballs (awesome, sauce was flavorful without being over bearing). I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a nice, little wine bar in Little Italy.  The ambiance is nice.  Romantic, trendy, cozy. The servers were attentive.  I only had wine while I was there.  They had a decent wine menu (a little only the pricey side, but its what you'd expect from a wine bar) and their food menu looked promising and decently priced.  I'll have to update when I try their food. Overall, it's a nice place to come hangout and have a few drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Amazing wine selection, nice owner and great gluten free options!!!! I will come back time and time again!!!!!!!!!!! Cannot say enough nice things about this place! Fresh food, good music, great wine!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty nice little wine bar. The wine list has a good variety and range of prices should suit everyone's budget.

We were primarily there for a quick bite, and the food was really simple and good. I absolutely loved the bruschetta, and the margherita pizza was nice and light. Perfect for one person. We also ordered the arugula salad with strawberries, pecans (or walnuts, I can't remember), and vinaigrette. Like everything else, it was the perfect portion for a lighter meal...and it was delicious.

Overall, with the positive service, we left with nothing to complain about. Hopefully it's the same next time we come back! Also, I hope to hangout for the live music a little next time.

If you're in little Italy and not in the mood for a heavier meal, I'd definitely recommend Vino Veritas."}
{"text":"Not sure why other reviewers have their panties in a bunch over this place, but when I dropped in for happy hour one Friday night, I was a fan.

I stopped in for a pre-dinner drink and enjoyed the house riesling. My fiance had a red blend and a cab, one of which was on special for happy hour. Yes, my bill wasn't cheap, but I'm not sure what people expect when they go to a wine bar. If you want to drink cheap wine, buy a bottle and stay at home.

We didn't order any food, but whatever was cooking in the kitchen smelled delicious. I wish they had vegan options for me to try, but...I'd definitely go back and just drink."}
{"text":"Spent the afternoon with the staff and owner   of Vino Veritas. Got to taste locally made wines both red and white (good juice) and enjoyed the large sampler cheese & salami tray and the special flatbread of the day! Couldn't have asked for anything better!! Thank you for the hospitality!"}
{"text":"Great spot in Little Italy!  Flat breads sooo good!  Thin crust but still yeasty in flavor.  The pepperoni had a tough skin though which made it hard to chew and cut but other than that a great flavor!"}
