{"text":"I've visited Rock Lobster at its Ossington location, and also the newer one on Queen West. I started both meals with the Lobster Caesar, a funky, pretty drink that's far less interesting than it appears: taste is comparable to any other caesar, but the portion was too small and it was lacking in alcohol. I had the scallops for a starter, they were fresh and yummy and tasted great with the dressing. For a main, I had the Lobster Poutine and Lobster Roll. The poutine tasted like any other, with a few bits of shaved lobster that added little flavour. The gravy was forgettable and it was too salty to be considered thoughtfully made. The lobster roll was also made with minced lobster- no big juicy chunks here. Both dishes were mediocre, though the homemade potato chip side was pretty good. 

My friend had the Fish Filet sandwich. At around $5, it was a great deal and just the right portion if you're peckish but not starving. 

I'd recommend Rock Lobster for a quick bite and drink. Don't expect fine dining, but for reasonably priced, moderate quality meal, it's your stop."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Rock Lobster today for a colleague's birthday.

We had a group of 6 so we called yesterday to make a reservation but unfortunately they don't take reservations - all too common these days. Luckily we walked in at noon and had no problem getting a table. 

Service was attentive and helpful. 3 of my colleagues had the fish and chips (made with haddock) and they looked very good, served on a slate platter and accompanied by ketchup, tartar sauce (which I was told was very good) and a charred lemon half which I also thought was a nice touch. 2 other colleagues had the lobster poutine which was a smaller portion than I had expected from pictures and judging by the price. It smelled very good however and they enjoyed it. 

I had the lobster roll, which comes with a side of house cut chips, and I added a side of potato salad cause I'm a sucker for it. As with the lobster poutine I thought the meat could have been a bit chunkier. It wasn't a skimpy portion but it looks like it is when the meat is shredded as it was. I did appreciate the restraint on the mayo but I missed a bit of seasoning and perhaps some mild additions to the roll (some celery or something?). The chips and potato salad were excellent, the potato salad had nice crunch from pickle and celery in it and a tasty dill creamy dressing. 

Overall I would go back to try some other menu items, curious about the jerk shrimp roll and that fish and chips looked great. Also want to try that over priced over garnished caesar sometime."}
{"text":"I had the lobster supper. For the price, I'd hoped that my meal didn't have a fast food feel to it. Not only did our meals arrive quickly, but the greens were charred and the  \"butter\" (I was assured it was *real butter*) tasted like yellow water and had about the same consistency. 

I wonder if they are trying too hard to please bar-goers as well as those hoping for a nice seafood meal. 

Once we were served our meal (within 10 minutes of ordering), our server disappeared. No offer of a second drink. 

Perhaps because it was busier, she was overworked? And yet there were 3-4 employees at any one time standing at the front door, chatting. 

While we waited 20+ minutes for someone to notice us after our meal, 3 separate servers came to tidy / organize the 2 tables next to us. 

Expect loud classic rock & excess staff who can't / won't help overworked servers. What not to expect? Butter."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice and I loved it both times! We love the Rock Lobster Caesar which comes with half a lobster tail (yum!). We started with the fried clams which are lightly breaded and deep fried - it was a DELICIOUS snack to go with the Caesars. We then ordered some oysters which were very fresh, and 2 lobster rolls. I have to say I preferred the Lobster Roll more than the Maine Roll. The Lobster Roll was filled with chopped up lobster salad, whereas the Maine Roll has chunks of lobsters. In theory, the Maine Roll should taste better but it was actually a bit dry and tasteless. The lobster roll, however, was very flavorful. 

The service was great and food came quickly. I would go back again. 
All in all, a great experience!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here for a quick dinner on a Friday night. We'd been working all day and had to rush to get to a concert on the other side of town. I'll say from the beginning that even though we were in a hurry my partner and I were both polite and friendly as we always are when we go out to eat. 

The waiter seemed friendly when we came in, but the service went majorly downhill from there. I didn't order a beer because I had already had a few and didn't want to drink any more because we both had to work the next morning. When I didn't order alcohol, the waiter's friendly demeanor turned cold right away. 

We hadn't come to the place for seafood because we just stopped at the first restaurant we came across, so we both just ordered burgers. I'd be happy to pay for lobster if I had time to sit and enjoy it, but that's not the situation we were in that day. The waiter made fun of us for ordering the one thing on the menu that didn't have lobster in it. He tried to make it sound like good hearted joking but he actually said, \"Seriously, guys?\"

When our food came, the burgers were both completely charred around the edges. I recognize that maybe they don't like people who don't order lobster, but in any restaurant I expect my burger not to be black. If we hadn't been in a hurry I would have sent it back. There was also a piece of lobster shell mixed in with my fries, which was pretty gross. I get it; sometimes pieces of things in the fryer end up in other fried food, but no one wants to chomp down on a piece of lobster shell when they're eating french fries. 

We both ate really fast because we were starving and had to grab a streetcar to the concert. When we finished eating, the waiter came by our table and made a snarky comment about how fast we had eaten while he cleared our plates. So rude! He asked if we wanted to see a dessert menu and we said no thank you, and he said with disdain, \"So...just the bill then?\" My partner wasn't even finished with his beer, but since we didn't order dessert he basically rushed us out of there. 

I will never go back to this place. Even if the food had been amazing, the service has turned me off of it for good. The Leslieville area is such a great community, and businesses thrive when they do their best to be good neighbours. I don't think this place will last there because many Leslievillians have had similarly bad experiences there."}
{"text":"Good service, good food.. A great place to go to hang out with friends. I had the fish and chips, and boyfriend had the bllt, both were delicious and great value for the price. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yes, some of the food portions are small but it's about quality, not quantity. We tried the lobster poutine, fish tacos and lobster roll - all of them were fresh & delicious. The decor is adorable, and the staff was awesome."}
{"text":"The main that I ordered was a glorified appetizer.They service was pretty awful. Eat beforehand"}
{"text":"Quick review:

Food: 
Amazing food. Lobster roll was great, the Caesar was the best drink - has a lobster tail in it too!
Waiting time: 
I went there after work on a Friday night and it was packed but we didn't have to wait that long - only about 30 minutes
Service: 
Not great. We waited at the bar and got a drink - the bartender was in such a rush that he got the wrong order. We went to the table and the drink was served to us there - when I told the waitress that that was not the drink we ordered the bartender personally came up to me and asked me why I ordered it if I didn't want it and walked away without listening! Just unbelievable! The service was just so rushed and they just don't take a moment to engage with the customer!

Note: service is not any better on other ('quieter') nights! I live on King West and I'm used to the busy, packed restaurants on Friday night but the service just needs to be better!

Overall: good food, bad service."}
{"text":"Good Bye shitty & gross Shanghai Cowgirl (don't hate me, you know I'm right) & helloooooooo Rock Lobster!

This new place looks amazing and is incredibly busy. Our party of 7 waited 1 hour for our table (be prepared!). We went to the Football Factory (I know, I know) for a drink and waited for their text that our table was ready. (Our party decided that we all really wanted to try it out and that we would wait - they had me at lobster. :) )

The patio was great with lots of seating with booths, a long hightop table & tables around the edge.

Most of our table ordered the Lobster Roll which I thought was really good, once I finally got mine (they forgot me). The rest of the table agreed that it was really good. It came with homemade chips which was a fun touch. We also had Lobster Devilled Eggs at the table which I think were coloured with beet juice (very yummy) the oysters looks meaty & fresh. 

My friends were mixed on the service...it took forever for drinks and food, they also forgot my drink, ran out of water glasses... personally, I think that the kitchen was slammed & the food runners were confused. We went during peak time so I thought it was fine. 

I want to go back when they aren't so busy (if that's possible) and try the Caesar which looked amazing!

***Go and check it out! Everyone that lives in the city will have to go at least once**"}
{"text":"Great food and Staff. The lobster roll was great! They don't have the Mac and Cheese at this location."}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled across this little gem one Sunday afternoon and it's official. . It's on our list for lobster and other shell fish delights. . Great atmosphere and service. . The food is outstanding for a casual dining experience. . Not everyone can get creative with lobster and other shell fishy fun stuff.  Great value as well."}
{"text":"Lobster poutine = nothing special, taste of lobster meat but curds was cold and some fries was cold and gravy not hot enough, too much cold, not hot enough!
Lobster dinner... I steam my own lobster at home and it is same as this place, delicious!  Hard to get it wrong, it no hard to steam or boil lobster.
Mashed potatoes cold, no hot enough, salad is standard, no effort put into salad."}
{"text":"I get the sense that management have read the previous reviews and have since made some changes. Just had a nice dinner - Rock Lobster Roll for me, Shrimp Roll for my dining partner. Both were great, Rock Lobster Roll was actually much lighter than I expected. The Rock Lobster Caesar was also delicious, and they had a decent beer selection. Service was professional, quick and friendly, certainly no complaints there. Only downside was the Syrup on Ice we had for dessert. You had to pour the syrup on to the ice yourself and then make lollipops with Popsicle sticks - maybe we were just bad at it but it didn't really work and the clumps were a little too chewy. Not the end of the world though.

Would go back!"}
{"text":"Worst service we've experienced in awhile.  No drinks or food delivered for 45 minutes.  Barely an apology when we walked out of the restaurant. The manager was completely useless."}
{"text":"YOU DO ONE THING! 
I have been here a few times and always had a great experience, but on my last visit I was served a very off lobster tail. Thankfully, yet disgustingly, I was able to spit it out before I swallowed it. They were very apologetic and comped a couple of drinks off my bill, but as a place that specializes in lobster and seafood, they should be on top of serving it fresh - not slimy and disgusting. bah. This makes me sad, as I did love this place. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Ok, so I've been eyeing this place ever since it opened up on Queen West. My sister, friend and I went for dinner there one night and experienced issues with the food. 
I ordered the: Lobster Roll. So here's the thing, the menu describes the lobster meat to be inside a top-loaded bun. So in my mind I'm thinking, oh it must be a large-ish roll. The bun was a slice of wonder bread toasted and folded in half....it came with chips and a pickle for $14, I finished the roll in 4 large bites....

My friend ordered the corn on the cob, again the menu description sounded good but she said the corn was dry and chewy and it lacked flavour (nothin' special).  

My sister ordered the grilled cheese again in between two slices of plain white bread, with cheddar and some other cheeses....? You can make that at home in a snap and it would taste the same. 

Also they should give the option of subbing the yukon chips for fries, no one wants cold chips along side a cold lobster roll for dinner. jusayin'

Give us what we're paying for, just because you're serving lobster doesn't mean everything else around it has to be so skimpy."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Rock Lobster Caesar ($13), oysters ($2.50 each), Lobster Poutine ($15) and Rock Lobster Roll ($15) on the patio.

The caesar was worth it for the little yummy lobster tail that comes on a stick with the drink. I wouldn't have minded having another dozen oysters. The roll was surprisingly light with the buttered bread, and the accompanying chips were slightly different in a good way. The poutine was heavy as desired with decent fries, gooey cheese curds and lobster (what else??).

Generally the service was good, and the overall vibe was friendly. The bar was quick. It took a while to order at our table, and another server took our order after seeing us waiting quite a while. Our assigned server visited the neighbouring table a few times, but only came to ours after we ordered and had our water, cutlery and plates down, and weirdly commented that he noticed we had been neglected earlier, after we paid our bill. Wasn't sure what response he was looking for...

I'm giving 4 stars because the food was good, the restaurant seems like a welcome addition to the neighbourhood, and the servers worked as a team to fulfil the customer's (my) expectations at the end of the day."}
{"text":"I don't like giving bad reviews because I know the owners of restaurants work hard. But something must be done about the shitty seating service.

Shitty service. Waited 30 mins for a table that was open the entire time. The lack of awareness of patrons time is ridiculous. I should make a video of this wait. The place was not packed yet it took another 30 mins to get your order. I mean come one guys!!

I informed our server that we waited for 30 mins for a table that was open the entire time. He said \"if we wanted to leave we we're free to do so\".

Tempting, but we already committed time to this establishment. So we stayed. On a positive note: The lobster cocktail was great!"}
{"text":"PARTIAL REVIEW... The Rock Lobster Caesar - Ketal One Vodka Steak Spice Tabasco Worchestershire Clamato Nova Scotia Lobster Tail ($12)
While the first time I ordered this (at Ossington), I found it a wee-bit watery, this one was totally on point. Very spicy, with a good kick of tangy clamato and a beautifully cooked lobster tail to soak up all that booze. This is a must order if you come to either Rock Lobster establishment.

Hudson's Bay Sour - Bulleit Bourbon Grilled Pineapple Old Bay Seasoning Lemon Juice Egg Whites Sweet Cedar Maple Bitters ($10)
Very well balanced sour with a gentle level of sweetness and acid, and a wicked amount of egg white foam.  I also liked the savoury kick from the Old Bay in there.
 
One Stormy Night- Mount Gay Extra Old Rum, Lime Juice, Spiced Chai Syrup, Cola Bitters and Ginger Beer ($10)
This was the winner cocktail of the night, so much that he had to have two. It was tangy, spicy, aromatic and slightly sweet, and the little ring of candied ginger just made the whole thing that much more addictive. Order-this-now.
 
Breakfast of Champions - Fruit Loop Infused Vodka Cointreau Aztec Bitters Cereal Milk ($10)
 was just so curious so I had to order this drink, and yep, admittedly, it tasted just like you'd expect. Kind of like your alcoholic mom accidently spilled liquor into your morning cereal and she didn't notice until you chugged the milk a little more enthusiastically than normal. This is probably not the type of thing you'd want to drink all night long, but a nostalgic novelty for sure.
 
Von Bacon's \"The Red Maple\" - Bacon Infused Maple Crown Royal, Chipotle Tabasco, Bacon Infused Worchestershire Liquid Mesquite Clamato Bacon Rimmer Candied Bacon Strips ($11)
While the Caesar's lobster tail captured my fascination, the candied bacon garnish here just totally stole my Jewish heart.  This drink was maple bacon through-and-through, with the unmistakable aroma of smoke from the chipotle and liquid mesquite, and a fabulous balance of salty, tangy and sweet. If you're a Caesar drinker, like whisky, and are not an observant Jew, then I highly recommend this drink.

Like the drinks, the food menu features Matty's most popular Ossington items in conjunction with a variety of delicious new dishes. Sure, you can obviously get the famed lobster rolls or moutwatering lobster poutine, and even new playful plates like a bacon-wrapped corn dog and battered fish sandwich, but there is also an emphasis on simple preparations that help balance out the more indulgent counterparts. Here you've got more raw bar, and steam pots, each that come packed with so much seafood, you can't help but feel you're on the East Coast. And for the fish-phobes at the table, Matt has also added a number of \"Land\" options as well including burgers, bacon sandwiches, salads, steak and grilled cheese. Echoing my earlier sentiments, this is cottage comfort food for the food enthusiast. While I would have loved to sample one of the temping steam pots, our server suggested that they're just so big, we wouldn't have room for much else. So together we decided to go \"full force tapas style\", as she described it, opting to try:
 
Lobster Devilled Eggs - Devilled Eggs, Lobster Egg Filling, Lobster Meat, Micro Greens ($7)
So I didn't think I even liked devilled eggs until I met a Matty egg. The generously swirled filling was creamy and seasoned beautifully, with a nice balance of subtle sweetness from the shellfish. A beautiful two-biter.

Brown Butter Digby Scallops - Digby Scallops, Brown Butter, Mint Green Pea Puree, Canadian Atlantic Snow Crab Meat, Micro Greens ($14)

A beautiful caramelized crust, and a perfectly cooked center, I loved the nutty sweetness of the brown butter against the lean shellfish, and the refreshing mint pea puree. This is definetly the kind of dish I could eat every day and never get sick of it.

Fillet \"Eh\" Fish - Local Whitefish, Matty's Seafood Tartar Sauce, Lettuce, Sesame Seed Bun ($5)

Matty told me that this was his take on the McDonald's classic, something I admittedly have never even tasted (I'm more of a nugget kinda girl). But man, if the trashy original even comes close to this version, I may hitting the drive through a little more. The whitefish was moist inside and wickedly crispy outside yielding a super satisfying textural contrast with the soft squishy bun. I also adored Matty's homemade tartar sauce, which was tangy, bright and creamy all at once. That s*it could go on anything and make it taste great.

Bacon Wrapped Corn Dogs - Local Made Hot Dog, Smoked Bacon, Classic Corn Meal Batter, Spicy Sriracha Mayo, Maple Mustard ($7)

I love corn dogs of all incarnations, and these were damn good. The batter wasn't too thin or thick, and the bacon added a nice smoky, salty bite. I also real..."}
{"text":"I went there this last Saturday and ordered their 3am Halifax Donair.... it was the absolute worst Donair I had in my life, to pass this off as a Donair is an insult to anyone from the Maritimes, the sauce tasted like milk, no hint of garlic or anything, 
The waiter said the cook was from Newfoundland, I think he should go back and figure out what is in the Donair sauce,.
A complete disappointment"}
{"text":"Decent meal. Lobster Mac and cheese was great, lobster roll was ok. A bit shocked when I ordered a glass of the house red and it came out to $19 on my bill ... Seemed like a rip off."}
{"text":"Came here about 9 with 3 friends.  Heard alot of good things about this place but was underwhelmed and probably wouldnt return.  My friends all received their food in about 20 mins while I had to wait over 50 minutes for my fish and chips because apparently since they were closing soon they accidently turned off the deep fryer ....right. Fish and chips was average that you could find anywhere else. Was not super impressed by the waitress either but it was late so maybe she was just tired. Overall I would say the food was pretty good but this is definately not a \"must go\" place"}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place got 3.5/ 5. The food was Meh, I got the lobster poutine and it was bland, I had to ask for salt and pepper. The servers need to pay attention cause they are very forgetful. I went on burger week with me bf and we  ordered  two burgers and one poutine. The waiter came back saying how they only have one burger. So we changed the order to one burger plus one shrimp sandwich and a poutine. After a long wait he comes back with only the shrimp sandwich and poutine, when we asked for a burger he said we didn't order one and he gave the last one away. He didn't even seem sorry for HIS mistake. So over all the food is way to over prices and portions were extremely small and bland, and service frankly sucked."}
{"text":"Food was bland and we had to ask for salt to add it to dishes vigorously. Had poutine and Mac and cheese. Mac and cheese was ok. But poutine - couldn't finish it. The Offspring is busting the speakers. Heard great reviews so we came to check it out. But.. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Tried out Rock Lobster on Queen West a couple of months ago when I was here for work, and heard great reviews, so my work colleagues and I decided to go and check it out. 

Their Caesars are great, the services was good, and the food was ok for the price. It was more the hype than anything else. The food was good and better service was luke warm, but for what you pay, it was ok. 

20% TIP? On the TAX? Excuse me?
Now, when it came to paying the bill, we all paid by card. We were all shocked by the automatic tip setting on the machine: it was set to 20%! And, yes, that was on top of the tax! We were outraged. Our bill was about $260 for the four of us, and they wanted us to tip 20% on the tax. 

We have seen this trend, especially on Queen Street, of restaurants setting the tip to 18%/ 20% on top of the tax, and this is not acceptable. Tipping, is based on the patron's assessment of the service provided by the server. We do not have to tip anything, if we choose not to do so, but we do, as a sign of appreciation. 

There were four of us, and we decided if these restaurants are to set a culture of  automatically tipping at 20%, when the service was luke-warm at best, then why shouldn't consumers set its own culture and set the tipping rate at 10% to start with then instead of the 15%? So we tipped 10% on top of the tax. That is what you get when you think you are entitled to 20% automatically.  Who can afford to go out and eat at a restaurant if they are expected to pay 20% on the tax, especially for ok food and mediocre service? 

Fortunately, our work requires us to eat out about three times a week, minimum, taking clients out to dinners, so we know what good food and service looks like.  And trust us, we have tipped servers over 40% when the service was exceptional, that's because they actually have worked for it. Just doing your job, and expecting 20%, is ridiculous. 

What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Service: 3* - fast, friendly, attentive, knowledgeable but pushy (kept overselling certain menu items and it felt like they wanted us out ASAP)
Food: 2.5* - tasted as expected (nothing to write home about), small portions, greasy, and overcooked
Ambiance: 3.5* - decent patio, upbeat, energized but loud & cramped

{"text":"We were seated at the patio in the back and it was great. Service was alright and it was really nice out. I personally wasn't too big a fan of the lobster poutine but did like the maine lobster roll."}
{"text":"You MUST try Rock Lobster.  My new favourite restaurant!  And that's a tall order with the great places in this neighbourhood. I organized a Ladies Night for 12ppl last Saturday.  Where do I start?  The food!  I ordered Lobster Poutine (OMG, heavenly!) and the Lobster Taco (I'm now inspired to host a lobster party).  Both were fabulous.  A bunch of girls ordered and LOVED the Lobster Caesar.  

Two weeks ago, some friends and I ordered the Lobster Steampot (4 lobster tails, crab legs, corn, shrimp, potatoes, chorizo, and all the fun tools to help you devour everything).  We also shared the white fish sandwich (amazing), and scallops.  Their lobsters and scallops are flown in fresh every day.  Ask Robyn, one of the owners and competitive mixologist, for a good drink.  He brought us some new, fun creations - one had cheerios in it, and the other had a piece of bacon, amazing!

Aside from the food, the service was also great!  Bonus!  Everyone was on it, they offered separate billing, they kept the booze flowing and were friendly and attentive.  The music - fun, old-school tunes.  Kept the ambiance light and energetic.  If you are not into seafood, the \"turf\" is fabulous too!

Affordable, fun and creative food and drinks, great service, what more can you ask for??"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying...
I absolutely LOVE lobster rolls!
And I have made it my life mission to try all the lobster rolls in the GTA I can find.. and i will keep you guys updated lol.

This is the second best lobster roll I've had so far. I ordered both hot and cold lobster rolls, and loved them. They are both served in a perfectly buttered roll with large chunks of lobster. This bread definitely MAKES this roll. Toasty on the outside and soft in the inside. The lobster portion was more generous than others ive had. I do prefer cold lobster rolls, but this hot one was actually pretty good. For 19$, each roll comes with a large portion of fries.. which was well worth it's price."}
{"text":"Lobster roll was absolutely delicious - big juicy chunks of lobster, light, crisp, buttery roll - just what a lobster roll should be. Chips on the side were a bit overcooked. 
Scallops were lovely and seared to perfection. And the lobster Caesar was awesome. Ontario Summer Salad was a disappointment; soggy greens with a really generic, oily dressing.

The service was absolutely fabulous. The kitchen was a bit backed up, but our server was friendly, charming and checked in regularly. All in all it was a great dining experience. 

(Oh and be warned, summer diners - no air conditioning.)"}
{"text":"We called ahead for reservation, upon arrival we where greeted with a smile, a clean candle lit table, & a cheerfully pleasant waitress.

At our table we enjoyed the Lobster roll, lobster pasta dish, Lobster poutine.. oh ya, & a classic Fish In Chips.  The dishes where all liked, I enjoy the fish in chips as the batter was light & crunchy, the fish(Haddock) tender and fries flavorful with a hint of sea salt. I also sampled the poutine, it was great as they really let the cheese melt and combine with the lobster & fries.

Service was fast, we'd had a drink & eaten within 35 min.  After we sat and talked briefly, well enjoying the atmosphere & prior meal all without feeling rushed. 

I look forward to going back for round 2!  Do yourself a favor and call ahead as they offer limited reserved seating. 

Have a Good Day"}
{"text":"No fresh lobster to be had in this place!  Ridiculous.  Mac 'n cheese was tasty but almost no lobster present.  I was not expecting fine dining but I was expecting lobster."}
{"text":"Did a take out for two orders of lobster rolls at $16 each. Firstly, service here is inconsistent. When I was done with the credit card terminal, the lady behind the bar, turned her back to me, and never thanked me or said goodbye. I stood there for a minute waiting but nothing. Second, the food was disappointing. Won't return."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying rock lobster but what a disappoint that was since we couldn't get accommodated for the two strollers we had. The one lady/man....I don't know what sexuality this person was... well whatever \"it \" is,  was was just plain rude. Telling us that they are in the \"middle of service. \" If you have baby and a stroller do not go to rock lobster. They are not baby friendly!"}
{"text":"LOVED this place!  the patio is wonderful on a sunny day.  I went for a birthday celebration there, which was risky given they do not take reservations but we lucked out since we got there early enough.  You must try their famous Lobster Caesar drink.  It's the best Caesar I've ever had: large, spicy, strong and garnished with a real lobster tail - YUM!  They have lots of other interesting drinks too - good place for the adventurous drinkers.  

For food, I ordered the lobster roll based on the raving reviews from the Ossington location - too much mayo for me personally, I'm looking forward to trying something else on the menu next time I visit.  My friends had the surf and turf burger, lobster poutine and oysters, they were happy with their choices."}
{"text":"I LOVE Rock Lobster, however I usually go to the other location. My friend and I decided to go to this location tonight. The lobster tacos were $1 more but this location has mussels! Everything was terrific here except for our server. She highly disappointed us. Very disconnected, rude-ish, lack of eye contact and lack of service! We got more service from the other staff then her. She didnt give me the bucket for the mussels and the other staff member noticed and brought one to me. We spend quite a bit here so thankfully everyone else made up for it. Will probably go to the other location where we are better recognized for our business and continue our love for Rock Lobster!"}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner here last night.  There was a 45 minute wait for a seat on the patio, but the hostess said we could have a drink at the tiki bar next door, so we went then joyed a beer while we waited.

All of us started with the scallops which were good, though slightly under cooked.  For mains, two of us had the lobster roll, one the jerk shrimp rolland one the crab boil.  All of our meals were delicious, though the rolls were a little on the small side.  The crab was well cooked and very tasty.

Overall a great meal on a very nice patio.  A little larger portion sizes would be nice, then again the prices are fairly low for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"After all the hype I was looking forward to rock lobster in the way a child looks forward to candy. I was unfortunately disappointed (which seems to happen when a place gets a name like this) with pretty much everything here. Our party of three ordered the poutine, the mac n cheese and the lobster roll. We weren't disappointed by the amount of lobster which is literally spread on everything, however the fries for the poutine and roll we're undercooked. In addition to that, everything was way too salty and...sadly kind if boring. Some of our wait staff were ok, however our main server decided to let us know she didn't have change, and complained that she was asked to provide her own float (which she wouldn't be doing apparently).. Sorry Rock Lobster...you've let me down."}
{"text":"First visit. Food was okay. Service was okay. The fact that they didn't have their feature beer or my next two selections off the menu (which already had several choices crossed off as not available) was just annoying.  Also didn't have featured dessert. If they can't manage the basics not sure how it would be different the next time. Reading other reviews here I might try the Ossington location but definitely won't return here."}
{"text":"Always wanted to visit this place since it gets such amazing reviews. We're no seafood town, so it would be great to have one nice seafood place to visit, if you're craving a lobster roll sandwich or a plate of fresh fish 'n chips. 
I understand this place isn't trying to set a trend of exceptional quality and fresh-off-the-plane japanese bluefin tuna, but I was hoping to get at least decent service for a small lobster roll sandwich that set us back $15 (the side of fries was an extra $4). 
We waited 10 min to order our drinks - we had to eventually find a waiter and ask for service. We waited another 20 to catch another waiter, so we could order the food. When we got the wrong order of sides - the waiter gave us a look and argued that it was the right order. Once they made sure that we did in fact order something entirely different, they brought it out...no apologies. They were by no means understaffed - there were at least 5 or 6 waiters running around in a place of about 20 patrons, yet we had to wait quite a while to even get noticed. Not sure what's going on at that place - the staff seemed to be nice, but had no sense of organization or creating a pleasant experience (we were served by 4 different people, every time someone approached our table w/ food/drinks/the bill/water)
The place is a relaxed modern wood-cabin/barn-type environment with a strong smell of industrial bathroom soap (at least where we were sitting). They do have a nice patio and the bar looks cool.
Great potential, poor execution. Gotta try harder than that if you're gonna serve fresh seafood, which (understandably) comes with above-average prices."}
{"text":"3.5/5! Loved the lobster roll but not the biggest fan of the lobster poutine or lobster taco. We enjoyed the oysters at this place, but it's not the most famous dish. I recommend trying the lobster roll when it's sold via food carts or at the food and wine show."}
{"text":"I walked in here by chance while wondering around Queen St. I must say they have all the details down to catch your eye. 

The food is fine. You will not be blown away, but you will enjoy it for sure. I had the shrimps, and lobster. To go to a restaurant with lobster in the name and not have the lobster is not right. 

Seafood restuarants are only as good as the food they bring in. This was fresh, and without frills. 

Have fun!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Ossington location before and had the absolute best experience. Food was amazing. Service was excellent. 

And so with that in mind I chose to plan a surprise party with them. Now, I know typically, Rock Lobster does not accept reservations, so 1 month before the event I reached out to the catering manager to see if it might be possible to make a reservation for a party. To my surprise and delight I was told it would be possible but we would just have to make the reservation for earlier in the evening. Completely understandable. 

The last email I received 2 weeks before the party was that everything  was booked and ready to go and that the catering manager would touch base with me closer to the party to iron out details. 

One week before the party I sent out an email to confirm the details of the reservation. I received absolutely no response. I sent a second email, hoping to receive a response. Still nothing. 

I called the restaurant and spoke to a manager who told me he had no idea what I was talking about and that he had no information about any reservations but would gladly speak to the catering manager personally and get back to me immediately. 

Much to my relief, he called me back within 20 minutes and told me everything was confirmed and arranged. The night of the party all of the guests arrive at the restaurant and are told there is no reservation, and they do not take reservations.  Very fortunately for us, a table opened up that was the perfect size and so we decided it was fate and we should stay for the great food. 

The staff was rude to us, in-attentive and we had to continually remind our server to bring items we had ordered. 

We spoke to a manager who did not care at all and was incredibly rude to us, informing us that he worked 12 hours a day and didn't know what to tell us.  I have never had worse service anywhere in my life and working in the customer industry myself I am very understanding of most situations that can arise.  It was the most disappointing evening. 

It is such a shame because I love the food but I will NEVER go back and I plan on telling every single client I currently see how terrible my experience was."}
{"text":"Three of us hit up Rock Lobster's Leslieville location last week. After my experience there, I completely understand why this place gets a 2.5. First off, I should say that the service was terrific!! Our waiter was very pleasant and attentive and everyone working there had a great attitude. Unfortunately this is not enough to make me come back. One of my friends had the novel Lobster Bloody Cesar (which comes with a huge lobster tail!) and the famous lobster roll sandwich . My partner ordered the lobster tacos. I went rogue and ordered the deep-fried fish and chips - and boy did I regret it!! It had the fishiest taste ever and was completely inedible. There was no seasoning in the batter at all. I ordered an order of the veggie zucchini tacos but they were very bland. My partner and other friend were meh-satisfied with their choice of food mainly due to the lackluster taste and the itty bitty portions. Overall it was a a forgettable experience and unfortunately we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The ambiance and the service here are great that's why its gets 3 stars and not 2. The food is just meh. There's really not much on the menu and what little they do offer is bland and completely uninspired. We had lobster poutine and fried clams to start. The poutine was very good but the clams (which are actually fresh not frozen) we're over cooked and dried out. I had the crab boil which consisted of about 5 crab legs , half a piece of corn and some potato chips. For the price, and given that its summer time, I couldn't believe that the 'seasonal veg' was a half piece of corn. Nothing seemed to be seasoned except for some salt stuff on the corn. The crab was also a little over cooked. My fiance had the half lobster that came with the same sides. His seafood was also over cooked. We were so disappointed with this meal and it was way over prices for the quality and portion sizes."}
{"text":"I really don't understand how this place has so many rave reviews. 
The service was terrible. My husband and I got a table quickly, then were left sitting there for 10 minutes. The table next to us that arrived after we did were actually served before us. A waitress finally came and took our drink order and food order at the same time. This is a huge pet peeve of mine. Drink orders should be taken first, and shortly after the table has been seated. Our drinks also took a while to arrive. By this time I believe we had be served by 3 different people. I ordered the lobster Caesar and it was actually pretty good, so at least they have that going for them. I found the menu a little confusing. It looked like a hand written photocopy, which is fine I get it, you're trying to be hipster. But it would be nice to have descriptions of a few of the items because the name of the dish didn't explain what it was. I would have asked a waitress about a few items, but they seemed too busy trying to avoid our table. 
We both got the lobster roll, which was tiny. We were told it came with chips (again, didn't say this on the menu) and figured chips ment fries. Nope, actually potato chips that are made in house. Which would be nice if they weren't burnt to a crips, slightly stale and covered in waaay too much salt. 
I guess the theme of the night was \"take too long to do anything\", because it also took awhile to get the bill (that was brought to us by yet another different waitress) and also took a while to flag someone down and pay by debt (again, a totally different waitress)
Overall, food wasn't worth the price so I would not return. 

TL; DR: place has awesome reviews and sounds great, but service is slow. Expensive for mediocre food.  They need to get their shit together and stop trying to be so hipster."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place after reading reviews and reviewing the menu. We are SO DISAPPOINTED. The food portions were very small and poorly prepared. I ordered the green salad ($12) - it came with about a 1/4 cup of greens with a cold poach egg and blob of dried out avocado. My husband and father ordered the Chowder - my husband's was all potato with very little lobster. My father's was actually okay. Since we were a group of  three we ordered the Steam Pot to share (supposedly enough to serve four). The lobster tails were barely legal (maybe 2-2.5 oz each) and all the seafood was overcooked. We left hungry after paying our $188.00 bill (incl one beer and 6oz glass of wine). In addition, the service was very slow and the background music was EXTREMELY loud. I usually like listening to good rock at a happening spot, but this was overkill. I was embarrassed, but politely asked if there was a chance they could turn it down a notch. I was told that while lots of people complain, the staff were not allowed to turn down the music. Our waiter told us the owner would \"not allow it\". Of course the owner was not there, so we were stuck yelling over the music and finally resorted to not talking through the meal. All in all, so terribly disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went to dinner at the Lesleyville Rock Lobster on March 28th, 2015.  I had heard a lot about it and was interested in tasting the famous lobster roll.  When we arrived at 7:10pm the place was busy.  I had made a reservation so we were seated quickly.  There are 3 Rock Lobsters now, according to the waiter, this is the 3rd one that has been acquired by Matt the owner.  I don't know what vintage the building is, but it is clearly in need of upgrades. We were seated at the back near the window and the side door, and it was cold because of the drafts coming from the window and door.  

For drinks, my sister and I ordered the lobster caesar and at $13 it is inexpensive.  We both ordered the classic lobster roll which is supposed to be the hot lobster roll with fries.  I didn't want the fries and since there is no coleslaw or potato salad offered as a side, clearly an oversight in my opinion, I settled for the Arugula salad. The roll arrived cold. My sister commented as well. It is a small roll and doesn't have a lot of lobster.  At $15, it is reasonable, but I would have preferred a hot roll and more lobster. The arugula salad was just ok.  My husband had the Fish and Chips since he doesn't like lobster and it was good, but the french fries - ends and pieces of fries were not.  The chowder he ordered arrived with the meal instead of as a starter, again an oversight.  There were only 2 wait staff that I could see, the hostess was helping as well, maybe they were overwhelmed or the chef was.  So here is my suggestion, go to Smoked and Cracked on Mt. Pleasant, yes you will pay more for the lobster roll, but it is definitely hot when it arrives, packed full of lobster and is accompanied by coleslaw or potato salad or fries, or chowder.  Delicious!!

Matt Pettit you have work to do at this location."}
{"text":"We went to Rock Lobster for the first time last night and were very impressed with the entire experience. From the moment we walked in we had someone attentive to us and explaining the menu, drink options and a quick history of the place, then had a friendly server who gave recommendations on the menu and made sure to check in. I had the lobster roll and it was to die for; better than what I've had out East. The chowder was good but I've tried better and would try something new next time. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat from quality staff to quality food."}
{"text":"After seeing great mouth watering pictures of their food from many food bloggers, I was excited when my girlfriend and I decided to drive downtown after class to give it a try. We decided to get take-out of the $15 lobster poutine due to the large juicy chunks of lobster seen in some pictures. However, after getting home and opening up the container we found a large pile of disappointment. Now I am not sure if they were almost out of lobster (that would be a bad excuse anyway) and tried to throw in what ever they had left, or they had their B team, but what we got was a little mess of shredded indistinguishable lobster on top of a bed of raw fries. My girlfriend stopped eating it after the third bite due to the hard uncooked fries, and just picked through them to eat the little pieces of lobster and cheese curds. One aspect of a good restaurant is consistency, and our disappointing experience with rock lobster was either a lack of consistency or just plain bad food."}
{"text":"Red Maple cocktail review only.

So I was excited to try the bacony cocktail. I was pretty disappointed to find that after you eat the bacon, the rest of the drink does not stand up. It would have been fine with Crown Royal, but the bacon infusion worked against the drink. Needs more tomato!

Try something else- you're not missing much with this cocktail."}
{"text":"The main reason we came here was to try that amazing-looking Caesar. You know, the one with the giant lobster tail sticking out of it. Guess what? Meh. There was quite a lot of ice. And the lobster tail was actually half a tail, cut down the middle, and no lobster fork was provided. So we had no real way to get the lobster meat out, and the waitress ended up clearing it before I'd had a proper chance to try. 

The oysters and the scallops were fine, and the tacos... I've definitely had better. Overall pretty lacklustre. I wouldn't jump at the chance to go back. I have a feeling the one on Ossington might be the better bet."}
{"text":"Went for a friend's birthday. Although we had reservations, they didn't have enough tables, but we moved the table next to us inwards. The service was good. The lobster club sandwich was good, much better than Joey's lobster grill cheese sandwich (and way less grease)!

The kettle chips tasted like old canola oil that needed to be changed. But the waiter exchanged them for fries, which were much better. 

The portion of lobster was more than I expected for a small sandwich and it tasted fresh. 

I also tried the lobster Caesar drink, but it was so spicy that it made me choke and I couldn't drink it. The waiter did not try to exchange it and just told me that some bartenders make it spicier than others - as though I should just suck it up. Needless to say I didn't drink it. 

I wouldn't go back, but all in all it was okay. I wouldn't tell anyone to stay away, I would just say to clarify with the waiter before you order. 

Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Looked forward to the visit. Damn was I disappointed.

Great patio. Waiter was friendly and welcomed us. Promptly advised they were out of Oysters and Steigel.

We placed our orders. The Caeser was awesome. The Daquiri was overpriced.

Ordered a lobster roll and a clam roll. Both were tasty but the oyster roll was very greasy. The fries which accompanied the rolls were also heavy/soaked in oil and not fully cooked or crispy.

Very disappointed. With a bill at close to $60 for two sandwiches and two drinks I don't think I will give it a second shot - too many other options which present a far better value for my money in Leslieville."}
{"text":"Always a fan of Rock Lobster on Ossington, this \"new\" location was opened a short while ago and finally have the chance to try it out this past weekend.

As the others have mentioned, there are different items on the menus of the 2 locations, which is a good thing considering there are more options and varieties to choose from.

We had the lobster roll, lobster poutine, devilled eggs, and the Steam Whistle steam pot which is simply amazing!! The lobster Caesar was awesome as well.

Great service from the wait staff and the experience was very enjoyable.

There are other dishes that we really wanted to try but since the steam pot was so filling, there was no way we can do it. So I guess there's another good reason for us to go back there soon!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 if I could award half marks.  
I've been to both locations and on both occasions felt that the lobster was not as fresh and juicy as perhaps it could be.  I don't have high expectations for seafood around here given that we are not a coastal city. 
The lobster roll was good but some chunks of lobster were a bit too fishy for my tastes.  The chips were really delicious.  
Also really liked the surf and turf burger - for a place that specializes in lobster, their beef patty sure is tasty!
The lobster poutine had good ingredients - crispy fries, cheese curds and gravy... but it could have used more cheese curds and more gravy but that's just personal preference on how I like my poutines!
Sad dessert menu (one item - maple lollipops).
The menu is different than what is posted on the website - in actuality they do have more options on the restaurant menu.  Prices are reasonable, though portions are on the small side.
Try this place at least once :)
PS The Ossington location had a lobster mac & cheese over the summer whereas this one did not have it on the menu. Slight disappointment!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try Rock Lobster, and needed a quick bite before heading to a play at Passe Muraille. We each had a beer, and then shared nibblies- Donair Poutine, Fish Cakes, and Fried Pickles. 

Firstly, the beer (at around $7) was not a pint at all, but more like a 12 (or at most a 14oz. glass). We were both disappointed and felt ripped off. If a pint is not 18 to 20 oz., unless it's some sort of specialty beer, print the volume on the menu. This type of sneaky marketing is both tacky and deceiving. 

The food was a huge disappointment all around. The fried pickles were so so, but the batter was extremely greasy and a bit tasteless. The fish cakes were burnt and tiny; at $11 for three tiny, mediocre cakes, they seemed very overpriced and weren't nearly as good as others we've tried. 

The Poutine was the absolute worst part of the meal, hands down. The fries were burnt and the miniscule pile of cheese curds weren't even luke warm, let alone deliciously hot and melted as you would expect on any good Poutine. The small portion of Donair meat was dry and the sauce itself was so sweet and seemed like it belonged on a dessert. I understand Donair sauce is meant to be sweet, but my boyfriend said it was terrible compared to the tasty sauce they serve in the Maritimes. The hardest pill to swallow: Poutine for $15. I have no problem paying more money for a novelty twist on a meal when it is delicious, but I would have much rather enjoyed a Poutine from NY Fries, or even McDonalds (tells you just how bad this was).

The food wasn't even mediocre, it was absolutely terrible. 

The only thing that wasn't a huge disappointment was the service. It didn't knock my socks off, but it was fine and the waitress was pleasant and attentive. 

Needless to say, it's too bad, but we won't be back. I highly recommend checking out ANY other funky little place on this Queen West strip and skipping this joint. I have never written a review on Yelp, ever, and if anything, I am usually only compelled to write a good review on a place because I rarely have a night out when I can't find any upside to a meal/restaurant. We both realized that neither of us could remember a time when we had enjoyed a meal out as little as this one. This place was just terrible. Don't waste your money or your time."}
{"text":"They should have 2 sizes for their meals - I am not someone with a large appetite but one plate alone is not enough for a meal. My wine came from a tap which was great, ordered by the ounce, but it was lukewarm! The lobster roll was small but tasty, the side of chips would have been good if the oil they were deep fried in had been changed recently - gross. 

More interesting finds on the menu than the Shanghai Cowgirl menu but I do miss the jalapeno grilled cheese! The patio was always a great place to grab a drink but partly because it was so quiet - good for us, not so good for business. Not the kind of place to go just grab a drink anymore...more like a get in, get out, get cheap sub par lobster kind of place. Disappointed."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place when we walked into the nearly empty restaurant. Enthusiasm dwindled as waited for our server for a half hour before finally getting to order a drink. Then we waited a good 10 min for drinks and eventually watched the server stop to take an order from another table with our drinks in her hand. We ordered the lobster rolls hoping for some great food to turn this around...the lobster tasted like it came from a can. It was awful and the bad service continued until we received our bill. Never going back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  I agree with a few other reviewers.  While the food tastes good, I found the portions a bit small.  When I think of lobster roll, I think of the rolls you get at  Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston, something a bit more substantial.  I'm not sure if we got a special lunch version and there is a bigger version.  But it was basically lobster meat (which tasted great) on what appeared to be grilled toast.  It tasted good, but I guess I just expected a larger portion.  We also ordered the poutine, which was good.  Increase the portions and I think think i would change my review."}
{"text":"Complete disappointment! Such Loud music- can barely hear the person with you speak. Manager was drunk, rude and flirting with his female waitresses and customers...My friend ordered the brisket burger and it was charcoal burnt! No real experienced cook could mess up that bad and they can't take it off your bill still-- knowing it is inedible! I got crab boil and my vegetables ( Brussels sprouts) were also burnt to black crisps pretty much! My crabs legs were ridiculously cold but luckily they didn't do anything to it with seasoning so it was EDIBLE! I got the Lobster 3 cheese dip- NO LOBSTER PEICES at all- blended together gross looking mush- inedible! Misleading picture on their website which made that dish look delicious but in actuality- totally disgusting and not WORTH 15$+ bucks! You could go get decent lobster ANYWHERE- don't ever go here if you are craving seafood!!! it is a complete waste of money- over priced and horrible food, horrible service, complete and utter disregard:-( What a waste of my money and time travelling to this place- this is the location at QUEEN AND BATHURST!"}
{"text":"$15 Wednesday Crab Dish is fantastic. Also the Lobster Poutine is great. Unfortunately I went there on the night of my 30th birthday for Winterlicious and it was terrible. Bad service (waitress constantly on her phone) and no white wine!?! But other than that night this place is usually an awesome meal and great time. Went 5 times, 4 great memories. 4/5 Stars"}
{"text":"Last time we went to the Ossington location, they were closed for lunch. It wasn't until after that we found out they had a Queen St location. We heard so much about this place so we decided to head here for dinner. The place was packed, we waited for 45 mins for a table, luckily, they had a big table available and we sat with another group of party so we didn't had to wait longer. It was so noisy in the restaurant. It is not the place to go if you want to have a intimate conversation. We were literally yelling at each other to talk and we were sitting just side by side.

The waitress we got had attitude issues, it was like we were in her way and don't really want to serve us. And gave us a cut eye when not all of us wanted to order drinks and just want water. After we ordered our food, she was so rude and was like you know this is not enough food for the three of you. We just ignored her and said we will order more afterwards. As a matter of fact, we were quite full and was struggling to clear the plates.

So at the end we ordered these plates. Lobster poutine - nothing special except for pieces of lobster meat on top of the poutine, really lacked taste. Lobster Roll - there were good chucks of lobster meat in there, the potato chips were good, the best dish of all for the night. Lobster taco - good size of lobster meat, it was good with the corn tortilla. Jerk shrimp bucket - it was very spicy shrimp indeed. Overall, not that impressed with the food, maybe I had too high of expectation. I mean there were good portions of lobster meat in each dish but the flavours was just not there to have the WOW effect. And with the service and wait time, probably will not return. I can say I have tried this place and will move on to other places."}
{"text":"Was really psyched to try out this new rock lobster that opened so much closer to me then the one downtown. My co-worker had gone the week before and said it had been exceptional so when we were looking for a restaurant for dinner I suggested here. We arrived on a Saturday evening around 7, we were seated right away which I thought was good as it was prime dinner time. 
Me and my mom both ordered the lobster cesears and my friend got the \"daiquiri\". Both were sub par, mine was very watery ( apparently if you get a small piece of lobster in it that means it doesn't need to taste good) and my friends was essentially a snowball with some liquor poured over top.
I ordered the lobster roll ($15), the lobster Mac and cheese ($15) to share with my mom, my friend and mom ordered the hot Maine roll ($18). Mine came out last which didn't make much since due to the fact that it was cold and the others were warm. The other people with me had to wait to eat until I received my dinner. 
Once I got it, I was sorely disappointed, the lobster was limp and sooooooooo bland!! The roll it was on it had more flavour, I was so upset. My friend commented that her lobster which at least had some flavour was very chewy. The lobster mac and cheese started off good, nice and creamy, strong cheddar taste, but as I got towards the end there was a strong taste of burnt oil around the edge of pan. Our total after taxes for the three of us (3 sandwiches, Mac and cheese and 3 drinks) was $116 with tax! Ouch! It wasn't just the burnt Mac and cheese that left me with a bad taste in my mouth. This is definitely not a place I would frequent again unless forced to with a group, nor would I recommend it. Sorry rock lobster if your going to serve only lobster make sure you do it right!"}
{"text":"I like the caesar... I know a few of you are saying it's a bit overcooked, but I didn't mind it. I think if you wanted a quick drink after work, this might be a good choice because it's a bit filling and it's got some spice. I ordered the oyster po-boy... never had deep fried oysters before, so that was pretty cool. I personally might have enjoyed a salad or something on the side instead of fries, but it didn't occur to me to ask at the time of ordering. I also had a bite of the crab cakes, which were delicious. Service was sort of lacking. I ended up just getting up and finding my own ketchup and even though a server saw me do it, the service didn't improve. It wasn't until we were all done that someone came by to ask how it was going. So yeah I'm sort of a fan."}
{"text":"I went during off-peak hours to grab a sandwich to go.  Or what I thought was a sandwich.  The atmosphere was nice, friendly ... I like the bearded greeter.  Nice guy.

But, $12 bucks for a jerk shrimp roll and chips?  I mean, if it was the size of an actual sandwich, that would make sense.  But it was appy-sized.  Tasty, but really small.  I was surprised when I got home, opened it up, and looked at it.

Chips were greasy.

Not sure I'll return."}
{"text":"I went with a good friend.  We shared 5 items.

1.) Lobster roll - Not good!!  If you've ever had a good lobster roll - this is the opposite.  I've had lobster rolls in Cape Code, Boston and Halifax.  The common theme was that they all had large chucks of lobster and minimal other ingredients.  That way you can really get the lobster taste.  At Rock Lobster Food co, you get a skimpy amount of lobster.  The lobster is chopped up fairly fine - almost to the point where you wonder if they used canned salmon.  It's got all sorts of different ingredients mixed in with the lobster, perhaps to distract you from the fact that there is minimal lobster flavour.  

2.) Deep Fried clams.  It was good.  I would order it again if I ever came here again...which I won't.

3.) Lobster chowder.  It was served in a bread bowl.  It was fairly good.  It would be better if they scraped out more of the bread from the bowl, so that you get more chowder.  Would be nice to have a little more lobster as well

4.) Crab boil - It was okay.  But for the price, you could go to Mandarin and eat all the crab you want.  The crab compares to mandarin crab...except that Mandarin pre cuts the legs (small cuts) to make it easier to get to the meat.

5.) Lobster Fettuccine - It was too sweet and not enough savory.  The lobster was 50% the ends of the claws...the rubbery not good flavour part of the lobster.   Would be good if there was more knuckle meat.

Not coming here again

Funny story...I bumped into a friend on the streetcar on the way to the restaurant.  He's from Newfoundland and lives in Leslieville.  I tell him where I'm going.  He says he's been once.  I ask him what he thought.  He gave me an answer that should have made me not want to go...He said, \"it's okay...salty\""}
{"text":"Soooo tasty. Loved the lobster roll, and my caeser. Boyfriend had the poutine and I wanted to steal it from him. 
The oysters were a bit small and not many dressings were offered for them"}
{"text":"We went right after this one first opened. I was pretty stoked given I've heard a lot of good things about their other locations. Oh hell no. The service was horrible. The food was horrible. The only good thing about the meal was the fact that they serve Stiegl Radler. Otherwise, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Brought some people from out of town there for dinner.... we had the lobster roll, poutin, lobster bisque soup. The server suggested we would all be full and that was enough.
I'm sorry but we were all looking around after our meals like that was it?
I wouldn't go back..."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! First of all - the service was atrocious. We had dinner yesterday and asked the waitress if there were any seats on the patio - to which she said that there were none (looking clueless) - so we proceeded to ignore her and go to the back to find that there were plenty of seats available. The rest of the night did not get any better. Our waitress seemed confused and half awake the whole time she was serving us - in addition to the snappy attitude that she had with us right from the get go. We were quite patient - but the food took far too long! After 45 minutes of waiting for anything to show up, the food finally arrives - fries were very cold and oversalted and the boiled crab was pretty much cold and limp. Lobster roll was disgusting and the very definition of mediocre (if that) - you're better off spending your hard earned dollars at the Starbucks just down the street.

Don't know how places like this still exist on Queen Street West, but the owners should be ashamed for providing such poor service (and bad cold seafood!) to its customers. Perhaps this will turn into a dated fabric shop or a tattoo joint once Queen Westers realize how crappy this place really is.

And we only tried it because Rodney's is closed on Sundays. Boo. 
Anyways the night was saved by Rob Gentile and his chefs at Bar Buca afterwards. Phew!"}
{"text":"I heard so much about the first two locations that I was really looking forward to trying out Rock Lobster.

The music was ear shattering classic rock (which I love, but which was way too amped up to have a conversation without screaming). There was no line up on a rainy Saturday night, but the servers were rushing us so much so that they were taking away the plates before we were finished the food on them.

My friend and I wanted to sample the menu so we shared 3 plates: a lobster roll with greasy cold potato chips, a plate of greens (beans, asparagus, green onions), and super greasy lobster mac and cheese topped with panko crust (and I couldn't find and/or taste the lobster).

No booze or dessert (we drank tap water only) and it was ~$70. Two words: never again."}
{"text":"Went in with a party of four and sampled a lot of dishes. Our lovely server recommended the hot main roll which was delicious. We got the Caesars - amazing! It comes with a delicious half lobster tail for $13! I recommend dipping the meat in the Caesar - yum! 

I tried the clam roll, the fish and chips, and the jerk crab (my fav) which my girlfriends had. The bill was a bit pricey by the end though. Totally worth a visit though."}
{"text":"The best place for a lobster Caesar! Rock lobster has a casual and laid back atmosphere where you can just walk right in for a drink or a meal. The classic  lobster caesar comes with a 1/2 lobster tail and is deliciously seasoned with a nice kick! Sooooo goood and pretty affordable! We usually come here for drinks so I can't comment on the food at this location."}
{"text":"Ok...I love my husband, but I might love Rock Lobster more!

We had been eyeing this place even before we arrived in Toronto but never thought it would exceed our expectations. We went here for a late lunch which is a quiet time for them and it was pretty bare inside with more people flocking to their patio. We immediately ordered one of their Lobster Caesars which doesn't impact you until it's right in front of you - there's an overwhelming desire to get that Nova Scotia lobster tail in your mouth! We then ordered their Lobster Roll with fries and Lobster Mac & Cheese - did we fall into a food coma, you ask? Why yes, yes we did. And we loved every minute of it! We kept looking at each other in between bites not believing that we were actually tasting this gooey lobster goodness in the flesh.

The overall feel and atmosphere of this place is cool, fresh, and fun. The staff is just cool complete with arm tats and facial hair and were fun to talk to. I'm seeing a lot of 2-3 star reviews on here for this place and that boggles my mind. Going during a slower time in the day helped I think, but I'd love to return when this place is kickin just for the atmosphere alone.

You rocked my face off Rock Lobster!"}
{"text":"I got the chance to visit Rock Lobster yesterday for dinner.  It has been a couple of months since their opening in the Queen Street West area and the place was packed for a Tuesday night.

My friend and I ordered a sampling of different dishes to share on their menu.  Here is what we had and my feedback:
a) Lobster Roll with Yukon Fries - delicious, I wish there was more than one roll.  It is a good starter to share or a light lunch/dinner entree
b) Lobster Poutine - loved, loved this dish, cheesy, greasy and comforting.  I could have eaten the whole poutine to myself
c) Flank Steak with mashed potatoes - well done dish, the steak was done to medium-rare and the potatoes were like velvet and divine

Service was great; I was greeted and asked if I wanted to order a drink while I waited for my friend to arrive.

Overall, I really enjoyed my time at Rock Lobster and I will be back for future visits.

Just a note: the menus are different at each location; there is no lobster mac n' cheese at the Queen Street location.  I guess they want you to visit both locations?!"}
{"text":"Beware of the 5 star reviews that have never reviewed before. Shady.

This place is MAYBE okay for a quick drink (bar rail). Paid $15 for a Caesar expecting something other then what was delivered.... Over poured on the Worcester sauce and ended up leaving half of my drink behind.

Food is passable at best, wouldn't recommend this place, the items on the menu look quite appetizing, but they lack flavour. There are soooo many more established bars/restos on queen street... Ascari... Table 17.. To name a few."}
{"text":"Went a week ago to celebrate a bday.

Atmosphere was pub like, wasn't as lively as I would have thought for queens st location.  There lacked a sense of consistency of warmth with the service staff, some where friendly others just didn't give a crap about your existence.

We ordered the steam pot...HORRIBLE mistake.  Food was extremely dry and misleading.  1lb of shrimp was only 4 small ones, 1lb or muscle was half empty, 4 lobster tails was 2 small tails cut in half, sausages was 1 piece cut into 4 pinky length pieces.  For $99, you would expect better.  Manager Came by with the attitude of \"what now\", kept asking if I want another pot...if something tasted horrible, I don't want to torture my taste bud again, get a clue.  Ended up waiving 25% but didn't even bother apologizing first and just walked away.  
The mac and cheese was good, fries were good.

Be warned...You are better off at the Ossington location."}
{"text":"This is a seafood restaurant for those who grew up on Kraft Dinner .. hipsters and such...
I grew up diving for seafood in the Mediterranean as a child so I'll take a pass on this faux.
Unbelivable what they charge for this garbage!! Wow!"}
{"text":"Yum!!!!
I haven't been to the Ossington location but this spot seemed continuously busy for a random weekday night.  We were able to get a table right away.  Our server gave us some recommendations about food and we started with a lobster taco to start - $5 for one which we ended up sharing.  Lots of lobster filling so guess it was worth the $5.  I then ordered the lobster roll and my friend ordered the surf and turf burger.  Though I really enjoyed my lobster roll, I had a bite of the surf and turf burger and secretly wished that I had ordered it! It was juicy with tons of flavour.  I'm totally ordering it when I return - and I do plan to return!

My only qualm was that the service was so fast and efficient, there were service staff walking around snatching empty plates off tables.  They literally grabbed plates off our table just as we were finishing the last bites. lol."}
{"text":"Sometimes these faux cultured eateries make me laugh. The hipsters that dwell in this place were amusing to watch...but listening to them gave me a clearer explanation why these eateries thrive. \"Cool\" (oh yes we get the B-52 reference) in many eateries means \"Grab Your Ankles\".... This place tries hard, but the prices are just laughable. Try this in New England and see how fast you go out of business. 

PS..nobody in Nova Scotia uses Old Bay (from Baltmore Maryland...crab spice) on a Nova Scotia lobster roll."}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time for dinner with my boyfriend & we both loved it. I was wary considering the mixed reviews but everything was spot on. Service was great - all the staff were friendly & attentive without being overbearing & the food was amazing! We had the lobster taco & the lobster poutine to start & the lobster roll & the buffalo shrimp roll for mains. We also had some of those famous lobster caesars! The taco was yummy but very small & the poutine was really good - one small plate to share would have done as a starter. The next time we want to try the chowder or the dip. The rolls were to die for - the lobster roll comes with homemade chips which are incredible & the shrimp roll comes with fries. We were stuffed by the end of it.

I didn't give it the full 5 stars as although it's really nicely decorated, the tables are very close together - you are practically on top of one another. It's also quite pricey but I think the food is worth the splurge. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"We've eaten at the Osington location twice. Both times it has exceeded our expectations with the quality of food and service. We had the lobster rolls as well as the lobster poutine (among other things). both times there were large lumps of delicious lobster meat in both and appeared recently shucked.

We could not have been more disappointed in the Queen east location. The lobster in both the rolls and poutine resembled something out of a can or had been shucked long ago left to soak in brine. The multitude of shell bits leads me to believe the former. They were flavourless and resembled a lobster mush. Not at all like our experience at the Osington location. The peel and eat shrimp shell was zippered, but the vein wasn't removed. Nothing less appealing than scraping poop out of the back of your appetizer. 

If I had to guess, I'd say the kitchen in Leslieville cuts corners and therefore serves an inferior product to Osington, at least the times we went."}
{"text":"The service made this visit. Only one part of our order was delivered originally and after checking on it for us, our server discovered that was the only part that was made. He quickly rectified the situation by having both our meals comped, which was very gracious. So what was a good first visit went to a great one because of that one thing. That's going over and above. I half expected them to take the late order off the bill, but certainly not the second one. It was a nice touch and made all the difference."}
{"text":"If fries, lobster and/or gravy are any of your favourite foods - put this in your belly immediately. PUT IT. That's all that needs to be said here. (The cocktails at Rock Lobster are wildly good as well.) It has a lobster bisque gravy, Quebec cheese curds (the good kind), fresh lobster and chives. It's obviously delicious and a front runner for one of Toronto's best poutines. It was $13 and worth every curd.

There are two locations in Toronto, go to one of them and better your life."}
{"text":"Everyone kept talking about the lobster Cesar's and boy did it look good on instagram. Umm well I didn't like it as much and lobster tails were soo cold. The Cesar it self was meh alright, I had better. But I guess I expected more since everyone kept talking about it. Will come back to try the food though."}
{"text":"I feel like this place could be really great with some tweaking. They sometimes run out of certain dishes, and when those items are the ones people make the trip for, it's quite disappointing. The waiter we had was attentive and friendly though, which was a point in their favour.

I tried their lobster roll and I enjoyed it. The bread was buttery but not greasy, and the lobster meat was seasoned well. The Yukon chips were fresh and delicious. The food was solid and the experience was okay, but in all honesty it wasn't that memorable. It's worth trying once."}
{"text":"Went for mothers day and the food was  great. 
Too bad it had rained because the patio looked really nice."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are delicious! We got the lobster poutine. Its was also really good. There is a patio out back which is nice for summer. I plan to come back and try their other dishes soon!"}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to make it here on a Friday night.  Arrived at 8pm and was told it would be a 1hr wait.  So they took our phone number and would call us when it was time which is great as it allowed you to explore the Queen West strip for a bit.  

We had the lobster taco to start and it wasn't good, rather small and tasteless.  

Being a poutine lover, I knew I just had to try the lobster poutine.  It was surprisingly small, but tasted good, yet not great.  The curds were fresh and made that squeaking sound the only great fresh cheese does as you bite into it.  The cut on the fries as rather thin for my liking, but the amount of lobster shreds on the poutine was better than expected.  The gravy tasted good, but was much too watery for a poutine.  I would not order this item on my own, but I could see it great for sharing to satisfy one's curiousity.  

The Lobster roll was pretty good.  At first I saw the small size of it was thought I was going to be disappointed, but I have to admitt it exceeded my expectations.   The buttered bread was tasty and the lobster as plentiful for the size of the roll.  The seasoning of the lobster meat itself was well done.  The chips it cam with was a bit too burnt as some chips were too crispy and blacken to eat.  But I would still recommend getting this if are here. 

The best part thing we had was the Shrimp Bucket.  This was sooo yummy!  We got served 12 decent sized shrimps, seasoned to perfection that had a bit of heat to it  made it among the best shrimp I've had in recent memory.  I will definitely get this the next time I'm here!"}
{"text":"Lobster rolls to rock lobster is what beats headphones is to monster--you kinda force yourself to like it to justify the price and hide your disappointment in its quality and promises of looks. 

My partner and I came in for dinner and we both ordered lobster rolls: the rock lobster roll and the Classic Maine roll. Each had its own side of either chips or fries which were pretty good for sides, but our disappointment came in the lobster rolls themselves. Both our rolls were too soggy and dripping with butter. The portions are much smaller relative to other lobster rolls we've had. The taste was pretty bland too. For something that's supposed to be served warm, our rolls were pretty cold.

We give this place two stars solely based on the food... Because for a place with the word lobster in it, you'd think it should be their speciality. 

Service itself was nice and welcoming. We just wouldn't come back for the food."}
{"text":"Service was friendly, but the portions are tiny and overall just too $$$. We all left hungry. One of our party doesn't eat seafood and his pork belly order literally had 4 stamp sized pieces of pork belly. I will say the rolls looked tasty at the other tables and definitely larger than our lobster poutine and lobster mac & cheese. Side patio looks nice, the other patios look like some frat party rejects - obviously the prices are not reflected in the decor. First and last time."}
{"text":"After I first checked out this location, I was so delayed in writing my review that it's now already been almost a year since (oops!), so in order to refresh my memory of course I had to go back.

First time around:
- CLASSIC MAINE ROLL: deliciously buttery bread holds loads of shredded lobster & just enough mayo. 
- ROCK LOBSTER ROLL: similar to above, except served cold. 
- I had seen pictures of the CAESAR and man it did not disappoint. love love love when my drinks come with it's own snack -- this snack being a small lobster tail
- we had some other cocktail that was forgettable. don't bother..have the caesar!

Second time around:
- had to go back for the CLASSIC MAINE ROLL. our choice pick for it's buttery-ness. just as good as we remembered; loved that even with all the pieces of lobster that fall out, the filling to bread ratio is still nice enough to continue eating on without having to pause to \"reload\"
- FRIED CLAM ROLL: it was pretty fun popping one by one the little fried clams that had fallen out of the sandwich, but that's all this sandwich had going for it. there's only a drizzle of sriracha mayo across the top so the entire thing was pretty dry to eat. disappointing.
- happily sipped another CAESAR - it's pricy but sizeable and really well balanced. delicious.

there's a nice patio for when it's nice out but the building tends to block out the sun by mid to late afternoon, something to keep in mind if it gets chilly in the shade"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend on a weekday afternoon. The interior decor was pretty fitting and the service was decent. I ordered their infamous lobster roll w/ Yukon fries and my friend got the jerk shrimp roll w/ a salad. The lobster roll wasn't that great. The toast was too buttery, I had to wipe my hands after every bite. And the lobster itself wasn't seasoned enough. But they did give a huge portion of fries that were pretty good. My friend's salad was just average (mixed greens w/ a vinaigrette) and the jerk shrimp roll had 3 pieces of shrimp in it..overall the food, service, and atmosphere were all just average."}
{"text":"My first time here was a disaster. They were out of half the things on the menu and there was no warning even though we waited an hour for our table. I was stuck ordering a burger and it was decent but not the beef totally over powered the lobster. The service was not great. She did the bare minimum. 

I came again with some friends and the service was much better. This time I could actually order what I wanted (lobster poutine) and it was pretty yummy."}
{"text":"A quick lunch here (burger week special) revealed a vibrant and bustling spot along Queen Street that is part of the next wave of restaurants helping to propel the area out of its lackluster past. As I breezed in off the street, I was greeted and offered a menu within a couple of minutes and was on my way to having a delicious kobe beef burger and refreshing Sam Adams pint. Great interior design with the seafood theme and displays of oysters along the bar. And some gorgeous hand lettering on their chalkboard menu helped my eyes adjust to the daylight. The burger was great! And I was wishing out loud that I had more time for another round. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Overall, Rock Lobster packs good food with an environment conducive for socializing. The Lobster caesar offers a solid quantity of lobster tail for only $12, the fresh oysters were indeed fresh, and the surf and turf burger enveloped my taste buds with fatty goodness. Special mention goes out to the fries, which were executed to perfection. Will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"This place - the definition of premature expansion. Rock Lobster in Ossington was all the rave. So they opened another one. Looking at the reviews here and on Urbanspoon. They shouldn't have.

I didn't hate it. The patio out back is a great place to grab a drink. Yes, their signature caesar is worth a try. I don't hate anything with vodka. It's my plus one for fun.

The food however wasn't great...mediocre bar fare at best. Bad fries, as in soggy, bland, soggy.

My friends and I still had a great time, because like I said - awesome patio to have a drink. But the food does no favours. Too bad, but it wasn't sad. Because again, just add vodka."}
{"text":"The food took forever and was pretty underwhelming. I wasn't thrilled with the portions either. Everything about this place, besides the vibe and awesome servers, has the potential to be better."}
{"text":"The fact other locations are closing speaks for itself. Was not impressed with my Maine Roll. My friend had the burger, and he was also unimpressed. Not worth the price or the time."}
{"text":"if you ever had real fresh lightly deep-fried seafood or a wonderful lobster roll- this place will disappoint."}
{"text":"I went to the Rock Lobster on Ossington and was not impressed at all so when a friend suggested we check out the new one on Queen Street west, I was reluctant to go (not to mention they took over my beloved Shanghai Cowgirl grr). 

Boy was I wrong. The restaurant is set up quite functionally and yet the decor has you stepping into the East Coast. The bar is set up so you can see the crab legs and lobsters tails being prepped and the best part about this joint is that back patio. Intimate yet lots of seating. 

We sat at the bar table in the middle of the patio. The table itself is narrow but it makes talking to your dining companion alot easier! 

We had the wine by the ounce which is a favourite of mine (it's an ontario vino which is key). We also tried the Lobster tacos to start. Delish! For our main we had the Steam Whistle Steam pot with Crab legs, mussels, clams, corn on the cob and potatoes.  All of this is absolutely delicious. 

Overall, great experience. A few minor kinks to work out but since it's only been open a week, I will cut them some slack!"}
{"text":"I have no choice but to rate this place at absolutely top-notch, as today I made my third visit there in two weeks!  

Today our family of seven had lunch at RLFC and we all very much enjoyed it.  The food was stunningly good and the wait staff was amazing - they went well out of their way to accommodate some requests from our group in regards to seating, and were very pleasant the entire (very busy) time.  

Our group enjoyed a very broad sampling of the menu and we were all very pleased.  

We'll be baaaaaaaaaaaaack!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE Rock Lobster!! My favourite things so far are the Lobster Devilled Eggs and the Lobster Roll! I wish I had the option to swap the chips for french fries with it, but it's so good that I usually don't care. The cesar with the lobster tail is always my go-to drink there! :)"}
{"text":"Everything is amazing including people, service, food, and music. My personal favourites are the Caesar with the lobster taco's."}
{"text":"Came here with one of my bffs and it was a nice night! I had the crab cakes and it was awesome flavour and scrumptious! They were small portions but worth every bite. Atmosphere is very nice and intimate perfect for catch ups with old friends or a date. They place nice music and service was great throughout the night! Some of the food items are a bit pricey but the quality is amazing and favour full."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here on a Friday evening and everything was delicious and the service was great. They are trying to create the same atmosphere and dishes from Nova Scotia. I think a lot of the negative comments about the food are from people expecting this to be a fine dining sea food place rather than authentic down east recipes (for example, the folded over toasted bread for the lobster roll is how they make it out east, so although it would appear to be a bad point, it actually how it is supposed to be done). We had the lobster roll, oysters and the Caesar salad with shrimp and it was exactly what you would get on the Pier in Halifax. The shrimp skewer was the best  shrimp I have had in a long time. The oysters were small but the price was fair too at $2.50 each. 

I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Hmm,

This review is a bit of a tough one. My girlfriend had been talking about coming here for ages, so two weeks ago, we decided to trek down to the location on Queen and try it. It was a Tuesday or Wednesday, but the place was mobbed! Most of the deuces were full and a Corporate table on a fixed menu came around half way through our meal and sat behind us. The Music was loud but classic rock, so I didn't mind. 

    We kept a careful eye on what was coming out, and while it looked delicious, it was quite pricey. We watched the Digby Scallops, the Lobster Taco and the Lobster Roll, all come out, and though they looked quite nice, the portions were small and they were all around $15 bucks. 

     In the end we opted for the $40 Pot of Crab, Mussels, Clams, Shrimp,  Spicy Sausage and Potatoes. The Pot was a good size, and more than enough food for the two of us. The only downside was that the Mussels were not quite properly cleaned and there was quite a bit of grit inside them.  Outside of this niggle, everything else was great.

I also had a Canadian Club Cocktail with vanilla which was okay but a bit too tart for me. I should stop ordering whiskey cocktails and expecting them to taste like whiskey icecream.

The only other issue was when it came time for the bill, we were abandoned by our server for what felt like 15/ 20 minutes.  When we finally, flagged him down, we got a halfhearted \"Sorry\". I know the place was busy, but just a little more sincerity would have the service more palatable and helped this place get four stars."}
{"text":"I had ordered delivery from this place, it looked great, decent reviews, but they screwed up massively with my order. I thought I'd treat myself and order Fish and Chips (i know fish and chips, but i knew the risks of soggy fish etc. but i had a major craving) , the fish arrived promptly, and fairly crispy too, portion was very good, but that's all that arrived, a strip of fish and tartar sauce, no fries... So of course I call and they promise they will be right back with the fries, now I did feel silly calling about just the fries, as it was only one small item, but it was half of my meal, I wanted fish AND chips not just fish. Sadly after waiting patiently for 90mins it took another phone call and almost 2hrs later I received my half filled box of fries that were incredibly soggy and completely inedible... 

Overall it just seemed that this place really didn't give a crap about their product or their customers satisfaction. I don't know if this place is packed every night or not, but one would hope that the business would give a crap about their customers satisfaction, which apparently they do not. No apology, nothing, just soggy fries 2hrs later... needless to say I will not be giving this place my hard earned money again, and hey, if you guys can't even get your delivery right, maybe you should just not offer it at all and save us hungry folks our money and frustration..."}
{"text":"oh man i love this place. 
iv been coming here one every week or two now for a while. 
i love the 13$ or should i say 15$ crab leg special every wed night... i believe the price was jacked up a few weeks back,
this location is the newest of the 3 and seems to not get as busy, even tho i have seen it hit capacity, nice little out door patio. it goes with out saying that you must try the rock lobster caesar ( voted best ceasar in toronto by blog TO)"}
{"text":"Lobster Poutine for $14 is a steal. Delicious!
The lobster bloody mary is pretty insane too for $12.

Great atmosphere and friendly staff made my day! Thank you!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for dinner last night and we ordered the Steamed Snow Crab Platter and the Lobster Boil Platter to share. 

The Steamed Snow Crab Platter was fantastic. The crab was cooked perfectly and it wasn't too hard or undercooked. It arrived with steamed vegetables and a salad (my substitution for the fries). Allover, I was very happy with this dish and the price was right at $20. I would give this dish 4-stars. 

The Lobster Boil Platter was pretty disappointing. The lobster was overcooked and chewy as a result. This dish arrived with French fries and steamed vegetables. The dish costs $25, which is a great price for lobster but I know you can order better lobster at a restaurant where they don't overcook it. If you want to try lobster at a decent price and don't care about your food being chewy, I would recommend this dish but my advice would be to get the snow crabs. I would give the lobster 2.5-stars. 

I gave this restaurant a 3-star rating because I strongly believe a restaurant that specializes in lobster should know how to cook it properly."}
{"text":"Popped into Rock Lobster for brunch today. I thought they had the full menu plus a few brunchy options but they just had the small brunch menu only until 3pm. We were ok with eggs Benny, but the table next to us got up and left. 

I can see how it would be disappointing if you had been there before and liked the food but could only choose from the brunch menu which is rather small, consisting of eggs Benny (with or without Lobster), steak and eggs, pancakes, shrimp Hash or a traditional bacon and eggs Brekky. They were sold out of the Steak and Eggs, but were also offering the Lobster Roll and Lobster Poutine.

We began with a Lobster Caesar each. Because what is brunch without a Caesar? This is still my pic for one if the best cocktails ever!!! Like, overwhelmingly delicious.

I ordered the Lobster Benny and my boyfriend had the regular Benny. For some reason out food took a really long time. 2 tables were served and almost done before we had ours. It wasn't a big deal until the end when we were getting a little cranky from hunger. The eggs arrived a touch overcooked. I prefer my Benny with medium yolks that run just slightly. These were almost hard. The potatoes were well seasoned without being greasy, and the bernaise sauce was delicious with the lobster, but only ok with the peameal.

I had a glass of wine and the glass smelled of beer.

I still like this place; it's fun and has a good vibe. But I think the brunch menu should be a little more representative of the fresh seafood that they offer. I could have really gone for a dozen oysters and some peel and eat shrimp with my brunch. Just a thought to increase sales...

I'll be back, but probably not for brunch."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Leslieville location a couple of times and learned some very valuable lessons. At first glance the menu does not look too expensive, but you'll end up ordering several things in an attempt to satisfy your lobster craving. The best valued item on the menu is the lobster roll (I ordered the warm one). With a healthy dose of hot sauce, this sandwich is delicious and you actually get a lot of lobster in it! This is contrasted to the other very enticing items on the menu including the lobster poutine and lobster mac and cheese- delicious in theory, doesn't work on the plate. The cheese in both dishes totally overpowers the lobster to the point that you can't even taste it! You're left with the sad feeling wishing you'd saved your hard-earned dollars and had regular poutine from the truck down the road. The other dish I'd recommend is the jerk crab- really tangy, spicy, and flavourful. 
Overall, this is a pretty cool place to grab some drinks (highly recommend the over-priced but worth it Caesar) and a lobster roll. Don't be a fool and fall for the other menu items- I have done it twice now and I'm left with an empty wallet and a serious craving for lobster."}
{"text":"Came here on Valentine's Day with my Fiance at around 3:30 pm for Lunch :). The service was amazing, the staff were attentive and very friendly. The Fish Taco my Fiance ordered was absolutely delicious!! My Fiance also ordered the Lobster Roll and he was it was fantastic. 

I ordered the Lobster Poutine and although I enjoyed it, I wish they would have given me a bit more lobster. Overall, I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I hadn't heard if this place before and stopped in for the first time after being recommended by a friend.
Place was nice, menu was simple offering something for everyone.

Ordered buffalo shrimp to share with my friend and loved it. The buffalo flavor was perfect and didn't over power the shrimp.

Lobster taco was good. Not great. The lobster seemed to get lost in all the flavors. 

Highlight: Maritime roll. Amazing. Huge chunks of warm lobster with butter and a perfect amount if mayo nestled in a fresh bun. Fries were fresh cut and cooked perfectly. 

Disappointment: service. Server was gonna take our food order before taking r drink order. She confused 2/3rds of r order but was quick to correct it. 

Will definately b back and would love to try  the Ossington location."}
{"text":"For a couple years there's been a lot of hype and recently, even more anti-hype surrounding RL. Guys, whatever, it's good (I've also enjoyed the other location). We live in Toronto; there aren't too many options of an equal price point with this sort of libation & crustacean slant. This isn't serious or \"good\" food. This is tasty fun!

It was a Saturday and we went for a late dinner at ~11pm (post movie, pre drinks) and the patio was nice and relaxed. We had the fillet \"eh\" fish ($5), lobster roll ($14) and bucket of steamed shrimp with Old Bay seasoning and lemon ($11). We also tried a couple of drinks, the highlight being their excellent version of a dark and stormy called \"One Stormy Night\" ($10) which is made with Mount Gay extra old rum, lime juice, spiced chai syrup, cola bitters and ginger beer. A stellar summer sipper. A bonus is the garnish - a bright green palm tree pick and a piece of delicious candied ginger. 

The fillet \"eh\" fish hits the spot (local whitefish, Matty's seafood tartar sauce, lettuce, sesame seed bun - upgraded mcdees basically) and I love how it's wrapped in gingham packaging with a big ol pickle appetizingly stuck in there. The textures are just as pleasing as the pretty packaging; the bun - soft and squishy, the fish- tender inside, crunchy outside, the sauce- good ratio of sauce to lettuce. This is an equation that is bound to make every bite into a stoner's delight. 

I was also a pretty big enthusiast of the bucket of seasoned steamed shrimp (try it with a side of cool beer) and I was left inspired to try this simple dish at home.

{"text":"Ordered the Rock Roll, which is basically just a tick slice of bread with some lobster tasting mayo on it. The bread was burnt, and had that burnt flavour. I had better lobster roll with actual lobster filling at McDonalds. The fries are soggy, but skin on, which i like. Surprisingly the brussels sprouts were really good. Friends ordered the muscles, and they were really really dry with absolutely no sauce. Had to send them back. The poutine gravy was bland... no flavour. For 20$ you would expect a good poutine. For two people it costed 85$, and we went to eat somewhere else afterwards. The service is great, and the waiter was very attentive. If you really want to try Rock Lobster might want to try the Ossington location, from what I heard they give two sandwiches with the roll, whereas this location only gives one. Would definitely not go to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This place has some of the worst food in the city at stupid high prices! The portions are ridiculously small. How this place is even in business I don't know. The one on ossington is slightly better if your in the mood to waste a lot of money."}
{"text":"I had a very disappointing experience here tonight and I'm sad to say that I will not be returning. My friend and I were really excited to come here to try their seafood but were really turned off by the customer service we received.

We ordered the Rock Lobster Caesar which was pretty good, but just a tad too spicy for my liking.

My friend and I wanted to try the Steam Whistle SteamPot, which we read about online. We did not see this option on the menu (only saw the larger steampot for $99), but was told that we could still order it. When the pot arrived I was shocked by the size of the pot. I was only expecting the pot to be about 4 quarts but it looked about double that size. I was worried that they had served us the $99 pot so I asked our waitress and my worst fear had come true! I've never felt so scammed in my life :( I expected some kind of apology for the miscommunication, but instead I was told \"more for you to take home!\" which would of been okay if the meal had tasted delicious. The lobster tails would have been the highlight of the pot but the meat was extremely dry. Also, I felt like I ate an endless amount of  shrimp, tiny clams, and bland mussels. This was probably the most deceiving meal I've ever eaten in my life. It was definitely NOT WORTH the $99. Moreover, since there was a lot of seafood I expected a larger garbage tin can or more frequent replacement by the waitress. Nope, our waitress only replaced the tin can twice in a span of 2 hours and I ended up leaving my shells on the place mat on the table beside us. Since the pot was way too much food for 2 people, I decided to pack the corn, potatoes, and sausage home as well as the chips from the lobster roll. The chips came in a box but I had to remind the waitress I wanted to keep the leftovers from the pot.

The only positive thing I have to say about this meal was the lobster roll. It was quite flavourful and I really enjoyed eating the buttery roll.


Overall, I did not enjoy my experience here at Rock Lobster and will not be returning!"}
{"text":"I think the name and my expectations were too high but somehow the lobster experience was missing - tiny bits in a roll or poutine were not enough to justify the name.
Service was not very efficient as it took 30 min for our orders to actually be sent to the kitchen after the waiter forgetting or asking for clarification - he also forgot to bring us our beers.
So mediocre service on top of just-ok food gives it only 2 stars."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Went on a Saturday around 7.  Was seated promptly.  That and the cocktails being surprisingly great actually are the only positives.  

We ordered a dozen oysters as our appetizer and a lobster role each as our main.  I ordered a pork belly just to try.  Was really hoping food would be good since we just moved fairly close and the original location was recommended by a friend.

The lobster rolls and pork belly came out curiously quickly, with the appetizer nowhere to be seen.  With the main on the table for ten minutes already (we tried to wait for the appetizer oysters) we asked for the appetizers to be cancelled so we could proceed with the rolls.  The waitress became visibly nervous and agitated, and just walked away.  She came back and said \"he's already shucking them\". I replied that while that was all well and good, we were now almost finished with our entrees and had no need for appetizers.  She reminded me that oysters take time to shuck.  I wanted to remind her that that is the reason you typically put in the order for the appetizer first.  Not wanting to be rude, and noticing how uncomfortable she was becoming, I offered to pay for the oysters, if that was the issue.  I just didn't want them anymore.  She assured me that was not a problem and I wouldn't need to.  That was the last I saw of her.  While she continued to work every other table in the section, a man came out and told us she was \"overwhelmed\" and he was taking over our table.  He was overly fake nice until the bill came, with the dozen oysters we did not receive and for which we were told we would not be charged, clearly included.  I said nothing.  Clearly they had sent another waiter in case I made a fuss about them charging me for an appetizer I never got, which I had already assured them I wouldn't.  He then said \"you should order something else next time\" in reference to the fact we had only eaten one bite of our lobster rolls as they were chewy and tasteless.  I paid the bill ($158 wasted), left a 20% tip (not the staff's fault if they are poorly trained and serve bad food...at least they were nice) but will not go back and hopefully can save at least a few people the trouble.

Hungry, we stopped in at The Country General on the way home for a cocktail and a few small plates.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of this place, at all. Over priced, under portioned, and incredibly inconsistent. One time everything tastes fine, the next you can't even finish your $15 lobster caesar. Disappointing all around."}
{"text":"Everything tastes great here, I'm not sure why they have low ratings! Ambience is great, service is nice, we had fish and chip, rock lobster platter, fried clam and lobster brisque .. So good! Defiantly will go back"}
{"text":"My wife has came here 2 times and has kept raving about the food. My mind was set for seafood since and finally had the time to see what she was talking about.

It seems like we came at the least busiest time. Sunday bunch time. We opted to seat in the patio, which was nice. Service was good in the beginning but got a little confusing with multiple servers approaching  us. I didn't know if we had 2 servers or if everyone was helping each other out??

The wife and I shared 6 oysters, lobster taco, fish & chips and corn on the cob. My wife raved about the Caesar and ordered one. I was out drinking last night and alcohol was the last thing on my mind and decided to go with a ginger ale. The Caesar was impressive and had to try hers. It was delicious. Every Caesar should come with a  half a lobster tail in it. The food was impressive but the service was a little scattered. I was expecting the oysters to come first but came last.

In the end. I had to ask twice for the bill and because I didn't know who was my server, I has to ask two different servers. I also had to go to the back because I was using a credit card. This was at the least busiest time.

Could've been a 4 star place but gets away with 3."}
{"text":"Had the lobster roll, that was good. Caesar was ok, not the best. Wish this location had the jerk crab and shrimp.

Cocktail list was short, they were \"between\" seasons. Very disappointing.

Lobster mac n cheese tasted like... mac n cheese. Lobster poutine tasted like ... poutine.

Seems adding lobster to things only goes so far.

Oysters were fresh, nothing to write home about.

Surf and turf tartare was succulent and tasty. Couldn't really tell it apart from steak tartare though.

Snow crab cluster was... frozen. No thanks.

Above average for western seafood. Below average for my seafood standards were I expect fresh/live seafood."}
{"text":"I love going to rock lobster rolling up my sleeves and getting down and dirty eating some crab legs and maybe some lobster poutine or clams. I loved the cajun flavour that the crab legs have. dip em in butter and so yum!!! Costs a pretty penny but it is definitely worth it. Plus they have a great selection of brew as well."}
{"text":"I like the lobster in this place. However the food is way too OVER-PRICED. $15 for a small pan of lobster poutine doesn't make sense. Neither does the $19 lobster roll. I enjoyed the food here but I won't come again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for a quick Monday night dinner. We were greeted by a friendly server who took us to our table right away. 

We ordered the Rock Lobster Caesars which came garnished with a small lobster tail. They were really tasty although you must be prepared to pay for that garnish (each drink was $13). 

We both ordered the lobster roll. I had the homemade chips and my boyfriend got the fries. I think I was expecting a larger sandwich for the price. And more flavour. We ended up dousing our food with the Rock Lobster hot sauces - I loved the smoky chipotle and jalapeño sauces. The fries and chips were average. 

Overall the service was great but the food was just okay. I think it is overpriced for what you pay, especially considering the presentation of the food (diner style baskets with parchment paper). It was $70 with a tip. 

I have had much tastier meals for the same price. For example, we went to Rasa which is an amazing new restaurant in the city. We spent about $10 more but we were BLOWN away by the tasty food. Rock Lobster didn't really blow us away, the atmosphere was nice but the food was just \"meh\" so we probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"It is no wonder this place has bad reviews for customer service. Called ahead of time to make reservations for 5 - 3 adults and 2 babies which they accepted. As we arrived , we were told that they do not accept reservations ?? And also do not allow strollers. Why accept and confirm a reservation if you do not allow either? Then they advised us to leave both strollers at the front unattended. They attempted to allow one stroller by the table but then a lady that works there pushed the stroller all the way to the bar and looked upset. She said \"we are in the middle of service right now \" as if a baby is so cumbersome to bring. Definitely  felt unwelcome the moment we stepped in. The demeanour of all staff members was very unpleasant. We ended up leaving as they were clearly not family friendly."}
{"text":"Visited on a Fri night at 8pm, since they don't take reservations we just walked in and had our first drink at the bar. My date loved the signature Rock Lobster Ceasar which had a huge lobster tail. We were quickly seated after just 5 minutes. The music in this place is so loud we could barely hear each other. We ordered the Surf and Turf burger and the FIsh and Chips, both arrived within 5 minutes which us SUPER fast! Both dishes were very good. The snow crab legs were also good, came with about 5 legs. Complimentary coatcheck! Grow a beard to match the male servers."}
{"text":"Let's start off with this place can cost you a pretty penny. For that reason, I'm docking 1 star. Because the costs will add up.
However, the portions of the food are fairly large.

I came in for a solo lunch. I'd been meaning to come to Rock Lobster for some time but it just never happened. It was fairly empty when I arrived, and remained that way throughout my meal. Only one or two other people in at the same time.

I ordered the Rock Roll which is their cold lobster roll on a buttered bun served with a side of fries or salad and a pickle. I have to say that I quite enjoyed my roll. I could not finish my fries (and in hindsight the salad would probably have been a better choice, esp since the fries were too salty for my liking). My meal was $19 plus tax. So it's up to you to decide if you enjoy seafood enough to pay that price or not.

While I was there the servers would make sure I didn't need anything and that I was enjoying my food and such. Service was excellent. There is also a back patio at this location, which seems nice but it wasn't the warmest day when I visited, so I stayed indoors.

All in all this place seems great, aside from the cost. I've definitely had comparable seafood at a lower price."}
{"text":"Came in for the famous rock lobster Caesar. It was not bad. But what was way more impressive was their new experimental create your own Caesar station. If you wanted to add bacon, chicken wings, with olives than you can."}
{"text":"A nice little seafood resto specializing in their lobster appetizers, whole lobster trays and of course their lobster caesar. A few friends of mine decided to check out this delectable spot on Queen Street West because we wanted to find a nice relaxing patio for delicious food and drinks. This place sure didnt disappoint as their popular lobster poutine and caesar was the fave of the night. You will truly appreciate a great caesar if you are a caesar lover because not only does it taste delicious but they add a little touch with a lobster tail on top! Overall, the food was great but if you plan on sitting on the patio, dont expect great service as they tend to be slower."}
{"text":"Another stop on #Adasfoodcrawl (ive lost count of the number) 

I love the atmosphere and patio in here. You almost forget it used to be Shanghai Cowgirl. 
Wooden tables and walls adorned with fish type stuff. 

Be prepared to spend a lot of $ here to get the full experience. Portions are small but tasty, but such is seafood 

We got the imfamous lobster roll (way better than any mchomard)  filled with lobster, mayo and creamy goodness. Folks complain about the burnt chips but i kind of liked it. Very oily though. 

Got the scallops as well and a small plate wasnt anything amazing. 

I might be back again when i am craving a lobster roll for $15."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here for lunch and shared the link buster and cheese dip, the service was spectacular and the food was great! I got the rock Lobster Caesar and it was fantastic! The presentation and atmosphere are great, I recommend the back patio as well as its quiet and peaceful"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere, great food, AMAZING service!  Will be back for more, thank you ROCK LOBSTER!"}
{"text":"If you like lobster and seafood check this place out!! The food is SO good, I felt like I was on vacation somewhere eating fresh seafood. As well, they played fantastic music! It is pretty small so we were lucky to get a table but it is trendy, cozy and cute. I am excited to go back!"}
{"text":"Tried of out the lobster roll with a friend after scouring the web for the best spot in Toronto, I neglected to add any hot sauce which probably detracted from my experience 

Overall the sandwich was a decent 7/10, nothing special or worth coming back for but definitely worth a try if lobster rolls are your thing 

Note: I am not the biggest fan of non seasoned Lobster so take that into account when weighing this review against others (I suggest adding whatever hot sauce you can stomach)"}
{"text":"ugggghhhh... if I wanted a mayo sandwich with stringy watery lobster meat then ive hit aces... only redeeming thing was the beet salad... rather hit rodneys or starfish... just my 2 cents..."}
{"text":"I have heard all manners of good things from this resto that has set-up in the Queen West neighbourhood so naturally I was excited to hear that they would be opening up shop in the east end.

Ordered the lobster poutine, crispy maple pork belly, and their rock lobster roll.  Only 1 of the 3 items I found really tasty and that was the lobster poutine.  The crispy maple pork belly was lacking in both serving size, presentation, and flavour.  It was crispy but I could not taste any maple at all.  The rock lobster roll was alright but it was like a two and half biter for me before it was all gone.

I actually like this place more for the little sidewalk patio and the very rustic looking decor.  It's a great place to have a few drinks, bask in the sunshine on the patio, and nibble on select items on the menu.  This wouldn't be my go-to place for a snack attack though."}
{"text":"would've given this place 4 stars a couple months ago for their lobster roll, nice outdoor patio, and $1/oz wine. 

but they changed the bread for the lobster roll or somehow it got less tasty. btw, $1/oz wine is a good deal but it's obviously not a very good wine.  I also absolutely hate the fact that they don't accept any substitutions. if I'm a paying customer, I deserve the option of substituting my potato chips for fries."}
{"text":"Went for the lobster Caesar and and a few apps. Threw in a bucket of Coronitas and was overall pleased. The $13 lobster Caesar is quite a good deal, and the quality of the lobster was not at all compromised. Apps were good, but again the Caesar was the focus."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this restaurant for the first time and I'm a big seafood person. I had the Winter Beet Salad and thought it was quite a delicious salad with a nice balsamic dressing. The next item I ordered was personally my favorite, it was the fried sweet and spicy cauliflower and when I had it, I couldn't believe cauliflower could taste this good. All vegetables should be fried this way if that's the case. The next item was the Famous Mini Rock Lobster Roll. It was good but I thought it would taste better if it was hot. The Pig Sliders that I had was a bit dried and I thought they could of used another bun for this item and added a bit more sauce to make it less dry. The Mini Halifax Donairs was quite an interesting dish as it combined savoury and sweet in a falafel bread. I personally thought it was delicious. Last but not least we had dessert which was a chocolate mousse cake but there wasn't anything special about it. Overall, good experience at the restaurant with friendly staff. Customer service was alright and we had the owner come out and greet our group and tell us a bit about the restaurant which was nice of him."}
{"text":"Their Lobster Caesar is totally worth your money!! FINALLY a place in Toronto that makes my dear Caesar shine and not like nasty cough syrup. Perfect amount of spiciness and balance of tomatoey to alcohol flavour. I also devoured the lobster tail in no time. I think the fact that it soaked in the drink tenderizes and flavours the meat or something because the lobster tail was yums.

Lobster poutine: All the cheesy and gravy goodiness that you would expect plus reasonable amount of lobster meat on top. Hard to not like this combo. 
 
Fried clams: $7 for a pretty good portion of clams. Small and greasy, these are not bad but don't expect to be wowed. 

Rock Lobster roll: probably my least favourite.. The roll is REALLY small so don't expect to be full on this. It also didn't taste like anything special.. Kind of dry actually.. This should be the most solid item on their menu but it actually ended up being the most disappointing..

Crab boils: 4 pieces of large crab legs with fries. We enjoyed this one but I wouldn't say it's the freshest crab around town but not bad for $18 

Side note: everything came with fries so we had a bit of a fries overload so be mindful of this when you are ordering.

Service was superb and attentive so although some of the food items weren't exactly impressive I think this is a nice seafood spot at a reasonable price for a relaxed hang out with friends. And say yes to the Caesar!"}
{"text":"Great raw bar. Great scallops. Lobster poutine is ok. Not huge into poutine anywhere though. Really fun place to go, great service. One of the better restaurants in the area. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Order the caesar with the lobster tail in it - you will not be sorry.

Wish I could comment on the food, but we just stopped in for a drink.

I will be back to try a meal for sure!!"}
{"text":"Food was good and fresh. Price point was a bit high considering portion.  Service could have been a bit better too.  Had to continually flag down our server for the basics, clean table, condiments....the bill."}
{"text":"Specialty: Seafood
Location:  538 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ontario
Menu items: Steam Whistle Pot for two ($39)

A new fish market has opened its doors to Torontonians, except this is no ordinary market. The newly opened restaurant by the same people that brought us their seafood delicacies at the Toronto Underground Market, have opened a second post in the city on the popular Queen West strip.

And when it comes to seafood, Rock Lobster Food means business. In early 2011, Matt Pettit started Rock Lobster Food Co., which is Canada's first Lobster centric food company. RLFC specializes in showcasing lobster and making it more accessible for Canadians to eat on a more regular basis. What started as a small pop up company has quickly become a staple of the Toronto food community.
Seafood is definitely a staple that always hits home with me. Rock Lobster Food is one of those unique places where one can indulge in all things seafood, no matter the time of day or season. The place is eclectic and is filled with a market atmosphere that screams loud, crowded and yet cozy.

The food and drinks are nothing short of perfect. If visiting for the first time, the Rock Lobster Caesar is a must-have.The drink is beautifully decorated with a Nova Scotia lobster tail that has been dipped onto a mixture of clamato juice, worcestershire sauce, steak spice, tabasco and vodka. A drink a bit high on the spice level, but certainly worth a try. If on the other hand spice is not on the menu for you, the white rabbit is a close contender. The drink is a combination of tromba tequila, lemon juice and horseradish, a thirst-killer for hot summer nights.

On the seafood front, the Steam Whistle Pot is a no-brainer if you plan on sharing a meal. The experience of having a gigantic hot pot be settled at your table, while guests around you also look in awe as you await for the waiter to open the lead, it's just a fantastic feeling. The pot is pipping hot and as the beer-filled smoke reveals the feast of snow king crab legs, shrimp, clams and mussels over corn on the cobs, red potatoes and sausage, the scent of seafood overpowers one's senses and quickly awakens one's appetite.

As the beer-infused fumes diffuse, the shrimp start glowing with a perfect pink colour, while the crab legs turn whiter and plumper. The mussels open up even wider, like lotus flowers, and the seafood feast begins. Though the king crab legs are hard to get to, the meat inside is tender and juicy. The corn is perfectly yellow with a nice sweet taste that complements the dish harmonically, while the sausage helps balance it all out. One pot is all you need to make your experience at Rock Lobster Food one to remember.

Foodie tip: Pettit imports his own seafood directly from fisherman on the East Coast (crab from the West) and notes that only the oysters are left in the trusty hands of Oyster Boy.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Funny this is my friend and I were going to 416 but there was a wait sober decided to grab a drink here.  I got the Caesar and shortly after we cancelled at 416 lol

The vibe reminds me of the East Coast which is fun and chill.  The staff were friendly and on point too.  

We got the Buffalo Shrimp, Lobster Taco, Lobster Poutine, and Buffalo Shrimp Roll.  Bomb Bomb Bomb so so good.

I didn't find it a tad overpriced but man it was delish.

Check out Matty's Seafood at your local Sobey's.  It's their retail brand."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night!!! Had the snow crab boil!! YUMMY!!! It was so soft and sweet, the butter was good but I never use it much...the fish cakes are really good...and the bloody caesar...don't miss out on it! Really good quality price...service was really good!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I came to this location I didn't realize they were still serving brunch. The brunch menu was very small, even more so that they didn't have steak left. As a result my group left as we were disappointed by our options. The waitress was very good though and understanding. A pity, had the chefs been willing to bring out a few dinner options they would have had a good sized group but they were not willing to accommodate. 

The second time I came was for dinner. I ended up getting the roll and poutine with lobster while my companion got the roll and taco with lobster. The food was fantastic and the waiters/waitresses were very attentive. While it was a busy night for them they didn't try to rush us so that was very appreciated. 

Overall I still love this place but I'm definitely more a fan of their dinner options."}
{"text":"I was meeting an old friend to catch up and she recommended Rock Lobster. I was excited about her suggestion as I do love Lobsters. 
When I arrived, the hostess informed me that it would be a 45 minute wait for a table for 2. My accompany had not arrived yet and I noticed 2 seats at the bar. I sat there while I waited and the bartender immediately offered me a drink. They also had a charging station at the bar which was very useful considering my battery was so low and I had to advise my accompany that I have arrived at the venue.
I had the Lobster Caesar and that is basically the reason I am giving it a star. It was tasty and spicy. It also comes with a Lobster tail which I did not try as it didnt look appealing and it was very small. 
The hostess was able to give me a table less than the wait time which was great.
My accompany arrived and we ordered the Lobster Roll. It was nothing special at all. It tasted very bland. The roll was okay; However, it was cold. It came with their house made chips which i found too salty therfore; had a lot of leftovers. 
The service was slow and most of the time our server was nowhere to be found.
When we were done, we wanted to order tequila shots however, the server took so long that we were getting annoyed and I had a train to catch. 
When we asked for the bill the server was quick and even waited for us to pay the bill.
The other star was for the ambience. It was lively and played goodul music. 
Would I recommend this place? I dont think so. Its a shame because i work in a 5 star hotel where guests ask me all the time for great eats in toronto and this place is definitely not one of them."}
{"text":"Went there Friday around 5:30. And surprisingly the patio was nearly full (considering they open at 5!). 
I took some time ordering and our waitress was quite patient with us. I ended up with the Maine lobster roll (warm lobster meat with spices, butter and mayo) and a side of kettle chips. The boo ended up ordering their fish and chips with fries. 
What was odd to me was the fact that he had asked for the poutine but without the lobster meat (I'm obviously the bigger lobster fan) but supposedly they couldn't do it. Not sure why, but ok. He ended up asking for a side of gravy for his fries 
He ordered a draft beer. It came in a cute mason jar -looking cup. I got their $1.50/ounce wine on tap. I overheard the waitress at the table next to us recommend the Pinot Grigio. It was really good. 
The lobster roll was AMAZING!! So buttery and stuffed with meat!!! But the downfall? Too small. I wanted to order another one but decided against it! 
However, the fish & chips came out on this huge rock-looking slab. I swear it was as big as a cutting board! With a whole layer of French fries and a nicely battered fish. 
It honestly tasted like regular fish and chips. Nothing special.
There was no room for dessert, the total was a little over $60. Which is kind of steep for my little roll. But it was a good experience!!"}
{"text":"Here are two things to know about me and three things to know about Rock Lobster.

Let's start with me...

- I am from Nova Scotia
- I have never eaten lobster before. It kinda freaked me out for a while and now I just haven't ever eaten it. I may someday, someday. 

About Rock Lobster 
- their burger defies logic in its utter scrumptious-ness. This is by far my favourite thing on the menu, it's fantastic and ranks up there as one of the best burgers in the city.
- the fries that come with the burger are truly outstanding. If your weren't getting the burger for the sheer awesome power of its burger-y goodness then it would be worth getting for the fries alone.
- the seafood is supposedly amazing and the Cesar has a frigging lobster tail in it. People love it! Buuuuut, yeah, I only ever get the burger. 

Get the burger!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Small portions for high price. Draft beer was small glass for pint prices. Fries were burnt and greasy beyond. Finally the automatic 18% for tip for each of our group was excessive. Never to return!"}
{"text":"Grand Opening Night for Rock Lobster in Lesliviille!

Taking over the Curzon that has been working on making improvements in the last few months, this 3rd location for Rock Lobster is a question mark as to whether or not it will be successful in this up and coming trendy community.

We arrived shortly after 6pm to have drinks and was welcomed by really upbeat and friendly staff. Our server was courteous and excited that we were here for the first official day of opening and gave us the time we needed as we debated over what to order.

I had to get the Rock Lobster Caesar (with the much raved above lobster tail) and husband got the Pimm's Rhubarb Cup (sounds amazing doesn't it).

After about 5 minutes, our drinks arrived and just before he put my caesar down, the waiter noticed the most important thing missing - the LOBSTER CLAW... so he immediately went to get that fixed.

The Caesar was smooth, loaded with a salty peppered rim, garnished with a long celery stick, lime, lemon, and a nice piece of lobster claw. I had no complaints and enjoyed the spiciness of each sip as I got deeper into the drink.

The Pimms cup had a hint of rhubarb but I felt like there was too much gingerale and lemon to really make it taste like anything different. I liked the added touch of a reel of rhubarb in the cup.

I would give my overall experience a 3.5 / 5, because given that the restaurant seemed to be overloaded with staff, our server disappeared for an extensive period of time when I was waiting to get change after paying the bill. He had taken my cash, and told me he would be right back.... but while I was waiting, I saw him i) serve food to customers, ii) reset a table, iii) pour water for other patrons, iv) walk over to the bar randomly to the point where I had to get his attention to see where my change was..... just a little odd in my mind.

Apart from the other Rock Lobsters, I think this caters to families as I saw at least 3 small children with their parents, which is a nice added touch. Looking forward to having the back patio open so I can get some sun!"}
{"text":"Solid lobster rolls, great ambience, great service! The only issue is that I found the portions to be small for the price - It was a really good season for lobsters this year and I know lobsters are a plenty and pricing by pound is very low... I didn't eat but my friend did and we had two cocktails and the bill came up to $60 after tax and tip."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with two other friends on Rock Lobster's second or third night open in this location. 

I was the first to arrive and asked to be seated on the back patio as it was one if Toronto's beautiful summer nights and I had heard great things about the patio. Our waitress was extremely attentive and good-natured. I had a number of questions about the menu and she was able to answer all of them with ease and provided a number of good recommendations. I was initially seated at one of the tables at the back of the patio, but was hoping to sit at a booth. One of the booths became available while I was waiting for my friends to arrive, and our server was more than willing to allow me to change tables.

The dishes are fairly small here so we ordered a number - some we shared and some we had to ourselves.

For myself I ordered:
Ontario Spring Salad - this had good fresh vegetables, but I found the dressing to be really oily and I didn't like how salt and pepper were already on the salad when it was served as I found the salad to be quite salty.

Ol' shrimp bucket - this was a really yummy dish! I was surprised by the number of shrimp I received (maybe 11-12 large pieces) as I believe this dish was cheaper than the peel-your-own shrimp from the bar yet had more shrimp! I would have to caution though to be prepared for your hands to get messy because you have to peel your own shrimp, and the shrimp are marinated in a delicious seasoning. I would definitely recommend this dish.

Dishes we shared / ordered by my friends:

Scallops - 3 big scallops served with a pea purée. The scallops were cooked perfectly, my only complaint is that I wish it came with more! Another winning dish!

Fish and chips - my friend ordered this and thought the fish was cooked well and not too greasy. She also raved about the fries.

Grilled corn -  two large, seasoned cobs of corn. Another item loved by my friends.

Lobster taco - this was probably the most disappointing dish of the night. While it was still good, my friend thought it was a bit of a let down compared to other dishes we had that evening.

Overall we had a great night and I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"The food was good but not outstanding.  Loved the Caesar. I found it a bit pricey.  I was left a bit hungry.  I think i've discovered that lobster is way overpriced.  For the same price i'd prefer a good steak, fish or even a paella."}
{"text":"I was quite excited about going to this place, till I got there and found that their claim go fame is just putting lobster pieces in or around other dishes.  The Lobster chowder was a plan chowder with lobster chunks from a can put inside. There was no Lobster flavour what so ever in the soup.  The Lobster Mac and cheese that my friend got was again a Mac and cheez baked in a oven with lobster chunks on top. This place just covers plain food with lobster. It was a bad book with an can lobster cover.  Oh and the Lobster roll was a bread loft rolled into a bun with lobster mix inside. It was have been good it was not done in 3 small bites."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch this Sunday (because Sunday brunch, duh). I've been to their other branch at Ossington and I can't say I had extremely high expectation for this either, but my boyfriend insisted on lobster and well ... It's lobster. 

The restaurant was quite empty when we got there which I wasn't exactly complaining about. It was probably due to the construction happening on Queen St. East, but if it wasn't for that, I bet the patio would be packed. 

We were greeted as soon as we went in by the hostess who was warm and friendly. We got sat at the patio and our server was immediately present. The service was quite nice. 

The Lobster Roll ($15) 
Basically lobster stuffed in between two slices of bread with chips on the side. The chefs do an amazing job of making this look great! But once you bite into the sandwich, you notice the bread isn't anything special, probably some wonder bread. The chips could of came from a bag a that's what it tasted like as well. Of course of the lobster meat was great, when is it not? But for what it costed, I expected a bit more. 2/5

The Caesar ($13) 
Comes in a sort of jug with a lobster tail and celery stick. This was amazing. YOU HAVE TO GET THE CAESAR.It's brilliant, and everything about it blew my mind, especially the celery salt. It's with every penny and more! 5/5 

The atmosphere was great, and request the patio if you can! I think this would be a great place to have drinks instead of actual food so perhaps I'll be back again and update my review. For now GET DAT CAESAR."}
{"text":"Great place to eat for all seafood lovers!! 
The food was  great, good portions and tastes amazing.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of was that I ordered crab and It was legs and I had to open them -- I'm not a fan of working hard for my food lol 

But if you don't mind working for your food then your good!"}
{"text":"Getting closer when it comes to finding great seafood in Toronto.

After months of waiting and drooling over pictures from friends I finally get the chance to try this place out. I was however very skeptical b/c so far it has been very disappointing trying to find a seafood joint in Toronto, I went in with no expectations at all.

You walk in and see a glass case with lobster, crab, oyster and shrimp on a bed of ice. The other thing is the loud music, was really not a fan of that b/c I could barely hear my friend that was just sitting across from me. I would not recommend going on a first date here you will be yelling at the girl the whole time b/c the music is just that loud.

They have a good selection of hot and cold items and a variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. A lot of people were ordering the lobster Caesar, not gonna lie it looked really good, but it's too bad I dislike Caesars. Was disappointed a bit b/c none of the jerk items were on the menu, the pictures my friends showed me looked amazing. However, I decided to get the lobster poutine, lobster roll and the seafood steam pot.

The lobster roll lived up to the hype, menu states \"our famous lobster roll.\" That combination of the perfectly toasted bread and the cold chunks of lobster was very refreshing. The chips that came with the roll however was greasy. 

The first bite of the poutine was very good, there was a hint of seasoning on the lobster that reminded me of fresh seafood from Virginia Beach, however it was only that one piece. Every piece of lobster after that was very bland the gravy, cheese curds and fries were good but not good enough to save the dish. 

The seafood steam pot contained 1 pound of crab legs, 1/2 pound of mussels, sausage and clams,12 shrimps, corn and potatoes and 4 lobster tails all for $99. Was it worth it? Partially, I understand seafood is expensive so the price did not bother me, what bothered me was I got teased. The crab legs were so flavourful and had that hint of seasoning. But when I got to the lobster it was bland luckily there was butter to add the flavour. The sausage had a good kick of spice and the seafood sauce help add to the flavour of the shrimp which were pretty big but the clams and mussels were tiny.

Even though I got teased it gives me hope that this place does have the potential to be that seafood spot in Toronto.

Items to definitely get
- lobster Caesar (even though I didn't order it everyone else did and it looked good)
- lobster roll
- seafood steam pot (good for 2 people)"}
{"text":"We went to visit today for early dinner after watching an episode of You Gotta Eat Here.  I was salivating for some of that lobster roll. I went ahead to order it and was really disappointed when it arrived.  For $15 it came with  handful of chips and a pickle.  The size of the lobster sandwich was nothing compare to what we saw on tv.  They did however serve delicious oyster.  We expected more for the price they charged.  I was going to get a few more from the menu but after that lobster roll, I changed my mind.  The staff was hipster friendly but the food isn't something you will crave.  There are far superior vendors inside St. Lawrence Market.  I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Pretty busy on a Saturday night. Good service, good food. We tried:

Classic lobster boil platter: tasty lobster, yummy fries and brussel sprouts, good butter.

Maine roll: they give a decent amount of lobster. It was delicious

Ginger ninja: tastes like ginger! Pretty good cocktail. I enjoyed it.

Overall, it's worth a try. I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"If it feels like most menu items here are decadent, it's because most menu items here are decadent. But in a good way.

We started with fried clams--breaded/deep-fried clams with a creamy dipping sauce served on a bed of super-crispy/oily potato chips. And we also got the appetizer fish taco--which was basically like a piece of fish you'd get with fish n chips (crispy/deep fried) but in taco form with yummy/fresh accoutrements on top. Decadent? Yes, but also very tasty.

For our mains we tried both types of lobster roll--one served cold (Rock Lobster Roll) with mayo-y minced lobster 'salad' (which had nice lemony flavour); and the other served warm (Maine Lobster Roll) with beautiful chunks of lobster on a hot crunchy roll oozing with butter and mayo. Both were accompanied by exceptional french fries.

My fave: the Maine lobster roll. It was awesome!

Oh yeah, and the Apple Crisp was an exceptional cocktail. As was the Caesar (served with a lobster tail!)

But the service, I have to say, sucked. It took 25 minutes for them to make our cocktails (note: restaurant wasn't overly busy) and when they finally arrived, the waitress pretentiously explained (without apologizing for the lateness) how \"these aren't made from a mix, you know...we make them fresh\" as if that's supposed to impress me? For a proper cocktail that costs $13 I would assume a powdered/syrupy mix is NOT involved. Geez, smarten up lady."}
{"text":"Visited about a week after this location opened. 

I was excited to come across this new Leslieville location after wanting the hit up the Queen W the previous week but not getting a chance.

Sat on the patio, which was nice and spacious and not too busy (I'm guessing due in part to people not yet knowing RL was there and also because of the construction along Queen).

Let me start off by saying that overall I enjoyed the food and drink we had during out visit, but the service just seemed off. I'm hoping it was just because it was opening week.

We started with a couple of cocktails - the Thai Reviver and the Rhubarb Cup No 1. Both were tasty. The Thai Reviver contained an ingredient we were unfamiliar with (calamansi); as our server never came by to introduce himself and seemed to be  nowhere to be found when we asked the hostess about him, we asked her what the ingredient was. She responded like she thought we were quizzing her (and acknowledged that she should know) but never offered to find out for us, which I thought was a bit strange. Thankfully google to the rescue.

When our server came around to take our order, it turned out that one of the items on their menu we wanted (the pork belly) wasn't available that night. Maybe it's just me but I generally hope that staff would disclose stuff like that when they hand out the menus.  I overhead conversation at the next table that also demonstrated the staff wasn't 100% familiar with their menu. I would have expected a business with two other successful locations would have staff training down pat, though I also got the sense that our server really didn't want to be there.

We ended up ordering a Hot Maine roll and an order of the lobster poutine. Both were delicious (in fact the lobster roll was better than I remember the lobster roll being at a TUM event a couple of years back). I thought the portions were reasonable.

All in all it was a good visit and I would return. Hoping the service gets better as time goes on as I prefer my food without a side of surliness. :)"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the Lobster Caesar was the best thing I've had in months! It was totally worth my $13. But it needs to be made quicker. Waiting 20 minutes for a drink is unacceptable. 
The price is on the higher end for average tasting food and normal portions. 

The service was the worst part. We entered the restaurant at around 20:30, the server tells us that they are closing soon - at 21:00. But the website says it's opened until 23:00? She explains to us that since it's a slow night, that they are closing early.  We decided to stay since we drove all the way there. Perhaps because we decided to dine in, the servers just stood and chit chatted away, not paying any attention to us. They need to be more attentive..

Will I go back? Nope.
Do I recommend this place? Nope."}
{"text":"Tried to get take out the other day..did not have cutlery nor napkins. Luckily I went to The Friendly Thai close by and got them (and they got my tip from Rock Lobster).
Whilst awaiting my order, I think the bartender lacked the charisma to do his job properly, and kept ignoring his customers. Heavy on the staff but skimpy on the servings, my paltry appetizer-size order of lobster mac n cheese would've been ok if there was actual lobster chunks in it, and not al dente macaroni swimming in a sea of gooey cheese soup. Obviously I am not the target demographic for the place, and the beer selection is pretty vanilla. If you find the regularity of a Kelsey's or Milestones  vibe is up your alley, then this is the place to go. I however will never be back, except to offer the hostess a better job elsewhere where her motivation is better suited."}
{"text":"Ordered lobster boiled as usual. Very fresh and very flavored. the combination with sweet corn is really good. Also ordered fried clam and a Salad to share. The clam is Deeply fried,very special and tasty!"}
{"text":"Order arrived 20 minutes after the delivery time.

Food was extremely overpriced and not very good. 

I will not be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Arrived at the restaurant at around 1:30pm on a Sunday with two other guests. It was not the first time we had all eaten there, however we'd never been there during brunch hours. That being said, Rock Lobster doesn't really *do* brunch (aside from a lobster benny which was only advertised on the sandwich board outside the restaurant). The menu was their standard one that they have during dinner.

Service was painfully slow. There were only four people working and the restaurant was almost full by the time we left (although we were inside, from what we had heard, the patio was also full - hopefully they had more servers outside). Our server also forgot about one person's side dish as well as a set of cutlery, but overall she was friendly and accomodating.

The food itself was alright for the most part. One of my six oysters was really bad and I spit it out as soon as I put it in my mouth (to which our server replied \"I hope you don't get sick!\" - yes, I hope so too), although they quickly brought out another one. I had the lobster poutine which was good and quite filling for brunch. There were quite a few chunks of lobster and the gravy was quite nice. My dining companions both got the lobster benny which they said was great. However it was not a huge serving and only came with a very small side of potatoes. They also each got a lobster taco which they said was great, although expensive for the size and small amount of lobster it contained.

It could've just been where we were sitting, but the restaurant telephone is incredibly loud and as there were so few people working, rang and rang. Not the nicest thing to listen to.

Overall, I don't think we'll be rushing back anytime soon. I cannot stress how slow service was, they really need to get their staffing in order. The meal was pretty expensive for the amount and quality of food. There is way better seafood (and brunch) to be had in the city."}
{"text":"ROCK LOBSTER! 

With a name like that you'd expect a heaping plate of hearty food. Just a glance at the Lobster Tail Caesar at another table had my expectations high. The drink looks like a meal in itself. In my company of 7, I decided to order the Jerk Shrimp Roll. Everyone ordered something different to get a good sense of their menu. 

After a long wait time due to an influx of patrons which our server courteously informed us about, our orders finally came. We all glanced at each other's orders... and of course each other, mildly laughing, a couple...insulted, and unimpressed to see how small the portions were for ALL of our orders after all that wait. It's not even complicated food to prepare by any stretch.

The Jerk Shrimp Roll consists of 4 (FOUR) medium-small sized marinated shrimp 'rolled' in a single loaf of white bread that's been grilled. It came with a side of fries. That is it.

Every single one of us was left hungry. Seriously. We continued at home.

It was $15 for the Jerk Shrimp Roll.  

FIFTEEN DOLLARS.

The portion is meant for a 12 year old. 

But not any 12 year old.

A LESLIEVILLE 12 year old."}
{"text":"Rock Lobster, thank you for making lobster affordable and trendy.  I would not associate the word \"cheap\" with Rock Lobster because when I think of cheap lobster, I think of getting an entire lobster at Chinatown for $20.  Rock Lobster is certainly not in that category and I would describe it as being classy but down-to-earth at the same time.

The restaurant has a patio in the back, but it we went on a rainy day, so we took a seat inside.  The atmosphere is very loud making the restaurant lively, but it makes for poor dinner conversations.  Thanks goodness it wasn't a date, and I had no interest in what my friend was saying... sorry Francis P. (just kidding).  

We shared the Crow's Nest, which is a pot of seafood steamed with Steam Whistle beer, and I'm not s huge Steam Whistle beer fan but boy does it work well with the seafood.  The heartiness of the beer works perfectly in the seafood pot mix.  It was super filling for 2, in addition to the poutine and taco that we ordered.  The taco was my favourite part of the meal, and if I were to come back I would order smaller dishes rather than the pot, although the pot was something we just had to try since we were there.  Another must-try is the lobster caesar, not being a huge caesar fan, I have to admit this one definitely has my approval."}
{"text":"Methinks that Rock Lobster might be writing cheques that its kitchen and service can't cash. It's an acceptable dining option, and if you're in the mood for seafood in downtown Toronto, I'd wager it's one of the more affordable options (which is not to say it's cheap), but it's not terribly successful at anything it attempts to do.

Except the Caesars. They are bloody massive, come with a half a lobster tail, and at $13, are definitely the best drink on their menu. I didn't order one because I am indifferent to Caesars, but one of my dining companions did and we all had serious drink envy when his came out. (By comparison, I got the Lorraine, which is just $1 cheaper, and was about 1/6 of the size. It also tasted vaguely like medicine, though it did look like something a lady from Downton Abbey might guzzle, so I sipped it in style!)

Service is well-meaning but a bit absent-minded (our waiter started off by promising he would bring us out waters, but after about 20 minutes, we had to remind him of said promise), however the staff are friendly and good humored and I genuinely believe they are doing their best. I suspect the problem is with the kitchen, which I think must have massive problems--as others have mentioned, it seems like Rock Lobster is incapable of getting dishes out in the proper order. Our requested app of the Lobster Poutine (!) came out about 5-minutes after two of our mains had arrived. Please notice that I did not say ALL of our mains, because in fact, 2/3 of our party were served a full 15-minutes before the remaining person. Don't know if the kitchen lost track of the final order or what, but given that we all ordered sandwiches, that's poor planning on their part. 

Although you will wait a while for your food, it is tasty, although for $13+ for a sandwich, I felt the main attractions were a bit meager. For those complaining about the bread used, I will say that if Rock Lobster is paying homage to the Lobster Rolls of the East Coast, then this is an authentic choice and nicely prepared. I felt like the fillings could be more generous, as it seemed like the rolls that came accompanied with fries were overshadowed by the size of the side. I figure the pricetag is somewhat inflated because we're dealing with seafood, but part of it is, I'm sure, just because. Rock Lobster isn't terrible value for what you get, I suppose, but it's not great either.

Also, they have a sign outside proclaiming they have been voted the best patio in Toronto... Does Toronto only have one patio? Because RL's patio is fine insofar that they do, in fact, have outdoor seating, but there's nothing especially great about it or the location. If you like to dine al fresco, then you have that option, but it's pretty bare bones/minimalist.

Rock Lobster: It's fine. You could do worse, but I'm sure you could do better too. Nothing I saw or tasted was so good that I'd go out of my way to come back, but I wouldn't kick up a fuss if someone I knew wanted to try it. But maybe next time I'll just stick to the Caesar..."}
{"text":"This is no doubt the worst restaurant I have ever been to. The waistress/owner was a rude and will make you wait for your food. I was there with a big group of 7 peoples. I have to wait for over 1hrs for my food which came out after the bills arrived. All of my friends food came overcooked and missing pieces not as stated in the menu. The food is way overprice and taste like street food for homeless, please do not go to this restaurant, it will ruined your date. Save your money and don't even try this place."}
{"text":"3.5/5. 

*the server wasn't friendly nor attentive. 

*I found Rock Lobster to be ah-okay, as we went during lobster season, and with that kind of price, the food was supposed to be superb!

*Rock lobster Caesar - $13: 
Trust me, I worked in restaurants before and they all watered down the Caesar, and the one at Rock Lobster is nothing like those tasteless versions at all! We all decided to share this as it was huge for $13, and the drink was garnished with a fresh celery and a boiled half lobster tail! The flavors here were bold and and spicy! However I was quite disappointed with the lobster tail as it was bland and over-cooked.

*Rock Lobster roll - $16 (substitute the chips with seasonal vegetables): 
For $16 I thought the roll was a bit small, however it was filled with big juicy chunks of lobster. The seasoning on the lobster was spot on, and I liked how you still can taste the fresh lobster as it wasn't overly drenched in dressings. The roll was lightly toasted and crisp, not too greasy. The corn was just a typical buttered grill corn, nothing special. 

*Lobster poutine - $15: 
It's not bad, but it's not spectacular either so don't expect too much. I didn't think the lobster made it that much better than any other poutine on the market. At least you are getting big chunks of lobster here, gravy was packed with lobster flavor and fries were crispy. But where are my cheese curds? You can't call this a poutine when there were barely any melted cheese curds...

*Lobster Boil - $22.50: 
For $22.50, this was a bit expensive. Instead of fries, we got the yukon chips on the side and wow, they were pretty much burnt and stale. At least the lobster was perfectly cooked and juicy, seasoned just right too :)."}
{"text":"I went came here for the first time after my friend was raving about it. We were seated right away and offered drinks, we both got the Rock Caesar which was delicious. As an appetizer we each got a lobster taco, they were flavourless. As an entree we shared the jerk shrimp roll, crab boil, and two lobster tails. The roll was a very small size and flavourless as well. 
I'm giving this place three stars because of the owner, he was drunk and talking to tables including ours while we were trying to enjoy our dinner. He also blasted the music to an uncomfortable volume. This place is all hype, there are way better seafood restaurants in the city. If I do go back it won't be to this location."}
{"text":"Great food! I had the Classic Maine Hot Roll and I was very satisfied with the taste. The service was really good as well. Great atmosphere with the staff and the music."}
{"text":"Would definitely go back.  Really big portion sizes, good ambience, and everything we ate was good. The fried clams were a nice treat and definitely shareable size, and the lobster Mac and cheese was outstanding. My friend enjoyed her lobster Caesar while I had the margarita and was wholly underwhelmed by it - it was weak, small, and nothing special. It was also sad because I wanted a Mojito but they were out of mint. 

In any case I will definitely return here! There are other menu items I'd want to try for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled across this little gem one Sunday afternoon and it's official. . It's on our list for lobster and other shell fish delights. . Great atmosphere and service. . The food is outstanding for a casual dining experience. . Not everyone can get creative with lobster and other shell fishy fun stuff.  Great value as well."}
{"text":"We thought the two locations had the same menu, or we definitely would have gone to the Ossington one.  (Our server said they are \"completely different\") We went on a Sunday and was looking forward to the lobster dinner, but turns out the Queen st location doesn't serve that at all.

Had the lobster roll, which was good -  tasted the sum of its parts (lobster, roll) but nothing special. The chips that came with were over cooked, like other reviewers said.  Maybe that's their way of making chips? They left a greasy taste in my mouth for hours though.  I wish there was an option for a lighter side, like coleslaw or something.  

My companion had the fish and chips.  The fish was fresh and tasty, but the batter and the fries were in the same overcooked brown state. The batter was too crispy and broke off in pieces. Fries were soggy and greasy. 

Just because the food is fried doesn't mean it should leave a greasy aftertaste.  Everyone just wants to put fried stuff on their menus, because they're such crowd pleasers, but frying food properly actually takes some skill. 

We also ordered the lobster saganaki, which was a type of cheese on a skillet, topped with lobster.  It is served with liquor poured on top (cognac? Whiskey?) and set aflamed. Bad pairing, because the cheese and the liquor tasted so strong that it covered the delicate lobster. And again, the cheese was really greasy. 

In conclusion, the prices were reasonable, beer was good, service was good. But unfortunately, the food was mediocre and the only thing memorable about my meal was the grease.  I will give the Ossington location a try, but won't be back to this one on Queen."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly came here for an early dinner with a couple friends last weekend.  I was really excited to try the food after seeing fellow foodies post pics on social media.  

Ordered a glass of wine and a couple raw oysters to start.  Since it was my first visit, i had to order the Rock Lobster Roll, which came with house-made chips and pickles.  Knowing lobster rolls were generally small, I really wanted to order the Lobster Mac & Cheese as well, but this location did not have it on the menu. Just ordered a side of fries instead to go with my roll.  

-Rock Lobster Roll: I enjoyed the lobster roll, which was on fresh, slightly toasted bread.  Some of the lobster meat could have been handled better so that the meat was more in chunks.  There were many small bits and pieces.  If you have ever tried Luke's Lobster rolls in NYC, their roll and chunks of lobster meat are perfection.  I don't know how the kitchen let the side of chips go out because they were obviously over-cooked (just look at the picture).  I didn't bother to send it back and just ate the fries which were ok.  
-Dessert:  only had one option, maple syrup stick snow.  I always like to try a dessert, especially if it is my first time at the restaurant so ordered it.  Don't bother.  Didn't enjoy it at all ($6 or $7).  Only ate a small piece.

Overall, I would come back if I had a craving for a lobster roll as not many places I know in Toronto where I can get one and in a casual setting, and maybe to try some of the other items on the menu, like the lobster mac and cheese at another location or the burger.  It is a very casual restaurant, the service was fine, and my friends said they did enjoy the lobster poutine and burger they ordered.  I was just expecting so much more and disappointed in a few too many aspects...I have to rate it a 2.5 to 3..."}
{"text":"I'd give it a 2.5 really. This place is overrated and overpriced. I have been there three times, if I wrote this review the first time I'd probably give it a 4 but the more I go to this place the less I like it. On the second visit I realized how expensive this place is, a Caesar costs you $13. 
Poutine $15 
and the food is OK, I'd honestly pick red lobster over this place."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars 
VIBE 
I may miss the nostalgia of Shanghai Cowgirl (RIP sweet potato fries, periogies and grilled cheese) but owner Matt Pettit says it best: \"When was the last time you've been there?\" It's true: I hadn't been in over a year.  Queen West before Bathurst, shockingly, doesn't have the best selection of sit down restaurants so it's nice that Pettit is making Queen West a go-to spot again. 

But, a few things: please get more than two wireless debit machines for the whole restaurant (including patio!). 
There is no designated space to go to use your debit/credit either except for the server's station and it's super disorganized, especially when it's always bustling. 
So peeps: cash is best here. 

Service is a bit slow, as well. Hopefully, this will speed up in time. If you're a deuce, you'll most likely get a stool - they're not the most comfortable but you may make a friend or two beside you at the long tables. Come early if you want a booth. 

I've only been to the Ossington location once but I think this one is a step up, with their Canadiana/instagram-worthy back patio and seafood-artistry along the walls. 

I love the idea of the take-out seafood and fish counter. Fantastic! 

WE DRANK 
Drinks first: Okay, the Caesar is fantastic BUT it's overpriced at $12 - you are paying for the lobster tail, first and foremost. I googled \"how much is a Caesar drink in Toronto?\" and got $10 at Mildred's and $3 at Lakeview so it's a bit of an extreme range. I think average prices for Caesars in this city are about $7-8 (correct me if I'm wrong). As said, you're paying for the lobster tail (but great marketing!)

A bunch of bartenders sitting near us recommended the bacon Caesar and I think it's a bit of a gimmick if you ask me. It was watered down and way to syrupy for both the tastes of my friend and me. But you do get a LOT of bacon in your Caesar if that's your thing. 

WE ATE 
I love the extension of the menu here. 
The big win is the Filet \"Eh\" fish sandwich. It is delish and you don't get the \"is this real?\" guilt like after eating the McDonald's version. It is also CHEAP at $5! 

The Lobster roll is a staple, obvs and it's gotten better with time (less mayo than its previous incarnations). Bravo.

We also had the lobster deviled eggs. I'm not a fan of the beet-coloured eggs, so I'd go for a second FIlet \"Eh\" fish instead. 

The lobster tacos were OK. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
I think there's a few kinks that need to be fixed but otherwise, this is a lively place to come--with cash in hand-- and kick back with a friend. Rock Lobster, indeed!"}
{"text":"Yay to the lobster poutine and lobster in a bread bowl! 

Nay to the lobster roll and lobster taco. 

Really enjoyed the outdoor patio in the back."}
{"text":"Going once for curiosity is enough. I wouldn't go if you wanted to eat lobster. The burger w lobster is not substantial. We had to send it back. Maybe the ceaser is the coolest. Poutine wasn't bad. But for the price and hype. Not worth it"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. Had a couple of delicious bourbon sours before dinner while we waited for a table. Only about a 15 minute wait for a 730pm on a Friday walk-in. Had a lobster tail for appetizer and the shrimp roll for dinner. The roll itself was great but I did find the fries a bit on the greasy side. Same for my husband who found his chips pretty greasy. Overall though this was a good place for what it is and would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!

Worst lobster roll I ever had.  Not only did we wait 40 minutes for our lunch but the lobster roll ($19.00 order) was terrible.  Overcooked lobster.  No flavour.  The home fries weren't very tasty except salty.  I was starving so I pretty much ate the warm roll.  Put a few extra chewy lobster chunks on the side of the basket and ate a few fries.  My co-worker had the clam chowder soup which was Luke warm.  I left hungry of course. 

Although our server was nice to discount our meals in half, we still didn't have much choice but to eat what we had or go elsewhere but our hour lunch was already up.  The server also brought us water quick and was very friendly.  

Ive had much better lobster rolls elsewhere but maybe we just had a really really really bad experience."}
{"text":"On a slow rainy Sunday evening, we decided to try Rock Lobster on the east side. The oysters were good, and Caesar was bountiful, but the claim rolls were something to be desired. Two out of the three of us got these little over-fried clam pieces, not even full strips. Maybe it was the time of year for the fresh cut potatoes (fries), but we all noticed they were a bit soggy and limp. Overall for the price, and the quality it gets a meh rating at best. Hopefully next time we won't be as disappointed this time around."}
{"text":"cozy little place - I was here for a lunch date. I don't remember a thing about my main (I think it was the lobster roll, which is in line with the other reviews), but the oysters we splurged on were incredible - complex and full flavoured, delicious. I had the caesar with the half-tail of lobster in it. perhaps a bit gimmicky but the price was right, and the drink itself was basic but serviceable.

I would go again, but I'd get a fish option - really, lobster doesn't have a whole lot of flavour. And a few more oysters too - better than dessert."}
{"text":"I've heard such good reviews but unfortunately it was a bit of a disappointment. I ordered the fish and chips $15 which was a fairly good portion, but quite greasy. Especially as the haddock was placed on top of the fries making it super oily. My friend got the lobster poutine $15 and we both do not recommend it. Not a very big portion, fries were bleh and the gravy had absolutely no taste to it. 

Service was good and replenished our water so that's good! But overall, just a very bleh experience. Perhaps the other foods are better....."}
{"text":"Came here the other day with a friend for dinner and had the Lobster Poutine ($15) and the Fried Oysters and Bacon Popcorn ($5).  The poutine's gravy and fries were really well seasoned and delicious and rich - just the way you want them to be!  The cheese curds were probably a bit too large (I know - crazy, right?) which made them far too sharp for the delicate flavor of the few lobster pieces and fries and gravy.  That said, I thought this dish overall was pretty scrumptious, albeit some small issues with the cheese, and the overall lack of lobster for the price.

In terms of the fried oysters and bacon popcorn - it's best if you just stay away.  The popcorn was overcooked and had a burnt overly crunchy-taste in the mouth, but yet despite being overcooked, there were still a TON of kernels in the basket. The fried oysters were gummy, chewy, and made me think I'd be sick the day after from how gross they were.

Plating I think was overall a major plus, service was OK at best (we ended up waiting 10+ minutes for our check), and the food was all right.  If I was in Toronto again, I'd probably go looking for a few other places to eat at before coming back here right away."}
{"text":"I've been in to Rock Lobster East a couple of times and had a young guy named Liam serve. What a great kid. Not only did we eat well, he is one hell of a bartender. He makes a wicked Negroni. Oh, and, the Lobster Roll is amazing. If you love lobster, you will be truly gratified."}
{"text":"Was here on Friday night for a launch party event. Small place, but the atmosphere is great! Delicious lobster rolls and the best mojito I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I went to Rock Lobster with my foodie friend (Toronto Foodie) as a plus one for an exclusive media event a few months ago. It was for the premiere of Super Snack Bros (a food show featuring iconic dishes with a twist!) on the Food Network. I've never been to Rock Lobster before and have heard good things about it. We got to try an array of awesome food that were featured on the show. However, the dishes served were not on the regular menu. Based on what I got to try, I am curious to come back and taste one of their main dishes since one of the hosts of the show is the chef/owner of Rock Lobster, Matt Dean Pettit (and punk rock podcaster and foodie Damian Abraham being the other host).

Rock Lobster has a very cool and laid-back vibe. It's great if you want to get some grub and beer with friends. It is a place unwind at if you don't want to take yourself too seriously."}
{"text":"Just want to update my review because over the 2 years since opening, this place now completely disappoints me.

Have been twice this year and both times: very very slow wait times to receive food, food not good, and they changed their menu and it's just not exciting anymore.

Had the lobster boil last week and the fries came out cold and the \"seasonal mixed vegetables\" was a half piece of corn on the cob. Food took 30 mins to come out despite restaurant being half full."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday mid-afternoon. People were sprinkled on the patio and not too busy. We ordered a lobster taco, a lobster roll, fish sandwich, and a diet coke.
First off, the diet coke didn't come until after the food came, and twice asked for it. Petty? Perhaps... But then when the sandwich and the roll came, no sign of the taco. Another inquiry and the taco comes out a few minutes later. Apparently a miscommunication, but how's that when it's barely busy? I don't like to put poor service on the restaurant because other servers may be great. But the food that came didn't do anything for me. Some love it, but I didn't think it was anything worth talking about. My benchmark for the roll is the shrimp po boy from the Buster Sea Cove food truck (go figure). The lobster roll didn't come close to that, on top of it being a 4 bite sandwich. The fish sandwich was also just alright, and I suppose the taco was the best of the bunch.
And of course the bill payment was another thing we had to ask for.
In the end, poor service mixed with mediocre food sums up to a poor review... Sorry.

As a side note, the hours on the website are different from their actual hours. I was sitting on the patio at 4pm and it was half full"}
{"text":"Had a rather disappointing experience here recently that left a very poor impression on me and my party. 

FOOD: Mediocre and deceiving. The meat in the lobster poutine I had was a bit tough, but tasted well enough with the melted cheese curds. The lobster taco was dry and rather tasteless, though reasonably-sized given its price ($6). The lobster macaroni and cheese in which I hoped to sample was not available, despite being listed on the website's menu.

The group I was with had much poorer luck with their food choices: 

1) The steam pot they shared ($99) was missing all of the shrimp it was supposed to have.  
2) The \"four lobster tails\" advertised in the menu were actually 2 tails, cut in half. 
3) My other friend's lobster tail was so small, it looked closer to a crayfish. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE: The mediocre and falsely advertised food was one matter, but the manner in which the server dealt with these issues was the most problematic. 

1) The waitress did eventually bring out a bowl of shrimp, but when asked about the absence of 4 lobster tails, she stated that \"technically, the lobster is in 4 pieces.\" 
2) Despite inquiries, my other friend did not receive one of the items he had ordered until AFTER our bill already arrived.
3) At the end of the meal the server automatically charged us an 18% \"large group\" gratuity, despite our only having 7 people. While I'm aware some downtown locations use this charge for groups of 6+ people, the server did not inform us ahead of time, and likely knew that she was not going to receive anything close to that high of a tip (or none at all) based on her service. 

SUMMARY: Given Rock Lobster's reputation, perhaps the other locations are more appealing. This one however, is one that I nor my friends will be returning to."}
{"text":"Went to Rock Lobster after not having been for about 10 months and was very disappointed to find out that the bucket of warm shrimp was removed from the menu.  This was easily the highlight of my last visit, as well as my friend's!  

Instead I had the Lobster taco, peel and eat shrimp, and the wedge salad.  All were good but not as succulent and mouthwatering as that shrimp. 

Fingers crossed that it's put back on the menu!"}
{"text":"Slightly overpriced and out of the way from the busier section of Queen St West, but I really enjoyed the unannoying hipster back patio environment, \"staring\" at other people's lobster tail caesars, fried clams, shrimp, cold beer, and polite service. 

Our group of 4 ordered 8 shucked oysters, but it took over 40 minutes, so we joked that they must have crossed the street to Loblaws to pick them up, then had to learn how to shuck an oyster in the kitchen. 

Good place to go if your group is just looking for a beer and a snack.

{"text":"I've been to Rock Lobster twice, once here at the Queen Street location and once at the Ossington location.  Both times it failed to connect.  The service is pretty good, and the atmosphere's casual and friendly, but I just feel like the food isn't everything it's cracked up to be.  I'm constantly on the hunt for an excellent lobster roll in Toronto - something I've yet to find - and Rock Lobster's offering is mediocre.  A beggarly portion of fresh and tender lobster with a forgettable dressing that adds little, the whole thing was underwhelming in both size and flavor.  When I eat a lobster roll, I want to be eating either big chunks of lobster with clarified butter, or the same juicy chunks of sweet deliciousness with a bit of mayonnaise, green onion, and celery.  That's how this is done, and they attempt the latter at Rock Lobster.  But the base lobster quality just didn't seem to be there.  The lobster taco's more of the same, and disappointing for the same reasons.  Maybe they keep the better lobster for the more purist dishes?  I dunno.

I'd heard good things about the Lobster Cappuccino, the Ossington-only bisque, and while the presentation and size was there, again, I felt flavor was lacking.  For six bucks it was still a great deal, I just... wish it was better?  I want to taste that lobster.  And for some reason it just ain't there.

I'm eager to try Rock Lobster again and go for the crab clusters and a lobster tail or something, but it's tough to get myself back in the door.  The food's not bad, it's just not great either, and the restaurant's rep unfortunately built my expectations kind of high.  I hope to have reason to give an updated review with more praise in the future."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed. 

Food was bland and tasteless. 
We had lobster poutine, fries in watery tasteless gravy. Lobster mac and cheese, cheese sauce was very bland and watery. 

We also ordered a kids meal, popcorn shrimp. It was a bowl of burned popcorn with a pool of greasy butter at the bottom with a few cooked tasteless shrimp on top. 

The bathrooms were gross. One toilet was loose, both were dirty and one had vomit lining the bowl. I get that is something that happens on a busy evening, but this was an empty Sunday afternoon with the staff all standing around. 

Would not go back or recommend"}
{"text":"Rock Lobster's Caesar ($12) really ROCKS!!

It is nothing like the  watered down, tasteless version I had at other places. The flavours here is bold, peppery and spicy with a punch! 

And the garnish: a huge fresh celery and half a rock lobster tail! LOVE!

I came here for a quick pre dinner drink at the bar. Sitting right in front of the raw bar with all these oysters, lobster tails and snow crabs was not easy, as I had to use all my will power to stop myself to order a dozen or so oysters... as I might ended up here with a full meal instead of meeting up with Evelyn's for her Secret Supper Club event!

Love all the staff at the bar area, they were super friendly and accommodating.

I will be back again for another Caesar or some lobster next time!!!! Steam Whistle Seafood Boil anyone?!"}
{"text":"I love seafood, I love lobster, I was in the area, so of course I had to try Rock Lobster! It's not a huge restaurant, so I guess my friends and I lucked out when we popped in randomly on a Saturday night and only had to wait about 5-10 minutes for a table to clear up. Their menu isn't very big, but there are a number of interesting looking things on it. For a group of three, we ordered: lobster poutine, lobster roll, grilled calamari, and the crab boil, and it was definitely a good amount of food.

Lobster poutine: I was excited for this, but then was a little disappointed. It's not bad, but I don't think the lobster makes it that much better than any other poutine. And to be honest, the lobster flavour just kind of gets hidden under the saltiness from the cheese and fries anyways. It's not bad, but don't expect too much.

Lobster roll: I actually liked this quite a lot, although it was just a tad salty. They put some kind of seasoning on the lobster which makes it DELICIOUS. My friend complained that the bun was too greasy for her, but I didn't mind it. This dish also comes yukon chips which taste really fresh and are addicting.

Grilled calamari: Another just-ok dish for me. It was pretty much like any other calamari/squid dish really. Would pass on this one next time.

Crab boil: This was probably the highlight of our meal. Normally I would whine about all the hard work that goes into eating crab legs - having to crack open the legs and pick out the crab meat, etc. but honestly the crab was sooooo good that I would do it again. It was so fresh and juicy, and I mean for $29 we got a BIG crab that had six... or eight... legs (whatever is normal for a crab I guess). It comes with some \"seasonal vegetables\" on the side which in our case was brussel sprouts... but which they cooked or marinated or something in this really sweet sauce. BUT IT WAS AMAZING. SO so good.

Our final bill for the night was about $92 dollars after tax and tip, which split between 3 people was like $31 each. Totally not bad for the amount of food we got, especially with the crab and all. I would probably stop by again if I was in the area! I like that the environment is very chill and laid back, with lots of cute lobster decorations."}
{"text":"Was excited to go there for sometime and finally did last night. We ordered the lobster tacos, lobster roll, jerk shrimp roll and lobster pogos. Everything was pretty flavourless except the jerk shrimp roll which was decent but the spice pretty much overpowered the whole dish. The tacos just tasted like eating a corn tortilla shell with lettuce in it. The pogos were nothing special and the lobster roll was okay but lacked any real flavour. After hearing great things about this place I was extremely disappointed in the food. Not worth another visit. The service was good and our server was friendly which saved some face but not going to make me go back ever again."}
{"text":"Came here on Boxing day for dinner with my boyfriend and we both enjoyed it a lot... So much so that he ordered me delivery on our anniversary while he was in Boston! 

For our dinner we ordered:
- Fried Clams - Never tried this before and were very pleasantly surprised!
- PEI Mussels - The sauce was excellent, and mussels fresh.
- Scallop Carbonara - The scallops were tasty and sweet. The pasta and sauce were good and not too heavy. 
- Lobster Caesar - Loved the Caesar! The lobster tail itself tasted a little bland tho. 

My bf got me a Classic Lobster Boil Platter with salad and brussel sprouts for delivery. Everything was perfect :)"}
{"text":"Really not a great experience. We were very excited to try the lobster poutine, among other items. Everything fell flat flavour wise, really could have done a better job at home."}
{"text":"My friends and I finally got to try this place after months of drooling over our friends pictures. While taking a look at the menu, we were offered coat check to give ourselves more dining space which I found really nice.

We ordered the lobster roll and the surf and turf burger. Upon receiving the lobster roll, I was thrown back realizing the lobster was served cold on the toasted bread bun. The surf and turf burger and fries on the other hand was a hit. 

Overall I found that the food was a bit overpriced and unfortunately, nothing really stood out to me personally."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere , but unfortunately the hype didn't meet the expectation . Unfortunately I won't be going there again ."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars in my book. They make a pretty good Bloody Caesar, but their $18 Mac & Cheese simply didn't cut it - especially at that price. I had way better Mac & Cheese during my time at Pelican Bay State Prison - quick shoutout to my homeboy Terrell!!! see you when you get out..."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with different friends and all my experiences were great.

The staff were very nice and attentive, and the service was fast. The food is good and it's cool to see the different dishes they can make with lobster. 

The first time I went I ordered the rock lobster caesar. It had a big lobster tail sticking out, loved it!

I've ordered the lobster roll a couple of times. It's delicious but kind of a small portion. I've also tried the lobster poutine numerous times. It's a cool concept with lobster but a little bland tasting. 

Today I went in the afternoon and ended up getting the Lobster Benny on the brunch menu. It was very good but a little soggy and the hollandaise sauce tasted kind of buttery.

Overall a good restaurant and I'd definitely come back but I would love to try the Ossington location because I hear the menu is different and has things on it like lobster mac and cheese, jerk shrimp etc."}
{"text":"I heard of these guys soooo many times now, I was lucky to see them at an event on Yonge Dundas square. It was $4 for that lobster roll (it was half the size of the restaurant's lobster roll) LOADED with lobster. It was amazing and so I was extremely excited to learn of their restaurant location.

SO FINALLY I visited with a friend. 

$14 Lobster Poutine
$14 Lobster Roll

Unfortunately the roll was just toast + lobster (and was so small!!) with potato chips. It was way too expensive for the size of this, although delicious... it wasn't spectacular. In fact I wouldn't order this again.

The poutine was FANTASTIC. Lobster is already quite strong in flavor, so to be mixed with gravy... for some reason it was an amazing blend. I was thinking about it all night and the next day. SOOO YUMMYY

Our server was very attentive and checked up on us quite often. It was a Tuesday 7pm dinner, we stayed until 9:30 and the restaurant was busy (not packed) but we didn't feel pressured to leave. 

Love the diner decor, decorated chalkboards downstairs, coat rack in the back... tables are quite close together, our neighbour's butt almost spilled our glass of water.

The caesar (with the lobster tail!!!!) on the neighbour's table had a pretty big lobster tail!! Definitely will try next time."}
