{"text":"So the old Dragon Silver was better. The food have flavor and it was great.  Now the new silver Dragon.   The food is plain with no taste at all.  And plus the order was wrong.  
I wasted my money on flavorless food"}
{"text":"Last night first time visit to New Silver Dragon , I was hoping it would be as good as old, well guess what, its BETTER, food delicious , staff outstandingly friendly, will definitely repeat."}
{"text":"First time here. As soon as I walked in I was greeted by the nicest lady. She made suggestions but wasn't pushy. Since it was the first time eating there I took her up on the suggestion of tasty fried rice and sweet and sour chicken. The meal was delicious and authentic. The rice had shrimp, chicken, and bbq pork; a load of each. Best part was that the shrimp was clean on both sides. Will be back."}
{"text":"I think I found my go to Chinese food place. I'm not sure what/how it tasted before, but I'm pretty satisfied with my food. Quick, yummy and not bad pricing :)"}
{"text":"Food has improved  from their initial opening . Their portions are large. Food is on the salty side. Tried the egg rolls again  still very oily . Tried their seafood tufu soup.  Salty with too much corn starch.  They did put a lot of tutu.  Mongolian beef was the best dish that I tried.owners are friendly"}
{"text":"Twice now my husband and I have had excellent food at New Silver Dragon via takeout! The food is always fast, fresh, exactly as ordered, tasty and never too salty. When you want it spicy, emphasize it. They aim to take care if you every time, actually taking the time to get to know us. There are lots of seating options inside and the place is spotless. While they don't have delivery, it would be a great place to take a group as they have 3 large rounds with rotating centers for easy sharing. 

Our favorite dishes so far:
Szechwan chicken
Pot stickers
Egg rolls
Green beans (you can order them without meat!)
Fried rice
Sweet and sour chicken

I highly recommend this place for delicious, fast Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese Cuisine is as uncommon as rain in Central Arizona.

It's slowly becoming obvious that many of our favorite haunts are slowly becoming extinct. We've been patronizing Silver Dragon since it's days when it was still by 19th avenue and Dunlap, before the light rail station was built.

It was a stalwart fixture within that neighborhood, and even though it was out of my way, I always made it a point to stop by for takeout.

Imagine our surprise when Silver Dragon closed, and the New Silver Dragon opened under new management and new menus.

When we first arrived, the VERY first thing I noticed was the noticeable absence of the Chinese menu. What happened to my Salt & Pepper pork chops? Where's my fried noodles? Why is this menu so small, and mostly in English?

No, I don't speak Chinese yet! But, I can sure read and pronounce the delicacies that I have come to love over the years.

Annie, our server (and maybe the owner?) saw how perturbed I was. She tried her best to allay my discontent regarding what was missing on their new menu. 

She suggested alternatives that we could try, and so we did.

I was hesitant about ordering, and wanted to walk out. But, her kind demeanor seemed to quiet down my dissatisfaction.

We ordered the Beef & Mushroom, Singapore Rice Noodles, Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings, and the Pot stickers.

To be fair, I will rate this Cantonese Style Cuisine based on its own merits rather than an unfair, and seemingly biased palate expectation.

The Pot Stickers were quite mediocre. We normally like ours more deeply Pan Fried, rather than glossed over. These didn't taste quite as well done as we would like.

The Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings were flavorful, but had nothing special about them. It's just chicken wings that is slightly salted and has batter. That's it.

The notable exceptions were the Singapore Rice Noodles, and the Beef & Mushroom dishes. The Singapore Rice Noodles were quite appetizing, as the noodles were properly prepared. And the addition of the various meats enhanced the already rich flavor of the dish.

The Beef & Mushroom had amazing mushrooms, and fresh snow peas. We love snow peas, especially, if they are properly prepared and cooked through and through. Some places under cook them, and they wind up tasting raw and inedible. This dish was a great surprise to us.

All in all, the New Silver Dragon may not be a comparable replacement to its former glory. But, rated on its own merits, is quite an acceptable Chinese food establishment."}
{"text":"Original Silver Dragon was way better I hate to say. Mushy egg rolls and just funky tasting S & S shrimp. Bring back the old chef."}
{"text":"The New Silver Dragon restaurant is not the same as the original Silver Dragon. No special Chinese menu. Nothing special at all anymore. All my favorites were gone. The best thing I can say about it is that the ingredients were fresh and service was with a smile."}
{"text":"So glad they are up an running again.  Very clean and friendly.  Our faves are the shrimp fried rice, Mongolian beef and potstickers.  

The hours have improved and they are bow opened 7 days from 11 am to 9 pm.

Family owned and. As I left a kid on a bike told me it was better than Panda!  Loved it!

Another great sign for us is when you see the place packed with other asian families.  A sign that this is not only authentic but a community oriented place."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good Chinese restaurant and this is it! Great food. Very clean and lovely service. We highly recommend !"}
{"text":"I ate here when it was just Silver Dragon and did not enjoy the food...... so I decided to give it a 2nd chance when I saw they new owners.... I think.....or maybe just a new name...
Today' after I placed my order.....the lady at the counter went in the kitchen and one by one the all came bout to look at me......WTF....that was weird...
Sesame Chicken was ok... But it was OLD CHICKEN......."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I went there based on the reviews. I did take out and loved the Walnut Shrimp. They were very nice and even added some almonds to the top of my chicken dish at no charge.  While I was waiting for my order I was going to purchase a bottle of water and they gave it to me for free!
I read the previous reviews about the previous location and owners but I never went there and am happy with my choice to try this place. 
I wish I had taken pics but was just too hungry!!"}
{"text":"As the name implies, this is the New Silver Dragon (new owner/management).  This is not the original that started at 19th Avenue & Dunlap.  The menu has changed significantly in the sense that they have minimized the Chinese menu down to only some noodle & dumpling dishes.  Personally, I cannot comment on what was on the Americanized version before to what is there now.  I still ordered off the shortened Chinese menu... I had the Beef Chow fun and the Soy Sauce Noodles.  Both were ok.  The Beef chow fun was a little darker than I would like but still very flavorful and not greasy; it's not an easy dish to cook.  The soy sauce noodles, were not as crispy as I would like and they do had some curry in the sauce too...so that was a nice touch.  Since this is way on the other side of town for me, I would only dine here again, if I am in the area, like today.  The staff was friendly, I believe the waitress was the owner as well and I believe the younger guy was a nephew, if I understood correctly.  The place is clean and spacious."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my visit to New Silver Dragon. The restaurant was clean and the service was friendly and quick. We ordered mapo tofu and vegetable lo mein (we eat a plant-based diet). The serving sizes were very generous and both were delicious-- but especially the lo mein which was the best lo mein we've ordered and enjoyed at any other Chinese restaurant. I had never visited the old Silver Dragon due to their hours being so wacky so I can't offer any opinion on how it compared to previously, but we found it delicious and affordable and will be back."}
{"text":"Best Cantonese food in the area. 

The owner of Silver Dragon retired, but this new owner was a friend of his and took over the business under the rebranded name \"New Silver Dragon\". The stock menu doesn't have much different from standard American-Chinese food, but they have a \"special menu\" (uploaded) and can customize a fair bit if you have a specific request. On my first time, I got:

1. Niu nan bao: this is similar to their Special Menu \"Beef Stew Noodle Soup\", except I got it on a bed of bok choy instead of noodle. Chewy, tender and flavorful chunks of beef & tendon.

2. Cantonese chow mein: this is actually on their stock menu, an assortment of meat & vegetable on a bed of crispy fried yellow noodles. In Mandarin, we call this liang mian huang. The BBQ pork is nice and tender, and the noodles as crispy as they're supposed to be (the part in the sauce always gets soft, which is normal).

3. Green beans with garlic sauce: probably similar to the stock menu's Green Bean with Black Bean Sauce. Beans had the appropriate amount of crunch, sauce was savory without being overpowering.

Next time, I'm going to get the Walnut Shrimp and maybe their Duck fried rice. I'd love to get some of the fish options from the old Silver Dragon, like Salt & Pepper Fish or Fish Hot Pot. They said they might start offering those if there's enough interest, so please ask for me!"}
{"text":"I ordered the egg foo young and it was covered with some brown gravy type sauce! Very strange and gross... Nasty food, nice owner! Won't be going back..."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite Chinese places to eat!  Prices are on que, the place is clean, the people were so heartfelt friendly, food is amazing and there's a lot of it! I have to take half of it home each time please know I am going through chemo and deal with a lot of stuff but when I go out on a good Chinese place this is the one I prefer!
Five stars my friends!"}
{"text":"This place is like most in the Phoenix area, Unser seasoned and so Americanized you cant really describe it as Chinese food.  Chinesesque maybe.   If you like authentic prepared food, this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"The Honey Walnut Shrimp is amazing!  The people are wonderfully friendly.  Prices are reasonable, and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"A fellow Yelper said 15 days ago, that New Silver Dragon's food, is not as good as it once was......I challenge to differ. I have ordered, from the New Menu, on 3 different occasions. The food was amazing. My latest order, was The Pork with Green Beans, with the request, to have the white rice, stir fried. The dish consisted of tender pork slices, stir fried with green string beans, sliced carrots & onions, in a dark slightly sweet/pepper sauce. I ate every bit of it. Also, the staff was very friendly and inviting. This location, has the option to dine-in or carry out. There's also, a lunch menu, that is available Monday - Sunday: 11 am to 3 pm. TOTALLY YUMM!!"}
