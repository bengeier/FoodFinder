{"text":"New cafe opened by the owner of a fitness studio in town.  Healthy food at a great price.  Had a breakfast sandwich this morning and got a free oatmeal cookie for stopping in.  Not only is their food healthy and fresh, they also have several vegetarian and vegan items on the menu.  This is huge for a town that is made up of fast food, pizza and family style restaurants.  I finally have an option instead of having to cook all my meals myself.  Oh, she also has great smoothies!!"}
{"text":"It was our first time..They promised us a free cookie...I guess the ditzy blonde cashier forgot..That was ok though, it was just a cookie. My dad had 'the kicker' burger. Halfway through, he cried out \"I'm eating paper!\" The girl had forgotten to take the paper off the slice of cheese. I am not sure about the nutritional value of paper, but I wouldn't want to eat it..I had the artichoke hummus wrap...it was too watery! I just wish the staff would have spent less time gossiping and just a little attention to what they were doing.."}
{"text":"SOFE has such an amazing alternative menu for people who like the taste of fast food, but want to eat healthy. My favs are the Salmon Burger and the Peach Mango Smoothie! The service is fast and friendly! Tanya is the owner and she's so friendly! This is a cash only establishment though."}
