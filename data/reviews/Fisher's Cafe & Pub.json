{"text":"Yesterday 7/03/2015 was the worst experience I've had at this place.  Yes my daughter and I expected it to be crowded - first nice day in a long time here in Ohio - the beginning of a holiday weekend, etc.  When we first got there we were told up to 30 minute wait - so we thought not bad.  After about 20 minutes I started noticing tables opening up, but people not being seated.  Went inside to inquire - I was told they ran out of silverware and the owner said no seating until they had time to wash the silverware, etc.!  Are you kidding me!  I asked, \"Can't we get seated and order drinks at least?\"  I was told, \"No, the owner wants nobody to be seated!\"  I have never heard of anything so absurd!  Many people were leaving and going across the street to the Winking Lizard - they were all pretty disgusted!  But we hung in there - after about a total wait time of one hour - we were seated!  After ordering our drinks - my daughter said her drink came in a dirty glass!  The waitress was very apologetic and switched it out for her.  We've always enjoyed Fisher's but never have experienced a time like this especially at the beginning of summer.  If this is an indication of the road they will be traveling down - I believe they will certainly drive away business!"}
{"text":"Overflow for the Winking Lizard, which is across the street. I went there for breakfast a couple times.. sucked. How do you F-up breakfast?! Rest is just bar food. Atmosphere is.. well, a diner."}
{"text":"Wow, Wow, Wow!  Had the Dole Pineapple Soft Serve.  It's amazing!! I remember it from Disney World.  It's like eating a pineapple right off the tree!  Also good that it's lactose free & vegan.  Today, they had Mango."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars. We sat outside on the patio in July, which was fairly nice. I don't think I'd want to sit inside. They had a very large menu with lots to choose from. We ordered the red pepper hummus, which was pretty good. The man got the Raider burger which he made disappear fairly quickly, so he must have liked it well enough. I ordered the California chicken sandwich, which I thought tasted good. I was excited to try the eggplant fries, since I like eggplant and didn't want French fries. They were a tad greasy for me, but I thought they tasted good with the Wasabi Cucumber sauce. The food came fast and service was good. 

Suggestions for improvement would be to remove the yellow placemat menus from the tables when we were eating and have to servers dress up a little bit more. Like in jeans or jean shorts with the t-shirts. They looked like they were all in workout clothes and it distracted me from my food. After getting a look from the man whom I was dictating to, he added my commentary \"It's my review, and that's how I feel.\" Yep.

The bill seemed a little high for sandwiches at lunchtime, but it was very convenient with a visit to scenic Peninsula and a ride on the scenic railroad. Overall, I would go back and try it again one more time. And yes our server thanked us for coming (regarding another yelper's comment.)"}
{"text":"Does anyone know if the mussels are still good? I heard they serve 'em up right but wasn't sure if that was a dated rumor.

Other than that, it's nice and quiet to watch a game on weekend afternoon."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is good, and the menu is varied. And their daily special page adds to that variety.  Service is always friendly. Went there hoping for Mac and Cheese, which I mistakenly believed was last night's special, but ended up ordering their stew and biscuits -- equally comforting on a cold Ohio night. My friend had the crab leg special -- $9.99 for a pound of legs, butter and garlic bread. She shared one, so I lucked out and got to have beef and seafood!

We visit often, especially in the summer, due to the restaurant's proximity to the Towpath. Their patio is a lovely place to cool down with a beer after a bike ride. 

And they also have plenty of parking -- a plus since the area gets quite crowded during warm weather."}
{"text":"Great family owned bar. Goes back generations. Great burgers, fries, onion rings.  Beautiful Cuyahoga River Valley and National Park surrounds.  Go for a long hike or bike trip and then fatten up with a burger, rings and a beer."}
{"text":"Ok, servers may be a little uneducated, but the food here is A+ especially for the price. Salmon is amazing, tried strawberry spinach salad- fabulous. Great egg plant fries. Everyone that's tried their food in my party loved it. Great value! Fair atmosphere, servers."}
{"text":"My hubby and I love Fishers! We're from Cincinnati and come to this area often. We make it a point to come here a few times whenever we're in the area. Best chili and burgers ever, love the employees and atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Went here after a ride on the towpath and was looking forward to having one of their great burgers, or what used to be great burgers. 
They obviously changed their burger recipe. Now the burgers are half the size, half the meat quality and no seasoning. Dry, tasteless, previously frozen, unseasoned, perfectly formed commercial, low quality meat patty. The only thing that was the same was the price. 
Very disappointed, We wont be back again.  Too bad, was a great place. 
Also, the server got the order wrong and when my wife said thats not what I ordered, she says, yes, it is and left."}
{"text":"Can you say slower than a turtle. Plenty of staff just wandering around. I will never return"}
{"text":"Tried this place again yesterday. The last time we visited our wait person was awful. We had the same experience. The waitress didn't write down our order. She came back to our table and asked again because she forgot. When we got our food my husband received fries instead of onion rings. When he mentioned it to the waitress, she just shrugged and said sorry we're busy. She didn't offered to replace them. It's a shame. The food is very good."}
{"text":"Stopped in from out of town to visit friends so stopped in and found this nice local place.
Had the strip steak which was good and came with large potato and salad. Drinks at bar were good and bartender, Tracy, was very nice and informed us of all their specials coming up."}
{"text":"It looks like a cool place to eat in the area, but the food is just disgusting! I had the burger and it was grayish in color and the hash and corn beef was out of can with little chunks of corn beef! I will never go here again!"}
{"text":"Restaurant Inspections from the health department are available for public reading. See Summit county website."}
{"text":"Fishers is a decent restaurant located in Peninsula right by the river. The restaurant itself is not very large and has nursing home wallpaper. Before I dive deeper into the review, I've got to say that Fishers is only good for breakfast. Lunch and dinner and underwhelming. There is rarely a wait and service is good and quick. They have a good breakfast menu. It's nothing special, but it's your standard breakfast fare, which you can never go wrong with. I had the french toast and a side of bacon. The bacon is nice and greasy, just the way I like it. The french toast was good, although there wasn't enough of it, at least for me. Overall, if you're looking for breakfast in the Valley, consider Fishers. It's good, solid breakfast fare."}
{"text":"The parking lot was full of cars, the bike racks were full of bikes. After pedaling twelve miles from downtown Akron, we were ready for a leisurely late lunch. It's the last Saturday of summer, sunny but cool. Apparently everyone wants to sit on the patio because we got seated quickly inside. Out of eleven tables, five were empty. After a long wait to get a visit from the waitress we got some waters and then another 20 minute or so wait we ordered our sandwiches. A Greek wrap for my wife and a black bean burger with added grilled mushrooms and eggplant fries for me. The food came in about 20 more minutes-a Greek wrap and a bacon burger!!! Delivered by another server, not our waiter. 15 or 20 more minutes and the black bean burger finally arrived as ordered. It was very good. The eggplant fries were ok. They were very mushy, like eggplant, with a tempura like coating. My wife said the Greek wrap was good. The waiter apologized profusely and often, she had heard my order correctly but thinks she entered it wrong in the computer-black bean burger is right next to bacon burger on the touch screen. Too many \"B\"s all together, I guess. The manager removed the cost of the black bean burger from our check without any request from us. Overall the food was tasty, the wait staff very harried even though half the tables were unoccupied, and very long intervals to receive any attention. Other tables that were seated around the same time as us also had very long waits for service."}
{"text":"Wife and I went with another couple.Everyone's food was very good.our waitress,Christina was very nice.Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Fisher's is a great little place right in the heart of Peninsula. The service is super friendly, the food is great, and their prices are very affordable. I got a pulled pork sandwich, an appetizer, and a beer for slightly under 20 bucks total, which was pretty awesome especially considering that the portions were huge. Every time I go to Fisher's, I'm very satisfied with the food and the service, and they are very deserving of a five star rating. Also, if you go there and the weather is nice, I highly recommend that you eat on their nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Went to Peninsula to walk the park and ate at Fisher's.  Really good experience - staff was friendly, food was delicious (they had several very healthy choices), and the service was fast.

Eating outside on the patio was certainly a bonus!  We will be back again no doubt."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the pits. The food was served cold. The order was incorrect and the waitress was nasty about changing it. My daughter order a fish sandwich,  the fish was mushy, it let an oil slick in her mouth. I ordered a Blt, the bread was barely toasted, they did not bother to put mayo on the sandwich. We received no refills on our drinks. It took 20 minutes to hunt down the waitress and get the check. For $47 I expect the food to be palatable. Will never go back. The kitchen was filthy. I am praying we don't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"It's very sad that a restaurant located in the middle of The Cuyahoga Valley National Park has only one thing going for it, it's in the middle of The Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Instead of serving fresh, local food (there are organic farms throughout the valley) they serve frozen, fried, food that represents the worst of bad pub fare.  I think the only thing fresh is the lettuce. I've been there several times always hoping that it will be better, but it seems to get worse.  For breakfast count on frozen, deep fried home fries, eggs that are cooked \"whatever\" (I sent my over easy egg back because the yolk was hard) and omelets that taste like they are pre-cooked and microwaved (for $8.95).  I'm not sure what's going on between the kitchen and the wait staff because service is very slow and spotty.   Lastly, this place is filthy (dirty carpets, a display case that looks like it's never been cleaned and a kitchen you don't want to look in when you walk back to the dirty bathrooms) and smells like a greasy spoon.  I don't think this place will ever change. They are one of only two restaurants in Peninsula (water issues prohibit opening more) so it's either them or the Winking Lizard.  There is no competition so unless the health department makes them improve or people stop going, they have no incentive to clean up and improve the food.   We have so many talented chefs in the area who believe in serving fresh, local food it would be nice if one of them bought this place and turned it into a showcase for all the bounty available in the valley."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate dinner here on a Thursday evening. They have a nice selection of beers.  We told our waitress we were in a bit of a hurry and she stayed on top of our needs. The food was very good. French fries were crispy on the outside. I tried the eggplant fries, which I'd never seen before, and they were delicious."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our lunch here very much after visiting Cuyahoga national park. We had a lovely and very attentive server Jessica T. We tried a new appetizer, homemade potato chips dusted with dry ranch rub and served with a Texas 'boom boom' sauce! Fabulous and addicting! California sandwich with chicken, avocado, and cilantro aioli was really good! Hubby got chicken portobello and pepper sandwich on a kaiser bun with really fun and tasty eggplant fries with a cucumber and wasabi sauce! The service really was excellent, but the menu is really too big with way too many selections! It is a local family owned business versus a chain, which we liked.  Located very central in the park and we liked the choice of eating outside or in!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been here in a while, fisher's had really improved.  Great pub food and specials.  Try the eggplant fries."}
{"text":"Decent.

The service is very friendly in this place. I was immediately turned on by the small-town appeal.  Plus, it's a diner! It's hard to find a real diner (like with a counter and pie displays and everything), let alone a good one.

I really wish we had made it in time for breakfast, because the menu looked great. Lunch was okay, but disappointing in general. We expected the eggplant fries to be a hit, but they were soggy, mostly batter, and had a funky taste. The bistro sauce looked like McDonald's special sauce...which is actually a compliment coming from me. Too bad it didn't taste like it! Nor did it taste good.

I had a salad with a bunch of healthful ingredients, yet somehow it didn't really taste all that refreshing. The grilled chicken, while flavorful, seemed awfully sweet--as if seasoned with cinnamon sugar. The candied walnuts, which SHOULD have been sweet, tasted burnt and strange. The fruit and greens were nice, but the edges of the plate were drizzled in some kind of super-sweet raspberry sauce--reminiscent of IHOP pancake syrup. Again, oddly, a compliment, but somewhat out of place here.

Hubby had a breaded chicken sandwich with big onion rings and more of the not-so-special sauce. A big fried mess.

Hope to return for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Fisher's is a nice place to hangout for a while when visiting this small little town on outskirts of Cleveland and Akron alike. I think this place has a certain charm and that is why I am a fan. 

The food is average american food with some influences from local middle eastern population. Nothing special if you are looking for specialty food. 

Ambiance is nice. Outside sitting is there for summer. Train station and other tourist destinations are there too. So if you are looking for a nice day trip this can be a perfect location for a stop and lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious onion rings and bistro sauce!  Skip the chicken sandwiches.  They are more pan fried than grilled--disappointing.  The wraps are very good, especially the asian wrap.  Fun outdoor patio in the summer.  They seem to have a killer breakfast menu so we'll have to go back and give that a try.  We usually stop at Fisher's after a bike ride along the Towpath, and there are bike racks in the parking lot."}
{"text":"You know this has been a Pennisula staple since I can rememer my parents taking me here! In the heart of a small town intersection is great Fisher's Cafe and Pub. Sectioned off you can be seated in the family lounge area for dinner or the sports bar loung area to get a few brews in you. Fisher's is the place because they offer full lobster boils and awesome clam bakes! Great during harvest season!!! Line out the door to get one of these precious seats."}
{"text":"I went here with my family on a Monday night. While the patio was pretty nice the inside just looked kinda dingy. We got there and the server was just so blah. She never smiled, she only asked us what we wanted to drink and what we wanted to eat. Literally. 
She never told us the specials, never suggested anything. We waited alot. After she took our drink order, she had someone drop or drinks off and then that was it. No one told us that she would be right back to take our order, that our server was a little busy, she would be right with us, nothing. If she was busy, I would totally understand and she may have been, but no one told us anything, no one smiled, she never once hustled, or made it look like she was busy. After she took our order, we waited again for our food. The food was pretty good. But it was just a completely lack luster experience with both the service and the interior inside, I probably would never go again."}
{"text":"Decided to try after a day spent on the towpath. Larger menu than what I was expecting for bar/pub fair, but there were not a lot of lighter choices after a hot day cycling. Tried the simple turkey club wrap which was delicious due to the spicy red pepper mayo. French fries were very hot and crispy. I would also recommend the eggplant fries with the cucumber wasabi dipping sauce if you like the taste of horseradish. However, the speed of food service was terrible. I understand they were busy and our server apologize several times for the delay, but in general the service seemed chaotic and disorganized."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way home awesome pub burger and to die for fries .. we'll be back, thank you Vicky for being a great waitress"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in this area doing the Boston Mills Arts Festival.  It was late and we were hungry so stopped in for late dinner. Really pleasantly surprised! We both had the barbecue specials they were cooking on the grill outside. Wonderful fresh chicken and ribs. The grilled veggies were well seasoned and had a nice Smokey flavor. The corn on the cob was also cooked on the grill and delicious. So much so we went back the next night. The only thing I would like to see is an update on the interior . I'm going to guess late 80's or early 90's??? I forgave them because my dinner was delicious...."}
{"text":"Great lunch at Fisher's today! My friend and I both enjoyed their Beef Stew & Biscuits ($6.99), along with a glass of cabernet wine ($6.00). As always, their stew was fantastic, but I was a bit disappointed that the wine was almost as much as the stew.."}
{"text":"Good menu. Kids had burgers and loved them. My son had the A1 burger and said it was one of the best he ever had. My daughter had the applewood bacon and liked it a lot. The onion rings were amazing. My sister had the wings with their signature Firecracker sauce and said they were really good. The California chicken club was good, but the chicken was a little dry. I would come again for the location definitely."}
{"text":"Service was awful. We expected a wait. We were told 15 min.  But after 30 mins of looking at the same 5 empty tables, I asked if we could sit at one to wait for our name. The girl said no, if you sit at one you won't be served at all. I said what?? She said we are understaffed & nobody sits there. I told her to take our name off."}
{"text":"This place is a perfect stop on a nice day, especially if you've been biking or rode the train in to Peninsula. We sat on the patio and though the drink menu had some good looking sangrias and beers, we skipped drinks. 

I got the green chicken sandwich with fries and my fiancé got the Raider burger. It was probably true biggest burger I've ever seen, with onion rings and fries on it. It was fun to read the history of the place and some of their dishes. The raider burger was named after the guy's son, a University of Mount Union football player, hence the name raider burger.  I went to Mount myself so that was a fun little tidbit to learn! Personally, I loved the fries that came with my sandwich. They're that fresh breaded, thick cut type that you can tell were hand battered and just dipped. 

We split a piece of key lime pie for dessert because it looked so good on the menu. I was a little disappointed because it didn't come like the picture, no whipped cream or syrup drizzle. I've only had key lime pie a handful of times so I don't have much to compare it to, but it seemed just okay  

Service was good all around. The inside is quite small, not sure if I'd enjoy the dining experience as much in there.  We plan to come back on our motorcycle or with our bikes to ride the trail!"}
{"text":"Arrived from California and went straight to Fisher's for casual dinner outside.  Very cute restaurant in a really cute village atmosphere.  Knew we were in trouble when I opened the menu and there was crusted food and drink all over it.  I was horrified!  Filthy.  I have never ever seen a menu like this.  Then the waitress showed up -  Tani.  Unfortunately, as we  were seated and she was standing my eyes went directly to the filty food crusted black apron she was wearing.  I am now very uneasy about the lack of any cleanliness in this restaurant.  We overheard her telling someone she was a manager there.  Om my - really??  My friend ordered the special clam bake - I the ribs.  It took an hour to get our food.  She wasn't good at checking in with us and when My friend had to ask for her sides and more bread it took forever for her to return.  I asked for another glass of wine which she never brought me.  I had to go into the bar and get it myself.  Oh - and when I asked the bartender for another glass of Sterling  she responded that they have been out of that for quite a while.  Tani never mentioned that when she delivered my white wine.  Anyone's guess what I was drinking.  I must say between the filthy conditions and the awful service I don't know how they stay in business.  Maybe the location and quaintness.   My ribs were nothing special and very very fatty.  I was up in the middle of the night with an upset stomach.  Very dissapointing as my friend was so excited to take me there.  Never ever again."}
{"text":"Terrible waitress. Slow. Attitude problem. Winking lizard was packed so we have to go here. Now I know why this place is empty and winking lizard is packed. And why does the owner have seven girls working standing around talking when the place is empty. Sheesh."}
{"text":"Really loved the food. The staff is either douchey or haggard but the food is yummy. Try the homemade cream soda!!!"}
{"text":"Looks can be deceiving. This place doesn't have the prettiest atmosphere or decor, but it truly is awesome. The service was excellent, the food was surprisingly fantastic and the beers were delicious. A great stop to make after a long day of hiking in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. I can't wait to come back here in the summer and lounge on their patio!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped for a light lunch while touring the area. He had the spinach salad with chicken and bacon dressing. I had the Lock 59 spinach salad (which has strawberries and mandarin oranges on it) with grilled shrimp and raspberry dressing. Both were exceptional. Everything is fresh and the dressings are home made. Our waitress was very pleasant and engaging. All around great experience!"}
{"text":"After a 12 mile bike ride on the towpath, I was initially thinking of the \"Winking Lizard\", but my biking partner suggested Fishers Cafe instead. I was a little hesitant, as my dinner there a month earlier had a chalkboard that boasted \"Burgers grilled outside\", but what I actually received was a partially pre-cooked burger that was finished on an outside grill. Since we both wanted a dinner salad, she encouraged me to give it a try, and to stay away from the burgers! I'm glad she did. The fact that they have their own parking lot, with ample space, and the fact that they have a very nice outdoor seating area, sealed the deal!
The food was a delight! I had the Caesar Salad with shrimp and it was delicious: perfectly grilled shrimp, (actually looked like they had been cooked on skewers outside) and good greens and dressing. My friend had the Caesar with Salmon and pronounced it very good as well. Service was warm and attentive and there was no rush to order or leave the table. I will plan on dining here after my next run or bike trip in Penninsula."}
{"text":"Casual pub with a nice patio in the summer. Great location by the Towpath Trail and Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railway. Food is good and reasonably priced. Love their eggplant fries, cheap crab legs, ribs and more."}
{"text":"We had lunch on the patio here on July 15. There appeared to be three different menus for lunch (one for the special of the day, a chicken gyro, another for the full multi-page menu, and a third sheet of paper for items that...seemed indeterminate..), which made ordering initially a little confusing. I tried the \"signature\" chili as an appetizer. If you like ketchup, you'll love their chili (I don't and I didn't). Next I had their Avacado BLT, which was generously portioned with bacon (!!) and quite tasty. 

One note to diners with walkers or wheel chairs - it is next to impossible to maneuver around the outside patio area."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped for lunch while biking on towpath. There is a very nice patio outside with a bar inside and out. The chicken curry wrap was excellent. But, we had no utensils, had to ask for a napkin, and there was no ice in the ice tea. The saddest part was that there were 5 TVs and no one knew how to change the channel of one of them to the World Cup soccer match. Instead we had to watch cheerleading championships. Maybe no one in Ohio is a soccer fan! So if you are looking for a sports bar, this isn't it, but the food is good."}
{"text":"We had their Wednesday 14.99 1.25 lb lobster special. it was very good and well worth the money. they have lots of interesting craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"Good food, nice ambiance.. Love their egg-plant fries and black bean burger !!"}
{"text":"This place was terrible.

Have always seen the parking lot filled, and there was a wait when we went there, so we expected with all the interest that it would be good.

There was a short wait, but a table opened up quickly.  Once seated it took over ten minutes before our server ever first introduced herself.  We ordered drinks and appetizers, then it took another 15-minutes after that before we ever got an order in.  Come on, that's ridiculous.

We then learn that the appetizer order was never entered.  God, I wish it wasn't, because when the baked pretzel bits arrived, we quickly realized these were microwaved-frozen pretzel bits.  That looked exactly like the Soft Baked brand from Sam's club.  They were served extremely hot, and it was clear they were microwaved as some were still stuck together.

About 15-20 minutes after that the main entrees finally arrived, and they weren't much better.  As my lovely wife described, \"it looks like your sandwich was run over,\" and it did.  The bun was either super flimsy, or someone in the heart of the house thought it would be funny to smash it with their AF1s.

At one point I had to ask for a refill.  The server grabbed my cup from the table to refill it, leaving me parched.  That's bush league.  Grab a fresh glass and bring it to the table, then swap out the empty one.

Their chicken was surprisingly fresh tasting, and perfectly cooked, but their fries were a major disappointment.  They were clearly frozen, and they had an unnatural starchy coating that were devoid of flavor.  Seriously, it's cheaper and more effective for a restaurant to simply use fresh potatoes for their fries...I can't believe any restaurant would let anything other than fresh fries out of their kitchen.  I won't in my own home kitchen, so why would they?

As we walked out my wife said perhaps they appear busy because they get so many people that can't get a table across the street at the Winking Lizard.  God, I hope that's not true.  That's so sad that the best a restaurant can do is pick up the scraps from the Lizard."}
{"text":"Food: Very good
Service: Excellent
Ambience: Very good

This place looks and feel like a local watering hole in the Midwest. The servers are friendly and polite and attentive. It was a crowded Saturday afternoon and we walked in with a large group and they were so accommodating. They have outdoor seating and live music outside. 
I loved their eggplant fries and they are a must have. Their regular fries are awesome too. Their wings were perfectly cooked and juicy I recommend Cajun and Spicy garlic.
Their cod sandwich was nice but I wish it had a little more seasoning.
Overall a great experience.

Just a tip they are located in a charming little town with live music on every corner even outside the lumber yard."}
{"text":"There's a lot to look over on the menu here.   There are daily lunch and dinner specials.   They are $5.99 & $6.99. Except for prime Rib on Saturday 10oz got $12.95. There's also a special board, well it's actually a clip board.   I went with mom, who was all in a their salads.  

her choice was a strawberry mandarin salad. It has fruit mixed in (like it should) but nothing that jumps out at you.   The dressing was accented by demi glaze on outside of bowl.   I opted for the French dip sandwich and tried the \"deluxe\" chili.   when you add sour cream and cheese to chili it became deluxe.   when you add so much sour cream and cheese you lose the chili flavor it's not a good thing.   I wouldn't do it again.  but the French dip was very good.   The meat was cut in small chunks and the au jus had rosemary added to it.   It was a nice mix.   beware there is a lot of salt in au jus, so dip carefully. 

All said decent place.  I did get recommendations from server.   Server was good.   Middle of week was a small crowd."}
{"text":"Nice place in Peninsula across from The Winking Lizard. They have daily specials, I got the Gyro lunch (Wednesday). We ate on the patio area and it was very nice. I think they need to get a new sign, as it is a bit dated, but overall a nice (small) change of scenery from The Winking Lizard (but I still like the Lizard a bit better)."}
{"text":"\"Hey, while we're in town, the whole family is getting together for a late breakfast... at...  FISHER'S.\"

My hands were tied.  I couldn't NOT go. Two words:  Uh oh.

As I've already chronicled my dismay at the breakfast at Fisher's, I instead tried a bbq pork sandwich, fries.  Bad choice, among the many awful choices.  I just can't get over the overall filthiness of this place, and that people STILL eat there.  Jeez.

(Our server was good, pleasant, all that.  Forty-two bucks for three pretty sub-standard meals.  If this place were in any other location it would have been shuttered decades ago.  It is a greasy-spoon truck stop, without the trucks. Or charm.  Or attention to taste, cleanliness, price or any other attribute of a good business.  You've been warned.)"}
{"text":"This was once a great place to hang out and eat some really great food. My last few visits have been really disappointing. The last visit was the straw that broke the camels back. To top that off I just read their Summit County Health Departments reports. If you like dining with rodents and insects this is the place for you! I did tell a manager about my problem."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger and wing spots in Peninsula! I highly highly recommend the spicy garlic wings! They're so so yummy and I love the chunks of garlic in the sauce. 

The burgers are always delicious and come out hot and how you want it. The fries are out of this world and I wish I knew who their vendor is! I've only had fries like this at one other place but it was in South Carolina. Seriously, come for the wings and the fries! 

Drinks are strong and I love the craft beer selection this establishment has.

Service is hit or miss. Always."}
{"text":"Quite good.  Great atmosphere.  Perfect for an after hike meal & beer.  Service was just fine.  We came in with a big group (of 9) and were given excellent service.  Food was better than you would expect, and had some cool things on the menu.  Try the eggplant fries.  Why are people so afraid of eggplant?  Prices are pretty inexpensive.  The 9 of us had a bill of $88.  Not including tip.  Well worth it.  Complaints were minor.  Tables were wobbly (pet peeve) and they crammed us in to two tables even though they weren't very busy."}
{"text":"Went here after hiking and I thought it was great! We sat on the patio which has beautiful flowers. They have a bar and we had a cocktail after hiking. I orders the eggplant fries, so good. Then my friend for the fish tacos and loved them. I got the crab salad wrap and it was yummy. There are not many places but I would think this is worth the stop."}
{"text":"Fishers have been there many times eggplant fries excellent, BLT was good not great, 
Service was a little slow this visit as others who came in after were served before us."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the restaurant is not very inviting. Too Bright and wooden benches. Waitress kept forgetting to bring stuff and wrong drinks. The food was pretty good. Wouldn't go back.  Go across the street."}
{"text":"Shortstaffed...If I had a nickel...
Food came out over 45 munutes later and made me late to get back for scheduled webinar....
I HATE being late for things and this got under my skin a bit...
PLUS...
Food cold...
Dang it.... I didn't ding the waitress because we should have stipulated a \"please expedite\"...Next time we go it better be better....
But the place is very nice!!
Plan on giving them one more chance....
Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"Terrible. The coffee is the weakest most flavorless dishwater you could imagine. The breakfast eggs I had we're cold, salty, and dry. And the wrap I had on my last and final visit was soggy with some sort of canned sauce. I wanted to like Fishers. I live nearby and honestly wanted to have a decent restaurant within walking distance of my house, but it isn't Fishers. Sadly, I can only hope that they will one day go out of business or sell to someone who actually cares about making decent food. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Nice little spot for Breakfast.  I have only ever been there for breakfast. They have a nice selection of items on the menu.  Eggs, omelets, pancakes, etc.  I had the sausage gravy and biscuits.  Nice sized bowl of gravy and two decent sized biscuits, and diced potatoes.  I've always enjoyed their food.  Also tried my son's pancakes which were awesome.  Their pancakes have a crispness and a crunch that I love.  We were there on a Saturday morning. It was quite busy, and they seemed under staffed.  Food took a while to come out.   Overall, great food but it may take a while."}
{"text":"It was my first time going here and I will definitely  be back! Our server Amira was very friendly and knowledgeable about both the menu and beers they had to offer. The eggplant fries were out of this world and the sauce with them was amazing. I highly recommend them! I also had the peel and eat shrimp which was seasoned very well and definitely got plenty of shrimp! I will be going back and will be asking for Amira next time I go!"}
{"text":"After riding the Towpath this morning, my girlfriends and I enjoyed a filling lunch at Fisher's.  It was my first time here, but my friends raved about their food from past visits.  Aleksa was our server.  She had a sweet personality and did her job well.

I was just sad that it took so long for the food to arrive to our table, and equally as sad that the eggplant fries tasted mostly like fried batter.  The regular fries my friends ordered were nice, as were the wraps we each got for our meals, but overall the food was just ok.

Maybe I'll bring hubby back for one of their summer patio concerts and beer menu.. I heard the wings are good."}
{"text":"We came here before a concernt at Blossom and it was PACKED! You had a mix of concert goers, bikers, and locals. The food is decent as you can choose from a wide variety- from fresh fish (specials), to mommas cooking, and ofcourse your typical bar food (wings and burgers). My only complaint was that we waited forever to get our food and the waitress was horrible! We ordered chips and guac as an appetizer and she brought with our meal! Other than that definitely a place to stop if you are in the area. Highly recommend ordering the Pie!"}
{"text":"This has become my
New local hangout, nothing like walking into the pub and having your drink already on the way from the the very personable and friendly staff at fishers.  The food quality is above the lizard, if you like grilled chucked but do not like eating charcoal lines on it then you need to be eating at Fishers.  Better mixed drinks and better food, I just hope this review doesn't make it crowded."}
{"text":"Went to this café on memorial day. Although the restaurant was far from full, we waited more than 45 minutes for our food.  Service is definitely slow and the attentiveness of the waitress could be improved. The Pub burger was juicy with good flavor and the fish sandwich was also quite good. One person in our party ordered wings and they were very overcooked and the sauces did not arrive with them when they were delivered. Several individuals ordered french fries and they were only medium warm when they were delivered also."}
{"text":"Was there this sunday and ate dinner. My food tasted plain nothing great you can tell its all frozen and processed. Great service i had a young lady named crystal she waited on me whenever i needed her they need more servers like her. I would recommend her. This place would be amazing if they had good cooked food from the heart and not coming in frozen. Need real cook."}
{"text":"A nice place to catch a meal.  The service is a little slow.  But a sunny day in Peninsula, why are you in a hurry?  Their spicy chicken wings are pretty good.  Not too spicy, just good hot flavor.  They have several beers on tap, and an ok selection of bottles.  I have not had breakfast there.  I did have the apple pie with ice cream, and it was above average.   Bottom line it is not as good as the Winking Lizard across the street, but it will do when the Lizard is busy."}
{"text":"Went for a dinner based on Yelp reviews. Mediocre service but really bad steak, ribs and drinks. 
Do not go here unless you love bad bar food"}
{"text":"Went for Clambake last night...   Everyone complained that the Clams were sandy.. wife didn't even finish hers..   Potato overcooked and corn completely mushy..   Steak cam out rare barely cooked..  Sent it back nicely.. came back overcooked..  Waitress embarrassed and basically ignored me the rest of the night like it was my fault..   Beer was good but that is hard to mess up...  I will never go back and I suggest you spend your money somewhere else.."}
{"text":"Fish fry with wife tonight. Has to be the best beer  battered cod anywhere. Fries were perfectly crisp also. Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast and was really happy with my choice. Eggs, potatoes, bacon, biscuits and gravy.... yummmm. It's hard to find good biscuits and gravy and these certainly qualify. Coffee was good and service was really good. I also enjoyed the atmosphere. I would come back for breakfast and will certainly be back to try their lunch and dinner menu."}
{"text":"We stopped at Fisher's as we had not dined there for some time and we were happy to see some improvements- new tables, chairs and umbrellas outside plus a new roof above the outside bar with ceiling fans- Very Nice! The specials that were available were enticing- hard to decide which to get! Food was great, hot, seasoned well and served in normal time frame. We had the ribs- which were tender and very good (1/2 rack for $8.99 special) We also had the Mahi Mahi with mango salsa- again tender and moist, perfectly cooked! Our server was very personable and we had a really nice time. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Our party of 4 arrived at 5pm on Memorial Day for an early dinner. This place was already buzzing with patrons in the outdoor patio and a few families inside.

We were seated in a booth near the entrance in one section of the dining room with a lunch bar.  Unfortunately, this area was not well cooled and I was sweating within a few minutes of entering. After checking out the \"pub\" section of the restaurant I asked to be moved to that area as it was cooler and I could feel the air conditioning.

I did notice that there were a lot of employees in uniforms working while we were there but unfortunately the service was a tad bit slower than I would have liked.

I ordered their Prime Rib Special ($16.99) which came with a potato and a salad which I substituted for eggplant fries (add $1.59) and corn on the cob. Both sides were very good. The beef itself was tender but not served with any jus and was a little dry. 

They had an Asian Salmon fish meal on the menu but was told they had sold out because of the holiday weekend. My dining partners ordered a tuna sub, fried cod sandwich and crispy chicken salad. None of them had any complaints about their food.

Our server was friendly and kept checking in on us to top off the coffee and water glasses.  The restaurant could have been cleaner but it was horribly dirty.

Overall, our dining experience was pleasant but did not \"wow\" me."}
{"text":"Salad fresh, sangria fresh made and cold and the service youthful and friendly.  I got the Lock 29 salad w local spinach and strawberries delicious."}
{"text":"Came in after work looking for nice patio to have a drink or two, apps and casual dinner. They were out of beers we wanted on draft and only specials on menu weren't starting until the following week. Ordered the chips and spicy queso app but it came out with just shredded cheese. Pico de gallo was good but chips were super super greasy like they had been pre-fried, and then fried again. Tried the fish taco app as well which was ok although there was nothing more to them than mango salsa and some fish. Would have been much better in a soft taco than a hard half stale shell. Bacon blue burger was again just ok however was up charged $2 for a side salad the size of 8 bites without being told by the server. Service was just ok. Breakfast menu looked promising, but overall would not return."}
{"text":"First time back in a while.   BBQ pork sandwich was good but would have been much better with some pickle slices or some onions.   Eggplant fries were terrific and the horseradish dipping sauce made them."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in such a perfect town! Perfect place to go after a hike or walk! I loved the beer battered fish and the service is great!"}
{"text":"This place has great service and food. We stopped here after riding on the train with our family.  The power was out, but they still took care of us!!  Great staff."}
{"text":"I had the ribs, and the barbecue sauce was great! It was tasty, and didn't taste like something out of a bottle. The ribs were cooked in a way I really enjoyed. The meat came off the bone easily, but didn't have a mushy texture that sometimes happens when the meat literally falls off the bone. The fries were the crispy type, and that is not my personal favorite. The server was attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"Located in downtown Peninsula, this is a friendly neighborhood hangout and get together spot. Lots of hikers and bikers come here from nearby Towpath and CVNP to cap off a day of activity with a good meal and a few brews.  They have a great patio, plenty of wait staff ( how often do you hear that?). And good, consistent food that will make you happy.  Try the eggplant fries.   So good and a healthy option as well. My husband loved them and he doesn't touch anything green (technically, these would be purple). I got a tasty burger done just right. Juicy and fresh toppings. Our group enjoyed boneless wings and steak as well. All equally tasty. My daughter got one of their, made on the premises, real ice cream milk shakes and raves over it. 
We were camping, so we returned the next day for breakfast. The quiche was delicious and the serving size would satisfy any hungry camper. Berry French Toast and Whole Wheat pancakes. All generous, all delicious and I loved the little syrup bottle, once I figured out how to get it going!  
The staff is knowledgeable, locally owned (the owner often is there), stop in sometime and give it a try.  Warm welcoming atmosphere. They will even put the sound on for whatever game you might be watching."}
{"text":"Very good. Had the friendliest, most entertaining server, Stacy. Food was all good. There were 4 of us and we each enjoyed our meals. The chili was very good. Very nice atmosphere, comfortable."}
{"text":"Went on Wednesday for the $14.98 lobster.  Very poor, stringy, very little lobster meat. Two of our friends ordered burgs and were sick all night.  Quite disappointed!"}
{"text":"We have eaten many times at Fisher's, and enjoyed breakfasts to dinner, but wanted to share our love of this local gem with others this time around. We came in this past Friday on a busy night and got seated outside on the patio pretty quickly. Our server, Tiffany B, was awesome! She is attentive, cheerful, and ready to answer any questions we had about the food and the beers. Love the variety of craft beers available, especially the Oktoberfest varieties! Our hands-down favorite food is the eggplant fries but we tried some items new to us this time. My husband had the lobster and clams: we both tried the homemade clam chowder that came with it. Excellent soup! Not salty like so many soups made in restaurants these days. I had the fish fry - the fish came out hot and crispy, with fries and cole slaw. If you are in Peninsula enjoying the train or the Towpath, make Fisher's your stop for a good meal!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, eggplant fries and ribs. Friendly service in a retro setting in the middle of a national park. Yeungling beer on tap!  Fun place."}
{"text":"A good local place - should definitely be explored by more people!

After being in Peninsula many times, I've finally tried Fisher's. It's really your only option other than the Winking Lizard....and I've had enough of that place.  

Anyway there are three things you should know. 1) There are a lot of food options, so everyone should be able to find something, 2) their french fries are AWESOME, 3) biggest downside of this place is that it smells like an grease - so don't wear anything nice because you will smell like grease when you walk out."}
{"text":"My husband and I were completely shocked!  This was our first visit to Fishers and most certainly will not be our last!  We ordered the Applewood bacon burger and Cod dinner. The burger was delicious and cooked perfectly. It was apparent that the meat was NOT frozen. The fish was crunchy on the outside and flakey on the inside. French fries were crunchy, just the way we like them. I cannot wait to come back and try other menu items."}
{"text":"Definitely under rated on this site. Good atmosphere, service and food at a terrific price."}
{"text":"Bang for your buck: 3/10
Quality: 2/10
Service: 4.5/10
Ambiance/Location: 7.5/10
Overall: 4/10

Service was awful. Sat at the bar outside. Limited beer selection. Adorable place with seeming promise, but the food was obviously all frozen from GFS and totally overpriced for what it was."}
{"text":"We have only eaten there at breakfast and love it!  Their biscuits are awesome!  Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because it can take quite a while to get your food, and no one ever says goodbye or thank you when we leave."}
{"text":"Loved Fishers!  Great bar food.  Nice people.  Roomy booths.  Who could ask for more?!"}
{"text":"My server was amazing, very nice, and kept refreshing my sweet tea. I went on a weekend, so they had the grill going. A full slab of ribs was amazing, falling off the bone. The fries are usually a side I don't notice, but here they were really good. Good price, good service, good food."}
{"text":"Service wasn't great. We sat down and had to request menus after a few minutes of waiting because the waitress didn't come by. They weren't attentive and once again we had to request the bill at the end of the meal. This was during a time when the place wasn't too busy, either. 

The chili was pretty standard, not bad, and the eggplant fries were oily but rather tasty. The apple dumpling was pretty awful -- undercooked and doughy.

Overall pretty mediocre. Wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Great food in a quaint, homey environment. Our waitress Alana could not have been nicer. Recommend the Raider Burger (with a cup of milk, quite hot!) And some onion rings. Good stop for after a hike."}
{"text":"My family and I were riding the Cuyahoga Valley trail and stopped in to have a quick lunch before catching the train. We had an hour and a half to get our food and eat. We told the waitress about our time worry and she assured us that we would have plenty of time to eat. We ordered grilled cheese sandwiches for our two kids (aged 2 & 10 months) and burgers for my husband and I. An hour and 15 mins later our food came out cold. We had to reluctantly pay and get our food to go. Very disappointed. This could be a great stop along the trail. We will not be back and urge riders to beware if you are on a time constraint."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly servers!  Don't miss the hot bacon dressing!!  In the fall the lobster dinner is a must!   Nothing beets a cold drink on the patio after a walk on the tow path in the summer and in the winter it's the best place to stop for a meal with friends after skiing!"}
{"text":"Really great burgers and fries! Juicy, big burgers on a great bun. The fries seem to be battered, very crisp. Great service and food tonight, we really enjoy this place. The triple chocolate coffee (alcohol) is amazing! We also had the pretzel bites appetizer and it was amazing. This is a fun local place for great pub food."}
{"text":"Restaurant we were headed for had a wait so we went across street yum!
We both got 1/2 rack of ribs cooked prefect excellent sauce. The eggplant fries were wonderful. 50's decor and service was excellent . Full bar and cold beers. Serves breakfast to late night. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So I admit.  
I'm crazy. 
 I keep repeating the same thing, (dining here), expecting a different result, (a good dining experience/meal).
But they do have a bitchin' patio, and they are nestled in the middle of the CVNR!  
Stopped here today for lunch.
Having spent several years in Southern  California, I have a taste for fish tacos, and so does the lady.
Noting that they were grilled made the decision a no-brainer for us both.
Our server was a youngun' inexperience pervaded the day.
I had to explain to her the difference between brewed iced tea and fountain iced tea, and I still got what I think was an incorrect answer, (that they served fountain tea.)
But who am i to challenge the waitstaff?
Diet Cokes around, and water for me in anticipation of sketchy service.
The latter was a good call!
The tacos took forever to arrive, and our glasses were never filled during the wait.
When the tacos were quickly dumped off, she stared at our empty glasses and asked if there was anything else we wanted, and of course we asked for refills, and as she shot away with our glasses, I tried to shout after her that two sets of service would be great, but no ears heard our plea.  And after waiting forever again for the refills and a shot at a second request for napkins and silverware, the lady skipped up to the bar area and secured our necessaries.  Oh great!  Now I have to tip her as well!!!
The tacos.
Interesting.
It's possible that there was fish in them.
If so it was fish scraps.
Literally.
The stuff that sticks to the bone when the fish is filleted either by mechanical separators at a factory somewhere, or in the kitchen.
You know, the stuff that used to go in cat food!
Never during the dining experience was either of us certain we had just bit into a piece of fish flesh.
There was a flour tortilla, some spinach and a very modest bit of filling in each of the three tacos we were each served.
There was seasoning, and veggies most notably onions.  And what might have been little pencil eraser sized battered and dipped bits of  fish or ????
Certainly not even close to  the size of the fish bites McDonalds sold this Lenten season.
And if they were fish, there was far less fish in each than there is beef in a Taco Bell taco.
And people are getting shot by disgruntled patrons there seeking meat in the shell!
Just pick up a paper!
I get being cheap with fish...when it's mahi mahi or roughy or ono or redfish or swordfish, fresh tuna, even salmon but cod??  
The stuff I buy in filet form from Sam's Club for 4 bucks a pound? 
AKA the price of ground chuck?
Mr Fisher, you're scrimping where you oughtn't!
For ten bucks, there ought to be about as much fish as the typical restaurant would put in their fried fish dinners, but not here!
I'm starting to think this place is just a beverage place for us on a hot summer's day.
Buckets of crap light beer were $14 for 4.  Almost exactly the cost per beer as the cost per taco!
Next time that's what I'm zeroing in on!!
I'm over the whole food thing here!"}
{"text":"We thought we should give this family fav another try almost a year later.... So we went in yesterday for lunch. Had a great time! Burger was great and the chili was good. Server in the cafe was very attentive.  Maybe I caught them on a bad night a year ago :/."}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot. The spinach salad with home made raspberry vinaigrette is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here while at the national park. Service was great, and might be the best wings that I've ever had! Coming back on Friday for the all you can eat fish fry. Stop in, you will love it."}
{"text":"We stopped in here off the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad tour and immediately were greeted by a very rude hostess who tried to squeeze 6 people into a corner booth. She had zero customer service skills and  I was put off immediately.

Our server came by and was a breath of fresh air. We realized soon that we did NOT have enough time for our meals and apologized profusely. We had already ordered so we asked for to go boxes. Our server had the kitchen box up our food, provided napkins, utensils, bags and everything we needed to enjoy our brunch on the train. 

My breakfast was simple but perfectly executed. It was delicious and very well priced. 

I'd probably stop back if I were in the area."}
{"text":"We eat here about once a month, so I believe the frequency gives me credibility in saying that most of the   meals here have been tasty, hot and fresh. And most of the time, service is better than average. The quantities are very good. We have tried several things on the menu, however, our favorite are the ribs and the eggplant French Fries with Wasabi sauce. It may sound weird, but oh my are they good!  I also love the black bean burger!"}
{"text":"Good food with a long wait and disorganized seating. We came here for lunch (great wings and friendly waitresses, however we were forced to wait outside for 15 minutes. I wouldn't have minded waited inside and been offered beverages and that way have been in the ac. In this temperature it was hellish sitting outside for a long period of time. However, once inside, we were provided excellent customer service. If the restaurant allowed waiting inside, it would get 5 stars. However, knowing my experience, it gets a three."}
{"text":"Best fries ever!  Service is sometimes slow, but the excellent food and prices makes up for that fault.  My friends and I love to go to Fisher's for a fun night out."}
{"text":"They a have great vendor for their fries. That's all I got... I know, I always have so much to say. The wait staff and management were accommodating, but I will never return. PS stay away from the cod."}
