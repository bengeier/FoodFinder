{"text":"Friendly service, spacious and good pitcher prices. I somehow spent less money on beer than food. Southwestern eggrolls were on the level and the pizza buffet was very filling. The salad bar portion isn't extensive, but it has everything that you need. Lots of different pizza options throughout your lunch, and there are usually 5+ available at any time. Buffet for $10 isn't bad at all. It's more pricey than CiCis, but also tastes better."}
{"text":"Service is good
Place is clean
Nice ambience 
Server was very nice and always tried to accommodate any issues
Value is good for the buffet
My biggest issue is Food. Very similar to cafeteria pizza. Marconi had a frozen taste. Chicken and sausage used also had a strong frozen type taste.
Probably not go again unless I am really craving pizza and nothing else is open"}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet. Numerous choices of pizza constantly being refreshed. Salad and drinks included.  Have some quirks to work out like all new places but have been twice and was better the second time."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with some friends a couple of nights ago for karaoke.  My first impression of the place was good.  The design concept looks great and my hopes for a good time and good food were alive and well?...that is until I? came across one of the servers.  I don'?t remember her name, but she came off as snarky to me when she greeted me as I waited for my friends to arrive.  I asked her if she worked there, failing to notice the apron and she said:? \"Nope?, I ?wear this outfit for fun.\"  I don't have a problem with the statement itself, but the way in which she said it.  So I said to myself? \"I hope your service is better than your attitude because you may have just spent your tip on that comment.  So my friends arrived and we proceeded to order our food.  One person ordered a salad and we all laughed at the fact that there were butts of lettuce on her plate and it frankly looked like something you'd get out of a poorly run cafeteria?.  Not a good omen for the chili nachos I ordered.  I am not super picky and I understand that running a restaurant?  is hard work, but when you pay $8.99 for nachos as an appetizer?  you should expect to get a dish that is well prepared and seasoned like its worth some money.  This was not the case.  The chips were lukewarm and the cheese was watery at best...like they took a jar of Tostitos? dip and watered it down to save money.  The chili tasted like it came straight from a can to my plate without any effort to heat it.  Then they put lettuce on it along with dipping containers of sour cream and salsa (most likely out of a can as well.  One of the guys at my table is a chef and he said that he would be embarrassed? to serve that.  I would have let all this slide if the price wasn't? so steep.  I think that dish should have gone for $4.99 if I am being generous.  To quote Mr.? Wonderful (see Shark Tank) \"they need to take this dish behind the barn and shoot it.\"  After tasting literally a couple of chips, I asked to exchange the dish for something else and the waitress said \"you ate most of it so it's? going on your bill.  \"That may be, but your tip sure won't be.\" I thought.  I give this place 2 stars because the karaoke guy did a good job and the place has some great beer selections.  The layout also looks great as I mentioned before.  The chicken wings were great and I? wish I  had ordered those instead.  My suggestion would be to 86 the nachos and learn to make a salad.  Also,? send your wait staff to some customer service classes or something.  I might try the buffet, but who knows.  I read that Champaign has the most restaurants per capita in the country and so I don't see this place lasting very long if they don't get their act together soon.  Glad my money isn't on the line with this place."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and the staff did a great job. The food is ok but not greater. The pizza seemed to be very generic."}
{"text":"Tried the blt pizza and it was amazing had to go back for another. Natalie was very attentive at the bar and very nice!"}
{"text":"Went for the Tuesday night buffet. It was picked over and didn't see vegetarian options for the pizza. Once I spoke to the waiter about it they were very happy to accommodate and make a cheese pizza and garden veggie pizza. They kept the pizzas coming out and I realized why it looked picked over, as soon as they brought the pizzas out people were grabbing them up. No problem there just means everything was fresh. The salad bar was nice as well. The food was normal and priced decent. The service and accommodations they made were above and beyond. Some of the best service I have ever received ! I will recommend to all me friends."}
{"text":"Pizza was very average. There's much better in this town, but also some that's worse.  Atmosphere was average. Huge space obviously makes it difficult to heat. Too cool inside, for February.  The service saved our experience from being completely average.  It was very good."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times since they've opened since I live close by. The service here is awesome! The male bartender is very helpful and very friendly. I've had the pizza buffet, spinach dip, and wings and they were all delicious. Food came out fast and servers checked on us regularly. I've been recommending this place to my friends and co workers and no one has been disappointed yet. Great hang out spot!"}
{"text":"Was here for a big event and loved the pizza. My favorite was whatever had the bacon, sausage, pepperoni, and ham. The karaoke options were essentially unlimited, which was very cool. But the stage was small and abruptly turns into an edge several feet above the hall on the first floor, which looks like a big injury hazard and an accident waiting to happen if you're serving alcohol. Overall I had an enjoyable time, will try and make it out for trivia at some point."}
{"text":"Went to Rafters for the first time today. We thought it would be a great spot to grab an easy lunch that was off the beaten path.  Something new and exciting. The inside is beautiful. A huge place great for groups or to watch a game. We looked at the menu- beer selection poor. Food. Oh my lanta. Handful of your basic frozen and fried appetizers, 4 sandwiches, 4 salads and 4 pizza options side from make your own. That's it. So we order hummus, two beers and two sandwiches. First, our food comes down and gets set on the bar and our waitress looks flustered, runs up to the kitchen to come down with our hummus. Store bought hummus and ugly veggies and basic chips they kept in a warmer. We paid $7 for Sabra hummus that took 20 minutes to get to us while our food died on the bar 4 feet from the entrance where cold air poured in. She brings the food over after about 5-6mins. It wasn't good. It was mediocre and now cold. I'll never go back. Don't waste your time or money. Frozen pizzas, your favorite beer and chips and dip will get you the same experience. Wish I could have my money back."}
{"text":"Great pizza and beer!   Stopped in between baseball games since it was so close to Parkland and Dodds for lunch.  Wasn't super busy because of it being a Sunday I think.  We went with the special that day of a large 2 topping pizza for only $10.  Appetizers and food all came out very quick and everything was great.  We would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Rafters looks GREAT! If you remember the old Bradley's II you will not believe the transformation. Super cool space, I was immediately excited to settle in and experience this place. 

Ashlee, the server, was spectacular. Warm, friendly, and knowledgeable! She told me all about what beers were on tap and even the ABV %. Above and beyond service. 

Cheese curd appetizer was fine; it was from frozen, but passable, I ate it, no problem. The pizza is not unlike Domino's; puffy crust, a little doughy, and mediocre ingredients. Overall, the food was unremarkable, but very fair prices for pizza. And honestly,  eating average pizza is still a good day. 

I am thrilled to have Rafter's on this side of town and would certainly go back. What it lacks in pizza, is made up with the beautiful space and solid beer list."}
{"text":"First time at Rafters. Service is good, pizza was very good, crust has a good flavor. Could use a little more red sauce for my tastes."}
{"text":"Went for the first time tonight and I'm so disappointed in the pizza.  Tasteless is the best way I can describe it. It needs more sauce & some spices. Atmosphere is fantastic & the staff which is why I gave my review 3 stars, food is zero stars. They'd better change the recipe quick."}
{"text":"So, I ordered about $48 worth of food to be delivered around 9pm. My ordered was cancelled by the restaurant an hour later. I had 11 people at my home waiting for food. Your staff decided not to make my order. And what time do you stop taking orders for delivery?!?????? Your restaurant is still open and my guests did not get food. I should have just picked rosatis. I wanted to try this place. I'm so ashamed my guests had no food."}
{"text":"Ee just enjoyed Rafters.  Good pizza and our server, Aaron, was great.  We had a group of eleven and we had a great experience."}
{"text":"Incredible new place!!  Clean atmosphere,  great food, great beer selection!  Hott bearded bartender!!"}
{"text":"Went here the second Wednesday of the year, as part of \"we haven't eaten here on Wednesday\". I know a couple of people working here, so was excited to see what their new ventures out be. 
We ordered some apps, and both got individual pizzas. 
Kridz got a beer, I had whiskey. 
One thing I noticed right away, was that while the tap handle arrangement looks interesting, it's going to cause a lot of waste of beer. The taps are above the bar, a good 2 feet above the splash/drain. So, when pouring, the server doesn't have any time to let the beer clear out. (when pouring a beer on draft, the first second or so has a lot of carbon dioxide, if you can let this part splash into the drain, the beer will then pour very nicely. If you don't let that part run out, then you will routinely fill a glass with a lot of foam, once the rest of the beer hits that foamy section, it will foam up too, and you wind up trying to splash out the foam, then fill with beer, then splash, then fill..., well, with the system that high above the drain, you can't do it very well, and it causes a lot of beer waste). 
The appetizers were ok, nothing spectacular, seemed like just things that were all deep fried. 
The pizza was ok too. To me, it reminded me of Totino's Party Pizza. The crust had the same feel as that, and the sauce even reminded me of it. As a kid, me and my siblings would routinely come across some frozen pizzas that had sauce that tasted a bit too sweet, instead of tomato, it presented with a hint of watermelon. We called it watermelon pizza. This sauce reminded me of that. 
They have a lunch buffet, which will probably be very popular with the students over at Parkland, as there isn't very much for food options in that expanding campus area."}
{"text":"I went today with some coworkers for lunch buffet. When I saw the first Yelp review of this place for 1 star, I thought, \"Give these guys a break! They just opened!\" Now that I have been to Rafters, I think 1 star is closer to accurate than 5. I go with 2 stars because the service was kind and attentive and the pizzas came out quickly. The salad bar is a neat idea but freshness and variety were extremely lacking--shredded iceberg lettuce, slimy carrot sticks, several types of cheese, bacon, croutons, diced tomatoes, diced celery. You'd find a comparable serving of fiber on a Big Mac. As for pizza, the dough and red sauce were to me, excessively sweet, trending towards discount supermarket frozen pizza. Thin crust lacked any noticeable crisp, bordering on spongy. Thick crust was occasionally undercooked, reasonably cheesy but generally not delicious. Some interesting topping combos, including liberal use of bacon, but somehow even the bacon lacked flavor. Old Chicago is better in almost every respect, and that's saying a lot. Maybe less greasy than Old Chi but that's the best I can say. Nice space and lots of TVs."}
