{"text":"Amazing. Always craving Poke and this place does not disappoint. The small size is super filling because they have soo many vegetables and toppings with no restrictions on how much you can fill in your bowl. Prices are very reasonable! I love how they have kimchi too. Everyone who works there is super friendly as well. My new lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and a very passionate staff that guide you through the bowl building process if the cuisine is newer, as it was for me. The ingredients are fresh and the staff does a wonderful job recommending combinations to suit your palette. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing tuna and I love all the toppings. The flexibility is a huge plus-- you can have some greens and rice/noodles and don't have to pick just one. I recommend the dried seaweed"}
{"text":"We absolutely love his place! My family and I come at least once a week but this week it's 3 times. The portions are great and the fish is high quality. They also have an option for our little ones, teriyaki meatballs over rice. The price is just right too! But the owner probably has the best customer service we have ever encountered! He is incredibly nice and always looking to improve. Best Poke Spot ever!!!"}
{"text":"Omg this was awesome! Very reasonably priced. The server was very helpful and friendly! The food looked amazing and tasted delicious! I will definitely be recommending it to others. I can't wait to come back again! I am so glad I just happened to drive by and find this place around lunch time."}
{"text":"This is the BEST poke spot I have been to in AZ! They have so many options for toppings and the fish was so fresh even on a Monday!! The customer service was extraordinary, walked in and the guy working let us try their house marinated tuna and all the sauces. He mixed some stuff to help me find something I like! I loved their concept of \"mix ins\" that they mixed with your protein and sauce! Such a great place as a whole, great food, great people. Go eat here Help keep it alive so we can all have the perfect lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Compared with Koi Poke, I like this place better because rice was hot and soba noodle was tasty. I liked radish sprouts and kimchee toppings. I had Tofu & Octopus. Tofu was creamy and very good. Tako was a bit too big to chew on. Super friendly staff. Will come back again."}
{"text":"First time for Poke. So flavorful and fresh!. Spring Mix base, 2 scoops Protein (spicy ahi and Salmon)  Edamame, kimchi,  pickled onions mango, and jalapeno made perfect spicy sweet bitter mix."}
{"text":"Poke bowls are incredible with lots of tasty options!  Something rare these day is great customer, but this location is delivering amazing service and follow-up every time!"}
{"text":"First time in tonight and it was fantastic! If you are looking for a super healthy meal, this is the place!!  I ordered the big kahuna on mixed greens. With the order you get three scoops of seafood, I chose two tuna and shrimp. He mixed it with the spicy sauce. It was so delicious. You definitely get your money's worth of food. The service was great, he explained how to order and the available selections. The food was prepared as I made selections. Great fast service. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was just passing through town and I'm really glad that I stopped by. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Generous portions. Delicious food."}
{"text":"If you're craving poke, this is the place. Really fresh fish and an awesome staff! Not bad on pricing either so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"Easily the lowest quality fish that I've ever had in a poke bowl. It smelled and tasted bad. The toppings weren't particularly good either, but all that matters is the fish. 

They seem to be aiming for a bargain. Makes no sense given their North Scottsdale location. I'd rather spend 50% more for quality/edible fish. 

Even if you love all poke, as I do, don't waste your time here. It's the bottom of the barrel."}
{"text":"Super good, super clean food. I love the mix of tuna and salmon over brown rice and greens with s sesame sauce and spicing."}
{"text":"Stopped here looking for a good poke bowl and received an excellent poke bowl! The food is awesome and the service is even better. You can tell they care. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a few days on business, and ended up going to this restaurant twice, I liked it so much. The restaurant is very neat and clean, including the bathrooms, which is very important for me. The food was a tremendous value - I got quite a large portion for a very modest cost. The fish was very fresh, and had lots of flavor. In fact, the fish was better than most poke places I've been to in the Phoenix area. I was greeted immediately upon entering, and felt right at home. I left feeling full, but not bloated - very healthy fare. I will go back every time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This was amazing!! I love poke and finding a place in N scottsdale was amazing. Everything was super fresh and crisp. The employees helped me order and recommended good flavor combos which i appreciated. I got a lot of food for only $10 which doesn't make my wallet mad at me. I would recommend trying this place out for anyone interested you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is by far my most frequently visited restaurant in Scottsdale.  The owners are super friendly and genuinely care about making your experience positive.  
The food is delicious!  Having a shellfish allergy myself I have to be careful with poke but I have never had an issue with any cross contamination here.  The fish is always fresh, the toppings tasty and sauces yummy! 
They do have some cooked options if you are concerned about eating raw.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh and super delicious. Salmon, tuna, greens,  seaweed salad...so good"}
{"text":"All of the fish was fresh and melted in your mouth, unlike poke I've had from some other establishments I expected more from.  The staff (maybe owners) were super friendly  and helpful.  My soba noodles with Hawaiin ahi and all the other items were delicious. Togarashi and their wasabi sauce were excellent additions.

Will make this a stop on each visit in the future.
There are a few tables, if you want to eat in.  Most seemed to grab and go.  Not really a restaurant if you are wondering about atmosphere."}
{"text":"The is my favorite Poke spot in Scottsdale. 
The food is fresh and delicious. I always go to a restaurant a second time prior to leaving a Yelp review to make sure there is consistency. The array or ingredients to laid your bowl are scrumptious. Also, the owner Tyler and staff are beyond friendly and accommodating. Very cute atmosphere and they deliver! Also open late! Bonus!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a late lunch. Will be back again when I'm in the mood for something light and fresh. With the hot temps coming up soon this will be a good place to eat something not too heavy.

PROS
1. Very nice and helpful owner. Great customer service.
2. Fresh fish, salad, and toppings.
3. Good flavor and sauces. 

CONS
1. Slightly small fish/poke portion size. Rest of the salad was a good amount. 
2. Increase the heat/spice level a bit on some of the spicy sauces."}
{"text":"I've been on a Poke trip lately and gave Poke Spot a shot.  In typical poke fashion you choose your fish scoops, base, mix ins, sauce, & toppings.  I selected a salmon & tuna bowl with brown rice, cucumber, jalapeño, green onion, house and spicy sauce, avocado, sesame seeds, & wonton strips.  

The fish was good quality, the tuna was melt in your mouth good.  The house spicy and sliced (not diced) jalapeño added a lot of heat.  The avocados didn't look fresh and took awhile for the pit and skin to be removed and sliced.  I think this place could be great with a few tweaks - adding cilantro, dicing the jalapeño, fixing the avocados."}
{"text":"Great Poke! Awesome flavor combinations you won't be disappointed!!! So good this place rocks. Thanks for the poke up north Scottsdale way!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Was skeptical being in a desert / far from any ocean, but the quality of the fish was like being along the coast.

Loved the option for soba noodles as a base, instead of white/brown rice or salad. Got 2 proteins, the Hawaiian Style Ahi Tuna and Salmon, and both tasted fresh! Wish they had put twice as much of both in, felt like they skimped a bit on the amount of fish, which is why I deducted a star.

The variety of toppings was plentiful, and everything was fresh! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food is exceptional and delicious in addition  the service is really friendly and helpful. I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Very fresh fish and great concept. Staff very personable and attentive. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My Poke Bowl is so fresh and absolutely delicious! The guy working was so informative and friendly and he took time to explain all the ingredients and even offered some delicious suggestions for my bowl. I'm totally addicted and am already thinking about when I can go back for more!

Update: I'm currently eating at a another poke restaurant and it isn't even half as good as Poke Spot!! Why must you be closed on Sundays Poke Spot....whyyyyyy?!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Tyler was great and the food is high par. Fresh and tasty, just the way it should be. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So good! It's like a rice bowl but with sushi instead of chicken or steak. I don't know how it's so cheap since it's like the price of one sushi roll and you get a whole bowl but I am not complaining, I'll going back again today!"}
{"text":"Poke poke poke! You had me at \"poke\" -- so nice to have another option in the area. They are still getting their bearings as the place is new, but the food was fantastic and the staff was wonderfully friendly. My one suggestion they need a few premade or easy options for people who need a quick meal. Also some better decor - feels sparse right now. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I live close to this place. This is awesome food and great service. I've already got five punches on my card and excited to fill it up. I hope that they do well because it's quickly becoming my favorite"}
{"text":"Great customer service, you can feel the passion in here! Food is delicious. Definitely will be eating here  more frequently.  If Tyler is around you will be well served!!"}
{"text":"Best poke in town!  Really friendly nice service, fresh, quality ingredients, and great price. You can tell they put a lot of care into their preparation. Highly recommend!  Support this local place.  I believe it's a father/son operation. Great people, great poke."}
{"text":"This place is really good and the staff is super friendly. Awesome place to go for a healthy bite to eat! My husband and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Sushi places in the area. It's not your ordinary sushi, it comes in a bowl instead of rolls. I like the fact that I can design what I want in my bowl. I had the spicy tuna and salmon and they were both delicious. The price was reasonable just like any other form of sushi places, but I feel like I get more for my money at this place. The staff was friendly, and new what went well with what dish you wanted."}
{"text":"Wife and I found this little place by accident up on Scottsdale road and decided to drop in for lunch. By now, everyone knows what poke is, so I'll just say that I loved the very fresh fish, vegetables and seasonings, and the staff was friendly. They will take the time to explain \"the process\" to you, so no worries. There are 3 sizes of bowls, all reasonably priced. Will definitely be back when that poke craving hits again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always phenomenal service, everyone who works here is so helpful and nice. It also helps that the Poké bowls are awesome. Never had a bad experience here, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"These guys are great! Great environment, great food, great choices. Picked this for lunch because we wanted a fresh bright flavor, this totally delivered! The team was very personable and had a real focus on service. Glad we chose this!"}
{"text":"Really bad quality tuna. Mine smelled and tasted off. The one bite I tasted was cat food or canned tuna quality. The sauce was very bland and they don't have a kids menu unless your kid wants raw or shrimp."}
{"text":"This place has such amazing service!!! Tyler is the one who took care of me and was just super friendly!! The food is really amazing too. You have to get the animal sauce when you come here. It is to die for! The fish and all of the sides are also just so stupendous!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable!  Who knew there was a piece of Hawaii in the middle of Scottsdale!  We enjoyed everything about this delicious find.  The service was attentive, friendly and beyond expectations- coupled with incredible poke bowls that were full of fresh, tasty ingredients ... this place is a gem! We enjoyed the spicy and Hawaiian style ahi and a tofu bowl.  Both were fresh with sauces that made the dish spicy, sweet and memorable!  We are already planning our next visit to Poke Spot!"}
{"text":"This is really good poke. They have great fish and great toppings. They even have kimchi, which is dope af. 10/10 will eat again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for Poke. The food is reasonably priced and plenty of variety to choose from. The staff is courteous and informative which helps me with making a better decision when it comes to choosing the right sauce for my palette. At the time of this review, they have punch cards to earn a free bowl. Try it out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best poke in Arizona by far. The Hawaiian tuna is amazing along with everything else. They offer soba noodles which is amazing."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great attention to detail. Tyler is great and makes everyone feel welcomed."}
{"text":"I was nearby and this spot was the first place to pop up on my Yelp app today. On my way back to the office, I decided to stop by and grab a late lunch. I was greeted by an elderly gentleman when I walked in and then someone behind the counter walked me through everything they had to offer. There were only 2 other people when I stopped in but it was probably because I came in between lunch and dinner time. 

I had poke when I was in Oahu and haven't had it since. Since we have a trip to Maui coming up, I was in the mood for poke. 

I went with the Primo (2 proteins) and decided on salmon and their Hawaiian ahi. I went with brown rice as my base, the spicy & traditional sauce mixed, and cucumbers/edamame/green onions/mango/crab salad/roasted seaweed as toppings. The fish tasted as fresh as it could be since we are in Arizona and the rest of the toppings seemed fresh with the exception of the mango. 

The person helping me behind the counter was very helpful and I gobbled up my bowl as soon as I got back to work. It's a shame it's not closer to my home."}
{"text":"Tyler and his team conduct themselves in a professionally way while offering great food. Being new to Poke bowls he was able to educate me and on the ins and out of the food and what I should expect. With the multiple opinions they have and more coming per their words I think that they have a excellent choice for dinner and lunch!!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome, local, and sustainable.
The service is amazing, with recommendations being offered to help build your bowl.
The ingredients are super fresh with the some of the highest quality sushi-grade tuna, crab, greens, etc.
I highly recommend PokeSpot, It's the best Poke place in town!
Primo with Hawaiian Tuna and Spicy Tuna and Spicy Miso Onion - Nom Nom Nom x 10^10."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite place to go! The employees are so accommodating and make everyone feel very welcome. I have made it a weekly spot because it never disappoints. The food is always fresh and delicious with outstanding flavors."}
{"text":"Wow!! A super healthy dinner option that gives you practically sushi in a bowl any way you want it. Such fresh ingredients and Toppings. Loved the tuna and octopus. Such a great variety of sauces to add and the place looks amazing. You can tell the owner takes super good attention to the food quality. Customer service was OUTSTANDING!!
Making this a weekly spot for a super delicious dinner!! 
MUST Check Out!!!"}
{"text":"There has never once been a time where it wasn't spectacular. The food is always fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"For the price you get a great big portion and generous portion of the poke. Great tasting and very fresh. They even include a good serving of crab.
Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"The staff was really nice! The fish was fresh & there were a lot of sauces to choose from. The only thing I would deduct a star for is the that they charge for seaweed salad and extra sauce."}
{"text":"This place rocks! The salmon poke bowl is out of this world. The service is beyond helpful and friendly. Very nice addition to the shopping center."}
{"text":"Excellent service every time! The staff is great and always willing to make recommendations. The fish is excellent, always fresh. The toppings and mix ins are great and there's so many options that you can get something different every time. Really, can't say a single bad thing and I've been several times."}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Yes! The Poke Spot is da BOMB! The quality of food and service is outstanding. My boyfriend and I come here often and each and every time we are always served the best Poke. Each time we come here we get something different so it's hard to tell you what to order or what I recommend but if there is ANY recommendation, you have to get the Soba noodles in your bowl, it's SO good.

Fish is fresh, ingredients are fresh too! Staff is friendly and the owner is really nice.

If you like sushi but haven't tried Poke, YOU MUST! You're going to love it here at the Poke Spot."}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot! The fish is really good quality, I'm addicted to their kimchi, and the staff is super nice. Ask for a punch card. This the perfect food for summertime:Light, healthy, and packed with nutrients."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I pulled up into the parking lot. The place was really easy to find and there's plenty of parking! When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by the workers. They asked if we ever had poke and needed suggestions.

We ended up ordering a massive poke bowl with Hawaiian tuna, white rice, spring mix, cucumbers, green onions, mango, edamame, sesame seeds, crispy wontons, crab, and seaweed salad. All very delicious!  Everything tasted fresh, which is always a plus.

Don't leave with grabbing the Ramuné! It's a carbonated soft drink that tastes like bubble gum. You have to make sure you pop out the \"plunger\" to push the marble through. I always finish it up within just a few sips because of how tasty it is! (I hope that makes sense. You can also ask the staff. They'll be able to explain it if you've never tried it before.)

All in all, highly recommend!  Food was great, staff was very friendly and talkative, and they have those awesome carbonated drinks that you gotta try!"}
{"text":"I like this place 
First it's super clean.the food is super fresh and you can feel in every bit 
They need to hire more ppl 
One super nice kid is working there and he loveeee to explain about everything so that's taking to long to order 
The soup was fine ( won't order that again ) 
But the poke was amazing 
Also doesn't make since is if you take one protein is $8.4
2- is $9.4 
But if you take 3 it's $11.4 
Why the jump of the extra $ and it's not that you get more of anything else 
I give it 4 stars bc of the team and the flavor"}
{"text":"Loved this place! I've been waiting for something like this for a while! Spicy tuna is incredible and truly spicy! The staff is great and give generous portions! Def recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome new place for tuna or salmon. Really nice staff. Sides are great and tasteful"}
{"text":"Very good place.  The prices are very good for the product get as well. My dinner consisted of marinated fish and shrimp, white rice and noodle, and a large quantity of vegetables.  The flavors meshed so well together.  My thanks goes to the gentleman that served me.  Very nice and enthusiastic in serving me.  I will be returning to this establishment soon."}
{"text":"Just opened, build your own poke bowls in N Scottsdale!!! Noticed they use higher grade of salmon compared to other places!!! Can definitely see and taste the difference, vegan and gluten fee options are available also!!! Also juices and bottled sodas are from Hawaii! Heard they are going to do Hawaiian style shaved ice soon!"}
{"text":"The concept of this place is similar to Chipotle. You build your bowl as you move through the line! The food is good and the staff was super amazing and helpful. Everything felt fresh and light. I hope this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I was the only one there and even the employees were hiding in the back for about 10 minutes.

Foods just okay but the place does not feel or look or feel clean especially with overflowing cheap plastic topless trash cans and the bathrooms weren't even clean.

Not a very professional place and I hope I don't get sick."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant and their attentiveness to details and Omazing service! The prices are on point and the food is as fresh as I've ever had!! I recommend mixed greens, soba noodles, house spicy, all proteins, and all delicious side toppings!!! This is healthy and re energizes your day to accomplish your health and palate goals!!!! CHEE PONO!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time have poke and it was so delicious! Also the customer service was phenomenal! I would highly recommend going here!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since I saw the sign a few weeks ago. It used to be a salad place that I thought was expensive and not very good. I got the three scoops, two Tina, one salmon, over half white rice and half mixed greens. I had it dressed with traditional and spicy traditional, onions, cucumber, micro greens.  They added seaweed salad and seaweed flakes. It was delicious and the fish tasted fresh and very good. A lot of fish for under $11. Definitely a good bargain. I will be back."}
{"text":"Everything was soo fresh and yummy! Everyone there was so helpful too! So happy it's by my work and i'll be able to visit often! :) check it out!"}
{"text":"Customer service was terrific. Recommend the noodles as your base. Nice to have in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Wow. I've been to some poke spots in the valley but I must say I like this one the best!

Aside from EVERY employee being extremely friendly, the food was beyond this world. I don't think I've EVER had tuna this good in my life (and I've been to VERY expensive places). 

If you're looking for an authentic poke spot with a friendly, CLEAN environment, this is it."}
{"text":"Great poke staff very helpful food was delish! Very fresh lots of ingredients to choose from. Fast friendly service."}
{"text":"Not bad poke spot! This was my first time trying poke spot and it was pretty good. They had a bunch of different toppings to offer. I got tuna and it tasted really fresh. My only complaint is I wish the portions were a bigger. Other than that I will definitely be back to try this again."}
{"text":"Really good flavors! Staff was super helpful with all of the possible choices. Highly recommend to get your poke fix!"}
{"text":"Great Poke! Family owned and good customer service! Hands down will be giving this place my business."}
{"text":"Update 12 days later-
We were so excited to try this place again.  Sadly, we had a different experience. Today, we came in around 11:30am, the owner was helping out a customer in front of us and took time with him (which was expected).  An employee came out to help us and rushed us through the line even though there was only one customer behind us (mind you, she was still looking at the menu). As I was rushed to give this employee my order, he gave me such tiny portions.. so tiny that he literally gave me 4 radish sprouts.  He even removed some off my bowl.  Um ok? Last time I was here, owner gave us generous amounts of every topping. This was very disappointing- to top it off the rice was completely undercooked. Ugh!"}
{"text":"What a great find! Made me feel like I was ordering in Waikiki, and they staff was awesome too. Great variety, fresh, and tasty. Mahalo Tyler! 

Try the Big Kahuna.. won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!  It's a new business but the food is fresh and great, the decor is modern, the service is friendly and excellent.  I travel the West Coast on business weekly and get poke bowls in every city I go to.  Poke Spot takes back seat to none of them!!!"}
{"text":"Best poke place I have ever been to! The staff is wonderful, fish is fresh and place is clean. Highly suggested!!!"}
{"text":"My first time at a Poke restaurant and wow, that was fantastic. Poke spot is clean, had great service, fresh food, and good prices! 
The guy working behind the counter was super helpful, he gave us recommendations and told us about the restaurant. You can choose from a few different sizes, I got a medium. I don't eat fish so I just got two scoops of the tofu (which was very tasty!). My boyfriend tried a few different types of fish and he loved them all. For my bowl I also had brown rice, cucumbers, radish sprouts, avocado, edamame, ginger, seaweed, wontons, and sesame seeds, the guy working there recommended the animal sauce, it was delicious!
Prices aren't bad either, my bowl was like $8 I think which isn't bad for the amount of food I got. We also tried some of the sofas they sold there, I really liked the mango one. I'm lucky this place is right down the street from me but I'm seriously going to be tempted to go all the time now haha!"}
{"text":"Five star service with 2 star food.
So unfortunate their service was really excellent. Friendly and helpful, wish their food was good too.

I had tuna and salmon. Salmon was okay but I think they didn't thaw frozen tuna properly. I know as I purchased a sashimi grade tuna from a grocery store and first time I messed up during thawing process.  If they didn't properly thaw, if they marinated with their house sauce over night, they could have probably saved tuna from tasting watery.  I requested for additional sauce to off-set the watery tuna taste but didn't do as well as I thought.

Price was right. They have 2 scopes and 3 scopes. 

Nice and clean ambiance but really unfortunate about quality of food wasn't there for me on the day I visited.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I live in North Scottsdale and was excited to try this place and not have to drive down to Shea or even further for good Poke. Unfortunately it was a let down so I guess I will just have to continue to commute. I had the tuna and shrimp over white rice and the tuna was not good at all. Also the sauce selection was very limited and the taste of the house sauce I chose was terrible, basically  plain, off brand soy sauce which the employee said was how \"traditional poke\" is supposed to be served. Bummer..."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Very fresh Tuna and lots of selection for toppings.  Felt very healthy and clean.  The owner and workers were very friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Great first visit to this new poke place. Food here is killer good for a lot of reasons but their fish quality is excellent for starts. Salmon is firm and fresh, tastes great and isn't fatty or chewy. Shrimp was as it should be... cooked right and flavorful. Brown rice is cooked right too, seasoned tofu is delicious. The sesame miso sauce goes great with everything in the bowl. Definitely a great eat. 

As for the store and the service, definitely enjoyed my visit. Store is new, clean, great decor, very comfortable and is nice and chill while they build their customer base. Aside from the food being awesome, their service is excellent. They know their ingredients and really seem to listen to feedback. The best thing is that they are friendly. They seem to genuinely want to talk and know you if you are willing to engage and feel welcomed. 

Was excited when I first saw the coming soon sign and now that they are, it's a spot to keep on the top of my lunch list."}
{"text":"Above and beyond any poke places in Scottsdale/Phoenix. This is a locally owned family owned business that takes pride in servicing the customer. The freshest quality ingredients are used, all at a competitive price. I've eaten here over a dozen times and have enjoyed every time."}
{"text":"This is the best poke joint in town! Friendly, clean, delicious. I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Nice clean place with friendly service.  It's a mix and match, build your own kind of place.  3 different kinds of ahi along with octopus, scallops and tofu.  Fish was fresh although it seemed to end up competing with the sauces and spices.  There's a variety of toppings but I think you could go crazy and end up with some strange concoctions such as ahi tuna, crab mix, wasabi and kimchi. Some might see that as a feature.  All in all a good place for poke."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week and loved it! My boyfriend has gone 4x within the last two weeks. We have been wanting a poke place to open in north Scottsdale, so we were super excited when we saw it! The owner is super nice and very hands on. The employees who work there are very helpful too! Definitely recommend:)"}
{"text":"2nd stop on my tour de Poké. First stop was a big disappointment. This spot is far from my house in chandler but I'm a Poké fanatic so I made the trek.  Build your own concept.
1. Soba noodles for my base

2.  Tuna and salmon

3.  Creamy spicy sauce was da bomb

4.  Got all the toppings cause why not

Overall decent place. Place is hard to find. Service was on the slow side. Guava juice I ordered was not good at all. Fish was decent quality but bowls were small compared to others I've tried. I'd go back if I was in the area but it is really not close to anything."}
{"text":"I went in there for the first time yesterday! I am not one to post a lot of positive reviews unless I really hope to see a business succeed. It seems to be a bit of a cursed location with many restaurants with A LOT of turnover. It's a bit poorly placed as it's not super visible to Scottsdale Road, But please- do not let this discourage you from trying it. 
I like to get the half and half (brown rice with mixed veggies) with the scallops and tuna in a spicy creamy sauce! Their food is super fresh and delicious. Plenty of healthy options if you're a health nut and the sky is the limit with what you want to put in your bowl. Two thumbs up for seaweed salad, the fresh avocado, and the roasted seaweed. 
I hope this place succeeds because I love the concept, the food is delicious, the service outstanding. Selfishly, I hope it does not become overcrowded with long lunch waits because this is now my new \"go to\" place!"}
{"text":"If you like sushi you'll love poke. The fish is super tasty and fresh. 

This is probably one of my favorite places for Poke. The fact that they are conveniently located at the corner of Scottsdale Rd and Grayhawk Drive and within walking distance from my home is even better. 

The guys that run this place are super friendly and extremely helpful. They have several choices to select from. They offer countless toppings and sauces. My kids beg to go eat Poke Spot at least once per week. 

This place is simple, FRESH & delicious."}
{"text":"Taylor the owner and his crew at this new, creative eatery are helpful and super friendly. They walk first timers through to get the best poke experience!

The quality of their ingredients is top notch and super fresh. I had a 3 scoop salmon bowl and I also bought a 3 scoop tuna bowl for my wife. Awesome flavor, try the sesame dressing and be sure to add the pickled onions Taylor makes in house! They even have octopus to add to your poke bowl! The Hawaiian sodas are the bomb, with real cane sugar. 

Been there a bunch of times since they opened and plan on eating there a bunch more. Great food and great service. 

Go and get some poke from them, you'll be hooked for sure."}
{"text":"I am so proud of the poke spot! Tyler has the best upbeat energy and is such a fun host. The fish is great quality and the fixings don't disappoint! They have Hawaiian sodas and cool decor. Be sure to see their sister restaurant Wild Tuna."}
{"text":"This is truly the best Poke around.  Amazing food always fresh, great service, family owned and friendly people.  Tyler does a great job taking care of the customers and makes it a great experience overall.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Boring. Bland. Super nice employees and helpful in the process even though I'm a Poke veteran and told them that. Not a lot of stand out options and the fish tasted a little fishy to me. No pun intended. You need to give more options for flavor, and spice, and just double and triple check on the sourcing and handling of the fish prep to ensure freshness. I didn't get sick, and it wasn't bad tasting, but in this business with raw fish, it's a slippery slope."}
{"text":"Compared to the other Poke places in town, you get  really good poke bowl for a great price. Manager went above and beyond on customer service. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Had the Ahi & Salmon over mixed greens, added in a bit of everything from their veggies. Tasted great, really nice quality fish and produce. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First time trying Poke and I was very impressed! You can make your bowl vegan, and it still be a good meal. Lots of toppings and sauces to choose from. Love that they offer brown rice and have avocado. 

The staff was super helpful and friendly too. I ordered for a large group and they were patient and not annoyed at the large order.

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my first time coming here and I found it by accident, Matt has some of the best customer service I have come across! Thanks for the amazing food and awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today after a long hike and we were really hungry. First, the folks who own and work there are incredibly friendly and helpful. Made recommendations for complimentary combinations of proteins and sauces. There were a lot of choices!

They had multiple options for the amount of protein, so my starving son was happy he could load up his bowl. The fish was fresh and really good as was the tofu. Plenty of choices to fill up your bowl. I really liked the miso onion sauce. 

We would highly recommend The Poke Spot - you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood! It was very tasty. Ingredients are top grade. Staff is friendly, place is clean and has a great vibe. 

Update: I really, really, really want to like this place. It's a great location for me, staff is wonderful, fish is terrific. However, I have gone numerous times since they opened and it doesn't seem to be on the right path. Toppings don't compete with other Poke places in town. It's slow at times and somewhat confusing with how they prepare things and really not that consistent. I want to be their cheerleader but think they need to check out competition just to see what people are enjoying elsewhere. I am still rooting for you though!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I are addicted to Poke. We decided to stop in here as it is next door to her school.  The service was good. Prices were okay.  Food was so-so. We both got the hawaiian tuna and spicy tuna.  The hawaiian tuna was a bit bland and the spicy tuna was more spice than tuna.  Overall it was okay.  I wouldn't run out to go here."}
{"text":"Primo 
Soba noodles 
Spicy ahi, cucumbers, radish sprouts, green onions,
Spicy traditional sauce topped with edamame, kimchi, wasabi, and mango. 
Tyler is awesome.  definitely a super Rad person. Makes this food spot even better 
#Pokespot #Yum"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed poke spot . Very fresh tuna and ingredients . They also offered things like kimchi . Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Yummy fresh fish wrapped in sauces and noodles or rice of your choosing. Tasty Hawaiian treat for landlocked Arizona!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. The owner is awesome. Remembers me and my entire family when we come in. Very gracious. The poke bowls are great. The fish is extremely fresh. Love the salmon! They always get your bowl just right and compared to some other poke joints the prices are reasonable and the quantities more than filing. 

I've been there dozens of times and it doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try the food, that I forgot to take a picture of it!  The food was fantastic! The textures, colors, and blend of taste just made my tastebuds explode with glee!  And very important they offered gluten free and dairy free sauces for those like me. Finally, the service was exceptional, and as their slogan says... \"Broke the mouth but not the wallet!  I highly recommend Poke Spot."}
{"text":"I'm pretty happy right now. Poke is currently in my rotation of favorite foods and I now have a spot that is at least somewhat near my house, not terrible, and is reasonably priced (as far as poke is concerned). 

Pros: The place is clean, well lit, Tyler is super friendly and is very concerned with making sure the customers are satisfied. All ingredients seemed fresh and were delicious. The ordering process is simple enough. They make the bowl pretty quick, so if you are hangry, they have the medicine for you, and your frown will soon turn upside-down. 

Cons: So minor, but as silly as it may seem, there was no \"crab\". I have enjoyed a scoop in every other poke bowl I have had except here, and it's possibly low rent (is it?), but is just an option that I am used to having. Also, I don't know if they will have rushes (I hope they are prosperous and do gangbusters), but I can see the seating being an issue if there are multiple parties larger than 2.

So, in summary: If you are a poke lover, or a first timer, I highly recommend this place. If you want the sushi experience without the wait or fanfare, this is the spot. They do a great job and as Tyler told me, they representing poke in this corner of the valley (and doing a great job of it).  Please patronize this place, because I appreciate that they are likely on the front end of an upcoming \"poke craze\" here in the valley, so I'd like to see them rewarded and open a branch in Deer Valley (wink wink)."}
{"text":"This place is SO amazingly good, and Tyler was beyond friendly and helpful. There are plenty of fresh, mouth-watering options so no matter what kind of bowl you create you can't go wrong! I used to live in Hawaii about eight years ago, and this place brought me back as if no time had passed at all. I'll definitely be bringing my friends here asap."}
{"text":"First time having a poke bowl. Had ahi and tofu over sobs noodles. It was great! The staff was really helpful and friendly as well. Will def be coming back."}
{"text":"Being a self proclaimed lover of Poke, It's about gosh dang time a poke spot opened up in my hood! I was out to dinner the other night when a couple told me that they had seen signs for a poke spot that was going to be opening soon. Lo and behold, today I was up that way getting gas when I went to go see if the news was true and if so when would they be opening?! Well to my surprise, THEY WERE OPEN! 

Walking in the décor reminds me of a cute little Hawaiian spot, surf boards on the wall a drink case filled with some Hawaiian drinks and two awesome and welcoming dudes working behind the counter. Apparently, they have been open a little under a week - six days to be exact! They walked me through the menu and helped me create my own poke masterpiece. 

I went with half and half of white rice and mixed greens, topped them off with some tuna and salmon added in some sweet onions, radish sprouts, cucumbers, sesame seeds, roasted seaweed, and avocado and had it tossed with of their sesame miso onion dressing. Took the bad boy to go and enjoyed my delicious creation at work! 

They are off to a good start, just wish they had a couple extra toppings like masago, cilantro, green onion and I wish they chopped up their jalapeno a little more - right now they offer it as sliced and that can sometimes be a little spicy for my personal preference.

Loved that they offer the option on Soba Noodles for a dollar extra, I am looking forward to trying that in the future! For a huge portion, I was out the door for $12.00 and that's with the avocado up charge, but smaller bowls start at $8.90.

I hope this place does well, it's exactly what this area needs. Also, place is a little hidden in the shopping center, but it's located right next to Cold Beer & Cheese Burgers.

Must try!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. I am here at least 3 times a week... after coming here, none of the other poke spots compare in flavor or quality. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I absolutely love this spot! we drive here from phoenix all the time.
The food is a 10/10 and the owner is absolutely incredible. 
I will always choose this poke spot!

I get the animal sauce and is too die for!"}
{"text":"I love poke but what I love about this place is the customer service! Everyone is super friendly and happy!"}
{"text":"Love Poke Spot. The guys are so nice and personable. They always make an effort to remember you and make you feel like family. Love getting the ahi with animal sauce. So good!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. Tyler made us feel welcome, and it was a pleasure to see how well he knew his regulars. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great staff, amazing food and good location. Tyler is always helping us along with his father, they are absolutely amazing. I will keep on coming here!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for poke bowl! Food tastes very fresh and the customer service was friendly and attentive. Try the seaweed salad."}
{"text":"I'm a huge sushi fan, and this restaurant didn't exactly sweep me off my feet. First thing I noticed the minute I walked in, the place was SO F*CKIN HOT. The last thing I want to do is eat sushi in a hot restaurant, where it's supposed to be kept cold and fresh. The ambience of the restaurant was off as well. The music was weird and you could barely hear it. I was greeted by a nice gentlemen and I told him it was my first time there, so he tried his best to walk me through everything. I asked a lot of questions, so I don't know if he was just shy, or maybe I just intimidated him....bottom line, not a great first experience."}
{"text":"First time having Poke was at this location. Staff was very helpful. Salmon was excellent."}
{"text":"Ordered the 2 protein option $8.90; they also have a 3 protein option. Choices- salmon, tuna, scallops, tofu and shrimp. I went with salmon and tuna with half greens and half brown rice. They also offer white rice. They then dress that portion of your order with a sauce- they recommended the house sauce, which is a soy based sauce. I would like to try the spicy creamy one next go around. Then you're able to add veggies and other toppings. I went to edamame, wonton strips,  cucumbers and seaweed salad. The portion size is great. I left full but not stuffed. The two guys working were very helpful! I think one was the owner. I took my meal outside, and he made the extra effort to come out and ensure I was enjoying my bowl. It's a nice healthy option for North Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"So so good! Such personal service. I know right, at a poke shop? But it's true. Try this place!"}
{"text":"Poke is my favorite! Just moved to the area and the Poke Spot is  my favorite sauce is a wasabi sauce and a spicy traditional, Tyler will hook up your taste buds just the way you like it the Ahi is super fresh and cubed perfect for each bite"}
{"text":"Super tasty. Really enjoy the soba noodle option. The place is clean and trendy!! Lots of options to sit. ALSOOOOOO the sauces are great!"}
{"text":"Living in Hawai'i for the past 3 decades, it is really hard to find fresh ahi here in the valley. If I didn't catch it fresh, my neighbor would and share. 

The ahi here has been frozen to be point that it was a light pink and not a deep red. The texture, which is important in poke, was dry and stringy.

Nothing special, at least for this local hawaiian boi."}
{"text":"My brother and I have been going here since it opened. We were really excite to see it open because we love poke. We go around once a week since we live near by and we love it. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in one week. Very fresh and awesome for a light lunch. Their Hawaiian Ahi and Crab are amazing. Love the soba noodles with the traditional sauce. Highly recommend. Friendly staff and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"The first thing I do when I visit Hawaii is get a poke bowl. So when I saw this place I had to give it a try- even though I am usually disappointed when on the mainland. 

When I walked into this little shop I was pleased by the fresh decor and saw the fresh ingredients for myself. I met one of the owners, Aaron, a local sushi chef. He mixed me up a bowl with tuna and scallops. The fish was fresh and had a wonderful mild flavor highlighted by seasoning that rivaled any in Hawaii. 

I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Went in and asked the owner what he would get in his bowl. It was awesome, I went here because I love the sushi restaurant on thunderbird called \"Wild Tuna\".  This place is also excellent.  Good job guys!!!"}
{"text":"My cousin recommended me this place and it's the only poke place I know so far to offer soba noodles and it's the most amazing thing. I would be here everyday if I could and the staff is super helpful, nice and friendly. I was so awkward about ordering and they were really patient with me. Top notch customer service and food :)"}
{"text":"I've tried other poke places and they're good but this place is great! You can tell the good quality of the ingredients. I like to do a rice salad mix & they dress the salad, a nice touch. I love that we now have an easy, healthy grab-n-go up here & it's poke, even better! I'd just like to see them trade out that styrofoam for something more green and nontoxic."}
{"text":"Ono kine grinds in North Scottsdale.     I'm born and raised in Hawaii and this hit da spot.  I'm a hairstylist at Taglio Salon and I referred all of my foodie coworkers to try this place out.    They all loved it but then was disappointed because they were out of lots of ingredients today.    I will definitely be back because it's Aloha~~"}
{"text":"Wow, the staff is so friendly here!! They always remember us when we go in. They have great food and I eat here a lot because it fits in with my strict diet.  You pick a base such as rice, salad, noodles or meatballs. Then you add a fish such as tuna, salmon or crab. Then you can pick your dressing and additional sides."}
{"text":"Totally stoked when the Poke Spot opened up in our area. Super awesome place for poke. Staff is super friendly and if you're new to eating poke they will explain it all to you. If you love poke but your kids don't, don't worry, they added a kid friendly menu for the little ones. 

I get the brown rice base, the tuna and ALL the fixings. Don't forget the crab salad, hands down the best addition to the poke bowl. Their fish is fresh, their toppings are purchased in town (support local!) 

Cool vibe, love the surfboard on the wall. They also offer punch cards so you get a bowl on the house after you use up the card.

They keep it fresh and simple, exactly how Poke is suppose to be.

Check it out....you're going to love it."}
{"text":"What a great atmosphere truly a professionally ran business father and son support your locals.
Had a primo bowl it was amazing."}
{"text":"Poke is not as fresh as koi. Koi poke is my new favorite place, the service was bad. The place was not very clean, the music was bad. Overall was not a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"People were very friendly. Place was very clean. Food and fish were fresh and cold. In my opinion the cost verse the serving size was a little lacking. I would try it again."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here! I wish their portions were a little bigger for the big kahuna size. I got the salmon, spicy tuna, and scallops with white rice. The owner was super nice and made my spicy tuna spicier! 

Although the food is good, the glass in front of the food is WAYYY too high so I did have a really hard time ordering! Other than that, I will probably go back since it's really close where I work and the price isn't bad!"}
{"text":"10/10 recommend this place! Employees are so nice and super polite, which isn't too easy to come across nowadays. They have so many options for your bowl and they have great recommendations for what to add and what not to. All around delicious and clean poke at an affordable price with a great staff as a bonus!"}
{"text":"Literally the best lunch I've had in a year.  Poke Bowl 2 scoops on spring mix.  Tyler was awesome.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went to poke spot for first time tonight after hearing about my friends going all the time. I loved it and will be going here for poke bowl instead of sushi places when craving sushi. You build your own bowl and I did the three scoops of sushi and was just as filling as 2 to 3 sushi rolls. Best thing about that is it was only 10 bucks and got to put what I wanted. It was super fresh, clean inside and staff very friendly in explaining how it works! Can't wait to go back! Yum, yum!"}
{"text":"Great place. I was impressed with the quality and freshness of the fish. The tuna and salmon were great, and I also love the traditional spicy sauce and the toppings. I just wish they had yellowtail as part of their selection, as I really think that would be a great addition. 

The staff is super friendly and the prices are very reasonable. It is conveniently located in Grayhawk, literally right down the street from my house. I highly recommend Poke Spot!"}
{"text":"Awesome poke spot. Food is fresh and tasty. Definitely hits the spot. Would come back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"These guys are the bomb. Not only is the food fresh and tasty..but they are super helpful and friendly. Super customer service. Always remember that you have visited before. 
Great selections of proteins and toppings and always have suggestions of new combos to try. My fave is the Hawaiian Ahi. Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I was helped by Tyler, a very kind and talkative (in a good way!) employee. He seemed to be the only one working at the time, but he was very helpful and answered all my questions. He explained what poke is, and the process of making your bowl. The food was fresh and yummy! The prices are reasonable and you get unlimited add-ons, which is awesome! I love poke!"}
{"text":"Pretty impressed here! Perfect for a quick lunch at a reasonable price. Their salmon is high grade too! Great service and I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious place - neighborhood spot. I will be back tons! Got two scoops of protein atop spring mix with tons of mi in's and toppings for less than $11! Mmm will be back lots and will recommend to friends and family alike. The owners, Tyler and his dad are so nice!"}
{"text":"Out of the Poke places I've tried in Phoenix/Scottsdale, Poke Spot is now my favorite. The fish and salad greens were very fresh, the rice was well cooked, and the staff were all very friendly. I really liked the ahi poke which was already marinated in the traditional Hawaiian soy marinade and they have a few other sauce options if you want to be more creative. They also use freshly sliced avocado, rather than a mashed avocado, which a different poke joint uses. Prices are fair for what you get and you can choose how many scoops of fish you want. Poke spot is definitely a great lunch or quick dinner option."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this gem on accident while my fiancé and I were looking for a quick bite to eat. We quickly pulled into this shopping center seeing the typical quick bite joints, however were side tracked by the poke sign. We decided we'd try it out since 1. We're not from the area, and 2. We hadn't had poke in a while. As soon as we walked in we were greeted as they were busy making bowls for a few customers in front of us. Once it was our turn, the guy introduced himself as Tyler and asked if we had visited before. We told him this was our first time and he thanked us for stopping in and explained the process. He was beyond nice the entire time, and made some delicious suggestions as well. We were both very pleased with our selections of a two scoop half salad half rice and a two scoop all rice. The fish was fresh, and all the flavors were great. Tyler even encouraged feedback and asked us to be like Gordon Ramsey and rip into him if there was something we weren't pleased with lol. Every time we are in this area we will make sure to stop by! 

Ideally, you guys will open another location in the tempe/chandler area! :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. And the staff are so enthusiastic and helpful I love it! They also have so many options for meat eaters and for those that don't. I personally and vegan and this place really catered to my needs."}
{"text":"When I first stopped in here shortly after they opened, I ended up walking out. There was a family of 4 in front of me and they literally took like over 10 minutes to get their order. Also glanced at their poke toppings and options looked very limited. 
Due to some good reviews from my Yelp friends, I thought I'd give them another chance yesterday. Instead of eating there, I asked my hubby to bring some take outs. He came back with something amazing. The fish was fresh and they had far more options than before. The employee stated that they did in fact added more options. I was also flabbergasted that they had 'kimchee' as a topping. 
Overall, it was really good and since this poke spot is closer to home, I will be eating here more frequently."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff that went above and beyond.  The chef offered to put leftovers in the fridge until we were ready to leave.  Food was fresh and very filling.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Pretty decent poke at Poke Spot - fresh fish and the usual plethora of ingredients for a poke restaurant. Pick your fish, bed of rice, salad, or both, and then pile up tasty toppings like mango, sprouts, pickled cucumbers, avocado, and crab, and douse the whole thing with yummy dressing - a top notch lunch. 

Nice staff, clean dining room - I'm docking them 1-star for not having any high chairs or booster seats for my son - I get that poke isn't the typical breakfast of champions for kiddos, but I just feel that it's an oversight to not have those.

Keep bringing the poke to the people, Poke Spot!"}
{"text":"Was headed to a different place for lunch but then saw this place, glad I decided to stop here instead! It was fairly busy when I walked in but totally worth the wait. Everything was fresh, they were not stingy with any ingredients, will be back here many times!"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best service in town! Competitively priced with other poke restaurants around. Very excited to finally have a poke joint near home! Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Awesome location. Of every poke spot I've tried in PHX, this one gives the largest portions of fish! Simple, fresh ingredients that make a delicious bowl!"}
{"text":"Super uber tasty poke bowl. Lots of Hawaiian influence with a great local feel. Love all the choices! Def coming back soon and often"}
{"text":"I had lunch here last week and got the salmon and octopus on top of white rice and mixed greens. The staff recommended a mix between the traditional poke sauce and one of the spicy sauces for the octopus and it was very tasty! I will definitely return to try more of their menu options."}
