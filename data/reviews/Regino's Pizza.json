{"text":"is hard to earn my approval for pizzas, as I'm tired of eating pizza.
but this place has a unique taste"}
{"text":"After looking around for a new pizza joint for a while I figured I would give this place a try. I was so fed up with pizza pizza the quality was sub par and by the time it got to my place it was always cold and it never tasted that great like fake cheese, etc.

I really had high hopes from reginos pizza because the reviews were pretty great.

Medium Hawaiian pizza, 11 wings, 2 diet cokes for $25. I called and ordered delivery it took about 50 minutes. Within 30 minutes they had called me to let me know they had made a mistake with my order (they tossed my wings in hot sauce instead of it being on the side) which is okay with me even though it wasn't what I wanted but I was starving so I didn't want it to take longer for them to redo the wings lol. Pizza was AWESOME :) Still cheaper than pizza pizza and the quality was great! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Fast delivery, prices are good. As for the pizza itself... Its obviously way better than Pizza Pizza.  Not the best, but then no delivery pizza in Toronto is good.  Decent enough!"}
{"text":"We ordered a Hawaiian pizza and the  quality is really good the pizza tasted really fresh. We had delivery for a medium (which is also same price as a small for delivery) and it took about half an hour or even less and it was 19.71 including two creamy garlic dippings!  Definetely recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to order online for their special. The website is down. It directed us to call to make the order. I called the store and they did not honour the special. They gave me a number to call the headquarters to order but it redirected me back to the store. Nothing was resolved. Very disappointing because they have good pizza. Just lacking some customer service."}
{"text":"Great pizza spot in Thornhill. Good service and better prices.
The owner of this pizza store is a great guy too and a recognizable face in Thornhill."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza with chicken[halal] pineapple mushroom black olives and hot peppers and I have to say the pizza was delicious. Will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Have ordered a large Hawaiian pizza on two occasions over the weekend due to sheer laziness and not wanting to go out in the cold weather.   The pizza was good, and service was quick so I have nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"We ordered a slice at the Brimley location in Scarborough and was not impressed.

We decided to give the chain another chance because of good experiences I've had with the brand at work and also thinking that a fresh order would improve the experience.

This little plaza was quite dead when we came on a Saturday on Thanksgiving weekend near 5:15 pm. We actually thought it was closed and the food court was but Reginos was open.

We did a $10.99 large 3-topping walk-in pick up with two dipping sauces. They said it was okay to order 2 different sets of 3 toppings which was nice as it let us try two pizzas for the price of one.

The pizza was ready in 15 minutes. We tried a little in the car and it was great but unfortunately we had to take it home which was 20 minutes away, so it cooled down when we got it back to the house. However, a few minutes in the toaster oven revived it well.

Once properly reheated and piping hot, it was great. I'm sure if we ate it right there and then it would have been delicious as well. We were looking for something tasty and we definitely got that.

It did not blow me away but this is an excellent pizza place at a decent price. We don't eat pizza often but given the price and our previous experience, we will definitely be a repeat customer.

I still would not expect anything fresh if you buy a slice from any pizza place. It might still be good as next-day heated-up pizza which can be just as good as the day of, but it probably has been sitting around longer than you wish."}
{"text":"Imagine dominos pizza but with better dough, toppings, cheese, pizza sauce and more of everything. 

I ordered Regino's meat supreme pizza. Asked them if they could put beef on only one side and they did it no problem! 
It was my first time ordering, I was shocked. Amazing pizza! 

Toppings were plentiful, fresh and full of flavour. It wa bacon, pepperoni and ground beef. I was a bit disappointed at first at the lack of pepperoni but then I realized it was on the bottom! Other pizza places don't think of this but it makes sense. If you put the pepperoni on top the other toppings won't stick because it's on the pepperoni instead of the cheese! 

Lots of cheese and the dough was really soft, crust was crunchy on the outside but fluffy on the inside. The cheese was thick and toppings were large and more plentiful than other pizza places. 

Price is amazing too. It was $12 for a medium meat supreme pizza (pepperoni, bacon, beef). This was at regular price. It's regular crust is already a pan thick pizza and there's options to have an ever thicker crust or thinner. As well as adjusting sauce and quantity of sauce. 

There's absolutely nothing wrong with this pizza. Everyone who tried it loved it and asked where it was from! 

Long story short this is my new go to pizza place."}
{"text":"I ordered my pizzas for delivery. The delivery guy did not use navigation and could not find his way to my place. He was 20 minutes late. He called me and I basically guided him to my place over the phone for 10 minutes. When he arrived, he told me that I got one of the street names wrong while guiding him. I felt he took this to blame his lateness on me. The entire experience was very unpleasant. I do not wish to order delivery from them again. The pizzas were still good for what it's worth."}
{"text":"Nothing more to be said - best pizza place ever! I've consistently come to this place for pizza for 3 years and it's now time to write a review. True, the general exterior of this store is not very appealing - it's located in a beat down plaza with an acupuncture place, driving school and pub - but don't judge a book by it's cover! 

The prices are extremely reasonable and the quality is always spot on. My parents have digestion troubles with pizza from larger franchises (*cough cough Pizza Pizza, Pizza Hut*) but this place is a favourite for all of us. 

I've ordered delivery once, but I don't recommend it. Yes, the pizza was still good but I live a 5 minute driving distance away and the pizza still took an hour to arrive - I kid you not. Service has always been consistently mediocre and nothing to complain about. In fact, if you call to place your order, I think they keep your name and number on hand because the next time you call and give your number, they already know your name? 

Highly recommended! :-)"}
{"text":"Walked in hungry for a quick bite. 

Guy doing something in kitchen asked if I was an Uber driver and I said no I'm just hungry. 

He went back to doing what he was doing and another guy walked up to him also ignoring me.

I waited a bit. 

I got hungrier. 

I debated waiting some more, decided politeness was for satiated stomachs and decided to act.

I loudly said \"if you're too busy I can go elsewhere but I'm hungry\" and they didn't move to help me or ask what I was looking for and continued to ignore me so I walked out. 

Don't plan on going back in 

(Note: this entire thing happened in under 4 minutes but I knew there are other places in the plaza to go so I just left since they seemed uninterested in my business)"}
{"text":"Food is hot and fresh.  I am not a pizza person,  but as they go Regino's is good. 

Don't overlook their combos which have a lot of variety  beyond pizza and wings,  such as their saucy 'n'  side dish combo  with Baked Lasagna!  (which is very good) 

On the service side,  I once picked up dinner on the way home,  but left the bag with garlic bread in it behind.  

They looked me up and delivered it to me!  Awesome service!"}
{"text":"Love how they do their wings. Pizza is average... They're not too stingy on the toppings and the people there are usually nice. It's too bad the pizza and wings combo isn't available with the small pizza anymore though. It seems like the deals were much better when they just opened up. Oh well :("}
{"text":"This was a great place when they opened up. Food was always fresh and service was great, but since it came under new management we have observed a quality drop in customer service and flavour. 
It's now a hit or miss when we order. Pizza arrives cold or the order was incorrectly documented."}
{"text":"The place doesn't look like much but the pizza is excellent. We ordered our favourite, a 3 topping pizza with tomatoes, green peppers, and mushrooms. This pizza was meaty, juicy, yet surprisingly not soggy! The slice had a nice bite, nice chunky dough where it counts, and a thin crispy crust, just the way I like it. 

We took advantage of their twin pizza deal, for 20 bucks we got 2 mediums with 3 toppings each, that's a pretty good deal. The 2nd pizza was of course another favourite, just pepperoni with extra cheese. They did a fine job and passed with flying colours.

I found this to be a nice convenient location as I'm travelling across York region on my way home from work. It's nestled in the middle of nice quiet neighbourhood so you don't have to deal with heavy traffic. I bet the locals order from here all the time.

Good job, Reginos, I'll be back to try the wings next time."}
{"text":"Really good pizza, even if you're getting a slice they seem to be fresh and not dried out.  i've been to this one in Markham and one in Aurora where i live now and they were both excellent.  Looks like a pretty good chain, i wish them well....people are always friendly too.   This location is in a food court but the one in Aurora has no seats just some stools against the window.  They have really good prices for slices, haven't ordered a whole pie yet.  But like i said, slices here aren't dried out or lacking toppings.  Definately recommend Regino's."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza place in town.  Great price too.  Pickup and delivery are fast.  Bacon strips are recommended and they are always generous with the toppings.  If you want try something a little different with your pizza get their Region's special sauce dip."}
{"text":"It is the best pizza spot for quality and quantity; the dough isn't too thick and toppings are plentiful  great bang for your buck and the manager and staff are always pleasant!!"}
{"text":"Piping hot, fresh and delicious! I've ordered here before, but this was hubby's first time, and he was blown away!"}
{"text":"I was hungry and could not sleep so I started looking at pizza delivery places at Yelp near Liberty Suites at Yonge. I ordered online and I called to confirm to ensure that they have received my order. I'm glad they still deliver since I ordered after 11p and they close at midnight. The pizza was very good and the wings \"HEAVENLY.\" I ordered it well done. Not over cooked at all but crispy. So whoever was in charged of cooking the wings on the night of 5/26, keep up the good work! The hot sauce blended very well with the wings. I ordered it separate since I did not want my wings to be soggy and I want to appreciate the crispiness of these wings and I sure did! Delivery was as expected approx 30 min and I paid with credit card. They have the portable credit card equipment to take the payment. Overall, I wished I would have known about this place sooner but we are leaving Toronto in the morning. My husband wanted more wings but they are now closed. If they were still open, we would've ordered more of these wings."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the neighborhood. Always fresh and very generous toppings. Deals are great. $11.29 for a medium pizza. You can ask for different type of crust and half-half topping combinations. They are pretty flexible on that."}
{"text":"Great pizza great prices. You wouldn't expect such great pizza from a place like this. There are many other options to get a bite near this place (i.e. At yonge and steeles) but don't be fooled! One of the best pizzas I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Awesome gluten free pizza! 
Delivery time was so quick and they were so generous with their toppings. 
Definitely will order again!"}
{"text":"One of one go to pizza places. Good amount of toppings on pizza and always fresh and hot. However, couple times when I asked for extra pizza sauce on the pizza, there was little to no pizza sauce on the pizza in comparison to having regular amount of pizza sauce. I realized this after picking up the pizza and return home. Now I never ask for extra sauce as I am scared they will again put little to no pizza sauce on and be disappointed. Other then that, pizza is good but too bad when I ask for extra sauce they never put extra sauce."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Toronto.
Only place i'll ever by pizza. Owners/staff are friendly, everything is fresh, and great prices.
A gem not only in Thornhill, but all of Toronto. 

Please keep up the quality and the great pizza!"}
{"text":"I've been searching for a great pizza place and finally found one. The whole family loves their pizzas. And a big plus for me ... I have an allergy to gluten and they serve the best gluten free pizza anywhere. Great pizza, great value. Check out their Manager and Daily specials for maximum value. Prompt and professional service. Try the Clark and Henderson location in Thornhill, you'll be very pleased!"}
{"text":"FOOD: I ordered a small vegetarian pizza with 3 toppings with a Dipping sauce. The pizza was really good and filling. Soft and very chewy. 

PLACE: I ordered the pizza online and went to pick it up. It was confusing to see where the store actually is. It's inside of a food plaza where you have to go in and walk towards the end to end up at the store. The store itself is small and the rest of plaza was packed with students from the school across. 

PRICE: Reasonable. A small vegetarian pizza with 3 toppings with a Dipping sauce was $12.25"}
{"text":"Lots of toppings, great price and quality. Would recommend. Best pizza in the area. Only concern is sodium. Very thirsty after done eating."}
{"text":"The place does not look that appealing but the pizza is scrumptious, the workers are friendly and the price couldn't be better! 

I live on Bayview and Steeles and was growing tired of the pizza pizza on Steeles and Leslie.  A few of my friends recommended that I try Regino's and we're actually suprised that I had not been to this place sooner... and I agree with them! This is now my go to location for good pizza (especially around exam times!) 
They don't have delivery, and it is just a take out location but if you're having a bunch of people over, the trip is well worth it!"}
{"text":"I like another location of Regino's Pizza so I tried ordering from this location today.  

When the pizza arrived and I took a bite out of a slice, the dough was still wet and not cooked thoroughly.  I called to ask about this and the person that answered the phone told me there are 100s of pizza in the oven.  He wasn't very fluent in English but I took it as that they are busy and can't meet the standards expected of a pizza.  (A standard which, personally, isn't very high.  I just like my pizza cooked)

After the fruitless phone conversation, I had to put the pizza in the oven and cook it myself.  I could have saved myself the time and have a better meal by buying a frozen pizza from the grocery store."}
{"text":"Nice pizza at a very reasonable price.  They have different deals in their store for almost everyday.

I will suggest to order a whole pizza, not to buy their sliced pizza.  They made the whole pizza fresh for you and (of course) it tastes so much better.

Friendly staff, and they always helped me to decide my toppings on my pizza :-D"}
{"text":"Good old pizza place with great pizzas and extras. Cheaper than pizza pizza and better quality."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

This is a rather unassuming pizza joint in Markham, in a plaza mall across from Brother Andre Secondary. I can tell this place gets popular with students during the afternoon since there's a long list of deals in the store menu.

I came here to order two pizzas for dinner, as I wanted to try a place that wasn't the usual Pizza Hut/Pizza/Nova chain. The pizza was prepared fresh and took about 15 minutes for it to be ready, which was about what I expected.

For a small size, the pizza was still quite big. I would expect a small to be good for one person, but I was only able to finish half of it. Regardless, the pizza was delicious, yet not as greasy compared to the chain brands. The ingredients were also fresh, and for about $20 for 2 smalls it was definitely worth the price.

The employees inside were very good and provide excellent service. They are all knowledgeable about the menu and will accommodate any allergies one may have.

Considering the fact I live near this pizza joint, I will likely add this to the list of pizza places I would order from."}
{"text":"Best priced pizza I find - 12.99 online special for A mega sized pizza. 
Pizza is great, wouldn't recommend getting their wings or wedges tho. 
Halal pepperoni as a topping is a major plus for me - keeps me returning!"}
{"text":"Superb pizza. For a change we want pizza for Sunday brunch. Regino's is a great surprise. The cheese, sauce, toppings and dough are in perfect proportion. The only growth point is that the pineapple on the pizza was not drained to dry enough so the pizza was a bit too wet. Rest is all good. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Last time I had Regino's was about a year ago, and it was pretty good.  They are not cheap on toppings.
The have some good deals, just look on their website. The combo with wedges were pretty good.


I did try ordering from the scarborough location, and it was not the same. It was pretty bad from there.

I know that Franklin P.S school orders from here for the pizza lunch.  They been ordering from here for years!! Kids love it."}
{"text":"Wanted a change from a chain and this place was highly recommended. It's good pizza - but nothing really stood out, sauce was nice, dough was ...doughy, I do like the pepperoni they use as well. I got my usual Pepperoni pizza on thin crust, cooked well done and everything came out the way it was supposed to. I think next time, I'll get regular crust just to see the difference.
*Edited to add that I tried the regular crust, and it made such a difference! It was light and delicious. Definitely getting regular crust from now on, the ratios of everything was perfect.
I was able to quickly create an online profile and placed my order through their website. That was pretty nice, especially for those of us that are phone-avoiders!
Prices were right around what I was expecting. I'll maybe try their wings next time too!
Great alternative place if you're tired of the same old Pizza Pizza."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience!! I order here all the time... Haven't moved and all of a sudden they don't deliver to my address.  The girl on the phone taking the order was either deaf or couldn't speak English.  I had to repeat everything 5 times only to be told they don't deliver to my address of which they have been delivering to for the last three years.    Oh well... You just lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Hot fresh pizza. Lots of topic selection and you can order online. Much better than some of the alternatives in the area. My go to place for a quick pizza."}
{"text":"T hills fav pizza. Great people. Great wheels. Love me a nice Reginos pie and can't beat those prices!"}
{"text":"Once again. Generous toppings price point very reasonable. Crust is edible. Great service. I usually order ahead and walk-in pickup. Best pizza joint around."}
{"text":"Very delicious pizza and worthy to wait 20minutes. Chicken wings is not so good as Pizza."}
