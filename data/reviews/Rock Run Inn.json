{"text":"Had a Baby Shower here. Everything went so smoothly.  Helen is great to work with along with her staff. They all did a fantastic job to make the event a huge success."}
{"text":"I can not say enough about Butler's golf course (Rock Run Inn)! We had our wedding reception there and they couldn't have made it more beautiful!! They did all the work. Helen was so personable and made sure we covered all the angles. Sonny made the room absolutely beautiful with class and taste! Al is a wonderful chef, not only was the food delicious but also picturesque.   The rest of the staff, bartenders and servers alike also deserve a huge THANK YOU for making our evening magical!!

{"text":"For the fourth straight year I have held a 36 guy, 36 hole golf outing here and each year they keep getting better. Great people, great service, great food. Helen and Cody did all we've asked of them to make it another special day. Cant wait to come back again next year."}
{"text":"Great service! Excellent food! Doesn't look like much from the outside but don't let it fool you. I had outstanding crab cakes over grilled veggies. My sister had the bruschetta stuffed portobello mushrooms over grilled veggies. Truly delicious, not to mention gluten free! And my daughter had the chicken tacos. Yummy! We were visiting family. We are from Chicago so we know good food when we taste it. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"4/6/2017 WOW! REAL CHANGE! I  have returned several times this Spring and am happy to say there have been great changes in the menu, food and service. My visits have been with 2-5 others. Everyone enjoyed the food and service. The new menu is more sophisticated and well presented. There are kids items and specials that rise above the ordinary. A plus for Elizabeth Township. Congratulations to the chef and staff.   2/5/2016 A very sad restaurant. I received a Rock Run Inn flyer today. Friday's special: \"Large Fish Sandwich\". On arrival we were told to 'Sit anywhere you can find a place'. No hello. Booths were dirty and littered as was the floor. Menus delayed. Finally fish sandwiches were ordered. 45 minutes until we received the fish 'special' (without cocktail sauce and with tasteless rubber fries) Meanwhile the two waitresses ran every way. One proclaimed \"...the refrigerator broke so a lot of food spoiled and had to be thrown in the garbage!\" Upon leaving we consoled ourselves with the fact that at least we got a good story to tell! Recommendations: 1. Close now! 2. Hire a consultant to totally rebuild the restaurant function ground up.  3. Clean and renovate the shabby interior.   I was there a year ago and hoped things would improve. Things got worse...much worse.  I've visited almost every restaurant in Elizabeth Township. All (except Driscoll's) are cursed by an averageness that makes it wise to eat at home or take the time to drive to Pittsburgh for a decent meal.  Good luck to Rock Run Inn in its uncertain future."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the menu selection, upbeat staff, and good food.  Ordered chicken with Portabella's, sauce, served with Redskin mashed potatoes.  Chili, Fish and fries served with A balsamic dressing.  Everything was very tasty.  Look forward to my next visit.  Update:  My following visits over the past year haven't been as pleasant... We've been served burnt apps and burgers, the menu has declined and when we held my daughters graduation party there bartenders set up and opened a bar in our room then another group invaded my daughter's graduation party, they also permitted them to set their grab bags on her cake table while we still had guests (and another hour remaining)...we and our guests felt forced to leave. I feel that they are poorly managed."}
{"text":"I go there every friday for there fish, it is fantastic.  The fish is so moist, and the beer batter is perfect. I ordered there larger fish and it was enough to feed 2 people. The service and staff is great. I am having my sons graduation party here in june. Such a great hidden gem."}
