{"text":"I love their buffalo wings, and the fact that they're halal. But what really bothers me is that they change the delivery fees every time I call. Like earlier today I was ordering and she goes \"We can't deliver to this address it's too far\" and I'm like \"I've ordered before though\" and then she goes like \"5$ delivery charge\" LIKE FIVE DOLLARS FOR WHAAAT it's like not even 10 minutes of drive from my place and she told me it would talk an hour.
I was extremely pissed, I hung up. 

Also, one time, I called and she took like 10 minutes to take my order, and then she goes \"sorry it's closing time I can't take your order\" when it clearly says on the flyer that it's open until midnight...

I like their food, but they need to improve their service"}
{"text":"One of the only decent pizza places I've been too. Their pizzas do not contain plastic toppings lol and they're 100% halal. Very good price, great for students. They've made a lot of good changes since opening and the delivery fee is only $1.50 if you live farther than 5 km which is pretty nice."}
{"text":"Pretty good wings, comparable to buffalo bills, but not quite as good, but close enough.  

What I liked: good wings, almost as good as Buffalo bills.

What I don't like:  
- The Pizza, wasn't very good, and the toppings tasted very plastic and low quality.
- All the nickel and dime they do.. EX. making up different delivery fees every time I call, charging 1.00 when using my credit card for deliveries (which is not allowed BTW)

I'll continue buying there, but cash only and in person from now on.  I hope the owners read this review so they can make improvements, I'd be more than happy to update my review then."}
