{"text":"Had there Chicken shish tawouk sandwich today for lunch. The place was busy but they were well managed and my order was taken a few minutes from when I arrived. The food did take about 10-15mins to prepare but was very fresh. The lady serving me was very nice and had a clean counter top where she was putting the vegetables from. I have ate their Manakesh and now tried this today. They always have awesome quality. I would recommend all to try this place out if in the area. You won't be disappointed. :)"}
{"text":"They're the best on their business
My son he don't like anything to take for his school snack, but their (lahem be ajeen). And for me I love everything they do."}
{"text":"My wife and ate at this restaurant several times.

The food is tasty and not pricey at all.
The restaurant is very clean
The service is good. Family owned and operated."}
{"text":"This place has THE best fatayer and manakeesh in town. I got a few dozen of a variety of fatayer for an event and the people who went simply loved them and wished I had gotten more! 
Spinach and Meat were my favorites! 
It's also a very clean establishment and food service is very fast!"}
{"text":"We arrived there abit early  , rice wasnt ready got the delux platter. and the beef was very dry . Was not all that warm either. Will not visit again"}
{"text":"I like this place in extreme winter weather, very cozy  small average place remind me with back home pastries. 

Their Hummas and Fresh made Foul are absolutely stunning. Serving with very hot pitta bread right from oven. Manakesh Zaater is my favourite there."}
{"text":"Disappointed by how far this place has fallen since I raved about it in September. I've been here a number of times since that review and have encountered:

1. Food poisoning - they reheated precut shawarma meat on the flat top grill before rolling it into a sandwich. Likely the source of my upset stomach. I still thought they could turn it around so I went again 
2. Overcooked manakish - dry as hell and overly crispy zaatar cheese manakish. Disappointing. 
3. Rude staff - some of the staff that work here aren't friendly. Placing an order means having to look at a draconian face because I've made the grave error of disturbing the staff from exchanging their really important gossip. 
4. Old garlic sauce - this for me was the nail on the coffin. I bought some garlic sauce in a tub yesterday. As soon as I took it out of the store, I can see it is starting to take on a greenish hue, a tell tale sign that this garlic sauce was probably made more than a week ago. I shrugged it off and I didn't want to create a fuss. I took it home and started eating it and it tasted really old, almost rancid. Super grainy as well. I had to throw it out. 

I will not be returning here anymore."}
{"text":"Best Zatar in Canada! Coming from Montreal where we have Andalos it means a lot!

It's a must if you love Arab food!"}
{"text":"I came here for a shawarma since it's close to my work. It comes with garlic sauce, and it was fucking PISSING garlic sauce. I wiped it off for the first few bites but when I opened it up I saw it was literally drenched, even causing the pita to be soggy. I came back asking for my fucking $8 back since the shawarma was inedible and was told they can only give me another shawarma. Why would I want another when this one is already making me sick. With so many other shawarma options, don't waste your fucking time and money on this garbage restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm surprised how flavourful the schwarma was. Very simple just garlic sauce, pickles and fries. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This place still makes the best Zatar (Mankaeesh) / Cheese pies in all of the GTA! Always fresh, always served with a smile. This remains our goto place for Zatar and Cheese, almost every other weekend!"}
{"text":"Best Manakeesh In the city! 
I love this place. My dad introduced me to this place a few years ago and I've been hooked ever since! The ingredients are so fresh and baked to perfection you can just taste it! 
They have a wide variety of dishes! The prices are great as well! Good place to come here for students!"}
{"text":"A very amazing Lebanese style bakery and they have tasty original Fatayer of all kinds.
The chicken with garlic & cheese is so amazing, am glad I found it."}
{"text":"Very doughy and yummy. They are fast, and take their customers seriously. I love everything there and their mini selections of pickles and olives. So good!"}
{"text":"Ordered zatar manakeesh, zatar veggie manakeesh and omelette manakeesh. I would recommend the veggie manakeesh. It was so good, make sure you eat it warm!! The omelette was bland and had no salt or pepper. I would stick to traditional versions of food when going to a ethnic restaurant. The girl at the counter was very nice, and it was a clean place. Not sure if they sell individual size labneh but I like to dip my bread in it. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I had their chicken shwarama plate delivered via uber eats.  The portions aren't the greatest, and the quality of the food wasn't the best.  It's like they didn't trim the fat off the meat.  I was a bit disappointed.  Never ordering again"}
{"text":"HALAL

Great shawarma joint in Mississauga, ON. Their chicken shawarma comes with fries, pickles, and garlic sauce...the perfect way a shawarma should be. Great taste! Great service. Prices are reasonable. 

It is definitely my go-to shawarma place."}
{"text":"Unfriendly staff. You feel unwelcome every time you visit. Food is good though. Still, I feel hesitant every time I go there because how customers are treated. The cash register isn't patient, rude and unfriendly. He needs to work on his attitude."}
