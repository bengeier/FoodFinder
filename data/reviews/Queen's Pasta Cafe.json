{"text":"Queen's Pasta Cafe has quickly become our \"cute little Italian\" place since moving to the neighbourhood. The pasta and seafood are killer! Excellent buratta and nice bottles. Attentive service, but they give you space. The lighting is very romantic, and the dishes are rustic and charming. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The bad reviews for this restaurant are completely undeserved.  We've been several times, and have had a great experience every time, even with our toddler.  Despite what you might read elsewhere, this place is child friendly.  The staff went out of their way to accommodate us and our son (keep in mind we have a head on our shoulders and take our child out to restaurants during non-rush hours).  The food is always delicious and reasonably priced - I'm actually not a pasta fan and this is one of the only places I actually order pasta.  This is our go-to restaurant in Bloor West for dinner.  Some restaurants in Bloor West deserve their bad reviews (like Sharkey's) - this place does not."}
{"text":"I had a birthday dinner here on Sept. 3rd and what a fantastic night it was! 

With an original guest list of around 20 people the staff recommended I talk to the chef and make a $30 price fixed menu. I felt super fancy and adult planning a menu with the chef. 

Unfortunately as the day got closer to, I had some last minute cancellations (aren't people the worst sometimes?) but the staff took it all in stride and recommended we do a large table in the main downstairs area rather than the private dining area upstairs as originally planned. I was fine with that.

The restaurant is very romantic at night all twinkly lights and soft music. I'd definitely come back here for a date!

The food was excellent. Being the birthday girl I tried a bite of every dish and everything was mind blowing. We had a spicy sausage and jalapeno pasta, a stuffed vegetarian ravioli, a chicken alfredo and a salmon with steamed vegetables on the price fixed menu. The main came with a salad and bruschetta and then 2 choices of cake for dessert. The drinks were excellent and left me happily birthday drunk. 

I had a wonderful birthday here and would do it again!

A weird payment thing to note about this place is they do not accept cash as payment, only debit or credit."}
{"text":"Been here three times and enjoyed my meal each time. Especially liked the simple but satisfying Spaghetti & Meatballs."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for dinner while passing down Bloor. The pasta was absolutely delicious most certainly due to its freshness. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We will make it a point to return for more."}
{"text":"Great pasta and such a beautiful spot to sit either inside or outside.  They didn't give me the right sauce but it didn't even matter it was delicious with the lemon garlic.  Will be going again."}
{"text":"I've eaten dinner at Queen's Pasta a number of times as there is not slot of choice in the area. Unfortunately, I've never been impressed with the food, which I consider to be fairly unimaginative, mediocre Italian.  The service is always good, but I just can't recommend the food."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and was so disappointed.  I've heard nothing but great things about this restaurant and was excited to try it.  I ordered the black and linguine and it was great.  Until I found a rubber band in my food.  When I told the waitress about it she took my plate to the kitchen and came back and said, \"we've conducted an investigation in the kitchen and haven't found anything.  It looks kind of suspicious\" in a very rude and condescending tone.  In the end, I did not eat my food and had to pay for it too.  I am very disappointed in the way this was handled."}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTING! 

This place had come highly recommended by so many people that I was really looking forward to the meal.  Any place that prides themselves on making their own pasta must be great, right?!  WRONG!  I ordered the the Penne with hot Italian sausage, peppers and onions.  The pasta was overcooked (way too soft) and literally tasteless.  In all fairness, my bf enjoyed his meal (can't remember what he ordered) which is why I'm giving it two stars instead of one. However he did agree that mine was just awful.

On the plus side, the atmosphere was cozy and charming and the service was really good.  Unfortunately, it just can't make up for such a horrible meal."}
{"text":"Always consistently good food and service! The short rib ravioli my all time favourite. Has become my go to pasta place!"}
{"text":"Being Italian I was expecting a lot more from an establishment catering to pasta as their main entrees.  It was fine to say the least, as the service made up for the spaghetti and meatballs I tried to enjoy.  The ambiance was also something to be desired, but we managed to get a seat on the patio with a table that managed to rock without very much effort.  Going back will definitely not be on the agenda, but they manage to secure a loyal following of locals that perhaps are not well versed in the way real Italian pasta dishes should be prepared, so I cannot crucify them for being diligent in that respect."}
{"text":"Surprise find I shall return to as often as possible.  Yummy food and attentive staff that truly cared about my dining experience.    Can't help but totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Don't quite understand the \"Queen\" connection, but the \"pasta\" part is a no-brainer: these guys serve nice pasta. The bistro feel of Queen's Pasta hasn't changed much over the years, but why mess with a good thing? 

Anyway, if you'd like to enjoy some of their tender fresh pasta at home, be advised that Queen's Pasta has a small shop just off the other side of Bloor where you can buy freshly made, uncooked pasta by weight to take out and make at home. Definitely beats the dried stuff."}
{"text":"With the kids on board we went to Queen's Pasta for dinner last night 10/03/2009. Walked in and we were seated right away and for a Saturday Night the place was not as busy as what we thought it would have been.

Upon being seated we were given water by 1 waiter & for a second there I thought that would be our waiter for the night but alas a 2nd waiter came on board to get our drink orders & we felt confident that this was definitely our waiter. Surprise a 3rd waiter came to take our food order ok do we really need that much attention to get 3 different waiters within a 25 minute time frame.

Enough of the waiters, we ordered 3 different pasta's & we were very satisfied including our 2 year old daughter (she never really eats a lot but she ate the Penne Carbonara).

My husband enjoyed the Linguine with chicken & he said it was the best that he ever had, and I just loved the Butternut Squash Agnoloti WOW! 

We are definitely going back to the Queen's pasta! Next time we hope we are just served by 1 or 2 waiters maximum. 3 waiters is absolutely unnecessary."}
{"text":"I thought this place is decent too, and it is a place that I will go back as well. 3 stars for good food but 4 stars for returning! I don't live in the area, so I've only been there twice in like 4 years. I remember I had the angel hair pasta the fist time and it was well done. The texture of the pasta was just right, not too soft, not too hard like uncooked. Second time I probably had the ravioli, it was delicious, but I felt the portion was a bit small. 

This place definitely worth a three star!"}
{"text":"This a great pasta place not far from my home but it is very expensive. It also gets very cold in the winter time the way the cold in blows in and the seating area is tiny. My favourite dish is the Sweet Potato Ravioli. Parking can be difficult on Bloor Street and you often have to wait a long time to sit."}
{"text":"I love love love this restaurant! I have been here a few times and I have never been disappointed once! I love their pastas and the portions are big, so I usually take some of it home to eat later. The waiters, in my opinion, were nice and friendly. I love their garlic bread. I have almost always been here during the day, in the patio. I think I have been there during the night time once, but I'm not to sure. I think as someone mentioned before, the menu isn't that big, and I am not sure if that is a good thing or not because the way I look at it is: is it better to have more options or not a lot? But I think that they have got more than enough, better to have a smaller menu where you can make the products well then to have a big menu and half the products are not well made. The atmosphere is really nice here, it is cozy and especially when it comes around summer time, it's nice weather and you're surrounded with people, it makes it such a great feeling and a great atmosphere. My only concern is that it can get a bit too dark inside during the night, so a bit (just a bit) more lights, especially during the night would be nice. I hope to be back very very soon."}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised that this place has gotten so many bad/just okay reviews because everytime i go in this place, its packed!  I went a couple of weeks ago, and in a nutshell, i would say that the food is of good quality, but it is a bit too expensive.

I went with a loud table of 7, and all of us enjoyed our food.  The specials that they have are very expensive, upwards of 30$ which i think is a bit crazy.  most of the entrees are about 15-20$.  i had the butternut squash ravioli.  it came tossed with roasted red and green peppers and some other vegetables.  when we asked the server, she told us more about how the pasta was made, as it had orange stripes on it.  it was a very pretty dish!  it wasn't amazing tasting but it was tasty.

the atmosphere is nice, it has a classy-laid back feel, with candles on the tables, but white paper table clothes, and crayons are provided so that you can draw as you wait.  i thought the service was good, especially upon dealing with a larger crowd.

i would go back to queen's pasta, but probably order something a bit more exciting, and not until i am prepared to spend quite a bit of money on a meal."}
{"text":"I live close by and try and review for others in the high park, bloor west region. 

This was my 2nd time dining at Queens. I think the best way to sum it up is very average. 

Bread was below expectation

Bruschetta was above average 

I always get a caesar salad to start at an Italian restaurant. Queen's was poor. 

Chicken Parm was good value, I was full after, nothing spectacular, but good. 

Cannelloni was above average 

Overall in the area I would suggest La Veranda over Queens and even Mama Martinos for the value"}
{"text":"Nice little place that delivers great pasta. Most experiences have been good with one exception, some way over cooked sea food. I can look past it. 

The regular menu items are far cheaper than the specials, and are often the better choice."}
{"text":"Great pasta joint.
Unfortunately I've moved further away from this area, but we still make random visits to Queen's now and then.
They do not have a big menu, however I almost always get an item off their ever-changing 'specials menu'... something different every time I go.
Cute, cozy atmosphere and a great location.
Prefer the upstairs when it is open."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for Valentines day.  The server had a bad attitude, we felt rushed, and we were not impressed with our meals.  We could have saved the $60 and made a delicious meal at home.  I've gone here before and had the canneloni (sp?) but it's the only thing that I find super tasty.  Food isn't worth the price in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came here with friends, great fresh food. The soup is all house made. The black and white pasta with shrimp is very good and my friend got the jumbo short rib ravioli special and it was amazing. Love it will come back"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable price, good service, nice wine list in the heart of Bloor West Village right near Village playhouse theater. Seating is a little cozy (read tight). I'd go back no problem!"}
{"text":"Had the cajun chicken pasta. Pasta was fresh, flavor was good, chicken could have been cooked more consistently to avoid the ends parts being hard. Otherwise service was good. Pluses on the patio and children getting crayons to color with.

Food is fine but lacking an excitement to have me running back soon."}
{"text":"Rule 1- Don't sit right next to the door...the \"airlock\" double-door system that places have adapted to keep the cold air out, just doesn't work.

Beyond that, if you are just looking for a really simple place to get pasta, this is it.  Nothing blew me away in presentation or taste.  I had the special of mushroom ravioli and duck with sun-dried tomato.  Everything was just put in a bowl and drowned in cream-sauce.

A bit expensive for what you get, but I'm assuming they've convinced people who don't venture too far out of Bloor West that it is the best of the best.  

They did, however, accommodate all the requests at my table to change types of pasta and sauces, so those who are picky can find a nice home here."}
{"text":"Excellent. 

The food is great, as is the wine list. 

The wait staff is prompt, professional, and friendly. 

A little busy at times, but aren't all good restaurants?"}
{"text":"I just moved to the neighbourhood and this place was one of the first ones that I added to my list. And now it has become one of my favourite ones after yesterday's lunch!!!

Apart from the service (which was super attentive all the time, without being annoying) and the menu (I liked the fact that they make daily cakes and pasta depending on the fresh ingredients they have), the pasta in general is WOW. If you like gnocci do not miss the sweet potato gnoccis with blue cheese and pecans, one of the best I tried. My boyfriend's penne carbonara were pretty amazing too.

It is sliiiiightly pricey but totally worth it, great experience."}
{"text":"Went there a couple of weeks back on a date.  Romantic, in that there are candles - always a necessity for me - and at least at the time, holiday?) lights in the window.   Service was fine: pleasant enough with no attitude, though I would say as expected i.e. largely unremarkable.   Unfortunately, so was the food.  I had the baked farfalle.  It lacked texture - largely melted cheese on soft pasta - or a sense of  freshness that one could achieve with spices (basil, oregano, hot pepper....) or even fresh tomatoes/vegetables fried/roasted and added.  I tasted my date's linguine carbonara, and similar reaction.  It's fine, passable food, but for a place specializing in pasta I'd expect much more.   

As an aside, I've never understood why Toronto lags in Italian food with such a large Italian population  One visit to New York city - memories still of fresh pasta with loads of garlic and sage  and olive oil, or pizza with roasted onions and red peppers and fresh mozerella - will have you asking the same."}
{"text":"Love this place! We came for a Friday night and it was packed! The food was delicious and reminiscent of authentic Italian family flavours. Portions were good and so was the service. The restaurant is a little small so the tables are pretty close to one another -- not that I minded since the food was good. There's also a patio for the hotter days and I would recommend the white sangria -- it's so good! They also have a weekday special menu that ways sounds interesting if you want to try something new. :)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite pasta places in Toronto. I don't usually re-visit restaurants in Toronto, because there is so many of them to try in Toronto. This one however I have been back 3 times now. It's got great portions, great selection and fairly priced. I will be going back again and would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food seemed like it was reheated and everything was just above par. I had the Rigatoni special. The taste was all there but the noodles were mushy and the sauce seems overcooked and old. Wished it was fresher."}
{"text":"The first time I ate at Queen's Pasta Cafe was after a lengthy apartment move, so pretty much anything was going to taste like 5 stars at that point. I've been back several times since, but it's never been quite so calorically magical as that first time was. One thing that never fails is the quality of the freshly made pasta. What often does fail is the execution. If you're a fan of North American style pasta preparations (i.e. extra-large portions with heavy sauces), then this is probably the best you'll have, but if you're hoping for more authentic, light and fresh flavors, you won't get that here.

I recommend the Penne Carbonara, which, counterintuitively enough, is probably the lightest, subtlest dish on the regular menu. The specials are usually good too, but they can be pricey (they usually include a seafood pasta and a lamb pasta).

The interior on the main floor as well as the nice summer patio make this a great place for a cheapish dinner date in the west-end."}
{"text":"A solid Italian restaurant that won't disappoint.  Portion sizes are reasonable and shareable between two.  

We tried the linguine with grilled chicken and it was excellent.  The sauce was buttery rich, creamy and had flavor and depth.  The pasta was cooked al dente which is how it should be.  

Service was attentive.  We arrived shortly before closing and were not rushed through our meal. Overall great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been here twice. First time got some kind of a pasta and thought it was ok, actually I could make something better at home. Second and last time I had a veal sandwich, which was cold and didn't look quite right, had only half and got sick... needless to say I won't we going back."}
{"text":"H'okay, so where does one begin after their first Yelping extravaganza?

Disclaimer: Had I arrived on the scene with a significant other or a friend perhaps, i'm sure the experience could have been slightly more suitable. However, solo lunches are sometimes necessary while on a dead line. Moving on.  

Queen's Pasta Cafe, (or QP Cafe, if you're a fan of acronyms like myself), is a lovely little... well, it's a lovely lil' cafe. Situated in the heart of the Bloor West Village strip between Jane and Runnymede station, QP is not too shabby a place at'all. 

Anywho, upon arrival, I strolled through the dining room to reach the patio. The space had a sensous elegance about it, and could accomodate up to 40 guests. I counted.

The patio itself was pretty cute, not gonna lie. It was a quiet lunch, so as soon as I was seated, my dear waiter arrived at my side. 

To start, I ordered a Caprese salad ($9.95). The boccocini cheese was moist, and topped with a dash of pesto. It was so good I ate the whole thing, using fresh slices of baquette to soak up the remaining olive oil and home made balsamic dressing. Sweet, rich, absolutely delicious. I could have drank the dressing with a straw. Om. Nom. Nom. 

As a main, I chose spaghetti in a fresh tomatoe sauce ($7.95). Yes, my starter was more expensive then my main. Weird? Yeah, I know. What chu' gon' do about it? 

The noodles were fresh, and al dente. Near perfect. I wondered if they were made that way by a tiny Italian Nonna who had been flown over straight from Italy. The tomatoe sauce had a bit of spice to it, but was light and creamy all at the same time. Minus the cream, evidently. As I flavour the sauce, I picture good ol' Nonna stomping on fresh tomatoes in a wooden tub, a bit of seasoning here, a bit of simmering there. And, voila! Whatever the case, it tasted pretty authentic. 

To wash this all down, waiter-boy helps me decide on a glass of Masi Volpolicella, from Italy ($9). It's light and compliments the flavours of my meal quite nicely. 

Other Deets:

QP has a lunch and dinner menu. Plus factor: there wasn't an over-whelming array of options to choose from. They also had a great selection of wines, cocktails, martini's and beer. 

If I were to return, I would return for dinner, rather then lunch. I would also bring a date, or a close-friend to keep me company.

Boo ya. Yelp virginity, taken."}
{"text":"I get the feeling there's no real understanding of Italian cooking here.  This is North Americanized Italian.  Food is decent though and they pile on the seafood."}
{"text":"In the years since I've last been here, nothing has changed: and that's a good thing! As before, the pasta is still cooked to perfection and I can still order my favourite dishes from long ago. The black and white fettuccini is one of the best dishes at this restaurant, followed closely by the angel hair pasta with smoked salmon. One thing that does change are the specials, and they're excellent, ranging from shrimp and lobster pasta to beef tenderloin. 

The ambiance is classy without being pompous or requiring an elaborate dress code. It's intimate, relaxing, and the restaurant sticks to what it does best: pasta. And that's about it. Delicious, perfect pasta. The service has stayed as friendly and laid back as it ever was, which is nice at the end of a busy day!

I still highly recommend this place and hope that they continue to serve the neighbourhood for a long time to come!"}
{"text":"I have been to this small restaurant a couple of times now and have enjoyed the food very much. The first time I went I had the short rib ravioli which was to die for! Ravioli stuffed with lots of meat, the ravioli pasta was cooked perfect all dente.  My boyfriend had the chicken  pasta in a cream sauce, again outstanding. Great balance of flavour and cream. 
The dessert was a chocolate cake - I think it was grand marnier cake. It was alright. 

The second time we went back, I had the special of the night, osso bucco( veal shank) in a marinara sauce and rissoto. The shank was cooked tender and I enjoyed digging out the marrow (best part) but I wasnt crazy for the sauce, the risotto was cooked simple but creamy ;  no big flavour because you use  the osso bucco sauce.  The other meal was a butternut squash ravioli which was good. 
The place is cute and quaint. 
Overall I like this place and would go back again.  This place gives a good serving of food too."}
{"text":"Cute mom & pop restaurant. Nice decor, simple yet relaxing. Service was mediocre. We ordered the calamari & shrimp with mixed greens to start. My husband ordered beef short rib ravioli and I had spaghetti bolognese. Ravioli was delicious. Bolognese tasted okay, wish pasta was al dante. Up until this point, I would have given more stars and would definitely come back. I asked for to go box and they came out with a box and a plastic bag. Not a big deal. Except for the fact we noticed all other patrons were given a brown to go bag. Left us wondering why we were the only ones with a white plastic bag? Could have been many different reasons in which they could have let us know (out of courtesy). Unfortunately, this left a bad taste in our mouths and we will not be going back."}
{"text":"I have had lunch and dinner at Queen's Pasta Cafe on a few occasions and have really enjoyed it. My favourite dish is the Penne a la Vodka. I especially like that they add green peas to it.
I've also enjoyed the bruschetta and Caesar salad as an appetizer and tiramisu for dessert 
On my most recent visit, I had the garlic bread with mozzarella and the Rigatoni Alla Rustica (for a change). We also had a white wine sangria which was so good and especially refreshing on a hot late summer day. The ambiance is quite nice. We've had the occasion to sit upstairs which is nice as it's not usually too loud. It can get loud in the lower level especially when they are busy. Service is usually good except for most recently when they forgot our drinks (but it was a festival weekend and they were slightly busy so I will give them a pass on that). Reservations are recommended. You would think they would not be too busy on a Tues night, for example, but we showed up around 6:30 and had to wait a few minutes at the bar for a table. It worked out as we ordered some drinks and waited it out."}
{"text":"i've been here a couple of times and my most recent visit was the best so far.  we had the burrata to start--f'ing delicious.  came with a kalamata tapenade and crushed chili peppers.  i had the grilled chicken linguini and my bf had a sausage and penne dish.  my pasta was amazing, perfectly cooked, piping hot, nice size portion.  my bf loved his sausage pasta but i thought mine was better.  bottle of pinot for $35!  service was good, never rushed, even as we neared closing time.  

appy, two mains, bottle of wine, tax and 20% all for $130.  hard to do in this day and age!"}
{"text":"Always been a great go-to place for good fresh-made pastas with creative sauces. HUGE flavours! Nice ambiance, decent wines. Fine for families too. And they do take-out just as well! :)"}
{"text":"This place is hopping!! -- It is definitely an older crowd up in here, but hey - they know where it is at. 

VERY good pasta. VERY VERY good pasta. And quite generous portions - i had to take the rest of my food to go, and believe me, I can eat. 

I'd like to go back."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Queen's Pasta in years, at LEAST 7 I would say.

It was always great food, busy place, but I was concerned when I checked out the reviews on Yelp when I decided to swing by there while I was in the b-dub with the wife.

Thought maybe it had gone downhill in quality over the years.

Answer? Nooope.

Food was fantastic. Service was super friendly and FAST. I can't believe how fast the food came and yet it was still that great.

To be fair we went at like 6:00pm on a Thursday night so a lot of people were just starting to file into the patio. We stayed inside because of construction down the street made for a noisy/dusty patio.

In the end though everything was top notch and exactly what I remembered from the place. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm shocked by the negative reviews. This place has been awesome since we started coming here around 10 years ago. The only negative is going here on a cold winter day. When people enter and the wind blows in, it is miserable. Otherwise, especially for me as a vegetarian, this place offers wonderful pasta dishes at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!  Their butternut/goat cheese ravioli smothered in grilled veggies is to die for!! The staff are great, its a very romantic, calm ambiance.. nice for dates or a glass of vino! Love the patio in the summer!   Great spot!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here and it was the first time I visited the restaurant. If you choose to sit outside, be prepared that some tables will be a tight squeeze so you'll be close to other patrons. I ordered the simple angel hair pasta with cream sauce and it was delicious. Specials are written on a big blackboard in the patio which is nice. Overall a pretty good atmosphere. Would definitely try it out again."}
{"text":"I know some people in my neighbourhood have a big boner for QP, but honestly? I'm not buying their high back chairs and white table clothes and over sized wine glasses. 

Ultimately, the food is really bad. 

First time I went my chicken was undercooked, which is to say, the middle was NOT cooked. The second time my pasta was over-cooked. The third? (yes I went again) it was REALLY over-cooked! 

I ask you this, how can a place with PASTA in its name OVER COOK its pasta?

If you're thinking about going, I suggest picking up the pasta yourself at Queen's Pasta Take-out on Beresford (right nearby) and cook it yourself."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Overcrowded, a bit arrogant in appearance for what it is.  My partner was in a bad mood after he ordered gnocchi with gorgonzola expecting a creamy cheesey sauce with some tomoatoes and 'shrooms as they stated.  Instead, he got tomato mushroom sauce with hardly a discernible trace of gorgonzola.  My pasta was passible but its sauce seemed to be a variant of his - sort of like dunking into a common kettle and making a few changes."}
{"text":"I was hoping this place would be better, given the name, but my smoked salmon in dill cream sauce over angel hair was just bad.  Soft noodles swimming in tasteless cream sauce with sticky lumps of obviously frozen, low quality smoked salmon.  For $17.99....fool me once, shame on...I'm not sure how that should end but it was just SO meh.  1 star for friendly server, 1 star for accommodating our stroller.  Oh, water was provided in plastic cup....?!  Minus one star for harming the environment."}
{"text":"Key Features: $13.00 pasta options

Don't be fooled by the website.  This is not an obnoxious, annoying, restaurant.  Why they chose to have a looping dance beat play as their flash-based introduction plays is beyond me.  This is what happens when you pay a first year design student to create your website, I guess?  And the second page that makes it look more like an Asian massage parlour (I mean, what's going on with that image of the girl, with the slashed shadows across her body?)

Now that we've agreed to not focus on the website, but rather on the restaurant itself, it's important to understand that there are a number of daily deals - well, specials, deals is a word that would conjure up thoughts of affordable prices.  For the most part, I've stayed away from anything not on the main menu.

And, even then, I'll look towards the 13.95 priced meals.  There are some cheaper, and some more expensive, but at the end of the day, my math skills tell me that 13.95*1.28 = 17.85.  Basically you're looking at $18.00 after tax and tip for a plate of pasta - and that's only if you limit your drinks to water.  

The food, however, is good.  And one bowl will have you filled (if you order noodle-type pasta.)

If you end up with the ravioli, or anything that isn't long and stringy, you'll walk away hungry.  And after paying $25.00 for the food alone, that's an unfortunate way to feel at the end of a meal.

While the restaurant, itself, may seem a little cramped - they have a secret upstairs, through the mysterious door at the back right.  What circumstances need to occur in order to find your way up there, I've never quite determined.  But the restaurant is a lot bigger than it seems at first glance.

If you like quality pasta, and have deep pockets - why not check it out.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I went there today because my husband wanted to eat pasta anyway. I asked for a Caesar salad with shrimps - you must pay an extra of 5.95 for shrimps on your salad, but I was ok with it. 

From the start: I've lived in So Paulo (HUGE Italian community) and I come myself from an Italian family. When I go to an italian restaurant, I expect good italian bread and excellent olive oil as an appetizer. Queen's offered me cold bread and only butter. This was a bad signal. 

When the food arrived, my 5.95 dollar shrimps turned out to be THREE SHRIMPS.  The waiter told me \"I'm sorry I have nothing to do with the prices, we pay an expensive rent, etc\". Bad excuse. 5.95 + taxes for THREE SHRIMPS? You must be kidding. 

The salad was a default Caesar Salad, nothing spectacular. 

My husband asked for a black-and-white pasta. His pasta was good, but I also think it was not worth the price - almost 20 dollars. It should be an AWESOME pasta, but it was more like something we could do ourselves. 

We decided not to tip after our experience at this restaurant.  Specially after the 3 shrimp thing. That's offensive. You can find shrimp dishes on Bloor for 10-12 dollars, FULL OF SHRIMP. 

I'm not coming back and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Great quality and very large portions for fair price.  
I usually go for the specials, so it is fully worth it.

Ambience:
Very cozy and romantic.  

Service:
Always friendly and attentive.  Keep refilling your water, but not annoying.  

Food:
For approximately $20 you can get a great meal.  A meal will fill you up for sur.e"}
{"text":"Atmosphere:

- The host welcomed me in from the tornado conditions outside and let me drip off on the wood floor, which was kinda nice. 
- We were seated upstairs, with a cozy feel and a nice view down Bloor West Village. 

Service:

- It took forever to get anyone's attention, but finally flagged a guy down.
- I recognized the \"unfit for service\" server-- the one who looks like an evil leprechaun, right? I embarked on a social experiment to kill him with kindness, and it worked!
- Sadly, our original server didn't know the specials (and read them only when prompted) and didn't tell me about the gluten free chocolate torte (which I saw on the chalkboard as we exited). I really wish he would have told me because I had already stated I was celiac, so that was not cool!!!!

- When every other Italian restaurant has \"10,000 Leagues under the Sea\" sized grilled calamari, how does Queen's Pasta end up serving the runts of squid?
- But my g-free butternut squash soup was delicious-- both sweet and savory, and piping hot. Just the thing to warm the soul that entered from the storm.

Overall, I think it had the best atmosphere of the BWV restaurants I passed on foot, and our table of 4 left satisfied with bellies full of pasta."}
{"text":"This restaurant is quite nice.  It's a small restaurant but they do take reservations.  We went there on Sunday afternoon and they were not busy at all.  They are known for their pasta and the dish I got was quite good.  They also have a decent dessert selection that was delicious.  Prices are typical Toronto pasta prices.  Some dishes does cost more than others pending on what you order.  Service was quick and efficient."}
{"text":"Very nice place, great service, good food.

Good spot for a date, or a casual dinner with the family.

I highly recommend the Butternut squash agnolotti, it's a plain but tasty dish at the same time.  I'm also a fan of the veal parmesan.

My only complaint is that they don't have pizza on the menu, when i go into an Italian restaurant, i always like to have that option."}
{"text":"Homemade pasta is done well. Had the seafood pasta and was delicious. Friend had the gnocchi which was good as well. Would definitely go back if in mood for good Italian."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy eating at this restaurant.  It's my favorite restaurant in Bloor West Village.  The service is usually luke warm but I always enjoy the food.  My husband's favorite is the black and white pasta, and we always enjoy the soup."}
{"text":"I've been going to Queen's Pasta for nearly 10 years now and the only times I've had terrible service have been with this one server who truly should not be working there (or in the service industry at all, for that matter). Unfortunately he still DOES work there, so I have just learned to avoid being served by him and request someone else if I see him.  

Now, onto the food: there are usually three daily specials and they come highly recommended. The first is normally some sort of vegetable-based ravioli, the second is a meat option and the third is usually an exotic seafood option like swordfish or prawns. There's also the soup of the day.

When I used to eat meat I never swayed from my precious \"Linguini with Grilled Chicken in Sun-dried Tomato Garlic Cream Sauce\". The dinner portion is hefty and yields more than enough for a leftovers split. Nowadays I tend to order the Cheese & Spinach Cannelloni - it comes with a creamy tomato sauce with melted mozzarella on top. The Butternut Squash Agnoloti (kind of like ravioli) are also excellent and a lot lighter as the sauce isn't cream-based. 

Queen's Pasta is a great dining experience if you're with friends and want to linger over a drawn out meal. There is also an upstairs that you can reserve for larger parties as well as an outdoor patio in the summer. I also love that you can purchase their fresh pasta and jarred sauce at the nearby Queen's Pasta Cafe Takeout boutique. 

If I had to make one suggestion it would be to upgrade the front entrance - waiting in that cramped space and being in everyone's way when you stand there is less than ideal."}
