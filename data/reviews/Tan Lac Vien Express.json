{"text":"The chicken pho was amazing. Loved the broth and good portions. A pho place in this area was much needed!"}
{"text":"I am ecstatic that my favorite Vietnamese restaurant opened an express restaurant walking distance from work in Oakland!! Everything is so good here but I usually get the BV1 Bun Special, love the shrimp and pork, or I get the Pho Bo with extra meatballs. Love, this place!! If you're going in to eat, Jess is an amazing server. Her recommendations are the best. 10 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Their Pho is amazing and the service was impeccable! The whole menu looks amazing. Location wise it's about a 10 min walk from Pitt so it very ideal for a lunch break retreat.  This site is cash only but they have an ATM indoors."}
{"text":"Definitely worth stopping at the ATM for... since it's a cash only restaurant. Ordered a pho with beef; was absolutely delicious. The owners are friendly and service was quick.  The only downside.... the smell from the bathroom could be dealt with... but once that bowl of pho is in front of your nose, you really don't notice anything else!!!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I got the fresh summer rolls with shrimp and vegan pho. Both were flavorful, fresh, and delicious. I also think it was a great value as the whole meal plus postmates delivery was only $22"}
{"text":"** Same restaurant as the one on Murray but it's express which means cash only and for take out (but can still sit down). Small family run business that has a homey feel but more on the pricey side.  Was craving pho and noticed this place so I decided to come here.. turns out it's cash only and mostly for take out so I had to go to CVS to get cash back (they do have an in store ATM though)  I ordered the Pho special ($13) which had a variety of meats like beef, flank, tendon, meatball, etc. The bean sprouts and sides came in a plastic bag on the side, and it was actually a generous portion.   I waited a good amount even though there was like no one in the restaurant and it's \"express\". The pho bowl was pretty big as well, but mostly noodles which felt a little off for some reason. Noodles tasted a bit starchy and not super chewy. I wish there was more meat... The pho wasn't bad but also wasn't anything special. The meat also didn't taste super fresh or quality, and for $13 I wish I got more meat. Most of the meat was the cheaper ones like meatball rather than the actual steak pieces. Wish I had a reliable pho place to go to in Pittsburgh :(."}
