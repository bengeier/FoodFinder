{"text":"I went there thinking it was a restaurant but it's moreso designed as a take out place with restaurant seating. I had the large chicken burrito and refried beans.  the chicken wasn't anything special and wasn't even filling and the refried beans was more like bean soup on a plate. It's way too over priced for what you're actually getting.  The food pics on their facebook page look NOTHING like the real deal and I was pretty upset that guacomole costs $6 for a 100mL container with no tortillas."}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this place - the host (maybe the owner?) is Mexican, so I had high hopes for the restaurant. We have lived in Mexico before, so we're always on the lookout for authentic (or close to authentic) restaurants in Toronto.  The food was okay but extremely pricey. We had chips and guac to start, but for the price, I would've expected a big platter of chips. Instead, we got about two handfuls, scattered on a large platter.  For entrées, I had the ground beef enchiladas with a tomatillo sauce. There were three decent-sized enchiladas, but they cost about $18. Someone else in my party had the chiles rellenos, which we were excited to try here. For about $15 (maybe more, I can't remember), there were two pathetically small poblano peppers, barely stuffed. It tasted fine, but wasn't anything I'd go back for when being charged that price. There wasn't really anything on the menu that was too authentic. I was hoping for some barbacoa or other cuts of meat - not ground beef and chicken breast.  The service was good. The waiter was trying his best.  There was live music when we went but it was so loud that we couldn't hear anyone at our table.   Overall, the place has potential, but the prices are too high and the whole business has lots of kinks to work out."}
{"text":"Best chimichanga I've had in years. Great service. You can order tequila bottles for the table. What more do you want. I will return."}
{"text":"Terrible food terrible service. I felt so bad for the owner that I ordered an appetizer and an entree it was terrible. No flavour whatsoever. Super quite. I feel badly"}
{"text":"Food is soo good and also healthy. Inexpensive and big portions. Chips and salad with every meal for no extra charge. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"The food wasn't all that good, tasting like canned food. The takeout was very slow and they ran out of beef before I could order."}
{"text":"Don't bother. My wife and I dropped in tonight for a meal and the place was busy. We were seated and ordered house specialty drinks which were quite good. It took a fair bit of time to order and we both ordered the specialty enchiladas, one fish, one shrimp and one short rib. You get a choice of 2 sides, I ordered Guacamole telling my wife we could split it and we were informed that wasnt included. The choices were rice, refried beans, house salad or sauteed veggies. My wife ordered the beans and salad. Over an hour later we asked the waiter on the status of our meals. Our waiter said he would bring them right out. My plate had the enchiladas topped with shredded cabbage and carrots with a side of refried beans and sauteed shredded cabbage and carrots? Didn't see that one coming.  My wife found that her fish, shrimp and short rib enchiladas were ground beef, ground beef and shredded chicken. She informed the waiter who said he would take care of it. (I offered to share while she was waiting but she said no). 10 mins later he told her that they would be right out, she told him to cancel as i was just about finished and we asked for the bill. The drinks were ok The food was so-so The service was not good"}
{"text":"First trip to Mexican Amigos. Late lunch. Pleasant reception at door. Excellent Sangria's. We ordered chicken tacos and chicken flutes (deep fried soft tacos). Both were excellent. Complimentary nachos and salsa. Friendly service. Will return again."}
{"text":"After reading all the other reviews my thoughts were quite different.  Perhaps they're improving on what they are lacking?  This place is definitely a good change from the AYCE Japanese found at every corner.    My fiancé and I spent Sunday lunch on the patio soaking in the nice day.  I thought the service was exceptional as the waiter was quick  to respond to the every table outside.  I do agree that the food took slightly longer to serve as it is Mexican food after all. Why would a salad take longer to make than 3 tacos? I was craving the guacamole but for $8 is quite steep. Even this dish took 10mins to make it to our table.  The food was delicious and filling.  Unlimited sour cream and chipotle added more flavor to my food.  My last thoughts, kitchen needs to step it up a notch and serve food slightly faster, or at least offer something to munch on while patrons are waiting.    I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"This place looks great inside and out.  This was the second time visiting Mexican Amigos. The first time we thought the food was horrible, but they had only just opened, so I gave it another shot last night with a work colleague.  Here's my run-down:  - the service from the wait staff is fantastic  - food arrived very quickly and was hot  - it was nowhere near as busy as last time, probably a telling sign they'll be closing down soon  - the food is still bad. I had the chicken burrito. There was too much rice, dry chicken, some kind of sweet/ sugary flavour inside, and very unimaginative sauces. The guacamole is very average, and the pico de gallo is not very good.  - the price is ok, but not for the quality of food.  I won't go back - they should learn a thing or two about Mexican food from the US chain Cafe Rio Mexican Grill. It's a real shame because they seem to be improving their service and wait times, but the food still sucks."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly however the staff wasn't this greatest, there were only a few customers yet it still took them time with our drinks. We asked for the frozen margarita but they just added tons of ice so it was basically on the rocks.  As for the food it was truly horrible I ordered vegetarian and my friend ordered a meat dish and we were both not impressed. I would not go back."}
{"text":"This place should be called Persian Amigos. Save yourself the time and money. You're better off going to Taco Bell"}
{"text":"Good food poor service!  The food at the is restaurant is good. The nachos and enchiladas always hit the spot! But I do have to admit that the service is way below standard. I think the servers must be the owner's kids, because they just don't care at all!  For example, we were placing our order and the  waiter's cell phone rang, and he picked it up in the middle of taking our order."}
{"text":"Refused to give take out. If I stayed for dine in it was not a problem but no staff to do take out..makes no sense at all. If you have staff to make me something if I stay then just have them make it so I can go too.  I don't mind waiting  but they said no.  So then close down  the place or serve equally. Not a fair service and if there is a place to make a formal complaint like a head office I will be making it.  I go here often and it's usually pleasant but this was not right."}
{"text":"This  review is mainly for the food , i tried chicken fajitas and enchiladas both of them tasted awful and frozen , I wouldn't try it ever again , over priced and low quality food . very disappointed !"}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout from Mexican Amigos several times since they've opened, usually tacos or burritos. I can't speak to the dine-in experience, but the takeout service has always been friendly and efficient.  The food is standard Mexican fare; burritos are perhaps slightly more authentic than the mission style burritos found at Burrito Boyz and the like. I've only ever had their ground beef tacos and burritos; beware: the last few bites will be wet with a combination of juice and grease from the meat. Excessive moisture aside, the beef was nicely seasoned, though not mindblowingly delicious. Worth the $6 for a small (which is still a decent size).  One thing standing in the way of Mexican Amigos' success seems to be the management. The woman who handles the takeout counter usually does a great job, but there was one day that I was there and she had a ton of orders coming in with no help from any other staff. It took over 20 minutes to get one burrito, and I contacted management to suggest training other staff to help out during busy times. I got a prompt response thanking me for my concern, and an offer of 50% off my next order.   The next time I went in, I was cornered by the manager, who wanted to know who had served me that day. He spoke over me as I tried to reiterate that I didn't think the fault was with the takeout staff, and just kept repeating that his standard is 3 - 5 minutes to prepare and serve a burrito (way too fast, in my opinion; I'd like all my fillings heated through properly). I came away from that conversation feeling like he took zero responsibility for the incident and was more concerned with blaming his staff. I ended up talking to the staff member in question separately to stress that I was not unhappy with her, but with the understaffing of the takeout area.  Based on the ratings from other Yelp users, I'd recommend sticking to takeout only; even on a busy day, the service seems to be better than in the restaurant."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! Dined with my sister and my child in an empty restaurant on a Saturday for lunch. Food was fair until our deep fried ice cream arrived hard as a rock. The waitress offered to bring us a new one \"free of charge\" stating that the kitchen failed to fry the ice cream properly. When our bill arrived, there was a charge of $7.99 for the ice cream. We questioned the waitress and she said that she meant that there wouldn't be a charge for the SECOND ice cream. We said that didn't make any sense as why would we pay for a second ice cream when the fault was with the kitchen and she had said the dessert was free to remedy the mistake. The manager then refused to remove the charge saying that we were not charged for the second ice cream and that they were doing us a favour. We told the manager that we now understand why the reviews are so bad regarding the service as it's terrible. He agreed! The cherry on the top was when we were leaving, the manager said \"goodbye\" and when we ignored him he had the nerve to call US \"so rude!\"  Needless to say, WE WILL NOT BE BACK."}
{"text":"I went back to try this place to eat with my boyfriend again after I no longer worked there (I left the place on my own) as a waitress when it first opened and the kinks needed to be worked out. From a previous employee and now customer experience the food and service is STILL HORRIBLE  which I had hoped after 6months things would be better. I can point out SO many things that do NOT make it authentic still. -they use black beans instead of pinto beans - they use basmati rice instead of normal rice -their side veggies are whatever they can get for a cheap price -their salsa is a joke and tastes gross I had such high hopes for this place when I first started but I don't know how long this place is gonna last. Working there was really bad: I didn't get paid for 7weeks and the business ran very unorganized last thing the owner yelled at me furiously in front of customers and embarrassed me. As a boss u don't do that."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with the chimichangas here! The service is great! They could improve on the side salads but really, if you're going here you're not looking for salad!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here a few days after they first opened.  I went to get a take out burrito and for some reason waited for nearly 20 minutes before being served despite there being only 3 or 4 people ahead of me in line.  Nothing looked overly fresh or appetizing but loving burritos I decided to try it anyways.  I asked if the refried beans were vegetarian (authentic mexican beans often have lard in them) and was told simply \"They're just beans.\"  That doesn't answer my question.  I wanted to know exactly whats in them.  Guaranteed there's some sort of seasoning or oil or something in them and it shouldn't be that hard to tell me whats in them.  When I further pursued, a man who was presumably the owner came out and gave me a bunch of attitude because he didn't know what was in them.  For the portion size, the food was overpriced and just as it looked, it was bland, dry, not fresh and not flavourful.  I'm more than certain that all of the \"testimonials\" on their website and the rave reviews on Urbanspoon are fakes submitted by the staff.  I also should note that there is nothing authentic mexican about this place.  The restaurant decor looked similar to a Wild Wings.  Nothing special.  Overall I was highly unimpressed by this place.  I may give it one more chance considering that they were brand new when I was there.  Hopefully they have improved."}
{"text":"The food is authentic and so very yummy ! The service is exceptional and I love the ambience ..."}
{"text":"First, there are few Mexican restaurants in Toronto that are authentic, and this is not one of them.  The whole business flow is off.  Is it a fast food joint, or a restaurant, or a nightclub? I felt cheated when I made an order to go and got the fast food joint, and people who sat to eat got the restaurant quality food cooked in the actual kitchen.  It felt like my food was assembled; instead of prepared.  I will not go back.  The employee who took my order at the cash register was ditzy, and unable to explain their products properly.  It's all wrong.  The restaurant/ fast food dive should be rethought.  It felt like a badly run Mucho Burrito.  As I said to the staff, good luck. They believe they can get away with just providing the minimum, because they're the only ones in York Mills.  You still have to deliver quality on all levels."}
{"text":"Food: 1 star Service: 3 stars We will not return, nothing special and tasty to keep us going back. It's so sad that there is no good mexican good in this area."}
{"text":"This is NOT authentic Mexican food, as someone who lived in Mexico this is an insult to their cuisine. If I could give no stars I would"}
{"text":"If I could rate this in the minus I would. ZERO flavor. When the waiter asked how everything was I told him I could do better at home with my eyes closed and hung over........my Daughter had the fish tacos......NO FLAVOR......isn't it supposed to be flavorful?  WOW........!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Waited close to 2 hours for the food to arrive. My order was wrong ( I ordered 1 less ingredient) and was told my the manager this is the way it comes. And that I should leave and pay or else they are calling the cops. It's a family restaurant and the manager is the one who spoke like this to my group. Very very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Not authentic - can an authentic place have ground beef tacos using tiny supermarket taco shells with bottled salsa, chopped lettuce and cheddar cheese?  - this is same level as Taco Bell. You want authentic Mexican try playa cabana or El Sol on Danforth."}
{"text":"Horrible costumer service....!!!!group of 6 people Standing at the door  for more than 5 minutes ,all servers ignored us...then after calling them finally we sat down,ordered food,there was a piece of bone in my ground meat taco !!!...lucky didn't break my tooth!!!,never go back... :( can find tastier taco at taco bell... :-)"}
{"text":"Service and food is getting worse and worse. Messed up my takeout order, when i came the next day to order again i told one of the workers that they messed up my order the night before she simply told me she'll let the kitchen know and turned around and walked away... disgusting."}
{"text":"This place made me and my bf sick. We both wanted to throw up before we even finished the food. Just terrible! I spent my entire night after dinner in the washroom. Waitstaff was friendly, but who cares! The food made both of us sick!"}
{"text":"The food is pricy for the area and for the meal you get. You don't get a full meal with some of your orders. The food lacks flavour. The location is convenient."}
{"text":"Very bad experience here. Don't come here. The owner is rude and have no respect for customers."}
{"text":"On family day my family (13) of us went to this dirty and over crowded resturant. We had to ask the server to take our order and it took her 30 minutes to come back for the order. When the food finally arrived the server spilt food on my son not once but twice. She spilt the salad dressing on his coat which is now ruined. Instead of calling someone to help her she just walked off. The tables were so close together she could not move between the tables. To top it off when I asked to speak to the owner I took him aside and told him what happened. He just stood and looked at me with a blank look as I wanted to make sure he understood me I spoke to him in his native language. He was the rudest person that I ever met. He told me that if I did not like his resturant that I should not come back! This person should not be in business!  I would never go back to this restaurant. Also hope no one has to use the washrooms as they are very dirty ."}
{"text":"No stars!! I don't know why my review keeps getting filtered, but I am going to re-post as many time as possible! This place sucks! I was excited to go to this place since I noticed it recently opened. I kept telling my friends; 'let's try it out'. I ended up going with my wife. What a mistake! When we pulled into the parking, we noticed it was busy. Which is usually a good sign for a restaurant. Not so here. We went in and lined up. There was about 3 groups ahead of us. They got seated and we were next to be seated. The manager/owner, asked how many? Only the 2 of us. There was another couple behind us and 2 groups of 4(parents+2 kids). The manager/owner asked the couple behind us, how many, and the group behind them, how many? They took the 1st group with 4 people and seated them ahead of my wife and I and the other couple behind us. I thought, that's weird, we were here before them. Ok, no problem, we'll get the next table. The manager/owner then did the same thing with the other group of 4. At this point, I asked what was going on, as we were here before either of the other groups. The manager/owner explained that he was seating groups of 4 at tables for 4+people. I said that was not fair, as we had been waiting. He said that it does not make sense to sit 2 people at a table that can seat 4. I said that was an unfair policy and it should be first come first serve unless they had reservations. He just kind of shrugged his shoulders and ask us to be patient. Needless to say, I was pissed at this point. That should have been my clue to get the hell out there, but being a new restaurant with Mexican food, I wanted to try it. We eventually got seated. We sat there, with servers running around and not one came over to our table to take our drink order. I had to ask one of them for some menus and drinks. After that the waitress that served us was friendly and attentive. We noticed that another couple that sat close to our table had to wait quite awhile before they were even noticed!  We order a Bloody Ceasar, Corona, an appetizer; corn chips and pico de gallo. A chicken chimichanga and a steak chimichanga. The corn chips were stale. Not much of an appetizer. The Bloody Ceasar had hardly any ice cubes. I had to to go to the bar and ask them to put in a few more. When they brought us the chimichanga, my wife and I looked at each other. That's all there was on the plate! And something runny that we assumed was re-fried beans. No sides! Like rice or a salad.I wanted to complain again, but my wife convinced me to try it. She is not one to complain. At least not to anyone, but me. I had the steak chimichanga. At least I think it was steak. More like pieces of rubber mixed in some awful paste with no taste! At least they had habanero sauce on the table to add some flavour! I ate just over half. Which was not much of a feat as there wan hardly anything there to begin with. My wife ate about half of hers. She said she did not like it all.  All together the bill came close to $70. What a rip off! I left feeling ripped off and still hungry. If you want bad host/hostess service mixed with bad expensive food, this is the place! This was the worst dining experience I have had in a very long time!"}

{"text":"I tried this restaurant several years ago when it first opened.  My wife and I and our kids were underwhelmed.  Realize it often takes time to get things right so we tried Mexican Amigos again several months ago. Unfortunately the experience wasn't much better.  Service was good. Staff were friendly. Decor and ambiance is very good. Unfortunately the food was not very good.  My family loves mexican food and we eat at a lot of different restaurants and really wanted to like this one as it's so close to home.   It was few months back but don't remember everything we ate. My son had fish tacos which he absolutely hated.  I had a burrito  but found the chicken not very tasty.  Texture was weird as well.  My daughter had the enchilada which she thought was fine.  Don't recall what my wife had but she also wasn't that enamored with it either.  We prefer Lone Star's food by a huge margin."}
{"text":"Was ignored by all the servers (3 of them) on the patio tonight. I sat there for 20 minutes until I finally left. Apparently their heads either do not turn to see who might need what OR I had my special invisible person hoodie on & didn't realize it."}

{"text":"Entre prices have gone way up and quality has degraded. Another example of greedy owners ? Used to go there all the time but last couple of times , disappointed !"}
{"text":"We went 2 times  1st time there was only me & my partner, SLOW service somewhat rude, we wait 13 min to order drinks then another 15 for her to come back for food. She kept leaving to talk with staff , we had to get up walk to the bar and ask another server if they saw her to please let her know we need more drinks and later on the bill . Food wasn't that great tasted bland.  2nd time my aunt chose to have her party here of 9ppl. Service was faster but still slow! Food took extremely long! There was only 4 ppl at bar and 3 tables occupied so it was pretty dead at 7pm on a weekday. Don't know why we waited 45min for food!!!!! Server was nicer but she forgot to get refills a lot. The seating and tables ratio IS off.  Food did have large portions but it tasted okay nothing great like real traditional mexican food should be , price has gone up. It's not that great of a time I feel its more better for bar than dinning.  Im not going back again no matter what, save your money & time. GO ANYWHERE ELSE!"}
{"text":"A friend of a friend flagged this new-ish Richmond Hill spot for me recently, letting me know that a real quality place was getting (in his words) slammed on yelp. He said, hey go check it out and give it an honest review.... ok ok ok. Mexican Food close to home, twist my arm LOL  From a decore stand point this place looks great. Great layout,  Bright vibrant,  Clean. I'll agree with a previous review that the booths have something funky going on with the table height to seat height ratio. I'm comfortable 6'1 and I felt like a little person sitting in these booths.  The ambiance was set by traditional Latin music played at appropriate dining level (not too loud)  One thing I though was interesting was the set up here, it has a take out/subway/mr.pita style set up with the sneeze guards and fresh veggies as soon as you walk in, and you MUST walk through it to sit down and dine. This could be confusing for people thinking that this is strictly a sit down place....rest assured they have that too, just make it to the hostess station.  Once seated I found the staff to be very friendly and attentive, checking with me regularly on my order. Best of all they made very strong/specific recommendations for the best of the best of the menu.   An Item of specific note is that they must be reading their reviews because following my order I was brought chips and salsa verde free of charge. Previous reviews complained that this came at a charge. Chips were kinda stale-ish but the salsa verde was limey and a great pre meal snack. I was hungry...I would have eaten the table if there hadn't have been any chips.  Following my servers recommendation I ordererd the burrito carnitas (pork) and opted for black over brown beans. Here is my honest evaluation of what I was served.  Pros: - decent size - included pico de gailo - included guacamole on top with order (no extra charge :)) - price pretty good @$12 - cheese melted on top (interesting new way of trying) - The extra hot habanero sauce was tasty and full of fire - it really made me sweat! - The provide your own bottles of sour cream and chipotle sauce to the table to add at you own discretion. I liked this as Sour cream has a tendency to cause me pain.  Cons: - some of the pork was a little dry but others were cooked well. Although I felt it was a tad light on the meat - lots of rice.... I have a feeling it might have been sitting as it was a little dry - That side of hot sauce I ordered came at a price tag of $2 - Which my server FAILED to inform me of  Overall it would appear that they're improving from where they've been. I still think that paying $6 for a single Corona is ludicrous anywhere north of Finch - that would be something to look at (you guys are NOT Toronto...don't charge Toronto prices).  Perhaps they're heading in a good direction. I'll check back in a couple months again.  I give this spot and HONEST 2.5 stars, but because I'm in a nice mood (and we dont do 1/2 stars) I'll round up to 3....for now. But I've got my eyes on you Amigo....I've got my eye on you!  PS - one last thing...TAKE DOWN YOUR BLASTED \"GRAND OPENING\" SIGN!!! Youve been open for months now....its not working!!! Jeeezzz"}
{"text":"I have heard some good things and some (really) bad things about the food at Mexican Amigos. I went mid afternoon on a weekend, just after lunch time, where there wasn't much of a crowd. Ordered take out and the service from the bar was great, friendly, and smiling. I ordered the Chicken Burrito from their express menu, and overall my opinion of the burrito was that it was average. The toppings very standard, the sauces were okay, nothing memorable or enticing to the taste buds. Overall, in my opinion, For my first impression of Mexican Amigos is more of a bar then a restaurant. I haven't decided if i would go back..."}
{"text":"The food has been good every time I go, but you need to be warned that it is pricey for what you get. Like other people are saying, go to a competitor and you get nacho chips with salsa, here you get nothing and you pay a little more. I will say that the food is superior, however the portions are al little lacking for the price. Takeout to problems.  They need to lower their price or up their game."}
{"text":"First impression: I thought the waitresses' attire was more appropriate for hooters than family dining. Sunday dinner 7pm and though it wasn't busy we had to wait to be seated.  Food - I had the tacos. 3 vegetable tacos plus house salad, and two sides. I chose rice and beans. Tiny house salad! Never had green beans and cabbage in a taco before, but it wasn't bad. $12 - My boyfriend had the chicken and chorizo mix chimichunga. His house salad was also a size for ants. He said it was good, very filling, but they didn't do a good job on the deep frying as it wasn't crispy. $15  Service - not enough staff: the restaurant was not busy but it took a while to be seated and served.  - manager: brought us extra napkins and water but took it away when it realized we didn't ask for it. Also didn't even say thank you back after we paid.   If I came back I would order their vegetable chimichunga."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm biased because I'm from Texas, but the food was not good. Very bland but also odd tasting. The lime margarita was very sweet and very acidic. I had the braised short rib chimichanga and was incredibly disappointed. The only way I can describe the food is tasteless, no flavor, boring."}
{"text":"Great food decent service in a cool 'cantina' atmosphere- very spacious!   They have everything from your basic nachos, 7 layer dip,  tacos, burritos to more different things like chimichanga and etc. they have seafood options as well.   Be warned the spicy salsa is actually very spicy. It's habenero based so opt that on the side if you like some heat but do not order your dish doused in it..  They also have a selection of alcoholic and nonalcoholic fruity drinks.  Would come here again, great for groups!"}
{"text":"I don't ever write reviews but I was just so upset coming out of this restaurant that I had to. If I could give this place negative stars I would.. the service (from the waitresses to the kitchen) was slow and the food was definitely OVERPRICED! I got 3 mediocre tacos for $13 and my boyfriend got under seasoned enchiladas for $14.. the sides that came with it didn't help either. The only thing i'll give the kitchen and worth what it cost was their calamari but I was still very upset paying for the food because it just was NOT worth it. I received a bill worth about $50 for food that I could've got for cheaper and even tastier at chipotle."}
{"text":"i came here once for UEFA finals and the food was good but not worth 20 dollars in my opinion. not saying its bad but for 20$ you can find better food"}

{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Mexican Amigos on a whim for a late lunch. We were excited to try it as there are no other Mexican restaurants in the York Mills area. We were greeted nicely and brought to our seats. The server was knowledgeable about all the items on the menu and answered all of our questions. We were brought complimentary nachos and chips and he brought our drinks promptly as we needed more time with the menu. My boyfriend ordered the Chorizo Chimichanga with salad and I ordered the Crispy Fish Tacos with salad and rice. I would say it took about 10-15 minutes for the food to arrive and it was perfect timing as we had just finished the chips. The Chimichanga was huge, there and I received 3 tacos. We are lovers of mexican food and have eaten at many different restaurants in North America. The food was DELICIOUS! Full of flavor and spices and was also brought 2 hot sauces and a squeeze bottle of sour cream. We also were brought refills of our drinks plus waters on the side. We ate everything on our plates and were so happy with our food. The server was very professional and helpful. We have ZERO complaints about the restaurant, food or service. Everything was top notch and the interior was really pretty. We cannot wait to visit again for Margaritas and Nachos! EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"It was good, People say that the price is high. I don't think so. Considering that they are well staffed, quality items and pretty cheap booze (5 coronitas for $13).  I'm pretty sure the plaza they are located in is prime retail and it has heavy competition around the same vicinity (dragon pearl, thai one, fox and the fiddle, wendy's and me va me...etc) . So with the competition and high lease of such an commercial place; it is very fairly priced.  It definitely is not a  fast food dive in like burritoboyz or other Mexican places. This is a proper restaurant with the right ambience that gives you that feeling of a vacation.  The enchilada I ordered was delicious but they toned it down on the spiciness. The free Nacho's was a good gesture, however the dip was pretty awful until you mix it with the complimentary sour cream and chipotle sauce (then it becomes very yummy).   I asked for 4 chilli's but wasn't really affected that much. I also tried a bit of the chimichanga, I definitely have had better, but the person who was with me is a novice to Mexican food and loved it and is dying to come back and introduce it to others.    i liked it, and if the place runs long enough. I would step in again."}
{"text":"This place won't last a year, lone star has way better food and service. I ordered a chicken burrito, it was terrible for what I paid, and $2 for a simple bottle of water. The chicken must have been sitting for a while, I've had ten times better mexican food downtown, years ago, now all these uptown places for some reason can't get it right,  I'd rather just have a chicken souvlaki or shawarma with much better quality, there's an abundance of places in the area."}
{"text":"Not even a one star- this place serves nothing unique or nothing good.  Bad flavour, not fresh, nothing exciting.  Never come here again.  Service was ok I guess. But it didn't make up for the food."}
{"text":"Great place to eat!  Best dishes are the burrito, taco salad and the stuffed peppers!  Been eating here for almost 2 years now, and still as good as always!"}
{"text":"Great Beer selection an options, extensive tequila list and excellent variety of Mexican dishes cooked fresh. Nice to see a Mexican place in this area, thought it was just burritos but was happy to see it was a full sit down restaurant, we were there on Saturday night and they also had live music all night! Would go back again, perfect for sharing with friends, the TVS were also a plus for live sports."}
{"text":"Have the taco salad oh my stars fantastic, wash it down with 2 beef tacos the food here is superb I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is really just bar food.  I'm sure if I came on a UFC night, I would be happy to watch the small screens they have to be able to order Mexican food.  But when I'm on a journey for Mexican food I expect more.  Not a lot more when it's outside of Mexico and even less when outside of Toronto, but I expect more none the less.  The Azteca soup actually tasted good, but the presentation was bad, and I mean fingerprints everywhere bad.  Chips are not fresh or complimentary.  Had to ask for hot sauce, thought I would get a few selections of home made, instead got a jar.  Gave us sour cream in a bottle, not sure what for.  Pretty sure it was the powdered stuff mixed with water.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Solid food, decent service, big portions, food was VERY fast- almost too fast (chips, meals came out within 5 mins of ordering). A bit pricey, but okay overall for Mexican chain food."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give this place a one star is cause at least we didn't get sick from eating here so the food is edible I guess.  Moving on I will 'pile on' and reiterate there is nothing 'Authentic' (well as authentic as an Iranian guy running/cooking at a Mexican joint could get) or 'Fresh' about this place.   Based on my Taco plate and my finance's Burrito, I can feel they use a lot of canned sauces and frozen material.  Someone should tell them people are not stupid and can tell when their food is microwaved!  To add insult to injury, service is barely adequate. Indifferent servers without a smile and slow service on an early evening with only a few tables occupied.  Conclusion: TV-dinner like quality and poor service = the many negative (and one obvious shill) reviews and lost business from folks who would never go back.  It's funny the owner brags about his years of experience in 'hospitality' on his profile here but from the way this place is run it's pretty obvious he has a lot to learn.   Good luck to this joint but no way I'm spending a dime here again."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner.  I was extremely not impressed.  Service was encreadably slow.  The place was des d and we could see staff wandering around.  Our drinks took over 10 min to arrive.  We ordered chips and salsa. That took over a half hour.  The chips were lame and not very good and the salsa and guacamole wasn't home made or special in any way.  After waiting over 45 min for a burrito and some tacos some manager came to ask if we were happy and we told him we w ernt and he saodn was going to fix it and took off.  No one even came back after complaining.  Im still still at the table waiting for food."}
{"text":"For the past few months I've been eye balling this restaurant everytime I pass by. Finally went in today. Wow. I ordered the amigos platter with sauteed veggies and salad. The portions on the platter were perfect and extremely tasty. It was delicious and very satisfying. The staff were attentive and nice. I highly recommend this place and will be going back. I normally go to sneaky Dee's down at Bathurst and college and comparing the two, I actually prefer mexican amigos."}
{"text":"I've tried many Mexican style restaurants throughout Toronto, and this place is underwhelming to say the least.   I went here with two friends and we were prompty greeted and given menus. We ordered a pitcher of beer and things started going downhill. The waitress must have forgotten about us because it took over 15 minutes for her to come back with the beer and take our orders.   I had enchiladas, and my friends had chilaquilles and chicken fajitas, respectively. Now, I'm not 100% sure how they felt the next day, but I took 5 dumps before noon. The food itself was bland and tasted microwaved.   I would not recommend coming here unless you're on some type of detox diet that calls for anal cleansing."}
{"text":"Tacky faux-mexican restaurant. Mediocre food. Mediocre prices. Why.  Don't do it."}
{"text":"Came here once for tacos, tacos were soggy and tasteless. All the food is bland, the bar is okay though. if you want to drink and eat nachos go here, if you're looking to dine, don't even bother."}
{"text":"I have to admit that this place has improved...  My husband enjoyed the burrito (take-out) more than the last time.  If the food was as good as Chipotle, I would be there a couple times a week.  I'm not sure that I like guacamole that is so \"fluffy\"...  Chips are good."}
{"text":"My first impression of this place was how nice and clean the restaurant looked, I though this is the nicest Mexican restaurant I have been to. However, the food is not authentic! It is a cheap knock-off.   They do not have any of the traditional Mexican dishes or drinks, I felt like if I were at a Taco Bell. I am very disappointed with the overall menu and sections even though they all may appear to look and sound like Mexican dishes they are not! This type of menu is a TexMex which is a fusion of Mexican and American cuisines. There is nothing wrong with that, it's just that this restaurant claims to be Mexican. Overall the food was not bad it was well done and season correctly, it just was not authentic Mexican Food!  I was told at the end of my meal that there are more authentic dishes that this place does serve just not that day that I was there, which brings up the question why then do they claim to be a Mexican Restaurant??"}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch. For a chain I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of ingredients and presentation. My Shrimp Empanada was filled with large whole shrimp. It was neither greasy (for something deep fried), salty or overloaded with cheese. Overall food seems to be very good. Establishment was clean, service excellent."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We waited and waited for our order in  a near  empty,, well staffed restaurant. We were given so-so chips with a  disgusting  sweet salsa with had nothing Mexican about it.  After more than 30 minutes of waiting for our order,  of chips with cheese  and chorizo, we  got up to leave. We  were \"begged\"  to have  a conversation  with the owner, who asked to stay for 2 minutes while he ensured our  order was to his standards. He said he would go to  the kitchen  and make  sure.  Five minutes later a plate of chips with traces of melted cheese, and about 1.5 ozs. of ground chorizo came to the  table. It  tasted  like cardboard, and was very skimpy for $19.00.  The owner returned and we  shared our  feedback of the  taste. I suggested he go to Montana's and compared his offering  to  their offering.  He agreed  that the dish was up to his standards. I reminded him that he had  personally checked the item. He then complained about his  rent  of 22K  a  month.  I  pointed out to him that his pricing was on the high side.   We decided not to eat the dish on the table and left $5.00 for the  wait staff. I have never been confronted  by  an owner  full of such  B.S. It is one thing to explain, but please don't be condescending.  By the way he  also  said his Yonge Street location is delicious.  This is a restaurant that deserves to fail!"}
{"text":"As frequent visitor of Mexican restaurants, I consider my self ver knowledgeable with the Mexican cuisine.  Mexican Amigos lacks the true nature of an authentic Mexican restaurant.  To be authentic, the complimentary chips and house salsa should be coming to the table.  There was never a mention of chips or salsa at Three Amigos.  Secondly, having a good house Margarita is essential.  Mexican Amigos again lacks in the Margarita department.  The drinks were small, watered down with shelf bought Margarita mix and lacked the presentation that any typical authentic Mexican restaurant would deliver.  This leaves us with the food.  Mediocre at best.  The portions are small and expensive.  For example, Fajitas, Enchiladas, a kids Taco and 2 drinks ran $90.  The exact same meal in Florida, California or Texas would be about $18. Overall, I give them credit for trying up here in Canada but unfortunately I will not be going back.   There are other options for Mexican which are better than Mexican Amigos.   Go 5km south to La Mexicana on Clarke or drive to St. Clair for El Rincon.  Same price but you get more authentic flavor as to what you might get in Playa Del Carmen or Cancun. 2 out of 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Food is amazing   Portions on cheese and rice are very weak  Great atmospheric presentation   Prices passable    Staff in rear of building always smoking  Reeking of cigarettes"}
{"text":"Order the Amigos platter! It literally comes with a bit of everything!  If you like variety, this is your best bet! It comes with a small chicken quesadilla, a beef burrito, a hard taco, and two sides! Soo much food it's almost impossible to finish in one meal but totally worth the price of $20.   Been there twice now and quality of food is always good.   Definitely worth a shot!"}
{"text":"This place is unbelievably good. I was there on Saturday and there was a line up. Here the video I found online about them. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2ZFwQDboYY&feature=share&list=UUmDGvSNs5a2-88zcKTV-jfg I have no idea where Dudley was. The prices are really good. $90 is impossible unless he's buying a lot of booze? Anyways I love this place. Food & staff are great."}
{"text":"I see people complaining about service but giving thumbs up for food. I thought their service was awesome and the only reason I gave them 3 stars. Food was so so. I had their combo plate which came with a taco (good), burrito(I think there may have been beef in there somewhere), chicken quesadilla, and a chicken enchilada.   The taco was good the rest .....not so much. Also the fact I had to order chips and salsa,  is insane. Maybe that is how it is in Canada?? In the US you are greeted with chips and salsa as soon as you sit down.   I may come back while I'm here this week as I'm thinking fajitas or tacos would be the way to go.   So for me, food not impressive but I may come back to try something else because the service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Not the most authentic place, even the menu was badly translated (I'm bilingual in English and Spanish, but my Spanish speaking friends actually got all confused with the menu). The food wasn't bad, but I've had more memorable meals, and as some people have stated here: it's not very authentic. Service wasn't that great - it's understandable if the waitress doesn't speak Spanish, but at least don't give my friends a dirty look if they don't understand an item in the menu, especially when it's because the menu is not translated properly (pretty much, they mixed up the Spanish words for \"appetizers\" and \"entrées\" - just write it in English if you're not sure about the proper Spanish terms!).   Overall, it wasn't that bad, but wouldn't go back. There are definitely more authentic and friendlier Mexican restaurants in this city!"}
{"text":"Better off going to a mamma pappa Mexican restaurant. The fajitas were ok but it didn't come with sour cream which is a must for me. It did come with guacamole which you would usually have to pay for at other places. There wasn't much seasoning on the steak and veggies. My husband dish was satisfactory, I don't remember what he even ordered so that says a lot. Service seemed disorganized, it was a full house and they just recently opened so I''ll give them a break because of that. Wouldn't go back for dine-in but maybe for their take out area for a quick burrito or taco fix since its the closest Mexican place around the area."}
{"text":"Greeted by a friendly hostess that made me and cousin feel like we had just entered Mexico which was nice since it was a  freezing  day in Toronto. As we were seated we noticed there was live mariachi duo playing table to table. The atmosphere was great! Drink order was taken pretty fast. We shared a bulldog(margarita with a corna in it) which both found it delicious and enough to share. We were served by two waiters which took quite awhile to take our orders. Our food took about hAlf hour. Tables near us who had come after us were served before us which was a little unsettling. We ordered chilli renanos and fish tacos . The chilli was a bit to spicy and everything else lacked a little flavor. Over all we had a fun time because of the atmosphere but wish the food tasted more authentic."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here all the time. We always get a vegetarian nacho, and I'll get a steak burrito which has shredded meat. It's cooked and marinated to perfection. They have the best habanero sauce that u can request to be put into the burrito and every bite is heavenly. My wife will get the chicken burrito She loves it! The sour cream is addictive and the staff is comforting and you won't wanna leave... Also because the portions are huuuggggeeee."}
{"text":"I've never had traditional Mexican food before, but I thought it was pretty tasty!  Went there for a lunch buffet so that I can try a bit of everything.  It's a brand new experience for me and it was a nice one.  The waiter was really good....super attentive and on top of things.  My fav was the chocolate mole veal.  Since it was a buffet, it was all you can scoop guac - yum!  The dessert at the buffet wasn't Mexican (ice cream, chocolate mouse and custard flan), but it's nice to end on a sweet note.  I almost forgot to mention.  The sangria was refreshing too!"}
{"text":"I like the ambiance. I like the location (close to me). Oh, and the food is tasty! I am not going to complain about the price. If we were in Mexico maybe I wouldn't pay this much...but no where in the GTA will give you this quality and huge portions for that price. I've totally been back for takeout and dine in, and I love it."}
{"text":"The food was great, we really enjoyed our meals. This is a simple happy place for a meal. It's an interesting place, it's part Mexican restaurant with live Spanish music and part sports bar with 5 huge widescreen TVs over the long bar and many more around the wall and even single screens in some of the booths.  The menu is single sided, simple and short. The staff are moderately capable, but for sure polite and trying to please. The place is tidy. The atmosphere was hustle and bustle, a little loud, and that's because the place was full with a lineup at the door.   It's a concept that works the place has been open for years and we really enjoyed our meal. We will be back."}
{"text":"Save your money and time - don't bother trying this restaurant! While the servings were generous,  taste of the food was mediocre. Not authentic. Service was terrible and there were just 3 other tables in this huge place so they can't blame it for being busy when we were there.  To give you an idea -- one of our our orders was a platter with a variety of burritos, tacos and enchiladas. Asked the server to clarify what meat was inside each one (my husband would eat the ones with  chicken since I don't eat chicken) , the server said \"  Just use your knife to slice them open to determine what type of meat is inside.\"  Wow...I think they need to be trained  better to say the least! And my sangria came just as we were about order dessert after I had to follow up. At least they had the courtesy to not charge me for it."}
{"text":"The food here tastes delicious and the portion is just more than enough, you can bring home for leftovers.   My party arrived around 7 and because we didn't make reservations, they told us there wasn't space for a book and we had to sit at a table which totally didn't matter to me that much. Just if you want guarantee booth seats, make a reservation.   I was disappointed at the amount of time we had to wait for our food. They said it was taking a while because of another large group and they had to bring their food first. It disappointed me even more when I noticed the table who came after us got their food before us.   The menu is difficult to read. It's in a tiny white font against a black background. They could enlarge their font size.   Overall though, the atmosphere of the restaurant was very comforting and the food was delicious despite the wait. Pictures are below and I'd recommend the shrimp appetizer. If you want to get the amigo platter, let's just hope you have an appetite. I was definitely not able to finish that on my own or you can share with somebody."}
{"text":"Went here with high hopes of some yummy Mexican close to home. DON'T go!!!!!!!! It was ridiculous. There was a grand opening sign on the front of the restaurant although we were handed menus that were very well used. The booths were far too low and I'm 5'3\". Still we were hopeful. We ordered the flautas to start - tasted frozen and bland if not for the salsa. I ordered the chile rellenos with chorizo and my hubby ordered the chorizo burrito. I received the chile rellenos and they were burnt and greasy. Mentioned it to the waitress and she said \"Yeah, sorry about that\" and that was it. The chorizo was loose and hugely greasy. Hubby's burrito was equally greasy and flavorless if not for the salsa. The tortilla was flour, definitely not homemade as we had hoped.   Only thing semi-decent was the green salad and dressing. So unless you are just going to Mexican Amigo for tequila and chips with salsa, DON'T GO!!!!!!!! Overpriced and stomach churning!"}
{"text":"I'll come back in a year...maybe  We had the fish tacos and chicken fajitas, both lacked the flavour and spices you would expect from a mexican dish.  Our waitress was super awkward, her explanations were undesirably lengthy.  She told us that there is a long wait for food, so if we wanted to go somewhere else, we should... Who tells their patrons this?  We decided to wait it out because our waitress promised us complimentary chips and dip.  Well, that never came.  I understand that they just opened and still working out the kinks,but I expected their food to make up for everything else lacking.    Maybe it will be better in a year."}
{"text":"I've drove past this restaurant several times and I decided to give it a chance. I tried the Chimichanga and I was stuffed by the end. It came with lots of sauce and you have a full bottle of sour cream to use if needed (I love sour cream).  After ordering our food did not come for 30 minutes, so I spoke with the server and they quickly prompted the kitchen to make our dishes.  While waiting they gave us some tortilla chips, guacamole and salsa to compensate for the delay.  The tortilla chips were mediocre and nothing special.  Overall, it was a good experience, but nothing really stood out to make me want to come back in the near term."}
{"text":"Never had real authentic Mexican before so I can't judge if this was. But I assumed it would be more flavorful then what I received.  Portions were large and overall good quality, place was nice as were the servers.  However, the food was, well, bland. If I'm hungry and in the area I might give it another try, but it is not a place I would go out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"Visited here for the first time as part of Savour York Region. A pre fixed lunch for $15 could not be beat. We arrived at approx. 1:15pm on a Thursday afternoon and the place had only a few patrons. Staff immediately approached us, seated us, took a drink order and off they went. Was back in less than 5 minutes with drinks and took our order.  For $15:  Appetizer 2 of us got the Taquito. They were excellent. Cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful. 1 person ordered the soup. Loved it, raved about it, linked the bowl clean.  Lunch Main Course 1 person ordered the burrito. When the waiter came to check on it and asked her how it was...she told him to let the chef know that she wanted to marry him. He laughed back that \"he\" was a \"she\" and our friend said if she cooks like this, it didn't matter to her. I guess it was good. 2 of us ordered the Chicken Enchiladas with Mexican rice. They were excellent, stuffed full of chicken and smothered in cheese. The rice was flavourful and cooked to perfection  Dessert We all had the deep fried pasty covered in sugar and cinnamon. It was heaven on a plate.  When we left we all agreed that we'd be back. It was great. Food was excellent, staff friendly."}
{"text":"Food was really subpar. I had the enchiladas and it was literally TOUGH to eat. The enchiladas were drier than the Sonoran desert and I probably would have had an easier time trying to cut through an armadillo shell. My companions opted for the fajitas, and while their experience was better than mine, they still noted that it was subpar at best.  The only highlight of the meal was the dessert - the taco caramelized banana was neat.  It's a massive restaurant and it was pretty much dead empty on a Wednesday night, so maybe that had something to do with the food quality. Service was quite pleasant at least."}
{"text":"Great food, great music, great ambiance! You need to try the queso fundido, the chorizo is amazing, really great place to come on a weekend since they have live music. Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have never done a one star review until now (edit: I have done one other 1star). This place is weak. Paid $51 dollars for two margaritas and a dinner plate.  First off the bartender had to read instructions on how to make a house margarita.   Second, the frozen margarita I ordered had ice cube chunks in it.  Third, the beef burrito I ordered came out in 3ish minutes which means they definitely did not cook it fresh (the taste of it backs that statement)  I am from Texas. I know Tex-Mex. This is not it. I am on a work trip staying at the Westin across the street and did not have many choices, however, I would go to the Wendy's next door before I go here again."}
{"text":"This review is solely based on my first experience. My bf and I came here for a late dinner and we were seated quickly. On the left side of the restaurant is the dining area with small tv's in each booth. And on the right side was a big sports bar with huge tv screens. This restaurant is in a plaza and they have limited parking. We came at the last hour and a half before closing and there was still a big party group and a few couples seated. Our server was nice but not very attentive. I ordered the Fajitas and I'm not sure what my bf got but you can see it in the picture below. The Fajitas tasted great, the ingredients were fresh and the rice and grilled chicken was really good. For those sour cream lovers out there, they provide you with a sour cream bottle for your meal! Overall, experience was good. I definitely would come back to try more food items."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Richmond Hill. Definitely worth trying. Arrived Saturday evening at 8:00pm. The place was packed, luckily got one table. The waitress had a sunny smile, very nice and accommodating. The owner of the restaurant came to each table to greet and chat. Very fun and nice guy. He said he owns another Italian restaurant in Markham.  The food is all very tasty, fresh and well presented. Will come back very often for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for a team lunch with coworkers.  Doesn't seem like a place I'd go for dinner even though the interior is relatively nice and there's a decent drinks menu.  Had a great strawberry daiquiri which went well with my meal, the rest of my team got pitchers of beer - prices are comparable to any mid-end resto.  The only reason I'm giving it a three stars is not because the food wasn't yummy - it was!  I just thought the portions were way too big (#firstworldproblems) and that kind of took away from the experience because my entire team was falling into food comas after the meal.  We had nachos to start - and they were delicious!  We got a large amongst 8 people, so they gave us two separate plates.  The 'chos were cheesy and crisp and went spectacularly with the guac.  For my main, I had the chimichanga.  This is a Mexican dish that is basically tortilla stuffed with rice, black beans, shredded cheese, and your choice of meat (I decided on the chorizo, you can also get ground beef/fish/chicken/shrimp) The chimichanga stuffing was finished with shredded cabbage, guac, pico de gallo and salsa rojo - also served with a house salad I barely touched cuz the chimi itself..  ..was enormous.  I ate half of it and didn't want to finish the rest - even though it was honestly one of the yummiest Mexican dishes I ever had.  So if you are ever around the area on a hungry weekday.. by all means, c'mere and have yourself some hearty Mexican :)"}
{"text":"Love the Place.... Specially on Saturday, The have an amazing Mariachi band..!!!  I love Mexican food, !!   the Place was really nice, romantic, amazing Waiter !! he was extremely friendly"}
{"text":"I had the chimichunga with shredded chicken  and the stuffing was delicious however the shell wasn't crispy at all... They also threw coleslaw on top of the chimichunga which softened the shell  and it also doesn't make sense since it also comes with a side salad (was a busy plate to say the least).  Very pricey for the quality of food. Service was excellent and the music was nice.  Overall would not come back  as there are better options (i.e. lonestar, planeta  mexico)."}
{"text":"Oh where do I begin? It's a hidden secluded location out in the middle of nowhere. It's sad it's not in the heart of Toronto! This place embodies the resemblance of good Mexican Food. This is the place you want to get a nice Chimichanga with some hot sauce. If you get any of it, grab a nice large glass of Horchata and away you go. This store isn't exactly a 5/5. The servers really don't pay as much attention as they should, however there is room for improvement in every shop. The Horchata is same as you would find, sugary, delicious, not too watery, has a garnish (however they should not garnish with strawberry, especially when it's wilting away in fear of the glass: I usually order the Chimichanga with shredded chicken, but they have plentiful or options. There is black beans, an abundance if sour cream and more sauce to pour on-top upon request. The hot sauce is delightful and they have different kinds. What I wouldn't order is the appetizers, they are small and not worth the price. Your better off getting a main course and leaving it at that. The total bill comes out to just under 25 when you order a chimichanga and a drink! It's for sure overfilling and amazing. Fajitas are okay as well!"}
{"text":"Was driving by and decided to try this place out since it had been a while since we had mexican.  Our server was very nice and helpful with any questions.  I ordered the 3 enchiladas ( one chorizo, one ground beef, one pulled chicken) with rice and sautéed veggies.  My wife had 3 enchiladas (one fish, one shrimp, one braised beef) with rice and refried beans.  We even got nachos and salsa as we waited for our food.  The food was great and at the spicyness level we asked for.  My wife found her refried beans delicious, way better than any canned beans.  My wife ordered the chocolate mousse for desert and when it arrived I saw a white spot on the top.  We had it returned and just cancelled our desert.  The waiter checked with the kitchen and said it was just a frost spot.  Maybe, maybe not? I am giving the review 4 simply because of the desert experience.  I also find the prices could be a bit lower. We will probably go again and skip desert (Menchies is located next door)."}
{"text":"Just alright. Wouldn't really say this is truly Mexican but from the name you may think that. Tried it once probably won't try it again."}
{"text":"I was stoked to hear that they opened a second location near my work. Always great and fresh food, I already have a lunch routine here with my co-workers."}
{"text":"Went in with low expectations after reading reviews and they were confirmed.  Waited 5-10 minutes before a hostess even came to greet us and what a greeting. Hardly a smile to be found.   Once we ordered, we waited an hour before our food arrived and were not even offered chips and salsa. I even had to ask the waitress to bring some and the chips were stale and gross.  The margarita was lacking in alcohol and taste and my taco sald had dried chicken strips and no dressing .   Would not recommend this restaurant at all."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants.  Love the chicken enchiladas with either 3 or 4 flames sauce."}
{"text":"We have walked by this place so many times on our way to munchies. Finally we made it a point of going here, after salivating at the food for this long. This place did not disappoint. Incredible food, staff here are amazing. The drinks were delicious, get the bulldog on special that day. We had the portobello fajitas and 9 layer dip. So damn good. Best Mexican food we've had. Our new go to! Awesome job to everyone at this place. Keep doing what you're doing."}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this place after driving around in the rain in the North York area looking for somewhere to eat. Took a quick skim on Yelp before deciding to go in. Better than expected. I've learned to always go in expecting the worst especially with Mexican food! Decor is standard and clean. Hostess/waitress was not wearing too skimpy an outfit but I guess others would disagree. Hot pants and a tank top? Plus she was on the bit chubbier side so maybe not the best choice for this family-oriented area.   No complimentary nachos and salsa like others have mentioned. Perhaps it was because we ordered the 9 - layer bean dip that the menu said it is a Fiesta in our mouths.  Sorry not really a Fiesta but it was fine. We asked for hot sauce and sour cream. Without eh, with better. Nachos weren't too stale.   I ordered the ground beef, chicken and chorizo chimichanga and my companion ordered the shrimp, short ribs and fish enchiladas. Both not bad. The guacamole that came with the chimichanga was quite fresh and tasty but needed a pinch of salt. Otherwise the chimichanga was stuffed and the meats inside were cooked well. A bit too much beans as I could barely finish 1/3rd of it. The enchiladas were good. He ordered the green tomatillo sauce which I have to admit was well balanced and not overly tart. The deep fried fish was well cooked, shrimp was a bit rubbery while the ribs were dry.  However with the overall flavours,  not bad. I'd come back to try the other stuff on the menu! The sides we had were the refried beans, salad and rice. All not good but what do you really expect from the sides?   Service was good. We left stuffed but satisfied. A good go-to option for Mexican if you are in this area. There really is nothing else. And to respond to a fellow Yelper,  this is loads better than a Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This place really hit the spot. I had a craving for Mexican food and I didn't expect Toronto to have anything that great. Thank God for this spot. Amigos is tasty and the service is great. The owner stopped by to check on us and the server was not just a pretty face, she was really helpful too. I'd recommend the quesadillas and the fajitas."}
{"text":"\"Awful\" pretty much sums this place up.  To start with, the servers were very unprofessional. A server started us off with drinks and then a few minutes later, another server would ask us our drinks. The same thing happened with ordering dinner AND with the bill. By the end of the night, we were served by three different severs.  Until I ate here, I didn't know you could possibly mess up Nachos. There was so little cheese and there was some funky tasting beans on it with a giant blob of guacamole. They used whole wheat dough for the chimichanga which was gross. The cheese in the chimichanga was \"cheap\" and \"processed tasting\" and there was a lack of chicken in it. It was also bland.  The place was not exactly the cleanest. There were three flies hovering around our table the whole evening (in the middle of winter). The entertainment was okay.   I do not recommend coming to this restaurant if you are interested in authentic Mexican food (or anything that tastes good). It is good place for groups though."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, however this is probably the most expensive Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. Some of the enchiladas top out around $15. Service is very good and food comes out very quickly."}
{"text":"Ate here when it first opened sometime back.  Was not that impressed but many restaurants need time to sort things out after just opening. Returned a few months ago.  Still wasn't that much to like.  Food was just okay.  Service was OK.   I do like the decor and ambience of the restaurant. But all in all not somewhere I would come back to.  Although less atmosphere, Lone Star has  much better tasting food than Amigos."}
{"text":"I arrived to Mexican Amigos around 9PM on a weekday and it wasn't too busy nor noisy. The decor and atmosphere felt very authentic to Mexican culture unlike some Mexican restaurants I've been too. Also, the service was very nice and helpful. For example, I asked for some Sour Cream and our server gave us a whole bottle. I ordered a Ground Beef Chimichanga which was definitely bigger than I expected and my friend ordered a Burrito. Their portion sizes are very generous and worth its costs, I couldn't even finish my meal since I was full. The Ground Beef Chimichanga was delicious and very filling. Although, their house salad which came along with my Chimichanga did taste somewhat plain.  Overall, Mexican Amigos is a good Mexican restaurant and I would consider coming back to try their other filling and huge portion-sized food items."}
{"text":"Second time here and both times it's been empty. Typically that's not a good sign but in this case it's all good. The food here is well presented, delicious and filling.  Atmosphere is festive despite the lack of patrons.   I have enjoyed the food and the service is quite good. It's a true meal at meal prices so if you're looking for a quick meal under $10 it's not for you. Portions are generous and would be best shared.   Overall I enjoy it here but would appreciate the option for smaller portions at a smaller price.  Definitely recommend you check it out"}
{"text":"Great location.  Great food. Attentive service. Friendly staff. Huge portions.  I spoke to three staff including the manager and they all say all their meat is halal.   (For the people who are sticklers about it, yes they serve alcohol and some pork. p.s. chorizo = pork sausages).  Me and my family-of-five went for my birthday on a Wednesday evening.  That atmosphere is a very spacious and has lots of seating areas.  The staff was very friendly and attentive. They were very responsive and went and found out answers to our questions about the food very promptly.  Anytime we needed something she went and got it right away.    We ordered chimichangas, enchiladas, flautas, a fajita dish and a 9 layer dip. The dishes were very plentiful. In fact I could only eat half of my enchilada.  They also provided sides with each meal. In some cases you could pick two sides.   They gave us a bottle of chipotle sauce and a bottle of sour cream  at no added cost to add to your dishes as you wish. They also gave us additional fajita wraps without charge.  The food was very flavorful and tasty. I would say it's very authentic. Nothing Americanized here!  We had the fried ice cream.  One order gives you two huge scoops.  It was my bday and they sang happy birthday, gave me something special and brought out sombreros for my whole family to wear. They took pics with our phones for us, so that was cool. Not many restaurants do something special on birthdays anymore.  My dad even left his hat there by accident . I went back 1 whole week later to see if they have it and they totally kept it the whole time.  p.s. there is no tip included in the bill as a previous reviewer claimed. I posted my reciept as proof.  Awesome food. Huge servings. Great friendly and attentive staff. Tasty food and great atmosphere!!!   GO HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"Top rating for horrible service.   Food is good for uptown mexican but not worth price and horrible service....."}
{"text":"The place is quite causal and plays Latin music, which gives a Mexican atmosphere to the restaurant. We got seated as soon as we were in the restaurant, as it wasn't very busy. However, the people behind us in line had to wait to be seated.   After a few minutes, a waitress came to take our drink orders. As we were not ready yet, I ordered a hot water, which came quickly. Later, a different waitress came to take our food orders, at which point we also ordered drinks.  Food came fairly quickly, as if they only had to warm and assemble the food. The drinks had been waiting on the bar since not long after they were ordered, but they took longer to arrive than the food, at which point my bottle was warm and the ice was melting.  Later we were looking to order dessert, and I was trying to signal waitstaff for a while before a manager came over and took the order.  FOOD - enchilada: not flavourful, had to add extra chipotle sauce to strengthen the flavour - steak tacos (bf's order): steaks were overcooked and little chewy, not flavourful - Oreo churros: some bits were burnt and too much sugar on top, but the actual churro dough was mediocre - Tequila Mockingbird (bf's order): as mentioned above, ice were melting which made his boozy drink watery - Jarrito Mango: warm... the glass of ice they gave was melting before we got it, making my Jarrito watery as well  SERVICE - I HAVE HAD BETTER!  - foods definitely not worth the price, I have had cheaper but better quality and service"}
{"text":"Halal!!   I find the service and food here amazing. The taste, the tender meats, and the authentic feel is perfect.   We have had the wings, which are one of the best wings out there. The combo platter was delicious with tastes of burritos, enchiladas, and tacos.   Absolutely one of the best Mexican places out there. I'm definitely going to be a regular here."}
{"text":"A cool place, authentic flavours, where you can find the most popular dishes in the Mexican cuisine. The place is very casual though, so good for casual outings, groups, a quick bite, nothing to take your date to by any means! The couple of times I've been there, the music was too high, Tvs blasting, too busy and crowded, but the food was delicious.. I've tried their quesadillas, enchiladas, tacos, nachos, burritos, and they're all great! You can enjoy them while sipping a cold frozen Corona! Good place, recommended if you're into some cool Mexican food"}
{"text":"This place is probably the worst Mexican place I've been too. The prices were a little too high for food that was way below average. I ordered the pork carnitas which I ate a little and ended up sending it back. It tasted like nothing, no seasoning or anything. I've had Mexican before and it was nothing like this, this place was frankly and embarrassment to the Mexican culture."}
{"text":"Was in for lunch but all they had was the regular menu. Food was not bad but could find better. Was a nice experience, paid $20 dollars for lunch, for this reason I won't return."}
{"text":"Went once.  That was enough.  I'm not sure if they're trying to be a nightclub or what, but it's definitely not a place to go for passable Mexican food.  Their \"freshly-made guac\" is freshly made as in they opened up a package of that \"fresh\" grocery store stuff.  Service was pretty poor and the whole atmosphere felt awkward.  Also, there was not a Mexican to be seen....where are their amigos?  I know...no Mexican would be caught dead here; it's a sad nod to Mexican food at best, and it's expensive."}
{"text":"I was a little bit confused about this bar/mexican joint. It looks like a sports bar place that was turned into a mexican restaurant. The server wasn't really friendly at first but was okay by the end I suppose. I had the mushroom enchilada and it was alright. Nothing I'd really want to come back for. I had rice and beans as my sides and they were good. I liked how they bring you sour cream and cheddar cheese so you can add as much as you want."}
{"text":"It was Friday night and we're all craving for Mexican food. I read the not so poor reviews but it's the only Mexican restaurant nearby. So we went and what can go wrong if we try this place. Then entrance was not that impressive. Dirty mats, dirty doors may need fresh paint. It was packed and there was a few birthday celebrations going on. But we managed to get a seat. There was a live music and the noise level was high. I had the chorizo quesadillas. Others ordered nachos with additional charge for meat, enchiladas and fish fried tortillas.  It would have been good chorizo quesadillas but the oil drippings were all over my plate and each bite was a disaster. My hands full of chorizo oil. I used all the napkins to wipe my hands and had to put my napkin on my neck as a bib. I'm like a baby eating quesadillas. I'll never order this again. I'm sure there's a better way of preparing a perfect chorizo quesadillas. But this was a mess. Two stars for making my hands greasy! The nachos were good. Almost every table ordered nachos. The refried beans tasted like taken from a can. Very disappointing. Bill was over $80 and didn't bother with drinks. Overall, it was okay."}
{"text":"One of the newest Mexican restaurants to pop up in the Don Mills area.  The food is typical Mexican fast food rather than the authentic experience I was hoping for.  There are far better Mexican options just a short drive away.    Free parking is a bonus and Menchies is next door."}
{"text":"Lovely staff.. The food is strictly ok though.. Had veg burritos which were nice although would have loved if they were a little spicey.. It needed more flavour.."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday lunch. Service was very friendly and food was average. We ordered the Amigo Platter and Nachos for two people, and it was filling. The platter was great because it comes with tacos, burrito, enchilada, and sides.   Meanwhile, ambiance was decent. There's a bar with TVs and many tables to get seated."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Lots of choices on the menu. Friendly staff handily assisted our party of 10 which included kids. Answered all our menu questions. Notable dishes were the mixed enchiladas, beef tacos, and steak burrito. Beer drinkers in our party appreciated Dos Equis on tap. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I don't think that the world's most interesting man has been here but there is plenty of ads about him and his favourite beer. Haven't been back in a long time but for some reason, wanted to get some chipotle and pico de gallo. After thinking about going to Chipotle, I remembered this place. We moseyed on up and had ourselves a good fill of food. The portions were big and some of it had some heat to it. Washed it down with dos Dos Equis and the meal was done. Go for the Chimichangas. Totally worth it. The tacos are OK, the burritos are fine too. The place is more like a bar than a restaurant now - large seating area for drinkers and the obligatory gals in tight black dresses.  Whatever turns your fancy, the meal is good here if your inner chihuahua is barking for some suds and salsa."}
