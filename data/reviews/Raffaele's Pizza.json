{"text":"Best pizza in town!  I live at 19th Ave and cactus so it's a drive for me to go but it's worth it.  I've been  coming here since I was in high school and I miss the old man  who used to run it but his son took over.  I've never had a problem here and have carried  out and eaten in its a great place!"}
{"text":"I no longer live in Phoenix but every time I visit I get a Sicilian Pizza from Raffaele's. In Oct 2011 I had the lunch special just like we used to get in high school only now it is $5 instead of $3 and grabbed a pizza for take out on another night. Raffaele himself was there on the take out night even though the Aquino family sold the restaurant to long time employees in 2010 or so. I know many from my class at Washington (81) who have continued to eat here all these years and everyone agrees it is still wonderful. No ambiance at all. The restaurant is not the attraction. It is the food! Businesses don't stay open over 30 years if they suck. Do yourself a favor and eat at Raffaele's."}
{"text":"All my life I've been ordering dominos papa johns Pizza Hut until a few month ago I heard about this pizza place. Ever since then I haven't ordered from dominos papa johns. And I live all the way in Peoria I definitely will make that drive just to get some really good pizza and also they don't deliver on my side of town. And also it's hot in there id assume because of the big oven they have so id rather take it to go. And they have the best wings !"}
{"text":"Been ordering the Sicilian Rafaelle Special for years now, and am never disappointed. Don't balk at the $22 price, it feeds the same amount of people as 2 larges do elsewhere, but better quality."}
{"text":"So far i have only tried it once. I'm new to the state and im glad all u yelpers helped me find this place. As soon as i saw it it reminded me of the pizzeria back home. The taste was identical too. I will def be calling back for more. 

The only one thing was they didnt arrive in 45mins like they said they would BUT it didnt bother me because i understand unlike the rest of the naggy ppl in this world.. Hello u aint the only person ordering they do have other customers that called before u. There are alot of other reasons they can have for not showing up in 45 min but its all worth the wait."}
{"text":"The Sicilian Sub here is to die for. It's made fresh right when you order. The dough is slightly crispy and soft when you bite into it and you don't want it end! I live in Surprise and still drive out to get this sub!"}
{"text":"I spent over 20 dollars for a what looked like pizza on the top of a biscuit and that's the way it tasted. The toppings were ok ,the sauce was tasteless overall I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Just called this business to order a pizza, the guy on the phone was so rude that we ended up hanging up and taking our business elsewhere. Such a shame, i love pizza."}
{"text":"Went off the Yelp reviews and decided to order from here. It was the worst food I have ever had. The salad looked like it was a week old...nasty. The boneless wings were literally flat and tasteless. Giving one star because they did deliver on time and was all correct in order."}
{"text":"If you want to get the biggest most bad ass pizza you will ever have in your life, then get the Sicilian. You will thank me later!"}
{"text":"I don't give five stars lighly. This is my first, and it's only for the delivery from Raffaele's because I have never seen the place in my life. 

We (my housemate Joanna and I) ordered a cheese Sicilian because we saw it on the menu and had no idea what that meant, and we wanted to find out. Sure, I could have asked the friendly phone voice, but that would have killed the adventure. 

What showed up at our door (held by a wonderfully cheerful gal in red glasses - sassy!) was a box full of bliss. 16 mounds of pizza each as big as a slab of lasagna. There was a slight kick to the sauce, the cheese was melty the crust was crunchy at the edges, light soft (but fully cooked) at the center. Oh man, was I in trouble... I made it through 3 pieces and then had to go lay on the couch and read a book. But it was so worth it. Mmmmm. 

All that, and they'll bring it to your door!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings , the only down fall is the light rail construction , the place could use a paint job ."}
{"text":"Hands down the best hot wings and pizza in Phoenix! Anything you order is guaranteed to be delicious!"}
{"text":"Tried out the pizza and wings from here. Overall, was pretty impressed. Good food, and a good price."}
{"text":"I've been going here since high school. This is the standard by which I compare all new york style pizza. This pizza is goooooooood! I rarely order a whole pizza but come here during the lunch special (11-2:30, I believe). It's hella cheap too. Everypne, I mean everyone I have try this pizza loves it. I always bring one of these babies to superbowl parties, big basketball games, etc. Ya gotta try it!"}
{"text":"This is a classic old time NY style pizza place that has been around since the 70's.  The pizza is rather delicious and is available in either sicilian or thin style.  I wouldn't compare it to Pizzeria Bianco or Le Grande Orange as their offerings are more in the gourmet form, but if you are looking for something similar to a pizza joint found on the streets of NY this will hit the spot.  For an inexpensive lunch, you can get 2 slices and a drink for under $4."}
{"text":"I work at a hotel front desk and I'm pregnant. I ordered their food online thru Grub Hub because they deliver to my work. There was a mix up and I got bone in wings, instead of boneless. Bones at this stage in my pregnancy make me sick to my stomach. Not only was the wings wrong but the rest of the food was less than impressive. The Chicken Parmiganara was dried out and had little flavor, the garlic bread was the same way. I called and spoke to the manager Mark who informed me he couldn't do anything about it and it must have been my fault because his order doesn't show boneless wings. Horrible service if you ask me! He told me to just speak to his owner in 4 days. I won't be ordering from them again and I'll discourage anyone else to do the same. Sucks because we could've sent them a lot of business from our hotel, but instead they'll just get negative reviews."}
{"text":"Service was bad.   Evening manager kept arguing with me over the phone that the Ham was on my pizza and he wasn't even there.  I ask for the Ham to be delivered separate and he refused.  I am sick with bronchitis and had to order out, but never from Rafaelles again.  The pizza tasted awfu!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good.. the guys there friendly as anyone and the food is awesome... this is the type of place I envision taking up a corner in Brooklyn... a little shady but that pie is amazing!!!! Very good guys... will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food I would recommend to all.my friends and family. This is the best pizza and wings. Nice atmosphere. I love this place. People are friendly service is good."}
{"text":"Let me preface this buy saying not all pizzas are made to be the same thing.  Some are aristocratic in their presentation of flavors and imagery, some are plain and strait forward, and many are in between.

Raffaele's is traditional simple NY pizza the way it is meant to be, nothing fancy just wonderful dough, great sauce, yummy cheese, and whatever you want on it.

This is by far my favorite pizza joint, and at their prices it truly is \"the people's pizza!\"  If you enjoy really crispy delicious crust, you HAVE to try this delightful hole in the wall."}
{"text":"I have been going to Raffaele's pizza since I was in the 5th grade, I am now 48 years old. They used to have the best meatball subs and sicilian pizza and up to about 5 years ago there Italian sausage used to be the best also, but they changed that to the round processed stuff and now the sausage there is ordinary. I just ordered and ate a sicilian pizza from them on 4/11/11 and now it seems they have changed something in their sauce or are using a cheaper cheese as the taste is different and not as good as in the past. I know that they recently have had new owners and if they continue changing the recipe for there pizza, which used to be great, I will be going elsewhere. They used to be the best and now are just ok , to bad, I guess all good things must come to an end like Mr. Morts and Gemco.

{"text":"great pizza and wings, extra large portions"}
{"text":"My first visit was two weeks ago and just now writing the review.   This place is legit and excellent. The restaurant is a small \"mom and pop\" place that has been there forever, and I ordered pizza and spaghetti with meat sauce for take out.... exceptional food and while it's a bit of a drive, very well worth it.  

There are a ton of pizza places closer to where I live, yet I'll be coming back here from now on when I want real Italian food that is reasonably priced and authentic.  

The staff is very friendly, the large family having dinner when I came to pick up my food was enjoying themselves and you could tell Raffaele's was a place they came to often."}
{"text":"Our favorite pick up pizza place. It's been here forever!  Recommended by a friend who lived over by Uncle Sam's on Shea but preferred to drive all the way to 19th and Glendale, so that tells you how yummy it is."}
{"text":"Their Sicilian Pizza is out of this world!! It will feed two people for more than a week, so I recommend having a party when you order it!! You truly get your money's worth!! Chicago style deep dish with all the flavor, sauce that is tangy, not spicy, & toppings & are well chosen!! We WILL be ordering again!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and wings!  Tried both the Sicilian and regular pie, and both were delicious.  Get ready if you order the sicilian...took us 3 days to eat it. The wings are also the best wings you can get on this side of town."}
{"text":"Awesome. Pizza and wing special is the best. Very nice at the counter and take pride in what they do. Been going to over 30 years."}
{"text":"Oh Raffaeles how we love thee....

Really though...

My son & I go to here usually at least once a week. We are never disappointed. They have great lunch specials. During lunch we get a a couple Sicilian slices, a drink and either a salad or wings....$9 and some change...perfect. 
For dinner we usually order the Stromboli and eggplant parm dinner....so good, the best....
Yes, the inside needs a makeover but it's pretty much endearing and shouldn't stop you from giving this place a try. 

Honestly, I've been going to Raffaeles for about 30 years....the staff is always friendly, the food is always great. 

The ONLY suggestion I have is...I wish they would make a half size Sicilian pizza....we love it but ordering a whole pie for 2 people is just too much....I think others would agree."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and worth the wait for delivery.  I always order and expect to wait an 1 to 1 1/2 and I don't care because it is worth it.  My only complaint is they are not open on Sunday.  Great wings and pizza!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! We were so hungry that I forgot to take pictures before starting to eat - the cheese pizza was excellent and the side salads were fresh with mushrooms, cucumbers, tomatoes & black olives. My son got the antipasto salad that was huge and loaded with meat and cheese - we got our food to go and they were smart and wrapped the wing container in plastic wrap. Speaking of wings everyone said they were good. I love that they gave us plenty of ranch! Definitely a new place to us that we will return to!"}
{"text":"This place looks GHETTO! Seriously. Way ghetto. 
It's back behind a 7-11 and wedged next to a gun range (I think it's a gun range... it's a lot of people with guns at any rate)

Walked in and there were a lot of people in there, there are places to sit but you have to go up and order at the counter.  The menu is up over your head and they also have ones on the counter for you to check out (there's a picture of the menu in the Yelp photos)

They have lunch specials with two slices of pizza and a drink for under $5, and different variations of the combo for different prices.

I got the Stromboli and a small (16oz) soda for around $8.50-- the stromboli (a small) was HUGE! and it tasted really good, and it comes with marinara sauce, and I can only imagine how big the large is... geez. I took half of it home and ate it for lunch the next day!

Anyway, it looks like nothing special, but it's pretty good, weird area, and I would probably come back if I had a pizza craving or something."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent hot wings, and their thin slices are fantastic. My only complaint would be the Sicilian slice... the bottom was hard as a rock."}
{"text":"Pizza was a bit too saucy and the cheese was too runny. Cheese stromboli was decent. Great staff, price is good too."}
{"text":"Here in Phoenix for the weekend,  and decided to try a local business for pizza.  Growing up in Chicago, i know a good pizza....The pro..the pizza was real good, and I must say the prices for this place were reasonable, we ordered a large pepperoni/sausage with 25% only cheese, wings buffalo (mild) & honey bbq, with a small dinner salad. The biggest cons were the pizza was not hot, and they forgot my salad that was ordered. When I called to let them know,  they didn't seem concerned with assistance at the time,  however,  I was given the name of a manager to follow up with. Because the pizza was tasty I'm willing to give them a 3...if the service was better it would have been a 4."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood, pizza was excellent and the staff was exceptionally friendly, knew everyone by name..This is a great little place.  We'll be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Beat pizza I've had since moving to Phoenix. Will definitely order again. The crust was charred as if cooked in a wood fired grill. The mushrooms, well. They could be a meal by themselves. This is now my go to pizza."}
{"text":"Been ordering from ghub 4 raffaels 4 a couple of years and always found the food good and fast delivery. However, since the restaurant is near my home, I invited my son and daughter in law 2 lunch. When I got there, I ordered appetizers and waited 4 my guests. I am African American & the people in the place turned & stared at me making me very uncomfortable. I havent ordered from them since."}
{"text":"Great Pizza , Great service . I ordered a pizza to go , but live outside there delivery area and they delivered anyway , Good people making great Pizza . Support this local business . Duc Dominos ."}
{"text":"Super good pizza and they take special cooking requests... Raffaele's Pizza has been one of my favorite neighborhood pizza joints in Phoenix since I was in high school I think. It's tucked away, it's off the beaten path but you will never forget the great quality ingredients and fast service. 

Once a month or two I get a hankerin for pizza. Now that I'm working a gig up north instead of Gino's Central Ave I'm dropping in here. Not only do they do take-out but they are willing to prepare a half-baked uncut pizza so I can continue to commute home downtown and get my oven up to 450+ and do a quick 15-20 min finish for a perfectly baked, crispy and delicious Raffael's pie.  

Old school Local Phoenix Excellence"}
{"text":"love it! They got one of the best subs here. Plus their pizza is always soo tasty."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I have lived in my house for over 12 years and didn't know that this place was just down the block until last week. This place is amazing. Yes, it's a little hole-in-the-wall, but the food is amazing. Pizza that tastes the way it's supposed to, wings that have actual flavor and taste, and appetizers like fried zucchini, mushrooms, and mozzarella sticks. They also have spaghetti, sandwiches, and salads. You can tell from the Its clearly a neighborhood favorite, but apparently still a bit of secret. However, now that I have found it, I plan to return often and to tell many others about it."}
{"text":"Very average pizza and service, though the reviews led me to think otherwise.

Drive by this place on my way home from work every few days, figured we would give it a try. Large pizza and wings for $25 is an OK deal if it's really good...

This place is in an older strip mall that looks unassuming during the day, but at night, with all the riff-raff milling about, is akin to a zombie film shot in a demilitarized zone. Pretty sketchy, I recommend carrying here...

Ordered and drove down about 20 min later. Our order wasn't ready. Bummer, since it was pretty hot inside the dimly lit dining room. Also, ditch the tip thing at the POS; real turn off, and I shouldn't be asked to tip when it's a carry-out order, especially when it's an order that is already running behind schedule. Uncouth. 

Pizza is OK. Cheese is cheap, marginal quality; pretty good amount of oil sitting on top when we opened the box, and very stringy/rubbery. Crust is fine, no chewiness, but has very little flavor and is a bit thicker than I like. Sauce and toppings were forgettable. I don't see what all the praise is about, it's average at best. 

Wings weren't blowing my skirt up, either. Not one of them was crispy. All were bathed in a fairly salty red goo of oil and medium sauce. They weren't the best I've ever had, but certainly not the worst.

I can't say I'd come back, but it was nice to see a small business thriving in the area. It's very serviceable pizza, but it would never crack my top 20 list, some chains included. Definitely worth a try, who knows, maybe you'll enjoy their product better than I."}
{"text":"This place used to to be so amazing, growing up I always went there.  While I was back in Phoenix I tried it to remember the good ole days, however the quality just wasn't the same anymore.  It's not bad, its just not anything special.  

If your looking for great pizza at a good price I recently found a much better place which is close.  Pat's Pizza Plus on 12st and Glendale.  Their ingredients are much fresher, the cooks are real Italians and its a family owned restaurant, and you can taste the difference."}
{"text":"We went there tonight for the first time, based on the other reviews and high ratings.  We ordered a sicilian with half olives and half cheese (my daughter is still not so big on toppings).  Some folks mentioned the prices seemed high, but you get a heck of a lot of pizza for the price.  The sicilian takes about 45 minutes, so you might consider calling ahead.  

But - man. Totally worth the wait. I haven't had a sicilian pie like that in nearly 20 years.  Perfectly cooked (some places give you a slightly undercooked pie), very good sauce, the right amount of cheese - and I appreciated being asked if we wanted a lot of olives (we did).  It was thick, a bit crispy, but somehow also light.  

I absolutely loved it and it reminded me of the best sicilian pies back east.  I had to force myself to stop eating after 4 good-sized slices.

I'm a little frustrated with myself for not coming in before, but I'm new to Yelp, so I just learned about it.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place it's got good food and one of the best pizza in the valley.. I highly recommend this place if u want some good pizza."}
{"text":"I'm on my 3rd time of eating Raffaele's pizza,I give them 5 stars due to the outstanding customer service everyone gives at the place and for having the best pizza & wings that i have had in my life thus far. I would most definitely recommend this place to others in Arizona,its worth a drive or wait for delivery. 5 STARS FOR SURE!!!!!!!!! #TEAMRAFFAELES"}
{"text":"Not a pizza fan, but while out working a coworker suggested this place.  It is absolutely amazing.  It has a cool divey look to it.  I got the Sicilian slice and salad for lunch. Absolutely amazing....And the price wow.  The only reason I give it 4 versus 5 is the cleanliness.  I totally love divey places, but this place could use a clean up.  I looked up at the vent and it was just filthy.  The owner (I believe) is such a nice guy-very welcoming.  As we walked out said have a nice day, and he said something like it is already better since you came in."}
{"text":"Everything I've had from here has been great with one exception, the wings. The sauce was outstanding but the meat on the wings was meager and a little dry. 

Try the pizza (Sicilian or not, both styles are good) first, by the slice if you need to, then get a sandwich the next time."}
{"text":"This place has been here for over 30 years. As an original NYER I know good pizza. The food here is the best in the metro area. I travel from the East valley to lunch here. Both the regular and Sicilian slices are great. They serve up the best #6 (eggplant sub) I have ever enjoyed. There is nothing that is not top quality. The staff has been working forever. No need to go anywhere else"}
{"text":"I was shown this place back in the early 90s, and just ate here again for the first time in like twelve years.  Every single time, I've gotten the meatball and cheese sub.  Since I've moved to Chicago, I still have yet to find a place that made one like that.  

The prices can't be beaten.  The old signed picture of Ronald and Nancy Reagan addressed to Raffaele himself is still on the wall, though the ink has worn considerably since I first saw it.  The ambiance is so everyman, and that really is how it should be, yet the place is a secret that every customer is in on.  It is all about the food.   The sandwich is still pretty much the same, but I think the bread was better back then.  It used to be a well baked bread, and if you grabbed the sandwich with both hands, a meatball would always fall out of it.  So I think the bread might be a bit different from then, but otherwise everything else is the same.  I was seriously stuffed after eating that sandwich, just like before.  I can't give an opinion on the pizza, because I've always had to have that sandwich, no matter what."}
{"text":"This place is scary and dingy and dark. They do have good specials wings and pizza . We love their stromboli. They do deliver. Their pizza sometimes the bottom crust is a little  burnt. We like their sausage  and Hawaii pizza"}
{"text":"I really love the Sicilian pizza here. This pizza is perfect for 5-6 people.

The New York style pizza here is also very good.  You can't beat it in Phoenix.  This pizza reminds me of living back East.  I don't have a picture.  I ate it all."}
{"text":"Went to Raffaele's Pizza based on wanting to eat near this location and from other great reviews on Yelp. 

The pizza was outstanding. Sicilian was out of this word, and the thin crust great too. That's all I had - the two pieces and some water. Yum, yum .. the best. 

I rated it four stars instead of five only because it's a very tiny hole in the wall that didn't have any atmosphere, and only had a few tables. Good thing I got there at 11:30 a.m., as it was packed very shortly after that. 

So, it's not really a place to take to impress a lady, but the food is good. I'll definitely go back, again and again."}
{"text":"Super pizza, consistently from this small pie maker.
Worth the wait, grub hub made it easier than doing it verbally. My tongue has better things to do on the weekend."}
{"text":"Full disclosure to the masses that I've become something of a pizza snob over the years (as my reviews of various valley pizza joints will attest to).  That said, I consider myself a fair and objective judge of different takes on the beloved pie.  There's pizza places everywhere and some really do get creative in their approach, whether its by going deep dish or by using a unique type of dough, or even mixing up unusual topping combinations (i.e. California Pizza Kitchen and the like).  Raffaele's claim to fame is focused primarily on a Sicilian style pie.  As I understand it, that typically means two things.  Squared and thick.  Beyond that my knowledge of Sicilian style pies pretty much ends, but my hopes were high after my co-worker hyped up Raffaele's as his favorite pizza in the valley.  And the decent Yelp reviews help too.

Having been to Atoyac Oaxaca just a a few doors down, I probably should've expected an equally divvy atmosphere, but my co-worker had convinced me otherwise before arriving.  I'm fine with dives, in fact I love ones that serve great food (see my review of Carolina's for proof).  The inside of this joint can not so comfortably cram in about 20 and was nearly full at lunch.  I decided to go simple with my first go around here.  Two Sicilian slices, one with cheese and one with pepperoni.  Total cost along with a fountain drink?  About $6.  Sounds like a pretty good deal if the Sicilian slices are in fact as hearty as anticipated.  The verdict?

I rarely order pizza by the slice like I did today so maybe my expectations need an adjustment, but waiting 15 minutes for two slices of pizza seems a little extreme.  The guys apparently needed to bake a fresh pie as they were out of Sicilian slices when I ordered.  So there was a wait.  When the two slices did arrive, the appearance was that of, well, pretty much a typical pizza.  Just squared.  And thicker.  They didn't taste bad, just average.  Honestly if you've been to Barros, Pizza Hut, Dominoes, Peter Piper, Hungry Howies, or any one of the other gazillion well known pizzerias in town, Raffaele's pizza pretty much is right in line with those.  For some of you that may be a virtue.  For me, it was kind of forgettable.  The cheese was, fine.  The crust was, okay.  The sauce was, meh.  Sorry, but I guess after falling for the likes of Pomo, Bianco, Cibo, and La Piazza this felt like a step backwards.  I understand that might not be a fair comparison, but thats just where my palette stands at the moment.

The staff at Rafaelle's is friendly and the atmosphere is completely laid back despite the aesthetics.  For blue collar folks, neighborhood types, and the lunch crowd, I can understand the draw of this place.  For people really looking for a pie that stands out, I can't say I found any real distinguishing features.  Except for the whole thick square thing of course."}
{"text":"On our frequent lunch visits to Tacos Atoyac, we have always seen this place sitting there, a few stores away, beckoning us to try it.  After the relative failure our previous attempt at trying a new NY style pizza place turned out to be, it took us awhile to build up the courage to try another one, but we finally did it.

Raffaele's is somewhat of a dive, but we did note that at least they had air conditioning, unlike The Ol Whatever It's Called Pizza up on Peoria.  And the inside looked much cleaner.

The have specials on both walls, and you will notice how ridiculously cheap they are.  I went with a Sicilian slice, six wings, and a drink for probably like $6.

The wings were pretty decent.  Not the very best I've had, but I did enjoy them, and they didn't mess me up too bad inside.  If wings don't make my colon explode, I consider that an achievement.

The Sicilian slice was excellent.  Probably the best Sicilian I have had outside of New York.  It's worth going here just for that - a lot of Phoenicians don't know what the Sicilian pizza is:  it is awesome.  If you haven't had one, this is a great place to correct that.

This is certainly not the greatest restaurant in town.  It doesn't even have the best food in town.  But it excels at what it sets out to do: make a good New York style pie for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Hands down Best pizza I have conquered in AZ in 14 years, GO HERE and eat a cheese pizza. It reminds me of The NY pizza that I remember. Well done guys!"}
{"text":"This  is one  of my favorite places to order from, but this is the first time I have actually visited. It is in a small, somewhat run-down strip mall but the pizza is delicious and the service is friendly! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, my wife and I got lunch specials. Chicken wings were great, went easy and got the honey bbq. And two deep dish Sicilian slices that are worth coming back for. Medium drink and under ten bucks. We will be going back here again."}
{"text":"Do it correctly: cheese pizza. They offer toppings, but you won't need them. This isn't Papa John's and it's a waste to cover up Raffaele's craftsmanship with a bunch of other flavors. Cheese slice. Say it again: cheese.

Their hot wings are big and fat and satisfying. Their warnings about the hotter wings are accurate, and you might need to pop an immodium if you overdo it on the sauce. They remain some of my favorite hot wings, and the faint tickle of vinegar that teases your nose and the back of your throat when they put them down immediately gets me excited. 

The decor is perfect. There's a lot of goofy/tacky signs with aphorisms on them like \"The deadline for complaints was yesterday!\" Their menu is done on an outdated Pepsi board where the letters have uneven kerning. It's usually a bit warm inside. It's the platonic ideal of a pizza place; bask in its correctness.

Similarly, because it is a perfect pizza place, it would be a mistake to order too far from pizza and wings. If you ask for a salad, they're going to give you some iceberg wedges with antipasti ingredients tossed on. You've been warned. 

Cheese pizza. Hot wings. The end."}
{"text":"We ordered the family meal which consisted of \"16 pie and 25 wings.. The flat pizza was nice, nice fluff, crunch, and give .... Not too salty... Decent slice of pizza... Nice...going on the chart...As for the wings/ I admit I picked the wrong sauce for them , it was the hotter sauce( way too salty) but the wings could have been cook better too... It's all in the skin.... Crispy yet juicy and tender in the inside... Not a chewy and rubbery texture....hate those wings... They tend to get slimy...The sauce was way too hot for comfort consumption....this is a total carry out place cause the scene is dead here... Think of that Asian joint you love but is a bit creepy for dine-in.... Exactly..... For pie?, awesome!....or at least a close 2nd -3rd... I'll check for anything else on their menu and keep you posted.... Good luck searching for the next jem... Until then keep trying!:)"}

{"text":"This one was huge to me, I've waiting a long time because I did have to travel out of my way to get here. It was also huge because of the \"yelp hype\" this place gets. I was thinking, this HAS to be awesome!

Well I did it! I got a Sicilian pie for pickup and drove down from north phoenix! The place is as described, it's not in the best neighborhood but nothing I think anyone needs to fear. It looks worse than it really is. The inside does look like a corner pizza shop in the Bronx... I like that so points awarded there!

The service was AWESOME, everybody there were friendly, welcoming, and thoughtful. That means a lot these days so they scored a lot of points there. First time in there and I met a couple who were also both from NY, we had a great conversation and I was happy to meet them... got some points scored there as well. Their customers are awesome (which says a lot)!

So I get the pie home... open the box and it looks just like the yelp review photos. Consistency! Major points scored there! I couldn't wait to try it and yeah... this is a good pie! Good dough, cooked perfectly, great sauce, good cheese.. who can ask more? This tastes like home!

My kids try it.... They LOOOOVE IT!! Very HUGE points there!! They don't like many things.. this, they loved!

There were still PLENTY of left-overs, so they got wrapped up and put in the fridge. Next day, took a couple of slices out, threw them in the over, and BAM!! It still tastes amazing!! So the fact that this pizza reheats really well scores even more points!!! Picked it up on Friday night and it was gone by Sunday night! I enjoyed it ALL weekend long!! Amazing! Thank you guys!!
This place lives up to the hype.. I highly recommend to anybody!!! Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Sicilian NY pizza ever! Being from NY, mom and I tour different pizza establishments regularly. This is still our favorite. Preeps r constantly coming in for take out no matter when we eat there. Established in 1974. Gotta try Raffaeles!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza and wings! Try the Carolina gold. The employees are awesome too. This place is awesome for a good pie! You won't be disappointed... We bring all of our family and friends here."}
{"text":"Very good wings and price is good too!! Plus they are always friendly and always feel welcomed. Good food plus good service keeps me coming"}
{"text":"The pizza was absolutely delicious and it tasted just like the pizza I've had in Philadelphia.

That being said, my only concern was watching the cashier ring us up and then go to put flour on the cutting board to make our pizza without washing his hands. I'm not one to get squeamish but dirty money and food don't mix."}
{"text":"OMG...this place is AWESOME!! The pizza and wings were perfect!! The boys were nice and we most definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Needed to kill time and find someplace for lunch while my husband was having a medical procedure.   Someone at the surgical center suggested Raffaele's because I could get a slice or sandwich.  It was close.

Don't let the strip center fool you.  I pulled in right before open and almost didn't go in, but I noticed there was a line forming before open.  This had to be a good sign right? 

Wide menu, 6 lunch specials and really friendly service.  

Don't let the rough decor scare you away, you will have missed a great opportunity.   True local mom and pop pizza shop."}
{"text":"Love their pizza!! You know I order from them often when they start saying See you soon when they are delivering my pizza. Even left overs are yummy  I am currently obsessed with their pizza lol"}
{"text":"The VERY best New York style pizza in Phoenix!
Been looking for this for a while now, and to find it so close was amazing. Couldn't believe this place has been in same location for 30+ years, and Never heard of it before. The pizza and wings were delicious.. The quality of ingredients impressive, especially for such a hole in the wall.
You dont go there for the ambiance! You DO go there for the delicious food!"}
{"text":"I ordered a large pizza cheese pizza and a bucket of wing. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of wings I received. The wings were perfectly cooked and the ranch was amazing. The phone etiquette when I called was sub par but the service when I arrived was good. They wrapped the box of wings in plastic wrap which kept them warm and the sauce from spilling. They asked how I wanted the pizza cut. They had my order ready on time. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"A true hole-in-the-wall. They have thin and Sicilian style pizzas and for lunch, they offer slices. We tried both. I typically like thick crust but I liked their thin crust better. The bread was over-cooked. I think it was because they re-bake slices. The cheese and toppings were pretty good. I want to try a whole pizza from here. I think it wouldn't be over-cooked if I just ordered a whole one."}
{"text":"My family loves this place! It's a small hole in the wall in a bit of a scary neighborhood at night, but picking up pizza is worth it! Nice big pizza sliced and delicious wings. They are always very accommodating to our specific pizza orders. Our favorite chicken wing sauce is the Carolina sauce, which is no longer in the menu, but they will still make for us. I believe it's a mix between honey mustard and bbq? I don't know for sure. All I know is that it's addicting! Great service, always. :)"}
{"text":"Having been to Italy and knowing what authentic pizza tastes like, this place comes pretty darn close! The best pizza I ever had was in Naples and I can't say this place is as good but it is the best I've found so far in Phoenix! I love this place."}
{"text":"Raffaele's is my favorite pizza place in this neighborhood or most others. While I've never had a New York slice proper, I'm gonna have to assume that it would taste extremely close to this. 

Their sausage sandwiches are also delicious if you're not in the mood for pizza, which I don't personally think is possible but hey, crazier things have happened.

Just be cautious after dark. While you should never judge a book by it's cover, I would never have this book sitting out on my coffee table, feel me?"}
{"text":"I have been ordering from here for a year now and my bad I have not written a review. I have had their sandwiches and pizza. I have also had delivery, eaten in and carried out. (I work about a mile away) Everything from here, staff, quality of food, speed is wonderful. I usually get a philly cheesesteak with the works. Big, greasy and loaded down with meat. Drooling right now. I also order the regular cheese pizza. Thin crust seasoned very well, tomato sauce that you can tell is homemade and has a perfect balance of oregano to tomato, and a divine layer of cheese that pulls apart when you grab your first piece. Their ranch dressing even tastes homemade. I am moving to Portland in two days and I will definitely miss my favorite pizza joint. Please do not judge this place by their location and crazy shops next door. Kudos to Raffaele's!"}
{"text":"I would have loved to eat the meatball sub and wings I ordered but sadly, I never received them. After placing a pickup order online I called to confirm and was told my wait time would be about 30 mins, no big deal. After about 20 mins I realized due to the proximity of my location and Raffaele's (Less than a mile) and the fact that I spent over the delivery dollar amount that I would call and ask for my order to be delivered instead. The woman who works there explained that it would be an additional 30-45 mins for delivery, still not an issue as I had ordered before I was too hungry. Fast forward two and a half hours later, still no food...mind you, I am .3 miles away from this place. I had enough at this point and called to cancel when i was informed the delivery person had already left 10 mins ago. Now, I am no food delivery expert but .3 miles is not more than 10 mins away (Google Maps agrees with me). I informed the employee of this and she said the delivery person had other deliveries to make as well. Well I am (still) not a delivery expert but one would think that because I was so close (.3 miles away, remember?) and the fact that I had placed my order 2 + hours prior would give me some priority, right? Not at Raffaele's! To top it all off, when inquiring about my refund the staff were not at all knowledgeable and referred me to the 3rd party ordering company through which they receive the online orders. Needless to say I won't be waiting on food from here in the future. Every individual who has worked in food service knows customer service is key, someone should alert the staff at Raffaele's."}
{"text":"This was my first Time ordering online via Yelp. I was visiting a friend on the other side of town and wanted to pick up a pizza on the way. As soon as they put the open sign in the window I went inside and they were just cutting my pie fresh from the oven. Was very impressed. Also my first time here... the pie was great. Nothing like real pizza! I'll be back."}
{"text":"I would say that the pizza here was okay. I would have to agree with one of the elite yelpers in that the pizza wasn't the valleys top pizza joints. Although, the Stromboli was to die for. I came during lunch rush and we did a good 20 to 25 minutes for my order and didn't get my order taken for a solid 5 minutes. They were in a bind and I appreciate the hard work that they put in with the personal that they had on staff.

A must try if you are in the neighborhood but I would not go out of your way to try this place."}
{"text":"Not of fan of the tomato pizza..will try a regular pie next time...fast forward a couple of weeks and ordered a regular pie and was delicious..new favorite spot."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get pizza in Phoenix, there are only one or two others that I would buy a pizza from. I have been going there for years. And their sausage tastes just fine to me, at least there is enough to actually taste."}
{"text":"Ordered wings, they were quick and tasted great. The hot is pretty hot, which I can appreciate. No celery or carrots come with the wings, fyi"}
{"text":"Delicious!  My first time, always hear good reviews, finally found my pizza and close to home. We all loved it!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Raf's since the 80s, but I might be done. So disappointed that it's the third time they were way off on he time. Tonight it was two hours from the time I ordered. I called at 1hr 30 mins and they said it was on the way. Sigh. Delivery guy said something about our order getting mixed up with grub hub. No attempt to make amends or apologize. Pizza used to be amazing. I still love the crust but I think other quality has gone by the wayside."}
{"text":"awesome. never mind the location. great sicilian deep dish, great fried zucchini, and fresh salad. sauce is excellent and they give huge sides of ranch. everyone was really nice and prices are totally reasonable. yea! its so nice to find a little hole in the wall that rocks. Can't wait to try some more stuff."}
{"text":"Excellent, you would think you were in NY when you walk in this place.  Best NY pizza in phoenix hands down without all the fancy nonsense.  My kinda pizza place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this pizza place tucked into a small shopping mall off 19th ave. Their pizzas are large and greasy, packed full of flavor and guarenteed to leave left overs for days.

Their wings are saucy and delicious, their hot wings will leave you sweating but sated. Their Sicilian is definitely on my \"to try\" list. The regular pizza is delicious and simple, perfect to ease the tension off a hang over or to celebrate a soccer game."}
{"text":"We've been ordering from here for some time now and I'll be the first to admit that I do not like pizza. I will beg to order anything else before succumbing to peer pressure and dialing for pizza.

That said, this is the only place I will order from. But when we order it has to be either a plain cheese pizza or pepperoni because if you order any other type it will taste dry and like it's been under the heaters for some time. Their wings are okay, way better than some chain place, the fries, though, always are a bit limp and greasy.

The one thing that annoys me the most about this place is the delivery guy who also takes the occasional phone orders. He always sounds like he rolled out of bed wrong and has a complete attitude when delivering. Dude, if you were nicer, maybe you'd get a better tip. 

We'll keep ordering until the day we find somewhere else. We just wish the customer service was better."}
{"text":"You must try the honey gold wings!  They are BIG and saucy. You really don't need the dip. You won't stop eating them."}
{"text":"9/27/2015 I can't think of a higher compliment to pay any establishment than what I'm about to say about Raffaella's pizza: 4 months after freezing, ITS STILL DELICIOUS!   

I bought a large pizza in July, froze it. Tonite, I heated up that last slice and, God, it was great!  Love their sausage and sauce!  Real quality!"}
{"text":"Yummy pizza, great wings, and cool staff! Sounds like a win to me!

The pizza here is so good and they have numerous toppings you can add. Their wings are deliciously sauced and crisp to perfection! 

is a bit old inside but do not let that fool you, because their food and service is great!"}
{"text":"They have the best sandwich in town. If you haven't tried the Sicilian sandwich, you're missing out. That's all I ever get when I go there. Very special. Best sandwich in town for the money."}
{"text":"Fast delivery, great pizza!  Thx!"}
{"text":"Great hidden gem. You can order pizza by the slice. Always fresh, the owner made a fresh pie when I ordered 6 slices so it could be fresh. They also have great meatball subs and some of the best mozzarella sticks you can get in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Billy and the crew are the best, been going here since I was a kid, food is excellent every time we go."}
{"text":"One of my top 3 pizza places in phx!!! Pizza is awesome and owners and workers are awesome!!"}
{"text":"So I got a Sicilian sandwich to go and when I got in my car with it I turned into this shameless ravenous girl and ate it before even leaving the parking lot. 

It was so cheesy and saucy and steamy and sweet and salty and meaty and...drool...

I also captured this really nice picture of cheese oozing out but then managed to lose the picture. I have a feeling my camera was open on snapchat so it didn't save. And now all I have left are my memories."}
{"text":"Billy and guys make THE best wings.  Go for lunch and get the wings and a slice of pizza for a great deal.  You won't be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings in town! I've lived in the area for 20 years and just found this place. It's not the best looking place but the food is great!"}
{"text":"Spaghetti sauce was bland.  The salad was great and there was plenty of food for a very economical price."}
{"text":"The best pizza place in the Valley just happens to be the first pizza my wife and I went to when we moved out here almost 11 years ago. The pizza is straightforward and delicious, the wings are sneaky good and the staff is great. If you're in the area, stop in - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Raffaele Pizza since I was a 5 year old (18 now). My grandpa used to take me and speak Italian to Raffaele. Raffaele also used some cool Italian moves to outsmart some RAYS pizza guys who came into his shop and  pretended they knew the Italian language. (long story...basically rafi told them off in Italian and they smiled back and nodded [cuz they had no clue he was telling them to get the F*&% outta my store]) 

The place has never changed still has the wood paneling with the signed picture of Regan in the corner and the little casers/ pizza hut/ dominos comic that states where the other companies go to get their real pizza (Raffaele Pizza of course). The red hair lady will always ask \"whaddu want\" you say C and she'll say \"one and one\"  then punch the vintage cash register *ding* to bring up the total. 

This is the most REAL pizza in AZ its so GOOD and never gets old. I never go except for the lunch special, any other time and you'll be unlikely to see Raffaele or the red haired lady and you'll miss the soap operas and slices!
I recommend the C on the lunch menu as you get a slice of cheese, Sicilian and a drink for under $5 it's such a deal, you also get to watch the soap opera on the tv in the corner.
I love Raffaele Pizza!!!"}
{"text":"I dont why there is only 15 reviews. I really enjoyed this place. Everyone was super nice.. I ordered 12 wing and they gave us 24..(no extra charge) pizza was just the way I like it and they gave us two free sodas. Oh and they hooked us up with two huge containers of Ranch for our leftovers. Who are these guys..lol  usually i get charged $1 for a little tiny ranch.."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 1979.   They have some of the best pizza in Phoenix.  If you go, you must try their Sicilian pizza by the slice or a whole pie.  The owner is very personal and all the staff make you feel at home.  I go as much as I can.  I highly recommend everyone take a trip to Raffael's Pizza right behind 7/11 off of 19 Ave and Glendale.  They are in a strip  center in the back.  Enjoy if you go."}
{"text":"Raffaele's pizza is splendid and so are the wings. I've only gotten take out or delivery; this isn't really a dine-in joint. They do a large cheese pizza and 20 wings for 25 bucks!~ That is a STEAL considering it is always over 30 bucks with less wings at other nearby places.

The strip mall is ghetto and they don't have a website but the NY style pizza is worth picking up the phone for delivery."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to Raffaele's Pizza and wasn't sure what to expect from the previous reviews.  I Had a small Stromboli and while my first bite didn't wow me, eventually the flavor and taste grew on me quickly.  Maybe my palate was off this night but if I get to try another dish I will certainly write a follow-up.

Ambiance is lacking but customer service seemed up to par and accommodating.  Nothing to dismiss this place for from other reviews.  Looking forward to trying it again."}
{"text":"This local pizza joint gets an A+ from me and my boyfriend. We are lucky enough to be neighbors with this place, and are impressed with it over and over again!
We always order the Raffaele's special (which is a little steep at $20 for a large) but its always worth it. 
A down to earth local pizza joint that is consistent, friendly, and oh so yummy!"}
{"text":"This is what I call a true blue dive. The outside was very unassuming and we were a nervous to go in but the yelp rating is what got me to walk though the door. Inside the place is very old looking and not decorated too much. One thing I did see is a signed picture of Ronald and Nancy Reagan. Very cool. 

The owner took our order and was very nice. He helped us order and we got his lunch special instead of paying even more. I'm always a sucker for meatball sandwiches so I had to try this and plus this is a pizza dive so I had to try the typical thin crust pepperoni. I really enjoyed the meatball sandwich. Nice and hot and juicy. They put about 5 or 6 meatballs in the sandwich which gives your a nice bite every time. The tomato sauce was pretty good too. So the meatball sandwich passed my test. Yum yum. I also enjoyed the pizza. Crust was very good. So I enjoyed it. 

So they have thin and thick pizza crust. There were people coming in and out of this little place while we were there the whole time. Pretty impressive for a little pizza place. Only thing i didnt like was their air conditioning. It wasn't working very well and you had to go in the kitchen to get to the bathroom. Dirty bathroom but remember this is a dive. So not bad place. Pretty good..."}
{"text":"This place has been a staple in Central Phoenix for years! I remember eating wings and pizza when I was substantially younger, and I'm now 32!! Hope it never changes!!!"}
{"text":"They use the manufactured sausage...... you know the little balls of joy.... sauce isn't bad..... This is a major pet peeve of mine. It must be stopped. Nothing drops the score more than the use of this. 
Does anyone remember La Palermo on 35th avenue and Bethany Home??? The best.  Their sausage was real. I'd drive 50 miles for that again.  
The Sicilian at Raffaele's was just OK."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and wings. Friendly service and reasonable prices.  I wish I lived close by!"}
{"text":"Real NY pizza made by New Yorkers. Been my favorite pizza for years. Perfect crust, perfect sauce and perfect proportions of sauce and cheese. Absolutely satisfies the pizza craving. Tons of topping choices, including anchovies (my fave, not always available in Phoenix).

It's a tiny storefront located vertically in a strip just north of Glendale before 19th Avenue. You can't really see it from the street. There are a few tables if you want to eat in and check out the menu. I've never eaten at the restaurant.

If you're calling in an order, you'll immediately realize that most customers are regulars and know exactly what they want. They expect you to get down to the business of ordering right away; kinda no nonsense like a New Yorker. But if you ask for help and understand they'll need to put you on hold to take other orders, you'll get your questions answered. 

So save the airfare; get your NY pizza here!"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, friendly, great subs and pizza!
Sad that closed on Sun and Mon."}
{"text":"ordered delivery on a night I was too beat to go out and pick up.  Delivery was at the outer end of when it was expected, but that's fine.  it was all hot and fresh.  enjoyed the meal and I'm sure I'll order again sometime."}
{"text":"It is the best pizza I have had. I would recommend the Sicilian with everything. It's truly amazing. It is a bit pricey but that thang is worth it."}
{"text":"When I walked in today, I was immediately taken back to my days going to Washington High School, when we would go here for lunch and order the $3.00 lunch special, two slices of cheese and a drink. Every once in a while if my job at the car stereo store gave me a few extra hours, I'd splurge and get pepperoni.

I remember it for being the best pizza ever.

Today, just not the same. The $3.00 lunch special is no loger available, as WHS has a closed campus. The pizza is still the same as I remember it, with a slightly rubbery cheese, a great crust, and the perfect amount of sauce. This is what an old school NY pizza place should be. I do the garlic salt, oregano, and red pepper on my pizza and there is something about it that just makes me feel the ultimate comfort. Comfort is a tough thing for me to feel. 

I've never had the wings, or sandwiches, or pasta, or really anything other than cheese/pepperoni pizza here. It's really all you need to enjoy the place. Everyone I know that has been there has loved it, and to the same degree, everyone I know who hasn't, has talked crap about it. I give it 3, not because of the food, or because of the location, or the atmosphere, but for the fact that in comparison there really are better pizza places in town, and since I gave some of them a four, I guess 3 is all I can give this one.

It's a great neighborhood pizza place."}
{"text":"I tried this place twice. And both times did not wow me. And they tasted like dough you get at a grocery store and regular tomato paste. Wasted a lot of money here and deeply regret it. I guess I'll just drive out farther to get my regular pizza joint. This place was a big disappointment. Wish I could get my money back. And give it zero stars."}
{"text":"I'm in town on business and had to order pizza for about 50 people with little time to spare! I found Raffaele's Pizza here on yelp and seeing that it had good reviews and was close to where I'm working I decided to give them a call. Honestly, I thought they would think I was crazy needing 12 pizzas at noon on a Saturday ASAP but the manager could not have been nicer or more helpful to me. He not only helped me figure out how much pizza I needed by asking demographic questions about the group I needed to feed but he also got all the pizzas done in 45 minutes, provided plates, AND gave me a 10% discount. One other thing that was extremely helpful was that he helped me figure out what type of pizzas to order (veggie, pepperoni, etc.) based on what people normally like. Talk about excellent customer service! 

The pizza was really good and everyone seemed to love it! We went with a NY style pizza which is my personal favorite! It was certainly a crowd-pleaser. The sauce was particularly delicious!"}
{"text":"There is no better in Phx. This is a single store, mom and pop type pizza shop that has been successfully operating on the same intersection for at least 30 years! Obviously many people must like it. It has been a staple in my family for at least 30 years. I don't live in AZ anymore but visit this place every trip to the hometown. Their thin slice cheese is a New York reminder and the sicilian is awesome too. They have the best meatball and cheese sandwiches on the planet and I am not supposed to tell you how good thier unique sicilian sandwich is because they make them in limited quantities and if the word gets out, they will run out of them even earlier in the day and I'll miss out on getting mine when I drop into town."}
{"text":"I lived near this restaurant for 11yrs and never once tried it. Today was my first time and I can say that the pizza and wings are awesome. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall for sure, but it reminds me of shops back home in New Jersey.  Wings are decent and the pizza is traditional.  A tad bit pricey.  Wings and one pizza ran me $33.   I have been there twice and it was good both times."}
{"text":"Man this ANTIPASTO salad. I mean dang. Meat, cheese overload, dressing on point, olives and other veggies so fresh. Its a BIG salad so prepare to share. All of co-workers love this place. No matter what we order!!!!"}
{"text":"Always friendly, really good pizza at great prices!   definitely a must!"}
{"text":"Grew up eating Sicilian sandwiches from here for 20 years.  Moved away after joining the military.  Still have relatives who live in Phoenix and they have shipped frozen Sicilian sandwiches to me via UPS packed in dry ice.  I've traveled the world (including Italy), and I can honestly say Raffaele Pizza does not disappoint when it comes to good food."}
{"text":"In from cleveland...looking for good pizza, found raffaele's....loved it.  Great pizza and great service locked inside a dive of a strip center."}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the pizzas, fried zucchini and most of all the people. It is a must try for everyone!"}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was good. But i Hated the salad. I was Very disappointed in this sorry excuse for a salad. They literally took a Dole Express premade salad with the carrot slices and purple cabbage and poured it into a to go container and called that a Damn salad. Red tomatoes were pink. Ugh. Never again!! These people owe me $5."}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood pizza place.  The pizza is yeasty and bubbly crusted; foldable.  Amazingly good and fresh ingredients on a saucy cheesy piece of heaven.  It is right by home and i could eat here once a week - easy."}
{"text":"Got to try The Raffaele 14 inch Special. The pie has 7 toppings on it. Was baked to perfection with a flavorful marinara sauce that helped to highlight the tastey contrast of the crispy crust. I had a side order of ranch for dipping. Now I look forward to trying Raffaele's Sicilian on my next visit. Till then, CHEERS!!"}
{"text":"Wow, the reviews are misleading. This is not great NY style pizza. With that said, there was nothing bad about it I suppose. It was just okay, Arizona pizza, sigh again! I knew when I saw the crumble sausage I would be let down, and I was. For Az folks it is probably a four or a five for me a three. I would go back to try their Sicilian Style to see how that is. 

The guy was pretty nice who helped me too. The inside is very hot and a bit shabby but that never deters me. If you like pretty don't go here. Lol!

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.he ratings fo rhti space are a bit off."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best, if not THE best pizza in Phoenix. It's been here for 40 years; as a kid, my family picked up pizza from here on a weekly basis. I came back into town, after moving away, for work and I stumbled across it again. the Sicilian pizza is amazing and the \"standard\" pizza is by far some of the best I've had in a long time. My favorite, obviously, is the Sicilian (corner piece).

I am heading back to Portland and I will be taking two whole frozen pizza's with me (After I order them, of course).

this place is well worth seeking it out for a slice!

I wish I could get this kind of pizza in Portland, OR!"}
