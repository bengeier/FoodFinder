{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and the wait staff is great but the food not so hot. I have never eaten such greasy food in my life. There were puddles of oil on my friend's pizza and my roasted potatoes were dripping in oil. So unappetizing. I will never go back to another Scaddabush especially since there is much better Italian food in Woodbridge. Romano's is a much better choice."}
{"text":"Not recommended. Drink order was wrong even though I was very specific. Server changed though didn't seem to care. No apologies.  Ordered one of the specials. The spaghetti pie. Was supposed to come with Bolognese sauce but did not.  Was supposed to have \"crushed meatballs\" inside. But no meat could be found. Didn't look anything like the photo on the menu. All in all the photo and description was quite deceiving.  Got some coupons for next visit but I won't be using because I won't ever go back."}
{"text":"We tried to make a reservation for my friends birthday because it was going to be 15 people. They don't take reservations. We had to book another restaurant because we didn't want to risk a long wait. The sad part was the woman on the phone didn't care at all"}
{"text":"Came to try the out this location since it is newly opened in Woodbridge. The food tasted the same as the other location downtown, which is good consistency. However, service was  horrible and no where close to being comparable to downtown. Our server Adrien forgot our order which in return we waited for about 35 minutes for our appetizers to come (all we got was a simple \"sorry\"). Throughout our meal she was no where to be found and when we actually made eye contact with her to come over to our table, she hastily walked away. It also took 10 minutes to bring the bill, and she stood so close to us when we were using the machine that we ended up leaving a pity tip. Never knew Scaddabush would hire such unprofessional servers"}
{"text":"New favourite Italian restaurant. Wow, it was good. Specifically the ingredients in the entrees and appetizers were fresh and extremely tasty. Have never had better tomatoes. Quite impressed and have already recommended it to friends."}
{"text":"I've never had \"authentic\" Italian food before, so I really have nothing to compare this to, but I've thoroughly enjoyed the food both times I've been here.  The decor is very clean and modern from the moment you walk through the door. It's very spacious as well. The ambience is just terrific. I had exceptional service the first time I went, but the service the second time was considerably slower.   My friends and I ordered the goat cheese and avocado bruschetta as an appetizer and it was phenomenal. Highly recommended. I can't really remember the exact dish I had for dinner, but it contained salmon and I did enjoy that as well. My friends and I also ordered a pitcher of sangria and although it did taste good, for the price it really isn't worth it.  I can't really complain about my experiences here and I will definitely be back in the future!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant franchise for the first time. Atmosphere was beautiful and our service was good. When we got there we were given bottled water that was sitting on a cart .... warm...I ordered their Caesar salad as a starter and their famous meatball as an entree. I found their salad to be spicy...which I didn't mind but wasn't informed of when I ordered it. We had other guests with us that didn't care for the spicy Caesar.  The meatball itself was good. Nothing special tho. I get better recipes from recipes.com.... We ordered the grilled cheese for my daughters. The bread was more of an artisan type.... much too hard for my 4 and 2 year old. Fries were ok. We returned the grilled cheese and the manager credited us as soon as I showed her how I can put nails in the table with it. Overall experience was ok. Nothing special. Same caliber as Kelsey's, Jack Astors etc..."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to give this new establishment a try having received some coupons in the mail. The place is neatly decorated and open, the staff are super friendly, and the menu is focused on Italian fare.   Our server, Emily, was real nice and made our \"day off\" enjoyable. I had a special request to make my spaghetti and meatballs angry, asking for the chef to make it a spicy arrabbiata sauce, and Emily came through and got me what i desired! :) The giant meatball in the middle of the spaghetti noodles was so soft and flavourful, just the way a perfectly cooked meatball should be. The pasta is fresh made and cooked to perfect al dente. The Sunday sauce was lovely. Everything else was very good, primavera pizza was excellent, crispy with fresh and clean tasting toppings. Not greasy at all. The polenta toys and rosemary garlic fries made for tasty side treats, as were their cocktails.  We also got complimentary dessert (nice!) but we were already too full to indulge in their zeppole, but we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My parents and I came here on a Saturday night and was seated within 30 minutes I believe! First time here so we didn't know what to order or even where to start! Our server, Lianna (I believe), was super patient and friendly. She recommended us to try their house made mozza ball, being a cheese fiend, I did hehe.   For our appetizers, we ordered their prosciutto board and bruschettas. CAN I JUST SAY HOW AMAZING THEIR MOZZA IS!? Bomb. Anyways, bruschetta is always good, can't go wrong with it. Overall, 10/10 for appetizers.  For our mains, we ordered the steak & fries, zucca ravioli (I added grilled chicken), and the fettuccine capri. To be quite honest, we weren't very happy with our mains... other than the fettuccine Capri. The steak came out a little more well done than we had hoped (didn't wanna cause a commotion so we didn't send it back). The zucca ravioli was... interesting, but decently good. Overall, mains were 6/10.   The best part: the dessert! We ordered a tiramisu - mind you, we never order tiramisu when we go out because we make it at home (bias opinion) but my goodness gracious, was this tiramisu delicious. For $9, it came in a decent sized cup. It wasn't as smooth as we make it but nonetheless still delicious.   Overall, decent experience. Would come back for the appys and to try their pizzas!"}
{"text":"Hard to review, since we didn't eat there.   But after waiting 10 minutes for a table in a restaurant that was at least a third empty, it seemed like a good idea to leave.   Overall ambience seemed nice and the front reception staff were pleasant. But they were clearly understaffed and we weren't prepared for a long night of waiting."}
{"text":"Our server was nice but he forgot our order. Took over 20 minutes to get our bill. The appetizers were good. We had calamari and bruschetta. I hated my chicken parm sandwich because the sauce was waaaay too sweet."}
{"text":"For what you pay, the quality is lacking.  I also don't appreciate rebranding a location from what used to be Alice Fazoolis and trying to pass it off as something better (I've visited AF on a Friday night once before the rebrand since every other restaurant in the area had about an hour wait time except AF who was barely busy - clearly going bankrupt, and still had a mediocre experience.)  After the rebrand they obviously tried to pass it off as a new 'higher end' restaurant but it's smoke and mirrors as they were still serving pretty much the same menu/recipes, decor, staff, but at higher prices and smaller portions - no effort made other than slapping on a new sign.  If you're going to rebrand at least do a better job at removing the previous brand and elevate the experience.  It's pretty much Alice Fazoolis undercover trying to get business from customers who don't know better, sad. Disappointing experience overall and felt mislead after realizing this was the same old Alice Fazoolis that was pretty much suffering as a business.  I left with around a $45+ bill and feeling hungry since i was splitting a meal with my partner (family size salad and pasta with chicken) which i was told by the server was enough to feed 4 people, LOL clearly the server eats like a bird?  There were a few scraps of chicken that we had to split up evenly since there wasn't much to begin with to go around.. wouldn't ever recommend this place, and would not go back."}
{"text":"I noticed that this place popped up a couple weeks ago when I was running errands at the surrounding stores and made a note to check it out so when my coworker asked to grab dinner we both realized that we had been wanting to give this place a try. Now I had never been to a Scaddabush location before but I was pleasantly surprised.  The day was beautiful so we decided to sit on the patio under the leafy canopy. The decor is so cute, totally my style with mismatched furniture and a rustic aesthetic. Our server was amazing! She was genuine and cheerful and looked like she actually enjoyed her job. She was also very knowledgable about the menu, giving us a rundown of specs and some of the favourites.   I had a peach bellini to start and it was tasty! It was nice and slushy and not overpowering, perfect for post-work drinks. As an appetizer we got the Zucchini Fritti which was absolutely amazing. Contrary to most places that offer app's that are on the smaller size, there is none of that here. We got six huge fried zucchini pieces with a large tub of tomato sauce to dip. This would be amazing for larger parties as it feeds quite a bit and is also extremely filling.   For my main I ordered the Pesto Pollo Fettuccine as the waitress mentioned that they make their pasta fresh daily and I was not let down! The sauce was the perfect ratio of creamy to pesto, allowing it to not be too heavy either. Although be warned that the portion sizes are HUGE and when contemplating between the \"small\" versus \"regular\" portions think with your head and not your stomach! If you want to share amongst friends however I'd recommend the \"regular\" size.   I would definitely come back again and hope to soon. Maybe next time I'll take a seat in the main dining hall as the decor and vibe looked wonderful there as well. Overall it was an amazing experience, from the food to the service!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Scaddabush I really enjoyed it but the second time around the food and service were okay. Not sure if I would go again."}
{"text":"Get there early for dinner on a weekend because they are busy and don't take reservations.  I ordered the chicken avocado BLT with soup.  I was served a grilled vegetable sandwich with soup by mistake.  The tomato soup was very oily.  In fact, the oil could be seen floating in the small bowl of soup.  I bit into the sandwich and a big rubbery piece of eggplant fell out.  It was inedible and not what I ordered.  I pointed out the error to the server.  By the time I got the correct sandwich my friend had almost finished eating.    To the restaurant's credit, the manager came to our table and told me I would not be charged for my meal.  I didn't even ask to speak to the manager or suggest I get any discount.  The decor and ambience were very nice.  But don't order the tomato soup or anything with eggplant!"}
{"text":"If you have a family over 6 people dont waste your time coming here! We wanted a table for 7 They told us to wait 45 minutes and we were waiting for 1 hour and 25 minutes still no table. They kept saying 20 more mintes. I asked them to put 2 table together and they wouldnt. It was my husbands birthday we ended up leaving. Worse customer service and they're a bunch of teenagers who have no manners."}
{"text":"Favourite restaurant in the area! We absolutely love their food, service and atmosphere. love the kids meals, the Gluten free options are fantastic- never have to worry about quality or taste. Great drink menu! Could improve dessert options!"}
{"text":"The location by sq 1 has been mostly good so had expectations for this one. They superseded them, super nice at the front hostess desk and the wait staff had personality and was personable with the whole table of 10.  Menu items are staples but their special features were tantalizing!  Grabbed the grilled veggie sandwich with the tomato fennel soup. Practically licked the bowl clean, sandwich with the pesto was a good portion. I packed half for home.   Has their goat cheese and beet salad before and honestly they should add more than a dime of goat cheese or change the name to just beet salad!  The peeps i was with ordered pastas, flat bread, polenta tots, calamari and fresh mozza balls to share and they enjoyed the food immensely. Didnt hear a peep from them until apps were done    Wish they had a few more vegan friendly items on the menu but i guess it isnt fair since they are known for their cheese!!!!"}
{"text":"Overall enjoyable meal.  One of our party had a salad with some spoiled greens and sent it back and nothing was done about it. Just got a \"sorry about that.\"  My pasta and my husband's pasta were tasty and good value.  My only complaint was that it was a less than enjoyable experience due to the bad behaviour of many kids around us.  Nothing the restaurant could do about that unless they had a small area for people who want to dine with adults, but can't really see a way this could be done.  Not sure if we'll return as there is obviously too much emphasis on family dining and we prefer a restaurant that is more adult-oriented.  We've done our time raising a family and prefer some peace and quiet while dining out.  And before anyone castigated me about this I must say I was actually kicked on the arm by a child at the next table while they were running around."}
{"text":"Service was very quick and our waitress was attentive. Ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and the naked and they were both on point. I usually order a pasta but decided I would try their pizza instead. Ordered the primavera pizza and omg it was the grossest thing ever!! The eggplant and zucchini were so bland and the crust was so dry. I ended up picking off the veggies and just ate it with the goat cheese and even then I couldnt finish it. Lesson learned I'll just stick to their pastas."}
{"text":"Went there for a family birthday dinner. They said the wait time is 30 minutes. 1 hour and 45 minutes later and we are still waiting. I understand they are busy but they had no way to solve the issue. Just kept telling us that we have to wait an extra 20 minutes, every 20 minutes. They dont even apologize for their horrible service."}
{"text":"I see people here talking about the mediocrity of this place so maybe my expectations were lowered but our first visit here was a great time.  Love the decor of the place and the staff were Incredibly friendly and accommodating, especially to the kids.  Food was really something else. We had the goat cheese/avocado bruschetta (yum!), the zucchini fritti (amazing), as well as a kids cheese pizza anf some incredible butternut squash ravioli with fried sage and some sort of savory crumble.  I'm dying to come back and try out more on the menu, as so far i'm pretty impressed!"}
{"text":"Meh Bad red sangria. I'm an amateur and my home made sangria is so much better with more flavour.  The Blood Orange Bellini is alright.  The pasta is not good. I had the pesto fettuccine and it tastes like those Sidekicks packs you just heat up.  Of course after having a plate of pasta you feel full. But an hour later, I feel sick and starting to feel hungry again.  It's definitely not an Italian restaurant, but caker style I guess.  And $12 for a slice of cheesecake? Ma...va...you know the rest.  See ya!  Not going back"}
{"text":"food was pretty good but overpriced for the portion, the dessert was terrible and overpriced lol this place is really overpriced tbh if you go here don't get a dessert it tastes terrible and will only rack up your bill; waitress was sassy"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Our server, Mary, was super welcoming and very knowledgeable of the menu items. The food was great, especially the MOZZARELLA!!! Get it, you won't be disappointed. Also, you get your money's worth on the cocktails!"}
{"text":"I checked out their Vaughan location recently and was excited to try their food since it was my first time.   The food was good but the service was terrible (except for the front hostess). It took 10 minutes for someone to come and take our order so I had to call over a random server who seemed extremely annoyed and was giving attitude. Don't work as a waiter if you can't communicate professionally with customers, you're better off washing the dishes.   Our actual server came around after we ordered with the other guy and he asked if we needed anything else. We even had problems with our server, as he wasn't attentive and I had to wait a long time to flag him down. Keep in mind there were barely any customers, two other tables to be exact.   When it was time to get the bill, I had to wait another 10 minutes to call him over in which he walked past me sticking up his index finger saying \"hold on\". Haha wow, extremely unprofessional. I'm assuming this Scaddabush location likes hiring ignorant people who have attitude and lack any customer service.   What a shame. It's not like the food was amazing for someone to go back. This restaurant will never succeed with this kind of service."}
{"text":"Visited this location again. We came here on a Wednesday night and the dining room was not busy at all. We were seated quickly in one of the booths. Our server was nice. However, the surrounding tables had a bunch of plates and cups that still hasn't been taken care of. It was actually still there once we paid for our bill.   I got to try the Green Sangria and it was a little too sour for my liking. I'd give it a 3/5. I also got to try their Gnocchi Gorgonzola. Sauce was creamy. Mushrooms and carmelized onions were a nice touch. Lots of garlic cloves and decent amount of arugula. I personally wasn't a fan of the dish mostly because of the Gorgonzola sauce so I'd give it a 2/5 but my boyfriend thought the dish tasted okay. We also shared the Chicken Parmesan Bites and we really enjoyed them! I wish the portion was bigger. The Parmesan aïoli was the perfect sauce to pair it with. 5/5 for that one. I finally got to order my Zucca Ravioli and unfortunately it was dry.. there was no sauce at all. You can even see the difference between my picture and a fellow yelper's picture. So it's a 4/5."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Friday, it was busy but we didn't have to wait.  The servers were very friendly and helped select the dishes. The food looked good and it was tasting very fresh. The meatball was a bit salty but other than that, we liked it.  There is a lot of variety for meals and drinks. The lemonade with a dash of mint was really good."}
{"text":"My experience here was off to a rocky start. They couldn't find my reservation so my experience started off like this:  Hostess: I can't find your reservation, is it under another name? Me: Nope Hostess: Are you sure you made it for the right location Me: (Checks phone log)....yup Hostess: Ok, well I can't find it Me: So, do you have space for my party Hostess: Not really Me: Ok, so should I leave or....  Luckily a manager stepped in and got us a table.  That aside, Scaddabush belongs to the SIR Corp family of restaurants (Jack Astors, Alice Fazzoli's, etc.). Given this, I didn't expect much from the meal - can you blame me for questioning if the guys behind Jack Astors can deliver quality Italian food? But I have to admit, my expectations were exceeded.  The fresh mozzarella was heavenly. The meatball was delicious and tender, however, I'd pass on it next time since I can't justify spending $13 on just one (big) meatball. The penne bolognese, while not authentic, is savoury and flavourful.   The presentation of their desserts, however, could use some work. Wasn't a big fan of the panettone bread pudding, but their tiramisu was decent."}
{"text":"They won't seat you until 80% of your party has arrived, even when the restaurant is completely empty on a Tuesday evening. Weird arbitrary policy. Front staff need the autonomy to make decisions as to when (if ever) this policy makes sense.  They also charge extra for bread and try to 'upsell' you when you order pasta. The server doesn't mention that it's extra $$."}
{"text":"Came here Tuesday night for a birthday and can say it is nothing special. Was excited about the zuca ravioli as I enjoy a butternut squash ravioli, and I enjoyed the taste, but wish it had more sauce, as there was hardly any on my pasta. I ordered a small (8 pcs) vs the regular (12 pcs) after asking the waitress which she though was ideal. The portion appeared a bit small but was good for me as someone who gets full quickly. I would recommend a larger size if you want a heartier meal or are sharing though. Food was decent, pasta also could have been a bit softer, my friend ordered penne which looked also a bit weird and had hardly any sauce. A bit disappointing that there is no bread for the table or any good desserts, so probably won't be coming back often."}
{"text":"Great gluten free choices. Fresh and delicious food. Great service. My daughter loved her kids meal, which came with a make-your-own ice cream sundae."}
{"text":"I brought my wife and kids for dinner.  First time since they opened.  Was a busy Tuesday evening last night. It was a 20 minute wait for a table.  They have a texting service for when your table is ready.  We got our appetizers and kids meals fairly quickly.  Small ceasar salad and calamari, both of which were standard and nothing special but edible. Kids got pasta with tomatoe sauce which was dry and didn't have enough sauce (so it wasn't eaten), and chicken strips which were burnt with fries, which literally made my sin throw up.  Then it took another 30 minutes before our mains arrived.  My wife had the Italian burger which was decent, and I had their spiral pasta with tomatoe sauce.  I asked for mushrooms in it, which apparently is a lot to ask for.  Mushrooms were completely raw.  So I sent it back... It comes back (same dish mind you even though the server said she would have a new one prepared) and the mushrooms are still raw.  A chef who doesn't know how to add mushrooms to a dish or cook them even after being sent back?  Lol... Yeah we won't be returning here.  The table beside us also had issues with their pasta.  Manager was nice to comp them coffee/espresso, and he comped our mains... But I didn't want it comped, I wanted to have my dinner.  I sent it back second time and we left. So to chalk it all up.... Horrible service due to wait times, and absolutely horrible food!!!"}
{"text":"Arrived early for supper, around 5. The place was fairly empty. It still took our waitress over 15 minutes to get our drink orders. The service did not improve from there. 30 minute wait with empty plates in front of us. The food was good however the portions were small. I found the location in Richmond Hill much better. Will mot be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor but that doesn't make up for the horrible service and the overpriced wanna be Italian food.  I live in Woodbridge and this does not compare to the family run Italian restaurants that know how to make a proper spaghetti and meatballs.  The pizza was like bruschetta ...disappointing. Sooooo expensive for what the food was. The patio is small and nothing special. I will not be going back here."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a couple of appetizers last Sunday. The server was nice. We wanted to order the avocado bruschetta and the i think it was spinach dip? But there was no more dip (this was around 930pm). We then ordered some fried dish which didn't taste so good and we didn't end up eating it so the server took it off of our bill which was nice. We were really happy with the bruschetta though! I could have gone for another round of it."}
