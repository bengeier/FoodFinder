{"text":"Love this place! The place is clean...the staff are friendly and helpful. And the Smoothies are great... especially the Protein Packer."}
{"text":"I love this place!  They are always friendly - always get great service!  And their smoothies are great too.  I enjoy picking one up when I'm in a hurry and don't have time to eat lunch and have to do shopping.  Wonderful addition to Parma - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Come here at least once or twice a week after MMA training, always order the usual matcha match with their chicken ceasar wrap in spinach, super good can't complain, friendly staff and very fast on orders. Definitely a good spot to go to after a hard workout 5 thumbs up."}
{"text":"Love this place , friendly help. Smoothies are great. Peanut butter granola wrap is great. I wish they had a drive thru like Kent, but oh well. Love it!"}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED  I love this place!! The girls who work here are so nice! I went here for the first time last night after Fitworks. The smoothies are cheaper and really delicious! It's really clean and nice and bright inside. It was the perfect pick-me-up after my workout.  I got the protein packer smoothie which was chocolate and peanut butter and overall delicious-ness packed inside. I can't wait to try a veggie juice next time!"}
{"text":"This place is just like any pulp I've been to.  So happy that they finally have a store at this location so I don't have to drive to Kent anymore just to get their delicious smoothies.  The only reason why I knocked off one star is because the taste of every smoothie is not consistent.  I always get one smoothie in particular and it always tastes different.  When I went to Kent's Pulp, my smoothie tasted the same every time no matter who made it.  Here my smoothie is either too watery or just right.  I'll still come here despite the fact because I believe these young girls can make it happen one of these days!"}
{"text":"One of my reoccurring weekend treats. My Boyfriend and I love going on Sunday's for a smoothie and he always gets a salad and I get a wrap. Nothing ever disappoints. The portion sizes are not huge so if you are going for something filling order a smoothie and food item. We recommend the Strawberry Extreme. But I've tried others and all of the fruit smoothies have been delicious. I prefer them to include yogurt so the sherbet taste isn't too overpowering."}
{"text":"I have been here twice.  Both times the staff was super friendly and helpful!  The pina colada smoothie is absolutely delicious!!! Looking forward to trying other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Drinks are always perfect and if you don't like something, they're happy to make you something new! Always friendly staff as well! I don't think I've ever walked inside and not been greeted. Two thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"Delicious smoothies and even the wraps are good too!  It's a little pricey, but so worth it and they also frequently send out coupons."}
{"text":"Great Service! The girls are really nice and work fast. This pulp location is also immaculate. Everything is super clean. I order wheatgrass everyday and for whatever reason the wheatgrass at this location is better than the Strongsville location. Pulp is way better than robeks. Bigger servings, better wheatgrass, better everything."}
