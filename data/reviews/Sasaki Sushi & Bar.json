{"text":"Wonderful Sushi.  In the last 2 weeks I have eaten there eight times. Fresh delish. Couldn't recommend it high enough. A little difficult to find but well worth the effort. I am vegan and they gladly adapted items for me."}
{"text":"The patio is a great way to unwind after work, especially with their custom made drinks. Their traditional sushi is amazing and the signature rolls are like works of art."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS FOOD!!...my girlfriend and I love sushi so we are always trying different restaurants but it looks like we have found our new go to spot. Hands down better then a lot of big name sushi chains. If you are looking for super fresh food and beautiful dish presentations with a chill atmosphere this place is a must. KEEP THE GOOD FOOD COMING SASAKI!!!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Scottsdale Olde Towne and decided to look for lunch off the main touristy area.  It was by a happy accident that we found Sasaki Sushi Bar tucked in a pedestrian mall area. We were warmly greeted by the staff and told that they had just recently opened and we decided to give this place a try. We are so happy that we did.  Beautifully decorated both inside and out, great food and attentive staff.  We ordered two different poke bowls that were delicious and fresh with just the right amount for lunch.  Don't hesitate to give this place a try--wish we lived closer so we could go again. Don't forget to try the warm sak√©."}
{"text":"Decided to come here based off the good reviews. The waiter said it was their first full week being open, so understandably they might be working out some kinks. The biggest complaint we had was the music. It was hard core EDM that was being played way too loud for a dinner restaurant. It was overwhelming. Our first sushi roll was amazing! Highly recommend that roll, the Sasaki roll. However our other two rolls did not meet our expectations. See the picture, the ends of the California roll were lacking. The salmon roll tasted fishy, more than most salmon rolls I've had."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!!! This place is incredible! The inside is absolutely breathtaking, with an atmosphere that makes you feel like you are at home. The staff is very attentive and welcoming and don't get me started on the food. The food is so exquisite, with a taste so fresh and delicious that it melts your mouth. We have tried countless sushi restaurants, but this does not compare. You can tell that they truly make everything from scratch. I love this place!  Come and try SASAKI SUSHI & BAR, it is the place to be!!!"}
{"text":"The Tropi Jessy poki bowl. It was fresh and delicious, as was the Samurai roll.    Great friendly service"}
{"text":"The best sushi experience I've ever had! If you like sushi you will LOVE Sasaki Sushi.  Not only was the sushi excellent quality, the flavor combinations of all of the rolls were extraordinary!  The presentation of each plate was beautiful.  Is says a lot about a restaurant when you feel like a special guest the very first visit!  The talent of the chef is out of this world.  The restaurant has only been opened for a few months.  I have a feeling they are going to be around a long time!  We definitely will be back! My only negative is that Sasaki Sushi is not in my home town."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have a found a sushi restaurant that not only has amazing food but also has a great atmosphere! I would highly suggest this restaurant for Lunch meetings, happy hour, date night or a family dinner! I know I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great new sushi place tucked away next to AZ 88 and the Scottsdale contemporary art museum. Staff was friendly and the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"This place takes way too long for food to come out. I finished my water before any food could come out. It took them 5 minutes just to bring some eel sauce and spicy mayo. The food was decent nothing special, the fried calamari was soggy because of the grease. The place wasn't even holding 3 tables and took so long for the food to come out."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, great customer service, great quality of food. The ambiance is amazing"}
{"text":"With so many sushi options in Scottsdale, it's hard to set your place apart, but the new Sasaki in Old Town manages to do that. We were in town for spring training and noticed the new place next to the Blue Moose and gave it a try. Right away the staff made us feel welcome.   Our server, Monica was kind and accommodating, the sushi was fresh with some unique and fun presentations. Sasaki made a great first impression, so much so that we went back again at the end of our trip.   On our 2nd visit we got to meet chef and owner Neil as well. They serve traditional sushi as well sone inventive alternatives and rolls. Hamachi sashimi was excellent. Also liked the Phoenix roll.   Ask for a table outside, the atmosphere out there relaxed and romantic. And even when we arrived just prior to closing time, we were never made to feel rushed. We will be back for sure next time we're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was OK.  No Happy Hour drink specials.    Ordered a Corona and it came without a lime.   Waiter said \"I usually like my Corona's with limes\" and then brought us out an entire lime sliced up.   Odd.  Food delicious but slow with nobody else there.   Presentation was great however.  Something is missing there and they need to figure it out quick with prime/busy only season weeks away."}
{"text":"I really liked the location, music, service, and food! I lived in Japan for a year, and this place will definitely be in my rotation."}
{"text":"Sasaki Sushi & Bar is definitely my favorite go to place for dinner and even a quick bite. The food is fresh and the service is exceptional. The owner, Monica, is one of the most sweetest, attentive individuals that I have ever encountered. I have sat both inside and outside and the scenery is great! I highly recommend the Poki bowls as well as the different drinks that the bar provides. Out of all the sushi places that I have tried, this is one of my favorites in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. Food was great, fish was fresh and clean. The staff was super friendly and the Kirin was cold!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place has amazing poke. It's soooo fresh and like butter in your mouth!! I tried the Sasaki poke bowl and I felt just so happy all over and loving life. I can't wait to go back and try some of their other poke bowls. The staff is so friendly. The hostess is such a sweetheart and the chef was letting me sample some of his experimental creations. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We are from Minnesota.  We were in the mood for sushi. Found Sasaki sushi & Bar. A great find.  Food and sushi is fresh and veery well made.  This is a must go if your in old town Scottsdale.  Don't get frustrated when it takes a little time to find it.  It's worth it.   My wife stated that the Sasaki such I roll is the best thing she has ever had  I can't argue with her statement.   Very very good.    Come here if in AZ Scottsdale"}
{"text":"From reading other reviews, I can tell that this restaurant is either a hit or miss. Unfortunately, my family's experience here was a miss. For sure.   This place is unbelievably hard to find, but once we did we were pleasantly surprised with how cute the patio was and decided to sit in one of the outdoor booths. We were the only table on the patio, and I believe there was one or two tables inside. I asked our waiter about what came inside some of their rolls, as it's not on the menu, and she had to run off and ask the sushi chef about every single one. I understand she's relatively new, but you could have easily written it down rather than going back and forth to the bar. We finally order, all of us excited as we have seen the pictures on their website and Yelp and believe we should be in for a treat as far as presentation. 40 minutes later, our food comes out and it is nothing to shake a stick at. I've seen fire and ice sculptures in their pictures, we got none of it. Our rolls almost looked thrown onto the plate along with a few edible flowers. When i questioned the waitress and mentioned what other customers have gotten, she said the presentation depended on the \"mood\" of the sushi chef for the day. Um? He's grumpy, so we get subpar service? Yeah, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Very fresh fish in the delicious sushi rolls and nice atmosphere.  Also great happy hour on Sundays.  The staff was very friendly, the sushi chef even made us a custom sushi roll with all our favorites.  We will definitely  be back to support this great new business."}
{"text":"Great sushi for a good price. The servers are always very friendly and make it a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"the sushi here is so yummy and fresh. really nice, relaxing atmosphere enjoyable for all ages. great choices of alcoholic and non drinks! service is humble and enjoyable, would highly reccomend if looking for sushi in the area!! give your service somewhere deserved."}
{"text":"Service is good & the food is good. Beer is cold and the saki is hot!  Love the patio. Great place to hang out on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"HOLY WOW!! There are no words. This place is absolutely amazing- hands down best sushi place I've been to in all of Arizona. The ambiance is great, music is good and service is wonderful. My server was Monica who is an absolute gem. She was so nice and knowledgeable on the questions i asked her about the rolls. I ordered the tuna tataki followed by the super volcano roll and the mochi for dessert! Everything that the chef made blew my mind, the flavor and presentation were unbeatable!! I will definitely be back and will be telling everyone I know to come here!"}
{"text":"We got take-out from here and it was just okay.  We had:   Cucumber Sunomono - which was really good Phoenix Roll (Sasaki Signature Roll)- just okay Samurai Roll (No Rice Roll) - just okay- fish was chewy Super Volcano Roll (Baked Roll) - also just okay.  Not really a lot of crab mix on top which is our favorite part of a volcano roll.   We are bummed - we were hoping for a new yummy sushi place."}
{"text":"Had some happy hour nigiri sushi and was very impressed with the quality of the fish, presentation and the service was excellent. I'd definitely return again and found the prices to be very reasonable, especially on the happy hour items. Portions were large too!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Excellent service. An elegant privately owned sushi restaurant with where the pride in ownership is prevelant."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Such a fun lunch in a relaxing atmosphere. Very fresh sashimi!!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to hear about this sushi place within walking distance of where we lived. We have been looking for a new sushi place to try out and cannot wait to come back here! The fish was incredibly fresh and all the rolls we ordered were AMAZING. Our server, Monica, gave us outstanding service and was very attentive! They were also very understanding about us having our dog with us on the patio, and even brought him water. If you have a chance to visit Sasaki you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The sushi rolls were delicious and creative. Had the Godzilla Roll and Golden Dragon Roll. The coolest part was having one of the rolls inside an ice sculpture. Very innovative. Just ask and they can do the same for you. Sushi presentations were very well executed and thought out. Flavor combinations were unique and refreshing. The Cherry Blossom wall mural was beautiful. Customer service was excellent and staff were attentive. The chef created a special dessert for us and it was amazing! Patio seating available and added to the overall chic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Close to perfection. Outdoor dining in a private, open-air booth felt relaxed and intimate. We ordered the tuna tataki appetizer at the waiter's gentle recommendation, and it was both delicious and gorgeously prepared. I ordered the shirashi bowl and ikura and my husband had the sasaki poke bowl with some nigiri tuna and eel.   I have never tasted fresher fish, particularly the most beautiful salmon I have ever seen--and that's saying a lot because I'm Alaskan. The combination of taste, quality, plating, ambience, and friendly, skilled service would be enough to earn five stars...the fact that the check was only $73 ensured we could leave a generous tip.  Check out the map of the location if you are unfamiliar with the Old Town mall area. It's by The Clayton near the Center for the Performing Arts, so plan for a leisurely post-meal stroll. Most highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant located in the shopping plaza. Very kind and attentive hosts and bartenders. Food was very good. Original drink option wasn't available but they made a comparable substitution. Definitely a return to location."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I aren't from AZ but we were super excited to eat here based on the menu. We had to go to a show later that evening and told the server we needed to leave at 7. (We had arrived around 6:15) The restaurant wasn't very busy at all with it being Sunday and she said that shouldn't be a problem. We ordered pretty quickly and got our appetizers in a timely manner. Around 6:30, one of the servers came by and said that a machine was broken but it shouldn't be too much longer. 6:50 comes and we still hadn't received our rolls. We stopped one of the waiters who said she'd go check on our sushi. She came back and said that our rolls hadn't even been started. We had been waiting for over 30 minutes. 3 of our rolls got rushed out and we asked them to bring the bill. 7:00 came and we needed to leave. No one had brought our check to us so one of my friends had to go up the the bar to request our checks. They had trouble splitting the bill and asked my friend to do the math for them... they did send us with two rolls and didn't make us pay for one of the rolls but neither of the two rolls were what we had ordered for our 4th. This is the worst service I have ever received from a restaurant and we were very frustrated and disappointed."}
{"text":"I am so excited for Sasaki Sushi & Bar to be open directly across from my work. My co-worker and I went in for lunch to-go. The service was great! The crew was so nice   And the food was fresh and great! We are planning are sushi Wednesday's! If you are in Old Town Scottsdale for a show, hanging out in the civic center park, or any event, they are a quick, fresh, place to check out! Plus the prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Amazing Sushi and Service, highly recommended.  We've been all over Scottsdale getting sushi and this place blew us away"}
{"text":"Great Sushi restaurant! Prompt and attentive service. The quality of the fish and presentation was top notch. The cute little orange desert will keep me coming back it was so tasty. I'd easily pick this place over any other sushi bar in old town."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi and sashimi I have ever had locally.  I stopped eating sushi for a while because it tastes the same wherever I go. Even higher-end places. At Sasaki, each piece of fish tastes distinct and fresh. The presentation is exceptional.  The poke is fresh with abundant fishes and I love the fresh cucumber and shredded radish they serve. BEST eel ever!!!  Monica owns and operates Sasaki - she takes her ownership very seriously and it shows!"}
{"text":"I was excited to hear about another Japanese restaurant close to home but was disappointed to find out that it is less than great.   Great ambiance and location but the service and food is subpar.   We tried to order off the cold sake list and were told by our waitress that all of the sake comes with beer regardless of if it's listed under sake bomb or not. We just wanted an order of sake...The waitress later corrected herself after she sensed our confusion.  We ordered a handroll, a regular roll, and a Poke bowl (spelled \"Poki\" on the menu) and the order came out incorrectly and poorly made. The fish was chewy and seemed unfresh as well."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi spots I've ever been too. Absolutely delicious! And Monica provided the best service I've ever experienced from a server in my adult life... and I'm almost 50."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Outdoor seats are nice especially 2 seats are really nice especially for couples will be romantic hehe. Rolls, sushi and sashimi was really fresh. And hostess is really polite cute girl. I really loved here"}
{"text":"The server was super nice and everything, but there was only one couple other than us and the service took forever! The food was okay but no one was there and it was so slow. Will not be returning unfortunately :("}
{"text":"Ate here for the first and last time tonight. I'm not much of a review-writer, but we had such a disappointing experience at this restaurant tonight  I had to share my honest opinion with you. My husband and I show up for a bite and a drink during Friday night happy hour prior to a show at the Arts center. When we arrived there were only 3 tables with people at them, and we put our orders in quickly. Then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. About an hour later we finally received our first roll (a simple vegetable roll, nonetheless) and the one piece of tempura inside it was cold, limp, and soggy. About 15 Mins later we got our other dish. We noticed other tables weren't receiving much food, and people were definitely looking restless. By that time there were 8 tables total with people seated - more than when we started, but certainly not overwhelming. Meanwhile, there was only one sushi chef, one waiter/bartender, and one short order cook in the back who was doubling as a waiter. We -of course- never got a refill on water, had to ask twice or three times for everything, and the food was mediocre at best. My husband finally got up to pay at the bar instead of trying to wait to flag down the poor waiter. It was, of course, not the waiter's fault. The place got hit with a bigger crowd (8 tables) than they expected. But it's Friday night. In Scottsdale. Next to a busy theater and gallery. This place advertises its happy hour all over its website and yelp. They obviously don't expect more than a few tables to show up, because they aren't prepared for more than that. It definitely made us question the freshness and quality of the food - if your restaurant is only expecting a couple of tables on a Friday night, how much fresh food are you stocking? I fear, by the taste of everything, not much. Save yourself a few hours of listening to blaring techno music while you wait for bad food and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Verrryyyy slow service. Under staffed and took close to an hour to get our food. We also didn't get our food all at once so weren't able to eat together. Food was decent but took way longer than it should've... some took 15 min and some took an hour... and it was not a busy night."}
{"text":"New sushi place, I had dinner with my friend tonight. There was a party here, so it takes a bit more time than usual to get the food, but the food is great, very fresh and tasty. I'd recommend lettuce wrap as the appetizer. WORTH TO WAIT."}
{"text":"I went for a late bite to eat with a friend. The place is cute and MY service was awesome, however my friend I was dining with service was a 3 star according to her. We placed our orders at the same time ALL of my food came on time and was delicious. Her food was delivered after mine 45mins after my food arrived. She order a cocktail with olives was told they didn't have any. All in all I enjoyed my experience she was from Tuscon and wanted to walk out. Also one note down a little extra on quality napkins. Can't say I'd return since it was over 30mins from where I live. My food was the first three photos hers are the last three."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that we found this hidden gem in Old Town Scottsdale. The prices are much more realistic compared to the other sushi restaurants around. Skyler was such a fun bartender/server. He went out of our way to even ask they chef to make us some chili spiced edamame, instead of the plain (and it's the best we have ever had). Thank you and your amazing staff for introducing us to our new spot!"}
{"text":"Food is fine, pretty standard sushi, but the service was absolutely terrible. I'm pretty sure our server was the only person working, there was maybe 4 other people there the entire time we were in the restaurant (on a Saturday night), and it took us over 2 hours to receive the food we'd ordered. It took us an hour and a half to get waters for our group of 12. Again, there were maybe 4 other people in the restaurant, and they were overheard complaining as well. We had to go inside multiple times to ask for things/where things were. There's no excuse for the poor service. I WILL NOT come back."}
{"text":"Prologue: My fiancee and I were attending a performance at the Scottsdale Center for the Performing Arts and we were looking for a nice place to have dinner before the show. We came upon this new sushi restaurant while strolling around near the Center and decided to give it a try.   The Plot: We started by sharing an order of Fried Calamari (those of you who have read some of our previous reviews are well aware that I am virtually incapable of passing up an opportunity to order this starter). That was followed by a Golden Dragon Roll and the Sasaki Poki Bowl. We also enjoyed a complimentary Calamari Salad (more about that below).   The Scene: The portion sizes for all of the items we ordered were decent and more than enough for the two of us to share.  The Fried Calamari rings were plump, tender, juicy, and delicious. During this course my fiancee and I discussed the fact that the term 'calamari' is often used as a generic term for squid on restaurant menus. In reality, of course, the term 'calamari' refers to one just specific species from among over 500 species of squid. Judging by the diameter and thickness of the rings we were served, this was undoubtedly a species other than calamari; however the dish was, never the less, very yummy.  The Golden Dragon Roll was perhaps the most artistically presented sushi roll we've ever ordered (see Billie's photo below). Although I agree with the general concern shared by some chefs and gourmands regarding inedible garnishes, in this case I was more than willing to set aside any such concern and simply enjoy the experience. There was a lot going on in the roll itself as well. Often times when a sushi roll is this complex, the flavor of the fish tends to get somewhat drowned out. However, in this case, the flavor of the fish still came through, was fresh, light, and balanced well with the flavors of the other ingredients.  Our experience with the Sasaki Poki Bowl was very similar to the Golden Dragon Roll in that the flavor of the fish was fresh and light without being overpowered by the other flavors. This dish also reminded me of the Poke Tuna Salad we tried at Ramen Dozo (see our review from 11/29/17). My preference for poke, as a result, has now transitioned to this type of dish because of the relatively lighter flavors, as compared to the stronger citrus and pepper flavors of traditional poke.  My fiancee was, for the most part, unfamiliar with squid salad prior to this meal. She is now most certainly a fan and has ordered it again on a couple of occasions since The presentation was delightful and the portion size was relatively generous.   The Rest of the Story: The service was very friendly, however the wait for our entrees was somewhat excessive. Recognizing this, the chef at the sushi bar sent a complimentary, and quite yummy, squid salad to our table, which was much appreciated.  The prices were a little higher than we normally pay at sushi restaurants; however given the location this was to be expected and the difference was by no means exorbitant.   Epilogue: The convenience of this location and the quality of the food alone deserved 3 stars. We might have decided against awarding another star due to the long wait for our entrees, however the chef succeeded in making it up to us with the complimentary appetizer. I expect this will become a regular dining spot for us when attending future performances at the Center for the Performing  Arts.   Photo Design: by Billie Z."}
{"text":"Hands down the freshest sushi I've had since I was in Japan. Even the ginger is notably crisper and more fresh than anywhere else in town. I'm going to dream about the buttery goodness of the salmon nagiri all night. Everything about this place makes me happy. The staff is amazing and it's beautiful inside. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Great service and even better food. This is a must try if you like sushi & elegance. I will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Excited to try a new sushi place in Old Town as we've found the others in the area are either super expensive or not the freshest. This place did not disappoint! It was still on the pricier end, but the sushi and poke bowls were so fresh and tasty! We ordered the Ekolu Roll to share and poke bowls. The roll was very good and came on an giant ice tray decorated with flowers. I got the Sasaki poke bowl and it was huge, definitely had leftovers for the next day's lunch! My boyfriend got the Ne poke bowl and was warned that the sauce was very spicy so he got it on the side. However, we both tasted it and it was barely a blip on the spice-meter so they must have toned it down. Both bowl were very fresh and we definitely ate way too much.   I will also give the team there kudos for working to improve their business. All the not-so-stellar reviews had to do with the food taking forever to come out. There were about 4-5 other tables when we sat down so our roll did take quite a while (I'm guessing it was the elaborately decorated ice trays that take the most time...). Our servers were very apologetic and gave us 10% off our bill for the wait and the rest of the food came out quickly once we finished our roll.   A cute new sushi place definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE sushi place. The ambiance is great and the food is even better. Chief Juan never fails to impress. He puts time into everything he makes and the plate presentation is nothing like I've ever seen.  This is such a great restaurant to impress someone with.  Overall, this place is a gem."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for reverse happy hour (after 9:00 pm). Skyler was our server. He was awesome! The sushi was outstanding as well. We will most definitely be back! Thanks so much."}
{"text":"Little bit pricy and slow service despite us being the only customers in the restaurant. Also, 99% sure I left my credit card at the restaurant, and when I called to retrieve it a few hours later the employees had no idea what I was referring to.  Per your comment: I have a $78 charge on my credit card from Feb 12th. My boyfriend went to retrieve my credit card and you did not have it. I do live out of AZ so I had to replace my card. It's totally fine but I was a customer there so I'm not sure why your records show otherwise. Perhaps time to organize a bit."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy their speciality cocktails (which are all interesting, complex, and feature real ingredients) and enjoy the multitude of delicious menu items they have available. I had the takaki which was amazing (pictured) and I could not have been happier with it both presentation and tastewise. My lunch companion got the  tonkotsu ramen and it was beyond delicious, and again such a wonderful visual presentation. I got two sushi rolls which were amazing (Rock & Roll and the Pacific Roll). This is my new favorite place. I will be bringing everybody I know for my future lunch and dinner endeavors. They even packed my sushi in a takeout package for me!!"}
{"text":"What a great find. My daughter ate here and we had to come. The freshest fish I've had.  Friendly service and a relaxing vibe."}
{"text":"Two stars because the food was really good, but honestly the service was so terrible that I would not go back. To give our server some credit, it was her first day, but the server supervising her did nothing to help with several mistakes. It took over 2 hours for us to get sushi rolls, and they completely forgot one person's order (first drink, then sushi) and did not bring her food out until almost 15 minutes after everyone else's after being asked two times. They never really apologized for forgetting her food, and the entire experience was extremely slow and frustrating"}
{"text":"My new favorite sushi spot in Scottsdale! The nicest service, fresh fish and great location. Perfect spot to sit outside during the cooler months. Really can't say enough nice things about the place."}
{"text":"Found this on yelp and am so glad we did. Has a cool Japesese decor. VERY attentive staff who gave some good suggestions for drinks and food . Food was fresh and flavorful. Will definitely be back and speaking of....they are taking reservations for Thanksgiving and black Friday."}
{"text":"Pretty good I guess. If we go down straight to the quality of the sushi and the freshness of the fish: it probably won't make it to the top my list as \"best sushi in town\" but I would gladly return a second time.  I had a order to go on a Monday for lunch so I can't speak for the service. However, Matthew at the front desk was very welcoming and accommodating in answering my questions and taking my order. I had a Philadelphia roll, a salmon nigiri and a spicy tuna roll. Salmon was really good, spicy tuna so so. I'd be curious to try other items on the menu next time. This place is new and located right on the West side of Cool Gelato in Old Town Scottsdale. If you're driving you're not gonna see it, so plan on parking your car somewhere nearby. Prices are decent. Staff was nice. I'll return."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sushi restaurants in Scottsdale. Tucked away off a grassy promenade steps away from the Scottsdale theater of performing arts, Sasaki is definitely a hidden gem. The happy hour deals are excellent, I highly recommend the tuna avocado roll ($5 during happy hour) and a sake bomb ($7 during happy hour, with a wide selection of beer). Both of the owners are attentive to every guest and place the customer experience above all else, actively working to expand the menu and bring more delicious options to the guests. I would also recommend the rainbow roll, which has a lovely presentation. All of the sushi is fresh and has a crisp clean taste that is hard to explain but is exactly what you are looking for when you are craving sushi. For dessert they offer an exquisitely refreshing dish which is essentially an orange with honey, again bringing a crisp clean taste to round out the meal. I've been to Sasaki at least once a week and will continue to do so while I'm in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"We chose this place as it was kind of hidden at the Old Town Scottsdale, since we wanted piece and quiet. We waited quite a bit, but once the food came it was amazing. They really tried hard on presentation and it really looked good. Sushi on fire, sushi on ice....Sushi was fresh and it tasted good too. Staff was nice and welcoming. We were there with kids, so it was nice that kids could play too and we didn't have to worry about them as the place is not at the epicenter of the nightlife but you can still enjoy being at the park. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wowza! Stumbled upon this new spot last weekend and decided to come check it out this wknd. Man, this is our new go-to for sushi in Old Town!   Ambience - super nice, clean, and they have both indoor and outdoor patio seating. Decorative pink flower blossoms on the ceiling and a cool scenic mural on the back wall.   Service - outstanding! We were the only customers until right before we left when another couple dined in. The three employees were all very attentive and went out of their way to ensure we had a great dining experience.   Food - superb! I ordered a hot green tea and it was made fresh and had some sort of wonderful flavoring. It was probably the best green tea I've ever had at an Asian restaurant. The miso soup was warm and comforting. Crab rangoon appetizer was made with fresh crabmeat/cream cheese and the dipping sauce was flavorful. For sushi, we tried a Shrimp Tempura Roll and the Godzilla Roll. Both were excellent! We had every intention to order more but both rolls were so massive we were completely stuffed!   The sushi chef gave us a sample of his specialty pickled, spiced jalape√±o salad mix and it was sooo good! When I explained I was pregnant and couldn't eat any raw fish he was really understanding and said he could cook and prepare any fish the way I'd like it. He made sure to take his time and you could tell he really put some love into our dishes  Quite impressed with this spot and I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very slow service. Waited about 30 min for our Sake. They only had one chef this night. More than an hour to get our food. Disappointed in their service."}
