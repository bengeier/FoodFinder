{"text":"Best Pho Ive had in Toronto. Nice location, very friendly staff, will be visiting here often."}
{"text":"Nice place in an unassuming plaza. Also, Best Name Ever.  Polite, friendly service.  Food is reasonably priced and very tasty.  Definitely dropping by again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great Pho!
Had the veggie Pho, usually bland. Not here. 
Fresh honey lemonade. 
Great option in the area."}
{"text":"My family and I have fallen in love with this place all over again. I don't remember why we stopped or took a pause on this spot because we were missing out on all the goodies! This place prices the items fair and the portions are huge! 

My fav is the shrimp pho with clear noodles. I only order my pho with clear noodles and this place has it. There are only a few Vietnamese spots that have clear noodles. 
The tentacles are one of the tastiest I've had. I really have no complains.

The staff also get a five star from me, they are fast and helpful. They really seem to have pride in what they do and love the place!

Go get you some Hung Long"}
{"text":"They have the best Tom Yum soup ever! And their shrimp rolls with peanut sauce is ridiculously delicious! Definitely recommend this place I've been coming here for years!"}
{"text":"Large menu, free parking, reasonable portions quick hot meals, perfect rice and noodle dishes. They have spicy dishes and sauces at the table to add more. The pho noodles were perfect not overly soft and soup had decent complexity of flavors. The fresh cold spring rolls had bbq pork and shrimp. Restrooms are down stairs making it difficult for wheelchairs and seniors. Will be back to try pad thai and udon !"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed eating here and have never been disappointed. Staff are quick and polite. The food is SO GOOD. Especially for the amount you're getting and the price you're paying. So glad I stumbled across this place in my neighbourhood. The food is fresh and flavourful. It feels like a family restaurant with the open dinning room and all the people inside."}
{"text":"This place is great. Awesome value and food is cooked and served in a very fast manner. Great portions that I come here often."}
{"text":"Great food with decent portion sizes.  Came here recently with a group of 5 adults and 2 kids.  We took forever to place our order but the food came very quickly and was very fresh!  It had been awhile since I was here last and it does seem that the prices went up quite a bit from the last time I was here.  Overall though it's a decent place to get some pho."}
{"text":"An average Vietnamese restaurant, reasonable priced with good portion. I ordered the Bun bu hue noodle soup and grilled chicken pork sausage with vermicelli, both are authentic. After trying out this place, we came.across Pho Mi Asia nearby and learned than they have more yelp reviews and better rating. For sire will try this one next time."}
{"text":"Wanted pho after our Yorkdale visit and yelped this place. Yea the plaza is sketchy but the pho is worth it! We all had the traditional pho tai and the portions were great, lots of noodles and good yummy broth. Price is par with other pho places in the area and service was great - esp the young, charismatic waiter! Not a full 5 star b/c the restroom smelt bad accordingly to my kid. Will definitely be our go-to spot after a long shopping day."}
{"text":"My go-to lunch spot near work. Been here many many times. The pho is as good as it gets in Toronto. After discovering this place, I haven't been to other pho places. Service is quick and good for an Asian place. The viet coffee takes a while to come, so if you're in a rush, don't order it."}
{"text":"When I'm craving some shrimp Pad Thai, fresh rolls or chicken chow mein this is my go to restaurant. Always taste great, fresh and made in about 10-15 minutes. The menu is very long and extensive, But I just stick to what I know and always order the same things.  It's always busy, so you know it's tasty food. 
You can call ahead to place your order to save time for pick up."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of the restaurant. 

The bathroom was pretty gross, it smelt like moth balls, I wanted to throw up. 

The food was OK, nothing to write home about. I usually love Vietnamese, I'll find somewhere better."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Viet restaurant! I usually get there seafood green curry with rice and it always exceeds. They definitely don't cheap out as I never finish my dish because I am always given quite a big portion and loaded with various seafood
I always end up saving the rest for later. I am never disappointed as the curry sauce boosts of aromatic flavour and its seafoods itself are cooked evenly. 

My boyfriend always gets Pho every time, and he and I agree that the broth is Delicious! I have worked at couple of Viet restaurants before and never really cared for pho anymore but this broth is definitely one of the best ones! 

I also tried their Pad Thai, to appeased my Thai craving, now this is a Vietnamese restaurant and I don't expect it compare at all Sukho Thai quality but compared to most chinese/Vietnamese owned restaurants Pad Thai's this is one isn't horrible and you get a big portion as well.

This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Used to be better than Pho Mi Asia which is in the plaza on the other side of Keele... Then they got new management and the quality of the meat in the Pho seemed to get more fatty... I will have to try this place a few more times before I make a final judgment."}
{"text":"This changed my whole understanding of Pho!

They made the broth catered to my taste as I asked for it spicy, there was also a little bit of a sour taste and it blended in perfectly. I used to order Bon Bo Hue before as regular pho didnt cut it. However the oyster and fishy taste would overcome the meaty broth. The soup at Pho Hung Long is phenomenal.

Other then the Pho- they have a very extensive menu with a vary of appetizers and mains. I was fascinated with the crispy noodle bowl that comes with the meat and vegetables in the middle. I guess the difference choices would be the T2 section (Mi Don)- crispy chow mein.
Had to wait a while as the black bean sauce softened up the noodles to make the center soft and chewt while the exterior was crispy. Was fun to eat.

The service staff are very knowledgeable and understood the demographic they were serving very well.

Went with a group of people and they all agreed; probably the best pho they ever had."}
{"text":"Tee hee hee.. and the beef balls and rare meat was pretty good too.

In all seriousness, it was very good Pho!  One of the tastier soups in the city.  It's a bit of a hidden gem dive."}
{"text":"Do not go up to the counter to pay... Ask to see the bill!  Twice we got overcharged.  First time I thought it was a mistake but second time seems sketchy.  While eating, I overheard someone else saying they were overcharged too."}
{"text":"My new go-to place for pho.  I always order the well done cooked beef with chicken.  I love how they have 3 different options for spicy: hot pepper oil, hot sauce and chopped hot peppers that I think might be Jamaican but I'm not sure.  

Staff is always friendly and hot sauce is always plentiful.  Decently priced as well.  Conveniently located near my workplace."}
{"text":"So the first 5 visits would have given this place a 3-4 star. but for what you get, plus their recent price hike - perhaps it's no longer worth it. 

Let's be honest, pho is not difficult to mass-produce. Which is why within 3 mins of your order, you often get the big bowl of it in front of you real fast. Soup is pre-made, and noodles you can buy for very little cost. However the most recent trip i made there i realized that the menu was new, food the same, but every dish was as least 1-4 dollars more than a month ago. If they do it for certain dishes, smaller increments, or put more meats in the soup, I'd be ok with it... but no, my bill in the end was 30% more than the usual rate for ordering the exact same things. 

Sorry Hung Long. I thought you had it going on. this kind of price hike is not welcomed. I'll look for a new pho shop."}
{"text":"I go here all the time since 2 years ago.. by far the best pho restaurant in this city and i know how bold this statement is...

their menu range from typical Viet dishes to some Thai and chinese dishes.
Pho is the best i have tried in close to 20 different places i have tried in Toronto/MIssissauga/Richmond hill/Markham Area.  their green curry is fantastic, and their egg noodle soup with chicken broth (forgot the viet name for it) also great choice.  I tried many different dishes here over the last 2 years and i have yet to be disappointed, not to mention how great certain dishes are.

Now they serve delicious chinese style lobster at a very reasonable price as well. 

If you are a pho addict like myself, this is one place you MUST try!

Pho Mi Asia, Chu Chu Train, Pho Dau Bo, Pho 88 and 99 aint got nothing on this place."}
{"text":"Late night eats on the cheap! That's why this place is so popular. Went here late on a Friday night and the place was busy but our party of 11 adults and 2 children were seated right away. 

We wrote our orders down on the order sheet and our food came out quickly after. I ordered the B7 Vermicelli noodles with grilled pork which came with an egg roll ($7.49). I enjoyed my dish, the vegetables were fresh and meat was flavorful with a touch of sweetness. The egg roll was a little greasy but still very tasty. I like to pour a little bit of the dipping sauce for the egg roll onto my noodle dish to add more flavor to the vermicelli. 

My hubby ordered the P18 Pho with beef, tendon and tripe ($7 for a large). I tried his soup and it was delicious (after adding the condiments of course) and the meat was tender. The balance of flavors was excellent! Servers were attentive and efficient. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very tasty! Had the pho ga (chicken) and deep fried spring rolls. Both were delicious. Prices are very reasonable and service is friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, i eat here regularly and its always to satisfaction i recommend the rare noodle soup with deep fried spring rolls!"}
{"text":"She said \"I want something hot and steamy\"
I said \"Hung Long\"
She said \"That's what I like\"
Brought her out for some Pho. She loved the place.. no shortcomings here."}
{"text":"A pivotal Pho restaurant in Toronto. Excellent broth with good noodles. The inside is run down and gummy, but it satisfies the tummy with its yummys. 

An overexcited youngster at the cash always greets and welcomes me, while the unenthusiastic servers serves me.  

The restaurant pace is relaxed and there is always someone nursing on just a single beer. 

4/5 good Pho, would return; would not be my drinking hole."}
{"text":"I discovered this restaurant by sheer luck, it is tucked in a small plaza a block west of Keele St on Wilson and I have been a devoted fan ever since.

The service is friendly, the location is very clean and spacious and the quality of the food is superb and their prices are cheap.

I highly recommed their Soup Ngo (Chicken & Sweet Corn) - the slight spice to the broth is just right!

A great place to eat well with little money :)"}
{"text":"Honestly probably the best tasting pho I've had in Toronto and I've been eating pho religiously all my life allllll over town. They're in a run down plaza operated by a family I would guess, based on how there's a couple really young teens working there. 

The broth is amazing and portion is huge! Price is cheaper than average and definitely worth a try if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I am happy to find this place at Yelp. It is so far the best pho I had in GTA area. 
I ordered the raw beef with beef brisket and my friend ordered the grill chicken spring roll vietnam noodles.
Both of them are so different than the taste you had out there. They have a unique kind of taste. 
Their beef are so soft and tender. My friend was tempted to order an extra bowl for take out because of that.
All in all, cheap eat with good quality."}
{"text":"For the price, this place is pretty clutch. The pad Thai is always a good bet and the servers are quick and leave you alone, which is nice for conversations. They give you everything you need all at once at the beginning. Not a fan of their fried options in terms of meat, but it's a very extensive menu so I've tried maybe 3% of what they offer. I'm a regular there."}
{"text":"I feel guilty writing this update as the staff at this restaurant are very polite.  But I have to be completely honest.  Today's experience was not great.  The pho was edible, but didn't have much depth of flavour, the spring rolls I ordered were burned and I actually went back after work to return them and ask for my money back.  I'm sorry, but providing burned items as part of a take-out order is inexcusable.  I am very disappointed.  As I said - the staff here are very pleasant and polite.  But the food today was a major disappointment.  I'm sorry ..."}
{"text":"Taste is good, portion was okay.  Sour sop shake, not so good.  Maybe because we've had the real stuff in Cuba.  Grilled beef is super salty, thank goodness for the bland veggies and vermicelli.  Doesn't need to be that salty though."}
{"text":"This place has also do it yourself rice paper rolls or wraps! I have been on a Vietnamese craving trend and can have it everyday! Other then the flies/pests flying around, the food is decent!
They have an extensive viet Chinese menu! 
I would have gave it a 4 if there wasn't so many bugs flying around!"}
{"text":"Friendly efficient kids out front.... Mom and Pop must be cooking in the back! Considerate and kind service. Impressive amount of attention to detail for an in and out place. Busy for a reason. Solid pho. Server offered to precook the sprouts for an elderly member of our party before I even thought to ask. Best dry noodle options in TO in a long time. Tiny but bland but nothing more hoisin and sriracha won't fix. Homestyle in a really good way. Will definitely return with more mouths! Yes the plaza is definitely shecky but this spot is not. Just go in and you'll see!"}
{"text":"Fast service, good portions and weekly specials. The seafood red curry had too much coconut in it. But theHue noodles was tasty enough.
 
I see some people eating the rice portions which are huge too. Ambience is like a fast food restaurant. Although they can get rather busy during the weekends. But they clean up fast"}
{"text":"Don't come after 10 pm. The waiter might sweep the floor while you eating. The feeling that dirts from the floor might fly around the food make me feel sick"}
{"text":"From newer positive reviews, I decided to try it again. So food still isn't as good as other places close by. Prices are much higher than before, doesn't justify me returning in the future."}
{"text":"Ok.. so I've come here a few more times and I'm convinced this place deserves a 5.. The staff are always smiling, nice and polite. 
The pho:
-The broth tastes very bold with strong anise and meaty flavour
-Tasty meatballs.. good quality
-Tripe cooked perfectly with no fishy taste
- Nothing too special about the beef flank/rare but there's a lot of it and it's tasty
- The tendon has deep broth flavour infused from long boiling
-large quantities
-not stingy with veggies

*for the spicy eaters, really spicy pickled peppers.

One of my faves for sure."}
