{"text":"Great spot with fantastic cocktails and rustic French cuisine. They had music on the Wednesday we went with a bartender very knowledgeable on different types of absinthe."}
{"text":"Five stars for service and atmosphere. We came here on a Saturday night--no wait, we were seated upstairs, which was pretty quiet and were able to grab one of the couches for our party of three. It was our first time with absinthe but our server was amazing at explaining each choice and flavor profiles. I probably won't be having absinthe very often, I'll say, but it was a pretty cool first experience with it."}
{"text":"Raclette is a French/ Swiss meal consisting in melting delicious cheese on top of potatoes, veggies and/or charcuterie.  It's an interactive meal, a bit like fondue or Korean BBQ, where you wait for the cheese to melt (don't worry cheese melts fast).

Going to Coq of the Walk for a cheese raclette was a great experience, not only because it's rare to find a restaurant that serve French raclette, but mostly because it was so tasty! I honestly don't think they cook anything wrong there.
Our waiter was very helpful in choosing drinks and gave us just the right amount of attention. 
I will definitely go back!
I would recommend this place to chill amongst friends, or even for a date night. Its dim lighting and mellow mood makes it perfect to converse without having to shout across the table."}
