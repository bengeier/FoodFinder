{"text":"Great quality cheap and cheery sushi. The dragon rolls are to DIE for. but the chirashi needs improvement"}
{"text":"The sushi is great! However, they recently changed over to 'Kibo Sushi', and prices have gone up.   As an example, I used to order the Love boat for 2. $32.95 and came with soup, salad, 32 pieces of sushi and your choice of roll.  Since the change to Kibo, they kept the same price but removed the choice of roll. Other menu items are also up in price, which moves the price tier of the restaurant from 'Slightly more pricey but delicious' to 'Meh, it's a little too pricey to justify the cost'. Also adding in a delivery fee?  I guess it's typical of an ownership change to increase prices/adjust the bottom line, but I'll probably be eating here less frequently from now on."}
{"text":"Ended up at this lovely little placed tucked away on a side street near Summerhill. The day was nice, the sun was bright and boy was the sushi tasty. It was wonderfully fresh and the Bento Box we ordered was generously portioned. It had lovely morsels of beef teriyaki, crisp tempura veggies and some delicious gyoza dumplings. Apart from the side order of spicy salmon and tuna sushi, this was a very filling and full portioned meal. We ended up talking some home after.   I highly recommend this place. Definitely one of the better sushi places I've been too!"}
{"text":"Ah-mazing sushi! Their takeout is delicious, they spice their tempura to give it a little more flavor and the service is amazing. Like any typical non AYCE place they give you a small soup with the meal and their miso is wonderful. They have an extensive menu and the prices are not bad!  We do tons of takeout from them they are really fast and affordable and friendly!"}
{"text":"Great little find on a side street just off Yonge, several blocks south of St. Clair. Very authentic feel to this little Japanese bistro. We stayed away from the usual sushi and sashimi, just to try something different. Everything was very good. Quite small, a few tables, a number of booths and one very large table, felt very cozy. We will be back with bigger appetites and try more variety. And will bring friends because this is a gem we want to share."}
{"text":"I went here with my brother for dinner.  We got lucky and found a free parking spot across from the restaurant on Walker Ave.   The owner makes the food himself, and I must say, it's one of the better sushi/sashimi/rolls I've had.  We order the boat for 2, and the portion was good for two hungry guys. :)  The staff was helpful and friendly too.  I noticed a lot of people were getting takeout, which is understandable because there aren't that many seating available. Only one downside I noticed was the location & condition of their bathroom.  I had to go down to the basement and then make a few turns to get to a dated, dark bathroom just to wash my hands before the meal.  I suggest you wash your hands before you get there :) All in all, I'd go back here for the food!"}
{"text":"Located just north of LCBO summerhill, Yonge/ Walker Ave. 'Asahi Sushi - Summerhill' offers great menu with fresh ingredients. Cozy atmosphere with friendly staff and chef/owner. It opened this summer, 2011 and it's definitely a great addition to the neighborhood and business nearby for a good dine in or take out for very reasonable prices. It's a small Sushi restaurant but serves big flavour!!!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"First time at Kibo Sushi at Summerhill.  Since I live in the neighborhood and my fav Japanese restaurant which was owned and operated by a Japanese closed down recently, I decided to give place a try.  kibo Sushi is owned and operated by Koreans and is a small joint with mediocre decor and music tuned to Jazz FM station (they must change this to create a better ambience and to avoid patrons having to listen to frequent commercials and news bits!).  I ordered Unni and ikura sushi and both were exceptionally fresh.  I also ordered deep fried oysters but the batter was too thick..  They served miso soup on the house but it lacked flavor big time. I think I will come back for the fresh sushi but this place needs to improve on many fronts to make it a memorable experience to its patrons!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot, hidden away a bit just off of Yonge.  Very reasonable prices for fresh food, generous quantities.  I always go for one of the bento boxes.  I really like the small salad that comes with the box.. almost all sushi spots at this price point would give you iceberg lettuce with bottled dressing, but Kibo gives you good mixed greens with shaved carrots and beets and the freshest homemade orange dressing.  The dressing is so sweet and good that I mix it into my water glass when the salad is done!  Makes a refreshing fruit drink  :P   The tempura has a bunch of veggies you don't often see like asparagus and onion slices.  I appreciate the brown rice option (for a buck or 2 more).. all sushi places should have a brown rice option but sadly few do.    My pro-tip for the beer drinkers is to ask for the tall can of Asahi, it's only 5 bucks - good value."}
{"text":"Good and real Japanese food. Very comfortable, noon lunch hour is super busy. Try go after 1:30 is much better. Great butter fish and avocado salad. Has booth for private conversation.   Cute deco. Price is very fair, lunch special under $10. Great place to grab a work lunch or for small group to hang out."}
{"text":"Nothing really special about this place, whether in terms of food (sashimi was good but the sushi rice was terrible), service (fast enough and they refill your tea when you ask, that's about it), or ambience (clean and quiet, pretty teacups besides disposable utensils...and their only menu is the takeout version). Price is probably on the higher side but the quality is correspondingly above average.  One thing that did impress me in a way was just how peaceful the restaurant was lol. Lots of private booths and zero crowd (at least during the 3 hours we were there on a weekend afternoon). Great place to sit down and talk without being disturbed!"}
{"text":"Took a walk on a nice day after work around the Summerhill area and was in the mood for some sushi. First place I saw was Asahi Sushi and I'm glad I went in. It's a small place near Yonge street, north of Summerhill station. The place was empty since it was just before 6pm and I was greeted by the friendly staff. Decided to get take away:  - Sashimi & Spicy tuna roll combo ($13) Fresh fish and good flavour.  The roll was okay, they put the spicy sauce on top of the roll but I prefer the sauce mixed in. They placed the pickled ginger on a paper cup so the liquid didn't spread out to the sushi... nice little touch! - Mixed tempura appetizer ($7) It comes with 2 shrimps and 6 various veggies. The lady asked if I wanted a particular veggie and she can put more of those instead - another little nice touch. When I got home and opened the box, they had loaded it with extra veggies! This was big enough to be a meal on its own.  Those little touches were worth ALOT! The food was nice and fresh, service was Awesome! Worth a visit if you're in the area craving for sushi."}
{"text":"There are a few sushi places in the area but Asahi is for sure the best of the bunch. Food is always fresh. The only draw back is that it's near two schools and on occasion I have come for lunch and been turned away as it is filled with kids. (Good for them, but bad for me!)"}
{"text":"It was great! We ordered a Maki Platter B party set and it came out fast, hot and delicious. It's going to be my new go-to!"}
{"text":"Customer walks into sushi place \"Sorry, we have no rice today\" Customer leaves sushi place, never to return"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found this place!! We have a few sushi places in the area that are very \"meh\". I love sushi, so I was really disappointed by the places in the area. This place is amazing.  The fish is always fresh--and everything truly is delicious. They have great selection on the menu and the prices are fine. I've done takeout many times (I think they also offer delivery), and they're always quick and friendly.  I think this is the best sushi restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Do NOT do delivery with these guys. They are unprofessional at best. Ordered online, included a tip in the bill, paid cash, driver did not have proper change (only $1) and complained about having to pay that. The website specifically said cash was being paid so there was no reason for driver not to have change except they wanted extra money in addition to the tip."}
{"text":"We ordered from foodora and it arrived within half an hour if not less. We ordered a 50piece maki,sushi,sashimi platter for less than $60 including delivery and taxes. Quality was fresh and the platter had a good selection of rolls and sashimi. They don't fill it up with all the regular cheap stuff like salmon and California rolls. Consists of fresh red and white tuna, snapper, etc. and some specialty rolls."}
{"text":"Sushi go-to in the neighbourhood. Always really fresh and tasty, and they are quick for pick-up orders, and also friendly and lots of tea when you go to eat in."}
{"text":"Got their lunch special, the small udon with six pieces of california roll for $9.95. Though, it cannot compare to an authentic Japanese udon place, it was fresh and tasty as always"}
{"text":"Went for lunch during weekday, was busy, but def nothing special here. Not bad not great.  Been to the other kibo at king and its so much better there. Though you do get to dine here proper though"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. We are very fortunate to have them in our neighborhood!"}
