{"text":"Excellent service.  Food is mediocre.  

On a recent visit with several friends we ordered a large assortment of dishes and were underwhelmed.  The first thing we noticed is that Ibiza would be lost without their squeeze bottle of balsamic reduction.  The brown swirly lines appeared liberally on or under every dish we had whether the dish may benefit from that flavor or not.   This should tell you everything you need to know about the rest of the plates.  The actual food is decent quality, but the execution carries little of craftsmanship or culinary distinction the menu descriptions and prices should warrant.  

I'll give the Fish Skewer as an example because it was par for the courses.  This has three very different types of fish with different oil contents requiring different cooking times. On a skewer cooked together, you end up with one cooked appropriately, one overcooked and one undercooked.  End result is not horrible, just mediocre, with a lot of balsamic reduction drizzled over it.   

Our meal ended with some forgettable desserts.  One was what may have been a Jell-o mouse topped with what was definitely Redi-Wip.  

We loved the Sangria and the atmosphere, but felt the food was overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"Nothing special, good service and food, was not very full for a weekend at 830 pm and expected the atmosphere to be better.  Plenty of unique options that you cannot get else where in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I wish I could rave about a place like this because the idea of a tapas bar in Pittsburgh is a great concept but the execution is not stellar.

I went with my boyfriend after receiving a Groupon for $25 worth of food; we were excited to try something new and different. We ordered a bottle of wine which was delightful as on Tuesdays bottles of wine not on the Captain's List at half-off (though this bottle of wine would later cause issues with the use of a Groupon). We ordered four dishes since we were starving and were expecting tapas sized dishes. The orders were large and were hit and miss. The filet was exceptional. The meat and cheese platter was great and was enough for both of us and some to bring home. We order ceviche and it was ok, less pepper would have been nice. I love calamari but this was not worth the order and we wish we got something else.

The service was great: the staff was knowledgable and make sure that we always had a full glass of soda and water and anything we needed. 

One issue did come up when we tried to redeem the Groupon. We ordered alcohol and Groupon could not be used towards the purchase or alcohol. While we understood this, we ordered well over $25 dollars worth of food almost 3 times that amount so why couldn't it be used towards the food purchase. While this was cleared up, it was confusing as they didn't seem to understand how it worked though they place themselves on the website.

I would go back as now I know what not to order and how large the portions are."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place always has groupons.

It lures in unsuspecting patrons with them. 

Because, once you go, you will never, ever go back. 

Horrible food. Slow service. Overpriced. The food is mostly frozen and then thawed. Taste just like the frozen appetizers from the grocery store! 

The spicy potatoes are nothing more than potatoes with Frank's Red Hots. The scallops were obviously frozen and then over cooked and drowned in soy sauce. Mmm chewy soy saucey pieces....

This is not tapas. This is not \"European\" or \"Ethnic.\" This is crap. Total and complete crap with an expensive price tag. 

And why doesn't yelp have \"tacky and outdated\" in their ambiance category?"}
{"text":"we went for tapas on a saturday night, the food was awful, the cheese and meat plate was pre-prepared and so old an cold we hadto chisel the meat off with a fork and the cheese was stained from sausage slices resting on them for who knows how long! the rest got no better just more expensive, both the scallops and lamb we tastless, the calmari was soft and still had the stringy membrane attached, yuck! never going back"}
{"text":"Great wine selection. Tapas menu was what I used to order. Very extensive. Heavy on seafood. Light on beef."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely overrated. I went for restaurant week and did not enjoy a single course! Cannot imagine paying full price for any of it. In addition, I went with a group of 8 and it took us over two and a half hours to eat dinner! Bad service and bad food...let's hear more!

Now for the food...the artichoke empanadas aren't even empanadas and are so poorly battered that I could have made them better. The crust was thick, dry, and lacked crunch. Next the lobster ravioli weakly tasted like lobster and the vodka sauce it was made in lacked cream, which was substituted for peppers. The entire dish just tasted like a burnt pepper and the pasta was gummy. Lastly the chocolate mousse was unbearably whiskey flavored and so heavy that no one ate more than two bites. 

The atmosphere is cute for a date, but don't bring a foodie. Honestly surprised this place is in business."}
{"text":"Interestingly, the host doubled as our waiter. He was great and worked his butt off for our table of 8. Other than that, this place was not good. Cold food, and subpar drinks. Also the bathroom was disgusting."}
{"text":"It was okay.  Not impressed.  Had a scallops tapas and it was not fully cooked.  Won't be back anytime soon.  LOVE Mallorca though!"}
{"text":"Went to Ibiza with a restaurant.com certificate, wary of the mediocre ratings on Yelp, yet trying to keep an open mind. The decor was comfortable and trendy, service attentive on a fairly busy weekend night. I have to say, these were the largest tapas portions I've ever experienced, AND the only place where the bread plate is constantly refilled. You will walk away full for sure. However, the portions did not really make up for the more or less uninspired flavors and presentation of the food. Everything seems to be dressed with the same two tiny slivers of bell peppers...

Here's what we tried: 
Marinated artichoke salad - BIG bowl of greens, artichokes had a nice kick to it
Baked brie special - this was pretty decent, crispy and flaky on the outside, nice accompaniment of candied fruit
Stuffed banana peppers - mushy and bland
Salmon tartar - thought it could have used some more acidity, but was ok
Scallops with mango sauce - also just ok, texture was somewhat lacking and the flavor of the mango sauce wasn't the refreshing match I was hoping for
Filet mignon medallion - executed well, was juicy, tender, and medium rare as we had asked for, but again the flavor didn't seem terribly special  

Overall it was ok, just didn't get the \"wow, delish\" reaction I have had at most other tapas restaurants."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants to bring clients and out of town guests to.  The decor is a bit trendy but not over powering, they do have valet so you do not have to fight with on street parking, and the staff has always been friendly and prompt.  

The selection of food is great.  Remember this is a tapas restaurant when you only get 3 meatballs.  We have never had a problem with food except we never have enough room to eat everything on the menu!  The bar is fully stocked and the bartenders know how to mix a decent martini or mojito.  Everyone we have ever taken here requests to visit again when they're in town.   

I highly suggest this restaurant if you want to leave a great first impression.  Dates, clients, and MILs alike.  They will all love it."}
{"text":"I've had a couple of very different dining experiences here at Ibiza.  My first experience here was horrible - if it weren't for the fact that I wasn't alone, I would swear I must have remembered it wrong.  But, I'll spare you the details and not really let it affect my review, because I think a lot of the problems were due to its being newly opened at the time.  

Since then, I had another friend who wanted to give it a try and so I agreed, with a bit of apprehension.  The wine bar is next to Mallorca and owned/operated by the same people.  There is a front dining area, the wine bar itself which is small, a back dining area, and when decent weather prevails, a back patio.  I highly recommend that back patio if you can get it - it has a good vibe to it and is private and cozy.  The staff still gets an attitude that is a bit pretentious, as well as their hosting staff, but other than that, the service is fine.  The tapas itself I feel is slightly overpriced, but decent.  I have also had better tapas in general so that clouds how I feel the pricing is.

Pittsburgh lacks for decent wine bars, so in light of that, Ibiza isn't all that bad.  The food and wine list are decent, so definitely worth a try.  I'd really give this place a 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Terrible!  I do not understand why this place is ever crowded.  

*The food is wayyyyy over priced for what it was.  
*The silverware was dirty. 
*The napkin smelled like a dirty restaurant kitchen. 
*We were sat on the second floor, next to all their \"decorative\" liquor & champagne bottles- which were dusty and looked sticky. 
*The mussels just tasted bad.  Super rubbery & fishy. 
*Also ordered the raw kobe beef, which honestly was good, but for $18- you expect to get more than 4 slices- thinner than lunch meat. 

We used a groupon, even after using that, the bill was way too high. 

Thank god primanti brothers is a few blocks away, since you walk out of there with a nearly $100 bill and starving!!! 
Ibiza sucks!"}
{"text":"Ibiza is by far my absolute favorite resturant in southside of Pittsburgh.  Its a lovely enviroment. You can tell that everyone in the resturant is truly enjoying themselves. Southside is full of crazy college students looking for a lay and some beer, but once you get off the streets of east carson and inside the doors of Ibiza its another world. Your absolutely happy you made it. 

The food is fantastic especially the hummus and bread they give you before your food comes. My friend and I loved it so much we ordered more. We also had their goat cheese salad, calamari, and the lamb chops. I was so happy I was there enjoying great food and wine I didnt want to leave. 

Our server was a short lady who was really nice. She took very good care of us. The manager even came over and asked how we were doing. I looked at him and said never been better. The rest of the staff seemed just as lovely. I recommend Ibiza to everyone."}
{"text":"First, if you care about real sangria, do not order it here. I sat at the bar and watched them make several glasses and pitchers (after already ordering it myself). They use Franzia boxed wine, orange juice concentrate mixed with tap water, and Bankers Club bourbon, with a few orange slices. At $12 per glass and $24 per pitcher, it's quite a ripoff. That said, it tasted ok. 

Second, this is not a good place for vegetarians. They only have a few meat-free options, and less than they did the last time I went there about 4 years ago. Even the portobello risotto uses a veal stock, which the server was kind enough to mention.

Finally, they pack the closed-in patio area like sardines. I have rarely ever sat in such a crowded restaurant. 

Bottom line: this place is too expensive for the food, drinks, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"My last experience was a tapas place was nearly 12 years ago - small, expensive plates, with slow service.  I haven't been inclined to try it again.

As a result, I wasn't expecting too much heading to Ibiza, but I was pleasantly surprised with the food.  As I pre-gamed the menu selections, I was annoyed that the prices were rather high.  Honestly, a $16 tapas plate in the 'burgh is rather extravagant - and when I compare that price to Ken Oringer's Toro, that restaurant offers foie gras or lobster tail for the same price.

The quantity of food, though, was very generous.  Of course, you then wonder if you really doing tapas when you can't finish your plate.  But, hey, this is America, man, where bigger is better, and the more the merrier.  We only had 4 dishes - Mussels, Chorizo, Artichoke Fritters, and a cheese plate - but they were more than enough.  The mussels were in a lemon-juice broth, which wasn't as flavorful or rich as those at Park Bruges, but the mussels were big and juicy.  The chorizo was a large plate, and when you combined the saltiness of the chorizo, the sweetness of the raisins, and the crunch of the pine nuts and spinach, each bite was a burst of flavor.

I thought service was very good and attentive, although we did eat a bit earlier.  While our server was okay, another table behind us had a waitress who gave great detail and explanation of the dishes.  When you're trying tapas for the first time, you really hope for some guidance, especially with such a large variety of dishes.

I actually think that this place would be great for a date - granted your date is willing to try new and different foods.  If not, perhaps that's your hint to move on!  Who wants to date a square?"}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner last Tuesday. Staff was friendly and very attentive. It was half-price select bottles of wine night, so we picked a nice bottle. The manager came over and explained he didn't want to serve that wine, so he picked two (clearly higher end and older) bottles for us to choose. He favored the Portuguese bottle, and after a taste we approved--with flying colors!  

we picked four dishes--two specials (crab cakes, a little fried for my taste but had a nice kick; scallops with pomegranate, FANTASTIC; chorizo and potatoes, pretty good; and lamb...amazing. so good.). Both the flan and the chocolate mousse were awesome. 

Ambiance was very nice. I don't know why they play techno/house music, though."}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice right off the Birmingham bridge. I am originally from San Antonio Texas and the back room had a waterfall wall that reminded me of the River Walk. The Portabella mushroom Risotto was big enough to box but the other plates were definitely meant to go around a table of 3 or 4 one time. Attentive servers made the whole experience very pleasant. It is priced at a \"we are going out tonight\" rate but for the quality of food is worth it. 

Just a few specifics. We went around 4:30- it started filling up around 5:15. The most exotic dish at the table was a thin slice of raw Kobe beef with salad on top. If you are not sure what to get just ask- our waitress know the menu really well and seemed to be used to giving recommendations. 

Great evening over all."}
{"text":"I lived in Spain for a few years so I started craving Spanish food when I came back.  I went there with a person who had never been to Spain so i said we would order a bunch of stuff so that she could try alot of things.

PROs

1. this place was so bad that i just started cooking Spanish food myself, so now i can.

CONs... many In short the food was forgettable I couldnt even tell you what my entree was, but two things stuck out the most to me 

1. The Jamon (cured ham) had small white hard balls in it, this generally happens when u cut it off the leg and leave it out for a day or two, or its prepackaged and has sat out.  Not a good sign when u are paying $15 for a few pieces. So it definitely was not fresh and also the waiter could not tell me where it came from... Jamon in Spain ranges from 10 to hundreds of euros for a kilo.

2. The tortilla (Spanish omelet) the potatoes were crunchy and severely under cooked. You could get a tortilla at a gas station in Spain ( yes they sell them) for 3 euros and its significantly bigger and exponentially better

3. The staff did not seem particularly knowledgeable, i asked several questions they did not have answers to.  Where the jamon was from, what cheese if any was in the croquettas, and what was in a tortilla.

All in all it was disappointing i spent about $150 on food that would cost 40 euros in Madrid tops. Alot of the things they offer as tapas are complementary on a traditional Spanish restaurant with a drink. 

The quality was lacking.  If you have never eaten Spanish food before you might find its good, but i assure you this the a very low end restaurant by Spanish standards, but i guess since there are not many options in Pittsburgh for spanish restaurants and many people have never been to Spain they just don't know what to look for"}
{"text":"I was under-impressed.  Stay far away from the calamari which came as a lump of fried mass of chewy something."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Awesome atmosphere. Love the flight of wines.....great for vegetarians..."}
{"text":"I went to Ibiza for dinner on Friday night. Good service, great heated back patio, overall atmosphere was above average. However, the food was simply middle of the road. I left satisfied, happy that I chose Ibiza for dinner, but not needing to go back. Half of the tapas we ordered were delicious, half were bland. The wine flights had four wines, and heavy pours, but the quality of wine was lacking. I have no major complaints about Ibiza, but there's got to be a better tapas place in Pittsburgh. 

Go for the atmosphere, a few drinks, and the olives are awesome! If you're looking for a full meal, I'd say your money is better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been to Mallorca next door many, many time but have never crossed over next door to Ibiza. It took a groupon to finally push it over the limit and head on it. 

We were actually the only people in there arriving shortly after opening in a Saturday. We had great service and explanation of the various specials. We ended up going with a meat platter and a mozzarella tomato salad. Everything was cooked perfectly to our asking and seasoned well. The food came out quickly and the waitress supplied is with quite a few free bread rolls.

Overall great dining experience from food to service."}
{"text":"Coulda shoulda been a better meal...I was there about a month ago and left with literally a bad taste in my mouth (a garlic overload that unfortunately lingered).  I had the Grilled Veggies and Fish Shish Kabob.  The veggies were OK but I was left confused by the large un-grilled (huh?!) slab of tasteless (could not have been local/ripe) tomato. The kabob had potential but of the three pieces of fish one was undercooked (my appetite kinda vanished when I tried it) and all (mystery fish, salmon and swordfish) were placed on top on an excessively garlic sauce.  Lacking a toothbrush, mints and gum were defeated against its Hercules strength.  
 My date had the Shrimp  with Romescu sauce was OK with it.  Nothing was terrific and some parts fell short of even kinda good...
Service was decent but for a quiet week night a little more effort should have been made.  Plus the Host lacked warmth:( 
Sorry but not worth the effort to try again...too bad..."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first about this restaurant, because I heard that it was overly expensive for the sizes portions.  However, after taking a leap of faith, I decided to see what this restaurant had to offer and I was pleasantly surprised by the menu.  True,  the dishes are a little more on the pricey side, but if you are looking for a wonderful classy dining experience, Ibiza is definitely a place you need to try.  My favorite dish were the Tuna Wontons, which were absolutely delicious and served in a healthy sized portion. 
I would say that the quality of food at Ibiza definitely justifies the price and makes it a four star restaurant."}
{"text":"GREAT menu, flights and very friendly staff. Be ready for larger portions than most normal tapas joints. Sat at the bar and was waited on by Kerri. She was very knowledgeable on the menu and what would fit our tastes. We had 8 deferent items that were all perfect! Each had there own different unique flavor. For the atmosphere, service and quality overall the price point is well worth giving this place a try!!!! I'm surprised this place didn't at least get 4 stars by others. That's why I'm writing this review and hopefully there will be others to give a very positive review!!!"}
{"text":"Really nice selection of wines and tapas . It can be a little pricey so I usually take my dates to dinner first and then go here for the atmosphere and drinks. Most of the wait staff are knowledgeable and friendly. It's a nice place to take very nice date :)"}
{"text":"I was skeptical to dine here after reading the previous reviews, but it turned out pretty good! I definitely suggest reservations, especially on the weekends. They have an amazing wine list, although I wish there was more of a selection for glasses rather than just bottles. The meat and cheese plate was very filling but a bit on the pricey side for $18! There was a nice selection of different meats and cheeses. The stuffed banana peppers with veal left a little to be desired. The calamari and sea scallops with mango sauce were both delicious! I wish there were more than three scallops per order thought! I could have eaten another order. So all in all, not bad, a bit pricey, but I would go back on another occasion."}
{"text":"Overall good wine selection and decent small plates. Some dishes lack proper execution which is a shame cause Ibiza isn't incredibly inventive in their dishes.

I was excited to take my boyfriend to Ibiza after a pleasant experience about 2 years ago. We walked in and were warmly greeted and seated on the patio by the hostess. Then the fun began... A waitress with more makeup on than a pageant girl took our wine orders. One minute later another waiter came up to us and asked to take our drink orders. Confused, we informed him that another waitress already took care of us. 30 seconds later we heard the two waiters get in a verbal altercation about the table. After that extremely unprofessional argument , it was a rather awkward dining experience. (They should've offered us a free app, ha) 

Here is what we tried that evening:
Mushroom brushetta - Would be a good dish had it not been over salted. 
Chorizo catalan con patatas - Fresh and cooked. Very smoky flavor if your into that. Boyfriend was a big fan. It wasn't edible for me but I hate smoky things!
Vieras a la parrilla en salsa de mango (Sea Scallops) - YUM! Cooked perfectly and the mango sauce was an interesting and delicious accompaniment 
Shrimp with romescu sauce - Hard to mess this dish up, we were pleased. 
Artichoke fritters with fresh garlic and olive oil - Best thing we ate here! delicious don't miss this if you dine here"}
{"text":"I want to start this by saying that our waitress and bartender were great. That being said, the manager needs an attitude adjustment. We were a large party (14) promised the upstairs dining room but upon arrival we were told another party had the room. ( I had called 2 weeks in advanced and called a week before to double check we had the room so we could decorate) We were moved twice and told about how annoying it was to move us and made the overall experience horrible from the start. Dinner was okay...salvaged the beginning of the night. Upon paying the bill our coupons were not accepted even though our waitress did try to help us out, we ended up paying way more for the meal than we should have. We had a living social coupon and another person in our group had a groupon...one coupon per table no matter if your check is separate.(would have been good to know)  Overall, disappointing and a waste of money."}
{"text":"I purchased a discount coupon for wine flights from Living Social for this restaurant, knowing we would be on vacation and may like to try out a Pittsburgh Tapas/Wine Bar.  We had a terrible experience using the voucher, which is released via Living Social by the restaurant itself (it's their choice to put out this coupon), for those unfamiliar with Living Social.  

The manager on duty on Friday night told the server two different things when we challenged her on the interpretation of the voucher.  We paid $15 for a \"Wine Flight for Two,\" and she tried to say that we had to \"choose one under $15 as the free one.\"  What free one?  Can't she read the coupon they offered?  We paid $15 already to get the voucher!  So it ended up being more expensive to use the voucher.  I would not go here again, based on the fact that they are trying to rip people off.  I'm also filing a complaint with Living Social, because they do a good job providing this service to those who use online coupons.  They don't need restaurants like this giving them a bad name.  

As for the flights and food...they were okay.  We had two flights of wine, and some of the wines had been open way too long.  We also had a cheese platter and chocolate mousse.  The mousse was good.  But they didn't even tell you what was on the cheese platter.  For a tapas bar, that is very unusual.  The cheeses were nothing to brag about.

Our server (Jacob, also the bartender) was great though!  He apologized and tried his best to resolve the situation.  Unfortunately management wasn't as concerned about guests in her establishment."}
{"text":"Pros: Food is good.

Cons: Food is expensive for portion sizes. Service is slow. 

Got the duck prosciutto salad and eggplant rollatine hot tapas plate. Salad was a decent size, eggplant was 3 very small round slices. It didn't seem to make any sense at all that the price difference on these 2 plates was only $1. I could live with the price of the salad, but that eggplant shouldn't be any more than $8. Left hungry. 

Even with a LivingSocial/Groupon/etc. I don't really think it's worth it. Glad I tried it though. I still have a few vouchers so I'll go back and try other items to see if my experience is any better."}
{"text":"This past Friday night was my first time ever going to Ibiza. The restaurant itself is cute but they sat us outside. It was very muggy and hot and the only fans they had were ceiling fans that did nothing but push the hot air around. I had gone for my 25th birthday with 15 of my friends and I can honestly say that none of us had a great experience. I had purchased a coupon on Groupon along with a few other of my friends. Now, on the groupon it does say that only one groupon can be used per table but we figured that since there were 15 of us and we were all paying separate that maybe they would honor them...well we were wrong. When the waiter told us that he could only take one I asked to speak to the manager. The manager explained to me why he could only take one and even though I though it was bs I accepted it. Keep in mind though that the manager was extremely rude. There were 15 of us...all of us spending at least $50 and he couldn't do anything about it? To me that's a great way to ensure that most of those 15 people wont ever be going back. I think the worst part out of the coupon catastrophe though was that one of the girls had a coupon from restaurant.com a coupon from a totally different website and they wouldn't let her use it. I can understand the whole groupon issue but her coupon was from a totally different site. 

Other than the stupid coupon issues the food was OK. I had the fried calamari, veal stuffed banana peppers, and some sort of potatoes. The calamari was thick and chewy/gummy. Not really too enjoyable. The stuffed banana peppers were so extremely spicy that I could barely eat them. and the potatoes also were extremely spicy. I think I only ate about 5 bites until I couldn't take it anymore. While there I also had two drinks. I had a white sangria which was predominately pineapple juice. Very sour...very unenjoyable. I also had a mojito (which is my absolutely favorite drink) that was wayyy too sweet. I pretty much went from one extreme to the next with my drinks. 

All in all I guess my first experience wasn't a great one but I'm willing to give it another shot. Maybe I'll ask to be seated inside and order something else."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service!! Highly recommend the mushroom bruschetta, fish shish kebabs, quail, all excellent. We will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Visited Ibiza on Thursday evening using a Groupon.   We called and made a reservation according to the instructions and were greeted on time with a smile.   The service was excellent including explanations and recommendations!  

The food was fantastic....we ate every bite and used the abundance of bread to soak up every drop of sauce.   Plates included meat/cheese/olives, shrimp, pork/clams, mushroom bruscetta, spanish tortilla, and  2 glasses of excellent wine.  My only complaint was that while the cheeses were great, no one told me what I was eating.  That would have been a great addition!

I was still smiling about the meal Friday afternoon.....I will definately return!"}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would.
Way over priced 
Cheap food purchases that are trying to presented in a trendy high end atmosphere and prepared poorly.
The chef is making bad choices with his menu i.e. artichoke fritters...canned artichokes that are breaded and fried.  No seasoning or marinade.  Just oily metallic flavored artichokes.  Eggplant rolletine... thick slices of eggplant with marinara and some cheap goat cheese sprinkled on top.  not stuffed and rolled eggplant.
Very disappointing.... I will not go back!"}
{"text":"Service was fast. Atmosphere was appropriate. Thought the sangria was ok. All of the food was delicious. Chili lime shrimp was my favorite but we had 4 different small plates which we shared. We went with a group of 6 and everyone enjoyed the food. Would definitely go back. Portions are small and you will spend between 30 and 50 bucks per person with drinks so if that isn't your cup of tea you might not like it. If you like delicious good and good atmosphere this is a good place."}
{"text":"Food was great and the service was pretty good, but don't go on a cold night. The entire place is very cold. We were seated in th back room with the space heaters and 5 of them did not do it well. Then I went downstairs to the ladies room and the stairwell is completely open to the air from the entrance. It's was easily 20 degress colder in the stairwell and the bathroom didn't seem to be heated either. Sitting down was like sitting on ice. When I came upstairs staff seemed to be familiar with the problem and recommended a heat vent I could stand under. I engaged with two different staff members about how cold the restaraunt was. This is ridiculous for  place that charges $11 for one glass of sangria. Again the food was great (but not the sardines, they were dry and bitter) but it was crazy cold in there."}
{"text":"I was home visiting for the holidays in December and went here with 5 friends. We made reservations but the table was set for 5, not 6, and when we asked for additional silverware, etc staff just sighed and walked away! While the food was fair, the service was absolutely horrible. Our waiter was especially rude, actually making comments about how he didn't want to answer our questions! Hands down I wouldn't recommend this place AT ALL solely because of the service."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon to Ibiza and thought we'd try it out.  The Sangria wasn't consistently made and the entrees left a lot to be desired, but the one hot tapas we had was good - veal stuffed hot banana peppers.

If we ever go back, it will just be for drinks and tapas.  Not for a full-dinner."}
{"text":"Ibiza tapas is a guilt pleasure.they. Offer food based on a Mediterranean culinary food with high quality so good to eat and die.i
It's hard to resist going. My friend and I had many different  appetizers my favorite was a scallops and tuna . But the unique was strawberry soup. We had a hard chocolate mousses it was just divine . I would very strong recommends  this tapas for the excellent service, and superb food.

{"text":"Looked like a pretty low key hang out for yuppies on weekends.

It was fun to go in a large group because everyone got to order one plate and share. I got to try the sardines, cured meat/olive/cheese plate and sangria. 

I'd like to go a second time, anyone wanna come with me?"}
{"text":"Waited 45 min for our food which came out cold, sent back an untouched recommended Chardonnay because it was horrible but still got charged 12 for it. Waiter never checked on us. Left hungry due to extremely small portions and am 88 dol poorer. Never willl go back"}
{"text":"Felt weirdly rushed even though we were the only people there. The mussels is great, as is the cheese and cured meat, decent drink menu. However, everything is slightly overpriced for what they're offering, which leaves an unpleasant feeling afterwards."}
{"text":"Starting out the evening we were offered a window seat  to the fireplace. We thought this was a good thing...wrong, mistake 1. Next they proceeded to tell us restaurant week menu can't be ordered their chef quit...staying....mistake 2 We were offered food from the Mallorca menu and not realizing they were going to walk outside with our food and deliver it from the next door restaurant in 14 degree weather we thought they were being very generous.....mistake 3. Mistake 4 occurred when the lights began to flicker and we still stayed. From now on I'm listening to my gut feeling after number 2. 

My dinner entree was the serving equivalent of a toddler meal, while it was tasty it was not nearly enough for an adult to enjoy. I also ordered cheesecake and at this point I was extremely hungry. I put my fork into it and it ran across my plate. The consistency was similar to undercooked scrambled eggs. 

I did give my server an honest response When she picked up plate and she very kindly said sorry and retrieved my check. 35 dollars later I arrived at my hotel and was ready to order room service. 

I won't say this is standard for Ibiza since I've heard some good reviews just want to put it out there....if you make it to mistake number two odds are not in your favor. I'd give it no stars but the option isn't available to me."}
{"text":"Friday was a day for celebration, so I dragged my coworker out to the Southside to utilize the groupon for Ibiza.

It was our first visit, which is saying something since both of us have lived in the burgh for years and love tapas.

Anyhow - overall the whole experience was odd, simply put. 

The food was decent, but nothing that I would write home about or seek out again. 

And we made the mistake of ordering a dirty martini, which was heartbreaking. It was perhaps the first time, this girl has not finished a dirty. 

The service was attentive, but we never heard the specials (but heard them offered to other tables) and yet felt like people were hovering too much. 

Long and short... I am wiling to try it again, but only because I have a few groupons to go. 

Please, Ibiza, help me like you!"}
{"text":"Oh, so sad.

I had eaten at Ibiza before - but it had been at least a year or so.  When I friend suggested it for dinner last night (thanks Groupon!) I was excited to return.  I remembered it been a little pricey, but well worth it.  

Three of us sat down, for a dinner on the earlier side. We were seated on the patio, ordered drinks and started to dig into the Tapas menu.

First off, half the plates were either dirty or extremely worn and scuffed.  The table cloth had spots on it.  (Maybe keeping it outside is hard to keep clean?)

Groupon or not - we ordered alot - about 3-4 dishes a person.  

Spicy Calamari.  Not spicy, really no flavor at all.  Nicely fried...but it tasted like nothing.  Marinara sauce had some red pepper flakes.  (that doesn't count as spicy)

Mussels a la Normand, were ok, nothing to write home about.

Ham fritters (they had a different name) - were pretty good - but you can't mess up cheese potato and ham.

Tomato & Mozz salad - also pretty good - but there was really little dressing so they did a good job cutting a tomato and slicing mozz and artfully arranging.

Blackened Scallops - This one was just bizarre.  Scallops were cooked ok, but slightly overdone. They were dredged in a seasoning and sauteed.  But given the cooking time of scallops - the seasoning on the sides was raw - it was like eating cajun seasoning out of the bottle.  Opposite of yum.

We had some other things...all were meh.  Overall, everything lacked flavor.

Finally, I thought I'd given them a chance on dessert.  We split a chocolate mouse for the 3 of us - just for a taste.  I swear I had a better chocolate pudding cup with redi-whip when I was in high-school.  COME ON!!

It tasted grainy, heavy, and poorly made.   

Wildly disappointing.  Business is reflecting this...which is why I'm assuming they just ran the groupon.  But really they just need to up the quality and preparation of the food they are serving. 

Sigh, they went from pricey & worth it, to over priced and disappointing.  
ugh."}
{"text":"Stellar dining experience - one of the best.  We dined on the patio in the dead of winter with heat lamps warding away any suspicion that we might be cold or uncomfortable.  It was magical!

The decor is chic and tasteful and the open kitchen lends to the exciting atmosphere.  The service was amazing - our waiter did magic tricks and had an awesome French accent.  The sangria was the best I've ever had!  

The filet mignon tapas was succulent and tasty and rack of lamb lightly breaded with couscus and lamb demo glaze was phenomenal.  I would pass on the bruschetta, it was average.  The salad we had was fresh...basically, everything was delicious and every aspect of the dining experience was 5 stars!"}
{"text":"It started off with a more-than-20-minute wait even though we had a reservation. After we finally got seated at the \"tapas and wine bar,\" we waited for the waiter to come to the table. Finally he came, but he knew nothing about wine. We asked for a recommendation for a dry, minerally white wine, and after checking with someone else he brought us a sweet oaked chardonnay. Then there was the ceviche we ordered that didn't actually have avocado in it.. If you want generally mediocre food, consistently slow service, and waiters who don't know the wine or food, go to Ibiza. Otherwise, stay away."}
{"text":"the quality of the food is not worth the money at ALL. we never got half the left over food to take home. salt was the main ingredient in the soup. I know what a filet tastes like - and that's is not the cut of meat we got. the potatoes must have been cooked the day prior - dry and gritty.  the grape salad was so over powered by the acidic balsamic vinegar we could not eat it.  I get better quality meat from McGinnis Sisters.  am I the only one who noticed the duct tape on the plastic windows and exposed insulation?!?!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place, with a Groupon, and it was overall a pretty good experience.  I see a lot of other reviewers mention that they thought it was overpriced, and I'd have to agree with that.  We stuck to the tapas and everything we had was very good. 

They had a lamb chop tapas with hoisin and pistachios which was awesome.  My one complaint was that the chops came in twos, and they provided a serrated knife for us to separate them.  For tapas, I would do all single chops.  But the flavor on them was incredible.

Had the eggplant rollatini, artichoke fritters, olives, roasted vegetable salad, mushroom bruschetta, tilapia ceviche.  All above average, and plenty for two to share.

I have to say, I was most impressed with the service-- very knowledgeable staff, and very attentive without being pains in the ass.

I would definitely go back, for a special occasion.  On payday :-)"}
{"text":"The food was good but not worth their prices. Maybe half off. The food lacked in flavor and I've had better spinach and artichoke dip elsewhere. The butter for the bread was delicious and the sangria was nothing special. The service was subpar. They were only 3 other couples here and we never got asked how we were doing or if we'd like a refill and it was hard to order more food. The food tastes microwaved and they were out things at 5pm... Because they were not preparing food fresh and to order. I wouldn't come back if I was starving and everywhere else was booked."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for a solo dinner on a business trip, and I was very pleased with the decision. The service was great, and everyone was very friendly. I ordered the grilled vegetable salad and the ham croquetas. The croquetas were not exactly like the ones I remember in Spain, but they were actually quite close and absolutely delicious.

Despite a dump of dressing on the salad (most of which I scraped off and the main reason the review gets a 4 and not a 5), the flavor of the veggies was extremely good.

Just a note that both of my dishes had a sweet balsamic sauce with them. I love balsamic flavor so I was digging it, but if you aren't a fan you may want to mention to hold the sauces."}
{"text":"After my first trip to Ibiza, I would have given the restaurant 5-stars, but the second trip definitely changed my mind on this place a lot.  

The first time my then-fiance and I went here on a very quiet Saturday night.  It was winter and the restaurant was practically empty.  The waitress was very sweet and helpful and the food was all delicious.  The only issue that I had that time is how pricey the specials were - and we ordered many of them without realizing how much more they were than many of the other items on the menu.  However, that was more our fault I suppose, but the food was very, very good.

The second time was a disaster, and it was for my bachelorette party.  I actually chose the restaurant based on the first time I had gone.  Big mistake.  We went on the first Saturday in June, but we didn't have a huge group of people by any means (I think 7 total).  We were seated on the back patio, which is very nice.  However the food took forever.  I'm not exaggerating either - they would bring one plate out at a time, and my mom ate last out of everyone.  I actually felt bad for choosing the place, which is ridiculous!  I received one of my plates first, and the time lapse between me getting my plate and my mom getting hers was over an HOUR.  I couldn't believe it.  The manager claimed that it was because the menu was new... well then I think they need to plan better!  It was a disgusting amount of time, and the food was not as good as I remember (probably because I was so angry).  My mom had to seek out the manager to complain, but then he kept coming over to us and trying to give us shots (seriously that was the last thing I wanted).  He kept asking what he could do to make it better.  The obvious answer is to deduct some money from the bill, which he ultimately did, but why did he need to keep asking us?  I don't feel comfortable telling you how to make me happy (which at that point, all I wanted was to get out of there and go have some fun).  Besides the company, my bachelorette party dinner was miserable."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed to say that I did not enjoy my experience here. I really wanted to love this place but I just did not. 
It wasn't the food that disappointed me, although it wasn't great, it was everything else. To start off we were the only people in the restaurant when we came in and got seated at a dirty table. Instead of moving us, the host sprayed down the table while we were sitting there. I thought it was a little 'diner-esq'. This didn't bother me too much though because the host was VERY kind and pleasant. Along the lines of cleanliness, I was not impressed. There were flies EVERYWHERE and in fact, were distracting when I was talking to my date as flies landed all over them. I understand that fly traps are not attractive for a restaurant of this caliber, but something needs to be done.
The real problem was with with service. I am a server at a Latin restaurant with a very similar price point so I expected the server to be of very high quality. I felt like we were putting the server off and waiting on our table (when there was only one other in the restaurant) was inconvenient. I once had a boss say to me 'Not everyone will love our food, but if nothing else, it is your responsibility to make them feel like you care about them'. I couldn't agree more. I just did not feel like the server cared about us at all. For dinner we split three different Tapas. The chorizo and potatoes, which were GREAT! Great flavor, great presentation, and the perfect amount of spice. I LOVED this dish. We also got the tomato bruschetta, which were good, however a quick sprinkle of mild chess would have brought out the flavor of the balsamic a little more in my opinion. We also got the tilapia ceviche which I think lacked flavor. 
When it came time to pay our check, I used a groupon that I had purchased. As a server, I understand how groupons can be frustrating, but it was the restaurants decision to sign up so this is not my problem.  The server returned and said my 20 dollar groupon only saved us 12 dollars. I asked if we could speak to a manager and they responded, 'there is no one here that is in charge here right now'......My options were to come back and try again, or accept the 12 dollars. How was there not ONE person there that couldn't solve this problem, or even explain to me why this was the case???

Overall- I thought that food was not good enough to justify my experience."}
{"text":"I finally came here to try the place my parents swear by - they love it and come here for date night constantly. Well, I say they can keep it - but I certainly won't be coming back.

From the beginning this place failed to impress. While the decor in their covered up courtyard - a water wall and fancy tubes with fire inside of them - was interesting enough, I quickly lost interest in it when my attention went to picking food and drink for the evening.

Unfortunately, in my humble opinion anyway, the menu setup is terrible here. The menu has a wine list in the back, but if you want to know about cocktails or drink specials - or special dishes - you have to pay attention to the board on the wall when you walk in. I'm sorry, but, when I go somewhere, I want everything in the menu in front of me so I can sit and relax instead of bothering my busy waiter - not to mention, I like having the ability to compare things via text descriptions and I never remember anything a waiter tells me. That's just how my mind works.

And now for the kicker: you get your tapas dishes as the food is made. I bring this up as a warning: don't expect your simple salad to come out before your friend's scallops if the cooks don't get to your salad order first. My family all ordered fish-based dishes while I stuck with a tomato salad. The salad was the last item to come out. While waiting for it I nibbled on my bruschetta - but I found out after beginning to eat the bruschetta that beneath the piles of tomatoes and basil, my bread was burned. So disappointing.

In case you couldn't tell already, I was not impressed by my lackluster experience here and I have no intention of returning to this confusing mess of a restaurant. I'll stick to the other tapas places that I've been to and actually enjoyed."}
{"text":"I've been here about 3-4 times so far and though the ambiance is cute, the food continues to disappoint. Even with the Restaurant.com coupons, the food seemed orverpriced. The only dishes I've consistently enjoyed are the FREE bread & hummus and baked brie.

MEH, I'm over this place."}
{"text":"A great date place. We were in town last summer and found this place because we're atmosphere freaks and the large window allows drivers-by to see what they're getting. 

The food was fantastic, the waiter was great, the wines were tasty.

We shared a couple of champagne flights with our tapas and we've pledged to return everytime we're in the burgh.

A great place for upscale eats on E Carson."}
{"text":"I recently hosted a bridal shower at Ibiza and couldn't be happier with the experience. We were set-up in the back covered patio space. It was beautiful and very comfortable for all 50 guests in attendance.  We had a variety of great entree options and everyone loved their meals. Hosting an event at Ibiza is truly a great value for the space, quality of food, great service and ambiance. I would definitely come back here for dinner or another event. Excellent experience!"}
{"text":"As a lover of Tapas, I was excited to finally try Ibiza this past weekend.  All I can say was that it was a disappointment.  Between the 14 dollar per glass wine, the tiny amount of food delivered in comparison to other Tapas places I've been, and receiving the wrong food, being told by the person who brought out the food that it was the correct food, then when I very politely told the waiter I had the wrong food  - hearing the manager openly complain about it less than a few feet away- I'll never go back.  

I agree with those who stated poor service and save your money.  I had seen those reviews but figured I wanted to see for myself..at least, now I know.. Headkeeper in Greensburg is a little less in price, and a lot more in service and quality!"}
{"text":"Many of my experiences were mentioned by recent reviewers. So here are the bullet points

Pro: after seating us indoors due to no back patio seats being available, they let us move to the patio after people had left.

Cons:
-the food tasted like it was pre-canned, microwaved, or in various ways not fresh and not prepared for our meal
-we asked them to bring us each tapas plate as it was ready instead of all at once.... this would be a difficult request somewhere like a steak house or McDonald's..... but at a tapas place.... they should bring you the dishes as they are ready instead of 6 dishes at once.... so our bread was cold, our dip was warm, etc etc
-It took our food over 1 hour... yes 1 hour.... to arrive. Even though the restaurant was only half full. Indicating they were tremendously overwhelmed despite at only half capacity

So in a nutshell.... canned food served slowly. Not cheap enough to make it worth it.

Except they do advertise a $7 mussel buffet on Thursdays..... but beware since the mussels we were served were not really any good"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Ibiza for the first (and last) time. It's a nice looking space, but that's the last nice thing I have to say about it. We tried 4 tapas total, and found all of them underwhelming in flavor, and, in the case of the fried lamb chops, really bad. We both started with salads. I tried the marinated artichoke salad, and my husband had the grilled veggies. The veggies were probably the least offensive of the plates, as they were simply boring, and the artichokes had a weird flavor that I really could not describe or identify. I don't know what they use for a marinade, or if they open a can, or what, but they tasted bad. I love artichoke hearts, and I didn't even finish them. The salad greens were fine, and I liked the balsamic drizzle, but it appears on most of their plates, and that's not imaginative or interesting cooking by anyone's standards. I also ordered the tilapia ceviche with avocado. The ceviche was underseasoned, with little citrus and not enough salt, and had a weird bitter taste. The avocado was a slice served on the side, and I think they slice it ahead and leave it in a water and acid bath to keep it from browning, which had successfully leached it of any flavor whatsoever. The fried lamb chops were just as bad...an inferior, chewy chop with a bland crust and overly sweet sauce...yuck. When we sat down I ordered an amantillado sherry, and the server was stumped. Seems they don't offer a full line of sherries, so I went with the manzanilla, which I like just fine, but really??? A tapas bar with that limited a sherry offering? Come on, guys, get it together. The owner of this estalishment should bring all of his/her employees to Cafe Iberico in Chicago to learn what a real tapas bar has to offer."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with a group of 4 others. We had a reservation, and were seated promptly in the enclosed patio, with my back right up against a tower heater! But truth be told, it felt awfully good after the visit from the Polar Vortex we just experienced.There were no empty tables, and the bar seemed to be hopping, so they must be doing something right.

Though I had been to Mallorca several times, which I'd always been luke warm to, I had never experienced their sister, next-door restaurant, and was game when someone suggested it. With a group, we figured it be fun to go with the tapas. And choosing from the menu WAS fun. 

For the most part we stuck with the Tapas Calentas, or hot tapas, and shared everything. Each of us chose an item for the first round, and then another for the follow-up round. The grilled sardines with onions and peppers was quite good, reminding me to a lesser degree of those served in Lisbon. Since I'm watching my carbo intake, I avoided the mini crab cakes with blood orange, caramel and honey and the artichoke fritters with fresh garlic and olive oil. One of the nightly specials with shrimp in a chili lime sauce - good, but nothing special, which seemed to be the evening's theme. The fresh Prince Island black mussels in a provencal sauce was adequately sized for sharing, and were tender enough, but the sauce was somewhat nondescript. Sliced chorizo links were pleasantly spiced and oily as to be expected. My favorite of the night was a scallop dish, although as I'm looking at the menu I don't remember it being au gratin or with shrimp on a shish kabob. What struck a cord with me was how well they were heated, just enough to hold them together and heat them, but not enough so they chew like pea coat buttons. So rare in restaurants these days. The stuffed hot banana peppers with veal in tomato sauce were also good but, again, nothing to remember. The lone venture to the Tapas Frias (cold) side, we selected the Kobe beef tenderloin carpaccio in olive oil, which was quite tasty.

Though nothing was awful, and the service was perfectly acceptable, nothing stood out. I'd be back if I was meeting friends again, probably the best way to go to experience the most variety, but I wouldn't go out of my way for that \"must have\" dish that didn't occur."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! Nice tapas plates, nicely presented and in fairly good portions (for tapas).  Service was not the best I have experienced but still good enough.  Atmosphere depends on the day and time.  Sometimes you can be completely alone in the restaurant, which can make it a bit miserable.  In general though the setting is nice. The only disadvantage is that personally I think it is a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Valentines Day dinner with my wife.  Sure, the kitchen was backed up; sure, the weather was horrible; and those contributed to  the problems we encountered. But this was no doubt the worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  The main room was so cold; we relocated away from the door & still had to put our coats on to eat.  The wine flights were good, and fun, but we should have ordered more than just our soup while we had our waiter's attention.  My soup showed up in due time; my wife's arrived ~15 minutes later; it was the wrong soup.  We ordered tapas & entrée while the roaming spirit was among us; one tapas arrived several minutes later; the second arrived with our entrees. It all barely fit on our tiny table for two.  We ordered flan for dessert, and waited, and waited, and waited, and froze.  HOLY COW IT WAS COLD IN THERE!!  The flan finally arrived, with cream melted (it had obviously been sitting in wait).  I attempted to use a Visa gift card I'd received toward our bill. This totally baffled our waiter.  Multiple tries; supposed consultation with others on staff, but the gift card outwitted him. (We used it the next day someplace else without issue.)  I finally had him put he entire bill on my credit card, just so I get the hell out of there. A very frustrating evening!"}
{"text":"Ibiza is a real out of the ordinary treat.  They have a great wine list that features Portuguese and Spanish wines.  Their food is wonderful, I especially like the 2 cheese plates and the Tortilla Clasica de Patatas.  

Ibiza is owned by the restaurant next door, Mallorca.  I think their concept is to appeal to a little younger crowd and to be a little more stylish.  Personally, I think they succeed, because the ambiance is rather sophisticated and elegant. 

Make sure you take a look at their wine flights, I think they are a remarkable deal.

The service has always been very attentive polished.  Keep in mind you can use the lot next to Mallorca for $5 valet parking."}
{"text":"My first trip to Ibiza was a great success, so when I saw this spot on Groupon again, I had to snag one! I took my mom & dad last Wednesday night- they had never been. We were sat right away. I told my mom allllll about the wine flights, so we decided to split one. We ordered \"Flight #2\"- it was a white wine flight consisting of Salvemar Albarino, Ca'Donini Pinot Grigio, Santa Carolina Chardonnay & CK Mondavi Blonde 5. The chardonnay was my favorite last time & it was my favorite this time as well. We were pleased with the flight- $12 for 4 glasses of wine isn't bad. 

We were given bread to start. It was served with a VERY garlicy hummus. Dare I say it... the hummus was almost TOO garlicy for me & I NEVER say that about anything, I adore garlic. The bread was soft & delicious though. My mom ordered a Caesar salad without the anchovy's to start. She loved it- it was a decent portion & the dressing was light & the salad was fresh. 

One thing to note- there's a new menu. Only a couple weeks old. I wasn't prepared... I had just looked online & their old menu was still listed, so I had no idea what to order with the new menu. Our server was patient & helpful while I decided. We went with four items: the chicken spring roll, flat bread (with ham & pear), crab cakes & the garlic shrimp. As we waited, more people arrived & it was then that I noticed there was only one server working for all of the tables. I'm not sure if there was a call off or that is how they scheduled it, but it was obviously she was busy. There was also a bartender working, but for some reason she wasn't taking tables (although the bar was empty). 

Our food didn't take long, but it also did not arrive correctly the first time. The flatbread & chicken spring roll arrived, along with the crab cakes. We were also given spicy potatoes. I told our server that we didn't order the potatoes & she took them back without a problem & brought us the shrimp.

The flatbread- Unique, I had never had pears on a flatbread before. It was tasty- my mom & dad enjoyed it, but it didn't blow any of us away. 

The chicken spring roll- probably my favorite item of the evening. I wasn't too fond of the way it was cut- it wasn't practical for dipping, but it was really good. I wish they provided us with more chili sauce than the soy sauce though. The soy sauce on it's own was way too salty for the spring roll.

Crab cakes- I ordered these primarily for my dad. I don't really eat crab, but I decided that I should try them anyway. They were really good. The sauce that came with them went well with it. They weren't fishy & they clearly had a lot of crab in them. My dad liked them too, but again he wasn't blown away.

The garlic shrimp- This item came late to our table. As soon as she sat the shrimp down my family & I could smell a fishy smell... not what fresh shrimp should smell like. Despite the smell, we each decided to try one. They were tasteless. Literally. Which is a shame because it was one of my favorite items last time I came. I am NOT one to send food back... literally I have no idea when I last did so, but I didn't want us to pay $12 for shrimp we hated. I told our server we didn't like the shrimp & she took it off our bill without any issues.

While we were eating, the table next to us was sat & about 5 minutes later, they told the hostess they were leaving, considering they hadn't been greeted yet & felt as if the server was too busy. This was uncomfortable for me- I felt bad for the server, but also was overall confused as to why no one else was helping her with the tables.

Overall, I can see why this place gets such mixed reviews. I came here the first time & adored this place. The second time I came my experience was very different. My parents & I agreed that we probably won't return any time soon. It's a beautiful place with an awesome concept, but I think the management needs to step it up so that this place is more consistent."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try Ibiza and was excited when I saw them on Groupon. My friend who has been there told me that she liked the place, therefore, I got the Groupon and finally made it there with her last night. My friend and I showed them Groupon when they seated us and understood it did not apply to alcohol. The waiter confirmed with us that we could use Groupon for regular dishes and order happy hour tapas and drinks with reduced price. So we ordered a bottle of wine for Tuesday's happy hour special (which was half price, a good deal!) and two tapas from happy hour menu. We also ordered tapas, entree and desert from dinner menu.

When we asked for check, the waiter came to tell us that we could not use Groupon with happy hour special. We had to pay everything in full price if we wanted to use Groupon. We told him that we asked it specifically at the beginning and it was wrong that they told us it didn't apply at the end. We asked to talk to the manager who looked mean and unfriendly (I really don't want to say this but he was being a jerk). He said there was nothing he could do about it. Either we pay for it or the waiter has to pay for it. I can't believe that the manager put his customers in such position. The waiter was very nice to us and we didn't want to give him a hard time. However, it is not fair that they asked us to pay for everything in full (its about $40 difference). 

We didn't want to pick up a fight and usually I would just take it and pay for it.  But it is not right that he wants the waiter to pay. Not to mention how how he treated his customers. My friend tried to talk to the manger more and it took him a while to say ''I will think about it\" and walked away. The waiter came back later with a new check which responded Groupon promotion and happy hour special. We didn't know whether the waiter ended up paying but he obviously did not look happy.  

The food is good but some of the dishes are overpriced. I wouldn't go back without any promotion. I don't usually write bad reviews for restaurants but if you wanted to use Groupon, be aware of what you are going to order."}
{"text":"I was sorely disappointed by the menu change at Ibiza. Most of my favorites were taken away including the champagne flight. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Have eaten here several times but tonight was extra great. The eggplant with prosciutto & goat cheese was fantastic! A pitcher of white sangria for only $15..delicious! Chardonney with fruit..perfect summertime drink. Flan was amazing! Many extra touches. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Ibiza sounds great in concept but something just falls short here.  The wine selection is nice and some of the small dishes are solid but the service is lacking and the vibe is a bit average for what it is going for."}
{"text":"Can't say anything good about this place. Food is mediocre. Service is OK overall, but they messed up our order and failed to clean up the table to make room for more tapas. It also was incredibly loud inside, as it was nearly impossible to converse... and they don't take Discover.

EDIT: Had an opportunity to visit this place again, and this time around the expirience was a lot more pleasant. We went on a Monday night and the place was pretty dead, which was exactly what I was hoping for. The waitress was very friendly and we didn't have to wait long for our food or drinks. I still wasn't all that impressed by the food, but it wasn't bad at all... just avarage. All in one it was a nice relaxing dinner. I might come here again... in another year or so."}

{"text":"This used to be our favorite date night, but this will be our last visit. Service was great. She was brand new and very sweet and attentive. The food has gone downhill.
Papitas Bravas - I think they covered potatoes in Buffalo sauce. Disgusting! They would have been OK at a dive bar served w celery and bleu cheese. 
Ahi tuna on little wonton crackers- my tuna was stringy 
Bruschetta - did you add straight up sugar to the balsamic vinegar?? 
Grilled shrimp with some kind of creamy chili lime sauce. Meh 
So very disappointed. I used to LOVE this place."}
{"text":"How can a wine bar serve their wine in obsolete wine glasses. I guess if you're going to call yourself a wine bar you must have the proper glassware. The glass ware was cheap and cheap glassware ruins the wine.

Ok onto the food... I had beef carpaccio, this dish was very very good. I would go back and eat it again. I just wanted a snack before my movie so that is all I got. The place was very busy and seemed to be trendy.

I could see this place as a good date place."}
{"text":"Sat outside on their back patio. Beautiful ambience complete with a water wall and fairy lights. Food and wine were absolutely delicious. My favorites were the tilapia ceviche, goat cheese fritters, and bacon wrapped scallops. Enjoyed the Italian and Ibiza flights of wine and settled on the third of the Ibiza flight for a bottle. This was our second time there as a family of six, and all six of us would most certainly go again."}
{"text":"Overpriced, mediocre, lack of attention to detail and quality. Would not recommend. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Good wine and the food was great.  Cool atmosphere and close to all the Southside action.  I'm not a big tapas type but this spot is a go to and a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Neat little Tapas place on the South Side, Ibiza scores highly for its authentic fare but is setback by its high prices."}
{"text":"Having been to Spain a couple times I have a special place in my heart for Tapas, and overall Ibiza wasn't bad, but didn't meet my high expectations. 
First off, the bread they serve was great! I wanted to steal a loaf or two on my way out, but unfortunately the bread was arguably the best thing we ate all night. 
We had a variety of tapas, olives, bruscetta, tortilla de patatas, calamari, mushrooms, patatas bravas, scallops + shrimp to name a few. All pleasant enough, but nothing was outstanding. My favorite was the tortilla de patatas, a must have in my opinion, and a dish I remember seeing everywhere in Spain. If I do go back I'll be having this for sure. 
Ambiance was nice, and our server(s) were excellent, but probably because we were dropping so much dinero on our dinner. I think the price was a bit high for the food we were served.
Overall Ibiza is Good, not Great, and not a bargain, but if you do go don't just get one dish, order a variety of tapas and you just may find something you love!"}
{"text":"I think I prefer La Casa in Shadyside, but sometimes it's nice to have a change of scenery.

Ibiza is hipper (better located, more high-end ambiance, and, yours truly notwithstanding, trendier customers), but its food is not as satisfying as La Casa's. The proportion seemed just a tad off, leaving me feeling hungrier than a meal at La Casa with the same number of dishes. 

Bottom line: I think I just want a bigger bang for my buck."}
{"text":"For the most part we had a good experience. Portions are big if you are only sharing between two people. We ordered 5 plates but 4 would have been enough. With drinks it can get a little pricey, about $90-100 for two.

Fresh tomato and basil bruschetta -  Great
Stuffed hot banana peppers with veal - Good
Spicy garlic shrimp - Great
Spinach and Chorizo with Raisins and Pine Nuts - Great 
Four cheese lobster ravioli - Horrible (for $17 it should at least have some flavor)

Will I go again? Yes, but will not be my first choice as a place to spend 100bucks in."}
{"text":"I did a search for this restaurant as my first review here on Yelp.  I was shocked when I saw the average rating for this restaurant was 3 stars.  That certainly does not coincide with the experience that my wife and I had the night we visited.

We made reservations for 6pm that evening and upon arrival we were greeted with a very pleasant hostess that said we could sit at any free table we wanted.  Wasn't expecting that, but I liked it.

After a few minutes we received our menus and ordered our drinks, here is where they lost 1/2 a star for me.  The waiter began to spout off about 7 or 8 specials that were extremely involved.  While I like to have a choice when I got out, I do not like to feel like I have to memorize something just to order it.  After he was finished he went off to let us examine the menu.

This was my first time at a Tapas restaurant so I was not sure what to expect.  Upon examine the menu I was surprised at the variety that they had available.  They went from a simple plate of meat an cheese to some dishes that seemed as if they had 10+ ingredients to put them together.  

We decided that we would sample as much as we could without making ourselves sick.  We started with the meat and cheese plate that was garnished with calamata olives as well as some others that I've never seen before.  The various cheeses, salami and other salt cured meats were delicious.  The pairings that were chosen worked so well together we felt like ordering a second plate, but knowing how much we ordered we decided against it.

That plate was followed by a nice Ceviche that was garnished with purple onions and was presented in the traditional tower setting.  I believe this was dressed with a lemon vinaigrette with a dark balsamic glaze.  This was a fantastic following to the meat plate.  It cleansed the palate and prepared us for the next course.

Next up we both had an order of the tomato and mozzarella salad.  We should have taken the waiters advice on this one as it was one hell of a portion.  Ordering two of them was certainly a mistake.  Overall the plate was exactly what you would expect it to be.  Nothing really out of the ordinary here.  I would like to sample this dish when tomatoes are in season as the ones we were served were not as ripe as I would have liked, but all in all they went well with the mozzarella which was creamy and delicious.

I guess you can call the next two plates our main course.  One was 4 small lamb chops with a wasabi/nut crusting and the other was a plate of blackened scallops.  The lamb plate was cooked perfectly to our order specifications and was juicy and flavorful.  I personally did not prefer this as I don't particularly like the taste of wasabi, but my wife loved everything about it.  The scallops were flipped.  I absolutely loved them and my wife was unsure.  The blackened seasoning was just right.  Not to much and not overly burnt.  They were also cooked to perfection, not overly done like most places. 

For dessert we ordered a single serving of creme brulee.  This was delicious.  Nice and creamy with a firm but not burnt sugar crusting.  It tasted of vanilla and heavy cream and simply melted as soon as it hit your tongue.  I wish we would have ordered two....

To finish off our meal we both had what the waiter called a Spanish coffee.  It was a strong dark roast with some sort of alcohol, not sure what as i didn't ask nor did I care.   The drink was delicious for me as I love the bitterness of black coffee.  My wife is more of a flavored latte type of person, so I offered to drink hers, which she accepted.

I forgot to mention why I subtracted the other 1/2 star.  
For some odd reason they felt the need to swap waiters half way into our dinner.  This caused some confusion about drink refills amongst other minor details.  I just can't understand why they thought it would be a good idea to do this.  I understand that each waiter should have their sections, but wait until the meal is complete before yo subtract that table from your section.

Overall we were both very satisfied and we will be returning to select some other interesting items from the menu.  Not sure when, but we will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Ibiza several times and have always had a good experience. Most recently, I attended a birthday party for a friend in the upstairs, private room. The service was good, the food was good, the drinks were good. Everything was reasonable priced. The thing that really does the trick for me is the valet. Being a single gal, arriving alone to a restaurant after dark on the southside is sometimes frustrating since I may have to park several blocks away from my final destination. While I am by no means nervous while wondering around the city, I know that it is not the safest thing to do, parking streets away from Carson and having to walk in high heels, carrying a purse, cellphone, and car keys. The valet makes life easier. I don't have to roam around, looking for parking-which is one of the reasons I tend to avoid the Southside all together. 

The only complaint I have, is the \"party room\" upstairs. There was a 20 person minimum to get the room, but it is a teeny-tiny room, especially when you consider that we known one another and want to mingle with one another. There was one large table, and several 2 or 4 person tables. It all felt very cramped and the smaller tables were cramped, considering this is the type of place where you order small plates to share with your table. It just all felt tight. I understand that we ended up having more than 20 people there, which made it feel even more tight, but I think a 20 person minimum for such a small room seems a bit ridiculous. 

That being said, it is nice that they even have a private room for such occasions and we had a great time. Call ahead of time for details on reserving the private room and be careful wearing super high heels if you choose to use the upstairs room...I almost took a spill on the slippery steps-could have been tragic. CLASSY."}
{"text":"This place is not worth your time or money 
Tapas pretty so so and service just ok. 
The place not great ambiance and walls need painting 
Overall I would not visit this place again."}
{"text":"had the scallops-mushroom bruschetta and tilapia ceviche tapas. it was all pretty darned good. would come again. ps. great wine selection. ."}
{"text":"Our waiter here was excellent, did a good job explaining the 'tapas' style ordering to us and checking up on us.  The overall tastes in the food were good and portions perfect.  There were lots of interesting combinations of foods and flavors, I felt really full after only a salad and a couple split tapas plates due to the multiple flavors that seemed to just satisfy each section of my palate.

We went in June and sat outside, which I would not recommend.  The ventilation out there is horrific.  It was easily 15-20 degrees warmer in the covered patio than it was outside, and the fans are hung way too high to make a difference.  It was really an uncomfortably sweaty dinner.

My biggest complaint though, which will result in me never going there again, is the cheapness of the owner.  I went with a group of 4 with one Groupon ($25 Groupon which I paid $12 for).  A group of 4 in this restaurant will easily spend over $100, and we all ordered wine as well.  The owner would NOT honor the \"buy one get one half off\" wine flight special of the day because we had a Groupon.  To tell us that he was unwilling to give the $8 off for the half price wine flight, when we were already going to spend well over $100 on dinner is just ABSURD.  An owner who doesn't try to appease their guests, and pinches pennies to that degree (it was $15 for the wine flight... so we just wanted the second for $7.50), is NEVER going to get my repeat business.   I've used probably 30 Groupons over the last 1-2 years and never have I had a ridiculous rule like this- or the rules were at least stated at time of purchase on the Groupon site.  Maye they should just consider making a \"Groupon customer\" menu without the specials listed so we don't know we're being jipped.  

I support small businesses that care about their customers, and have had other restaurants accept a Groupon and an Entertainment book coupon with the same check.  Never again will I support such an uncaringly cheap owner."}
{"text":"You need to know what to get at Ibiza. We have been impressed with their hot tapas, but no so much with their cold ones. The scallops are always a good choice and so is the grape salad when they have it. We had ried the fried artichoke, which was also very good. The olives have been a mix, sometimes good, sometimes OK. I would stay away from the octopus (I am a big octopus fan, but theirs did not seem fresh). 

They have a very good wine selection, but some wines do not seem to be in stock, although they are on the menu. 

Ambience is very nice outside; they have covered outside seating. In the bar area, it can get noisy. 

Service has always been very good to OK with us. Never had a problem."}
{"text":"Awesome tapas restaurant! 

I came here with my friend while visiting Pittsburgh for a nice dinner on one of my last night there. Being a HUGE fan of tapas, I was excited to try some new dishes that are not offered at my local joints I regularly attend. 

We came on a Friday night to find the place crazy busy! Good thing I made reservations! 

We were promptly sat right at our reservation time at a nice table in the front right by the window. Our service was immediate and our waiter was very friendly and accommodating to our questions about the different tapas on the menu. 

I ended up order the fillet medallions and the seared sea scallops with the mango salsa. My friend had what looked to be the most delicious salad ever sculpted and some other vegetarian fare that she was into. My entrees were both out of this world! The fillets were cooked perfectly and had that melt in your mouth texture that I love! The sea scallops were also great with the mango salsa which surprisingly paired really well! 

We each ordered a wine flight and split a bottle of wine during dinner! The wine selection was very extensive and the flights were also moderately priced! 

I would definitely give this place another go the next time I am visiting and craving some delicious tapas!"}
{"text":"We had ladies night at Ibiza last Friday and it was SO fun! The service was fast and friendly, the owner (?) came around multiple times to thank us for coming in, the food was delicious and fun, and the Sangria pitchers were flowing! The patio out back is open right now but it's a covered patio with heat lamps--would actually be really fun/romantic for a date! We ate the calamari which was delicious, the mushroom bruschetta, the chimichurri meat plate, and the lobster ravioli. Four of us split all of that tapas-style and it was more than enough food. Everything was delicious-- I will definitely be going back!

Pros:
+Service
+Food value/taste (calamari/meat plate was the best!)
+Sangria pitchers are a pretty good deal 
+atmosphere
+Tapas -- good for sharing and trying multiple things

Cons:
I can't think of any! Parking maybe? It's right on Carson street but they have valet for $5"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Was blaring crap 90's trash-pop. Fruit flies everywhere. 

Some of the dishes were aiighhht but at tapas prices you expect perfection. Menu is too big.

Next."}
{"text":"I have been going to Ibiza for years now. Service has always been fantastic. Food has always been fantastic. Ibiza specializes in tapas dishes. They have a wide variety of dishes of different meats, fish, and non-meat. Very large wine list. My only complaint is a dinner can get very expensive quick as you add multiple plates and drinks. They also participate in Restaurant.com and deal websites frequently. Restaurant.com is the best deal. Make sure to get a voucher first before dining. 

Some of my favorite plates are:
- Bacon Wrapped Scallops 
- Spinach and Chorizo with Raisins and pine nuts
- Seared Tuna
- Stuffed Hot Banana Peppers With Veal
- Filet mignon medallion with mushroom sauce
- Lobster Ravioli"}
{"text":"Nice decor, poor service and the food is over-priced and poorly executed. We were here with a party of 5 and nothing was exceptional. One tapas dish was really fishy. A few not bad. Main dishes were skimpy with no attention to quality and presentation. I do not recommend Ibiza at all. A waste of money."}
{"text":"It was really just barely okay. The descriptions of the food sound heavenly...chili and lime shrimp, grilled scallops with mango salsa, etc. The presentation is nice. But the flavors were really lacking. The food was definitely overpriced; we got 4 pieces of shrimp for something like $14. Our scallops were undercooked. 

The servers were very friendly, polite, and attentive. The decor is definitely striking and beautiful. I think I would come back if I were looking for a trendy place to drink. But the food won't get me back in the door, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Not really worth the money. Poor Luke our waiter was phenomenal and took full responsibility for the chefs bad cooking! Cold pork 2x's. Food and experience fell short of great! If you want a late night nosh go home and open a bag of Doritos..you are better off."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this place tonight. 
Sangria was great - get the pitcher it's about same price as two glasses. 
My date and I enjoyed sharing several tapas items; scallops were perfectly cooked and wonderful, medium rare medallion with mushrooms was very tasty and also perfectly cooked, stuffed peppers were spicy and great, tilapia item was very good also. 
My least favorite item was the sushi grade tuna on some kind of chips - it was good but not outstanding like the other items. 
The chocolate mouse shared with an expresso and a coffee topped off the evening. 
I will certainly be back again ;)
Nice valet parking right next door was a plus!"}
{"text":"Good variety of tapas but a little bit more expensive than other tapas places I've been. Would go back though. The hot banana peppers stuffed with veal were way too hot."}
{"text":"After 2 weeks in Pittsburgh (Relo from Chicago) my wife and I were looking for low-key night out.   The place is actually really nice and has nice ambiance but the food fell way short of expectations.   Simply put..... this place is a JOKE. 

No need to get into specifics - the food was just pain BAD! The staff was very nice and accommodating and they have a great wine selection.  Problem is  - they try to produce food that is way out of their current cooking staffs league.   

The specials of the night sounded awesome when described but here is the real deal.  Spicy shrimp (described as large jumbo shrimp served in a spicy but delicate sauce) was 4 small shrimp served with watered down cocktail sauce and a hint of tabasco.  Seafood shu-mai (special tapas of the night - described as a refreshing cirtus delight) was straight from the freezer , deep-fried and served in a soy sauce/oj mixture.   Calamari (which is usually grilled in garlic/butter/olive oil) was fried and served with some sort of thousand island/olive oil sauce.   Seafood platter - which was the worst attempt at paella I have ever seen, was the most flavorful dish we had but all the seafood was overcooked.   If I wanted fried food - I would have gone to a bar!

Please please please.... don't waste your time/money at this place as it falls way short of what they are trying to be.  Go for the wine/drinks and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I give credit where credit is due. Ibiza offers unique food options(even though they are over-priced.) The bread and hummus provided appetizer is a nice start, definitely a one-up on traditional bread and butter. I attended a graduation party on their outdoor patio in 2009. In my visits since then, I have been pleased with the service and food selection. 

All good things must come to an end? I found this saying to be nothing short of the truth, due to my most recent experience at Ibiza. Back in May, I went to Ibiza for an 8pm, Monday(slow night for them) dinner, and had the worst dining experience of my life. 

Before I go any further...a tid bit of background information of my restaurant experience. Throughout high school and college, I worked as a waitress. That's eight solid years, folks. I worked at upscale restaurants and business clubs, serving the same type of clientele you would see at Ibiza. I know proper restaurant etiquette. 

That said, my three friends and I were rudely greeted by the host. He gave us that judgemental 'up and down' look like we didn't belong there. (Sidenote: we were all wearing appropriate dresses and heels.) Two of my friends had certificates to redeem. We knew the certificate rules...we couldn't sit together. We politely asked to sit at two, two top tables near each other since the restaurant was EMPTY. Sitting seperate would avoid ripping them off since we would order food and tip separate. I know how important tipping is, ripping them off wasn't even a thought in my mind. 

The host told us \"no, it is against our rules.\" No further explanation, no apology, nothing. We tried to explain our position and asked why they would sit us across the room from each other in an empty restaurant?! He kept repeating \"those are our rules.\" He promptly left, leaving us to stand up front for 6 minutes (yes, I timed it.) So unprofessional!! The manager finally came to greet us, but he was also extremely rude and told us we could follow their rules or leave. He also did not offer an apology or explanation. My friends and I were baffled and I was ready to leave. My friends convinced me to stay so they could use up their certificates. Two of us sat at the bar and the other two were seated CLEAR across the EMPTY room from us. We didn't share food or any other infringment that would have 'ripped them off.' Ugh, Ibiza....rude rude rude. 

Restaurants are in business because they please customers. Every waitress job I had, we did EVERYTHING in our power to please the customer. Ibiza, you have failed...miserably. No second chances, no more good reviews."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a lovely night here on our 3 yr anniversary. We had reservations, but showed up earlier, and they had no problem seating us. We sat on the patio and it was a wonderful atmosphere! The lighting, fountains and spanish music really set the mood. I love that their bread basket was served with hummus, every restaurant should do that! 

They had a great wine list and we settled on a Spanish bottle. Worth it to get the bottle instead of paying by the glass. The tapas we got were the smoked salmon and asparagus, the salmon tartar and the mushroom bruschetta. They were all really yummy, but the mushroom bruschetta was my favorite! Marinated-to-perfection portobellos oozing over toasted bread. So delicious. The salmon dishes also were very good. You will definitely fill up on bread here, so watch out! I was so full... My boyfriend also ordered the fried calamari (I don't like calamari) but it came out as a huge portion in a basket, which was odd since everything else was smaller portions and presented delicately. He said it wasn't very good...

The waiter was helpful and I would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"The food was very overpriced, especially for a tapas bar. The sardines were not very good, and difficult to pick through all the bones. Also, I'd like to see more vegetarian options on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night just to sit at the bar with a friend. Can't complain about much, though really this is just a review for the bar and not a review on the food since I didn't have any. There were about 10 seats at the bar, the bar tender was pretty friendly and joked with us. We had a few different types of wines - they offer wine flights which are nice, or you can go by the glass. They also have a special, at least on Saturday night, for $5 sangria or mango or strawberry margaritas. My friend had those and said they were pretty good!"}
{"text":"Went here on an anniversary with my bf. Great date place.  Waitstaff was friendly and offered good suggestions.  Best dish I had was the banana peppers stuffed with veal.  Fried calamari lacking...."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Ibiza and I have to say it was a pleasant experience and I would definitely return! We had a group of 6 and I do recommend reservations. They have dining, bar and patio seating as well as a private room. Tapas are small dishes like appetizers that you can share with everyone. It is fun because you get to try some of everything. Service was fast and very friendly. I recommend a pitcher of the Sangria which can be shared with your whole party. We actually went through 4 pitchers with 6 people. Obviously the sangria isn't very strong but very tasty! 

We tried the eggplant stuffed with goat cheese and ham which was very good although I thought the ratio of goat cheese to ham and eggplant was off with more goat cheese than I would have like. The calamari and artichoke tapas were delicious as well as the mushroom risotto (and I don't even like mushrooms!). My husband agreed that the chili lime shrimp was by far our favorite tapas as the shrimp was grilled perfectly and the sauce had just the right balance of chili and lime. Everyone at our table raved about the chorizo with spinach and raisins too. 

Overall, my experience at Ibizo was satisfying and I will certainly return. I can see why other people are saying they spent a lot of money or left hungry because the dishes are small. However, that's the point! They are meant to be shared and if you're still hungry, you can order more because the service is fast. Only giving it 4 stars because we felt some of the dishes were lacking in salt. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Review Date: 08/15/2009

    My wife and I ate here last night and were really disappointed in the food. It's a nice looking place and the menu and service were ok. The house serves a small baguette and a ramekin of humus. The bread was average and the humus only tasted of garlic. Should have tasted of chickpeas with notes of garlic, it was heavy and cloying.
    I ordered the roasted veg salad and the rack of lamb. The veg salad should really have been a tapas, not a large bowl of lettuce with some vegetables in it. The vegetables were bland and underseasoned and the balsamic dressing missed the mark entirely. This should have been a small plate of grilled vegetables redolent with sea salt and pepper and dressed in a fruity Spanish olive oil. We should have been offered fresh ground pepper with our salads, it would have helped them a little. The rack of lamb was 2 chops (not a rack) and they were deep fried. We couldn't taste the lamb under the terrible taste of the deep fryer and mystery batter. The sauce on the plate was bitter and the couscous was entirely forgettable. This dish was almost inedible.
    My wife had the artichoke salad. Again, a huge plate of greens with a dozen artichoke hearts that had a terrible aftertaste. We both tried them and couldn't eat them. She followed with the ceviche. I had hoped it would taste of the ocean. Briny and just a little salty with bright acid tones and maybe a little green chili. This was as bland as you can imagine. The textures were good but the dish had very little flavor. I did catch a bitter lime note, we tried salting the dish and it was a little better but entirely forgettable at best.
    Another second rate Pittsburgh restaurant. The owners would be served to import some chefs and maybe leave the area to try some better food to see what it tastes like before serving us this terrible excuse for a meal. My wife and I have over 25 years in combined food service experience."}
{"text":"Went here on a Tuesday night due to Groupon purchase with a party of 4. It was a slow evening but I was still surprised of how the restaurant filled up by the end of our meal. I reserved beforehand and we were brought to our table promptly.

The waiter took awhile to get to us but he was very nice. He probably also needed some presentation lessons of the menu but we didn't really care. The atmosphere was lovely too. The party of four ordered:

Fresh Grilled Veggie Salad (so-so, sauce was good)

Green salad with goat cheese and hazelnut (cheese was good; they just wanted some veggies)

Fresh mushroom bruschetta (I expected more from this, it was so-so)

Fresh salmon tartar with capers (I'm a big fan of tartar, and this was delicious)

Traditional Spanish ham fritters (a big surprised - it was pretty good!)

Classic Spanish potato and onion omelet (the sauce that came with it was heavenly)

Spanish Sausage with potatoes (this was one of my favorite dishes! I thought it was be just mediocre, but it surprised me in everyway!)

Beef shish kabob ala parrilla with onions and peppers (it was okay, only one stick so i wasn't too impressed)

Filet mignon medallion with mushroom sauce (DEFINITELY get this! We got it cooked at medium and it was perfect!)

and the Chocolate coffee layered cake (contrary to what others said, this was also really good! Not too sweet, it was gone within seconds - loved it!)

SO, what I would recommend: salmon tartar, ham fritters, spanish sausage with potatoes, filet mignon, and chocolate coffee layered cake. 

I would come again if I crave tapas!"}
{"text":"We went here on a groupon, on a Wednesday evening.  The main restaurant was fairly empty, and a little worn-down.  We were offered a table on the heated, covered patio, but declined because it was pouring down rain and 45 degrees outside.  Some of the dishes lacked subtlety.  I had the Portuguese seafood platter, which was good, but a heavy saffron flavor predominated the dish.  However, the stuffed hot banana peppers with veal in tomato sauce were incredible.  My dinning companion had a salad special with grilled grapes and goat cheese.  Again, this was good, but the grapes were a little over-powering.   Before leaving, we checked out the patio, and then regretted our choice to eat inside.  In order to get to the patio, you walk past the exciting, open kitchen.  Once outside, we found an intimate, surprisingly warm and cozy space (on an otherwise cold and rainy evening), filled with patrons.  I will return, and definitely look forward to the patio experience."}
{"text":"Didn't see a review about the Thursday special of AYCE mussels on here, so I went out to try it.

NOT GOOD. Terrible. Don't get it. They're serving either really old and rotten mussels that they don't even clean. 75% were undercooked, with the mussels still sticking to the shell.

Otherwise the interior is nicely decorated. The cheese/fruit tapas was good, and so was the bread with the chocolate butter.

But really they should stop advertising that special."}
{"text":"My friend Valerie and I tend to bring out the food-snob in each other. Personally, I was just excited for my upcoming trip to Barcelona but she's also a self professed foodie who doesn't mind spending the money if it means we're going to eat well. 
It didn't hurt that I had a $25 off $50 coupon restaurant.com coupon either ;)

Because we have the weirdest schedules we ended up at Ibiza at 4:10, ten minutes after it had opened. We were the only ones and consequently, our server was really attentive and spent his time outlining the specials for us. I think he was a foodie too...the way he described everything made me want to order one of everything!

The menu itself doesn't wax as persuasive but again our server was more than happy to recommend the lamb chops in a sweet teriyaki, covered in crushed wasabi peas. 
Feeling hungry, we focused on meat dishes and also ordered grilled sea scallops in a pomegranate sauce, salmon carpaccio, and towards the end, chorizo with spinach, raisins, and pine nuts. 

I don't know if i'd order the carpaccio again. It was super small but at least it was sprinkled with lots of capers that popped freshly in your mouth. 
Next came the lamb...i couldn't stop dipping into the sauce! It was also hard to decide how we were going to split the portion since the plate was presented with 3 chops. 
This happened with the scallops too...3 large, glistening scallops grilled nicely. My only comment would be that I would not have known it was a pomegranate sauce if the menu hadn't listed it as such. 

We were still hungry at this point and Valerie for some reason had NEVER HAD CHORIZO BEFORE. Ibiza's chorizo was cut in sausage slices- not the ground meat I was expecting. The spinach was cooked down into soft leaves of green atop pine nuts and sweet raisins that almost got me to overlook how oily the chorizo was. I guess that's to be expected but at the same time, it's not the most appetizing thing to see when your plate is coated neon orange. 

I would definitely come back. It's nice when you're able to stop yourself from overeating as I sometimes, regrettably find myself doing. I am definitely looking forward to tapas in Spain! 

My recommendation would be to come in a group of 3. (Maybe with the girls for wine!) Most of the dishes seemed to be served in triplets."}
{"text":"I expect a wine bar to at least have good wine, if nothing else, but the wine at Ibiza that my dining companion and I had was terrible. JUST TERRIBLE. This isn't an \"oh, we had a bad glass\" sort of terrible either because each of us had a flight with 4-5 wines in it and didn't like any of them. There was also a dishwashing film on several of the glasses, which may be okay in an Olive Garden or something, but not at a self-proclaimed wine bar. We had intended to eat, but after trying two tapas (chicken satay and bruschetta) and being underwhelmed by the taste and portioning for the price ($$$), we decided that it was probably best to not stay for dinner. That's the beauty of the Southside-- if you don't like where you are, there are tons of other choices just a stone's throw away. 

The staff was fairly rude-- especially the hostess-- with the exception of our server who was pleasant, but clueless about the menu and kept disappearing and coming back smelling like cigarette smoke (when we left he was actually posted up at the front door smoking). I liked the ambiance and decoration of the restaurant, but was sorely disappointed with the wine and food for the price. A few slices of bread for $10 with wine that tastes spoiled? Count me out. I see that this restaurant is now offering groupon and living social deals to try to attract business (I paid full price on my visit). Let it be know that I would not return to Ibiza, even with a deal."}
{"text":"The food was good, however I don't appreciate shady establishments and will not be going back.  There are plenty of places that are honest and treat customers better.  There was a discrepency on our bill (I won't go into too many details) but they tried to \"up charge\" us on two menu items thinking we wouldn't catch it but we did.  This seems to be a common practice because there was actually an item listed as \"up charge\" on the itemized bill.  Bush league."}
{"text":"When I made our reservation, I spoke with the GM and requested a tasting menu with pairings.  He didn't seem to know what I was talking about, but asked me to call back in a couple of days.  When I did, he said that he had spoken with his chef and that we were good to go.

We were served six or seven courses, with a glass of wine to match each one.  The food was mostly well made, although the meal seemed a little heavy on the meat.  While it seemed like they weren't used to a request like this, they were ultimately successful and we were very satisfied.

The wines were well selected, and the almond liqueur digestif was a nice touch.

The service was quite good.  The GM was very interested in us (and the other diners in the room) having a good experience."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say that this place has really gone down hill and I don't see myself coming back. I had been here many times in the past, loved the regional wine flights and the many many tapas choices. They are now gone. The wine menu has been canabalized with pages ripped and torn out. The tapas menu is now one page. The waitress couldnt find the bottle of wine that we ordered. There was only one waitress for the whole restaurant. The back patio was closed. Quite honestly this place looked like it was in the process of closing. So many other places to go. Antonio has really let this place slip."}
{"text":"things that keep me coming back for more, despite my budget: cheese & cured meat platter.  artichoke fritters.  quail in red wine reduction (served on a bed of delightful crispy potatoey stick-tangles).

and biggest draw of all: BEST MARINATED OLIVES. EVER.  hands down.  I don't even LIKE olives.  sometimes I stop here to get an order of olives to go.  they're outstanding.

And their sangria might be the best you'll ever have.  dead serious.  pay the high price for that pitcher at least once.  you have to try it."}
{"text":"A girls night began as a joint celebration for a divorce and birthday, who knew it would also be a celebration of tastes. Add to the delish food our knowledgeable and attentive, yet not pushy, service by Wendy and our night was complete.  Tuna and scallops were beyond expectations. You cannot go wrong with Ibiza!"}
{"text":"This is our top rated place to go! A great hotspot with vibrant crowd and good food. This place is great for vegetarians and the sangria is IMHO the best in Pitt. The marinated olives and mushroom bruschetta are excellent. If you long for some spice and flavor, try the patatas bravas! Don't forget to grab the regular groupon offers for this place. Also, the experience gets better with a prior reservation!"}
{"text":"I have to preface this review by stating that we visited Ibiza for Pittsburgh Restaurant Week - so I *should* go back and actually eat a long, leisurely tapas meal - however, I'm not so sure it's worth it. For PRW, we had:

--Starters - fresh tomato and basil bruschetta; artichoke fritters with fresh garlic and olive oil
--Entrees - 8 oz grilled filet with red wine reduction; lobster ravioli with vodka sauce
--Desserts - flan and chocolate mousse

The bruschetta was awful - dry, cold, hard bread with mushy flavorless tomatoes. The fritters were perfect though - beautiful crunchy crust encapsulating a nice briny artichoke heart. I do feel that there was a missed opportunity for the fritters to have some kind of condiment or sauce with them.

My filet had excellent seasoning and nice grill marks and flavors but was unevenly cooked - half medium rare and half extremely rare (I had asked for medium). The \"red wine reduction\" was a watery, oniony mess. The potatoes and artichoke had a good sear on them but were bland with no seasoning whatsoever - not even salt. My husband's lobster ravioli was good, as was the vodka sauce, but not memorable or unique in any way.

The flan was a bit - how should I say - chewy/like plastic and was swimming in what was supposed to be a cinnamon honey sauce I think. The mousse had the consistency of a half-cooked brownie and had a weird white chocolate glaze that totally missed the mark.

Overall, slow service, an unremarkable wine list, and below-average food made me sad to have wasted a #PRW meal by visiting Ibiza."}
{"text":"Ok we know you can roll your rrrrr's... Any chance you can take it down a notch so I can actually understand you..

I was so confused.. So many waiters for my table of 4.. Were you just trying to talk to pretty girls or what?

One of the waiters kept questioning me not drinking.. Luckily I am pregnant and not a recovering alcoholic..

Food was ehh ok.. Not good enough to go back..

If you want your bills split let them know way ahead of time.. They were so confused and then put 4 bills in 2 check holders which was awkward.. Good thing we we're all friends.. And yes I will need change for my $100 bill on my $30 check"}
{"text":"Great place to go on a date! 

We ordered the tomato soup, chef's salad, mushroom bruschetta, regular bruschetta, beef skewer, and spicy potatoes. All were good but the ones we couldn't stop talking about were the mushroom bruschetta and spicy potatoes. 

The wine was also really good. The service was excellent. Our server was friendly and checked on us frequently. She also seemed to know the menu really well. 

I would def recommend this place to anyone that's looking for something a little different and a little fancy. Be sure to ask for the spicy potatoes! They're not always on the menu but if you ask the chef will make them for you. Trust me, you will thank me!"}
{"text":"Went here about 2 wks ago and had a healthy selection of tapas.  We had the lamb special, the filet mignon, the ceviche, the calamari, and the quail.  The food wasn't bad but nothing to get excited over.  All in all the only one that left me yearning for more was the lamb special.  They have a very nice atmosphere and attentive staff.  That goes along way with me, but wasn't that impressed with the food so that's why I had to give it a 3."}
{"text":"The place was packed when we showed up an we had to wait a little bit for our reservation. I will give the benefit of the doubt being it was a Saturday. Once we were seated the service was great! Our tapas were amazing. The lamb chops were a little over cooked but overall everything was delicious!! I will totally come here again; especially in the spri ad summer to enjoy the outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd trip to Ibiza. It has great decor and we really like tapas, so we decided to try it again. The first time we were VERY disappointed, the waiter was not good and the food was actually bad. So thinking we must have just ordered the wrong things we went back. The waiter this time was excellent. Unfortunately the food still horrible. The best thing about the meal was the free bread. I do not recommend this place at all, it is expensive and the food is not good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh. Definitely order the mussels and lamb. Wine flights are good too."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a Friday night recently and were surprised by how empty it was! I hadn't been here since they redid their menu and I had heard some negative feedback about it, so I decided to check it out myself.  I didn't feel that the changes to their menu were bad at all! My friend and I each ordered a flight of wine for a respectable price I thought.  We also ordered a beet salad, crab cakes, and stuffed peppers. All of which were very flavorful and presented very nicely.  For dessert, I had the chocolate creme brûlée and my friend ordered the cheesecake, but I liked the cheesecake she ordered way better than my creme brûlée.  Our waiter was exceptional.  He was not only very pleasant, but he was helpful and knowledgable in navigating the new menu and constantly clearing the plates off of our table.  I'm not sure what all the criticism was about, it is very likely that I will dine here again (especially considering that they are constantly offering deals on groupon, restaurant.com, and living social)."}
{"text":"Bottom line: save your money.
$16 for 2 scallops?! $14 for 4 medium sized shrimp?! Never again. I took my husband and parents here for a treat but ended up shelling out several times what I would have at any other sit-down restaurant. I don't recommend this place at all. The service was relatively quick but our waitress was really pushy and seemed like she only cared if we ordered the highest price things. The ambiance was okay but crowded. The free valet parking was a perk and gives it 1 star on its own b/c that was really convenient. The other 1 star is for the host on the phone who quickly changed our reservation last minute and made me feel welcome. 

The waitstaff? Could improve. The food? Taste was only okay. All 4 of us could have starved if not for the 3 refills of bread and I ordered 6 plates of tapas for everyone. You can imagine my ginormous bill...I also tipped 20% and should have only done 10% for the actual service. Vast improvement needed."}
{"text":"Portion sizes are really big for tapas.  We weren't aware of the size, and after we ordered the waiter didn't let us know it was too much.  We ordered a bunch of plates and liked half of them.   Wine bottles were 1/2 off, so that was a bonus.  These are some of the things we ordered.

Atun espegado service sobre wonton chips.  Spicy tuna over wonton. The sauce was really good.  The tuna was ok, not great.  
We had the meat and cheese appetizer. It was really good.  A bunch of different meats and cheeses and they were all tasty.  
We had a scallop and shrimp skewer. The seafood was overcooked. 
We had a potato dish that was supposed to be traditional but it was potatoes cooked in Tabasco.  Not great, unless your a fan of Tabasco.

Overall the experience was ok.  The staff was really friendly.  I really enjoy tapas, and this just didn't quite give me what I had expected."}
{"text":"Really wanted to give this place a try so came here with my friends and family. Group of 9 people. Have to say they were very accommodating for our party. Cons: service. Our waitress forgot to submit my order so I watched as my table ate and when I asked about my mussels she said I'll go check and then came back and said 10 more minutes (they forgot). She didn't apologize or try to remedy the situation. Poor customer service to the max. The drinks are good, the ambiance is good, and the bartenders are attentive. Our waitress ruined our experience and I get it, it's not easy to be a server but you're in the service industry so get the part of service down pat. Would I come back? Who knows but if I do, it wouldn't be for awhile."}
{"text":"I wouldn't highly recommend Ibiza. They definitely have a good selection of tapas and drinks, but they aren't the best quality. We ordered a variety of tapas including the calamari, mushroom brushetta, spinach and artichoke dip, and the omelette. The omelette and calamari were good and large tapas. However, the mushroom brushetta was way too salty, and the mushrooms tasted like they were canned. Also, the drinks weren't expensive, but they were not the best. The mango margarita had more of a smoothie consistency, and the sangria tasted super watery."}
{"text":"Great experience at Ibiza,which is an authentic Spanish ,Portuguese restaurant..the clams were the best I've had in Pittsburgh and were very fresh.everything we ordered was great and the service was great.
They use food purveyors from New York and New Jersey that's why the food is authentic.  Some Pittsburgh palates might not be used to that
The staff was very knowledgable about the menu,and yes tapas are small portions"}
{"text":"Everyone who gave a poor rating was telling you the truth.  I do not recommend this place.  I read the reviews but had to go here for a birthday dinner.  The valet was $5.  Not free. Inexpensive but not free as advertised on their website.  The bathrooms were filthy.

We were seated on the first floor and it was mosquito and fly heaven.  Bring bug spray! The server we had got a lot of orders wrong.  The server had to come back countless times to double check if he got our orders correctly.  Ex: he came around to ask if my friend ordered mushroom bruschetta or mushroom risotto.  She said risotto.  I know bc when he came back to give her a plate of mushroom bruschetta, I said \"didn't you get risotto?\"  She even pointed to her menu when he took the order to make sure he knew, but maybe he forgot or didn't pay attention.

For my entree, I ordered the grilled ahi tuna with soy aioli.  He came back 5 mins after taking the order to ask how I wanted it cooked.  Minutes later, a plate of argentianian meats came out.  I was like \"I ordered fish,\" so he apologizes and then brings out a plate of tuna with wontons.  Wrong dish again.  It took 3 tries, 2 wrong dishes and 2 servers to get my grilled tuna.  I was lucky/unlucky that my husband and friends shared their tapas with me.

The food was probably one of, if not, the worst food I've ever had at a restaurant.  After trying out 8 different things, I only liked my friend's mushroom risotto.  The shrimp was ok (although a little fishy). The scallop was good (bc I love scallops), but the mango sauce it came with was just ok.  Another friend said she liked the gnocchi, and one of the guys liked the chorizo.  Other than that, everything was just \"eh\" esp for the price.  Nothing special.  

My hubby and I love mussels but definitely not from here.  They were dirty!  The shells had barnacles and the mussels had sand and grit.  You're supposed to brush and clean them before cooking.  Isn't that cooking 101?  Gross!

My hubby and I paid about $95 plus 20% tip.  We wouldn't mind if the food and service were phenomenal, even if it was just good.

The sangria they highly recommended was diluted.  All ice. A pitcher was $25.

Do yourself a favor and stay away from here."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Definitely do not recommend coming here. The service is terrible and they do not have everything on the menu. I came here with friends and everyone was disappointed. I lived in Barcelona for 2 years and The food does not taste like anything from Spain. 
They do not have anything for vegetarians either.  The food tasted cheap and salty.
The prices were outrageous. 
The potato bravos were not like the Spanish ones. Nothing in this place was. 
I give this place a F and will not go back. 
Also, do not fall for their groupons, you will end up paying for more then you intended!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the portions are definitely on the small side of the scale. I got a groupon for it so it wasn't bad at all. I definitely recommend the stuffed hot peppers with veal. It comes in 3 and it's great for sharing. Very tasty. The sauce can't go to waste! Use some bread and dip away :) They had a trout salad that day as well and since I like fish, I got it. It was also pretty yummy. I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times now, and with the exception of one time, my experiences have been good. During the bad visit, the scallops were sandy, which can really ruin a meal, but they handled it very well, immediately replacing the dish with another and comping some of the dishes. I don't blame the restaurant for this mistake, since I have had the scallops many times in the past and until then, they were consistently good, and Ibiza handled the situation very well.

The staff is relatively knowledgeable about the menu and can provide great recommendations. I definitely prefer the hot tapas over the cold, and I don't think you can go wrong when ordering from the Tapas Calientes menu. The meatballs are fantastic, along with the risotto and (usually) the scallops. The wine list is also pretty good - all of which can be purchased as flights.

I recently moved just a block away from here, so I will be back often!"}
{"text":"This place is run by the fine folks who run Mallorca and is pretty much the polar opposite portion size to Mallorca.  It's located nicely on E. Carson St. and provides for complimentary valet on the weekends,so you don't have to deal with the hell of parking in the S. Side on a Saturday night.  It's right across the street from the Birmingham Bridge and is beautiful inside.  The lighting is awesome with very high ceilings and an upstairs dining room that is perfect for hosting a small private party.  Another great aspect is the private patio in the back, I mean what could be better than drinking sangria, eating foie gras, outside in the city.  The bar is pretty small right across from the open kitchen with some hitops for drinking and sampling.  It's fun having an after dinner drink at the bar.  Mainly because they swear back and forth like sailors in a portugese accent.  Someone should post it on youtube.  I last ate here on Monday night and the place was expectedly pretty empty, except for a few at the bar.  We were seated in a nice location by the window, perfect for people watching.  We ordered a bottle of wine, conondrum I think?  It was overpriced, but still I've seen worse.  Then we began our selection of delicious tapas.  This is the way I love to eat (small plates).  Who wants to have 40 bites of anything, so we started with 4 tapas.  I'd say 2 to 3 each is plenty, by the way it can get very expensive when some of the tapas are $15 each or more.  I ordered Foie Gras, which was overall pretty good, but some of the pieces were overcooked.  I had my friend try it without telling her that it was goose liver.  She liked it until I told her.  We also ordered brie with strawberrrys a bit undercooked should have been more gooey, but the sauce was nice.  We also tried a risotti which was a little too big in my opinion to be called a tapas and they should have made it smaller and charged less.  We tried a piece of filet which was tender and good.  We had a few other things, but I'd had some wine by then so I can't quite remember.  Overall good date place.  Go and sit outside and get adventorous with your ordering.  Try the sangria also.   With a few improvements, could be 4 stars.  It's the only authentic taps place I've found in the burgh."}
{"text":"When I arrived here for a friend's birthday dinner, I really liked the location and atmosphere. We were seated in the outside deck. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant was nice! However the food was par. Nothing special about it. The calamari was over seasoned. My duck entree was tooo salty. The only thing I really liked was the sangria. I would go back just to have drinks."}
{"text":"I love this place. If you're looking for a much more elegant and quaint way to sample many dishes on a chic' scale, this is the place. Seems like many LOVE this place."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a meal here for a birthday get together a few months back, so bare with me if I don't spare ya the details.

I thoroughly enjoy small plates since you get an array of different tastes and this place was sure not to let me down.  It has a great ambiance about the place and the patio provides a great intimate eating area (not sure if it's opened in the winter though!).  Some of the plates that stood out to me were the Kobe beef, lamb, and clams.  I'm not quite sure that the combinations are the same as the current menu, but I don't think you'll be disappointed with their ability to mix flavors.  I know I probably tried 5 or 6 different dishes, but unfortunately I didn't Yelp it when it was fresh.  My apologies for that.  It certainly reminds me of some of the trendier places I would frequent in Chicago.  

Though I'm not a huge fan in general, the sangria was pretty tasty.  The major downside to this establishment is their short list of quality brews.  If they beefed up their micro-brew selection and let me know, I'd be a repeat offender.

Oh, I do remember the valet service being quite strange.  I pulled up to the valet and he more or less pointed me in the direction of a parking spot.  It's not a big deal for if I had a date at the time, it would have been a short walk to the door.  I wasn't charged and my car was safe in the lot until I picked it up later in the night."}
{"text":"This place definitely has an awesome ambiance...very trendy chic. In respect to the food, there was definitely something left to be desired there. I love how a place claims to be tapas...but it is just smaller portions of a regular dish. That is not tapas! True tapas is small portions yes but incredibly tasty and delectable...something that packs a punch! The food here was okay...we tried the risotto, fish, pasta, and the cheese platter (pretty awful), just to mention a few. For me personally, not worth the price. I have had better and cheaper tapas in NYC."}
{"text":"Loved the crab cakes, calamari, scallops and shrimp! After the first taste of squid (excellent marinara sauce) I was only bummed that I had missed out on the groupon deal hours earlier, so I could order more!

Our servers were quite the characters too... just make sure you check on the back room diners more often, its easy to eat those small plates fast and want to order more, but we cant do it without you!"}
