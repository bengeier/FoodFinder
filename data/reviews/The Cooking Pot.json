{"text":"I have to say this was the worst!!!!! their fufu was a cross between mash potatoes and fufu. the stew was drenched in palm oil. the the cost was ridiculous for what it was and to be saved the on plastic plates insulting. Just absolutely the worst food ever."}
{"text":"We went to visit a hour before closing but even so the service was great. We got stewed beef, oxtails, plantains and rice jollof yummmm! Everything was great place has nice decor and is very clean."}
{"text":"The excitement of something new and international, with the complements of a warm and friendly grace, offered a meal that is not easily forgotten.   The office's lunch bunch group wandered our way to Cooking Pot and found a dazzling gem hidden in the dust and grime of Independence Blvd. We arrived early and were quickly greeted by the owner, Esther. Sweet and silly, she guided us down the line of all her offerings. She tells us jullof rice is a staple in Nigeria and that \"a party without jullof rice is not a party, it's just a meeting!\" Loved her from that moment on and of course I had to try the jullof rice! I opted for the $0.75 up-charge to get half jullof and half \"regular\" rice. The \"regular\" rice - not so regular after all! Both delicious and simmering in flavor! I picked the beef stewed in tomato sauce (choice of fish and chicken are also available) which was poured over the bed of rice and squeezed beside a side of plantains. Not only did every dish radiate flavor and happiness, Cooking Pot is incredibly reasonably priced with a hefty portion to devour! Thank you Ms. Esther. This will be a new regular stop for our office lunch!"}
{"text":"Incredible food. The jollof with beef and chicken was spiced and cooked to perfection and the moi moi was delicious. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff! Perfect balance of spice in food!  So satisfying! A little gem next to DMV plate registration office and will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Gosh!  We went because of the reviews and it was awful!  The only good thing in this gloomy mostly vacant restaurant was the bottled beer.  The Jollof Rice with beef was dry rice with tough hunks of beef, which were not obviously beef.  Hard to determine.  Having been in parts of Africa, like Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Botswana and South Africa I have experienced authentic African food.  The Cooking Pot has the right ingredients, but they don't put them together in the savory, well-cooked manner of the natives.  To that point the goat meat, a staple across Africa was terrible.  What is going on here?    Don't ask me to try again.  My wife and I were terribly disappointed."}
{"text":"They do business backward at this place. You can never just come and eat or get your food here, It has to be a long drawn out process. If you order at the counter it's an automatic 30 minutes to an hour wait.  The man that works at the front counter is rude and just not about customer satisfaction. His tone is too harsh and critical. It sad because I really want to like and support this place. Try it at your own risk"}
{"text":"Charlotte, meet Nigeria!  Discovered this new restaurant driving pass on my way home, doing a double-take that nearly caused a pile up. African food less than 2 miles from my house? I almost needed a sedative to calm down.  Got home and decided I wasn't cooking tonight. Called the restaurant to ensure they were fully operational & certain menu items were available. Arrived and was surprised by the very modern spacious warm decor. There is a striking piece of art that captivated me throughout my meal. I must visit Africa one day.  Was warmly greeted by the owner. I had tons of questions, and she patiently and lovingly answered each without the slightest bit of annoyance (which I seem an expert at evoking). The place is well designed, spotless, and the food is presented well.  Cheerful Nigerian music plays. She went over each item,  explaining why she serves hen, the preferred poultry in Nigeria, even though more costly.  I ordered egusi soup with fufu and hen.   The fufu was FRESH. Not powdered. So fresh I was forced to ask her if she pounded it back there while I waited. Delicious. The soup, earthy and savory. The hen was tasty.  Now, I am a Brooklyn-born Black American, and have only infrequently eaten West African food in NYC and DC, so questioned the value of my opinion. There were 2 men debating the 'dark web' in Ibo language (the topic on CNN on the flatscreen). One, a local attorney, then asked me if I was enjoying my food. I asked him if he'd eaten there before, and if he was connected in some way to the owner. Both answers were no, so I asked him if he would give me his opinion once his order arrived.   Special note: At one point, both men looked at my plate in disbelief. I had eaten all the soup and was enjoying the remaining fufu by itself. They were horrified. Apparently, there is a delicate balance that must be struck. Everything must be consumed concurrently. It is sacrilegious to eat plain fufu. I had to argue with them NOT to order me an extra cup of soup to complete my meal \"properly\". Lol. Don't mess with people's traditions.  Oh..yeah...they said the food was on point. I am validated.  An incredibly soul satisfying meal in an surprisingly modern set-up. Really, I am overjoyed. Great African food & great service within walking distance from my home. It is a sign; 2016 will be a glorious year."}
{"text":"A little off the beaten path, but more than worth the effort! This is a one-of-kind restaurant for Charlotte and a must if you like new ethnic/cultural cuisine. After some help from the gentleman working the register, since I really had no idea what anything was, I ended up with jollof rice, ox tail, and plantains. Serving size was plentiful, and not to mention, delicious and pretty inexpensive. There are plenty of other dishes to choose from.  Get yourself over here!"}
{"text":"At our office we enjoy trying new cuisines as a team. African food is one of our favorites so we decided to try out this brand restaurant. It has a unique and upscale decor. We tried a variety of the items on the menu and everything was delicious. We will definitely be back to try the fish."}
{"text":"The food is always excellent so I will give 5 stars for that but I would love for the owner to hire more workers so that the food can be prepared much faster."}
{"text":"That's what I'm talking about!  #Delicious. Got the small plate: rice, melt in your mouth #chicken, and plantains. #thecookingpot #falcorwine"}
{"text":"If you are a lover of international cuisine and haven't been to Cooking Pot yet, stop what you're doing, get in your car and head to East Independence Blvd. right now! A large group from my office visited for lunch on Wednesday, unsure what we were getting ourselves into.  The owner, Esther, greeted us warmly and took the time to explain all the food. It's clear she loves her country and introducing diners to Nigerian cuisine. I really appreciated the time she took to explain jollof (\"a party in Nigeria without this rice is just a meeting\"), the right way to eat fufu (\"place a piece on your spoon with soup and swallow; only newbies chew\") and all the ingredients in moi-moi.   As much as I wanted to try the fufu, the beautiful jollof rice and grass-fed beef in a tomato sauce/stew was too tempting. I told myself, \"I'll get the fufu next time.\" But, it's going to be hard not to order the rice and meat combo every time. The rice is comforting and full of flavor. The beef was good but the real show stopper for me was the sauce it was in. Rich and hearty with layers and layers of flavor. If Nigeria has a comfort food, this has got to be it!   In case all that wasn't enough, this \"small\" combo comes with a heaping portion of fried plantains. The Yelp world may not know this about me, but I am SUCH a sucker for plantains. And, these did not disappoint. No matter what I order on future visits, rest assured I will always be requesting a side of these plantains.   The restaurant is beautiful and spotlessly clean. Tucked off East Independence Blvd. it can be a little tricky to find -- we actually got there from Conference Drive -- so use your GPS for help.   Can't wait for my next visit to Esther's place!"}
{"text":"Decor was upscale. Restrooms were very tidy and clean. We enjoy trying new cultures cuisines and this would be our first to try African. I must say, it's really tasty. I especially enjoy their Jollof rice and plantain. The fried mackerel looked really appealing. I'll save it for next time. The seasoning is similar to Cajun.   Very spacious restaurant and I'm very surprised at the location. If it wasn't for is wanting to try something new, we probably wouldn't have stopped in. I must say though, it was 7pm and they close at 9pm, their menu shows more items which wasn't available to us. Maybe I'll stop by and update this review after I do.   Do try them out."}
{"text":"This is one of the best And authentic African cuisine in charlotte!!!! And the food is the atmosphere is so relaxing and CLEAN. I can't wait for everyone to try here."}
{"text":"A friend from Lagos recommended I try some Nigerian food. So, I lucked up a found this place 5 minites from my house. It was meant to be. The jollof rice was everything I heard it would be. The beef was delicious, although the chicken was very dry. I know next time to get an extra order of plantain. They were amazing. I also got a side of shaki to have with the rest of my rice. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is some seriously authentic Nigerian food and it's cooked with love. The proprietress/head chef is a lovely lady who's not shy about coming to your table and explaining food origins and the correct way to eat the fufu. The food is fresh and cooked from scratch, to perfection. There's a perfect balance of spice, oil, and heat. Interior is clean and comfortable, service efficient and friendly, and prices are very reasonable! I love that such exotic food is right here in Charlotte. Calling all lovers of unique food, come out and support The Cooking Pot today!!"}
{"text":"I had the moi moi and egusi sauce, traditionally these are not typically eaten together,  but hey. .. that's what I wanted. Boy,  am I glad I did.  The food is aunthetic and delicious.   The ambiance is nice,  though casual.  Certain items are available daily,  but may want to call ahead if you're  itching for a specific dish your grandma' sister's neighbor's best friend made."}
{"text":"Yummy west African food served using GRASS FED BEEF  the beignets and rice were amazing! Very hospitable staff!"}
{"text":"Qfirst time eating African food and it was delicious! It's in a shopping plaza which is kind of hidden and it can get lost in the signage at the top of the restaurant. Super quiet when I walked in and of your new you will have to get use to the names of the food. Your better off telling them what your looking."}
{"text":"This is my first and probably only 5 star review.  If you have eating west African food before or want to try something new, this is the place for you. Authentic, Nigerian style home food will keep your taste buds dancing through the night.  The Cooking Pot brings African food from mom's kitchen to a restaurant near you. I had the egusi soup with pounded yam fufu. It was absolutely delicious and fresh. Please go and visit this place the first chance you get. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend and some really great mackerel, jollof rice, and plantains. The service was great and the hibiscus juice was great!"}
{"text":"Nice Decor. It was ok, lots of potential though. I think at certain times they need to have more than one person working at the restaurant. When I went it got pretty busy and their was only one guy working. Because of this it took FOREVER to get our food...  Also the 'pounded yam' the day I went didn't taste much like pounded yam, but generic jiffy or 'mash potato' mix I would have liked for this to be clearly said .. when I asked I would have liked to be clearly told instead of beating around the bush. The menu was very limited ... But maybe I went too late. There was also one trashcan that needed to be emptied with fruit flies buzzing all around. All in all it was OK and the egusi was good, but I'm not so motivated to go back--if I go back I I'll call ahead to see what's on the menu that day As I said lots of potential here, I hope they use it to it's full extent and do well. Charlotte certainly has a need for Nigerian restaurants."}
