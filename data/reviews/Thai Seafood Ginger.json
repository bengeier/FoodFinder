{"text":"What an awesome place!   Really enjoyed the service and food. My husband and I got spoiled at this place.   Got free appetizer and ice cream on the house. Portion was great. Flavor was on the point. My husband did not have to order extra rice. It was plenty of the food. We ordered green curry and sweet and chilli salmon. Both were very good!!  Server Sean was very attentive."}

{"text":"Great authentic Thai food. Service is also great. Highly recommend if you're looking for a great place to dine."}
{"text":"Found this gem in yelp with great reviews, and close to home. Clean set up, friendly server Shawn, and deelish food. Kalbi and pad thai was tasty and mango sticky rice was awesome. Thnx for the comp crab rangoons. Will mos def return."}
{"text":"Good food, great service, nice ambiance! Ordered the shrimp fried rice, chicken panang, fried tofu, oysters and sticky rice with mango and its a must try Olé was really nice n gave a great service. We will definitely come back. So guys come n check this place out"}
{"text":"Got to try the lemon chicken, it was delicious. Our server Olé was fabulous, made our day"}
{"text":"Great place! The drunken noodles were excellent, and the crab Rangoon was awesome. And the staff were incredibly friendly. This will definitely be my Thai place of choice when in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"You must give this place a try! It's worth every penny and minute. From the exterior it looks like a closed hole in the wall restaurant, but once you walk in, the layout of the restaurant is refreshingly spacious. The customer sevice was completely gracious and kind...excellent service. Phoo was great! I really appreciated the complimentary Thai tea and traditional Thai fruit drink he gave me. I ordered the sukiyaki soup which was ready before I knew it. The portion was way more than I expected. It was enough for two! And it was sooo tasty! The prices are so reasonable. I'm so happy I found this restaurant. I'll definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"We were fortunate to have adorable Ole as our server. He now knows all our names. I am allergic to shellfish so I went with Pad See Ew with tofu. It was delicious! Wide rice noodles so yummy with egg and Chinese broccoli. We started with beef and chicken satay. The chicken was excellent and I preferred it to the beef. My friends had a seafood curry they raved about but sadly I could not indulge. For dessert I got a free homemade coconut ice cream scoop that was outstanding. I got it for checking in on yelp thank you!"}
{"text":"An update to my poor review of my takeout order of Pad Thai with chicken, medium spice. The leftover meal (most of the dish) was actually very tasty.  When I first ate it, I was put off by the dryness of my 'fresh' meal, but when I reheated it the next day, it was quite good."}
{"text":"This is the best hidden little place ever! Don't be fooled by outside appearances this setup inside is very feng sui! We started out with perfect shrimp tempura.. By far cleanest shrimp ever according to my Alaskan husband. We also pad Thai which was unique and perfectly cooked! The pineapple curry was divine and refreshing and the gang parang isn't no joke but delicious and well balanced! The people working are so friendly and genuine! Thai coffee and tea is exceptional and overall a clean sheek look!!  Also authentic hip music. Love this place"}
{"text":"Lunch was fantastic, the portions are big enough to fill you up. Plus with main dish at luch you get salad and a choice of egg rolls or fried dumplings. We tried both and my advice: get dumplings, they are soooo good! Also we got complimentary lemonade. Very friendly staff, excellent food. Definitely we'll be back"}
{"text":"Their seafood bibimbop and seaweed soup are the greatest things ever. Also their soft shell crab appetizer was a great way to start up our dinner. I am more than willing to visit back here sometime soon."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant after seeing it pop up as a new place on yelp.  Really glad we gave it a try.  Excellent food, great service.  Crab Rangoon was awesome."}
{"text":"The delivery was fast and the packaging was sturdy and cute.   We ordered the yellow curry and pad se ew and they were both delicious. I will order from again!"}
{"text":"True story: when deciding where and what to eat we came across Ginger Thai Seafood . When we entered we were greeted right away with a welcoming Hello and sat down right away. The server was very patience with our questions about the food selections. The food was fresh, delicious and beautifully plattered. Above all else the server Ole was AMAZING! We will definitely be coming back.  Thank You to the whole staff."}
{"text":"Ordered from here with coworkers from my office and we were all very happy with our food. The crab Rangoon is really great. My coworker and I shared that and pineapple fried rice with shrimp and there was plenty for the both of us. Maybe season the shrimp before tossing them in with the rice, they were very well cooked otherwise, perfect. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great service from our server, Ole, very clean & delicious Thai cuisine!! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our server was Ole, great service. The food was delicious. We had the crab rangoon, garlic soft shell crab, combo pad Thai,  and the fish mango salad which was top notch. We'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Service is A++++! The place is nice and clean! We got free dumplings and fish just because. Every dish we ordered (padthai, pad se ew, drunken noodles, fish mango salad, kimchi jigae, etc) was amazing! Probably one of the best Thai restaurant I have been to. Will definitely come back here again next time I am in Vegas. I would 100% recommend this place if you are looking for good food and if you want servers that treat you good. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Today was my third time at Thai Seafood Ginger.  Obviously I liked it enough to return.  The first time we ordered delivery online.  The last two visits have been for lunch.  The lunch specials are a great deal.  For $9 you get your choice of a handful of entrees that come with a small side salad and choice of appetizer (either vegetable eggrolls, crab rangoon, or fried dumplings). I recommend the rangoon, as good as I have had. I've had the seafood combo drunken noodles, seafood combo pad see ew, and chicken pad see ew.  They were all very good, and good sized portions for the price.  The lunch specials are a smaller portion, but still plenty of food.    A couple pieces of advice.  The seafood combo is all seafood as opposed to the chicken, beef, pork, and shrimp combo I was expecting.  It was good, but know that you are getting shrimp, scallops, mussels, octopus, etc.    Finally, they offer you the choice of mild, medium, hot, and Thai hot.  Realistically, your choices are bland or melt your face.  Mild has not spice.  Medium is somewhere between boiling water and molten lava. Hot is similar to the surface of the sun.  I can only imagine Thai hot resembles the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark when they open the Ark.  I expect Thai food to be hot, but this is another level.  The great thing is the waiter was more than happy to work with us.  We ordered one dish between medium and hot, one medium, one between mild and medium, and one mild.  We also received extra chiles on the side so everyone could add heat if they wanted more.  I recommend going a level below what you think you normally want and ask for some chiles on the side."}
{"text":"Service was great. Atmosphere quiet. Our server, Olé is awesome and so friendly. We had spring rolls for appetizer and I really like that the peanut sauce came out warm. Everything is made fresh. We also got chicken fried rice (not too salty), shrimp chu chi which had a slight sweetness to it and i normally dont like sweet tastes with food unless its dessert, green beef curry (med spice) was spiiicy and we could handle spice but so flavorful and delicious! Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Great 1st time experience!  I needed a place to get some warm soup late at night and just searched on Yelp for the nearest Thai that was on my way home and up came this one. I like the unique name too. The signage isn't the best and it's tucked back away in a corner but was open! The inside is VERY  bright and open and smelled of bleach -- it's almost industrial. I was thinking of something darker and cozier but it was fine--so then Olé came out and was soooo welcoming and accommodating! He is awesome! He gave amazing recommendations for the seafood soup and Pad voon sen! The food was piping hot and fresh! Awesomeness! And yes as Olé had said it's was the BEST Thai iced tea EVER! The chef does some magic brewing. So I will be back for Olé and the food -- the one star off is for the general ambience but that's a personal thing. Oh and they gave me free coconut ice cream for checking in on Yelp-more yumminess!! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Their pad thai was amazing! Great vibe and good food."}
{"text":"Food was about average to me for a lunch/dinner spot. They have a mix of Thai and Korean dishes. I almost always choose Thai food every time I go out to eat but then I saw that they have seafood bibimbap on the menu so I ordered that instead. The brown rice was undercooked and stale which kinda made the fish and all of the toppings not as enjoyable when they're all mixed up. You can get something similar/better at Sakura Sushi inside Greenland market. It's called haedubap and comes w/ variety of fish instead of just salmon plus cheaper too. They were also out of Thai tea ice cream and nom yen (pink Thai milk tea) that I really wanted to try especially since not many other places offer those. Their complimentary crab rangoon they brought out to us was delicious though - it was perfectly crispy and even had real crab meat inside. Service here was friendly and attentive. I feel that there are other places around the area that are just better overall."}
{"text":"The former Hooligan's dive bar with stuffed burgers has finally been replaced by a new business- Thai Seafood Ginger, straightforward Thai seafood specialties despite the backwards-sounding name. Hopefully they will be able to overcome their hidden location and stick around longer than their predecessors.   We were brought out an appetizer sampler on the house, for the kitchen to test out new dishes. The rangoon, squid salad, seafood salad, and pickled veggies were all fresh and well-made. We started with the tom kha soup (sub tofu for the usual protein), and I had the Drunken Noodle entree (also with tofu) while my guy had their Spicy Garlic Shrimp- the seafood dish was definitely the best of what we ordered, which is in line with their business name. Pricing initially seemed a touch high but was justified by large portions.  The soup had a great broth, and was heartier than usual with added carrots and other veggies. The noodle dish was decent, but modifications to add mushroom and sub tofu to accommodate my (part time) vegan diet were met with a dish that had egg (despite it not being listed in the description), no requested mushroom, and a ton of fried tofu... that was soggy rather than crispy. My guy really enjoyed his shrimp dish and the spicy garlic sauce I tried was robust and flavorful. The seafood was definitely their strongest dish.  Service was friendly and the interior has undergone a complete transformation since it's days as a dive bar- the bright modern interior has a red and black theme and a huge bar area. They're close enough to home to be my go-to Thai takeout option, so I may revisit for lunch, or perhaps to try some of their Korean dishes."}
{"text":"I hate to say this, but I have been here a number of times and it started out great. But it has declined steadily, in my opinion. Yesterday, I had some chicken pad thai that was so sweet that I couldn't believe it. The noodles were stuck together in wads. There was no one else in the place, yet half eaten food, dishes and half empty glasses remained on an adjoining table throughout the meal. Perhaps they changed chefs... the waitress was very nice, but otherwise, I don't know what gives. Keep it clean. The Health Dept was there and took down the not very uplifting C rating right before I left, but I did not remain to see if it went to an A from there. I hope so. Come on, people, this is why restaurants go out of business so fast. Please pay attention to the fundamentals."}
{"text":"Since 3-stars to me is simply average, I cannot bring myself to give it.   Upon arriving, Hubs and I were seated quickly with note that our server would be right with us. And right with us he was! We were greeted with enthusiasm and friendliness that you just don't find in Vegas. Service was exceptional, for sure!   Being half Korean, I had to try their Korean dishes. Hubs is not a fan of the dishes offered for Korean fare, so he stuck with our favorite - Yellow Curry with chicken. I ordered the Kalbi, even though I'm usually a little wary of ordering Korean from a non-Korean venue.   We were brought a plate of crab Rangoon, on the house. I have to say, this really was the best I've had in the Valley. I am usually not a fan of the dish, but I didn't want to be rude and not at least try it - I ended up eating them all, they were that good! Hot and fresh from the fryer, the filling was creamy, just a tad sweet (just how I like it) and filled with REAL crab meat. I would definitely recommend you try it here if you like this dish!   The main course came out shortly after - Hubs stated his meal was good, but that he's had better. It appeared to have a good mix of vegetables and was balanced well with the amount of chicken. I tried a taste of his broth at the end and agree, although it was good, we have had better. We both prefer our curry a little more on the creamy side (this appeared to be pretty watery) and there was a bit of a... tang? to it. Just a little different than what we're used to/prefer - but definitely NOT bad. Probably wouldn't satisfy a craving for curry for me, but would be a decent meal option if I was just out for a good meal.   The Kalbi - well, it was good, but I likely won't order it again. With so many Korean options in Vegas, it's just not on the top of my list. The meat was tender and well marinated, but the taste was a little... off... from what I'm used to. I enjoy the meat a little sweeter, and with less of a puree covered feel. I understand for many places, the marinade recipe calls for pureed fruit, and this may have been what I was feeling - but it's just not my style. The meat also seemed to be a sloppy cut at the butcher - which is not something to really hold against the restaurant, but when I have to be careful about how hard I chew because a shaving of rib bone might be in the mix, it's a little less enjoyable.   All in all, the location is nearby which makes it very convenient. The prices are reasonable and although the taste isn't what we're \"used to\", it's not like the meal was bad, it that makes any sense. Kind of like - it's good, but not like mom makes it. You know what I mean?  Also, I ordered a Thai Iced Tea - they boast it's the best in Las Vegas. It's good, very good, but there are other places just as good, or even a little better - for much cheaper. $4 for the drink is a little steep for me. I got it for free with the current check in offer, so it wasn't so bad - but knowing it is $4, I will likely be going elsewhere for my tea needs (when I don't brew it at home)."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch. They have a small selection for their lunch special which was ok. The portions are big for lunch and filling. The food was delicious. My husband ordered the bi bim bap it was large and good except there was a little shell on the bottom, the waitress was quick to rectify the problem and apologized for it. The atmosphere is clean and nice. The waitress staff was very nice and attentive. I would go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Very friendly service.Ordered sole fish,drunken noodle,fried rice and they were all delicious.Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went back.  Very disappointed this trip. I ordered shrimp tempura to be told the were out of shrimp.  Asked about  chu chi scallops.  I asked specifically if it was spicy. Our waiter said it was not.   When it arrived it was shrimp  I thought they were out which is why I changed my order.  He said they could make my scallops but everyone else was almost done so I said no.  The shrimp were rubbery and the sauce was to spicy for me to eat. When I told the waiter he said sorry. So I did not eat it .  Money down the drain.  My granddaughters bimimbop was good."}
{"text":"This place was sooooo delicious! I recommend the lemon chicken definitely because it was the best I ever had! Even if your a vegetarian you might want to make an exception for this chickenThe people here are so nice and this is one of my favorite places in Vegas"}
{"text":"We had dinner here for the first time and it was delicious raw oysters and padtad with shrimp  yellow curry  awesome!! We well be back very nice server \"\"Bo\"\" she was very nice !!"}
{"text":"Pretty much everything in this place was pretty damn great. The service was good and because they just opened they brought us out alot of free stuff to try. They treated the missus an I like royalty. Definetly a good date night spot, good ambience."}
{"text":"Thankful to have found this place for Sunday dinner. Ordered the fried sole fish, cashew chicken, pineapple fried rice, and drunken noodle.  We were surprised how good and flavorful everything was. Service was quick, we were given free appetizers, and coconut/green tea ice cream (after checking in on Yelp). Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great service our server Ole he was so kind and I would come here again fosho. We tried Lemon chicken with sweet shrimp and it was absolutely Delicious. Thank you"}
{"text":"\"Things turn out best for the people who make the best of the way things turn out.\" - John Wooden  Average Thai food in Las Vegas is not hard to come by. Average Thai food with exceptional service? Well, that's a little more rare. We heard about a new Thai restaurant that also had some Korean dishes. This is normally not a good thing. It's typically better if a restaurant specializes in one cuisine, but then there's always exceptions to that norm...such as island style. So when we looked and saw seafood in the name, we knew we had to check it out...   As it turns out, what you have at Thai Seafood Ginger is average food accompanied with the aforementioned outstanding service. As such, I wouldn't try to dissuade the casual Thai eater from coming here...but for those that don't believe that all curries are created equal, there are a lot of better Thai places in town.  - 2.5 Stars -"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Ordered yellow chicken curry, short ribs, and lemon chicken. Everything was cooked to perfection, will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, food is amazing and the restaurant looks great! Olé i will be seeing you again! Got a seafood combo Drunken Noodle, it was incredible! My new fav Thai place"}
{"text":"I went to Thai Seafood Ginger on a Saturday night with a friend.  I ordered the spicy seafood soup and I can't remember what she ordered, but it looked delicious!  The portion sizes were delightfully large so we had enough to take home for lunch the next day.  We had a super kind server which made things even more awesome.  The spicy seafood soup was delicious and flavorful.  Instead of rice, it came with noodles which was a pleasant surprise!  When you check in with Yelp, there's a offer for free ice cream.  The Thai tea flavor was heavenly.  I will definitely go back again to try more items from the menu.  Perhaps the sukiyaki next time!"}
{"text":"Great wait staff, the restaurant is clean and nicely decorated, a varied menu. Love the lime aid drink"}
{"text":"got drunken noodle with shrimp, $14, i think for this quality food is way overpriced. it should not be more than $8. very simple cheap dish. I wont be back ever Again and not reccomend this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I just spent 2 months in Thailand and coming here is just like being back in paradise. Great food, great service, great big portions. Highly recommended! Ole was our server and we loved him."}
{"text":"Thai Seafood Ginger is new... but not hot :-(  I had a 10% off coupon to use, so my love and I went to check this new restaurant out after a mid week yoga class. We were ready to Indulge in some Thai food with seafood.  As you walk in, you see a large, yet something-missing kind of space...it almost looked as if it was not open for business. We were greeted by our server who was so welcoming--genuinely affable and warm. We ordered Papaya Salad, Seafood  Curry, and Pad See Ew.  The Papaya Salad was prepared with green papaya and seasoned with tomatoes, green beans, peanuts, cabbage,  and spicy lime dressing...the taste was not memorable. Not a good memorable anyway, the cabbage was not fresh...it had a sharp aroma that wasn't pleasant. We were so excited to taste the Seafood Curry until we saw and tasted the dish...far too watery to be a Thai style curry and too plain to be served. The vegetables in the curry seemed to be thawed after frozen, especially carrot slices. The Pad See Ew was the best we had, but the noodles were undercooked to any standard. This dish lacked flavor as well.  It's hard for me to grasp where all those 5 star reviews came from and why we didn't have those amazing dishes they set out for others...I can only hope Thai Seafood Ginger improves and meets the standard of Vegas's educated and intelligent eaters.  - 2017 Review #13 -"}
{"text":"The food is amazingly fresh, you can tell the vegetables are purchased and cooked same day! Literally the service was so quick and very attentive. The restaurant itself is very clean and chic and the vibe when you walk in is just very chill. Also the variety in the menu and well as how many different ingredients added into the dishes themselves is amazing. You can tell they care about making the food good not just making an easy buck. Also reasonably priced, found my new favorite Thai restaurant in vegas!"}
{"text":"The wait staff was really friendly.  They even gave us a complementary appetizer.  My only complaint is we asked for mild and the entree was still super spicy."}
{"text":"My daughter & I are comfortably happy that we found this spot soooo close or w/in to where we live/work by. Been here twice & each time we come, we leave happily content & FULL! From the drinks, appetizers, meals/dishes to the deserts... all mmm mmm good! The place is nice n clean, you can sit @ the counter or have a table or booth (we usually choose a booth). Haven't gone when it was sooo busy to have to wait for a table (thank goodness because we usually go when we are sooo hungry! Lol) but the service is quick & our server Josh (whom we got on both visits) was VERY professionally nice & informative. He was even very honest when we asked if the flower that was served w/our ice cream was edible (because it was too pretty to eat lol) and he honestly replied that we can & that it wasn't poisonous or anything but it won't taste as good as the ice cream. Now that sold me! Love the Thai coffee, Spicy Garlic Shrimp (A+), Garlic w/Soft Shell Crab, Bibimbop, Papaya Salad, Beef Satay, Oysters (2 for $5.95), Tom Yum (choice of spice level), lunch special Beef Pad See Ew aaaand have to mention that if u check in w/Yelp you get a free ice cream or drink sooo I got Mochi ice cream & Charlotte ( my daughter ) got the Thai ice cream! So yes of course we'll come back! Gotta try for more favorites! Lol sooo come on down & NJOY! Thx smooches"}
{"text":"Ole' was a great server! He was very nice and great to talk to. Lunch was decent, had the shrimp chow mein lunch. The crab rangoon are bomb! I'll be back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"My mom, sister, & I were looking for a Thai restaurant and found this gem on Yelp. They just opened a month ago and there's not a lot of people at the restaurant.   FOOD: Amazing! We tried the Spicy Garlic Shrimp and the Fried Chili Seafood. They don't skimp on the seafood. The ingredients (scallops, mussels, shrimp, squid, & clam) were all fresh.  SERVICE: A+mazing (as Mariah Carey would say). We had two servers (Dao and Olé). They very friendly, quick, accommodating, & sweet. The owner also gave us complimentary Crab Rangoon and we got our free ice cream.  We definitely recommend this place! Authentic!!!  There is one tip: They do not serve alcohol but you can bring your own alcohol."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time to try this new Thai restaurant and it was absolutely delicious! I was born and raised in Vegas lived here 42 years tried several Thai restaurants, but this one was by far the BEST in the West! The ambiance was decadent! The server Ole' was amazing probably the main reason we would go back again and again! The food was on point paired with the best Thai Tea I've ever had. I will definitely recommend this new spot to everyone I known.  I will absolutely be back to try more dishes"}
{"text":"Definitely coming back here next time I visit Vegas. The food is really good. Favorite so far is the pad se ew and crab ragoons. I want to try the pad thai next time. Their thai tea and Korean orange juice is really good too. I also loved the service. Very friendly and welcoming. Made me feel like I was right at home."}
{"text":"Although my friend wanted chicken satay and they didn't have it, I ordered the chicken pad Thai. It is delicious!! I will definitely visit again! Their Thai tea and crab rangoons are also very delicious."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and don't order thai food here. I seriously dont know where all the good reviews came from. Korean food? Store bought?  Let's start off with basic tom yum. If you cant pull this off, then you're no thai restaurant.  What kind of tom yum is sweet instead of sour? There was so much oil on the surface that half of my spoon was submerged in it.  Pad see ew. The noodles were unevenly cooked and tastewise, it was awfully mediocre. Kale was extremely bitter.  Curry. I'm not complaining, but it does run a bit watery compared to other places.  The cashier also needs to speak more clearly. She also should be able to explain her menus more thoroughly."}
{"text":"We're new to the area and heard good things about this new local place. We were not disappointed. The chicken satay was great, only to be outdone be the drunken noodle, which is probably the best I've ever had; perfect amount of spice and flavor. Looking forward to coming back often."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying customer service is excellent and the place has a great ambience. The food was delicious and I would definitely come back! I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Seafood and high quality Asian cuisine is what this place is all about. The owners have a fish cannery in Alaska so the seafood coming to you from their kitchens is fresh and fine. As a fairly new place in town you can feel this place is just getting going. Well with a visit."}
{"text":"I recently started going to this place and was very impressed. When I got there there was no one there so I was little iffy at first . The employees are super nice. They gave me complimentary crab rangoon and they were really good. I ordered pad see ew and it was so delicious. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! Sooooo delicious!!! Plenty of fresh sea food in dishes. Specially crab Rangoon is the best of the best. You should try this place!!!!!!!! The best Thai restaurant in Vegas~"}
{"text":"Thai food here is Very Tasty.  We had the Fried chili seafood. It was so yummy!!! Highly recommend this dish.  Also had the papaya salad, very good too. This place is really big inside. Waitress is really nice.  I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Are you sure this restaurant is Thai restaurant?? We order 2 Thai dish but that's no even close to other Thai restaurant! !  Price is too high   Lunch special is not special at all :( I thought this restaurant gonna be my lunch spot since my work is just right here but I guess not .... so sad  1star is for the service! But food was terrible  Do not pick beef ! Not good :("}
{"text":"Food is good, staff is nice, clean inside, weird outside. It's good, nothing amazing, but they'll do the spice up how you like it."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and helpful. The food was good and the portions were plentiful. We tried the papaya salad, lunch special yellow curry and Thai basil stir fry. The curry was very good, Thai basil is good and the papaya salad was just ok. Overall I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best waiter I've ever had, really kind and funny  AMAZING food and BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED! If you have not ate here and you love Thai food, what are you waiting for???"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal there this past Friday evening.  The server was professional and helpful and the food is the REAL deal.  Beautiful crisp Kimchi -- the Crab Rangoon alone is worth a drive!  It is generously stuffed like the plumpest ravioli - you actually feast on the crab mixture and not merely taste the wanton... the best I've ever had anywhere.  We also tried the taco kimchi, taco galbi, and the bibimbap - all with the freshest ingredients and all were delicious and memorable.  We will frequent this place - I want an encore already!  The homemade ice cream is healthy and out-of-this world!  Clean and spacious space - family friendly -- thanks to all there - we highly recommend Thai Seafood Ginger!"}
{"text":"This place has become my favorite thai restaurant in Vegas recently!!! The food was awesome. Especially the Pad thai is so good!!!!! Seafood curry is good too. For any person who is a fan of spicy food, it is a must try (get the seafood curry with hot spiciness). Also the service is extremely good/friendly. I love the print on the wall.  Everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"The Tom Kha Kai is some of the best I've ever had and the service is excellent. I also like how they will make it really spicy for you if you request it unlike some other Thai places that won't do real spicy."}
{"text":"Service, food, and conversation with the waitress/waiter was great. I came in for the lunch special, Pad Thai, and it was excellent!!!! Will definitely come back!!! Inside is comfy and calm, not too big, not too small, very clean."}
{"text":"Special dish from the restaurant! Sweet Red Pork served with soup. Ask your server about it! And the price is only $8.95! It's very popular in Thailand and the taste it's just like when you in Thailand! No MSG!"}
{"text":"Everything we got had really great flavors. The food was so fresh and light~~amazing vegetables in our entrees. The soft-shelled crab was delicious. Our waitress, Dao, was wonderful and gave us excellent recommendations. Ending with the fresh-made coconut ice cream made this even sweeter. We will definitely come back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Spectacular food! Spring Rolls Fried Rolls Crab Rangoon Seafood Curry Lemon Chix  Merely 4-star  Drunken Noodles Korean Spicy pork  Service top notch as well"}
{"text":"Their papaya salad is yummy! I like this place it's got really neat art, the walls are red. Really cool place to hang out at, the bar area is large and comfortable. Staff is really friendly too."}
{"text":"Awesome place super good good and amazing service! I suggest the Thai tea and crab Rangoon to start off with, well def be back thanks"}
{"text":"Food was great and the waiter, Ole, was very personable. We ordered crab rangoons, which were generously filled with crab and mild with cream cheese, something I found favorable. The Kalbi beef was the star of the show, thick and seared to a tender medium rare. Along with that, we ordered Thai tea and coffee... (super strong!), fried tofu, combo pad Thai, and mango and sticky rice. This is a step-up restaurant for the area, as there are so many ordinary fast food restaurants nearby. I hope that's not too much of a challenge for this new establishment. Will return to try even more!"}
{"text":"First time here! Tried Pad See Ew, Pad Thai, shrimp fried rice, chicken fried rice, pineapple curry!!!!! *tai tea here is fabulous Amazing place! Great customer service!! I will come again whenever I visit vegas next time!!!:):):):)"}
{"text":"Very nice server amazing decor the complimentary crab ragoon out of this world hige thai teas fresh young coconut 5 stars because theres no 6 will definetly come back"}
{"text":"They know how to make Thai and Korean food. The owners are Korean and make the food so damn good. We have tried just about everything they have on the menu and nothing has let us down.  If you are looking for good Korean or Thai food this is the place to come because you get a big portion for the great price you pay."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.  Opened a month ago with tasty Thai food for a great price.    Lunch portion is a full size order and it is wayyy bigger than what one can eat in a single serving  Pad See Ew - friend got it with beef.  The noodles were spongy and not soggy (overcooked).  Thick sauce and not overly salty.  Veggies were cooked well.  Pineapple curry - with shrimp and fried tofu.  More viscous curry so eat with a fork if you're using a plate.  Shrimp was firm and tofu added some extra protein.  Crab ragoon - fried lightly with crispy skin (not burnt) with a good about of filling  Thai tea - \"It was like crack.\"  Thai coffee - a bit sweeter Vietnamese coffee but still delicious.  Very large sized drink  Hot tea - korean tea bag that comes in a cute porcelain cup with lid to keep warm.  It stayed hot through the whole meal without refill.  Coconut ice cream - served in a tall stem cocktail glass.  House made with coconut milk, fresh coconut, and some type of fruit seed with tapioca like texture with a sprig of mint.  It was my favorite of the meal.  Highly recommend spot to check out.  They deliver up to 3.5 miles radius."}

{"text":"Wow...let me give the review while the flavors are still fresh in my mind & mouth.  A new mom & pop restaurant that just opened a couple months. The restaurant decor is simple but beautifully done.  We ordered a couple entrees. While waiting for our food, the chef sent out a complimentary appetizer, crab rangoon and I say it's the best I had in town. The server gave us a couple of drinks to try thai tea and lime juice. I'm not fond of cold drinks that has milk. I tried the thai tea but still not for me. My husband finished the drink though. I had the lime juice with honey. I loved the light taste of it, but a bit on the sweet side for me.   Our food arrived, deep fried fish with mango salad/salsa and it was very delicious. It reminded me of when we visited Thailand. The spiciness was just perfect. Another entree was the lemon chicken which was not bad at all but my eye was on the fish alone.   To top it all the service was top notch. Definitely a place to recommend."}
{"text":"Olè and Dao greeted us as we entered and sat us immediately. Olè and Dao took amazing care of us while we ate , the food was amazing , and the service was outstanding. It's very modern on the inside and clean. The Thai tea is to die for and the fried rolls are pretty amazing as well . We will be back to try the different items on the menu . Thank you Olè and DAo for a wonderful meal and service ..."}
{"text":"I work nearby so I checked this place out to add to my lunch rotation. Looks more like a good dinner place than a quick lunch spot. Lunch special menu could use some improvements. Nothing added to make it a special (i.e. Egg roll, salad or soup). But the food did not disappoint. Yes, the portions are on the dinner side. Curry was not thick but not runny. Did not skimp on the shrimp. No crowd yet, they need to market this place. They have my word I will."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area found this place and decide to give it a try... we were greeted by the owner they were so friendly... Our server, Olé, was so nice and friendly. Definitely a place worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Very close to where I live. I love how it is hidden as well. Meal portions are just right and the hospitality is remarkable. Hope for the best for this place!"}
{"text":"It doesn't look like it from the outside, but this place is so clean and modern. They offer amazing dishes with modern adaptations to classic, delicious Thai dishes. The food is so fresh and satisfying. The staff is incredibly friendly and the service is fast. The location may not be ideal, but this place is the best example of \"don't judge a book by its cover.\" It is one of the best Thai restaurants I have ever been to!"}
{"text":"I've loved Thai food for a long time but my wife is new to the cuisine so she found Thai Seafood Ginger and it didn't seem too intimidating so we gave it a shot. The service was wonderful, the menu had a good variety of Korean and Thai food so we sampled several different things. We started off with a Thai Tea and Coffee, which were wonderful, and two appetizers...Fresh Rolls and Crab Rangoons, both of which were great. These were the best Crab Rangoons I've ever eaten! My wife ordered the Sweet and Chilly Salmon, which was a very large salmon portion and was delicious. I had the Seafood Bibimbap which was beautifully constructed and very tasty. A simple dish that was very flavorful and filling. For dessert, we had the homemade coconut ice cream which was a very refreshing end to our meal. We are definitely adding Thai Seafood Ginger to our repertoire of restaurants to frequent and we are already looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Thai food and have had the pleasure to dine in many Vegas restaurants. We stopped in tonight, right after school and just before baseball as it's down the street from Rainbow Family Park. Hands down, the best satay EVER due to highly seasoned/marinated meat, chunky homemade peanut sauce, and the BEST seafood po tak talay, which is a light seafood soup fragrant with galangal and lemongrass (it's not as piquant nor acidic as Tom yum). And, it was chock full of mussels, clams, shrimp, squid, fish, and scallops. (Most places are stingy and use seafood as decoration.) Sean, our waiter, was awesome, very attentive and friendly. We received complimentary crab Rangoon and samples of their homemade ice-creams:  Thai tea, green tea, and coconut. The owners are Korean and own a cannery in Alaska; therefore, they have access to fresh seafood, but the cooks are all Thai."}
{"text":"Omg this restaurant is a must-try!  For starters - best Crab Rangoon my husband and I have ever had! The savory spices and melt-in-your-mouth creaminess together with the perfect crispy crunch- so delicious!  Every appetizer/entreé at this restaurant is made fresh to order- and wow can you really taste that difference!  Next came the Tom Yum Soup- Mmmmmmmm! Will have to order this every time we visit, SO good and so satisfying.  Here is all that we had to eat:  Crab Rangoon-AMAZING! Tom Yum Soup-AMAZING! Drunken Noodles- AMAZING! (This is a favorite dish of ours, and this is an excellent version, with fresh basil and a new flavor I don't recognize.)  Pad Thai- reallllly good Pineapple Curry- AMAZING! Mango Sticky Rice- reallllly good & House- made  Coconut Ice Cream- AMAZING!  The chefs are from Thailand and really know what they are doing- there are multiple layers of flavor in the dishes that engulf your senses,  you can taste the spices and fresh ingredients.   We had friendly, attentive, excellent service from Ole & Bow.  I was taking my Thai Tea to go and they topped it off for me.  My husband enjoyed delicious coffee as well.  So happy to have discovered this restaurant, they only opened a few months ago- and we wish them all the best- until next time!!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious. Pad thai was on point. Spice level was accurate,  fresh veggies. Also some of the best Crab Rangoon EVER!! I wish they had a lunch special menu, but it's amazing. They do have Korean dishes as well. I'm looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai restaurant!  The seafood is so fresh and delicious!  I really loved their garlic flavored softshell crabs!  Great service as well!  Their ice cream is homemade and so good!!"}
{"text":"My favorite server ole is gone :/ will not go back n recommend others b/c I feel the place isn't lively without him. Food isn't the best for being Thai food.  Wayyyyyyy expensive and it's not authentic or Near the busy side of Vegas like the strip."}
{"text":"Tried the Pak King with Shrimp because the stir fried ginger intrigued me. It did not disappoint. The vegetables were as much a feast for the eyes as the just right spicyness of the ginger appealed to the palate. My server, Dao, was super attentive and checked frequently to make certain everything was to my liking. Thai Seafood is tucked away...so don't miss it. Worth your time and wallet to stop by for a welcoming bite."}
{"text":"My go-to food when I am starving and can't decide what to eat is always Thai food - Pad Thai to be specific.  I found Thai Seafood Ginger on Yelp and have had it delivered 1-2 times a week over the last 2 months.  Delivery is prompt, food is warm and it's decent Thai food.  I did stop in the other night for the first time.  The restaurant was nearly empty but it is tucked away in the corner of a strip mall and not the easiest place to find.  Service was great and all of the orders were correct.  I really like their fresh spring rolls, the hubby loves the crab rangoon and the Pad Thai is decent.  I really wish that they would bring back the Honey Limeade - because that was delicious!  Overall, it's a good place to eat and if you don't want to leave your house - delivery is a great option."}
{"text":"We came here based on yelp. 4 1/2 stars., you betcha it was  for the food and  for our server. Very attentive and a very positive. But the food was the best Thai experience! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Super happy that I live right down the street from here. Super good food, huge portions, and friendly staff. I always get the yellow curry and it's a little more on the soupier side but soaks up in the rice really nicely. My boyfriend gets the lemon chicken and he's said it's the best chicken he's had in a while."}
