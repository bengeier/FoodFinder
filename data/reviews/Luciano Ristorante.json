{"text":"La visite à ce restaurant est une expérience en sois. Les pates sont cuites a la perfection ,,,, mais le serveur est un pince sans rire qui vous jeteras hors des chantiers.... à visité de nouveau"}
{"text":"Ive been to this place quite a few times. Food has always been excellent.....service too. It can be a bit slow depending how busy it is. But than again this is a place to go for a long intimate dinner, not somewhere to go when youre in a rush, bring your own wine to drink while you wait, and if you finish the bottle you can run across the street to the depanneur for another one lol. Great pasta and salad. Should be noted that pasta is the only thing they serve as a main course. Not the place to go if youre doing the low carb or no crab thing. Highlight is the ambiance and decor, very cozy, quaint and romantic"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite pasta places in montreal ! The restaurant has lovely ambience, and the owner is so cute and quirky as well! 
The way you order is that first you decide your pasta sauce choice, and then decide which type of pasta you want
We asked about wine options, and I think it was BYOW, but there was a dep right across the street and if you're unsure about what to get, the  owner has recommendations as well.
There's so many pasta sauce options that my friends and I took forever to decide (as usual), but I finally opted for the bow tie pasta with marinara, bacon, mushrooms, grilled chicken, white wine, and cream and it was delicious! I also tried a bite of my friends clam (and I don't remember what else) linguini, which was very tasty as well. 
Portions are generous, and my friends and I food comaed for at least half an hour after we finished eating  
The owner was super funny because he'd always tease us with desserts before he brought them to the table which ordered them 
Definitely coming back here again hehe"}
{"text":"The food here is just not that good. It's ok and edible.. not more. The owner is a bit of a character."}
{"text":"Came here a few times with my boyfriend when he still lived in the area. Honestly, best Italian restaurant...all the pasta is great. This place specializes in pasta, so don't expect any pizzas or anything. You can't go wrong with any.They have I think over 30 different kinds of pasta including seafood, vegetarian, traditional etc. Presentation is really well done too! Ambiance is great, low lighting (romantic!) small (so reserve!) and service is excellent.. Our waiter drew on my mat what the types of pasta were because I didn't know the difference since the names were unfamiliar to me. (ex. rotini/linguini etc) I was a total pasta noob back then.  Anyway he was very sharp and witty, definitely knew his stuff. It's so inexpensive here I mean you can walk away with a full stomach for less than $20. Some pasta are more expensive but its not by much. This little Italian spot is worth checking out. It's right next to Verdun metro about 1 minute away. So it's very convenient. Go here if you are a pasta lover! Oh and btw it's a mom and pops kind of place."}
{"text":"If i could give this place a big fat zero star, i would. Where do i start??? I've had bad service. I've had bad food. But never did i have both with a dab of misogynistic and racist behaviour from the owner! I am not a violent person...but omg i wanted to punch him!

The menu is long and everything on it is expensive. We ordered two green salads. Felix ordered a fettuccini olive oil and garlic sauce for 13$!!! At that price, we thought that the ingredients would be top notch. Right? Wrong! I got the spaghetti meat ball. No \"s\". It was A meatball. The owner flat out asked my husband, because he doesn't talk to women, if his Chinese immigrant friend knows what ground BEEF meat was. My husband told him that he could ask me himself. The owner said he didn't bother because he knows i wouldn't understand him. I speak three languages. He then wrote down our plate numbers on paper table setting. What a schmuck! He wasn't shy on telling us that he buys his ingredients (fake parmesan, bread, salad dressing and so on) at Costco. Nothing against Costco. But when you charge 13-20$ a plate of pasta with sauce from a jar, i think you're ripping us off and taking us for idiots! I can go on and on... He also told my husband that we're better eating the whole thing because he will not let us have doggy bags. Food this nasty, no f-ing way! 

Worst meal of my life! Worst place ever!"}
