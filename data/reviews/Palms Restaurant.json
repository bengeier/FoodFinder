{"text":"SO good! The food was incredible & the desserts were the best I've had in a long time! The staff were very friendly & helpful in telling us about the items. We live 45 min from there, but will still make the trip for some good middle eastern food!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try out this restaurant, and I hate leaving bad reviews, but I was extremely disappointed with my dinner, especially given the stellar ratings it had so far. Much less food than I'd expected for the price. The kufta was extremely bland and very dry... so little flavor that the lettuce in the sandwich completely overpowered the kufta."}
{"text":"From the food, sweets and service everything is excellent! Best in town and they also cater to large events and parties! Not to mention the staff is extremely friendly! Food is very flavorful, delicious and mouthwatering. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"When for the baklava, they have a wide variety. They also have ice cream, cakes and a restaurant but I didn't get to try. Baklava sold per pound at a fair price. It was a little dry, not the best in town but it's a clean place."}
{"text":"Amazing food & great service. I used palms restaurant to cater my event for about 80 people and the food was fresh, hot and delicious. Everyone enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"I got the Gyro combo and the meat was very flavorful, generous portion, the sauce was really delicious. The salad was fresh, and the dressing (a balsamic vinaigrette, perhaps?) had a lot of fresh herbs in it. Seriously, that gyro was packed to the brim. Bread around it was warm and light. Good stuff."}
{"text":"I was looking for something different for a work lunch meeting- bored with the same old sandwiches and chips. I have picky eaters, meat lovers, and vegetarians to satisfy. I came across this place and ordered a family feast which came with a huge variety of veg items, salad, two kinds of rice, gyro meat, kefta kabobs, chicken and beef shawarma, pita, and falafel. Wow, everyone loved this food. I have to say it is the best falafel I've ever had, and the other vegetarians said the same thing. The meat eaters said the gyro meat was the best they've ever had. They certainly did not skimp on portions either! Along with delicious Mediterranean food there is also a bakery attached with a huge assortment of baklava and some beautiful cakes. The owners are very friendly and accommodating. I would recommend this place to anyone! A GREAT find!!!"}
{"text":"Great great great place!!! Fresh baklava, amazing service, great place. Coming back for more good food and definitely the desserts"}
{"text":"This is my third time coming to this restaurant, the food is really delicious and their prices are really good. The owner works there most of the time, he is really nice guy with a great customer service. I will definitely recommend if you were looking a Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some baklava for my wife. The place was clean and tidy. I also ordered a gyros sandwich. Food was really good and I'd like to try other things on the menu."}
