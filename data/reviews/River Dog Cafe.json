{"text":"This food was great! I stopped by because my girlfriend told me they had great root beer, and she was certainly right! I had the Grilled Chicken Pesto sandwich, which had a good smokey flavor to it, not to mention it was pretty large. We ate inside and the guy who took our order was very genuinely interested in helping us and making sure our lunch was a pleasant one. The prices were a bit higher, but the food was of a higher quality than what you would find elsewhere. Definitely worth it to stop by this cafe! I will be coming back to try a veggie dog soon!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place...I love the concept and the d√©cor & location are great.  But the food and service just fell short.  My husband and I dined in on a Sunday afternoon.  Not many patrons in the place.  However there was a table full of little children which I assumed belonged to a group of 4 sitting near them.  It wasn't long until I realized these were the children of the employees.  This also explained why they had overhead music playing AND the Disney channel on, volume all the way up.  I love kids but this was not an ideal dining experience.  I will say the hotdog itself was pretty phenomenal.  You could taste the quality.  However, the chili was terrible.  My dog came with a generous amount of chili with huge chunks of ground meat which I picked out.  The chips were really good.  We also ordered the tots covered in chili & cheese.  The cheese sauce is awesome but again, the chili is terrible.  For a lunch of 2 hot dogs, chips, pop & an appetizer we paid $28...a bit high for a so-so hotdog lunch."}
{"text":"Very good food. The hoagie style \"REUBEN\" had massive explosive flavor ! The in house brewed Root Beer was very good. If I don't go back,and take someone with me......I should be shot! Try it,you will like it."}
{"text":"Great place for the whole family. The food is very casual, but done well. My kids cant get enough of the hot dogs. The other menu options are very tasty too. Also, the people that work here could not be nicer every time I go in. Not easy to find a place that is truly family friendly, while keeping it pleasant and relaxing for the adults at the same time. They do a really nice job."}
{"text":"Great little spot with hearty options. I went here for breakfast and ordered the River DogHash, which was phenomenal (Corned beef, crispy potatoes, roasted red peppers, with a sunny side egg on top & sourdough toast). For the price, I felt like the portion should have a been a little bigger, but the service was incredibly fast, friendly and I left with a full stomach. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I get take out from here almost weekly.  The hot dogs are excellent, my favorite being the Windy City Dog and the Chili Dog is ridiculously messy and delicious.    As good as the hot dogs are, the sandwiches are even BETTER.  The Cleveland Beef and Brisket are both delicious but my favorite is the River BLT.  The thick cut bacon is grilled perfectly and even though tomatoes aren't in season the veggies were very good when dressed in lemon rosemary aioli.  But the absolute BEST part is the fried egg, which adds a wonderful \"sauce\" to the sandwich.  I'd LOVE to see their version of a Croque Madame!  For sides, I usually order the tater tots (who doesn't love tots?) or the home-made mac and cheese!  Yes, this is NOT a cheap hot dog stand.  But given the quality of ingredients and the expert level of preparation I wouldn't expect these to be \"dollar dogs\".    As mentioned I get take out instead of dining in.  Their dining room is very \"family friendly\" with coloring books and comics available to the kids, which is GREAT but just not my speed.  I'd prefer to just grab and go.  I've not tried their breakfast menu yet but have heard good things about it.    This is such a great sandwich place!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great veggie dog with 3 bean chili and slaw that hit the spot. Service was fast and friendly. Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"So disappointed after i went there after seeing them on New Day Cleveland.  Hot dog was tiny and not very warm -- chili looked like something in a can.  I had to return what they called lemonade - no flavor.  The waitress was very nice.  I would not recommend, and I will not go back."}
{"text":"This is a hot dog joint, a fancy hot dog joint, but still a hot dog joint. Go in with that expectation a you won't be disappointed.  Fantastic hot dogs especially for someone looking for something different. We didn't have anything bad and prices were reasonable. Solid work River Dogs!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I even went to the same place I read about here on Yelp ...when I arrived it was empty;  the fries to start out are not fresh cut ! The buns are not even steamed and the truffle dog with bacon we both agreed tasted funky bad! I thought it would be like a glorified awesome sandwich shop but turned out to be totally average run by young guys playing loud music... Is every place west of the Rocky River Bridge just frozen average food seems that way."}
{"text":"Had the crispy duck sandwich and cleveland beef - both were awesome and staff was great"}
{"text":"Tried River Dog for the first time for dinner last night. Definitely will be back again!  It's difficult to find good, healthy simple food to takeout, but this place delivers.  Had the River Mix Wrap + chicken. Ingredients were fresh; chicken was cooked perfect and not dry. Very flavorful. Plus, the wrap was huge! The same size as a chipotle burrito.   While the prices may be slightly high ($11 for my entree), the freshness and quantity of food merits the cost.   I am looking forward to trying a hot dog as that is their main attraction."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with my daughter at River dog. The hotdogs were outstanding. The place was clean and the workers were very friendly and accommodating. If you are in the mood for a good hotdog and friendly atmosphere I would highly recommend this place. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"After trying their delicious mac and cheese at the Mac and Cheese Throwdown, I decided to give this place a try. Went for Sunday brunch and unfortunately did not have a great experience. Ordered the beef brisket hash and it was very greasy without much flavor. The service was somewhat questionable as well. As the mainstay of the restaurant is the hot dogs, I must say the menu options looked good and as mentioned before, the mac and cheese is great. The owner is definitely passionate about delivering good food and creating a good atmosphere and it shows."}
{"text":"...Meh!  I ordered the Rockin' Out with My Guac Out dog and the  Lemonade. I wasn't impressed; I didn't see what all the fuss is about however, I Do have to say the staff was great!"}
{"text":"Dogs were decent although rather mushy (why is it so hard to find a dog with a little crispy snap to it in Cleveland?). The sign said \"house made chips and a pickle.\" I got cheap prepackaged chips and no pickle. I wouldn't come into your business and take something without paying, so why did you take my money for something without giving me goods in return? Seems like theft to me. Feel free to skip River Dog, you won't miss much."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs- their chili is pretty dang good too, although I guess I like mine a little spicer. The root beer is amazing- an absolutely necessary addition to any meal here. I'd definitely come back here again as I'm anxious to try out their full menu."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at River Dog Cafe for the second time, this place has some solid hot dogs.   I got the Polish Boy, a Cleveland tradition, but instead of the fresh kielbasa I just got a regular hot dog. I absolutely loved combo of the house slaw with the fries and hot sauce. The hot sauce is so spicy my mouth was on fire but I ate the entire thing--I couldn't help myself.   My boyfriend got the Adam Bomb. Which is a hot dog topped with beef brisket (that's really tender), bacon, creamy cheddar cheese sauce, and fresh herbs. I had a bite of his it was also delicious.   The prices are reasonable too, my hot dog was 5$ and the other was 6$.   My boyfriend is also obsessed with the root beer there. I don't like root beer to begin with but he gets excited about it lol.   The first time I ever went there I got the Chubalub. It had a heaping load of macaroni and cheese shells on top of it, and a fried egg. It was amazing. I can't wait to try something new next time!"}
{"text":"Incredible experience! Have tried many things off their menu and have been impressed each time. It's counter service but the wait time is very short and staff is accommodating.   Their one employee, believe his name is Tyler, was great helping to explain their menu and everything they offered. All around fantastic experience and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sometimes in life, you just can't decide if you want a hog dog or a healthy salad. Luckily, there's a place that can meet your indecisive needs - River Dog Cafe!  My husband and I stopped there for lunch today and decided to eat in. We got the Cleveland Beef which was on special ($9.50 for brisket sandwich topped with fried pickles plus a homemade sauce - and chips and a drink are included) and the River Mix salad (mixed greens and spinach with red onion and goat cheese and you can adds meat - I did and it was $11, which also included a drink and chips).  What we liked: - The sandwich was perfect. Grilled bun? Check. Amazing sauce that didn't overpower but added some pizzazz? Check.  - Greens were fresh and chicken was organic.  - Interior. Cozy diner style seating and it's not too big, not too small. Vintage toys and signs for decor is a nice personalized touch.  - Service! Super helpful, friendly and prompt. We ate in, and we only waited for about seven minutes for our food to be prepared. Options: I could have made my salad into a roll or wrap for the same price, and all the salads come with that option.   What we didn't like: - I would have given it 5 stars, but felt it was a bit on the higher end of pricing for a lunch. For two adults, we paid about $22.   Overall, this is a great casual dining spot in River, for professionals on a lunch break or family dinner. And they must be doing well, because they're expanding - they are now offering meal preparation in family size portions.   We will be back to explore all of the options!"}
{"text":"I ordered the brisket sandwich. The toasted bun was burnt at the edges and I received more gristle than meat. I was not at all happy with it. Had I ordered in the store instead of through a delivery service, I would have sent it back. The fries were good."}
{"text":"River Dog  At a glance it looks like a cool new hip hot dog joint just popped up in Rocky River. Dogs with great toppings. But don't be fooled. At a location that is wanting of something great and different, River Dog falls short on flavor, technique and style.     Let me start with the easy part. French Fries! Every cooking show on the food network  shows you how to make them. Food trucks and county fairs can master the art of crunchy and salty. However, River Dog makes little soft tasteless pillows. They boast of organic angus. While im sure an organic fed angus hotdog might find a way to be good, with proper toppings. Im not sure its worth the time or the price tag. Give me a snappy, properly grilled or deep fried hot dog and all its fat. It's the flavor and snap that im after. Ok, now thats resolved. Let us move on to the bun. Too much bun and kinda gummy. I think they use an orlando sandwich bun. The proper dog should be delivered on a light bun. slightly soft and specific to hot dogs. The delivery should never be overwhelming like a bus or a truck, but rather a beach comber slowly and gently dropping you off at the local bar.    I thought the topping lacked in flavor. My wife's dog was topped with rubbery bacon. I got a chili style dog. I believe that the chili was made by an Irish women that refused to use salt, pepper or any other ingredient related flavor.    Seems they wanted to decorate the place. Well that didnt work out so well either. I think the \"All Over the Place\" movement was what they wr going for. They nailed it, and to the wall. Next to a small framed Yoda, sits three italian cook books surrounded by candle stick holders and a random mid 70's action figure. Every little grouping of decorations suggests \"4 family garage sale\" this Saturday!!! in Parma!!!  Im giving them time to grow into the new space. But in the meantime, they should take a day off and head to Scooter Dogs in Mentor. The decor is cool, but you only notice it while you wait in line, not while you eat."}
{"text":"Its so nice to have a local restaurant that has fresh food!  Christian and his staff have done a fantastic job bringing goodness to Rocky River:)  I love that I can grab breakfast (quinoa oatmeal is fantastic) or lunch, then take home a Bake for dinner!  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"In this restaurant quality and personality this place is tops! I lunched there last Friday after a few friends raved about it. Great IPAs on tap, nice selection - much more than hot dogs! You should check it out. It's nice to support local. They may start offering special prices for Rocky River High School students that get off campus lunch in Junior and Senior year soon per the owner. Best deal for off campus lunch near our high school."}
{"text":"Great cozy atmosphere, awesome staff, and some of the best food to be found! Hidden back in a plaza, it's easy to see from the road, but you definitely have to be looking for it. I had a duck BLT and it was to die for! They also have draft root beer and great items for kids! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I had heard from a few friends that this place was well worth the visit. I must say I was not disappointed. I was immediately surprised by the great atmosphere and trendy decor. This was followed by prompt and friendly service. The hot dogs have several unique and creative blends of flavor with abundant toppings that are both filling and delicious! Lastly, the overall value for the money spent is difficult to beat."}
{"text":"For all of the things I hear about River Dog, I was highly disappointed. Started off with \"chili\" I put it quotes because it was not chili. It was gross ketchup like tomato sauce with ground beef in it. I asked for cheese and sour cream on it no onions and got a mound of onions and sour cream instead. I had a Windy City dog as well, and I think if they were trying to steam the bun they over did it. It was just a wet soggy bun, that was very unappealing. I don't feel the need to ever go back. Way to expensive for a meal I didn't eat."}
{"text":"I loved their food truck options over the summer and I am always game for a good hotdog so naturally I was excited to give this place a try. My friends and I stopped here for lunch in a summer and we were loving all of the menu options. We all opted for a build your own dog, and after many minutes of deliberating which toppings would be best we all placed our orders. The service was speedy and we were soon enjoying our delicious dogs all paid with their tasty homemade chips.  You have the option to sit down with your group or grab grub to go at their counter. They do have bar menu and offer a full bar selection. This was a great place to lunch and has some eclectic decor but I see it more as a restaurant/family friendly and not as a night out at the bar sort of establishment.  I will definitely be back to try out more delicious dog and maybe this time around I'll grab a beer to round out the meal."}
{"text":"i really didn't like River Dog Cafe. The chili tasted like nothing but sweetened canned tomatoes. the Polish Boy was the worst I've ever had. The sausage - which didn't appear to be or taste anything like kielbasa (as advertised) - was deep fried into oblivion. the Cuban dog i got was pretty good though, so not a total loss.   Not likely I'll be back. This'd be a one star or less review if not for the Cuban dog."}
{"text":"Excellent smoked brisket! Fast service, Kid friendly, and delicious huge menu!"}
{"text":"Never been disappointed. Jenny Dog is probably my favorite. Can't wake to actually wake up one morning (I work nights so this might be difficult) and try the breakfast tacos. Only possible complaint is after hot dogs and mac n cheese, dipping fries into their aioli can get a little salty."}
{"text":"Caught their food truck in Downtown Cleveland for lunch. Was told I had to get a \"Polish Boy\" while in \"The Land\"! The sandwich did not disappoint and the service was supper quick for a truck! Well done!! Too bad they won't be there Friday when I'm back downtown!"}
{"text":"I've been tempted to try this out for awhile, but never did until this weekend.  I'm sorry I haven't, because the place is really good!  It's a cozy little space, with a friendly staff.  A perfect place for families, too.  In fact, it's got one of the best kids' menus around.  The place must be run by parents, because the kids menu is a greatest hits collection of what kids like!  But the grownups aren't neglected, either.  We only had hot dogs, but they were great!  The dogs themselves were extremely good, but the toppings were out of the world!  I had a Chicago-style Windy City which I enjoyed, and my wife raved about her Jenny Dog, which featured brie, bacon, and a honey truffle glaze.  And we both loved the tater tots!  Why can't more places have tater tots?!?  Parking is a bit tight right now as everyone is trying out Bomba, in the same shopping strip, but don't despair... And don't delay getting to River Dog!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It is my favorite spot to get lunch or brunch with my kids and mom. It is super kid friendly with coloring books and crayons in a box by the register, at a level my 3 yo can help himself to. They have organic milk and juice boxes, fair trade coffee and grassfed, uncured hotdogs! He also uses Gerber chicken which is definitely a step up from general diner fare. I think they have a vast, inventive menu that offers lots of choices. I personally enjoy getting the Buffalo chicken bowl. The prices are really great, especially given that they use quality ingredients. You can take a couple of friends or family out and take care of the bill without taking too hard a bite out of your wallet. I hope it sticks around, I think it is a great addition."}
{"text":"Tomato on the caprese sandwich was not ripe and so I took it off and there was barely any taste to the sandwich.. A thin slice of cheese and a few pieces of spinach.. I didn't taste any pesto at all!!! For $7 I was not impressed.."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday around noon with wife, 3 family's in there eating, bar was empty so we sat there. Bartender was prompt and polite, got us our requested Beers, $6.00 each. I ordered the derby dog $6.50 add raw onion extra $50 . Wife ordered off the build your own menu\" cause there's no Kraut dog on the main menu. with krout onions and stadium mustard. $7.50. We split an order of tots. $4 My derby dog was definitely sitting around in a pot of water just soggy musty soaked right through the bottom of the barn. Chili was OK a little sweet for my taste but would've been fine if the dog wasn't so repulsive. Wife had the same opinion. Kraut was good, onions were fresh , the dog just soaked right through the bun big plate of mess. Tater tot's were cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly. House chips a bit salty but crispy and fresh. At five dollars for a plain hotdog I'll go to the hotdog stand next time."}
{"text":"Love the Cuban dog and the tots! I'm not sure if they still have the root beer on draft but it was great! Check out the cool nostalgic toys, lunch boxes and stuff all over the walls."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here for lunch during a cross-country drive. The kids' menu offers tasty and healthy options. My breaded walleye sandwich was delicious. There's a stack of coloring books and crayons to keep the little ones busy. Prices all very reasonable. Glad we found River Dog, instead of settling for fast food on the Turnpike!"}
{"text":"Finally got to check out this restaurant after spotting their food truck a couple of times this summer. Came on Father's Day - liked the casual, seat yourself vibe. Had live music too by a very talented singer. Lots of TVs if you want to watch sports.  We all ordered a mix of dogs and sandwiches and everyone enjoyed their meal. The tot-chos were a fun surprise - tasty albeit a little messy (fork required). Good kids menu too!"}
{"text":"Food truck catered my son's 11th birthday party and it was OUTSTANDING! The adults loved it, the kids loved it and the food and service were really amazing. This was no typical food truck. Very satisfied!"}
{"text":"Hiding in a quiet little plaza and disguised as a hot dog place is this adorable cafe. Gourmet hot dogs is the staple here, but they also have wraps, entrees, and sandwiches.  You choose your hot dog (regular,  brat, veggie, bison, etc) then choose one of their fancy creations or build your own. The buns are tasty and fresh. No dry crumbly buns here. Toppings are fantastic.  And the veggie dog mimics the taste and texture of the real thing.  Breakfast is also delish.  The breakfast tacos are served on three corn tortillas stuffed with egg, chorizo, potatoes, and tomatillo salsa. Flavorful and fresh. The quinoa bowl is filled with fresh fruit and topped with cinnamon and sugar. Kind of like a protein packed oatmeal. The sausage egg sandwich has some sort of creamy/spicy deliciousness on it and its held together with a soft and flaky brioche bun.   It's counter service here but everyone has been super friendly and happy. Food comes out pretty fast, so if you're in a hurry or super hungry, no worries there. Also seems like a cool place to bring kids. What kid doesn't like hot dogs? They even have a kids menu with kid sized hot dogs. And the parents can make the kids happy while also enjoying real food themselves. And prices are very reasonable. You definitely won't break your wallet here."}
{"text":"Total gem this place is tucked away in a plaza. The dogs are beefy and large. Prices are extremely reasonable.  I don't think you can wrong with any of the menu dogs. The draft Abita root beer is a must have!!! I will definitely  be returning."}
{"text":"Great dog, many different varieties to choose from or you can build your own dog.  Other items available as well as my wife had a sandwich called the VegiMagic with tomato bisque soup.  Chili cheese fries were really good, wanted to eat the paper underneath them that was covered with cheese and chili. However my wife was against that.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"First time dining in at River Dog Cafe in Rocky River today. Walked in and was immediately greeted and the hostess gave me the heads up to pick any seat preferably one closer to one of the small space heaters. Unfortunately for River Dog they were having some HVAC isssues at the time and service techs were working on getting the heat back up and running. The ambiance has a kinda garage funky look that felt right for this type of establishment, casual but cool.   I decided to try the daily special dogs one Chilly Dog and a Windy City (Chicago style) hot dog. Wait tile was minimal for my order and both hot dogs came out well loaded with toppings. The hot dogs were well grilled and had a nice taste to them. The only problem I had was loosing toppings while trying to eat the dogs. Service was prompt and polite and I had a enjoyable lunch, even though the dinning room was a bit chilly."}
{"text":"I had a breakfast sandwich (egg, bacon, cheese, pickle on texas grilled toast) served w/what tasted like home-made waffle potato chips ($6) on 12-17-16 at River Dog Caf√©.  Because I was in the mood for breakfast and this appeared to be the single breakfast item, I didn't have high expectations; however, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a really good and hearty breakfast.  It was served right off the grill, so it was as hot as could be expected, and it was way, way, way better than any breakfast sandwich I've had at any fast food place.  The interior of the restaurant is very stark and cold feeling to me.  The noise level was very low when I was here as there were only a few customers at 11:45am.  I imagine it gets kind of noise in here as the place fills up.  The coffee was super fresh and very strong (good) and the place appeared to be clean, including the restroom.  Service was as good as could be.  I would definitely return here, but next time I will order the crispy duck sandwich, which at $12, is something I've not seen on any menu, and it looks like a fantastic treat."}
{"text":"Extremely good! Looking for a local place to get a bite before heading to my next jobsite and this popped up. Well worth the 8 minute drive from westgate for really good breakfast tacos and burritos as well as awesome hot dogs. I really recommend the adam bomb or build your own. Brisket kielbasa or brat and bavon with siracha mayo is a man's best friend!"}
{"text":"Sitting here enjoying my chicken salad and have to say as it is getting more crowded it didn't seem to phase the staff... They remain smiling and very customer oriented.   The register girl jen was very informative and smiley and I met the owner...what a nice guy.   Oh and did I mention great food!!!"}
{"text":"Food not very good, was missing a lot of the ingredients listed. And for almost $10 an item, with no sides, it was severely overpriced. Coffee was gross. Good atmosphere and staff."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here for lunch. I was going to go with a hotdog but after looking at the whole menu I was convinced to try something else. I was in Hog Heaven after devouring the Crispy Duck BLT. It was both sweet & savory!! I also got a side of homemade slaw.. It was good too but the portion was skimpy. The side of slaw was only $2 but come on...it's chopped cabbage and carrots. But the size of the sandwich more than made up for it. Can't wait to dine here again!"}
{"text":"Took my boys (10 and 11) here last night for dinner. Big menu and hard to choose. One would be hard pressed not to find something appealing.  Kids menu expansive and new. My son who doesn't like fries or catsup said both were delicious. The ingredients were fresh and the combinations unique. Not all hot dogs as I thought. Many healthy alternatives like tuna salad. Service very friendly. Few beverages, but the rootbeer on tap was delicious. Could use some sweets to finish it off, but I didn't miss it. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"This place rocks. Don't let the title of a hot dog shop fool you. The Brisket Sandwich is awesome. The hot dogs are great, dare I say better than Happy Dog?  Yeah, hands down, some of the best hot dogs in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Nice location and vibe in Rocky River. Nice , people with great food. Rocky River is s bit uppity and this place is great as u feel welcome . Love the menu and we had a great experience . We will be back"}
{"text":"Great local spot, River owned, best place to run into all your neighbors and their kids.  New expansion is great!  All new tables and chairs, roll-up glass garage door let's all the summer air in.  Hands down best hot dog spot, bigger buns allow tons more toppings!  New expanded menu and full service wine, beer and liquor makes it a full service restaurant now."}
{"text":"Great veggie dogs I like their veg dogs better than happy dog Got it with rockin out with my guacamole toppings Yum  Needs to improve on atmosphere In a strip mall but hey gotta start somewhere"}
{"text":"this was my third time there, always get the windy city or something like that (chicago style dog) and it was good.  my son got some specially made hamburger he ordered on the order pad.  TWO patties to his suprise.  Live music thursday  very casual, business seems to be picking up for them too!  Keep it going!"}
{"text":"Traveling thru with my wife found this place on Yelp!  Great bratwurst with peppers onions spicey mustard and catsup... Really good Wife had hotdog/ Windy City their version of Chicago dog.   Food and service along with very clean Restaurent make for a good dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is excellent.  So many options and everything I have tried here has been delicious.  Fresh ingredients made to order in a clean little cafe with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Saw on Yelp that they had brunch, so went in late Sunday morning. I got the beef brisket expecting the cole slaw to be on the side, but the sandwich was smothered in it. The brisket itself was OK, but lacking flavor. I also found the overcooked \"chips\" to not be a very good accompaniment--since when are potato chips ever better than fries?  My fiancee had a different sandwich (can't remember what it was) and was also disappointed."}
{"text":"I think River Dog Cafe is the perfect example as to why you should give a place a second try. My first time here I was meh about the food, second time around however I find myself much more pleased with everything! I've actually been back about half a dozen times I like it so much.   Their hot dogs are nice and plump; I usually get the Adam Bomb with brisket and cheese sauce, but I ask them to remove the bacon and add coleslaw right on the dog. This makes it so much more tastier, so although a little messy, it's definitely worth it. The cheese seems different as well, or maybe since they don't use foil anymore to wrap up the to-go dogs there is no longer the problem of the cheese sticking to the foil.   The fries are the same, still frozen, but made to look like fresh cut fries so they are the best of the frozen kind in my opinion. I really enjoy dipping them in the red pepper aioli. I did try the loaded fries with chili (meat sauce), cheese sauce and sour cream, but unfortunately I did not care for them. I still have a thing against their chili (meat sauce), it's just too sweet.   The staff here are always pleasant, and for less than $10 you can get a big loaded hot dog with a side which is plenty enough to fill you up for hours. I would recommend River Dog Cafe! Next time I think I'll try a rootbeer float and their mac & cheese."}
{"text":"This place is  a hidden gem in the plaza next to Mitchells by the CVS. We went in the other night with the baby to try them out. We will be back! My hubby and I both got hotdogs. Mine had mac & cheese with a fried egg and his had brisket & bacon. After a bite of his I was kicking myself for not ordering the brisket sandwich special they had, but now I know what to order next time. The fries were yummy! The service good and quick which is important when dining with the kiddo. The food was quick, yummy and I am still thinking about it. I recommend you go here now, before it becomes the next Melt or happy dog and you need to shank someone before you can get seated without a wait. Discover it now, so you can say you knew about this place before everyone else did!"}
{"text":"Had this place on my radar for a while, convinced hubby to try it for lunch yesterday. Love the space and the funky decor! Also, it smells phenomenal when you walk in! I ordered a Danger Dog (bacon-wrapped, all beef hot dog topped with jalape√±o relish and house-made cheese wiz) and a side of tots. Hubby had a bacon cheeseburger because, as he says, \"I'm just not really a hot dog guy.\" Well, he missed out!!! Excellent dog, but they brought me the wrong one first!!! Quickly corrected, but I was starving!!! Will go back to try some other specialty hot dogs soon!"}
{"text":"love this place. lots of healthy and delicious food! I highly recommend the buffalo chicken salad, the chicken salad wrap, the Mac and cheese, the blt, and any breakfast sandwich . ingredients are fresh. staff is friendly and accommodating. I'm on a restricted diet, And its so easy for me to eat here because everything is healthy, wholesome and tasty! the all beef hot dogs are delicious. kid friendly too. root beer on TAP!"}
{"text":"Found the menu for River Dog at the Rocky River rec center and thought it looked really good. Decided to try it today.   I ordered the polish boy and it was AMAZING! The kielbasa was really good. The thing was huge! David got 2 hotdogs. One deep fried and the other one just regular. I stole a bite of the deep fried and have decided that the next time I go, I will get one of those.   I really wanted to try the duck BLT, so I ordered it to go for lunch tomorrow. I couldn't resist nibbling on it a bit and it was wonderful as well. You can tell they put a lot of thought and preparation into their food. Totally surprised at how affordable it was as well.   This is my new favorite hot dog place. Totally blows happy dog away and you don't have to deal with rude hipster either!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch over the weekend and it was disappointing. I ordered the shortrib hash and it was lacking seasoning, potatoes seemed really old and the over easy eggs were cooked all the way through. We also ordered a hot dog and it was cold in the middle. Won't be going back anytime soon. There's too many good places like the hot dog diner and happy dog in town to have mediocre food at best. Only reason they get a second star is the dining area seemed clean."}
{"text":"Healthy choices, friendly staff, warm atmosphere with 80's themed decorations. Had the veggie magic wrap and quinoa salad and both were delicious! We will be back again soon. Saw some hot dogs that looked like large portions and hit jealous!"}
{"text":"Each time, I find something that I like.  Their tots are fabulous.  We rarely have to wait to order.  Food is prepared custom.  Also, they offer great Sunday brunch features (whatever the kitchen feels like making, may be biscuits with country sausage gravy, or maple french toast.)  Reliable and good.    Also, last summer the River Dog food truck was a huge hit at my neighborhood block party.  Super company to work with for events."}
{"text":"Quick, yummy, great family place! To my delight, the menu was much more diverse than expected but I ordered a hot dog anyway -- the Cuban dog was perfection! Tater tots automatically put this place on my favorites list and I'll definitely be back to sample more...can't wait!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing location!  The food is incredible.  I love the Jenny Dog... it has brie cheese, bacon and a honey truffle glaze.  I was skeptical, but the salty and sweet was amazing.  I don't really like hotdogs... but I have been wanting to go back & craving them!   Oh... and the Mac & Cheese.  You need to try it.  It's not the fake american tasting stuff.  It's like cheesy goodness.   Tater tots were great... not a huge portion, but they were that crispy tot that I was hoping for."}
{"text":"i thought this place was cute. you order at the counter and then they bring out your food (or you go back up to get it) but i had a breakfast wrap that was good. the potatoes on the side were truly delish.  as other patrons were coming in around lunch time, they were ordering the fries, which looked amazing in my opinion. i am a HUGE lover of fresh cut fries and these looked like they totally made the cut. (no pun intended :)  if you are looking for a quick something i would stop in and at least try them out. i do want to go back for the fries and try one of their hot dogs!"}
{"text":"Derby dog and homemade root beer were unbelievable! The place had a laid back and comfortable atmosphere. Great service and can't wait to head back!"}
{"text":"Went in today, around 1:30 for a late lunch with my parents. We walked in and sat ourselves only to wait seven minutes for the server to even acknowledge us. She still didn't acknowledge us after 7 minutes, with a not so busy dining room. So we ended up leaving and walking across the street to Herbs Tavern. Unfortunate that I didn't even get a chance to try this place due to oblivious and inattentive service.   EDIT: I am very understanding of busy restaurants but I would not consider having her back turned to the dining room as busy as she was laughing with the line cook."}
{"text":"Root beer on tap! Hot dogs a thousand different ways! What else do you need?? Good food for a reasonable cost and friendly staff. Be sure to check out their breakfast menu too."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  My boyfriend and I were getting a little under-stimulated by our regular haunts and decided, quite on a whim, to go here.  It's soooo good.  I recommend getting their mac & cheese on every create-your-own dog you make.  It's seriously the BEST mac and cheese I have ever had - of which I consider myself a connoisseur. I wish they had an option to just get the mac & cheese in a bowl - it's really that good."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets. Super friendly staff who walked us through the menu and even allowed us to sample some of the brisket and coleslaw. We both enjoyed the Chili Dog that was on special today and we were both extremely satisfied. Awesome food with an  awesome staff."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day.  I had the Cuban Hotdog.  Now, the Cuban is just about my favorite sandwich, and this had to be close to the best hotdog I ever had."}
{"text":"We were lucky to randomly drive by this place after not being able to get in to another local diner for brunch. We were so impressed by the quality of the food here! We all tried something different...my brisket and egg brioche sandwich was incredible. My friend's corn beef hash was perfect. My other friend gave the cook very specific instructions for her scrambled eggs and bacon and both were perfectly cooked to order!  We had such a great experience here...highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'll rework a Yelp cliche that I loathe for this review: I want to like this place more. In fact, I'll be returning in hopes of bumping this review up a bit. It's close to me, and quite promising. The food overall was solid, but it could be a lot better. The dogs themselves are very good, but I wish they were cased. The toppings are creative and the buns are good. Service is friendly. I tried the slaw and the pasta salad. Both were decent concepts that were let down by lack of seasoning. Salt would have done wonders, and some more herbs and spices would have taken bland dishes and made them pop. I enjoyed my meal despite these letdowns, and I look forward to returning to try more of the menu. I hope they find the saltshaker in the meantime."}
{"text":"The River Dog Cafe is tucked back in a smaller strip of stores in Rocky River.  Decided to check this place out on a Sunday afternoon. Looked to be two rooms to the place and one had a group of people gathered for a party. There was also a bar over there on that side but I never ventured back there.    I'm not a huge hotdog fan but it's in the name, so you've got to try one of their dogs. They've got about a dozen variations to try or you can build your own. I was drawn in by the Adam bomb, which is topped with brisket, bacon, and cheese whiz. It comes with chips and a pickle. I also ended up getting a side of chili cheese fries as well.   I had to laugh as soon as it came out.  The \"pickle\" was literally a single hamburger chip pickle on top of the waffle cut chips. It must have been a particularly wet one because it made a bunch of the chips soggy and I'm not a fan when restaurants do this. The chips were my favorite part of the meal. The hotdog itself was just ok. The toppings were great. I wish I could have made a sandwich of that alone! Fries were nothing spectacular.  Someone else has mentioned the chili being just 'meh' in their review and I agree. Was really hoping for more flavor or spice.   They really put me off when we went to pay for the tab. We bought the deal off of Yelp to pay $5 and get $10 off the total. They didn't want to honor it and said they weren't accepting those deals anymore. We had bought it online right before we entered the place.  It's still available on Yelp now! Apparently a previous manager had started the partnership with Yelp and it wasn't agreed on by the current management and they weren't sure how to end it. Eventually they took it off for us but with a clear distaste. I appreciate the local vibe of this place but they could do better."}
{"text":"Love this place! Service great, nice space. We had a chili cheese dog and the Windy City dog. Both delicious, huge and super fresh. Fries were great too, crisp and hot."}
{"text":"Had the danger dog combo that came with chips. Nice place, good hot dogs between  $6-8."}
{"text":"We love River Dog for a quick bite on the west side. Locally sourced meat in the dogs, no preservatives and all-around high quality ingredients used here. Try one of the signature dogs - my favorite is the Chubalub - mac and cheese and an over easy egg on top the hot dog. Delicious! Don't worry, there are a ton of different toppings to choose from if you're feeling inspired to create your own instead. The Polish Boy here is really on point as well. Tried the breakfast tacos the other day and although I've had better, they were quite tasty also. Old City Sodas are available along with the usual fountain drinks, and something you don't find too often - on tap root beer! Spicy, not too sweet and very refreshing.  River Dog started out with a food truck and still does a lot of catering - the catering menu looks amazing! Now they have the small storefront and are expanding into an adjacent space. A good sign for sure. Definitely stop in next time you're in the mood for some quick, delicious comfort food."}
{"text":"At noon on Saturday, it was partially full but not packed.  The menu looked innovative and promising but the restaurant didn't deliver.  All the tables were dirty, and it was easy to see why.  As we ate, no staff came out to wipe down tables that were self bussed.  I had the quinoa breakfast, and it was maybe a half cup of quinoa with a few slices of strawberry and 2 chunks of pineapple.  I felt robbed of my $6.  Plus, they were out of coffee and the fruit infused water tasted bitter...maybe it was the effect of cucumbers and the sun.  I probably would have given the place 2 stars as my friend's Jenny dog looked and tasted fantastic but a trip to the restroom makes it a solid one.  The smell of urine was so strong, I washed my hands, and waited to use the facilities at our next stop.  Gross...."}
{"text":"Love going here. The food is amazing! And the family atmosphere is very inviting. Now they even have expanded and have a Bar! Can we say new Friday hang out?!"}
{"text":"Nice update to space. Still great dogs and the chili cheese fries are addicting. Beers available too."}
{"text":"Met my husband here on a Saturday late morning after getting my pedicure at Liz Nails which is located right next door (see my review on Liz Nails as well.)  This is not a flashy place at all and the bar is really small but it is a cafe, not a sports bar.  Overall the atmosphere was nice and they were fairly busy that day.  Our server was nice and attentive.  My husband and I sat at the bar and had a beer and ordered hot dogs.  I had the Ida hot dog which was ok and I can't remember what my husband had although he said it was good.  He did mention however that it simply isn't enough food even with all the toppings on the hotdog - he felt like he could eat another to fill him up, but not for another $7.00!  That was why I knocked off one star.  Otherwise our sides, chips and tater tots were good.  It's a nice quiet place to stop in for a casual lunch."}
{"text":"Being out on a nice day with the kids, we decided to give this place a try for dinner. At first glance, it looked nice. The online description made it seem friendly for kids bit no kid menus provided. My husband & I each ordered specialty dogs, both alright.  We will not return."}
{"text":"I went here because I was feeling too lazy to cook something up at home. Plenty of parking outside. The place itself is nice and casual. You could bring 4 or so friends and have a table with no trouble. It's a small place, and they keep it very clean.   I took some time to order and the guy at the counter didn't mind explaining any questions I had. He told me of a deal they had going on for their tacos, so I got three chorizo tacos for $8. They are corn tortillas with a decent bit of the typical fillers inside. You can get bigger meals for $8, but I wasn't disappointed with the meal in any way. As I was waiting, apparently someone who ordered fries had left, so they offered them to me. Definitely got lucky there!  I'll be coming back here to check out the hotdogs. I was told that the chili cheese dogs were fantastic."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to give this place a second chance since the first time we went there and no one seemed interested in taking our order... so we left. Tonight we decided to give it another try since they expanded etc. we will not be back. I gave it one star because our server was a very nice young lady. The hotdogs tasted as they had been cooked for numerous hours and then re-grilled. We could not attempt to even get thru our meals let alone finish our meals. We ordered The Derby, Windy City and Chub- we wanted to be able to try a variety of items... however all inedible. We politely asked for our check and left."}
{"text":"Nice little place, we've been here a few times since its been open. Easy place to take kids, they have stuff for them while you wait, crayons and actual coloring books. Good fries and unique dogs. A bit expensive but the quality matches the prices."}
{"text":"My girlfriend wanted for us to go out after work for dinner and recommended us trying this joint. When I initially checked out the menu, I was put back as I am not a hot dog fan but they also had sandwiches and wraps/salads on the menu so I was good to go.   We went in on tonight (Wednesday @6) and it was not crazy packed which was refreshing to have some space. The place itself is a bit small but cozy and has a nice wacky decor. The menu is written on a chalkboard above the ordering counter.   Now to the food. We both ordered the buffalo chicken wraps. Cool thing is any salad mix can be made into a wrap. We also ordered fries and on tap root beer! We sat down at a small table and the owner himself brought us our meal which was a nice touch. The wraps were very good and very fresh. It tasted like someone made it with love. The fries were hot and crispy; one order is good for two people by the way. The on tap root beer was awesome!  What a refreshing addition to the food scene in Rocky River. Great food, very nice and welcoming staff, good for kids and awesome root beer! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had a party of 10 we sat ourselves the place was empty and it took the server 10 minutes to get our drink orders and then another 10 minutes to actually get our drinks. She then got the entire drink order wrong and gave everyone diet and not what they ordered. It was very unorganized and chaotic, I then ordered a bacon cheese burger and got greasy cheese wiz and bacon bites the burger was no better than a burger from Wendy's but the Burger alone cost $9 with a few chips as a side. I was very disappointed. As was majority or my party everyone said the food was \"just okay\". We will not be back."}
{"text":"A friend and I just had their veggie magic salad and their River Mixed Salad,  and both were delicious! I'd even hunting for an inexpensive place/diner with good salads in Lakewood and I'm happy to have finally found one!"}
{"text":"First visit, very satisfied. Bought the Derby (chili) and Windy (chicago) dogs and they were delicious. It often seems that the dog is the most forgotten part at many Hot Dog Joints but the meet was flavorful and distinct. No soggy Sabretts here.   I was surprised by the hoagie buns, but the bread was very good, and perfect for a lot of their very very tasty chili -- among the best I've tasted. The Windy probably should have been laid deeper and had a little more toppings. I'll be sure to ask for the celery salt next time.   Nice little cafe feel in there as well, was very inviting. Liked the free cucumber water dispenser, and let it be noted -- service was very quick despite several people placing orders and waiting."}
{"text":"Great little cafe, more than a gourmet hot dog place. They emphasize using local and all-natural ingredients. I went for breakfast and had the simple sandwich which is bacon, egg, cheddar and pickle slices on brioche. It was delicious. Their hash browns include a little bit of chopped, fresh rosemary. They had a pancake special for kids, and my daughter are them all up.   I'm looking forward to trying one of their dogs (made with Angus beef and no nitrates added), maybe the one with mac & cheese and a fried egg on top.  If you aren't into hot dogs, they have salads, wraps, and sandwiches too. Very cute little cafe and the service was super-friendly."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Super friendly staff, very fast, and healthy!  I got the veggie magic wrap and it was yummy!  :)  Glad to have found this hidden gem right around the corner from my work!  Will def become a regular here! :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place and I'm sad that it took me this long to find it. I had the dog with mac and cheese and it was excellent. Great flavor with the split top dog and the mac was good. I ordered a side of totes to go with it and they were some of the best tots I have had. Just the right amount of crunch. The draft root beer was a nice touch to round out the meal. My counterpart had the duck sandwich and it was awesome. I hope to get back her to try a few more things before I leave. Highly recommend if you like a good sophisticated dog."}
{"text":"I brought my nieces here today for hot dogs. We all loved the menu selections and enjoyed our food very much.  You can create your own dog if you wish!  Will definitely be coming back here again."}
