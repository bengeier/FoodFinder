{"text":"I highly recommend this place. I've always hated pizza. While growing up my parents would bring me pizzas from different halal restaurants that never tasted good & I just thought it was because it was halal (as Pizza Hut, pizza nova, etc.  were all waaaaaay better). I gave up on pizza, until one day I was craving beef pizza and decided to try it from here. I've only been 2-3 times and both the service & food has been phenomenal. My parents thought I started enjoying pizza again and brought a pizza from another local halal restaurant a week later. It was NOTHING compared to this. I attached two pictures with this post to show how pretty the pizzas were. I haven't tried the wings YET but I bet they are amazing. The only thing I do recommend is asking for a well done pizza, but other than that definitely 5/5"}
{"text":"Okay deserves 4.5 stars but gave it 5 cause it's close to a 5 than a 4. Their wings are the star of the show, hot sauce is great and I think they are grilled. The pizza was also good, I would request a well done pie next time. Woman that works there is very nice too. 

They now have a website

{"text":"The food is really good and the service exceptional. I had 8 wings, and a small chicken tandoori pizza for $20 including tax. The taste was phenomenal and the crust was just right. The owner made the BBQ wings right in front of me, and they were super tasty. I'd go back again. They have an Iftar buffet special I believe for $10 per person, but you should call ahead to reserve."}
