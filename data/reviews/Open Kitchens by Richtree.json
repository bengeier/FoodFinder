{"text":"I recently stopped by the Square One location for a quick lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. This was my first time back in a long time and I must say, I really enjoyed it.

I had a quarter piece of chicken re-heated on the grill with some delicious bbq sauce and some cold pasta salad. The total came down to around 11$ which is what I expected. Not too expensive, but fair. 

The food was great, chicken was hot and the pasta was nice and light. 
I had to resist going back for dessert...Thanks to my strong will power, I skipped on the opportunity but it was hard ignore my temptation.
The spread of treats they had on display was incredible. From pecan pie to freshly baked muffins, they had it all. I'll definitely give the desserts a try next time...

The \"Open Kitchen\" self serve concept is awesome. You're not limited to one type of cuisine here, they offer variety which is great for someone who can't decide on what they want to eat for lunch. 

The service was great from all the staff members including the bus boy outside the cafeteria. Happily cleaning tables and clearing dishes. 
I couldn't ask for a better experience.

I will definitely be back for more whenever I'm in the area."}

Added a salad of fresh greens with tabouleh, small pasta spirals, couscous and marinated mushrooms with a berry lemonade for a great pre-marathon meal. Fresh ingredients, clean, open kitchen, friendly service, fair prices.  Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"In a word: Horrible! I typically have good experiences with Richtree restaurants but that was not the case this time.

I was looking for a quick, cheap lunch and had originally went in planning on having their salad bar but when I saw what I got for $6.00, I soon decided it was not worth the money. I opted instead, for a hot dog and a drink  - $2.59 and $1.79 respectively.

The service I received from the young lad manning the grilling station was mediocre at best. He was clearly there to do just the bare essentials of his job and nothing more.

The condiment section also left much to be desired. Tomatoes, onions, relish, BBQ sauce, ketchup, hot peppers and pickles... that's it. Obviously geared more towards a burger than a hot dog. Anyway, I dressed my dog as best I could, grabbed my drink and off I went to find a table.

To be honest, I've had better hot dogs from street vendors. This dog had no flavour at all... well that's not entirely accurate, the charred remains of the skin provided a very unpleasant flavour and left a charcoal aftertaste!

I was very disappointed in my lunch and wished I had gone downstairs to the food court instead!"}
