{"text":"Love this place! I have tried several Indian restaurants in Calgary, & Moti Mahal wins, hands down. At this point I am considering not wasting my time trying new ones, although I am sure there must be good ones other than Moti Mahal & Raj Palace (NE).

I first visited in 2005, when my partner was moving into town & we arrived close to closing - they stayed open for us, letting us know it might be a bit slow because the staff were getting their dinners. Needless to say, not knowing the town at all & feeling so lucky to have found a great place to eat at 10 pm, we've been eternally grateful for their kindness that night. 

This place did have a few years of service problems, back when almost everyone in Calgary had service problems due to the low unemployment rate at the time. But Moti Mahal could train most other establishments on how to deal with screwups like lost orders and 1 hour waits.  They actually do their best to make it right, whether it is a free beer or an appetizer taken off the bill, PLUS they make their apologies sincere. I never feel like I am the problem when they mess up, & that is a talent that some other restaurants need to learn. 

Hmm, 4th paragraph already; maybe I should mention the food, eh? Moti Mahal serves an excellent selection of North Indian cuisine. My current faves on the menu are palak dal - seriously, the spices are so yummy that I will scrape every last bit off the plate - and the eggplant. We've brought numerous out of town guests here & everyone has loved their meals, regardless of what was ordered. 

They have recently renovated a bit to add a bench along the whole south wall, giving them more seating capacity. Reservations are still recommended for busy times. 

Restaurant is accessible, including a ramp on the left side of the parking lot. The corner of the ramp looks like it makes for a tight turn, but I have been assured by other customers that they had no trouble getting a chair around it. 

As other reviewers have mentioned, the parking lot is small & you may need to park in the lot on 16th Ave or scramble for street parking."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with friends the other night. The food was absolutely phenomenal. The food was simple and delicious. 

We ordered Butter Chicken, some Naan bread, Gobi Alu Matter, and some rice. I loved the Naan but I'm a sucker for bread. Each dish was piping hot and tasted so good. 

The service was also amazing. All of our dishes came out quickly after we ordered everything was hot and fresh. The smell of the food was intoxicating to be around. The portions were also just right I didn't feel over whelmed by a large helping of butter chicken and just the right amount of rice. 

I also liked that this location had a parking lot. As residents of Calgary know trying to find a parking spot on 17th Ave so a venue with parking is a HUGE plus.

I will have to come again and bring more friends to this awesome restaurant. The d√©cor was also very nice. It was a cozy restaurant not too big, not to small, a perfect venue for an intimate evening with friends."}
{"text":"Pretty simple review. Fantastic east Indian restaurant. Great atmosphere, staff and some really great dishes. We will be back for more."}
{"text":"This is hands down my FAV restaurant in Calgary. The food is incredible, try the prawns in papya curry with garlic naan bread! I get it every time, also they make a delicious mojito! I went there for my birthday and all my friends LOVED it. You should make a reservation to be safe because it usually fills up fast! It's a bit pricey but totally worth it and they way it is decorated down to the plates and cups is very ethnic and really cool!"}
{"text":"On the norm the gang at Moti Mahal treat you like royalty taking extra special attention to all the small details.

While I won't let one person ruin my favorite memories at this place, it does warrant enough to make a mention.

When we asked our server if she had any recommendations for a drink she coyly responded  \"check the drink list\" - not exactly a great way to start our dining experience that evening.

The food was great as usual - but that kind of service puts a bad taste in my mouth that makes me question whether I would take clients back."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has such great reviews... It was watered down, and little to no flavour. Won't be going back!!"}
{"text":"Got take out. Food was delicious, but the portions were a rip off. Got two $16 curries, a $5 saffron rice and $8 veggie pakoras expecting to maybe have some leftovers. It wasn't enough for two of us.

It's really too bad because as mentioned, food was delicious but I have found similar quality but better value elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been dining at the Moti, sometimes with long stretches between visits, for more than 20 years and it has always been my 'go to' place for a quality Indian meal with good service and a suitable atmosphere. The high quality of the meats used is what makes the Moti stand head and shoulders above their peers.

My typical dinner combination, shared with a companion, starts with a couple orders of perfectly golden fried and lightly seasoned onion-shaped samosas (2 Veggie + 2 Lamb). The lamb samosas can be a bit dry, but when eaten alongside the veggie samosas, with a light helping of chutney, they are fantastic.

The chicken vindaloo is made with chunks of tender breast meat. The sauce is, as expected with vindaloo, fiery, but the complex and subtle flavours of coriander, cumin and cinnamon aren't lost in a wave of sheer heat, although I still need a side of raita to take the edge off. This is easily my favourite dish at the Moti,

The lamb kofta, essentially ground lamb meatballs in a mild creamy, slightly sweet sauce, are a good counterpoint to the vindaloo.

No meal is complete without rice and the Alu Peas Pilau - Saffron rice tossed with peas and potatoes - does the trick nicely. Add an order of wonderfully light, yet chewy, garlic naan bread and you've got a great dinner for two.

Throw in a couple pints of IPA and chai martinis to keep things flowing and the whole thing comes in around $75 or so, which is money well spent as you won't find a better Indian meal in this city."}
{"text":"Been here once, loved it, will go back again soon. Lately, I've been dissatisfied with some of the other restaurants I usually visit. I decided to try something new!

This place has very dim lighting and Indian music in the background. I think this place is very well decorated - especially metal door fixtures on the wall. We got to drink out of what it looked like a tin cup? It felt like we were truly in India. 

I don't even know where to start with food. We ordered a thing of rice, shrimp something sauce (amazing), and spinach-cheese sauce. I think it's inappropriate to call them \"sauce\", maybe curry? I forget the names but I will revisit soon and edit the list of things to get there! 

Overall, had a wonderful time, there was a little delay from the server side,  taking good 5 minutes till he visited us for the first time. We were seated by the lady who was at the front. Otherwise, lovely, lovely, place to eat."}
{"text":"YOU HAVE TO GO HERE ! The food here is delicious we ordered the butter chicken , samosa, and naan. Our family loved everything . The service was the fastest service I've ever received at any restaurant . The owners and waiters are so generous. This was a very well priced restaurant and you should defiantly check it out ."}
{"text":"Anybody who says this place \"smells\" is simply not a Indian food lover, lol. Best Indian food I've had in Calgary HANDS DOWN. The Vindaloo is amazing if you love spice, and I mean real spice... The Palak is some of the best I've ever had, it's a spinach dish (looks gross, try it it's so good) I add potato instead of a meat and mix it with my rice or eat it with the naan bread. Little pricey for the portions but that's my only complaint. I've always had great experiences dining in or taking out. If you like Indian food I'm positive you will LOVE this place."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful, the food exceptional!  I recommend making reservations versus just dropping in.  There was a line up of 4 separate couples/groups waiting for tables when we arrived for our 7:00 reservation.  We were seated promptly upon arriving."}
{"text":"I am certainly not easy to please! But Moti Mahal, you impressed me!

We celebrated my friends birthday party here. The place was outstanding! They accommodated our group with ease, they were very courteous, very agreeable, the food was great, and the prices for the food and drinks were decent.

Love it! Thank you for making my friends party beautiful and memorable!"}
{"text":"What has happened? This used to be the BEST place for butter chicken in the city.  What I had a few nights ago was awful.  The chicken was rubbery, and there is NO way it was simmered in the sauce.  And the butter chicken sauce....it used to be SO good....now taste likes canned tomato soup.  The appetisers were good, but not out of this world.  What has happened?  This used to be a favourite of mine, but I will not be returning.  As another posted stated....they do not know the different between biryani and coconut rice.  SUCH a disappointment."}
{"text":"I discovered this place in 2005, best Indian Food in Calgary, trust me. I like eating at nice places and nothing, London and Edinburgh included, has Indian food as good as this place :) Great food, great service and great ambience. The absolute best!! :)"}
{"text":"Was in Calgary for the Stampede and had a craving for Indian. Good ambiance, food and service. Had lamb vindaloo, butter chicken, naan and veg samosas - all very tasty and good sharing between two of us. Also tried the masoor dhal and weren't fans but we'd never tried this dish at any Indian restaurant before so may just not be our thing. Not from the area so this is the only Indian place in Calgary I've tried but would definitely go back on my next visit."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Indian restaurant in Calgary, and among our favourites worldwide.

When we first moved to Calgary, we figured that Indian is always a safe bet for a vegetarian, so we did a review search for reviews and Moti Mahal came up top in the very few review sites that existed 6 years ago. Well, we arrived late, having driven through several snow storms on the Trans Canada from Vancouver, and arrived shortly before closing. We offered to head elsewhere, but they stayed open for us!

And this has been the theme for us--even on the odd occasion when some problem would crop up, they would always strive to make it right. So we have brought other visitors to Moti Mahal, and they always ask to go back (or become regulars themselves, if they wind up in Cow Town).

The food is delicious. We have ordered all over the menu, both vegetarian and the odd occasion I stray into the meat or seafood sections, and have never been disappointed. The vegetarian selections are extensive, in both the vegetable and pulses sections (their spinach lentils--palak dahl--is a favourite of ours). I think their tandoori chicken is among the best I've ever had. It's Kashmiri cuisine, with nods to western expectations, but they do not skimp on spicing. (If you can't handle spice, stay away from the vindaloo, which I find hot but easily managable, and I'm not exactly insensitive to capsaicin.)

Parking can be difficult. A tip: half a block north on 14th St., on the left at 16th Ave, you will see a green P lot just past the book store, ironically near the Green Chili (which is decent, but not in the same class as Moti Mahal)."}
{"text":"I wanted to try Indian food while in Calgary because I saw so many Indian in this city.  Yelp helped me to pick this restaurant.  

When we got into the restaurant, we were greeted nicely.  Our table was being prepared.  After 5 mins, we were seated.  Indian decoration is all over the place.  Our server did not come to our table not until 10-15 mins since we sat down.  We were ready to order and went ahead to order the food (roti, quarter chicken tandoori and lamb kashmiri based on her recommendation).  When the food arrived, we received more pieces of chicken than I thought.  Couldnt finish the food because it was plenty.  The taste is very good.  

When the bill came I was surprised that they charged half chicken even though we ordered quarter chicken.  Earlier, I also heard the restaurant owner apologized to the customers next to our table because the same waitress mistakenly took order.  It was not a big deal for me just because of the quality of the food.  I recommend to try this place if you want to taste some good Indian food."}
{"text":"Quality is decent, but I've had better in the city. The size of the portions is rather small, especially considering that the prices are higher than most other Indian restaurants in town. Service tends to be on the slower side as well. The upside is in the ambiance, which is intimate and upscale-feeling.

I live a few blocks away but don't come very often as I find this place rather expensive for what it offers. I would usually make the trip to Maharaja on 9th avenue for my fix of Indian food."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian cuisine. If your in the area you must stop by. Our waiter was also attentive and kind. 
-1 star... I would not say they are child friendly. 
*loved my coconut mojito mmm."}
{"text":"As I have said, I love Indian food, so when my friends suggested Moti's of course I was on board!  

We go to the restaurant early, so we were the first of many people to start trickling in.  The inside of the restaurant has a great atmosphere, very well decorated and lit nicely.  We received a friendly greeting and were seated promptly.  One of my favorite details was the brass water cups, that little thing made the experience feel authentic!  Some of my friends had never had Indian food before so they had some questions for the waiter and he happily answered them.  There are a lot of choices on the menu, some very authentic dishes.  My Husband and I had a hard time deciding!  We ordered 3 dishes, one was our favorite veggie dish Gobi Alu and we had to try the tikka butter chicken, which we had never come across!  All the portions were excellent, there was enough for my friends to even try some on our choices.  The rice portions could be a bit bigger.  The naan was perfect!  The food was so good, even though I was stuffed I would have kept eating if there was more!  I even tasted my Husbands mango lassi, it was one of the best I had tasted!  The cost of dishes are a couple dollars more than other places I have been, about $15 for a meat dish, but I didn't mind paying more since you got a good portion and it was delicious!

I can not wait to go back to Moti Mahal!  If you are looking for a delicious, authentic Indian meal in a great atmosphere, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I've been dining at Moti Mahal for about 25 years now, and I never tire of the amazing food and stellar service. I was first introduced to Moti by my dad when they were located on 17th Avenue and 4th St, and I dare say they were the best Indian restaurant in the city then as well.

I love the new location off 14th St, and still go there frequently, either to dine in or just pick something up to take home.  Beautiful decor and ambience starts your journey to India, the friendly service and savory spiced dishes steal your heart."}
{"text":"Loved it. Found it on Yelp and decided to try it for dinner before catching a flight home. 

Service was great. I ordered dishes recommended by server - great choice! I had an eggplant dish I wouldn't have normally ordered but it was delicious! I also really liked that they let you order half portions so you can try a couple different items. 

Will definitely go back when I am in town again."}
{"text":"Um...I get that Indian food shouldn't smell good. I get it.
BUT
This place's food smells awful! Stunk up my whole house! Plus, the butter chicken was watered down and the rice was too sticky. Vegetable samosas we're okay though"}
{"text":"Both of the Moti Mahal locations are my favorite indian restaurants in Calgary...bar none!  Their food and service are top notch!  While I find them to be a little on the pricier side for dinner...I will try to come for the lunch buffet as often as possible!  Just as tasty and easier on the pocketbook :)  While I never have trouble finding a parking spot at their midnapore location, finding a spot at their 17th ave location (especially during lunch hour) can be tricky at times.  Apart from that, my experience here has always been amazing!  I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Because I'm not too familiar with Indian cuisine I tend not to venture off the basics (butter chicken and the like). But this place is one of my gf's favourites so I trusted her to take the lead on ordering.

We got tandoori prawns, chicken masala, veggie korma with a side of sesame naan and coconut rice. As with most Asian places, the food was served family style so it worked out great.

Although I tend to think having too many different spices in food can be overwhelming, Indian spices seems to compliment each other so well!  None of the dishes were shy on flavour, I'd have to say my fave dish was the chicken masala - the mixture of curries, tomatoes, onions and peas were perfect.

Would I come back to Moti? Absolutely! Now that I've expanded my pallet a bit more with Indian food, I'm looking forward to trying the other delicious sounding items on the menu."}
{"text":"I stop in to get the lunch buffet some times.  They do a to go buffet which is great!  The Naan is fantastic as well.  It is a good value for how much you can stuff in the box.  You always have left overs.  I would love to dine in one night soon!"}
{"text":"This morning, my little brother moved to India.

To see him off, my sister and I took him out for Indian as a 'this is what you'll be eating for a year' meal.

After reading many reviews about Indian places in the city, and not wanting to travel to the NE since we were sans car, we settled on Moti Mahal; and I think we chose wisely.

The food here is excellent. Between the three of us we had a mango martini, a coconut mohito, a Kingfisher beer, a butter chicken, a vegetables in a delicious cream and fennel curry, a lamb with spinach, saffron rice, naan and chicken simosas; all of which were great. I highly recommend any of the drinks as well as the saffron rice and vegetables * muah * delicious!

The decor is quintessentially Indian (or what I think of as 'quintessentially Indian') complete with tapestries on the walls and bronze dishes.

The service was a little slow at the beginning, but picked up and was attentive throughout. The server even graciously separated our bill at the end of the meal.

Each of us ate and drank for around $40 pp including tip so definitely affordable.

Although I am sure there are Indian places in the NE to write home about, the Moti Mahal still offers a yummy and pretty traditional Indian meal if you want to stick to downtown.

T."}
{"text":"Was visiting Calgary and came here on a friend's recommendation.  The food did not taste fresh; in fact, I could have sworn the vegetables in the veg korma came from a bag of frozen beans and diced carrots.  The curries were also quite watered down.
I dont understand all the positive reviews on here and will definitely not come back."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. I would totally recommend it. Flavourful, but not too spicy at all. The naan is huge."}
{"text":"The food here is exceptional! My wife and I had lunch there an hour back and boy the food was good! I got the malai kofta thali and my wife got the Punjabi daal thali. The food quantity is perfect and the taste is really really good! And Jesse was really helpful with the food selection as well. 
Overall, I'll eat here every time I am in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Lots of good food and great service made this an excellent choice. I've had their brunch another time and it was excellent too.

Having said that, I will admit to being distracted by the company I was with."}
{"text":"Love their mango martini!  Only place that makes them!  They have excellent food.  The butter chicken is the most popular dish.  Parking is a pain.  You may have to park on side streets depending on the day and time.
 It is a great place for large group lunch or dinners!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Spent $80 on takeout and legit couldn't feed 4 people (2 girls, 2 guys who are all average height and weight).

Prawn tikka was actually tiny shrimp. Served with a side of very burnt onion. Jalfrazie was practically sauce less. Vegetables were mostly onions and were not fresh at all. Chicken Tikka Masala was insanely small - only enough for a very very small portion for two people. Naan was all burnt. 

Overpriced. Bad food. Small portions (usually never complain about portions). TERRIBLE SERVICE - guy showed no care when I called in. Don't support this business. I LOVE Indian food but will never go back."}
{"text":"We're regulars here. 
Love their Chicken Korma, of course with Butter Naan and Saffron rice. Consistently good, with a great sauce. 
They have a great selection of Indian food. 
My wife likes the Lamb Bhuna. Tender and flavourful. 
Recommend!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, nice atmosphere. The best food to get is chicken tandori. Considering Calgary's options, one of the bests!"}
{"text":"Great place for Indian food!  No buffet for dinner, but understand they do have a lunch buffet.  Delicious food and attentive waitstaff.  Would definitely come back again.  Butter chicken, spinach paneer, lamb dishes were great.  Didn't have anything bad on the menu and we were a large party who ordered several dishes and shared..."}
{"text":"Every good Asian knows that value is an important component of your daily diet. Unfortunately, that is a key ingredient (alongside perhaps some more spice) that Moti Mahal is missing. 

I had the veggie samosas ($5 for 2), and the eggplant bartha ($13). The food quality was pretty good - the samosas were decent, and the eggplant tasted fairly fresh with a nice blend of flavours, but definitely could have used more of a kick. However, at $13, the quantity of eggplant was shamefully disappointing (not enough to fill your standard 500g cottage cheese container), and not justified by the nothing-spectacular quality.

Overall, decent food, but rather indecent price vs portions ratio. Might come back for the lunchtime buffet.

--
EDIT: returned for lunch buffet, only to find that THERE IS NO LUNCH BUFFET. There's a lunch special instead now, which includes a small dish with a bit of naan and rice, some veggies, a bit of salad, and a few pieces of fruit; prices range from $12 to $14 for the set. It's a bit better value, but still nothing to write home about. On to the next one!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for dinner. Food was good. However, it wasnt authentic Indian food. Was modified to cater to Canadian customers. It needed some spice and good flavours."}
{"text":"Just up 17th avenue on the corner with 14th street SW is Moti Mahal, the best Indian cuisine in Calgary. Period. I've tried numerous places over the years; Namskar, Nirvana, Puspa, Glory of India... and Moti takes the cake every time. None of the other places I've tried have even held a flame to Moti. And this is one of those battles I am constantly having with my friends. They think their place is the best, but I KNOW my place is the best. I'll reluctantly try their choice, and listen to them gush over the samosas and the paneer. And each time, I tell them, \"this was OK. But Moti is so much better.\" I've become a complete snob about it, actually refusing to eat at a place that serves Indian that I've already tried that isn't Moti. I will still try new places... but I'm starting to wonder if I should even bother doing that.

The interior of the restaurant is decorated really well. It's a pleasure to look around at the colorful wall hangings and the large bench seat at the entrance. Water is served in handle-less, copper cups, and cutlery is not mandatory. In fact, I recommend you ditch the fork and use your delicious garlic naan bread to go to town on your dinner, mixing all the different dishes into mounds of long-grain rice. 

My top menu choices? As for tandoori specialties, go for the Moti Special Plate. An amazing and flavorful mix of meats and vegetables. A definite crowd-pleaser. For chicken dishes, the Chicken Mumtaz is great. A slow heat with sweet dried apricots in a smooth sauce with tender chicken pieces. Vegetable dish; the Eggplant Bartha. It's a smooth puree of some of the most delicious stuff you've ever tried. I can't even describe the flavor, it's that good. The Zucchini Tukra is also amazing. An absolute must-try for lamb lovers? The Lamb Bhoona. Definitely spicy, so beware if that's not your cup of tea. But it's out of this world. The Vindaloo, while delicious, is not for the faint of heart when it comes to heat. When they say it's spicy, they really mean it. If you're into that, get the lamb vindaloo. If you can't dine-in, take out is just as good. 

If you haven't tried Moti Mahal yet, ditch your old go-to Indian place and graduate into some real food. Forget what you thought was good. The best is here."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last night.  I am a regular at Mango Shiva and wanted to try something different.  Overall, while their prices might be slightly lower, I found that the food was not comparable to Mango Shiva.  The Samosa were over stuffed and doughy, the butter chicken was too bland and creamy.  I did enjoy the eggplant dish.  Their nan was good.

Service was good."}
{"text":"East Indian Food done right! Love the remodel, love the food, the service, and the felling that I am \"at home\" when I'm here! Samosas are the best in town!"}
{"text":"really good Indian food, great service as well.  We live in Florida, otherwise we'd be frequent customers."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this restaurant. First of all, the service was really poor. Second, some of the food I had tasted stale and was somewhat bland, which is not what you'd expect from an Indian restaurant of all places.  Would not come back here."}
{"text":"First time coming to this restaurant and I was definitely bowled over. Restaurant is super clean, the food was amazing and the staff fast and friendly.  I recommend trying the Lamb Vindaloo and butter chicken.  Meal is not complete without some garlic naan."}
{"text":"YUMMY!  We ended our honeymoon in Calgary, and we were craving indian food.  Some locals suggested we head to Moti Mahal, and I wish I could write them a thank you note.  We were so impressed with how good the food and service was.  The wait staff was so pleasant and accomodating.  The food was outstanding and the dishes were the perfect portion sizes.  We had the chicken tikka masala, an eggplant dish that was to die for, a spicy lamb dish that was just perfect, som lentils, and garlic naan.  I could not tell you which dish I enjoyed most.  We really enjoyed our dinner there!  We hope that we have to return to Calgary so we can come again..."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed after reading all the rave reviews and getting a local reference for this place. I'm on the road and have only eaten here once, but for the quality and price I wouldn't go back. I got the vegetable korma; the sauce lacked depth, the vegetables seemed almost as if they came from a can and the paneer was off in a way I can't quite put my finger on. For $22.05 + tip I got papdams, vegetable korma, naan and a mango lassi. The lassi was really the best part of the meal. The bread wasn't bad. The korma was uninspiring. I didn't even get rice because it was extra. I thought it odd when they didn't ask me how spicy I wanted my dish when I ordered - a suspicious omission confirmed by the lack of dimension to the dish's spice. Still, the meal satisfied my Indian food craving and the service was good."}
{"text":"Mmmm. So tasty. One of the best in Calgary for sure."}
{"text":"The indian food is excellent.  Great spices, they can make it as hot as you want, and the garlic naan is crispy-doughy perfection.

The only reason I'm giving it 5 stars is because the lamb was a little tough.  I like my lamb so tender it just falls apart, which is definitely not the case at Moti."}
{"text":"Awesome lamb rogangosh and lamb biryani. The roti plate was alright. Great environment also, plays sad songs from Indian movies most of the time. Great Indian beer and copper ware to drink and eat off of."}
{"text":"Well I dont often go to Indian restaurants - but as a vegetarian I likely should - so many delicious options. There is something about good Indian restaurants that is elegant yet comforting - familiar yet exotic. Moti Mahal has all of these traits. Walking in, the warmth of the restaurant is evident - earthy colour palette with pops of vibrant purples and red. Friendly greeting upon entering- the glow of candles and the aromatic scents of delicious Indian cuisine. It was my birthday dinner with my lovely family and we had a great meal. 
We started with Pakoras- deep fried and crispy - so flavorful. Served with a selection of 3 dipping sauces - a chutney, a tamarind sauce and some kind of mint sauce. Although the selection was nice I would have preferred more of just one. 
We followed it up with 2 Veggie dishes for me - The kofta - delicious cheese bundles as well as the Jalfriese ( spelling?) a spicy vegetable stewy dish and my sis and bro in law had some butter chicken. This was served with Saffron rice and delicious naan. 
Our server was lovely, unpretentious and sweet. 
The only negative of the night was the fact that it seemed like it took awhile for our food to come out, that said - it was delicious when it arrived. 
We all noticed that people tended to hang around a long time - reluctant to leave- the tables on either side stayed quite awhile. The restaurant was conducive to that, a lovely retreat from outside - tummies full of delicious food - warm atmosphere and kind gracious service.  I will definitely return - or at the very least order some take out soon. Dont miss this place -especially if you are a vegetarian!"}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent and attentive service.
Parking was easy.  Clean and great ambience
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I would come more often, but I find the food pretty pricey. One dish I love is the eggplant. It just has this incredible taste to it -even my boyfriend who hates eggplant loves it. I think the eggplant dish is even better than butter chicken, chicken korma and paneer. Value wise it's better to eat in than take-out. The portions are even smaller for takeout. You pretty much get about a cup and half (375 ml) if you get the entrees to go. But for a date night, the restaurant is pretty romantic and the service is stellar. Plus they make a lovely mango lassi vodka cocktail."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for such a long time as it has always had great reviews.  So I had really high expectations that were only partly met.
The shrimp salen was the tastiest dish although the cauliflower alu was also very nice.  Butter chicken was only average.  The nannn was fresh and the garlic and butter added a nice flavour to it.  Mango lasses were thinner and less yogurty than what I have been use too but were still ok they way they served it.
The atmosphere was less authentic than I had expected. It felt very westernized and somewhat mainstream despite the use of copper and metal traditional dishes.  Seemed to attract less of an ethnic crowd but maybe that's just due to location.
Overall was a good experience.  Servers were nice and efficient also."}
{"text":"Oh my, the feasts I have had all thanks to Moti Mahal. It doesn't take a genius to figure it out, this place simply makes delicious, mouthwatering food for a sect price. 

The inside is warm, elegant and lives up to the Indian theme of the restaurant. The service has always been good and when you don't want to sit down and eat, they welcome takeout customers. 

If you like Indian food, this should be a stop for you. Even if you don't like Indian food, this place may change your mind."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout February 2017. Terrible food, the butter chicken, Goa curry, and vegetable jalfrazie tasted old. They must be taken from the freezer and reheated. Honestly disgusting. The veggies were mushie. 
If you want good Indian food try nawab !"}
{"text":"This was our first time we went to this restaurant. I am extremely frustrated with the food that they served. The taste was horrible as their food was smelly. They do not know the difference between biryani and fried rice. I can still smell that stink of food in my mouth and hand after few hours. 

I would not recommend anyone to go to this restaurant as its waste of money. The worse think is when we recommend to have better quality food, they are not getting agreed.

When we recommend to improve the food, they mentioned that this is how they have been serving over 25 yrs and will continue in future. I seriously wonder how they survive this restaurant."}
{"text":"I dont understand the hype for this place. If you've ever explored the Falconridge area you would know you are paying way to much for low quality Indian food at Moti Mahal.

{"text":"Yo, this place. THIS PLACE. 

I come here multiple times whenever I visit Calgary... I'd estimate I've come 10-12 times? The vegetarian options here are consistently incredible. Like, I literally have dreams about the matter paneer. Other dishes I have tried and loved include malai kofta, nauratan (tastes very similar to the matter paneer), mumbai alu, vegetable korma, eggplant bartha, punjabi dhal, and dhal maharani. I also get the mango lassi every time, tried lychee juice last night and it was great as well. I CANNOT EXPRESS IN WORDS HOW MUCH I LOVE THE FOOD HERE. I could eat it every day and be perfectly happy. 

The location itself is spacious, nice decor, kind of dark--a good place for date night. It's never too crowded--I usually call an hour before to make a reservation and never have to wait. Service is usually quite fast. The boy thinks meat dishes aren't quite as good as the vegetarian options (I wouldn't know), but LET ME JUST SAY THAT YOU SHOULD GO FOR THE VEGETARIAN OPTIONS ALONE. 

In conclusion: I seriously wish I could get their food shipped to me or something, it's that amazing. I eat a lot of Indian food, and this is definitely by far my favorite place. Prices are quite reasonable. Bring your date here. Definitely order the matter paneer."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a fantastic place for Indian food, you've found it.  This little place has the most amazing food.  Read the other reviews and you will see a recurring theme.  

I went to Moti Mahal based on the recommendations on Yelp, and what a gem.  They had the usual staple type Indian items on the menu.  Like, butter chicken, tandori, naan, etc.  We had ordered these, However, our server recommended a couple of other items.  One was an Eggplant dish.  I have to say up front, I'm not an eggplant lover, in fact I usually try to avoid it.  This was the BEST dish on the table.  Our server had a spinach dish recommendation, again, I thought it was better than the butter chicken.  And because I love butter chicken, this means the dish was outstanding. 

Service was prompt, friendly, and very attentive. Also the suggestions from the server was much appreciated and were winners !  Top marks for service.  

The only downside I'll give to Moti Mahal, is the portion size.  Dishes were a bit small.  There were two of us, and we ordered 4 dishes, including Naan and rice, Figuring there would be leftovers to take, there was nothing left.  If you are doing family style, 1 dish may server 3 maybe 4 and that's it.  But I won't knock them on quantity, especially when the quality was so fantastic. 

Thank you yelpers for rating this place.  I found a new favorite Indian place in Calgary, even though I don't live in the city."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most spacious Indian restaurants out in Calgary, Moti Mahal would score high on everything - food, ambience, service. A little swing just at the entrance makes the feeling very royal. There's a set of wine corks stored outside that brings a smile to your face and invite you to try out the fine wines. What I also liked was the dedicated parking space that they had. We ate quite a lot - Pakoras, Chat, Biryani, Butter Chicken. Everything was very tasty. I had ordered mild food but one of the servings was spicy - the staff immediately said that they would replace it. I liked the gesture although I continued eating the spicy stuff. I have no hesitations in giving these folks a 5 star!"}
{"text":"Food was good so as the ambiance. We thought that a price tag was a bit high but not a deal breaker. Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered the Lamb Dhansak (boneless lamb, yellow lentils, tamarind and mustard seed curry) from their lunch menu. This $14 platter included cubes of watermelon, a small iceberg lettuce salad, marinated vegetables, basmati rice, and a few wedges of garlic naan. Everything was delicious, and service was attentive without being overbearing. Their mango lassi was just the right balance of sweet and tart."}
{"text":"Loved the paneer food. Lovely location, and great service! The aloo tikki appetizer was a little confusing because it had a lot of onions. But try the mango lassi... It's delicious! Overall... Thoroughly enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Not a very personalize service from the server, although the owner Lady seems nice. Ordered Lamb Korma and it was rubber like balls. Dal to die for and great roti"}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this place yet since I eat here often. This in my opinion is the best Indian cuisine in the city. We've tried many others and none compare. It's got so much flavour and the portions are decent for what you pay. They have very friendly staff and the place has an authentic look and vibe. 

The samosas are really good, but that being said it seems they've downsized them since the last time we came. They offer a nice trio of sauces from mint to spicy to go along with. 

The Chili fish is an absolute must. I'm kind of a spice wuss but we order it every time it's that good. There are so many choices for chicken, lamb and seafood dishes as well as vegetable. They have spice levels to meet everyone's taste. The naan bread is awesome as well. I highly recommend this place if you like Indian food. 

If I had to gripe about anything it would be the parking. They don't have enough to meet their seating capacity and sometimes when we come the lot is full and we have to wait or choose to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, I tried Moti Mahal for the first time a few weeks ago. I love indian food, but I had no idea where was good in Calgary (even after asking friends from India!). Im SO glad we decided to go here!! I did not make reservations, and it was pretty busy when we arrived. We waited about 15 minutes as we were hoping for a table further away from the door (it was cold outside), but finally our stomachs were yelling at us to just pick a damn table. So we sat right near the bar, which ended up being nice because we were the only ones in that section. I got the coconut mojito right away based on the rave reviews and it was absolutely amazing, my boyfriend was really jealous after he tasted it. We ordered the tandoori prawns and samosas to start, they were really good. For our mains we had butter chicken, korma, rice, and naan bread. I was hesitant about ordering the butter chicken because I've had it a million times, but my boyfriend insisted and I was so happy he did!!! It was THE BEST butter chicken I have ever tasted! Everything was SO fresh, hot, and tasty. We ate, drank wine, and enjoyed the ambiance, never feeling rushed by the servers. Despite being stuffed, we also went for the dessert sampler as well which was the perfect ending to the meal...just a taste and each item was interesting. The staff was attentive but not overbearing and even chatted with us and made us laugh a few times! I absolutely loved my experience here and I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Moti Mahal is the best all-around Indian restaurant in Calgary.  While it hits all the notes as most traditional Indian restaurants in terms of decor and menu, Moti dials down the oil/grease quotient, making dining there better than the rest.  Here's an Indian restaurant you can actually leave feeling satisfied instead of full of regret!

They have an expansive menu, excellent flavour profile, and appropriate portions.  The atmosphere is intimate and more suited to adults/couples or small groups than big parties or families with (loud) kids.  

The super spicy, super good chicken mumtaz featuring curry with apricots is my favourite!"}
{"text":"We quite enjoy this place.  Their fish dishes are all quite tasty, and their naan is delicious (it's terrible at a lot of places).  Their appetizers (samosas, pakoras, etc.) are also well done.  In general, their sauces are pretty flavorful.

I think their lassis have too much ground ice in them, but my wife likes them.

My four star review has an asterisk beside it, though.  The last two times we've ordered chicken dishes (tandoori chicken and shahi jeera chicken) they've been badly overdone, to the point where we didn't finish the shahi jeera chicken or bother taking it home.

Still, it's our current go-to Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Every time I end up in Calgary I eat here. Every. Time.
I consider indian food my favourite food and this place never once let me down.

The veg items were always satisfying, the service has always been exceptional and the atmosphere is always nice and relaxed. I'm also a big fan of the fact that there is a parking lot on site. Easy.

Nothing but love for this place."}
{"text":"Except for, want to know what is awkward? CLOSING YOUR AMAZING RESTAURANT, ON 17TH AVENUE, ON THE WEEKENDS! Sorry Moti Mahal, but I am bummed out."}
{"text":"Excellent food and amazing service. We got the lamb masala and the butter chicken and both were good. The lamb masala was spicier than expected but very flavourful. The naan bread was slightly crispy, buttery and delicious. The servers were VERY attentive and we had 3 people check in on us multiple times. The food also came put quickly. Overall, no complaints."}

Food: 3.5/5
Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5

Came here cold and hungry for a late night dinner. Not the best Indian food I've had but it was good. Portions were standard but the pricing is more on the higher end/finer dining. We ordered the butter chicken, fish biryani, paneer and the chili korma with a side of roti and plain basmati rice. Flavours seemed standard, nothing that really stood out for me unfortunately... It hit the spot for the craving and warmed us up but I don't think I would recommend or come back here. 

Shout-out to the nice menu design and the friendly service!"}
{"text":"Good service. Decent food. Decent servings. Alright prices. Location sucks for parking,  but it really hasn't changed much in there in terms of quality."}
{"text":"Love this local spot! The food is super uber delicious, service is spot on, warm, friendly & totally reasonably priced! If you want authentic traditional Northern Indian food come here there's nowhere else to go! It's so tasty and delicious I couldn't believe it! I live in Brooklyn, New York and every time I come to Calgary I always make a point of stopping by this little Indian GEM ?"}
{"text":"Review #18 for Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012

I went here for dinner on Friday with my boyfriend as our first Indian restaurant experience in Calgary together. (We love Indian and had previously had a bunch in Vancouver)

I was very adamant about finding an amazing place to go to. I didn't want to chance it. 

So I decided on here after looking at the menu, they do Kashmiri style Indian so it is slightly different than the typical fare you might find. They also had a lot of veganizable vegetable curries to choose from as everything was not based on paneer or cream so I was happy. 

The waitress, although a white girl and no Indian servers to be found, was super friendly, helpful and actually aware of ingredients in menu items. All I had to say was these dishes vegan and she was like no problem. (This sometimes can be an issue as people may not know butter isn't vegan because it is made from dairy which is praised in India.) 

We ordered the Palak (Spinach) Dal $11.50, Eggplant Bharta $13.50, Mumbai Aloo (Potato Curry) $12.50, Saffron Rice $5 and Roti $1.85 each.  So overall very affordable for a lot of food for 2 people. 

I always get Eggplant Bharta it's a curry made from creamy roasted eggplant and tempered with spices, great for dipping.  And the Palak Dal and the Mumbai Aloo were new. The Palak Dal was good, no complaints, I might try a regular dal next time. The Mumbai Aloo was great! It had a tomato tamarind sauce that was the die for. Way different than the traditional tomato based curry, so delicious and I wanted to put that sauce on everything.  I'll definitely be looking up the recipe. 

The only thing was all the dishes came out mild when I asked for the Mumbai Aloo to be medium spicy for my BF cuz he loves spice. But it was still good anyway. 

We made reservations in advance, which was helpful so there was no wait. 

Other observations were that it is quite chilly sitting by the window which half of the restaurant does, our feet were freezing the whole time. (Maybe you're supposed to order spicy food to stay warm? Ha!) and some couples brought their BABIES on a Friday night out for dinner... which was a little uncool as they were crying the whole time. 

But the delicious food and the great waitress made it an excellent meal out and we'll definitely be back to try more of the vegan friendly fare. 

For meat eaters they have a ton of chicken, lamb and seafood dishes as well that are around $15-$16 each."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place!!!... everything was very tasty and well prepared!!.. the mango and the tamarindo chutneys are delicious!,.. the cocktails are just great!!... Awesome mojitos!!..."}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian food. They have the best rice in Calgary no matter what kind you get, the eggplant bartha is my favourite dish there because it's spicy but also so flavourful. Not to mention, the lassi's are so good no matter what kind you choose to get. I personally love the mango lassi! Great service and ambience as well."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and decor. The food was ok for the price though I have heard it used to be much better in the past."}
{"text":"Standard menu but well done. An old standby of ours, and continues to produce good quality stuff. Sometimes a wee bit hard to get parked."}
{"text":"I gave the four star rating because it is exceptionally pricey for what you get. The food is terrific and they have a great variety but takeout items are served in little salad dishes and cost about 10% more than other Indian food establishments in the SW plus you get about half the amount."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the food here and they are VERY accomodating to allergens/gluten free. Big bonus."}
{"text":"I lived in Calgary for a number of months, and this is actually the first Indian restaurant I have ever eaten at. It's a beautifully decorated restaurant that is very traditional in decor, so you feel like you might be in India. I loved the copper cups they used for serving water. 

I was here with a friend. We got vegetable samosas to start, then we had butter chicken, saffron rice, and naan bread. Everything was absolutely delicious. The chicken was a little too spicy for me though.

Ever since I ate here, I've been hooked on Indian food. I've been to many Indian restaurants in Edmonton, and none of them match or exceed the wonderfully authentic atmosphere of Moti Mahal."}
