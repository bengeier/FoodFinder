{"text":"I liked biryani here however quantity and quality is reducing day by day in sithara uptown and also there is no home delivery option in uptown branch"}
{"text":"As someone who eats Indian food often, I can say that the lunch buffet was one of the worst I've ever gone too. I went to the lunch buffet on a Saturday And while the service and the naan were great, the Briyani was dry and looked like it was made a couple days ago and reheated. As well as the fact that the number of items on the buffet is limited and I couldn't bear to put some of the food in my mouth."}
{"text":"This is by far best place to get authentic south  Indian food. Love all dishes I eat here"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! I recently moved here from NY and have been on the quest for a good lunch spot. This place is hands down the best Indian food I've had for lunch!! I got the chicken biryani and tiki masala (I know, I'm basic) and it was absolutely fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Dosas were crisp and fresh. Indo Chinese took me back to my Indian street food days. Must try in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian Restaurant in the University area. I now go every week for the weekend buffet and it has never disappointed. The only negative is the space they chose, as other restaurants have more room and better ambience. However, the quality of the food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"Totally delicious. Stopped here on a road trip and will make it a fave from now on.  Ask how the Gobi 65 got its name and then order some! Had the okra and veg curry. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great Indian & authentic food. The staff is genuinely friendly throughout. Good menu choices for all the meals. Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Recommended by a teammate because she knows I love South Indian food.  Trying the vuffet on my day off.  Parking is great..and easy to get to from highway.  restaurant is quiet because it is 30 mins before lunch buffet closing.  Nice greeting by hostess.  Buffet is very small....but restaurant is open just 2 days.  Trying everything on buffet.   Flavors are great."}
{"text":"Excellent cooked from scratch chicken vindaloo!! We love Indian food and this was the best we've had since we moved here in August. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Chicken tikka masala was way too sweet. I actually got a headache and couldn't finish my food. Had to go somewhere else to eat dinner."}
{"text":"We have visited this restaurant many times. We love the non veg menu. We started with chicken chittinad on our first visit and loved it. They made it so good with regional taste and smell. Apart from chettinad they have very good goat curry. It's spicy but tasty. I specially like fish pulusu. It's so different from what I had tried before with fish. Sambar is good most times but average a few times. Channa masala is good in veg menu.  Ok ambience. Basic setup. Good service. Good authentic regional taste I would say. Recommended for South Indian dishes."}
{"text":"Best taste especially if you like spicy food. Goat biryani is the best ever. Even the vegetarian dishes are very tasty!!"}
{"text":"Quaint, intimate Indian restaurant located where Casablanca Caf√© was (the Moroccan place with hardly any patrons).  I'm not well schooled in Indian cuisine but I liked the lunch buffet. Solid offerings with good spice (not just heat).  My butter chicken was, well, buttery and scrumptous.  Mmmm.  The hostess could not have been more helpful, accompanying me along the buffet answering questions, while pointing out the Scoville scale landmines.  Thanks!  I think Sithara has a winner in the works.  I say, \"Give 'em a whirl!\""}
{"text":"By far the best South Indian food that we had in Charlotte. Manager Mr Kris was extremely warm. Kids enjoyed butter chicken and haleem. Don't forget to ask for chef special Falooda."}
{"text":"When I want to go out for lunch or dinner, I always prefer for sithara . Because taste and aroma of the food is so great,and the service is wonderful . I recommend each and everyone to visit sithara."}
{"text":"3-4 stars with a major gripe.  We went here for the second time this weekend, and love their food, spicy and abundant. We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, and a curry goat masala dish and always garlic naan bread, which is the absolute best.  However, I cannot, for the life of me, understand why (on both occasions) I got served my food first and was almost finished before my boyfriend got his order.  On both occasions, I would try to wait until my boyfriend got his plate but he insisted I start without him, which I did, but I was literally almost done before he got his plate. We always order the garlic naan bread which melts in your mouth, BUT, that didn't come either until AFTER my boyfriend eventually got his plate.  The purpose of the bread is to balance out the spicy food, so to get it well after the food is served is like, why bother?  We can't understand why they think this is ok (two different times)...it is NOT! Don't bring one plate out until BOTH are done and ready to be served. Bring the bread out WITH the meal, NOT when everyone is almost done.  We really like that their food is spicy and tasty, but I am ready to go back to our old favorite, Passage to India on University Blvd (where everything is good and comes out at the same time)  but my boyfriend is more forgiving and would come back here again.  Other than that...which is a big deal for me, the food is really good."}
{"text":"Very bad service . I have had food here multiple times and have found the same service every time . The price tags are high but the service and the way the food is packaged is very bad (it's a to go place )  Example if you order a biryani you will not get any sides with it .... and taste is also going down everyday ."}
{"text":"I've been only to the lunch buffet at Sithara, but it sure is a good one.  I live in a town that's got its fair share of Indian restaurants, but it doesn't have a very strong variety of them:  the vast majority, some of which are good, feature what's become the largely ghee-heavy Northern Indian standards you see in the U.S. (tandoori chicken, lots of butter chicken offerings, naan, samosas, saag paneer, etc.).  What's not nearly as common in most towns in this country is Southern Indian-focused menus.  (This one, unlike many Southern Indian restaurants, is not vegetarian.)  This one's got a heavy emphasis on biryanis.  Plus, you get as bread the thinner, more crepe-like pulka instead of naan.  Anyway, I have a regrettable lack of experience with good biryanis--only recently have I come to realize how much explosive flavor a good cook/chef can pack into a single grain of rice--and I suspect they're always better when freshly prepared.  But the goat biryani on the lunch buffet was still delicious.   Can't remember all that much else about the buffet selections other than that, compared to the average Northern Indian buffet, you get less earthy and buttery and more floral and fragrant flavors.  And that I came away with a very good impression.  P.S. Looks like the dinner menu has a mish-mash of Northern & Southern specialties.  (Of course, I should acknowledge that \"Northern\" & \"Southern\" are hardly very descriptive when talking about a country as large and diverse as India.)"}
{"text":"This is the absolute best Indian restaurant in the university area! The lunch buffet is excellent! While I'd like to try other things on the dinner menu, I cannot find the will to pass on the chicken vindaloo. The medium chicken vindaloo is a perfect mix of flavor and spice. If you love Indian food like I do this is a must visit!"}
{"text":"Beware that PRICES are NOT ACCURATE!   I ordered a two non-vegetable combo that was advertised as 8.99 on their menu. Instead, they charged me 9.99, and when I addressed this to the cashier, he said they recently changed prices. If that's the case, please only charge the prices that are reflected on your menu! While it's only a dollar, this still really irritates me (I'm sure I'm not the only one with this experience during lunch rush).   I've noticed they've constantly changed their service since I first ate here last year. Before you could get a drink with your food. Not anymore! Two stars because the food is still ok. Call it petty, but I will not eat here again (I only eat here every other month). I recommend going to one of the halal food carts or Nirvana II instead of this place."}
{"text":"Typical Indian restaurant. Nice friendly atmosphere. But we went late, and some of the food was gone and they stopped filling it. Whatever was there was good though."}
{"text":"We found our go to Indian Restaurant. Their Gobi 65 was delicious. Their buttered chicken was hands down the best I have ever had. Warning: mild is still pretty darn spicy. Still amazing though. My hubby had the spinach paneer doma, which was not what we had expected but amazing nonetheless. It came out bigger than my forearm and we filled it our selves which was nice as the spicy stuff stayed on his portion."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful!!  The staff was friendly and attentive . I was pleased with everything I ordered. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Good setup . One day I went with my friends and had a good time there . Food was good . And they even had Haleem which I liked it if they had more fried onions with some lemons I would love that more.  Buffet is good and reasonable price.  My only concern is they don't have Naan when I asked the manager he said they don't have tandoor machine . But I love there Chappatis which is truly home made Indian style."}
{"text":"Indian food in charlotte has gone from bad to worse over the recent months. It was high time, I found another restaurant than my usuals to satisfy my Indian taste buds. Having said that, sithara restaurant has been around for some time as I have been to this restaurant at-least an year back, but it wasn't good enough that could make me want to return. Anyways back to the very recent visit, the  restaurant is located in a busy complex up north tryon. Combined with a lot of restaurants, the complex has a lot of other hang options and enough parking spaces. The interiors is not a very big space and not very fancy but decent enough, serves South Indian style food and offers Indian beers as well. The staff Was welcoming and we were given a table right away. We ordered Medhu vada(an Indian snack) and it came with sides of sambhar and two chutneys. This was the average start. The Vada needed a lot of improvement and so did the sides. Next we Ordered the Chettinadu chicken curry, (breads) Naans and romali rotis. The curry quantity is sufficient for two and tastes great. We had ordered it to be medium spicy but this itself was too spicy for us to handle. Make sure you order the right spice levels. Chettinadu curries are known for the spices and the flavors it brings, Loved the curry and would return for this alone. The Breads were fresh and exceptional in taste.  At the end we ordered the desert(carrot halwa) and it was awesome. The restaurant hosting hyderabadi style also had haleems and biriyani on its menu. So overall a very satisfactory visit. We will be definitely return and will recommend others to visit."}
{"text":"Love their food!!!! I especially like chicken65 and biryani.Favorite take out restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte. They have a great lunch buffet with lots to mix and match. The spice level is perfect and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best biriyani in charlotte!!  I never had this kind of biriyani in any part of US...Absolutely loving it   I am having biriyani 3 days a week. Quality is getting reduced day by day.. Chicken is reduced in biriyani.."}
{"text":"My new favorite Indian restaurant!! The portions here are not only large but they are delicious!! I had the chicken tika masala and gobi 65 and they both were amazing. Highly recommend this place to anybody looking for the best Indian food in Charlotte. We also met the owner and told him the food was delicious!! He was really friendly."}
{"text":"It was rather disappointed experience. I went to lunch buffet on Saturday. The food selections are limited. Lack in depth flavor. My wife gotten sick after the meal, and I wonder if the ingredients has anything to do with it. For two dollars more, you could gone to Blue Taj for better ambiance and better quality and generous amount of  food. Service is good, and offer plain dosa. However, it does not overcome taste and lack of generosity of food. Only a Few pieces of lamb or chicken in the entire pot of biryani, dish are too watery to find actual veggie or meat. For the price of 11.99, I would stay with passage of India."}
{"text":"Very ill managwd resturant.no sufficient staffs and waiter doesnt know about the menu"}
{"text":"I can't give negative stars, so 1 it is. Will never order there again. My order was for a grobhub delivery. Butter chicken with rice, Naan, 2 mango lassie. I got butter chicken, Naan and 1 mango lassie. Called the restaurant and the owner said that he forgot to put rice and second mango lassie in. And told me to request a refund. How do you request a refund for something that was supposed to be a part of a dish, not separate item? Short story long, I waited for an hour to get food delivered, and then another 30 min to make rice and reheat butter chicken. If you ever reheated butter chicken, you know that it's pretty much ruined at that point."}
{"text":"Popped in based on yelpers & wasn't disappointed. I went with 2 friends & we shared chili shrimp appetizer (amazing-the spice was perfect) and we each got curry goat, chicken tikka masala & curry vegetables. Lots of vegetarian options and server was efficient. Portion sizes are generous and we left with leftovers. Do yourself a favor and stop by. (Here's a pic of my friends curry goat plate) as you can see, it was good. She said the goat was tender & flavorful)."}
{"text":"So on a regular Wednesday, Me and my mom decided to try this new place out that we saw on Yelp, and citing that their lunch buffet for non-veg was $6.99....we thought why not ?   We dropped by at around 1:45 PM....Their lunch buffet closes at 2:30 PM....to me we still had adequate time to enjoy the buffet.   This is what we experience before we even ate...just by walking in, we saw that there was NO one there, it was REALLY hot (80+ inside while its 90 outside) Fans running at full speed...just throwing more hot air around the restaurant....  So we contemplated if we should stay or not...we said well, lets try this out regardless....  When we got to the food...it was COLD. I would honestly say that the room was actually ALOT hotter than the food. I asked the server/waiter why it was so cold and not hot ? His response was \"it has been a slow day\" I didn't know that due to being slow that the food would be cold ?  Besides that fact, There were some items missing from the buffet or in low quantities...this included the rotis and white basmati rice...both which they brought from the back for us which was fine.   Food tasted really good, except it was almost ice cold. When we went to pay for the meal...we got charged $9.99 and not the $6.99...I asked the person why ? The printout they have is actually very misleading...the person at the register had this \"we got ya !\" smirk on his face the whole time, and it was not appreciated.   I would like to go back again sometime, but this experience wasnt that great. It was SUPER hot, the food was COLD and we got mislead by their ad/print."}
{"text":"Located in Latta Arcade, Sithara is a takeout only counter serving rotating Indian dishes for the lunch crowd. You choose your rice and 1-3 sides. I had rice with chicken tikka Masala and dal makhani. The food was just ok, if a bit on the sweeter side and heavy. It's a decent option though if you're looking for a lot of food quickly."}
{"text":"I have been to a ton of Indian restaurants in Charlotte and the surrounding areas. Sithara is my absolute favorite now. Finally, a place who isn't afraid to put spice in their food and makes everything flavorful. The biryani is the best I have ever had! There wasn't a single thing I didn't like on the buffet. They even had butter milk available.    Friday - Sunday more items are featured on the buffet. If you want to get a taste of everything available then be sure to visit Fri-Sun."}
