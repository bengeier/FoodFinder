{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh.  Everything thing is perfectly spiced and cooked very good.  And the spice level (1-10) is actually pretty accurate unlike some of the other very popular noodle shops.  Very friendly staff and small intimate interior.  Also BYOB."}
{"text":"This was terrible. I ordered my food with a spice level of 5 and it ended up almost inedibly spicy. The spice profile didn't even make sense -- crushed red pepper (like the kind you put on pizza) all over my salad (???), which was also drowning in peanut sauce. I have never received a salad with peanut sauce over it from a take out Thai place -- who doesn't put it on the side?? Incredibly angry. Never ordering from here again, and you shouldn't either."}
{"text":"Never again! Larb kai(chicken salad) smelled really weird and was way too sweet. It actually had no other flavors even i ordered spicy10. Fresh rolls were too expensive for what you paid for (no meat) and taste extremely bad. Spicy basil sauce dish was ok but still not impressed. Very disappointed. Never again."}
{"text":"This restaurant had great food for reasonable prices and is just a small walk from Children's Hospital. We would definitely return next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from this place blindly and I was pleasantly surprised. I'm always trying to find a good Thai restaurant and one that makes good pad Thai. This is a decent place! Solid pad Thai with a really large portion. I also ordered the Tom Kha soup because it's my favorite and I always want to find places that make it well. This soup was great! I hate mushrooms and although they're almost whole in this version, I loved it anyway! The spice level is pretty hot, though. I got a 3 out of 10 (from what my ordering app asked me) and 3 is a bit spicy! Still good, though. I wish they put some lime in the pad Thai, though, I just prefer it."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here twice--- the pad Thai noodles with tofu and pad cashew noodles with tofu. I was expecting more from the spice level ( ordered a 10 on both) but they were both flavorful and the portions were huge. Definitely one of the better thai places that I have tried"}
{"text":"Really excellent Thai food that will keep me coming back. They serve those delicious Thai Samosa that used to be on the menu at Smiling Banana Leaf. 

I was inspired to try a dish new to me, so I ordered the Tom Kha Soup.

Our server was friendly and funny and welcoming. She was helpful in every way.

For dessert we tried the Thai Custard with Sweet Rice. It was the perfect way to end a delightful dinner."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here and was not blown away. I ordered the chicken fried rice and found it to be quite bland. My coworker ordered his sweet & sour chicken with a spice level of 8 and he said it was more like a 2 or 3. It was not terrible, but I wouldn't go out of my way to order from here again, especially considering the price.

My biggest gripe is that the food prices are higher on Grubhub than on your actual website! Each entree was about $3-4 more expensive..."}
{"text":"I ordered dinner as delivery. 
Crab rangoon - 3 stars - contained a bit too much cheese and grease. 
Green curry chicken - 3 stars - was too watery but tasted good.
Yellow curry chicken - 3 stars - was also too watery but tasted good.
Jasmine rice - 5 stars - was a generous amount for the price.
Fried pot stickers - 2 stars - had dough that was way too thick. 
Pad see ew with shrimp - 2 stars - had overcooked shrimp and too many carrots and eggs."}
{"text":"Ordered through Grub Hub while I was at work. I got the chicken pad thai and a coworker got a thai iced coffee on my recommendation. The chicken pad thai was bland. Barely any sauce and the chicken looked weird. I didn't each very much of it before it went into the trash. My coworker took one sip of the iced coffee and said it was disgusting. I LOVE thai iced coffee and tea so when I tried it, I knew something was wrong. It had a weird chicken or meat taste to it. They must have kept the iced coffee in the fridge with their meat because it was not good AT ALL. The whole drink went into the trash. I would not order from them again."}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEats. Had Thai Somosa and  Pad Thai.  The somosas you get 5 with sweet and sour sauce - very good. Pad Thai was a solid choice. My only complaint was I ordered a spice level of 8 on a 1-10 scale and there was no spice at all."}
{"text":"This new Thai restaurant is about one month old and located directly across from Children's Hospital. I went to check in on Yelp but learned they weren't on Yelp yet. First take-out tried pineapple fried rice with chicken spice level 4 and the crab rangoon. The crab rangoon was unlike any I have tried, seemed puffier with more filling. Next day ordered the mango fried rice with chicken spice level 4 (have not seen this on any other Thai restaurants I've tried) and the drunken noodles with beed spice level 5. As typical, large portions enough for two. Excellent friendly service, quick and convenient. Additionally, found how to add them to Yelp! Glad to finally another staple Thai restaurant in the burgh!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Thai food. Went for a late night dinner with the fam and the food (and owner/server) couldn't have been more delightful. What I appreciated most was the precision of flavors - everything was super fresh, not overdone - just right. Very happy we went here for a last minute meal - we will be back!"}
{"text":"So far so good! I got the Tom kha soup and beef salad. Both were extremely fresh and flavorful. Best Thai place I've found in Pittsburgh thus far!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My go-to dish is the pad satay noodles with bean sprouts added, which always tastes superb. I usually try to order from here at least once a week, which goes to show how much I need to fulfill my Thai food craving. I prefer getting takeout or delivery, but have dined at the restaurant once and the host/server was very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here once for dinner and the food was delicious! We ordered crispy spring rolls to start, which were really yummy and fresh. I got the green curry with pork (spice level 4), and my boyfriend had the pad see yew with chicken (spice level 6). Both dishes were definitely pretty spicy so I'd play it safe if you are unsure of how much you can handle! Be warned, they do not have AC in the restaurant so if it's a hot summer day like it was when we went, you may be better off ordering takeout. Still, a great price for some really great Thai food."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good. I like that it is called Hug. Most of their dishes pair well with hugs from animals and humans and also hugs children beverages. Their green curry thing was a delight!"}
