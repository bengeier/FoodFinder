{"text":"First, their sandwiches are SOOOO good, it's painful.  Second, IKE'S is a very generous company with excellent treatment of their neighbors.  In example, they donated trays of sandwiches to our school for Teacher Appreciation Week, which was a HUGE hit with our teachers.  They even delivered them with a box of their customary caramel apple lollipops.  This is above and beyond the call of duty.  I am happy to give my business to a company with a heart, like IKE'S."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches we've found in Phoenix. This has been our favorite location so far, the staff is always upbeat, kind, and helpful. They're a little more expensive for a sandwich, but they're of a decent size (I usually only eat half) and the ingredients are always fresh.  We've tried a handful of their sandwiches- I think my favorite is # of a girl i used to know. They have TONS of choices, like A LOT. I have never had one I didn't like. While you're there try their dutch crunch for bread- it's awesome.  This location is also always clean and they have a small patio and they allow dogs out there which is also another reason we love this location!"}
{"text":"The first two times I went to Ike's, it was great. However, three out of three times following that, the bread has been severely undercooked. Like, raw. Raw dough. Raw enough that Paul Hollywood would stick his finger into it and stare at the baker in silent, disapproving shame. I hope I don't get sick from eating the delicious insides of a Ted Danson on cold, soggy, undercooked bread.   In addition to that, I paid $4.95 for mozzarella sticks and got FOUR sticks. If they were the best fried cheese sticks I'd ever had, I guess $1.25 per stick would be tolerable, way too much, but not the worst investment I could think of. Can you imagine my surprise, or rather lack thereof, when I pulled out all four of my mozzarella sticks and found them, you guessed it, undercooked.   Leave everything in the oven longer. Bread called \"Dutch Crunch\" should be crunchy, not white, soggy, and raw. I literally live one block away and will not continue to eat here or recommend it to others if this continues. Cheba Hut opened two streets away, and everything there is always appropriately baked."}
{"text":"From the person taking orders at the register who couldn't understand our orders to the very long wait for two sandwiches and two sides (at least 15 mins in an empty restaurant), to the fact they brought out our food on a tray when we'd ordered to go, the whole experience in the store was terrible. And that could have been excused if the food was good. It wasn't. It was worse than the service. A couple of thin pieces of beef were completely lost in the bread and the fistful of lettuce which was all swimming in a sauce that was eye-wateringly spicy...way, WAY hotter than the jalapeno poppers on the side. The other side was onion rings and more than half of them were burned. It's been a long time since I've actually wanted to demand my money back from a restaurant. And the prices...$37 for what I just describe. Un-f***ing-believable.  I seriously believe Ike's owes me either my money back or a free replacement meal."}
{"text":"When I saw there was an Ike's nearby, I couldn't believe it. I'd been in San Francisco and remembered loving it. Two weeks ago my husband and I went on an early Sunday afternoon. We were the only ones there and took our time deciding what to order. I ended up with the Jake the Snake. I had half and brought the rest home.  The sandwiches are pricey here, but I knew that going in. I guess I was just expecting something more, I seemed to enjoy my sandwich so much when we were in SF. I'd go back and try another sandwich at Ike's especially since its so close to home."}
{"text":"Have you ever felt so close to the spiritual realm that you could cry? That's how I felt when I tried the Meatless Mike tonight. Hands down the BEST vegan meatballs I have ever had. AND! The genius guy who took our order let us know you could add mozzarella sticks TO THE SANDWICH. I'm a better person after this meal. Genuinely kind staff and an awesome playlist. I am so glad I live within walking distance because this sh** is ridic."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I order here at least twice a month. I get the Reggie Jackson with added bbq sauce on the dutch bread. Sooooo good!!"}
{"text":"Their phone number is rarely working. The online orders I'm unable to customize. The sandwiches are great though."}
{"text":"So the only reason I downed the stars is because I have only gone to the San Diego location and that location is better. They have these amazing unique soda flavors at the San Diego one that they don't have here. They don't have tomatoes today or root beer soda at this location. The Dutch bread is different here too. And in Sd they give you a Carmel Apple pop with every sandwich. But in phx they do have burgers and French fries and onion rings here. Sandwich tastes just as amazing but not as big that's for sure. But over all happy happy and would still recommend !"}
{"text":"I heard rave reviews about this place and had to try it. After contemplating their extensive menu, I attempted to order my tuna sandwich, on gluten free bread. The cashier informed me they were out. So. Disappointed.  5/8 in our party had to modify their orders because of things they were out of too.  My sandwich, as a lettuce wrap, was okay, but I wouldn't go back for it.  Overall, the service as pretty awful. The cashier was painfully slow and seemed extremely confused.  She had to ask several of us many times to repeat our orders. Slowly, the line built up but she didn't seem to move any quicker."}
{"text":"We were running a conference at the Phoenix convention center, and we needed something to eat during load-in. Being gluten free, I usually take the initiative to find places to try that will have good gluten free stuff. I came across Ike's, ordered through Yelp for my team, and we all loved it! The gluten free bread was perfect, and the sandwich was super tasty. I would definitely recommend it. I had read that others had had issues with them running out, so I called to confirm ahead of time. Food disappointment is the worst, and I avoid it whenever possible!"}
{"text":"Eat here. Now.   Technically that's all the review I need to post--stop reading this and stop in and place your order for heaven-held bread art.   I can only speak to the gluten free bread as I have selective digestion in Celiac disease. Before I ate an Ike Sandwich, GF sandwiches were always \"meh, I'm hungry enough.\"   But Ike's has GF bread that makes you wish you could travel back in time and salmon-slap the younger you into going GF sooner.   If unicorns existed and were some kind of ascended next-level gourmet sandwich artists extraordinaire, then they'd have a hard time competing with Ike's."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were amazing, the customer service was awesome! We went on first Friday and Ike was there greeting everyone at the door! He is the absolute sweetest! I highly recommend Ike's to anyone in the area. It was such a great environment. 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"I had the Matt Cain. It was good but totally overpriced. I paid $40 for 2 sandwiches, 2 drinks and 1 order of fries. Forty dollars?? Seriously? Its a sub sandwich. Not worth the money.  Also, they were out of cups so we had to use tiny water cups. $5 for about four sips of soda.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Ike's quickly reached the top of my sandwich list after first trying them about a year ago in Tempe. When I saw this one had opened, I was stoked that I wouldn't have to make as great of a trek as I used to in order to get my fix. I have yet to be disappointed by any one of their amazing sandwiches. I continually explore new variations that pop up on the menu board. Probably my favorite sandwich is the Hot Momma (previously MILF). I really hope this one does well despite being in a predominantly hipster neighborhood where they think it's okay to order a burger from a sandwich shop (wth)?"}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches here and their unique names for them. I got the \"Steve Nash\" with no cheese and it was fantastic. Also the sourdough bread I got with it is also good."}
{"text":"Giving Ike's two stars for effort. The staff was very friendly but that's where the two stars get awarded. Sandwiches shouldn't need someone to come out and explain them so you can order. And I want to see some meat when I order a sandwich. One slice is not worth hunting for a parking space at this location. Also the sandwich wasn't all that. Just a sandwich. Not a fan of the gluten free bread, but that isn't a surprise. Gluten free bread is tasteless and bland everywhere. And what's with all the yelling of orders when everyone is within a couple of feet of each other? I guess I don't get Ike's."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich shop. I've had the 'Going Home for Thanksgiving' 3 times. The dutch crunch bread is unreal and the cranberry sriracha sauce is like nothing I've had before. I've introduced this place to a couple friends and I'm sure I'll be taking more people when I'm near an Ike's! The bbq ranch chips are heavily seasoned so that was a little unexpected but they're good nonetheless."}
{"text":"I just experienced THE BEST salmon burger I've ever tasted in my life. We're talking 4..*ahem* a lot of years. Savory with a hint of sweet in every bite. I was full half way through. Yummy!!   The staff is friendly and very patient, but a little slower than other sandwich shops. Not best if you're in a dire rush.  They take their time crafting your sandwich (yes, I said \"craft\" cause it tastes like art.) Well worth the wait.  So many vegetarian options too. Finally!! A place for my strictly vegetarian days.  I definitely will be stopping by Ike's more often."}
{"text":"Best gluten-free bread ever! Was very impressed by the options and variety. The employees were wonderful, friendly, and welcoming to us out-of-towners. Definitely swinging by again next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"So many sandwiches to choose from. I ordered a Mrs. Robinson which is a chicken, buffalo sauce so good!  I went to the downtown  Phoenix location. You can park right on the street, but make sure you download the app to pay for parking.   The person behind the counter told me they have about 700 different sandwich combinations! The bread was fresh,  and so were the toppings. So much better than other sandwich options.   They also have fries, chips, onion rings lots of sides!   I checked in & got a FREE bag of chips."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my son today.  He lives in the area and we decided to give it a try.  It was a great sandwich.  I had the #111, shredded chicken, bbq sauce, honey mustard, cheese.  I was skeptical but it was very good.  I could only eat half but my mouth wanted to eat more!.  Quite delicious.  He had the fried chicken with yellow bbq sauce, cheese on their delicious roll.  Can't remember the name of it but it was so good!!!  We will both be back!!!"}
{"text":"Meh..we wanted something quick. Didn't try the sandwiches. The descriptions looked good. Burgers  like Ok kinda tasted microwaved and not much meat. Warning mozzarella sticks stink. Overpriced 4 for $4 seriously, I've had better at a bowling alley. Blah"}
{"text":"Ordered thru uber eats and omg, love this place! Have already recommended it 3 times to different people! I had the ménage trois and my husband ordered the Steve Nash and we loved them.. sauce is amazing, subs were fresh and delicious, keep up the GREAT WORK!"}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches here. They are all realllllly good but a little bit on the expensive side being around $9-$12 a piece. The staff here seem like they are still grasping on how to run the shop and are inexperienced. Once the staff gets their act together this place could be 5 stars."}
{"text":"We walked in and they immediately turned us down because \"they haven't had service in an hour\" so they closed early... MIDNIGHT And they turned off \"the ovens\" Very disappointed in the level of service because the customers that walked in before us were able to order but we were blocked. The nice employee at the door tried to give us a lollipop but that wasn't what we were looking for."}
{"text":"I primarily order via UberEATS, but they always call to double check my order (I'm vegan so they let me know if something secretly isn't) and even offer me items outside of the UberEATS menu. Always great every time!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see that Ike's had a sandwich location here in Phoenix. Being a SF transplant and remembering staying hours in line to get a Tony Soprano when they got their fame in The Bay Area I immediately dropped everything to taste the best sandwich in the world. It was everything I remembered it to be. The sauce, the freshly baked bread, the meats! Yum! I was going to take a photo of the sandwich but i are it so fast that I forgot about it!"}
{"text":"Ah, Ike's.  The San Francisco bay legend has grown so huge they've expanded to my hometown.  Their newest location in Downtown Phoenix just opened a month ago and I'd never been to any of the Ike's locations in Cali before so the time had come to try this place out for myself.  The Downtown Phoenix location is a little hard to find (go a block south of Roosevelt on 4th Street on the bottom floor of the Roosevelt Point Apartment complex) and finding parking is an adventure (better to ride your bike or walk here), but it's well positioned to appeal to the Downtown lunch and college crowd.  The location here can comfortably seat about 25-30 inside and probably another 10-15 outside.  No crowd today though on a hot 115 degree day as I got up to the register almost right away.  The menu is quite large, so large in fact that it's literally written on the wall as you come in the door.  Take your time in studying the menu as the choices are vast.  And for vegans and vegetarians there are quite a few options here as well.  But I'm here for the one that Yelpers and celebrities like Man vs Food's Adam Richman fawn over.  The Menage A Trois.  And what a Menage A Trois it is.  Chicken, BBQ sauce, Honey (yes, real honey), Mustard (honey mustard to be exact), Lettuce, Tomato and three cheeses (Swiss, Cheddar, and Pepper Jack) all on toasted bread (I went with sourdough).  Total cost including tax comes to about $11.  My word this thing is heavenly.  I'm sure it can't be entirely good for me, but I devoured this sandwich with no regrets.  An absolutely perfect combo of flavors and ingredients.  I wouldn't change a thing about it.  Its no wonder this sandwich gets so many accolades.  I'll probably look to try the Matt Cain next (they also have sandwiches named after local Phoenix legends like Phil Mickelson, Pat Tillman, and Jake Plummer).  Downtown Phoenix now makes three Phoenix area Ike's locations with more undoubtedly on the way.  My mouth and my belly couldn't be happier."}
{"text":"I used to love coming to this place. Until I stopped by for a $3 sandwich from the previous day. The girl at the front charged me full price after I told her it was from the day before. She looked me in the eye and said the sandwiches were from today.  I bought the sandwich on Saturday. The sandwich was from Friday. Needles to say, I should have ordered a fresh sandwich if I knew I was paying full price. Anyways, 5 bucks isn't going to kill me but please train your staff. Oh, and have them look decent. The girl (you can't miss her) has this purple pinkish hair. She could have ran a brush through her hair. She looked like she had a rough night but make an effort to look decent for work, since you don't know what day of the week it is. Food five stars. I'll give you two but service is horrible."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Ike's. I've been twice now and have had great experiences (very friendly staff). Ike Shehadeh (whose cartoon face is plastered on every restaurant) opened his first restaurant ten years ago in San Francisco's Castro District after being nearly homeless. Ike's are known for their variety of sandwiches that are named after well-known celebrities. The use a bread that is popular in the Bay area called Dutch Crunch bread (or Tiger bread). The sandwiches are unique because of \"Ike's Dirty Secret Sauce\" - a creamy aioli that is baked into the bread and smeared onto the sandwiches. So far I have tried the Manage a Trois and the Meatless Mike (Vegan meatballs). The sandwiches are pretty large and the bread is very soft and moist. They have many vegetarian options and very order comes with a free caramel-green apple lollipop for dessert."}
{"text":"IKE, PLEASE READ You guys give away all your business to Cheba Hut by closing so early... You serve beer too. Let people drink it after 8 pm.. Suuuggestion (sigh)"}
{"text":"Omg I have discovered heaven on earth! I have been GF for 5 years and I haven't had a warm, toasty & yummy sandwich in years! This place was amazing and delicious. Service was great and happy hour drinks are free! I had the 'sometimes I'm a vegetarian' and it was soooo freaking good. Thank you for this place :)"}
{"text":"Oh Ike, how can something so tasty be so wrong?   On my first trip, I waited in line about the third person back. I ordered my sandwich sans a few listed items and waited 15 ish minutes for my order.  No big deal; however, after the second bite Irealized it was made incorrectly. I returned my sandwich and watched as everyone else's sandwich got made before mine was remade. I waited 15 minutes for my sandwich to begin with and had to wait another 15 for them to remake it. Normally it's not that big a deal, but on a lunch break and you're pressed for time mistakes like this mean you don't get to eat and enjoy your lunch. Hey, they gave me a free soda for the next time I come back and spend *another $17 with them... seriously, a free soda isn't going to entice me to come back to buy another $13 sandwich.  On my second visit, I ordered onion rings, which came clumped together as one big onion ring, they were happy to remake them though, and they hand picked rings that weren't all stuck together to begin with this time. By the way, the onion rings are good, but pricey and enough for two people to share as a side. During this trip I also tried to swap out the roast beef on one of their sandwiches with pastrami instead and they wanted to charge me $6. $6 for them to take off one deli meat and use another deli meat. I wasn't adding to the sandwich, simply choosing something different, what's with the super high upcharge? I chose not to swap for the sake of my wallet.  On my third visit, to go this time, I handed the cashier $20.32 in cash on a 16.32 bill. The girl stood there for a few minutes without saying anything. I wasn't sure what exactly was going on, but I chimed in with, that should be $4 change, and she replied with \"thanks, I don't know how to do math quickly in my head\". I really don't have many words to describe that one. After I got home, I found the chicken sandwich I ordered had a super thin layer of chicken spread on like a mustard and some slices of cheese on their crunch roll. I'll just take this one in the wallet, as I'm not going back to have them fix it.  In good faith, I simply can't return to Ikes. I can't spend the kind of money they charge for their sandwiches and receive the level of service I have. I'm not expecting free meals, but I do expect that when you screw up, my order is put at the head of the line when it's getting re-made, I expect to have a cashier that knows how to count and I expect food between the bun when I'm spending $13 on a sandwich.  By the way, their sandwiches are delicious in their own right, their customer service, oversights as noted and exorbitant prices are what really stink about this place. I'm guessing their prices are so high because they have had to keep making my sandwiches and onion rings over, pretty much every time I've been here. Ike, you could be so much better, I just don't see myself ever visiting again to find out."}
{"text":"Wow...now these are some good sandwiches!  We stopped in Friday afternoon to see what all the buzz is about with Ike's.  We were immediately greeted and felt so welcome...the guy who helped us was just so fun, energetic and passionate about their menu.  We ended up choosing a Steve Nash on dutch crunch and a menage a trois on wheat...some of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten...we'll definitely be back - SOON!  Get in there and check this place out...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Where to start, this place is a taste buds best adventure.  For a sandwich shop, these are amazing combinations of flavors and ideas.  So many vegetarian and vegan sandwiches as well.  Dutch crunch bread don't bother with anything else. Do yourself a favor and look at the menu online first, if possible.  There are about 600 different options between the store specific menus and the secret menu.  But if they have the ingredients they will make any sandwich from any stores menu. Sometimes they are busy and it takes a minute to get your food but it's always worth the wait and drive. Almost an hour for me and worth every mile. Ike if you are reading this your boy in Surprise wants a store.  My sandwich is the Barry Bonds but I sub cheddar.  Extra dirty sauce trust me it's addicting,  so glad they are in Arizona now. Check them out your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"Huge selection of sandwiches. The bread is delicious. I had the Pilgrim sandwich and would highly recommend it. The cranberry sriracha sauce had a great flavor. Hubby had the ménage a trois sandwich and it was also delicious. We hadn't eaten all day so we pigged out and ate both sandwiches for lunch. It was the only meal we needed that day because the sandwiches were big. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely a great place with a HUGE selection of sandwiches and quality ingredients. The staff are really nice and the sandwiches are great. The only quirk I have is tonight I ordered the Michael Jordan which is a meatball sub and for some reason there was a thousand island type sauce on the sub along with the standard meatballs, cheese and marinara which completely killed the flavor of the sandwich. I even asked if all was on it were the standard ingredients but somehow this nasty sauce wound up on it. It really killed the sandwich for me, but maybe someone else would like that. I'll still go back because they have some great sandwiches, I just hope I don't get any more surprise ingredients."}
{"text":"If you want a sub like sandwich they've got it. They make about 100 different sandwiches. I got the Lizzie, with Halal chicken, lettuce, tomatoes and Italian dressing. I'm not sure what Halal is, but it tasted like juicy shredded chicken. The bread was excellent, It was Dutch crunch like, a sub French bread but with a little crunch. I like the fact that this sub was more meat than bread. It was also hot, really good."}
{"text":"Personal favorite is the Michael Jordan. I love how these sandwiches are so different than what you would normally get at a sub shop but still so delicious! Quick pick up and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service plus the food is amazing and so many delicious options to choose from!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at any Ike's locations. We arrived just as they were opening and had plenty of time to look over the menu. I ended up getting a Rosewell (also known as the Randy Johnson at their location) and OH. MY. GOD. I have never been a sandwich person. You will never catch me saying I'm EVER in the mood for sandwiches. But you know what? I will only ever be in the mood for Ike's. It was incredible - you can tell they put a lot of work into the sandwiches they create. My boyfriend got the Meatless Mike (vegetarian) and was equally impressed with his choice. We plan to go back again and order take-out/delivery in the future. These sandwiches are worth the price, I promise!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The staff is super friendly. The restaurant decor is awesome: cartoons and pictures of Ike and celebs, old school lunch boxes and chalk drawn menus! Ike's is awesome!"}
{"text":"Wow. I've never been here before but the sandwiches and fries were spectacular!!!! The atmosphere is fun, the people were very nice and the music was perfect! I wish we had one of these closer to home!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff.  I had a guy immediately explain the menu to me and basically told me that they can make any sandwich. They have tons of vegetarian options. And I got a free Lolipop with my Purchase. I was sold. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've tried Ike's once before but didn't care for it. I thought I'd give it another go to see if my thoughts about it had changed. It hasn't. First off, I wanted to taste the tuna but they said they don't allow taste tests...that was odd. I ended up getting a mediocre sandwich which was recommended to me. I asked them to go easy on the sauce and it was still a very soggy sandwich. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"First and foremost, the staff are extemely friendly and talkative. They'll break down each sandwich for you if you ask. They've been trained to know how to make over 100 different ones.  One could complain about the prices, as some of them do seem kind of steep in price, BUT Ike's does offer a happy hour in the middle of the day Mon-Fri, which includes a drink, and they do throw discount coupons your way for next time if you're nice.  Many different and creative sandwich names to choose from (over 400 total?), and the ones I've tried so far have been great. This time I ordered a We're JUST Friends, and enjoyed it very much. I'll definitely be back to try another."}
{"text":"I LOVE Ike's and, as such, was incredibly surprised and delighted to see the welcoming sign above the door when I was traveling through downtown Phoenix for work. The taste of the sandwiches is only surpassed by the unique traits each possesses, both in name and in flavor. I found the Menage a Trois to be particularly good this time, although I've preferred the Andrew Luck at the San Jose location. Would highly, highly recommend coming here to try the sandwiches, and the chips & soft drinks are a fun variety too. The free lollipop handed out with each sandwich is a great touch, too."}
{"text":"The idea of this place and the vibe were very cool when I walked in it was on first Fridays so it was pretty packed they have their service down pretty quick and I was very excited because they offered vegan sandwiches ordered fries and took a recommendation on the best vegan sandwich the fries were probably an 8.5 out of 10 sandwich was definitely 3.5 out of 10.  May have to give this place another shot when it's less packed."}
{"text":"My family stopped in here for a quick dinner. I must say it was a fabulous choice. I had one of their vegetarian sandwiches on their world famous bread. So yummy!!  They were also very accommodating to my daughters request of a bacon sandwich with just lettuce!  We will be back again!"}
{"text":"I returned to Ike's once again because it's amazing! I tried a meat sandwich this time- halal chicken, avocado, pepper jack, zesty orange glaze (\"We're Just Friends\") and once again, it didn't not disappoint! My friends both enjoyed their orders as well. One of them had the regular burger and said that it was really good. The other got mozzarella sticks but commented that it wasn't worth the price, only because it was such a small portion for $5-$6 appetizer.  It's true. Ike's sandwiches are more on the pricey side ($10-$12). But it is a treat every once in a while! Will definitely return again til I've tried everything on the menu haha"}
{"text":"We ordered the Menage a Trois and the Anchor Man for delivery through Uber Eats. The sandwiches were very good and a nice size, but we thought that the add-on on the order page was for a SIDE of mozzarella sticks and jalapeño poppers, but were disappointed to find they had put it ON the sandwich and there was only 1 of each on there. The taste was good, but not worth the extra $6 and made the sandwiches look kinda unattractive. Ended up paying about $40 (including tip) for 2 sandwiches. That was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Ike is such a sweetie! He gave me a hug on the grand opening night when I asked what the \"love\" in the sandwich is. The food is great! Prices are fair for what you get! I recommend their house bread and aioli dressing. You also get a free caramel apple lollipop, VERY cool!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since I moved to Phoenix last summer and I figured it was time to say something about one of the best sandwich shops that I've ever been too. I've tried a few different sandwiches, will be trying the burgers soon, and I've never been disappointed! Even when the sandwich wasn't really my taste (meaning trying something I don't usually go for) the sandwich was still A+, it just wasn't my favorite flavor. There are options for vegans, halal, and the combinations are endless. Plus a happy hour $3 beers after 3PM. I will continue to eat here until I go back home to Los Angeles and, believe me, I will sorely miss this place."}
{"text":"Well this is my fourth and last try at this sandwich place. Originally came here because they had gluten free bread. Had their meatball sandwich the first time which was good so I decided to come back. Next I tried their chicken sandwich with orange sauce, didn't like it at all. It tasted like orange chicken from panda express. Next visit I tried a Turkey and roast beef sandwich going for something more traditional. Wasn't that impressive but I figured I'd give it one more shot. Tried their philly cheesesteak version. The meat was extremely dry with not much flavor. I'm done trying, dont like most of their stuff."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with the service. I ordered online to make sure I could have time to eat my sandwich on my 30 minute lunch break. Well, I stood at the counter for over 10 minutes before someone even asked me what I wanted to order, come to find out that the order wasn't even in the process of being made. 3 people walked out while I was waiting. She offered to cancel the order. That doesn't help me after I've left work and waited but then not actually have food.  I love the food but the service has made it that I won't come back for lunch ever again."}
{"text":"I needed a pastrami fix and Ike 's saved my soul.  I got the Paul Rubens and was given a second chance at life! I semi regularly try out new (to me) places and Ikes's was today's winner on the wheel! Juicy, delicious and spectacular describe my visit this afternoon. The menu is so twisted and appealing, there is no doubt in my mind that I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Way to much sauce and way to expensive. Smh   It's a sandwich. And its doesn't come with chips but if you check in you get chips. :)"}
{"text":"To start, I love Ike's.  However, this location sucks.  Too often they're out of chicken or toppings or closing early and when those things are ok, the customer service is atrocious.  You can get a sandwich for way less at a national chain and expect at least average customer service: why is it so hard for a chain that charges 13 dollars a sandwich to find decent help?  Customer service and communication is horrible.  Ps: no one prints out coupons anymore: take them off the phone like everyone else."}
{"text":"Awesome subs with great customer service. There Thanksgiving sub is particularly good. Also plenty of tasty vegan and vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I drive for Uber Eats , so I'm exposed to a lot of restaurants and sandwich shops. I've delivered for Ike's on several occasions and noticed their menu is quite unique. Today was my first time ordering a sandwich,  I ordered the Tony Soprano, it was simply fantastic ! A great combination of meats and cheese on my choice of sourdough, I simply loved this sandwich, can't wait to try another one off their menu,maybe the menage a trois will be next. By the way the staff is always very courteous and friendly I look forward to my next visit"}
{"text":"Super impressed with the staff! Super attentive, polite, and amazingly energetic.  Our food was great, and the service outstanding!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid, 3.5 stars. I'd only been once to their Tempe location so when I saw that they had a spot in downtown Phoenix, I had to stop by. There's lane restrictions around this area (4th St and Roosevelt) so I wasn't sure about parking and I parked a block away and walked over. However there's a garage behind the restaurant that offers free 2 hour parking. I came during a down time, after lunch and before dinner and checked out the vast menu on the wall. I chose The Handsome Owl, which has vegan chicken, wasabi mayo, teriyaki and Swiss cheese. I'm not a big fan of wasabi but I asked how strong it was and they said they don't use much so it's not overpowering. They're great about substituting after I noticed a meat sandwich that I wanted to try, so next time I'll have to do that. My sandwich was pretty good, I always set higher expectations for them and I end up being a bit dissatisfied. But it might be cuz I took my sandwich home and didn't get to eat it until later. They've got some unique creations and fun names.   Love that their menu is veg friendly and you can narrow it down to meat, vegetarian, vegan or gluten free. This place had a cool vibe to it and the cashier was super friendly, making conversation as I waited for my sandwich. They gave me coupons which was nice and I'll probably be back to try some other menu items."}
{"text":"Its always better to come in and eat or pick up your lunch order. The staff is friendly and the food is good. The Vegan options are delicious."}
{"text":"Well, ya' get what ya' pay for.   It's a nice, clean, if not barren, place. And it's a national chain.  Sadly as of this visit they currently do not have their shit together. Not even a little.  1) The staff (manager included) couldn't figure out how to place a hamburger order into their POS.  2) There was no salt! Like seriously, I asked and they couldn't come up with any SALT!!!  3) And then they fucked up my order (ummm, \"plain with nothing on it\" seemed pretty direct, but no).  It's their 5th day open so ... but seriously? No salt?!? They serve fries, and had no f'n salt! Crazy.   Anyway I had a burger and fries. The two patty burger (\"Hamburgler\") was pretty darn good, not great, but certainly worthy of the $5 it cost. The fries were battered (think Arby's) and I'm not a big fan of such nonsense, but for what they were, they were \"not bad\".  Living 2.5 blocks away, I had high hopes, and I'm sure over time they will pull their shit together so we'll see.   I shall update the progress here."}
{"text":"finally tried it and yep, it is as good as people say. i was suspicious because sometimes people praise lackluster sandwich shops but Ikes did not disappoint. had the special of the day and when they handed it to me it was heavy as a brick! its a little pricey for a sandwich but you really get what you pay for. i am already anticipating going back to try more of the seemingly endless menu."}
{"text":"Ike's is the best sandwich shop ever!!!!  The bread, quirky combinations and beverage variety covers every palate. Some of our family favorites are: God is \"Sometimes I'm A Vegetarian\". My hubby's favorite is the Madison Bumgarner. You are the"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are amazing - absolutely love the vegan selection."}
{"text":"Ate here 4-5 times, very consistent taste. I ordered the Steve Nash on Dutch white bread, for $8.99 + tax it's a bit pricey but makes up for it with taste. Big fan of the culture and service at Ike's as well. Wish they less expensive items on the menu though 4/5"}
{"text":"Came in for a sandwich, chips, and beer on first Friday. The place was busy but service was great. My wife had the Pilgrim vegan style and I had the Green Goblin. Both were great! This was our first time ever eating at an Ike's and we will be back. My only complaint, and it is minor, is that the place looks a bit cafeteriaesk. The walls are brightly colored but the floor is cement and the place has tables and chairs everywhere. It could use some more work. The food is definitely more expensive than average but definitely worth it because of the quality. But paying that much I guess I expect a little bit more than eating at a place that looks like a subway restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered through uber eats because I work at the hospital and couldn't leave the floor when I was working. I had never ordered before and decided to ordered the Matt Cain as it sounded delicious on the menu. When my order came I was so disappointed. They put sooo much mayo on the sandwhich and I don't even like mayo! Didn't know it came on all their sandwiches till I came to leave a review.  So disappointed because otherwise I think I would have enjoyed it. Ended up tossing it and just eating my Zapp's chips (which were tasty)."}
{"text":"I love Ike's sandwiches! As a Bay Area transplant it reminds me of home. They have a huge selection of sandwiches, including vegetation and vegan options. I'm a big fan of the Matt Cain and Tony Soprano. I went to this location for the first time on lunch. A positive is that this location has brews on tap. They were surprisingly out of lettuce so it changed the dynamic of the sandwich a little. The customer service rep must have been having a bad day. She was border line rude and when my sandwich was ready she literally dropped it in front of me.  Still I love their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Like .. really really love it. It has something for everyone.   I am obsessed with the \"Vegan Xtina.\" It's buffalo \"chicken\" with Swiss, lettuceC tomato, and dirty sauce. I get it on the amazing Dutch bread.   The fries have a nice spice to them, and I get mine with a side of their vegan dirty sauce.   If I can bring myself to stop getting the Xtina I'm going to try the vegan goblin next time! Check out their website.. it has like 600 sandwiches that can be made and you can order pretty much anything you like!"}
{"text":"I love the meatless Mike! They have the absolute  best-meatless meatball sandwich I have ever had! Cool place, options for everybody."}
{"text":"I'm not sure on what planet ONE mozzarella stick and ONE jalapeno popper is worth $4 being added to your order, especially when they didn't even get delivered with my order... but I won't be dining here again.  I work at a large business nearby.  My boss and I had a two hour meeting over lunch to discuss an integration.  Our lunch was $40 for two people, did not include everything we ordered (which was apparently $4 for two pieces of food), and her lunch made her sick.   We contacted the restaurant to see what they'd do about the incomplete order and they said, \"Too bad, so sad.\"   Spend your money at a much more deserving small business."}
{"text":"So good! Called in a fairly large to-go order for an office lunch today and Ike's had them ready when we picked up 30 minutes later. The guy on the phone was so nice and helpful and didn't even seem bothered by my order, like some places can be. Everyone raved about how good their sandwiches were and the bread is delicious! I got the Phil Mickelson and it was amazing... just so yummy! They are priced higher than most sandwich shops, but the sandwiches are so big you can definitely get two meals out of it. Will be coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fat sandwich to fill you up this is the place. The Ménage à trois is so good. It's the perfect combo of sweet and spicy if you add jalapeños."}
{"text":"Sandwich heaven! So after growing up eating subs all over the place, I unfortunately developed a severe gluten allergy.  For years I was forlorn about never having a good sub again but then I discovered Ike's! The gf sub roll is excellent not to mention all the goodies inside! Ike's menu is extensive and slightly intimidating but they have it all. My fav is the Paul Reubens. The coleslaw is crunchy and pairs with the pastrami perfectly. The workers are always upbeat and helpful. I love this place! I'm also slightly biased, being a rabid Bay Area sports fan coupled with one of my former students being the Phoenix location's GM.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly, especially Kail. Very helpful and the service is quick and accurate."}
{"text":"I ordered a sandwich with fried chicken and jalapeños with some jalapeño chips on the side. This dude asked if I wanted the chips IN the sandwich. I went for it and was really glad I did. 10/10 -- I'll be asking for that again sometime. These are some dark wizards of sandwichry we're dealing with."}
{"text":"I had bookmarked Ike's for sometime as I wanted to check out why they had such high stars. Well, I wasn't disappointed I'll tell you that! As a matter of fact, my visit was better than I had anticipated and that's always a nice surprise. For starters it's a casual order at the counter and sit down fast/casual restaurant. Upon walking in I was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of sandwiches available. I thought this was a vegan place but turns out, not exactly. It's a vegan, vegetarian, regular meat eaters type of sandwich place and I do not exaggerate when I say there's 100s of combos. Oh boy! I finally decided on the ET which was mock fried chicken, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, special sauce, choice of cheese and I got it on their signature bread which did not disappoint. My gf ordered the \"Going home for Thanksgiving\" which is turkey, cranberries, havarti and sriracha on the signature bread as well, she said it was \"AMAZING\". So, needless to say we are going back to Ike's next time I'm feeling like a nice sandwich or sub. As a vegetarian I am not a fan of veggie sandwiches, so it's really nice to have so many options at a place like Ike's. Absolutely dee-lish! Also, I don't want to forget to say that the staff that helped us at the counter and brought our food to the table were awesome! They suggested which breads would work best, and were super friendly/personable. What more could anyone want? Treat yo self and go to Ike's for lunch or dinner or do take out and go have a picnic."}
{"text":"Great service and great food, doesn't get better than That! I always get the Winnie the Pooh. It's ahhhhmazing! They never short you on ingredients either!"}
{"text":"Omg I love Ike's...as vegetarians we love Ike's! Love love love. Try the vegetation pilgrim amazing. Their sandwiches are pricey but well worth it! Watch out for up charges though they add up quick (esp. If you choose a vegetarian version of what is normally a meat sandwich)"}
{"text":"Holy crap!!!! This place is amazing!!!! I ate \"the pumpkin\" on their crunchy bread - phenomenal. I can't wait to come back and try another vegetarian sandwich -- there are literally a thousand options!! My cousin loved their gluten free bread and she said it's the best she's ever had.   Back a second time --- meatless mike is amazing !"}
{"text":"HOLY MOLY! I think I found a diamond in here.  I've passed by this sandwich shop a few times and noticed they where finally opened. Since it is very close to where I work, I decided to stop in for lunch and see why it has so many 5 stars on yelp. From the moment I stepped in, everyone was happy to help me find the right sandwich I was craving. I ordered the Jaymee Sirewich and it was like a party in my mouth. Juicy and tasty fried chicken, their BBQ was an amazing touch, but my favorite part of it all was Ike's World Famous Dutch Crunch French Bread. I immediately sent a picture of this sandwich and sent the menu to my hubby. Well guess what we are having for dinner tonight...YUP, IKES!!"}
{"text":"Ike's has really good sandwiches - there's a lot of options and their bread and halal chicken are outstanding. However, all their sandwiches are 8-12$ and that doesn't include chips and drinks.  I would give this place 4 stars, but my lunch experience at Ike's was overall subpar. The cashier was nice and friendly, but overly forgetful even though the place was not busy. It took 20 minutes to get two sandwiches out, even though there were only 2 other people in the restaurant. They forgot to bring out my chips, side of avocado, and sriracha sauce. I asked when they delivered the sandwiches and ended up going up to the counter to get my chips after about 5 minutes. Since a group of 3 had just walked in and started ordering, I asked for my chips which were right in front and reminded the cashier of my sides. He apologized and said he'd get them right out. After waiting another 10 minutes, I walked up to the counter again and saw him grab the basket of my sides and walk out. By this time, it had already been 15 minutes and I was already over halfway done with my food. He also mistakenly gave me hot sauce instead of sriracha. By that point, my lunch break had already been too long between ordering and waiting for my food (a sandwich shouldn't take 20 minutes?). Good food, but the service was just not there especially for how empty the place was. Two sandwiches, chips, and 1 drink came out to be about $27 and took about 45 minutes. I might go back for dinner, but this definitely isn't a lunch place considering how long it took to get my food out."}
{"text":"I love Ike's! The Jeremey Stoppleman sandwich is my favorite. Yes it's veggie but it doesn't feel like it. They do not skimp on the toppings and ingredients. You will be full and you will be satisfied until your next Ike's craving. By the way their Thanksgiving sandwich is also a favorite."}
{"text":"Visited Ike's on First Friday last month. They handed out free samples as we passed by. So good we had to come back later that night to eat. They're friendly and on point."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches. A bit pricey but still really great quality, and some good music is playing. Minimal drink selection. Ample seating for anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Got into the promotion of buy one sandwich get one free from channel 3 morning news.  Ordered the Matt Cain (Roast Beef) and Paul Rubens (Pastrami), which in the Tempe Location is the Cain Velasquez.   Love the specialty Cruch bread but they were out so got the Sourdough and Wheat respectively. The bread at Ike's is always great and one of the better bread offered in town.I do like the Crunch Bread which at first I did not know if I liked it, but having it a second time I loved it.  The sandwiches are large and can be shared and expect the cost of the sandwich to be $10 to $11.  I like the names of the sandwiches which are geared to local sports figures at different reastaurant locations.  BTW, they have awesome Ike TShirts that have Star Wars geared for Ike's.  I Like Ike!"}
{"text":"Been driving past this place everyday for the last year, decided to give it a try. DAMN THESE SANDWICHES ARE GOOD! By far one the best sandwiches I've had. I ordered the Bear Hug...DELICIOUS. Both guys working the place were SUPER friendly and helpful. Great customer service and even better tasting food. I will most definitely try the rest of the menu out. They have a really good Happy Hour, if you like to have an adult beverage with your food."}
