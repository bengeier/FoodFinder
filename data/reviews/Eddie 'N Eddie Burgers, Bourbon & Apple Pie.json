{"text":"Melt had an hour wait...on a Sunday afternoon at 2:30. Stopped in across the street and was very glad I did. The fried pickles with pastrami was ridiculous. Who does that? SO good. My burger was juicy and delicious. Service was outstanding."}
{"text":"We came upon this place by accident, drawn in by the awning that boasted burgers, bourbon, and apple pie.  Yes, yes, and yes!  It was a Thursday afternoon and the place was pretty quiet, there were a few scattered tables of lunching ladies.  We were seated by the window where we could clearly see Melt across the street; people smashed against one another, fighting for air, dying just to get a grilled cheese.  The fools!  Our server was defiantly one of the best I have ever had, he was conversational and helpful, willing to point out signature dishes and what he thought was delicious.  In the two times I've had their food I've been able to try all three of their titular items.  Let me break it down:
1.  The burgers-  I've had both the beef and falafel persuasions.  The beef is everything a carnivore wants in a greasy, juicy burger.  The falafel had a fabulous salsa on top of it, but the patty itself was a little dry.  All burgers come with a side and I tried both types of potato croquettes- if you like sweet potatoes as much as I do, you'll die when you taste theirs.  The other kind (honey sage) are delectable as well.
2.  The bourbon-  If there's one thing I know a lot about it's booze, specifically whiskey and bourbon.  I have had my fair share of Manhattans and the one I had on this particular visit was the best I have ever imbibed.  I cannot even put into words how fantastic it was; it showcased our server's immaculate bartending skills.
3.  The Pie-  Oh my goodness, the pie.  I usually don't order dessert.  I'm more of a second helping kind of gal rather than a save room for dessert type person.  This pie-apple cranberry- was amazing.  It tasted like butter and sugar and caramel and apples and America and freedom.  It made me want to stand up and testify.  A person having the worst of days could take one bite of this pie and be cured of their foul mood in seconds, I am sure of this.
I strongly urge everyone to check this place out, you shan't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really disappointed! Been here twice.  Not impressed the first time, but kept hearing wonderful things, so we tried it again. 
We were immediately disappointed that we were sat at our table for 7 minutes, before we got a \"drive-by\" hello, I'll be right with you.  
We started with the beet salad and the Cobb salad; the beets were flavorless and there were maybe three or four quartered pieces in the salad; however, the cobb, although not unique, was good.  
For our meals, we both got burgers. The temps were spot on, but there were pieces of plastic on my burger.  
Not impressed. Not interested in returning."}
{"text":"We had a groupon which we used this week. For 2 burgers and an appetizer (no drinks) the bill came to around $35 (pre-groupon). Burgers range from $10-15 (which is a little steep for a burger in my opinion). Still, the burgers had good flavor and there were lots of interesting combos to try. 

My husband had the Eddie n Eddie burger and I tried the Kentukiyaki burger. Both had good flavor although the Kentukiyaki could have benefited from just a little bit more sauce.My husband had the bourbon baked beans on the side. Both agreed we wouldn't order them again. Was expecting a rich, deep flavor. They were in a thin sauce with an average flavor (not offensive but certainly not good). Our one year old polished them off though...lol. I had the sweet potato fries on the side which were great, the sauce was fun too. Almost like a unique honey-mustard. We ordered onion rings as an appetizer. Big portion size with two dipping sauces. The sauces were good, but weren't anything groundbreaking. 

Service was fast and efficient. We overall liked the casual (but not fast food casual) atmosphere. I would come back here again if we had another groupon or coupon. Also, the brunch looks intriguing. Otherwise, I can think of better meals for the price. It was good, just a little expensive for burgers and onion rings as I said earlier."}
{"text":"Burgers?  Bourbon?  Apple Pie?  Hello...that's the trifecta of awesomeness!
Try the Kentuckyaki Burger and/or the honey sage potato croquette and your life will change.  (Well, not literally, but both are really good so try them anyway)."}
{"text":"We had a GREAT experience here.  I noticed this place about a month ago while eating dinner at Melt across the street and was very intrigued because the awnings said \"Burgers, Bourbon, Apple Pie.\"  What a great combination!

My mom, boyfriend and I met for dinner on a weeknight because we had seen it PACKED on the weekend.  We were glad to be able to sit down immediately at 6pm on a Wednesday.  The decor is very cool, half of it looks like a diner and the other half has a swanky bar.  

I loved that the menu had a long list of burgers, salads and appetizers but then at the bottom had a few weekly specials that depended on the day as well as a few standard Italian meals for those who were not in the mood for a burger.  (I suggest visiting their website for a little history on the owners that explains what seems like an inconsistent addition to the menu http://eddieneddie.com/ )

I got the E n' E burger because everything sounded good and I figured I might as well try the signature burger on my first visit.  Then you get to chose from one of the sides I chose the sweet potato croquettes (I fell in LOVE with croquetas when I studied abroad in spain in college so anytime I see them on a menu I HAVE to have them).  These were nothing like spanish croquetas but they were tastey!.  The burger was fantastic, the blends of meat are very fresh and was cooked perfectly!  It was way too big for me to eat more than half.

Boyfriend got the Kentuckyaki burger and by the time I went to ask him for a bite it was gone so he loved it.  He got the honey sage potato croquettes and let me try one of those...AWESOME!

My mom got a plain burger with cheddar and loved hers as well.  She got fries and shared, very well seasoned and tasty.

The service was fast and pleasant.

We loved all of our food but did not have room for the apple pie...next time!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I used to love this restaurant until today.  I walked by and saw the beautiful APOC tables that were covered up by a table cloth.  
APOC stands for: A Piece Of Cleveland.   How do you cover up a beautiful piece of art with a plain white tablecloth. How disrespectful."}
{"text":"Was up visiting Cleveland from NC and tried to get into Melts which is across the street, but there was a 2 hour wait for a table, so we ventured to Eddie n' Eddie, got a table in 15 minutes and were quite pleased. 

Our server, Josh, was on the ball and knew the menu. 

For appetizers, ordered some homemade cornbread which was good, and some deep fried pickels with proscuitto. Everything was prepared nicely and tasted good. 

For beer, Josh suggested the Christmas brew, and it was phenomanal. The other beer drinkers in my group were pleased with their choices as well-- especially the Kentucky Bourbon brew. 

The burgers came out cooked to temp, and my chicken burger was delish. The ingrediants tasted fresh and of high quality. Also had a cup of stuffed cabbage soup which was decent. 

All in all, the service was great, and all 5 of us enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"Like others, we tried Melt across the street first but even at 4:30 on Saturday,  they were an hour plus wait. So we said \"let's check it out\". Server was slow and not as attentive as we expected. She was okay - but not great. First negative was my beverage glass wasn't clean.  I couldn't find the server to quietly ask for a replacement. When the runner brought our dinner I asked him to have her come by. He was several feet away and said okay but what do you need? So I said a clean glass of iced tea. He didnt seem happy I said it but ... Food was good. For an app we tried fried pickles that come wigh corned beef and 1000 island dressing and spring mix. Tasty . I had the London burger and my husband the buffalo chicken burger ( not really a burger but a chicken sandwich). I had their onion rings for a side. Good but needed salt and none on the table and no server (see above!). The desert we shared was bourbon pecan pie. It was good but while finishing, a commotion occurred at the table next to me where two fellows were bussing. I turn and realize there is ketchup all over my coat. It was on the cover of the beer menu which was laying on the bench seat next to me. It was all over my coat and the bussers were just staring at it. Our server came by and saw the situation and my feeble attempt at wiping it with my napkin. She offered a towel and brought one with club soda in a mug. Nice but how about having my coat cleaned? It is so soiled I couldn't wear it to the car. It was 29 degrees according to the sign on the bank across the street.  And it was snowing.  Overall not too impressed.  Next time we'll wait the hour at Melt. Btw this was started by the grandson of Carrie Cerino. Been to their catering place for a wedding. Not impressed there either."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. I've had a few things there now. Soup is always great, and the apple pie is fantastic."}
{"text":"The most impressed I've been with a restaurant in a long time. 

I'd been looking forward to trying Eddie 'N Eddie ever since I heard of its opening over the summer. I am a HUGE fan of Pizzeria Cerino, and was very excited about this new place in Lakewood (because it's not too often that I'm in Seven Hills). 

Plus, it's always important for me to find great, reliable restaurants that are not cookie-cutter chains, nor are they too upscale because we have kids. Eddie 'N Eddie strikes this balance excellently. Along with Deagan's (which I've been having problems with for a long time) and Jammy Buggars, this place is a good go-to for a weeknight or weekend late afternoon where you can feel not too self-conscious about your little ones, because the environment is loud. Plus, they have way above average food and good beer (and I guess bourbon, though I wouldn't know how to judge that).

We were there with our infant, 2-year-old, and another couple who also had an infant. They could not have been more accommodating. They put us in a corner with more than enough room but which was out of the way. This was great for two reasons: one, we didn't disturb other patrons. Two, we didn't feel as though we had to keep dodging servers walking by and worrying that the kids were going to get in the way.

Now for the food. I had a half roasted beet salad, which was great and very generous for a half-salad. A whole one could have definitely filled me up for dinner. We also tried the lettuce wraps, which were fine but would have been even better with some dipping sauce(s), as well as the cornbread -- served piping hot in a skillet, with orange marmalade and butter.

I couldn't NOT have the chicken pot pie, which was quite possibly the BEST pot pie ever! Flaky, buttery, soft crust, with huge chunks of white meat chicken, vegetables (not frozen peas and carrots, but real fresh veggies), and a delicious gravy that tasted unfamiliar, yet delicious. It wasn't that usual cornstarchy gravy you get in a pot pie.

My husband tried a chicken burger and it was great, and our friends got the Kentuckyaki burger and the E 'n E  burger. They were both able to get a whole-wheat bun instead of a white one. Also, the sides include any number of delicious things, not just fries (although that is one side). I did the half salad (+3.5) for my side, my husband did the sweet potato croquettes, others had the Italian wedding soup. All amazing.

Anyway, the service was really outstanding. Our waitress' name was Teresa and she deserves props! I loved this place and will be making a habit of coming here. Not pretentious, but not a soulless chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Good bourbon choices and great burgers. Have to try the root beer wings! Great homemade pies."}
{"text":"Just came from Eddie 'N Eddie this evening (Wed.).  No problem getting a table as there were openings the entire time we were there.

This was the second time we have been there with the first being a few weeks ago for a weekday lunch.

The family had burgers and the pot pie (only available Sun. and Wed.).  The first time we had the chicken burger, salads and dessert.

Overall we enjoyed our experience better the first time.  Granted, everything was ok this time, however nothing stood out to us as \"excellent, can't wait to return\".  For me personally, I would prefer the Buckeye Beer Engine or B-Spot for a burger.  Both my daughter and wife said the pot pie was good or acceptable, although neither raved about it.  Based on my forkfull, I'd agree with their assessment - it's good, you will enjoy it but I think you could just as good elsewhere.

Both times we have had the daily soups and they were excellent.
Service both times was very good.

Beer selection was good/very good ... I wouldn't say great but I do think beer fans will find something to try.

While I would encourage someone to go because the quality is there, we just are not ones to immediately run back there."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.  The honey bourbon grilled salmon was delicious.  For the average person, though, the salmon portion was extremely small but for me it was perfect.  It seems they are more interested in serving up heaping portion of side dishes.  I opted for the baked beans and French fries.  Their fries are killer, killer good.  They are up there with Lola fries for sure...crispy, rosemary and garlic.  Service was attentive.  I look forward to going back and exploring more menu items."}
{"text":"I'm not a drinker so I may have missed the best thing in this joint. Clearly, it's not the beef burgers.  I'd give them a 1 1/2 star if I could. For the price, the burgers are just OK. I had the signature EnE burger. I asked for the Aoili on the side and when I tasted it, it was like watered down salad dressing. The rest of the toppings on the burger were so-so. The outstanding meal-saver were the Onion Rings. These were supurb. Light, tempura-coated, cooked properly. Just first-rate! At the other end of the spectrum was the apple pie. Ugh! My wife and I each had a bite and left the rest on the plate. Eddie's grandmother would have turned over in her grave. The crust was cardboard-y and the apple filling was bland and tasted like it had been around a while. I was slightly surprised that I mentioned our unhappiness about the pie to our server and received no response other than a comment that we were wrong because pies are made every day (and it stayed on our bill.)
I may go back to try the chicken pot pie, but probably not because I can guess what the crust will taste like."}
{"text":"Yum! I had a great meal here. Portobello mushroom and goat cheese on a sandwich makes me a happy girl! 

Everything else was pretty solid, as well. I had onion rings and split a pretzel app with my boyfriend. The others in my group got burgers and potato croquettes, which we learned were basically mashed potato balls (what's not to love about that?) 

The vibe is nice and the service was pretty solid though we did feel a tad rushed. It's a great location and it'll be a nice alternative if Melt's wait is too long. :) 

Also, they have a different apple pie on the menu every week and I definitely dig that idea!"}
{"text":"We met here for a friend's birthday on a busy Saturday night. We made reservations since we had a larger group. 
I was curious what the Cerino boys would do. 
I liked the casual and classy atmosphere. Red, sleek and modern design. Open kitchen window. 

The service was good and attentive. We had a group of 6 and she managed us well. 
My husband had the e'N'e burger. He was impressed. His medium well burger was perfectly cooked. It was just the right size, had just the right amount of stuff and DIDN'T FALL APART! This, he tells me,  is key. 
I ordered the brussels sprouts salad and the honey sage potato croquettes.  It was a lot of salad for a $7 half which was a nice surprise. The greens were fresh and the mix ins were tasty. I would have liked a few more sprouts, but it could just be because I LOVE sprouts. The honey sage croquettes were very good. The two in the order were just the right amount. Full of flavor, loved the savory and the sweetness. My husband ordered the sweet potato croquettes. They were good but mine were better. His reminded me of pancakes. 
The birthday guest had the baked ravioli. It looks amazing and tasted amazing. He generously let me have a bite. Cheesy, gooey, saucey! yummy!
However... my friend was less than impressed with the BBQ root beer wings. He was hoping for a more root beer flavor. It could have been the afterglow effect. Everyone was raving about the wings but they were just wings. 

The menu had a few vegetarian options which I appreciated being a burger place. I was looking forward to the falafel burger, but they changed it to a portobello. 
The service was excellent. Since it was a birthday, my dropped off a the awesome cake she bought earlier in the. The staff brought it out full of candles at the end of our meal. The birthday guest of honor couldn't have been more surprised. 

Eddie and Eddie's has good prices for good food. About $13-$15 for a full size entree"}
{"text":"We gave the place a try on a Friday night, early.  It was still Happy Hour, but a goofs time to bring in a toddler.  It's a noisy place, with hard surfaces abounding ... But we view that as a plus with a toddler; they tend to do better in noisy places!  Service was very attentive, very efficient, and QUICK!  We had a very short wait for our apps, and the dinner came soon thereafter.

And the food was quite good.  We started off with onion rings, which were very lightly battered, tasted a bit like panko.  Very nicely done, especially with the bourbon honey mustard dipping sauce.  My wife had the Kentuckyaki Burger, which she enjoyed.  The meat was high-quality, the grilled pineapple was fresh (not canned), and the burger was cooked to perfection.  Her only complaint was the sauce ... She felt the burger could have more on it, rather than just a very small dollop.  She had the sweet potato croquettes as a side dish, which were tasty, but we both thought they'd be better if they were smaller.  I had the Pepper Pollo burger, which was made out of ground chicken.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it was moist and full of flavor.  No complaints, not even room for improvement, because it was really tasty!  I had the french fries with it, which were good.  I confess we didn't have any apple pie dessert, as we were stuffed ... But my toddler enjoyed a cupcake, which was pretty darned good.

Prices weren't too bad for the quality and quantity of food ... My most major complaint was the fact that there's no real Kid's menu. Other than they'll make some mini-burgers and they have \"chicken strips\" which is actually a chicken patty that they slice into strips.  But I will say in their favor that it WAS really good chicken.

Add all this up with a warm and stylish interior and a prime location in Downtown Lakewood, and it's a recipe for success, and a nice addition to Lakewood's array of eateries."}
{"text":"I heard loud band playing next door, another new establishment, beer blast gastr-ohno. I had the confidence that E 'N E could make a better destination. I visited on a Sunday, Cinco de Mayo.

I liked the place okay and will probably comeback another time. I had recommendation from bartender for special of grilled chicken and ribs, two sides, 15 bucks. Good deal and better meal. The kitchen line had views of the television screens. We were all watching basketball playoffs. In between preparation of meals for servers, cooks would voice some hoots and hollers for the compelling dunks of Carmelo. He has a great name and sure can dunk.

A theme is around the bourbon cask and metal hoops accent the restaurant. I guess this is okay and enhances theme established with Northeast Ohio B Spot restaurants. I would take off a star if Eddie had not already had a solid burger themed restaurant back in the day. The whiskey list had Blanton's and Booker's so at least someone knows what is up with the booze. Lakewood legit, A-OK."}
{"text":"With a selection of craft beers and pub fare, Eddie 'n Eddie (father and son) really seems poised to become a long term institution in the Lakewood area.  There is a fusion aspect to their selection, which is cute, and reasonably charming.

I think the whole affection that the proprietors have for the neighbourhood is palpable."}
{"text":"I am giving this 5 stars because I couldn't find a flaw with my visit.  I started with a glass of Jim Beam Devils Cut on the rocks (+1 for the single large ice cube).  

For our appetizer, we had the cornbread which was very uniquely presented in a cast iron skillet.  The orange marmalade was a great touch.

My entree was the Kentuckyaki Burger... I love pineapples pretty much on everything so I loved this.  Was cooked medium like I asked.  The sweet potato croquettes on the side were very good as well.  My fiancee had the Low Country Fried Chicken and really liked it.

For dessert, we split a pumpkin spice cup cake which finished off the meal perfectly.  

Prices are not too bad here and the atmosphere is very warm and modern.  Also the restrooms were very clean, which I think is one of the most overlooked places in a restaurant.  So I would definately recommend this place."}
{"text":"One word describes our early dinner experience. Yum! Add great service from Adam, and it was a very pleasant event. Started with a mint Julep ( it was Happy Hour after a tough day at work!) and I must warn that these are potent and authentic. That corn bread is the perfect accompaniment! Almost a spoon bread in texture and just delicious. We had onion rings (light, crispy coating on real rings), potato croquettes, root beer wings and the Kentuckyaki burger with the apple pie for dessert. Everything was on point! Not a single complaint, except I was stuffed. The layout of the place in an L shape makes it possible to sit far from the bar or right in the middle of the action, depending on your preference. All the hard surfaces make it pretty loud wherever you sit. So it's not a spot for a romantic evening, but it's fun, bright and bustling with activity and it has great food. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Apple (pie) of my eye!  

I went here on a Saturday for a late lunch.  Not packed at all.  The decor is a little lack-luster.  Uncomfortable chairs and straight banquettes.  But if you ignore that, this place is simply awesome. 

I had the best Manhattan that my palate has ever encountered: Four Roses Single Barrel, Sweet vermouth, Luxardo, Cherry Heering, Orange bitters.  (Why pray-tell has no one ever alerted me until recently about the awesomeness that is a luxardo cherry?  I want to marry it.)  

And the burger, oh my GOD, the burger!  I had the burger with portobello mushroom, caramelized onions, gruyere cheese, and some sort of delicious aioli.   I ate the entire thing all at once.  And it was huge.  It came with a choice of sides.  I had the salad. (I figured I had *better* get a salad to go with all of the rest of this gluttonous feast.)  Salad was simple, yet good.  I enjoyed the citrus vinaigrette.  

Then it wouldn't be right to not get a slice of apple pie.  I got it to go.  It had a bourbon caramel sauce accompanying it.  The apple pie was good, but not epic, like the burger and the Manhattan.  I actually wanted to order the peanut butter pie listed on their menu, but I was informed that they actually don't have that.  

Service was great.  My server was very attentive (almost TOO attentive), but he was nice.  

So, 5 thumbs up!  Next time I come back, I may be married to the Luxardo cherry in my Manhattan.  Laurie Luxardo.  Has a nice ring, no?"}
{"text":"It was really great that while we waited for our table on a busy Saturday there were seats at the bar. So we got a drink and waiting didn't seem so bad. Both of us got burgers and they were good but not amazing. I definitely recommend getting the croquettes. I don't think I have ever had anything like them before and they were so crispy on the outside and like mashed potatoes on the inside."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Pizzeria salad and hot chocolate chip cookie were awesome!"}
{"text":"This place had the right elements, but just didn't come together for me. The menu was creative, the service was great, but there were more misses than hits. 

First, the prices are way too high for what you get. Tiny piece of pie, tiny little wings, tiny little beers and pricey wines. Everything was good, but you can get better other places for less. And don't waste your money on upgrading your fries to the Rosemary and garlic. I love this treatment of Fries, but my order was cold, garlic burnt, and it seemed like they were just tossed in the dish together as an afterthought. (Stampers in FP does it way better)

I got the shrimp burger and it was interesting, everyone else got burgers and although my bun was great, their burgers were greasy and made the lower half mush. Everyone liked their burgers though and said they were cooked and seasoned well. 

Finally, there is only one bathroom for girls and one for boys. I don't get that. It's a big restaurant, like really big. What kind of architect plans that? I reject that totally.

I probably won't be back as long as there are places like Stampers, 56West, Deweys, etc still open"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff and excellent food. Will need multiple visits to try everything on the menu. Raging root beer BBQ wings are a must."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. I had a ground chicken burger with there battered onion rings which were great. My gf had the e&e burger... This burger was pretty darn tasty. The kitchen seemed kind of slow... But other than that I was pretty impressed with just about everything else."}
{"text":"Great burgers and beer. Didnt try the bourbon or apple pie. Food was a little expensive but if you only go once and a while its worth it."}
{"text":"We have now eaten here a number of times and I keep waiting for an inconsistency to pop up and it just hasn't. Food is always fast, very hot and sooo yummy. I am totally impressed with their burger. It might be moving in to my top five. We have also done carry out and it's amazing how fast and hot it is even on a Friday night. Good stuff guys! The balsamic blue burger is delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch during the workweek. I was immediately impressed by the casual feel of the place and the wide and tempting menu selections. I had the chicken burger italiano with onion rings on the side. Both were delicious and I felt a comparatively good value for the quality of food served. I would definitely go back to try  the other burgers."}
{"text":"Lately we've been experiencing a bit of a sophomore slump when it comes to our restaurant choices. It just seems that after a great first visit our return trips just fail to excite. I am happy to report that the slump has been broken with Eddie 'N Eddie. 

*queue angelic choir and radiant beams of light*

We headed back to Eddie 'N Eddie on a Wednesday around 6:30pm for our second visit. After having a fantastic first experience (and still the best pot pie I've ever eaten) we, of course, were expecting to be let down. Boy, were we wrong.

First, I've gotta compliment the staff on a really festive atmosphere. Christmas was in full bloom and it made our visit all the more exciting. Colorful bulbs, lights, and window decorations abound. The only thing missing was the blowing snow outside which, I'm sure, will be here soon enough. 

We walked into the restaurant much later than our typical early bird dining style so I half-expected it to be crowded. It was not. We were immediately greeted and seated. Nice, a booth all to ourselves. As Doug Heffernan once said, \"Tables are great but a booth is like a vacation for your ass.\" Our server smiled, welcomed us back and took our drink order. A quick glance through the short but sweet draught beer list and I settled on the Brekenridge Christmas ale. The wife opted for a clear winner, Great Lakes Edmond Fitzgerald porter. Both were fantastic foils for the chill in the air.

I came in expecting to get the pot pie but with a back-up plan just in case. Luckily, I was prepared. Since they were still serving the chicken version (this time with a red wine sauce) I decided to try something different. Here's the rundown:

Low-country Fried Chicken:
I rarely order fried chicken out. Not that I don't like it, it's just that most places don't get it right. Eddie 'N Eddie got it right. This aint your mommas fried chicken. Don't expect a basket with some thighs and drumsticks, this is fried chicken classy style. A wonderfully tender and juicy breast of chicken fried a delicious crispy golden brown lightly drizzled with a bourbon (of course) truffle honey. Yeah, I know. The breading added a slightly spicy crunch and the honey...who knew? Oh, and the pan dripping gravy that was artfully placed beneath the chicken was brilliant. I can't say enough about how good this was. Order it or you'll hate yourself forever.

As for my sides, the honey sage potato croquettes were just as good as last time but I should have gone without the mixed salad. While the salad was fresh it wasn't anything to write home about - field greens, tomato, a bunch of red onion, cuke slices dressed with vinaigrette. Meh. The chicken was so good I pretty much forgot about this slight misstep.

London Burger with Onion Rings:
*First, the burger mix they use here is stellar. Ground fresh by local meat artists Blue Ribbon Meats, it's a combination of short rib, brisket and chuck.*
This burger is a new addition to the menu and it's a good one. Served on a soft white bun, the meat is topped with two strips of bacon, cheddar cheese and mustard aioli. The star of this burger was the burger...as it should be. The meat was cooked medium well, as ordered, and it was juicy, flavorful and actually seasoned. The bacon was crispy and the mustard aioli was a solid supporting role. I wasn't a huge fan of the white bun as I found it a bit dense, but this is a minor criticism. The o-rings were tasty if a bit on the oily side.

Gingerbread Cupcake
Yeah, we actually made it to dessert. We asked our server to \"surprise us\" with her choice of cupcake and she went with the seasonally-appropriate gingerbread. It came topped with a vanilla buttercream frosting sprinkled with red and green sugar. While it wasn't the best cupcake I've ever tasted (Campbell's still has my heart) it was still yummy and the perfect ending to yet another wonderful meal.

As you can tell, we weren't disappointed. Great service, great food and great atmosphere. Maybe our next visit will get them that pesky fifth star...stay tuned."}
{"text":"Excellent food at reasonable prices!! Went to Eddie 'N Eddie's last night for dinner with a couple of friends. We made it there early enough (before 7 PM) to get the happy hour prices ($1.50 off a glass of beer or wine) and also beat the rush and we were seated right away. 

The waitress was very nice and accomodating as we had a certain food allergy to contend with and she made the extra effort to check with the chef on each dish we were interested in and let us know exactly which would be fine and which would contain the potential allergen. The salad was very fresh as well as the accompanying roll. I had the \"pizzeria\"  salad and it had just the right blend of cran-raisins, sunflower seeds and goat cheese - very tasty. 

For the main course I had the Honey-Bourbon Salmon and it was grilled to perfection. The glaze was actually very mild and I can't say I tasted much honey or bourbon, but I'd much rather have that then a glaze or sauce that is overpowering. The toasted pecan wild rice side dish was excellent! I glanced over at the table next to me and saw one of the Burgers and also the Lobster Mac and cheese and they both looked very appetizing.

The ambience is very casual, which was perfect for us, although the acoustics  made the background noise level a little higher than usual but certainly not annoying or intrusive and we were able to carry-on a normal conversation. The prices were extremely reasonable and all-in-all, Eddie 'N Eddie's is a winner!"}
{"text":"Split the e'n'e burger and the blue burger with the hubby. Both were phenomenal! Fries with the herb aoli were a great addition. We added a side of bourbon baked beans- great! They had tons of flavor and a nice kick. Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and things were quite a bit smoother.  Had their half burger/full side lunch special, and the chicken burger was excellent.  Service has gotten more consistent, too.  I'm so glad I gave them another try."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite last Friday 7pm- ended up grabbing 2 bar seats, and Breckenridge Xmas beer.  Didn't want to wait for a table (15 mins). The bar area fill sup quick.  The bartenders were very attentive and nice.  We ordered the burger w/ croquettes and the fried chicken w/ fried and cole slaw.  ALL in all happy- too full to get the apple pie so we will return to try."}
{"text":"They have all kinds of great choices for things to eat...anything from chicken pot pie to chicken parmesan to burgers to salads. Everything here is great. I had the Portobello melt with onion straws and roasted red peppers on a whole wheat bun. Sometimes there is too much bun, but this was the perfect portion.  The Portobello was cooked to perfection. Others in my group had a burger and they really enjoyed them as well. There are many side choices from your typical French fries to sweet potato croquettes. I highly recommend either the sweet potato or regular croquettes...they are yummy! Perfect portion size too. The service was great; our water glasses were never empty. There's lots of parking over in the Marc's parking lot which makes getting here more accessible."}
{"text":"I'm at a solid 3.5 right now, so I'll round up to 4 for the time being since I definitely see the potential.

We stopped by two Saturdays ago in the afternoon after catching an IMAX movie with the little guy.  There was a special menu for kids, I think, but he just wanted the wings. He ate most of them, so I don't think there were any complaints there. 

Now onto our food. My whole purpose in coming here? I really, really wanted to try the chicken pot pie everyone has been talking about and was slightly heartbroken to see they only serve them on certain days. I did see a soft pretzel with beer cheese that had my name all over it, though. I had also read about the low country fried chicken, so I tried that instead with a side salad and cup of their soup of the day. The soup tasted homemade, but it was just OK. The salad was so lightly dressed that it actually tasted like nothing was on it--and trust me, I don't like over-dressed salads. It was super fresh, though with nice, crispy romaine lettuce. Now, the soft pretzel loaves with beer cheese sauce were everything I wanted and more. Homemade soft and salty loaves of pretzels with a rich cheese sauce spiked with beer? How could that be wrong? The chicken--well, I'm going to get some slack for this but it really wasn't my thing. With that being said, I will say the dish was prepared very well with perfectly tender and juicy chicken, lightly battered and glazed with bourbon glaze. What I didn't like was just how sweet it was, but that's just me. 

Prices were a little steep, but I figure that has something to do with the freshness and quality of the food. I'll definitely be back to try that darn pot pie, too!"}
{"text":"I will go back. It took awhile to get seated, and we saw a number of open tables. I assumed it was for reservations, but i was told they only take reservations for groups of 7 or more, so i was unsure as to why all the open 4 tops, but whatev. We were told to expect a 45 minute wait for a table but it took about 20. Unfortunatly, we were seated at the awkward table by the door which gets a lot of draft, but the company was good so i over looked it.
We got the fried pickles an pastrami, which i somehow assumed was a deep fried bite with a pickle and pastrami included, like a deep fried one bite miracle, but it was not. It was fried pickles with slices of pastrami on the side, like an afterthought. Not sure if i would order again. Perhaps if i can get just the pickles.... 
Also, our appetizers orders were taken & delivered quick, but the server didn't come back for our main course order until well after the appetizer was cleared...the timing was a bit off, but i will chalk this up to this being a new place and working out the kinks.
I got a burger, my mom got the chicken & my sister got the ravioli. I will be ordering the chicken next time i go, as it rocked, but be sure to ask for extra gravy. My sisters raviloi was good as well & from Ohio City Pasta!! My burger was fine, but i have had better. I have also had worse. Also, the rootbeer BBQ sauce rocked. I asked for a side to try & they not only brough t me that, but all the sauces to sample, along with some fries so i had something to try it on.
So overall, it is good, but not cheap. The service can use come work, but they are friendly & eager to please. Do yourself a favor and order the chicken. If you get that & an appetizer, you and your friend can share & leave full!"}
{"text":"Oh Eddie.. 

It was a dark and stormy night. Seeking refuge from the hurricane, we ventured to Eddie 'N Eddie for the first time. When we arrived, I noticed the place had an overly forced rustic look, like trying a little too hard. there was a 20-25 minute wait, no biggie. (Though we did notice that they seemed to be slow at filling tables that were empty, even with quite a few people waiting to be seated.)

When we were seated, we were informed that due to the storm, they could not take credit card payments, but could direct us to the nearest ATM, or copy our card info down to charge us later. Why the heck didn't the hostess tell us that when we walked in? We would have used the wait time to go to the ATM!  Luckily, we had enough cash on hand between the 3 of us!)

We got water right away, but had to wait for a while to get offered anything else to drink, and then waited again to put in our food order.

The food, when it finally arrived was great. I had the fried chicken, potato croquettes, and baked beans, all done perfectly. I also sampled the Jambalaya, (more like gumbo really, but tasty!) and  Brussels sprouts - could have used seasoning, but good. (These my friend got substituted without notice when the veggie of the day was sold out, though they were nice enough to replace it when she said she didn't want that as the replacement.) 

After another long wait, our server finally came back to clear our plates and bring take home boxes. And after another wait, she asked about dessert.

The apple pie was great. (Loved the dried cranberries added in!)

Overall, the food was worth a trip in for take out, but I certainly won't be going back again."}
{"text":"New food & drinks spot in Lakewood that is totally worth checking out!  The beer selection is decent and the locally crafted APOC tables and bar are a nice touch.  The shrimp burger was amazing and the fried pickles yummy with a good crunch.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Our appetizer was the deep fried pickles and pastrami. It was really good. I had the special of the day which was City Chicken. It was just how my mom made it when I was a kid. Absolutely delicious. My wife had the Balsamic Bleu Burger. I had a bite and could see why she was inhaling it. It was way better than any burger we have ever had at B-spot. We will definitely be back to sample more. Monday and Wednesdays they have pot pies. Can't wait to get one of those."}
{"text":"It's good, but for the price I expected it to be great. Ended up sitting at the bar when we came in, which was ok. Service was good, liked the decor, the ambiance was a bit \"too good for the average joe to eat there\" upscale. 

Food was good, but again not great. At $13, the E 'n E Burger was a good portion, but something tasted off with the beef, as if they had forgotten to season it (kind of that hollow beef taste with no salt or pepper), the aioli that was on it was weak. My wife had the (good not great) $4 cup of soup and $7 (for a half mind you) beet salad. Adding on 2 neat pours of bourbon, and we were hitting $20 a person.

The bourbon namesake in their title is an ok part of their bar selection. I only opted for bourbon because I wasn't impressed by their tap selection, which was a limited 8-10 taps. With a World of Beer about to open next door, they're not winning anyone over for beer. Their bourbon selection I thought was a little disappointing. I expected to find a massive stash of hard to find specialty bourbons, but was greeted by a list of standard \"off-the-liquor-store-shelf\" selection. 

After realizing the mounting bill, decided not to opt for dessert, which was not even priced on their menu."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service was not good. The place was dead and it took forever to get our drinks, food, second drinks and bill. The girl that was our server never asked if we wanted water with our food. She wasn't around enough for us to ask her and her attitude was bad."}
{"text":"We went for dinner last night and it was not a very positive experience. We were seated right away but it took nearly 10 minutes for us to even get waters - which the hostess had to bring us, and then took an additional 5 minutes for our actual waiter to come over, who really only took our orders and filled our waters. The food and check were brought to us by two different people. This could be considered good service - but it came off more as disorganized and like they were rushing to get us out. The food was okay - I had the cheeseburger with sweet potato croquettes and my friend had the lettuce wraps. The burgers are overpriced ($10.50 for a cheeseburger? $9 for a regular burger? Up to $15 for a bacon cheeseburger?) and I could have gotten that burger at other places for a lower price. Overall - not impressed and don't think I will be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant! Excellent service! Really good food! Apple pie is pretty darn impressive and a great bourbon selection. It is a little pricey for me to say its a 5 star place. You pay for the experience but it is very fair trade."}
{"text":"I finally went here on a Monday evening. It was the perfect time to try it because we could actually get a table. We were seated right away, and had Adam as our server. He was great! He always made sure we had everything we needed and told us exactly what we needed to know being a newbie. 

We ordered the cornbread for an appetizer, and it was delicious! It was the perfect amount for a couple of people to split. For my meal, I ordered the regular cheese burger, and it was pretty good. I think next time I will try a specialty burger. My boyfriend ordered the chicken pot pie and he said it was fantastic! After all of this food, we did not have room for dessert but I would love to go back and try the apple pie. We also both ordered the Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale, which was delicious! I am not a huge bourbon fan, but I love the Bourbon Barrel Ale. Also, happy hour is until 7, which is amazing!! We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend Says:
Liked the decor, the burger was average, but he got the plainest burger. The rootbeer wings and croquettes were great, and the menu was interesting, and he wants to try many more menu items. 

I Say:
The decor was fine, a little chainey (my antichrist), and the bar section was definitely the coolest part of the design. The menu was definitely interesting sounding. I loved the fig (and something) salad, it was seriously great, but my plain burger was also just average. The waitress was very sweet. I get that this is a burger joint, but now that I've tried the burgers, I kinda wanna go back and try everything I missed out on the first time (rootbeer ribs, bourbon glazed whatnots, and PIE). In fact, we might just be back for the pie."}
{"text":"Stopped in after 9 pm the other night and had a great meal.  The service was great even though it was late and the interior was nice.  The E and E burger was amazing.  The portabella mushrooms and onions were just great.     The burger meat was excellent and was packed just tight enough that it didn't fall apart. The bun was excellent as well.  I had the sweet potato croquettes as a side and those were fantastic.  They were sweet on the outside with a great texture and I normally don't like sweet potatoes. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"I'm probably going to get a bit of flack for this but, so far this place is just ok. The food is decent, but a bit overpriced. The lunch was nice but I left dinner feeling unimpressed. I'll go back if someone asks me, but otherwise I feel like there are much better options in this area, with better prices."}
{"text":"First time here and I liked this place.  The beer selection isn't quite as good as Deagans but I personally thought the food value was better.  The bar is a bit small so if you're by yourself just chilling then I'd hit Deagans instead...We got the fried pickles which were really good - still firm when you bit into them.  I got the shrimp patty burger - was a bit hesitant because I don't eat any of that farmed thai drug concoction shrimp but the server said their shrimp here is organic from the gulf.  Burger came with a avacado/guac sauce.  We'll be back to try some other items."}
{"text":"We've been to Eddie N Eddie twice now, and have been impressed. The first time, we went for dinner, and the second was to meet friends for dessert & drinks. I had the fried chicken, which was terrific - a close second to Market Garden's fried chicken. The sweet glaze on the chicken went perfectly with the breading. My girlfriend had the ground chicken \"pepper pollo burger\" and she was very happy with it. The parmesan cheese + aioli was a great combination with the chicken. 

When we met up for dessert and drinks, the pecan pie stole the show. Best pecan pie we've ever eaten. Their logo should say \"Burgers - Bourbon - Pecan Pie\" and not apple pie. And the accompanying vanilla bean ice cream was delicious. 

Now, the drinks. I am a huge bourbon fan, and I love the full-page bourbon menu (as well as the rest of the drink menu). There's something for all budgets on there. However, I was not aware that there is a $2 upcharge for rocks. Really? This is Lakewood, not New York. It was later explained to me as a charge for a larger pour, but I didn't catch any fine print in the drink menu explaining the situation, and as a result my $7 Basil Hayden became $9 just because I asked for an ice cube. I'm not aware of any other bar in Cleveland that does this, but who knows. It's only a couple bucks and you get a nice XL ice cube that melts slowly, so it's not a dealbreaker or anything. 

That said, we'll be back. My friends raved about the burgers and sweet potato croquettes, and I definitely want to try the pickle & pastrami appetizer. And the chicken pot pie specials sound amazing."}
{"text":"Apparently 4th time is a charm. After trying to come here 3 times and it being closed all 3 times I finally got it. 

With a very modern day restaurant look, Eddie N' Eddie boasts an open kitchen with welcoming staff. Food was served super fast and made to order just the way I imagined when reading the menu. 

Fried pickles, not bad. Pastrami and spring mix with 1000 island awesome. 

Kentuckyaki Burger? Amazing. Teriyaki sauce, a pineapple slice, and bacon on a toasted bun.

Definitely can't be here every week, a little pricey, BUT must say worth the money.

{"text":"I will go ahead and echo everyone else with... best Manhattan in town!  Definitely give it a try if you are a Manhattan or a bourbon fan.

The first time we visited, we only had drinks and dessert.  Drinks are great! Aside from the A+ Manhattan, they really have quite a few innovative and classic cocktails.  We were pretty impressed with their drink list.  The bourbon and whiskey list left a bit to be desired, but I do understand the limitations with Ohio's arcane liquor laws.

On our second visit, we actually had dinner.  I went with the shrimp burger.  So good!  What a fun play on a boring burger!  Definitely recommend this for anyone who likes shrimp.  All the food coming out of the kitchen looked so good and all the tables looked happy and enthusiastic about their food.  The place had a happy and joyful vibe!  What a fun place to spend a Saturday night.  

They had around a half hour wait the night we visited (it was around 8:00) so plan accordingly.. But it was so worth it."}
{"text":"Had heard lots of good things about this place and finally had a chance to try it.  Love everything about the place.  Nice assortment of drinks/beer to choose from along with a good menu.  Tried the E & E Burger that was off the charts good.  No doubt this place is worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I was not too excited to hear Lakewood has a new burger joint. There are already a couple decent ones (Beer Engine, Jammy Buggars) and I thought this may flood the market. I was wrong. My mother and I came here after the Spooky Pooch Parade. We each had a burger. She had some sort of mushroom one, I had bleu cheese and avocado. They use a good mix of beef and the burgers are wonderful. The salads and soups are also good. Eddie 'N Eddie's is a welcome addition to Detroit Ave. It pains me to say, I am glad Melt took over the White Door. It serves as an anchor to this neighborhood and raised the bar for dining out in Lakewood. When I was about 12, I wouldn't eat hamburgers unless it was meat and bun only. Burger King screwed up my order. My friend opened up the door to The White Door Saloon and I threw the burger at the hillbillies in the bar drinking. They chased me on foot while I was on bike. It was one of the most intense moments of my life. I kept peddling while looking back and he almost got me. He was swinging his arms wildly and yelling at me."}
{"text":"I tried this place out for lunch. I ordered the E' n E' burger (mushrooms, onions, cheese) sans bun. I added a fried egg and avocado slices both for $1.50 extra each. The 4 avocado slices I got were not worth $1.50. The burger however was very good and very large! The restaurant accommodates special requests. The side salad as a side option (also $1.50 extra) was great with a red wine vinaigrette dressing.  Friendly, efficient, non-obtrusive service. Cool and rather large environment. This is a place where you can definitely eat as unhealthy as you could possible want, but with a little work a decent meal can be obtained."}
{"text":"I have not had Eddie Cerino's yet, but I had a pleasant experience at Ed and Eddie's. My burger was very flavorful and my side portions were above most. I washed down the burger I inhaled with a Blue Moon, it was smooth as usual. 

I am excited to try the new restaurant, I assume it's the same owners, due to carrying the name Eddie, lol. I hope the Italian place blows this out of the water because that will be some good eating!!!"}
{"text":"Whoa, talk about crowded! I was really digging the inside of this place. And, when you have \"Bourbon\" written in your name? Score! The service was good. We did have a long wait though... on a Saturday night during late dinner time - probably about an hour. But... I like seeing newer, busy restaurants along this strip in Lakewood, so I gladly waited. 

While waiting, I made my way over to the bar and ordered the boy an Old Fashioned and a Manhattan for myself. He asked me if I wanted my Manhattan 'up\" or \"on the rocks\". Umm... since when are Manhattans EVER on the rocks? I got a little concerned - BUT, he made it perfectly, even despite this snafu. 

We started dinner with the pretzel bread and beer cheese. Wow! I mean - I suppose it wasn't anything super creative... but the cheese sauce was so delicious! We both got burgers... mine of the bleu cheese variety. They were both done perfectly. All of the burgers were BSpot/Nano Brew style. That seems to be the \"thing\" anymore - upscale, fancy burgers. And, this girl is not complaining! 

I wish I saved room for Apple Pie... I did the Burgers & Bourbon.... maybe next time.

Overall, I was really impressed with this place. They even used local companies to outfit the place with furniture. Major score. Check it out."}
{"text":"Steak burger, sweet potato croquettes, pecan pie. Everything was very good to great. A piece of Cleveland used throughout the restaurant.  Which is recycled wood claimed from old Cleveland buildings. Very cool and i was impressed  with the choice of decor. Eddie has a good rep around this town. The vibe here is classy yet casual. I would come back again to this place to try other items in the menu. Service was excellent also."}
