{"text":"Pricing seems standard for Chinatown:

Monday - Friday* 9pm - 4pm (*Except holidays)
Dim Sum Special $2.00/dish

Monday - Friday: 4pm - close
Saturday - Sunday & Holiday
(S) $2.38 (M) $3.28 (L) $3.68

Overall:
The dishes were all as expected. Nothing too greasy or too dry. Went on a weeknight and it was mostly empty. They charge for tea but it's fine given the price of the dishes."}
{"text":"solid place for dim sum. price is $2.80 per dish if you go M-F to 4pm. food arrives piping hot. big servings. we ordered har gow, chive har gow, sticky rice, shrimp rice roll, 5 spce tendon, king oyster pea shoot rice roll, fried calamari. all ok. they also have free wifi."}
{"text":"Service is horrible, the food was mediocre, would not recommend. First off, tea costs like 80cents per CUP, and if you're in a table of more than one they will charge tea for everyone at that table despite them not even getting any tea. Servers are rude and aggressive, if you are ordering take away to eat at home ask for separate bills because they will charge it to your sit in meal and refuse to switch it adding to the tip they receive. Overall not that great, like many restaurants around the downtown area they act like they got a stick up their ass and serving you is a hassle."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and simple. I went here for dim sum around noon for thanksgiving and: 
* The food was very mediocre. It wasn't absolutely awful, but it wasn't great either. Most dishes were definitely misses while few were hits. Their siu mai was very juicy and was quite tasty, but their har gao was \"just okay\". I especially enjoyed the pan fried shrimp and chive dumplings. Most of the other things were ordered were edible, but weren't really good enough for you to really want to continue eating them. 
* The atmosphere was hectic. I appreciated the way the place was decorated, however, the \"clean, classy, and modern\" look they were going for did not mesh well with the vibe of the restaurant which was busy, unpleasantly loud, and very \"typical Chinese restaurant\". They could have at least had some subtle jazz music playing in the background.
* The service was 4/10 stars. The lady serving my table was busy running around and helping other tables when she hollered over to us to ask which tea we wanted. It took a while for her to come back with our tea pot, menu, and extra plate, cup and chopsticks. When she came by to drop off our order sheet/menu, she did not hand it to us, but rather threw it on the table. I didn't appreciate that very much. 

I rate my overall experience at Rosewood a 5.5 - 6/10. I left the place feeling pretty dissatisfied."}
{"text":"REALLY REALLY DISGUSTING!!! The meat are not fresh and very questionable. The congees are sour which feel like it was from last night. Overall are just really really bad. This is the worst place I have ever been to. As a Chinese person who live in China for the past 20 years of my life, their food is not acceptable. If you are looking for really Chinese food then never ever go into this place."}
{"text":"Popped in after running a few errands on the area for lunch on a Saturday and the place was packed.

We ordered the steamed pork buns, shrimp dumplings, sticky rice, beef dumplings and spring rolls. Tons of food for 3 people and very good. All fresh and flavourful. 

The picture menu was a big help when deciding what to order."}
{"text":"You gonna love this place.  Delicious good and generous portion at a VERY reasonable price."}
{"text":"Our group meets monthly for dim sum. This place was recommended so we gave it a try. Very disappointing. While the food was fine, it was the service and atmosphere that really put us off. Very, very noisy - lots of shouting around us and across the room. Service was slow and unattentive. We received food we didn't order, didn't receive food we did order. Our bill was a mess. 

The average quality of the food cannot make up for the unpleasant experience when there are TONS of other dim sum restos in downtown TO.

Visited: August 17, 2014"}
{"text":"The owner came by and told us they were primarily a dim sum restaurant and that we should come back during the day. He told us that some of the dim sum menu was available at night as well.

Customer service was excellent. Everyone was very friendly and came by often to make sure we were ok. We ordered a few dim sum items but the waitress told us it wasn't available at night. The manager came by after and confirmed it was available after all. We ended up getting a variety of dishes and everything was good or great. 

I loved the atmosphere and friendly staff and would come back just for that, but the food and price were big draws as well. I hope to come back during the day for dim sum to post a follow up review. Overall, I would recommend this place for dinner as well."}
{"text":"My partner and I read on Blogto that this was number #1 for dim sum and after working at Susur Lees dim dum restaurant Luckee which was ranked number #3 i was very curious to see what the hype was about.

When i got there i thought i had the wrong address but as i have learnt never judge a book by its cover so we proceeded to go in for some lunch. After sitting at the table for 20 minutes and no service even though they were just cleaning random tables i eventually had to call out in a very polite way in which i then received a death stare/eye roll like i had done something wrong?!

We eventually ordered and the food was good. But just good in my opinion. Rol San on Spadina is just as good, better service and like many other reviews on here they don't charge you for the tea!!

I most certainly will not be coming back here given the amount of great dim sum in the city which is just as affordable! Who ever said this place was number one needs a wake up call!!"}
{"text":"Everything was going medicore with the lack of service and all... until I found a fish scale in the lychee and gogi berry jelly. Thoroughly disgusted and forever scarred."}
{"text":"I think I consumed more oil here than the last time I had fries at McDonalds. 

Came for Dim Sum and the food here is oily more than anything. I wouldn't come here again. There is much better out there... you just have to head to Chinatown north (Markham)."}
{"text":"My family love this place! The food is great and the servers are quite nice! We're not Chinese but they know how much we love their culture and treat us like one of their own! Yeahhh! They usual give us tufofa on the house after our meals! The owner and managers are awesome and acknowledge their guest ! Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"Great lunch and service. We had the usual dim sum standards each one excellent taste and value."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE. My friends and I decided to eat here as a location for an afterparty for my friend who had her own art gallery. We chose this place because of the high ratings it had on yelp. Unfortunately we were not ready for such rude service and harassment. The server kept taking food and plates from our table even when we were not finished with it. She would throw food on top of each other and sometimes even on the table without apologizing or requesting to give us another plate. Some people don't like when food touch or are strictly vegetarian and they can't eat it at all. We like to keep meat and vegetables separate because of that but this server didn't understand even after we explained. She hit me and my friend on the head with her tray multiple times without apologizing. She stalked over our table as if the place wasn't crowded- which it was. And she was noticeably pissed when we asked for a new menu paper to order more food from. She wouldn't even refill our water or tea after asking several times. When it was time to pay they even decided to force us to tip such horrible service. And I mean a $4-$10 tip. This was a horrible eating experience and I will never recommend this place to anyone. I only wish I could give it a rating of 0 stars. Way to lose costumers..."}
{"text":"I frequent many places for dim sum in Chinatown and this place is my new favourite.  It's clean, modern, cheap and the food is fresh.  I keep bringing my friends to this place and everyone is pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"The dimsum was pretty good but ended up being there beside a table with two dudes who were the strangest co-diners I've ever dealt with. One guy was a drunk dwarf-like Asian guy who insisted on swearing and talking about conspiracy theories while the other guy was a taller white dude who didn't say a single word for the entire 45 minutes that my girlfriend and I were in the restaurant. Food was good but the entertainment was stellar. If you can go there while the dwarf Asian dude is there you'll have a stellar experience."}
{"text":"I saw the good reviews and gave a try on the Valentine's Day with my husband--such a horrible experience, it is the worst meal I've ever had in my life. I booked a table at lunch time for the dinner of two at 6:30pm since I was afraid we could not get a table on a Valentine's Day. When I entered the restaurant around 6:15pm in a Friday night (Feb 14, 2014), literally there were no one in the restaurants, except for a couple of waitresses (they were at least my mom's age). 

I picked a table at 2nd floor and my husband joined me later. We wanted the Dim Sum buffet for two... The \"grilled turnip cakes\" on the menu is \"Small\", but there were three big pieces of them and each was at least 5 inches wide... Come on, no one wants to go for buffet for such a big portion for each item, since we wanted to try more. But the \"Black Bean Spare Ribs\" is supposed be \"Medium\", which was such a small portion, like cat food! 

We ordered 8 items, such as \"Fried Dough Stick\" (again, it was at least the portion for four ppl and smelled like they were made a week ago), \"Braised chicken feet with house sauce\" and \"Five Spice Beef Tendor (terrible... smelled like not freshly made at all... it was like being steamed for a couple of days), \"Based BBQ pork buns\" (sold out)... 

We were not happy about the huge portion and terrible tastes... I asked the waitress before we ate anything whether the \"grilled turnip cakes\" and \"Fried Dough Stick\" could be less amount since we did want to try more items. After half an hour negotiation and begging, the answer was \"NO\", we had each item as a \"portion\", if we could not finish any item, we would be charged on the item left!!! 

We felt so terrible at a Friday night, plus Valentine's day and Lantern Festival... I told them I would pay by items instead of buffet, and just wanted to get out there asap and didn't want to stay for one more minute!!!! totally about $30 for two ppl for bunch of junk food (don't remember, about 8 items)

Not sure all the nice ratings! But I would never ever go back or recommend my friends!!! I had planned to invite my friends there for next Friday (Feb 21, 2014)... after this terrible experience I was so glad I tried out firstly, otherwise I would feel so terrible if I bring my friends to such a place!!! 

Honestly, if I could give \"0\", I would not give \"1\" score to them!!!"}
{"text":"Don't get the poor ratings for this place. We liked it a lot. It was a bit noisy but what dim sum restaurant isn't. I noticed the poor ratings were from 2012, if the service and the cleanliness were issue then, it isn't now. Great service for us and everything was piping hot. The tables and chairs were very clean as well. Something not typical of a dim sum restaurant. Best dim sum I've had so far!"}
{"text":"I must say I am surprised to find a dim sum restaurant in the heart of Chinatown with such modern interior. We were quickly seated upon arrival as the restaurant has 2 floors, although it does fill up very quickly during lunch hour. If you are dining alone, they will most likely put you in a big communal table with others that are also dining alone. 

They have an all day dim sum special for $2.50 every dish. Food arrives very quickly and most dishes are decent as they don't cheap out on the filling with exception of the BBQ rice roll and the sweet egg yolk bun. The service is also fairly decent for Chinese restaurant. My coworkers and I have already been here twice in the last 2 weeks and definitely will not be our last!"}
{"text":"the dim sums are literally the wastes to taste, kinda like something that are left for the whole week."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was terrible.  We sat upstairs and these two Asian ladies who did not speak any English served us.  They threw plates and cups on the table, never brought any sauce we asked for and forgot one of our orders even though it was checked off on one of their ordering forms.  

The man who greeted us at the door was very nice, wish he served us instead."}
{"text":"So me and my family stopped in for lunch the food was ok. This doesn't include my minced beef with an egg and rice not being fully cooked and pink almost all the way through which being it's like a hamburger is very not safe. But my biggest problem with this place though is the service was terrible. The ladies serving us seemed like they were yelling at us and annoyed. They brought us other people's food then tried to argue and say it was are food. But the biggest reason for the terrible rating was when it was time for the change they didn't bring us any, then told us it was a law that we had to tip 10 percent which is of course not true. Screw this place and save your money eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Rosewood was a great Dim Sum spot downtown when it first opened up a couple of months ago, but the quality and service of the restaurant has quickly declined. 

After my most recent visit I will not be returning. The food was brought to us just lukewarm, tea was tasteless and the waitress did not respond to our request for more tea leaves when refilling the pot. Also, the waitress started clearing the table without asking if we were done with our meal. Note that it was not busy at all on a weekday morning. While clearing the table she bumped into my teacup which i was taking a sip from and did not apologize even though it led to spilling tea on my clothes. Obviously this led to a smaller tip, and guess what? The waitresses have the guts to ask for more tip.

As a foodie, I frequent the area often and my advice is to STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Love coming to Toronto for Asian food and dim sum is one of them. We met up with some Texan friends and we both agreed that Rosewood was better than our respective cities.
Sticky rice was banananana leaf aromatic!
Chow mein sopped the booze from night before!
Turnip cake was turnt up!"}
{"text":"Its good in compassion to most dim sum joints in Chinatown. Service could use some work but other than that its pretty good. I've lived in Scarborough my whole life and been downtown for a few months, although dim sum downtown isn't as good at least rosewood (seems like they) tries."}
{"text":"Great food! The har gau and congee were excellent. Come here early if you don't want to wait up to an hour for a table! Ordering is via checklist, and you can specify what items you want served first."}
{"text":"The place was always packed. The foods were okay, the service was okay, and the prices were reasonable. This was a dim sum place. I did not expect super friendly staff. Even though they were busy, I did not wait for foods so long. Compared to other dim sum places, their foods were better."}
{"text":"Overall, this is the best dimsum restaurant in Chinatown. The taste is definitely from mainland Chinese and although it's not my favourite, it's quite good!  

We always order the usual hargow, siumai, shrimp rolls and squid tentacles. Their other steamed/fried/congee dishes such as shrimp and chives dumplings are tasty as well. Also, the tea is pretty good-try their chrysanthemum puerh tea! One thing that I haven't gotten used to is how their steamed items are slightly doughy and chewy. But, like I said, it's just a different taste and not necessarily a bad thing.

Service is quick, servers speak a plethora of Chinese dialects (and English-not to worry) and are friendly. Come here on a weekday to enjoy the discount and uncrowded spaces, otherwise head over bright and early on a weekend!"}
{"text":"There was basically no service. No one approach us to ask how we were doing. Some orders were mixed up, and they charged us for some of the dishes we didn't even order. The food was mediocre at best. The good ones were sushi dumplings. We weren't given a chance to order again. The tea took forever to be refilled, and we never asked for it to begin with -- especially had we known we would be charged for it.

I lost my ring in the washroom there at around 1030pm when we left, place closed a t 1 am (July 5/17). It was written with JRB and an anniversary. It isnt pricey, but was hoping someone would turn it in, it is very special especially the life story behind it (call/text: 6473931456). The place was super empty, us only being the customers, and it seemed the waitress were watching us hard as if telling us to leave so we were pretty much rushed.

Overall, alright food, ok service."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. They could be less chinsy on the stuff that goes in the congee but other than that I enjoy coming here because they have everything you want for dimsum (I'm talking deep fried taro balls with pork, tentacles done proper, chicken feet, all the shrimp, lotus leaf stuff, you name it)."}
{"text":"Food is lukewarm.   Waitresses don't understand what we asked, we have repeatedly asked many times, the restaurant was pretty empty, but they didn't remember what we asked.  I don't see any reason I will go there again!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you want some dirty Chinese.
There's no shortage of options at Dundas and Spadina.

We ended up at Rosewood for a UYE.

This place is new? Really? Because it looked old pretty fast.
The extremely bright lighting was uncomfortable and illuminated things that you don't need to see in a restaurant.

The floor was gross.
The chairs were SO gross.
Maybe they had been recently re-upholstered, but cream Microfiber full of crumbs with peoples hair stuck to it??? Ugh.

They refused to let us sit upstairs.  
I took a peek, the upstairs looked much nicer, instead of the downstairs area with like 3 tables where you feel everyone is just watching you eat and you're right in front of the door.

As for the dinner, the food was ok but really nothing spectacular.
The crispy skinned chicken was the best item we had.

With all the other places to eat around here, it's unlikely I'll ever return to Rosewood."}
{"text":"Pretty good dim sum place!

Not like the traditional dim sum places with the carts, but still nice to just order off a list! Food was good, ordered lots and loved them all.

They also have free WiFi!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at Rosewood with friends. We had reservations and we were seated quickly on a Saturday night. We ordered several dishes but the stand outs were the shrimp and chive dumplings (better than the har gow, in my opinion), and the chicken ginger and coriander buns. It was a little loud but there were a couple of large parties there that night. I'm definitely coming back to try the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Modern cutlery and open-concept design doesn't save this less than mediocre dim sum restaurant.

Rosewood Chinese Cuisine is the newest dim sum restaurant in the Spadina-Chinatown area and unfortunately they don't improve on what already works.  I took my mother and sister for a late morning meal, and the restaurant was half full. So far so good!  The seating arrangement on the first floor is how a lot of modern Asian-fusion restaurants have their layout: one long bench along the wall with about 5 or 6 2-person tables running along the bench.  The upper floor has bistro style booths interspersed with 4-person seating and larger banquet style tables. We sat upstairs.

The server brought us a pot of tea that was lukewarm and already steeped.  The service was not great, with our server giving us and several tables the wrong dishes.   We ordered the staples of dim sum: har gow, siu mai, minced beef balls with bean curd stick, pineapple pork buns, rice flour rolls, egg tarts, vegetarian bean curd rolls, and deep fried taro dumplings.

Among the seven dishes, only the har gow and siu mai were hot.  The rice flour rolls were on the verge of going bad and tasted almost sour, and the minced beef balls were on a bed of onions instead of the traditional bean curd.  I have to give credit to the ingenious pineapple pork buns.  Combining the two is a stroke of brilliance.  The egg tarts were okay, the crust was flaky and light but the filling was cold and way too sweet. The taro dumplings were not worth mentioning.  All in all, the food didn't blow me away and the major deal-breaker was the freshness of the food.  

The most important thing about dim sum is the freshness and timing of each dish.  You want to sit down, relax, and enjoy each dish at a leisurely pace.  The server brought out all of our food at once, so by the time we worked on the last dish it was already cold. She also brought the eggtarts first, which is usually eaten last.  I feel like rosewood's concept and execution for dim sum is too scattered.  While it looks nice, clean, and modern, it doesn't deliver where it's most important: taste and service.

2016 Update:
So after avoiding this place for the last 4 years, I thought I'd give it another visit.  Hey, maybe it's gotten better after all this time, right?  Wrong!  If anything, the dishes are even more mediocre than before!  I went with my wife and 2 friends, and we ordered a good amount of food.  The biggest let down was their shrimp in rice roll (Ha Cheung).  The correct way to prepare this dish is to mince the shrimp into a fine paste, and season with garlic, salt, white pepper, then steam it in rice flour wrapper.  The way that Rosewood does it is .. they just throw three pieces of shrimp in the rice roll wrapper and call it a day.  
I lied, that wasn't the biggest let down.  The price was the biggest let down.
When we visited this restaurant 4 years ago, while mediocre, Rosewood could still boast very competitive prices and offered an early bird special for diners.  I was shocked to see that Rosewood prices their dishes around as much (if not more than) Rol San, which is head and shoulders above Rosewood in terms of quality and freshness.

So 4 years later, the food has stayed the same (if not gotten worse) and their prices have went up.  If you must have dim sum around Spadina and Dundas, I would recommend Sky Dragon if you're looking for the traditional cart service at an amazing price, or Rol San for quality and being a bit more non-Chinese friendly (items are listed in English and Chinese)."}
{"text":"Dim sum: Reasonably priced, above-average selection, average quality, slightly below-average service. No cart service as it's 2 stories but food arrived quick and hot. Best dish: shrimp & coriander steamed dumplings. A delicious twist on a classic!  Paid $45 for 2ppl with leftovers."}
{"text":"Review update: Years later and this place is still my go-to place for Dim Sum whenever I'm in Chinatown. I've tried dinner here too and the food was fairly good, no complaints. I think they hired some new staff but they are still friendly to me and the good service hasn't changed over the years. 

Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since its inception. They are constantly improving and became one of the finer chinese establishments . The quality of the dim sum is very good for Chinatown. I've been to all the old places Rol San, Sky dragon and Dim sum king. This place is my favourite. 

My recommendation for dim sum is 
Honey garlic ribs
Har Gow
Siu Mai
Crispy shrimp dumplings 
And to those brave enough the chicken feet.

Also on their dinner menu the e-fu noodles is so saucy and tasty. 

Service wise the servers speak multiple dialacts of chinese and  English. Service is standard for Asian restaurants. I go in these restaurants to enjoy the food and had no complaints."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for dim sum. The food was fresh, delicious and reasonably priced. The menu is not favorable for vegetarians, but there were enough options. The service was fairly quick still could have been friendly at times."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, tasting fresh but took a while to come, about 15 minuets. The bathrooms were super clean."}
{"text":"I love Dim Sum. Sort of relax with a pot of good tea. Rosewood seems nailed it with Jasmine and chrysanthemum tea. I love the dumpling in soup and variety of fresh quality dim sum in there. 
Only slightly disappointment is, this restaurant always full around 11 am to 1 pm. If one thinking of sneaking in to have a relax dim sum for lunch with limited time, then will become a luxurious..."}
{"text":"Quality is pretty good and there are a lot of variety but I find it pretty pricey for dim sum. I usually pay $15-20 on a non-ayce dimsum and I'm already super full and have leftovers to take home. This one ended up costing $28. Still prefer me my LHL or Fisherman Villa because of this."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious, service is very fast, and the prices are amazing. The only downside I can think of is I always get the one waitress who comes off really abrasive. She won't keep me from coming though. I love it here!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't tried this place sooner. Rosewood is right near Dundas/Spadina and serves all day dim sum. They even have all you can eat dim sum during the evening for less than $25 a person. I came here with moderate expectations and was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of their dim sum dishes! They have your standard dishes like har gao (shrimp dumplings) and siu mai (pork dumplings) but also offer more unique ones like stewed herbal soup with chicken feet - this is definitely one of my favourites on their menu. I would also recommend their custard buns which were so soft and chewy! Overall a good dim sum restaurant worth trying in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Coming from Pittsburgh, PA where there's no such thing as dim sum, I might have low standards. Regardless, the food was amazing and we now crave it every weekend morning. My husband and I traveled to Toronto and we made a point to stop for dim sum. Rosewood is clean, their servers are attentive and the food came out quick, warm and delicious. Between the two of us, we ordered a table-full. Our favorites were the roasted pork bun and shrimp dumplings. But all were good! One thing to note, they serve you tea and they also charge you for it. So if you don't want tea, make sure you let them know before they provide it to you. If only we lived closer, we'd be here every weekend!"}
{"text":"As much as I love dim sum on the carts, it's gets expensive and frustrating really quick. At Rosewood you order on the sheet and your food comes directly to you hot and fast. No waiting to see if the dish you want will roll around on a cart. 

Whenever I come here we always our basics: har gow, shu mai, ginger tripe, turnip cake, deep fried turnip balls, flat noodles, mango pudding, sticky rice with meat, and BBQ pork buns. It always end up being too much for 2 people but we always get the satisfaction of saving the left overs for later. This ends up being about 44$ or so, but still cheaper than the 27$/person AYCE option. 

The one thing to note that frustrates me is that many of the flat noodles do contain cilantro. Most of the options do state that it includes it, but the BBQ pork option does not say it. Be careful and look at the menu pictures if your avoiding the cilantro. In my experience the shrimp option is the best one without the cilantro. 

Do recommend if you need a quick dim sum in the dt area."}
{"text":"Having eaten at Rosewood a number of times, I have one recommendation to offer.
Go on a weekend.
Although dim sum is on offer 7 days a week, my experience is that the weekday fare is not as fresh as that offered on the weekend. 
Although weekends are busier, and it is a good idea to make a reservation, the quality of the dim sum is worth the effort. Previous excursions on weekdays were \"OK\", but often the dishes felt a little stale or rubbery, so we were pleasantly surprised at the difference going on a Saturday makes."}
{"text":"I came here because I craved Fukien food from childhood, so I'm unsure about the Canton-style dimsum and all that - but the dishes I did try (Fujian-style Ban Mian noodles, Ho Fun, Hokien wontons) were very authentic and commendable."}
{"text":"We came here for a UYE.
The place has an open and clean feel (a rarity in this neighborhood IMO). We had a set menu and had the following:
Lychee Pork. Hmm I tried this by mistake and to tell you the truth it could have been mystery meat for all I care. It was mostly batter anyway and devoid of any texture and taste. Could have come out of a frozen meal with the sauce just warmed up and slathered on.  
Grouper. This was served two ways. Once with soup and the other stir fried with veggies. Both attempts were bland. A delicate fish wasted. 
House Fried Vermicelli again a very poor dish. Just out right bland. 
Fried Mixed Vegetable Noodles . I am not a vegetarian by any means but this one was a better dish on what we tried.  Clean taste.
Tofu Bean Curd Stick and Eggplan. Standard fare here a very average dish.
Crispy Chicken This was supposed to be their signature stuff. Skin was crispy which is nice, though I did find the meat to be dry. OK I guess. 
Purple Rice Sweet Soup: Garbage.
I might come back to try this place for dim sum as the price is right and reviews seem decent otherwise from what I had for dinner I would stay away. 
The only saving grace for this place IMO is that its inexpensive but so is the Mcdonald a few steps away! 
1.5 stars."}
{"text":"This was a very nice dim sum place in Chinatown. We did not do the dim sum buffet so we picked which ones we wanted to try through the visually appealing menu that has pictures of all the dim sum items. I loved the deep fried milk and was happy they offered it since not a lot of dim sum places have it anymore. Other ones that I liked were deep fried squid and the runny custard buns. However, the taro cakes was really bland and had no flavour. Overall, I would come here again if I want to eat dim sum while in Chinatown."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh upon order. The dim sum is great because you get what you order, it's warm, fresh and don't have to wait for the food. If you are looking for the pushing cart for your dim sum, this place is not for you. There's all day and all you can eat dim sum. 
There's other food as well. The fried noodle, noodle soup, rice, meet/chicken dishes are also good."}
{"text":"This is probably now my favourite Dim Sum place in the downtown China town area. It's not leaps and bounds better than Dim Sum King so I still go there when I want the al-a-carte experience but when I just want good quality dim sum, Rosewood is my new first choice. 

I also have to add that this is the only place I have ever found that also has an all you can eat dim sum option in the evening. You should know that this is quite unique in the world of dim sum, at least as far as I know. It's their innovative way of filling the place in the evenings where dim sum is typically a morning/brunch meal. The quality is exactly the same as well as in the case of the all you can eat evening option, you are ordering the exact same dishes that you would order at normal price in the morning!

It really helps that the quality here is also one of the best downtown as well so if you find yourself having the normal brunch option or trying out their all you can eat evening option, you will definitely be happy to have visited Rosewood.

The only thing that has ever left me wondering was their choice of using strange coloured fluorescent lighting on their main floor dining area that makes the place feel office like. And just to get a bit obscure, the lighting also matched my experience when visiting old communist cantinas like I have during a visit to the Demilitarized Zone in Korea, or places I've been in Moscow and other east European countries."}
{"text":"I love the Rosewood's dim sum,and frequently visit for a quick bite to eat. Their steamed dumplings are the best along with the deep fried items.Only I ask the waitresses to stop asking for a tip especially when the service is not up to the par. otherwise, include the tip in the final bill because it is rude to ask for a tip like that."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch to celebrate Chinese New Year. If I could give this place a 3.5 star I would.

The place was busy, but luckily we didn't have to wait too long. They have both an upper and lower level floor. The food came out fast and was cooked well. They have a good selection of dishes. Most of the food is pretty inexpensive.

I really enjoyed ha gow (shrimp dumpling), the fried pork dumpling, turnip cake, cheong fan (rolled rice noodles) we ordered the ones filled with shrimp and BBQ pork, BBQ steam buns, and soup dumplings. There is almost an art to eating the soup dumpling, make sure that eat it in one bite, but be careful as it's very hot. I really enjoyed the friend octopus. It was lightly battered and not too oily. For $15 dollars each we were really full.

If you are looking for a new Dim Sum place, I recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Super cheap, super delicious, and super friendly. What else do you want in a restaurant? Recently they've gotten a lot better, the owner hangs around the restaurant and makes sure you get the best service. They have $2.20 dim sum weekdays, and all you can eat dim sum for $17.99 (which in my experience, is not quite worth it since I get super full on 3 dishes). I always get the tofu curd rolls with mushroom, super tasty!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Chinese restaurant in the Chinatown region and 3.5-4 in uptown standards. I'm giving it 5 stars because there isn't a restaurant in the area with the same quality and flavour. I really liked that their food wasn't overly salty,  greasy or strong in MSG. I'm reviewing based on their dinner. Their Peking duck was actually crispy, although the wrapper was a bit thick and tough. I particularly enjoyed their soup, which I usually pass at restaurants because of salt overload. Their lobster and steamed fish was also fresh. Even for their desserts, they don't skimp on the taro. We will definitely be returning for our next family event."}
{"text":"Very good dim sum at a very good price.   The soup dumplings were fantastic, super thin skin with soup in tact upon arrival.  Service a bit weak...4stars"}
{"text":"Great Dim Sum option in downtown Toronto. The restaurant is clean, and there are many options for dishes, and everything is made fresh."}
{"text":"This was my first dim sum experience and overall it was an enjoyable one! Although I don't have much to benchmark the experience against I thought the food was good but didn't overly impress me. Restaurant was quite large and loud - as expected for a dim sum restaurant especially at this price point. Price was reasonable with 5 items and tea coming to around $25. I'm not going to pretend I know exactly what I ate - my girlfriend ordered everything!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum. We were a table of 12 so we ordered a lot of different dishes to try. Came out to $13 each including tip.

Notable items: sui mai, har gao, beef tripe, fish slice congee. All of these were really really good, and stood out to me as being better than other dim sum places in the city. The buns and dumplings are good here too.

Wasn't a huge fan of: the turnip cake (not enough filling), meat in rice noodle (not enough filling), bbq pineapple pork bun (tasted like dough/flour - definitely wasn't in the oven long enough).

Regular bbq pork bun was just ok (the bread part was a bit mushy). The egg tarts were good, but maybe a tad too sweet for my liking.

Atmosphere was really nice, and deco was modern, spacious and comfortable. Overall, would recommend if you're looking for dim sum in downtown Toronto! Of course, if you want amazing dim sum, then Markham is the place to go."}
{"text":"3.5/5 Pleasantly surprised. Having had dimsum in Markham and Richmond Hill, DT Toronto has just never really cut it for me. I tried this place based on reviews and I quite liked their runny egg yolk bun and the classic hargao + siumai wasn't too bad either. The decor of the place was nothing special and the service was okay. There wasn't a lot of servers so there were times when you would have to just wait it out before you get noticed. Their rice noodles were oookaaayyy.. It's not one of the better ones I've tasted but its not too bad and the roll isn't too thick or thin. I will probably come back."}
{"text":"Rosewood is located in the heart of Chinatown. You do not come here expecting great service or amazing ambiance. The restaurant looks like a cafeteria. It is cleaner than many of the other restaurants in the neighbourhood.

The food is good. I have been to this restaurant many times for dim sum (and dinner) and the food is consistently good. The prices are very affordable. In fact, if you go during weekday, they have a lunch special ($3 per dish). The service is quick and efficient. Sometimes that's all you need."}
{"text":"Yay! A nice dim sum place in Chinatown!
A group of us decided to check out this new restaurant for Saturday dim sum and it was great! Clean and nicely decorated interior, the staff were very friendly and the food was fresh and delicious. There were lots of dim sum dishes to choose from. Unlike many dim sum places, there were lots of fresh & inexpensive veggie options to choose from. We paid roughly $11 per person and there was a lot of food!
Apparently there is free wi-fi, also, but I didn't use it..."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 for his place!

I've never been to an AYCE dim sum place so this was a nice surprise. I came here with a large party for dinner and we were pleased with the variety. Menu has pictures so it made ordering a lot easier.

My fav included the congee, dough stick, fried milk, mango pudding, short ribs and cheung fun. I was actually very pleased at how authentic everything tasted although some things were a bit too oily (fried items mostly). The food came pretty fast and hot, and we were pretty stuffed afterwards. 

The waitresses were nice but they don't really speak English, so I recommend coming with someone that can speak Mandarin otherwise it's hard to communicate. The place could've been a bit cleaner but hey, it's a Chinese restaurant... 

Overall it is a solid dim sum place and I would go back."}
{"text":"We took advantage of early bird special $1.88 before noon, what a bargain! Great serving size and food is made fresh to order. We were quite impressed. 
We ordered about 22 dishes to share, everything was great except the eggplant stuffed with shrimp paste.
Finally, a great dim sum place in downtown Toronto!
Would definately go back soon :))"}
{"text":"If you enjoy Dim Sum at very affordable prices Rosewood can't be beat. With over 100 dishes to choose from, such as egg tarts, steamed milk pudding, har gow, chicken's feet, congee, noodle and rice dishes, there is no shortage of options. 

If you love dim sum, this is the only place to serve All-You-Can-Eat Dim Sum in CHinatown! For $15.99 you can order anything off their 2 page menu including rice and noodle dishes, along with desserts and everything in between. With a ridiculous value like that, it's difficult to pass up given that you aren't sacrificing quality with quantity. 

With a group of 30, they were very accommodating. With ample space, presentation room, karaoke room, wireless speaker system and 2 floors, it's a good option for larger groups and parties.

The atmosphere is also welcoming and modern. Presentation is nice and most importantly, everything was clean and organized. The staff speaks English so it helps if you are a dim sum noob, to have someone explain a couple dishes to you. 

Overall, I really like Rosewood. The food is great, tasty and made to order. The service is fast and the prices are great! Compared to the other Dim Sum joints in the neighborhood the quality is spot on."}
{"text":"Very extensive selection of dim sum.  Everything tasted fresh and hot. Especially the dumplings! The rice paper rolls had lots of filling and whole shrimp. The owner was very engaging and funny! $2.50 per dish is an amazing price."}
{"text":"I still like the place though the price just keeps going up. It's now $3 all day Monday to Friday until 4pm.  I'm not happy the fried squid tentacles have been exempt from the special and they are now $6!
It's still cheaper than most places though. I did a price comparison to Rol San cause it's also order by menu but no sale and it's worth a go.  But if my kid wants extra har gow to take home, I'll order here afterwards lol"}
{"text":"The first time I came here with some coworkers a few months ago, I had only good things to say about it. So when my mother and sister said they were craving dim sum, it was the first place I thought of taking them. Unfortunately, we were so disappointed in the experience that I am definitely not going back. First, as other reviewers have mentioned, you are charged for tea without being told. Most dim sum places don't charge, and if they do, I am usually made aware. There were only about 3 or 4 other tables of customers while we were there. It was not busy at all, which is why having such rude service was surprising (Not that poor customer service is ever okay...) At first, things were not so bad. We opted for the All-You-Can-Eat dim sum option as it was only $18.99. I was excited. All I could think about were the Crispy Shrimp Wontons that I loved so much the first time I came here. We ordered a bunch of things and most of it came out at the same time, with a reasonable amount of wait-time. Everyone was pleased with the food initially - perhaps we were just so hungry that anything we ate in that moment would have been satisfying. However, the shrimp wontons I had been dreaming about since December, were not as good as I remembered. They were far too oily and ended up making me feel terrible. The shrimp rice rolls were 90% rice paper so I cut off the excess parts and placed it on a plate to discard. Once the server saw this, she made a comment in her language (which I obviously did not understand). It was rude and unnecessary. Awhile later, I asked another server for more napkins. She looked at me annoyed, scoffed, walked to get napkins and dropped them on my table. At this point we were just baffled at how rude the servers were. To top it all off, we watched the rude napkin server lady, stop a young couple who was leaving, point to their bill and say \"10%\" (insinuating that they were obligated to leave a 10% tip), the poor girl took out a toonie or two and gave it to the lady!!! Normally I leave a 20-25% tip for good service AND good food. 15% for good food and satisfactory service. 10% for satisfactory food/service and 0% if the service is terrible (regardless of If the food is disgusting or amazing). Food quality is important to me, but customer service is what truly makes the experience. I will not be coming back to this place. The food is not worth the way you are treated."}
{"text":"My go to place for dim sum.  You order from the menu instead of carts.  In the evening they have all you can eat dim sum.  The food comes out hot."}
{"text":"The worst dining experience I've ever had. DO NOT GO HERE!!! I have eaten in all over the world and this is the absolute worst. The chicken was not chicken and had a very questionable crunch. The \"beef\" with rice and egg was mushy and it was absolutely not beef. We questioned leaving numerous times. There was not a single redeeming dish. The servers were rude and never came to check on us and we had to hunt them down for water. I asked one of the servers what the dishes were and said she didn't know and that she guesses. We were forced to eat the food or pay more and it borderline a bad episode of Fear Factor. 

We left concerned for what we ate and very disappointed. 

Let my experience be your warning and DO NOT go here."}
{"text":"Dim sum on a weekday afternoon was fresh and delicious. It was very busy and we still had to wait even though we had made reservations. 

Food rating is easily 4 stars but I was not impressed with the service. We were seated in a private room and were forgotten. We waited 40 mins before reminding them again."}
{"text":"Randomly stopped in here on our walk around Chinatown for some Dim Sum, without any prior knowledge of the area or other offerings, and our group was pleasantly surprised! 

Food: There were a ton of options, but we settled on sweet and sour pork, house fried noodles, fried rice, a few spring rolls, and three servings of Xiaolongbao. All of it was quite tasty and was the perfect amount for six people (per the server's recommendation.) I will say the fried rice was some of the best I have had and my friend (who has spent ~6 mos in China) claims that the Xiaolongbao was better than any he had over there.

Service: While a little hard to figure out what was going on at times (normal confusion in a busy Chinese restaurant) the server was very attentive, and offered up some good suggestions for all of us.

Additional Thoughts: If you find yourself wandering around Chinatown looking for a casual lunch spot, this is a great choice. The price is very affordable (our whole group was less than $70 CAD) and it was a fun time before we hit Kensington Market."}
{"text":"Bad food quality and taste! one of the worst service and staff I met in Toronto. Stay away from this below average food experience and the sickness feeling after the food has digested. Plus it's a very noisy place (by the staff not the guests) which doesn't make this any better."}
{"text":"1 star for service, the waitress are courteous and attentive. another star for speed, it came out pretty fast.

Opted to this place cuz we are sick of the long wait at Rol San and Crown princess is too pricy. there is no wait. comparative better decor than Rol San. but the food...... sigh... it does not taste good at all.......... one of the worst dim sup i've had..... lots of cute white guys there (by themselves) tho.... i guess thats why. cuz every white guy in Rol San were brought by an Asian girl. lmaoooooo"}
{"text":"I went for dinner with two friends on Monday.  We decided not to order much the first time so that we didn't waste anything.  So when we finished, we asked for another order form.  The waitress looked at us and said, \"More???\"  We said yes and placed a second order, neither order was excessive.  People around us were receiving food but not us.  We asked the waitress whether our food was coming and she said no. We were shocked!  \"No?\" We asked.  \"You want more?\" she said and we said yes and filled out a third order form.  We were laughing uncontrollably by this point, not believing that she was so openly rude.  Oddly enough, an item from our second order arrived which we hadn't ordered on the third sheet.  We payed and left, marveling at the downright audacity of this waitress.  If they don't want to serve AYCE, then they shouldn't offer it, but being nasty to customers is just going to lead to bad reviews and people not going back.  The food was good but the one waitress made our experience less than enjoyable!"}
{"text":"There's a reason this is rated the top dim sum restaurant in downtown on BlogTO. Not quite high end, not quite a hole-in-the-wall typical Chinatown dim sum, but quality food! It's become a ritual for my ex-coworkers and myself to meet up here for lunch every once in a while. Oh man does this place get busy though! The most recent time we went, we went on a Sunday around lunch time and it was a 45-minute wait for a table of 3! To help save time, they ask you if you would be willing to share a table with another small party. We said no, but a lot of other people usually say yes.

When we finally got a table, we were waiting on our 3rd guest to arrive (yes, he was over 45 minutes late). The 2 of us got seated first and we decided to order for him because he said he was about 10-15 minutes away. When we gave our order sheet to one of the waitresses, she told us we should have continued to wait for a table since our friend didn't show up yet. It's true, but it was a little rude since we had waited our turn for a table. Anyways, our 3rd coworker finally showed up and we indulged in some delicious food! The owner came by a few times to either refill our tea or deliver the food, and he apologized for what the waitress said earlier. Such a sweet man! He made jokes, always made sure we were doing alright, and was always smiling.

Tea per person is $.80 and I would take advantage of the dim sum special if you can - $2.40 per dish on Monday-Friday between 9am and 4pm. They even have AYCE dim sum for dinner! I remember there being a minimum order of $20 if you wanted to pay a bill by debit, so either bring cash or put it all on 1 bill and split the difference later. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"We're regulars here...I think we've been coming every saturday for the last few months.

Hot and sour soup is one of the better ones in the city.
Dumplings are always fresh and hot.

It gets very busy on the weekend, usually after 12...11:30 seems to be the sweet spot to get a big table"}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of dim sum and was hopeful as the reviews seemed generally good.  I wouldn't classify myself as a picky eater as I only expect to be full and not get sick after eating. : )

We got there and the waiters seemed stressed out as they were having trouble handling the traffic.  The tables were mostly full, but nobody was waiting to be seated, so not too busy.

We seated ourselves at a very wet table and waved down a waiter for the order sheet.  
I had to grab napkins from other tables and it took our table and several other tables numerous times to flag down staff for condiments once the food arrived. 

On top of that, the three waiters were yelling back and forth the whole time we ate. They seemed to be confused about the order entry system as they actively ignored customers while all three huddled around the entry terminal. 

The dim sum?  Very bland, but what can you expect for 2.50 a dish. Pretty good bargain but you can get better quality for similar prices just around the corner. It may not have helped that a waiter spilled a bottle of Windex on the floor, so the entire upper floor smelled of window cleaner. However, sub par dim sum and a poor environment means we won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is a 3.5 in my opinion. 

This restaurant is spacious and clean when my group of 5 entered. The washroom could use a bit more work.

For most of the staff they greeted us kindly. 

My group ordered from both the AYCE dim sum and sushi. 

The sushi was pretty standard, but the size was smaller than let's say spring sushi. Like when I first saw them i automatically thought midget sushi or like baby sushi. They were cute but small. Taste was standard, good but nothing outstanding. 

For the dim sum portion they had a good variety suitable for even vegetarians. 

The service was kinda fast. As soon as we placed our order I swear like 5 mins later we got a few of our items. But the other items came at a reasonable time. I was quite disappointed when some of our orders didn't come. We didn't bother to ask for it because we were so stuffed. They had pretty good dim sum. My friend enjoyed her chicken feet which were huge. My favourite was the crispy shrimp dumpling with salad dressing ( which was basically just those kraft mayo mini packs). Taste over all for the dim sum portion was good. My craving for dim sum was indeed satisfied. 

I liked how you can pay credit, debit and cash. 

I didn't like how the employees were hovering over my group when we were close to finish eating and when we were done they kept coming around multiple times but we didn't ask for the bill. It's not like there was a huge line waiting for a table coz they had tons of tables open. I was also upset that only my two friends out of 5 of us ordered a bottle of sprite but we all got charged for a sprite. We didn't say anything because it was just like $1.50 but we should have so that's our fault. And I didn't like how the cashier purposely gave me smaller change so she could get a tip."}
{"text":"My favourite place in toronto. You have to try their peanutbutter noodles and special wontons. You can't get them anywhere else in Toronto and it is a specialty in Fuzhou, China. One of the only places in China town where you can get authentic chinese food."}
{"text":"It took 35 minutes for our food to arrive. At dim sum restaurants, this would normally take about 10 minutes once you've placed your order. We were told by our server that they \"forgot\" about our order. Not cool. 

In addition to being inattentive, the staff were extremely loud and boisterous. I noticed that a lot of them were on break but they should be more mindful of how they present themselves in front of customers. For such a nice looking restaurant (two levels, classy decor, and floor to ceiling windows), I was expecting the staff to present themselves in a more professional manner. Guess not. 

The food was good with the exception of the xiao long bao. The soup dumplings were steamed in mini aluminum tarts (I'm assuming that it would make eating the dumplings a lot easier?) and I could taste a very faint plastic-y/metallic after taste after eating one of them...they could have just placed the xiao long bao in a mini dish and place the dish in the steamer. 

There are definitely much better dim sum restaurants to go to. Although the food was decent (with the exception of the xiao long bao), I would prefer it if it the staff were much more attentive to the patrons around them."}
{"text":"It was definitely the worst meal I've ever had in GTA. 

It claimed to be a Dim Sum buffet. The waitress refused to take orders. Whatever you ordered, they just provide double deep fry food and noodles to make you full. And there are no sauces come with vegetables, no syrup with dessert, unless you asked. Even I saw something I ordered earlier served to other table, the waitress keep claimed that everything is sold out.

I wish I could give \"-2\"!!! I will never ever recommend any of my friends to go to this horrible place."}
{"text":"Great place for dim sum with an extensive menu and reasonably priced specials. Coming from NYC, where we constantly rave about how great our dim sum is, this definitely topped our local places. The best part is the staff, who cater to your every need and are extremely personable. Best of all, for us Americans, is the exchange rate!"}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday, they charged regular prices on all items. Also, charged me for tea money. Very bad service, thirty restaurant, super noise, dim sum not good at all. This was locals style dim sum nothing like Hong Kong style. Force to share table with others. Very disappointed. Will never go again."}
{"text":"Never have I been nauseated in a restaurant before this place. Low quality meat, doughy dim sum, overall bland...
The service was below mediocre.

And I literary felt sick while eating. Keep away!
There  are much better places in Toronto, and even in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best dim sum restaurant in Chinatown at the moment.  This newly opened dim sum joint offers great quality dim sum  and service to match.  Waitress was attentive and friendly.

A nice interior loft space with second floor and pleasing modern decor.  We checked out this place on a wednesday before 11am to take advantage of the awesome early bird $1.88 price.  Regular price is still inexpensive starting at $2.38 for small items.

Great selection of standard items as well as a variety of others with congee and fried rice/noodle dishes.  Really stand out items were the crystal buns - really great skin texture and tenderness - smooth, mildly sweet custard. Thousand layer cake was scrumptious with great custard as well.    

Definitely a must-try!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has awesome dim sum! Having lived in South East China, I know good Dim Sum! Good selection. Excellent value! Washrooms are clean. The General Manager is charming and pleasant to deal with. The other waitstaff were rather non-de script. This place fills up fast but the turnover is good so you don't have to wait long."}
{"text":"Everything tasted fake ! Quite a disappointment ! Would not return to this place due to poor quality of food !"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Rosewood has dim sum that is affordable, tasty and fills your belly. What more do you want? Sure the service can be sketchy at times, but just raise your hand to get their attention. They can't read your mind. It's the usual suspects when it comes to dim sum here. There's plenty of windows so there is lots of natural lighting which is different than most restaurants in Chinatown. The food is hot and tasty. Careful you don't burn your tongue on the deep fried goodness (ie. deep fried shrimp dumpling with salad dressing on the side).

Ordering is by paper so be warned that you probably order way too much, but then again you can take it home. They do have a menu with pictures so you can see what you're ordering if you don't want to spin the wheel. I believe the prices are $3/dish (excluding holidays some some notes dishes) between 9-5 on weekdays? I can't remember. When you come during the weekday, it's not super busy so you can take your time eating and talking to your friends. The staff doesn't seem to mind that though it might be a different story on weekends or meal time rush hour, but that's just a given.

The one dish I might skip on is the deep fried squid tentacles. There's too much batter... I personally like it when it's got a light coating of salt and spices, but that's just my personal preference."}
{"text":"Very cheap and very delicious. I'm definitely going back here. The Noodles with beef and sprouts was my favorite. The meet is so flavourful. The sprouts gives it a great texture. Best had quickly while still hot. The portions r great so if u order 2 dishes it is good for 3 people. 

PS: I haven't tried their Dim Sum yet. Plus I hear it's expensive."}
{"text":"The last time I had dim sum in Chinatown was so long ago I don't remember anything good about it.  We've ended up going to Markham for dim sum.  On a rare occasion, we went to Rosewood with another family.  

I was very skeptical. Now I am a fan.  Talk about fast service and great quality.  I was impressed with nearly everything we ate.  The Cheung Fun (both plain and pork) were perfect and definitely made on site.  It actually came to the table nearly at the end of our meal but it was worth the wait.   

I recommend this place for anyone who wants a positive experience."}
{"text":"This is a really good dim sum place. We got seven different things and each was served hot and delicious. We were seated almost immediately at 2:15 on a Sunday. Service was reasonably quick and the restaurant is clean and pleasant inside. Among the things we tried: fried crispy two milks, soup dumplings, shrimp and pork dumpling soup, vegetarian pan fried steam buns, sticky rice with preserved meat in banana leaves, beef balls on peas, and Chiu chow fen guo. All excellent. It was *plenty* for two hungry people. Now we're stuffed! Time to walk home!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was quite busy and only had two waitresses on duty. Service was bad. First, we get seated next to their smelly mop and bucket in the corner. She was back and forth with the mop throughout the restaurant when no one spilled anything. Doesn't she have tables and customers that she shouldn't be ignoring? I asked for a menu and she brought me a sheet with pictures of dim sum on it. I said, \"no, a menu please.\" She responded, \"ya, pictures so you see what dim sum is.\" Listen lady, I've been eating dim sum since I was in the womb. I don't need pictures. I need a menu to order food. Everything they brought to us, they slammed the dishes on the table like they were mad at the world. The food was ok, I've had better dim sum elsewhere. But for the prices, not worth the experience. When it came time to ask for take out containers for our leftovers and for the bill, I couldn't get either waitresses' attention because they were both sitting down at a table eating! For a $56 bill, we tipped $4, but honestly, they didn't deserve anything. We probably would have waited all night for our change anyway."}
{"text":"We originally planned on Asian Legend for dim sum based on Yelp reviews, but quickly left after they (1) opened an hour later than expected - we were the very first customers and (2) charged $6 a plate for dim sum! Ridiculous. Since we didn't have cell service as tourists,  we crowdsourced reviews based on where the older Chinese ladies were patronizing... Rosewood. 

Weekday dim sum special was cheap ($2 per dish) and the food quality surprisingly good - on par with some of the better dim sum places in my native NYC, and in some cases better (we've attached food pictures). The gf liked the tea.

Decor was generic Asian restaurant but clean and modern. Very traditional China."}
{"text":"It's 2am and you can't sleep so what do you do? You Dim sum! Go ahead, get your dim sum fix here. 
All the items taste quite alright. Don't be fooled by the lofty appearance of this place and their fancy spider-esque LED chandelier; there's no 5 star service here and the food is not served on any fancy chinaware.
This is an affordable, no frills, late night dim sum-mery (yeah I just coined that).
If there's one comment I must make, it would be about the decor. This is gotta be some of the most atrocious interior designs I have ever witnessed. Luckily, I am quite used to it because of my Asian background and this is a common trend amongst Asian establishments.
So if you're having late night dim sum withdrawals, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"So I came back for another round of cheap dimsum on a weekday. The price went up from 2.50 to 2.80. I did try a few items I wouldn't normally get. They were lotus paste tapioca cup, tofu fa, sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf and double fried milk. The tapioca cup was like sago in a cup and filled with lotus paste. The double fried milk was like fried cream puff. They were both okay, nothing amazing. Tofu fa was a letdown, it wasn't smooth nor silky (boo). The sticky rice was delicious. Normally I don't like sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf but I do like this one. So thumbs up! Other than that nothing much has changed."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch dim-sum at 10am. No lineup and you can sit wherever you want. The restaurant is clean and bright. There are actually many choices in the menu. Two of us ordered 8 dim-sum dishes. Food is above Chinatown average, and so is the price. We paid $50 for the meal."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant for dim sum many times and enjoyed the food but we decided to order take out this time because we were crunch for time. 

We called 20 minutes before expected time of arrival and when I got there the order was still not ready. They didn't put in our order until we got there. So we ended up waiting 15 minutes for an order that was supposed to be done in 10 minutes as told by the representative who took our order in the phone. 

When we brought our food home our food wasn't even cooked properly. Our ribs were not cooked and still rare. Look at the pictures. The pieces were stuck together and not cooked thoroughly."}
{"text":"I have had the worst experience at this restaurant. The people working there; especially the two female front staff working there tonight, was loud and liked to talk a lot of the customers behind their backs. Since their background is the same as mine, I could easily understand what they were talking about. My mom has a physical disability and has a difficult time walking. She goes to sit down at a table and immediately, I hear the two talk about her and my dad. It was despicable. 

I don't care about the food - whether it's good or not. Their service was horrible; saying negative things behind the guests' back. They knew my family's language is the same as their's, so I think they wanted us to hear it, unless they're terrible at whispering.

I will never come back to this restaurant and I do not recommend this place. Rude and obnoxious front-end staff made the overall experience terrible."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews there seems to be some mixed opinions about this place. The weekday special is now $2.80 which I think is still cheaper than most other dim sum places around. I can appreciate that the service isn't great, but that's usually more the norm with chinese restaurants than the exception.

I've been here a few times so far and for the most part I find the quality of the food to be above average compared to other places in chinatown. Things taste fresh and not like it's been sitting around all day. That is also the benefit of ordering dim sum off a menu vs the cart although you do not get that traditional experience.

I would recommend this place if you're in chinatown and especially if you're coming 9-4 on a weekday!"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh. Nice manager. Menu with pictures!!!

Heard about this place from some extended family members and decided to give it a try. The place is very modern, very clean. We came for their weekday lunch special: dim sum 12pm to 4pm, $3 per dish. 

Ordered on a piece of paper. Manager was very friendly. 

The food wasn't really anything special but for its price it's not bad. Selection was a bit limited."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite joint for dim sum in Toronto Chinatown...

... but that's not really saying a whole lot.  If you like greasy and salty dim sum, stick with Rol San and loudly proclaim you don't know shit about dim sum.

If you can't make it out to Scarborough or Markham for dim sum, Rosewood is probably the best joint downtown in my limited experience in Toronto."}
{"text":"Fast and efficient service and great prices. World class dim sum. Try the pan fried pork dumplings. A meal on their own. Every dish is only $2.80 before 4pm."}
{"text":"Where do I start? According to the sign it says that they opened today (January 28th, 2017) however the reviews say otherwise. We were open to this because a) most customers here were not Caucasian, b) there was no line (that should have been a dead giveaway, especially during Chinese New Year) and c) it looked clean and newly renovated.
We went in, they accommodated us with preferred location on where to sit. It was busy but not packed. The decor is clean and modern. Two floors. We sat on the main floor. The usual dim sum din(TM BarbaraD) wasn't evident as in the back, where we were seated, the ceiling is low, so it's not as noisy because of talking, but the waitresses also cleared the tables and threw plates into the bus pans so hard that they were breaking - loudly. Also, upstairs, a server had dropped some plates/dishes and you could hear them crash down the stairs. Hopefully no one was hurt. The bathrooms smell of fresh paint and are nicely designed. HOWEVER, of the two women's washrooms the first had the (large, heavy) soap dispenser held on by double sided tape. As I was entering the room, the dispenser fell into the sink. Luckily it didn't fall when I was trying to wash my hands or on a small child. Then I noticed that there was NO toilet paper left. Plenty of counter space (that houses boxes of garbage bags) to keep it there though. So I went over to the other women's washroom. UGH. Full of diarrhea and almost overflowing. Good thing I always have kleenex in my bag (for the other washroom). We ordered the har gow, deep fried rice rolls, pork taro pastries and deep fried squid tentacles. First came the squid tentacles: I order these everywhere I go, but this was a first: the order is quite small (Rol San serves portions that are at least twice or three times as large) - maybe 6 or 8 pieces. Half of them were STONE COLD. I've been eating dim sum for over 25 years now, so I know what should be cold and what shouldn't be. However, we'd been waiting so long for any of our orders to arrive we were half way through the dish before we realized that someone had thrown ice cold leftover squid tentacles on our plate. HORRIBLE. Then came the rice rolls - they're supposed to be served at least slightly warm but again, they were STONE COLD. Then the taro cakes - they were good and hot (as they should be). Finally the har gow came (everything came so far apart). I also order har gow wherever I go and I can tell you this was the absolute worst. Someone had poured what tasted like a half a cup of salt inside each dumpling. DISGUSTING Again, we were so hungry from waiting so long that we didn't say anything to the servers (who were otherwise occupied). I had been excited to find another dim sum option but it's too bad because in order for me to ever come back here, they would need to do the following: 1. Hire more staff so that people aren't waiting so long for food to be delivered hot. 2. Don't allow staff to serve food that's supposed to be hot as cold. We're not stupid. Word gets around quickly. 3. Have extra staff checking the washrooms, refilling toilet paper, making sure toilets aren't backed up. 4. Make sure you hire a handyman to do things properly like attach a soap dispenser on the wall SAFELY. 5. Keep extra rolls of toilet paper in the bathroom so that customers don't end up blocking the toilet with paper towels. Disappointing."}
{"text":"My new go-to dim sum place, its made fresh, shrimp is deveined and clean, better than Pearl or Dim Sum King. Service will always be terrible with the Chinese. That isn't racism it's just fact. Just be assertive and you'll get what you need. 

Coke is also serviced in a glass bottle, that also gave this place an extra half star!"}
{"text":"THEY bleach white  dishware....did a poor in washing.bleach off...tea smelled like bleach..complained game me.another bleached.tea.
FOOD is.standard dim sum0"}
{"text":"Rosewood Chinese cuisine is pretty good. Good service, the restaurant itself is beautiful, decorative and the food was good. 

Some of the Dim Sum items like the Shrimp rice roll \"??\" is a bit larger than your typical shrimp rice roll. 

It is ashamed that they don't serve the food with the carts. You know you're calling the cart ladies to come over, putting the food at your table and it's fun. But restaurant serves the food cooked in order. Besides, the restaurant is kind of small.

However, just over the past week, the restaurant has changed their business model completely. The Dim Sum special before 9 am to 4pm, each item is 3.00 dollars. But now it's 9 am to 12 pm $3.30.

\"Before\" after 12 pm, weekends, & holidays regular price S ($3.28), M ($4.28), L (4.98) & XL ($5.99)

\"Now\" after 12 pm, weekends, & holidays regular price is S ($3.48), M ($4.38), L ($5.38) & and XL ($6.98)

It may be extremely expensive, but I'll still go. Only going at the weekdays, in the morning between 9 am and 11 am. I'll give the restaurant 3.7/5 stars"}
{"text":"All shrimp everything! Came here for dinner and it was delicious. 

The fried rice was prepared the way I like it (not drenched in soy sauce) and all the sides were perfect (not too oily and flavourful)! I love har gow and shrimp filled anything -- a great way to end the night. Definitely a good late night/dimsum restaurant. 

Environment wise, the restaurant was clean and the interior was nice but simple. I found it odd that there wasn't any music playing, but maybe that's just me. 

Will be coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"This is a great Dim Sum restaurant with a great selection of food to try from. Probably one of my favourite Dim Sum places I like to go to in Downtown Toronto. Very good service no matter where you sit and the food comes out fairy quick (I've only ordered from the Dim Sum menu). The portions are good size and always serves perfectly cooked food, including my favourite.. Custard Buns! They do offer AYCE which is great and also cheaper during the week days. If you're not up for AYCE they do À la carte. As for the other stuff on the menu (sushi, mains) I haven't looked into too much but it seems good. I recommend trying this restaurant if you're in the area and feeling for some Asian cuisine!"}
{"text":"The food was not fresh and mediocre overall in taste.  The fried dumpling was not crispy.  It was soggy.  The glutinous rice was hard and not sticky.  The crispy noodles was also soggy.  The beef was not fresh and looked like it was left there for a while before being served.  

The worst was waiting 40 minutes waiting for everything from refilling water and tea, to asking for a napkin.  It was a self serve restaurant, except you have no access to any of the tools needed to eat.  When I inquired about our food, the staff gave me a shrug and told me that it's not her problem.  I understand it's busy, but at least be courteous and professional."}
{"text":"Would not return here .. came with a group for all you can eat dim sum. Half of our orders were pretty good, like the creamy egg yolk buns, pork buns, shumai and hargow but some dishes were awful. Our sticky rice with meat was cold in the middle. A lot of the meat was very poor quality and barely edible.  Service was quite unpleasant as well."}
{"text":"i've been there once and i will probably go back soon
the dim'sun are really good and really cheap. i've been with one friend and we had many choices for only 20 bucks. 
the service is ok, i would recommend to check your cup and glasses before, mine were really dirty!"}
{"text":"Not bad i should say. $2.20 for any item is a bonus. Food were great too."}
{"text":"Before leaving Toronto on a 3:30 pm Sunday train, I was craving Dim Sum so I decided to venture up to Dundas Street with the hope of getting in somewhere and then out again quickly. I only had an hour to do so and, coming from Rogers Centre, I knew that time would be tight. 

Not knowing the city or the area (but knowing that the closer to University Avenue, the better), I settled on this place. At 2 pm on a Sunday, the place was still packed with the lunch crowd. Since downstairs was full, I was initially motioned upstairs (it has two levels) but had no luck there either. Upon seeing me come back downstairs, one of the hostesses quickly found me a table. 

From my experience (both in North America and Hong Kong), service at most Dim Sum places can be slower as many Chinese like to take their time and visit while eating. Not so with this place. In fact, if I could use one word, it would be frantic. However, in spite of this place's clear popularity, the service and food were excellent. 
I think the waitresses understood my desire to get in and out quickly because I was in and gone in just over thirty minutes. Finally, the value just couldn't be beat - including tax and tip, six dishes came to less than $25. 

All in all, an excellent experience ... I will return.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is a big no no. I do not suggest it unless you have any to pay more than what you asked for. Overall food is satisfactory, nothing crazy, edible but not great. It is no where near places like Rol San or even the Chinese food courts nearby.

My first time there it was good, food was the same but service could use some work. We were sat at a dirty table (amongst an entire room of clean ones, there is only one other couple in the restaurant), and when we asked the server to clean it we were handed the cloth and told to clean it ourselves. It's not like it was busy, but since I went with my friend for her birthday, no fuss was made. The rest of it went normal.

Now the second time I went was with my parents two months after. This ended up in utter disappointment. I ordered something similar to what I got before with my friend. At least this time, I didn't have to clean my own table. But when it was time to get the bill, the total didn't match up with what we originally got. So I politely asked if this was the right bill, and they told me that it was and they aren't stupid to mess up something that simple. I wasn't trying to offend them but my subtotal was 20$ off what the original was supposed to be. I asked them why there is a price difference and they told me that the prices have increased. I then asked why we weren't notified when ordering because it was different from the menu and we were told \"You should know\". I asked if there was a sign and he said there wasn't, and when I asked to see the menu again to check the prices, they started to shout at me and say that if we don't want to pay then we should haul our ass to the police station. According to them, they changed it last month and haven't changed the menu yet (just saying I'm not asking you to reprint all the menus but it is not hard to either: tell the customer when ordering of the changes in price, make a sign, or getting some white out to make some changes) So I asked to speak with the manager and she claimed that she runs this place and doesn't want to be \"bothered by such lowly customers who can't pay their bill\". So we left the money on the table and just left.

The price of each item on the menu increased 3-8$ so buyer beware of the difference between the menu and what will be written on your bill."}
{"text":"My new go-to place for dim sum in Chinatown. Yes, there is much better dim sum in Markham / Scarborough, but for downtown, this is a good option for the these reasons:

- $1.99 / dish on weekdays from 9am - 4pm. This is the cheapest I've found in Chinatown
- Quality of the food is pretty good. No, it's not out of this world, but it holds its own. I would say Rol San has better tasting dim sum, but I don't go there often because of the long wait, which brings me to the next point...
- No wait! You can actually call ahead and get reservations, which is a huge plus since i HATE waiting over half an hour for dim sum. I've done this for both weekdays and weekend dim sum.

Decor wise, it's actually on the nicer side, much better than Rol San or Noble, which are the other 2 places we go. The service is also pretty good. Also, this is the only dim sum place my Mom (who lives in Scarborough) would go to downtown. Enough said."}
{"text":"I've been to the other less fancy dim sum places in Chinatown but was not impressed with this place at all. Given it was a weekend, the place was packed and we were tossed around to various tables before we were finally seated. The waitresses were quite rude and the service was slow. The dim sum wasn't bad but honestly, waiting for all the dishes to come out took quite a while. For those looking for an adventure, they even offer AYCE sushi and dim sum. Nonetheless, I will not be returning here again."}
{"text":"I came with my Mom and Brother for lunch last week. For a Monday morning this place was packed! We had to wait a bit for the table. The decor looks pretty modern but I don't know why I still felt the place felt a little gross or dirty. Just a weird feeling. My friends and I usually come here because we prefer this over Dragon City. In a perfect world I could get to Markham for better dim sum. We ordered about 10 dishes ranging from Har Gow, Tripe, Tendon, Turnip Patties, Chicken Feet etc. We thought majority of the dishes were good but not amazing. The beef rolls weren't even hot which was disappointing. I'm assuming some stuff is microwaved and some are steamed. There is a good variety of food, every dish for $2.50 if you come during dim sum happy hours on weekdays. Weekend prices follow the typical expensive prices. I would come back again if I had a craving for dim sum while in Chinatown as they have a good selection. But other than that this place isn't that special. The servers are pretty noisy with them yelling at each other since there is an upstairs and downstairs seating area."}
{"text":"The tripe/turnip dish was the best out of my choices.. The bean curd skin was not cooked long enough so flavourless and tough and the dumpling skin was too thick and doughy. Good service though."}
{"text":"Was fortunate enough to try a lot of different items! I usually get all the same things when I go to dim sum (the classic stuff) but this time I tried a lot of new stuff that I think (?) are unique to rosewood.

Prices are pretty good, a bit on the cheaper side but not THE cheapest. The cheapest places I think make everything from frozen anyways. 

A lot of the dishes have GENEROUS portions of shrimp, it surprised me how densely packed and flavourful the shrimp were. I really enjoyed the steamed shrimp wrapped in noodle... This was one of their new items. They also had something similar, I think it was the same shrimp ball but covered in a deep fried noodle coating that was unique and crispy. We also had deep fried shrimp dumplings that came with a creamy, white salad dressing and deep fried shrimp rolls that came with a red (vinegar?) dipping sauce. The shrimp stuff does not have a bunch of veggie or random fillers but is all shrimp and seasoning!!!! Amazing.

The sticky rice had ground pork and a big slice of Chinese sausage. It did not disappoint.

I also loved the need tendon. I think I ate the whole plate myself and every single piece was perfectly soft and juicy. The flavour was a bit different from my regular place but in a good way.

Deep fried milk pudding: my first time having this dish (outside of a night market). The coating was light and crispy, inside warm and soft. It was yummy but I wish it came with condensed milk drizzled on top. Portion wise, it's big.

Tried a few other items but the ones I listed above are my reccomendations.

Bonus info:
- They have several flavours of ice-cream
- AYCE options
- several ice-cream flavours
- free wifi
- 2 floors; large capacity of seats
Very clean (even the washroom) and posh looking (they have chandeliers!)"}
{"text":"5 stars all the way!!! Best dim sum in Chinatown! Why you say? Well, restaurant is fairly new and clean. It's nicely decorated with 2 floors and there's plenty of seats and tables. Dim sum is made to order, so they are fresh, and are not sit out in carts. Sit down, look at the menu check off list and indicate how many items you want. To the newbies to dim sum, no worries, they have a picture menu upon request. Everything ordered was phenomenal. The dumplings were so plump and juicy, the fried items was light and not greasy the dessert buns was yummy, but you gotta eat them fast or else the buns get hard as it cools down. Unfortunately they brought out the dessert buns before anything else so it wasn't that great by the time we got to try them. The best part of the meal? EVERYTHING, no matter what size of dish you get, whether it's small, medium or large, was just $2.20!!! I went on a weekday around noon. I'm not sure if it's only a weekday special as I did not see any mention of it anywhere but it was such a huge surprise. If I had known this at the beginning for sure I would have chosen a lot more large size dishes! Check out my bill! 14 items for under $35 for 4 people with a ton of leftovers!"}
{"text":"This place use to be the place to grab dim sum when it first opened up years ago. I am not sure what happened to all the previous wait staff, but the current ones are very loud/rude/yappy and rarely in uniform and very forgetful/not forgiving. Now they offer ayce sushi? I'll pass. Be warned that they also charge 1.50 per head even if you don't drink tea and the fact the cashier will purposely give you back more change then normal.
I will likely not return if I am craving dim sum.

The restaurant is nicely furnished and have since increased more seating on the main floor. The 2nd floor is still there, but it is always dark and never have any patrons. (Use to allow patrons to sit anywhere they feel comfortable)"}
{"text":"They changed management and underwent renovations. It's definitely not as good as before, but will do in a pinch. The service is subpar, the food is still passable. My test for dim sum restaurants is to see if they have hot mustard. They still do."}
{"text":"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our dim sum experience here. The staff were so exceptionally friendly and courteous. All the food was fresh and tasty. Our favorites were the soup dumpling and meat rolls. Give this a try!"}
{"text":"Dim sum was good. But the waitresses don't speak any English. We asked for water and they gave us a bowl. We ordered steamed roast pork buns to go and when we opened the box, we got the baked version instead. They still got it wrong when one of us spoke Chinese. The rice noodles (cheung fun) were good. We had most of the available versions of rice noodles: the shrimp, beef, roast pork, and fried dough. They had fried milk curds as dimsum!! I can't find these in NYC so I ordered them. It was really good, just like the ones I had when I was in Hong Kong. Overall, the food was good and my family enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I left this Chinatown restaurant with mixed feelings after a Saturday afternoon lunch. The dim sum wasn't bad, in fact there really wasn't anything wrong with it at all. It just didn't live up to my expectations. The establishment itself boasts an impressive loft that looks over the bottom floor, and some modest but clean decor. We reviewed the menu quickly, and almost all the staples were included. We opted for the siu mai, har gow, bbq rice noodle rolls, shrimp and chive dumplings, deep fried fish, fried pork and leek dumplings, fried shrimp rolls, vegetable spring rolls, and stuffed eggplant.

The impressive notes were that the pork in the siu mai was tasty, lean, white and evenly textured. The skins on the har gow were just the right thickness, the shrimp and chive dumplings were fresh and plump, and the fried pork and leek dumplings were very tasty! The house chili oil was well-balanced and offered heat and flavour. I also always appreciate a good Chinese hot mustard, and you can definitely find it here. The Shanghai soup dumplings fell short for me, served in tin cups and very doughy. The eggplant was also slightly undercooked and bitter, with very little filling in proportion to size.

Overall I would say Rosewood is worth trying, but you won't be pledging your dim sum loyalty."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever. We're seated at 12.15 pmamd until 1.45 pm, we weren't served with any food. Left the place hungry and without eating anything. Never returning to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Really good dim sum here! Feels like Hong Kong, which I missed so much! The beef balls, rich noodles and chicken feet were really good! $3 for each dim sum too. Awesome place! I would recommend this place to visitors!"}
{"text":"My favourite chinatown dim sum spot. Always busy, fast service, and really cheap for the amount of food you get. I always leave with leftovers!"}
{"text":"Came here for a craving of dim sum downtown. After searching on Yelp for dim sum places, this place came up with pretty good reviews. The location is conveniently located on Dundas in the heart of Chinatown. The resto has two floors and the service is the service expected in an Asian restaurant. Menu had a variety of all dim sum dishes where you have the option of all day dim sum at regular prices or discount prices depending on the day and time you go. The food came out quickly and served hot. My favs were the haw gow and rice noodle rolls. The restaurant definitely has its run down flaws but for the location and craving of dim sum... the resto suited the craving. Overall can't complain about the food or service."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for many years they used to be ok but after they renovated the customer service is just horrible. They charge .80 per person for tea no one around Chinatown does this. It's feb 3rd and they considered today a holiday so they are not honouring the weekday special price, are they celebrating the Super bowl weekend? I have always received ok service before but today was just insane in here, one of the servers was on the phone screaming at someone and slammed her hand loudly on the table, the look on the customers faces were priceless we were all scared. We received attitude from a different server throughout our dim sum experience, she was intentionally throwing food down on the table showing us she was mad at something. When she gave us the bill on the tray she dropped the tray on the table loudly to once again show us she was mad. I usually tip 15 to 20% but this time I gave them a toonie on a 45 dollar bill. I didn't want to even leave a tip but after reading another yelp review on this restaurant I was scared they would chase me down in the street as they did another reviewer. The food was just ok I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Even though the food was delicious, we ended up spending $80 for two people (yes we did have leftovers). Too much!!!! I'm better off eating dimsum in Scarborough. 

The shrimp dumplings, sui mai, fried octopus, shrimp rice noodle, deep fried shrimp were all delicious! Get it all! They even have pictures for you to see if you don't know what youre ordering. There's AYCE but only after 5pm. 

It did satisfy my dimsum craving though. Just won't be doing it again. The price hurts :("}
{"text":"The vast majority of the food ordered was inedible and all servers did an excellent job of making my party feel unwelcome at the restaurant. I would give zero stars if possible. I am the farthest thing from a picky eater so believe me when I say: DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"One of the best experiences I've had at a Chinese restaurant. Probably because I was with friends, but that's only one party of it.

Decor was modern and clean. Bathrooms clean!

The AYCE was my first time hearing about such magic, so that made me happy.

Their menu had all my favorites and each item had a picture so that people who don't eat dim sum often actually know what they're ordering. And dessert was part of it! Only downside was they ran out of egg tarts.

The food tasted amazing and was fresh. I'd surprisingly recommend the egg yolk buns... They kind of tasted like custard. The sticky rice was also really good, but careful because it's a lot! Of course siu mai and shrimp rice rolls were the best! The meat rice rules were a bit strange. Oh and the Shanghai noodles were also really yummy!!!

One warning is that each person is charged 80¢ for tea."}
{"text":"Only place that I know of that serves all day all you can eat dim sum. Food gets delivered really quick and staff is friendly as well as attentive."}
{"text":"I came to this place twice.  At my first visit, they forgot about my order slip.  I saw other customers that came in after us being served. After waiting close to half a hour, I had to remind them about us! The lady at the counter had a surprised face because she forgot to pass our order sheet to the back kitchen. Second visit with my mom, we were seated by the washroom and the smell is not pleasant at all. I asked nicely if we can switch tables since I saw 2 tables were now free. We were only served tea and did not start eating yet. So we did not dirty the table. The server declined and said all tables are like that!!  She also talked about us to her co-workers.  It was an unpleasant experience since I rarely treat my mom! When we finished eating and walked out to the door and my mother realized she forgot a bag that contained her jacket. The staff there was hesitant to return it to her. She was asking if that was really hers!? Like wtf? We just stepped away for less than 20 seconds. The staff here speak poor English so we speak Chinese to them. There is no language barrier but these staff are plain rude. I won't come back again. There are other better restaurants in this area. Do not come here, unless you want to be treated less than human! Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me."}
{"text":"The food was okay- not great, not terrible either. I've definitely had better dim sum, be it Toronto or in other places such as Hong Kong. The prices weren't too bad, relatively reasonable. What disappointed me tremendously was the poor service. You tick what dishes you want on a piece of paper, and then its confirmed by a waiter/waitress before being sent to the kitchen through a computer system. I did not order a particular item, and the waitress confirmed all the dishes that I ordered (that specific item not being one of them). However, I received the dish and immediately told the waitress that I didn't order it, and so she took it away. However, later when I look at the bill, it was on there, so I tell the wait staff but that waitress kept on rudely insisting that I ordered it. The whole time I am polite and trying to explain to her in 3 different languages (Cantonese, Mandarin, and English) that I did not order it. She finally relented and cancelled that item from the bill but gave me a lot of attitude. I was unhappy at this point and so I did not give a tip, and when she saw the receipt she proceeded to grumble and mutter in Mandarin that I didn't leave any tip and she kept on shaking her head, thinking I did not understand her. It was just a simple thing that she blamed me for when it was entirely her problem. I cannot believe this complete lack of customer service- if my manager or supervisor saw me treating customers like this, I would have to pack my stuff and head on home, not having to return to work the next day. One thing my mom taught me was to always respect others- which I did in this case, but when someone disrespects me, I'll certainly call them out on it. I reported her to the restaurant manager and he apologised, but I certainly will not be returning to this establishment. I entered looking forward to a relaxing Saturday lunch, only to leave disappointed and shocked, because a waitress did not have the minimum level of common sense, professionalism, and respect that is key to this industry, and life in general."}
{"text":"Tried this place with friends after getting a craving for AYCE dim sum. You really do get a large selection of standard dim sum fare to choose from. The food is okay, but a bit heavy on the starch side to fill you up and for some reason, each dish they served to us was lukewarm. If it was hot it would've been much better but most of the dishes unfortunately were not. That was disappointing, especially since we were right by the dumbwaiter moving food up and dishes down. We didn't get everything we ordered either, despite multiple attempts to ask where it was. Overall, the experience was about \"meh\", with more AYCE dim sum options in the GTA now, I may not be back to Rosewood."}
{"text":"This place is now grossly overpriced. They used to have generous happy hour pricing that lasted until 2 pm or so, meaning every dim sum item - a handful of  special plates excepted - was $3. It was never the best establishment for dim sum, but that was okay because prices were fair and the quality of food was decent. Our group of regulars tolerated the occasional under-cooked dish, tough meat, lukewarm plate, or missed order because the price was right and most of our orders were satisfactory. On a good day, it was a 4; on its worst day, a 3. 

Not only have their prices suddenly increased ~13% across the board, but happy hour pricing now only applies between 10 am and 12 pm. This resulted in a bill that was about 50% higher than we typically spend, and neither the quality of the food nor the quality of service justifies such a drastic price hike. 

I suspect the reason for the price hike is due to do the (odd) decision to start offering sushi and sashimi as part of an all you can eat option ($18). For the past few months, we were always asked if we wanted all you can eat despite handing the wait staff a marked a la carte menu. From what I understand, the quality of the sushi/sashimi is decent, but I'm not sure what drove the owner(s) to change a perfectly fine Chinese restaurant to this fusion buffet model. I went there for dim sum, and only dim sum. 

What I do know is that very few people order the sushi; as weekly lunchtime customers, we'd see one or two tables with sushi, at best. I have to imagine there's a lot of sushi-grade fish going to waste. It would appear they're doubling-down on the buffet offering and hoping it brings in more money per head, but I think they'll end up losing business; they've certainly lost mine."}
{"text":"Don't know why this place only has 3 stars. It should be at least 4 for dim sum and service. They have two floors and plenty of seating. Even that time when we were here for Chinese New Years, it would maybe a 20 minute wait. The fried squid tentacles are TO DIE FOR! YUM! I would say that they are fair on their pricing, but maybe a tad expensive for what you get. We only come here when the folks are in town, but it's location is so central in Chinatown that it's a must. Unlike Dim Sum King (waaaaay on the third floor of an obscure building), or the dim sum place up on the Nth floor of the Dragon City Centre, or that other dim sum place with the HUGE DIM SUM SIGN... This place is near Dundas and Spadina, it's really spacious and is no bs. Give it a go, we always come here after trying the dim sum places previously mentioned. This one's the best in downtown Toronto and trust me, we like good value!"}
{"text":"The food quality has definitely declined over the past year.
They branched out to Japanese food and increased their AYCE price.
I had dinner on Thursday and it came to $35 with a 15% tip.
It was definitely not worth $35.

I used to like this place because it was the only place that specialized in AYCE dimsum with a fair price, but now they have more menu items with lower quality food. It also seems like some of the portion increased as well. 1 order of some of the items were huge and it seemed like it was made to make us full.

I hope they have a dimsum only option since most of their dimsum still tasted pretty good.

Another interesting thing (that I didn't reflect in my review) was the waiter. He kept coming over and rearranging our table items. He would occasionally come over and move the soy sauce, water, etc. . . and leave. It wasn't because our table was full and he wanted to put more things on. At on point he came over and he gestured us where to put our water."}
{"text":"2.5 Star

This review of Rosewood Chinese Cuisine is based on dinner experience! I have not been here for dim sum yet.. and when they said \"ALL DAY\" dim sum is not true as dim sum is only served till 4 pm.

The restaurant was really quiet on a Sunday evening as only the main floor was opened with just 3 tables of customers.

Rosewood is really a Fuchow/Cantonese restaurant so there are some items on the menu that reflected that. 

With a group of 8 we shared:

Lychee Pork ($9.99)
- The pork was really lean and lightly coated before deep fried and round off with a tangy sauce
- not bad with just a hint of sweet and sour.. I do love that it is not too heavy! 

Yellowtail Grouper ($28.99) 2 dishes
- Soup was good with the tofu and 
- The fish with stir fried veggie was really bland

House Fried Vermicelli ($8.99)
- Beef tripe is used to stir fried with vermicelli
- definitely not my favourite

Fried Mixed Vegetable Noodles ($7.99)
- Ordered especially for our vegetarian dinner mate
- meh, lack the aroma of fresh off  the wok vibe

Tofu Bean Curd Stick and Eggplant ($8.99)
- standard but at least it was nice and hot

Crispy Chicken ($18.99)
- Best dish of the night!! One of the best crispy chicken I ate
- The skin was deep fried to crispiness and the meat still so juicy and tender
- I might just go back for this one!

Purple Rice Sweet Soup (Complimentary)
- Served lukewarm and not even sweet....
- We didn't even finish half of that

Most of the dishes we ordered were not really that great and some even disappointing. As a Cantonese restaurant it really lacks that fresh of the wok taste. 

The service was not bad just a little indifference. 

Maybe I will come back for dim sum and give it another try. But I definitely not going to be back for dinner..."}
{"text":"Service:
Many posters highlight a 50% off dim sum sale within a time slot. It's a scam. I ordered 4 items a la cart and asked to take a bit of 2 home. Apparently it's written in chinese that all you can eat buffet rules apply for a la carte dim sum and if you leave even a bit of just one item the 50% off does not apply to the entire bill. scammers!

The quality of the food was not good. 

-batter was falling off the fried squid

-no flavour in the pork dumplings, just the sugar in the outer shell

-rice bowls with meat were nothing but rice and 5 thin slices of fatty cheapo chinese sausage. 

-pork and shrimp shao mai was ok, but too much flour."}
{"text":"been here for a few times for the rice noodles w peanut sauce, but will not be coming back ever! i've given them enough chances, but the customer service is the worst i've ever had, and the food doesn't taste good anymore like they are not even trying to improve. Stay away, for your own good."}
{"text":"Came here at night and tried their fuzhouness dishes. Their fuzhouness dishes are very tasty and did not disappoint considering that they also serve dim sum. Their price for the fuzhouness dishes are very reasonable for their portion. Their customer service is also very good. When we were seated, they brought out the tea pot immediately. The food also came out pretty fast. Overall, good food and good service!"}
{"text":"Used to be a regular at this restaurant and come here almost once a week with co-workers for lunch due to the reasonable price point for good quality food.  However, just over the past week, the restaurant has changed their business model completely.  Happy hour is now only 9am-12pm.  This makes it almost impossible to enjoy happy hour pricing for folks who work during the week  (all dishes at $3.30 except for XL dishes).  Regular pricing is now at S ($3.38), M ($4.38), L ($5.38) and XL ($6.98).  On average, a la carte prices have increased about 50% per dish. 
 They are basically forcing patrons to get the all you can eat dim sum at approx. $19 plus tax and tips.  At the same time, the food quality has decreased as well.  I've noticed meats, especially pork ribs (under-cooked) and beef ribs (also under-cooked or too tough) over the last few weeks.  Be warned of the high prices going forward and choose wisely."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. My uncle introduced me to it as he's friends with the owner, and we've been going back ever since.

To me, it's one of the best places for dim sum in the core (it's tied with Kowloon, but cheaper!). We usually avoid coming on the weekends, but we went there last Sunday night for Date Night and had a great meal.

I'm by no means an expert in dim sum, but I know good cooking from bad. I generally judge the place by a few dishes: namely, short ribs, beef omasum and sticky rice. Too often, the shortribs are dry and devoid of the unctuous glory of their potential. Not here! They were soft, moist and so satisfying - easy to eat and enjoy.  The sticky rice was nicely cooked and had lots of filling (I find most places skimp on the meat). The tripe was cooked properly: it had a firm bite, but wasn't shrunk and gooey from overcooking. As a texture person, this is a deal breaker for me.

And do yourself a favour - get the Sesame balls for dessert. They were HUGE. Just let them cool off a bit first, otherwise the molten filling will burn the crap out of your tongue.

They also offer private dining upstairs in two event rooms. COMPLETELY WORTH IT. I'm deathly allergic to lobster, but even their Lobster Tower makes me rethink my addiction to breathing. So tempting...

NOTE:  They offer AYCE dim sum, but make sure you make it very clear before ordering that it's what you want - circle it on the form or something. I didn't and instead was handing a big bill that I wasn't expecting.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed everything and willingly paid full price, but I wish the server had clarified with me first.

On the whole, a stellar place to visit when you're in Chinatown. Did I mention the 1/2 price Dim Sum on weekday mornings?"}
{"text":"If we had been on the first floor, maybe there'd be a higher score. But as it was several dishes were either lukewarm, or cold -- probably due to having to go up in the dumb waiter. Or the fact that they were very busy. Or both. Maybe more waitstaff would be helpful as it took quite a while and repeated requests to get water.

Shrimp & chive dumplings good, as were the chicken feet in house sauce and Sui Mai . Black bean spare ribs, fried sticky rice, & spring rolls just ok. Breaded calamari cold. Wouldn't order the turnip cakes again.

Conclusion: worth another try when we're in the area."}
{"text":"I eat dim sum quite often. Can't get enough of that sho mui with hot mustard and chili combo. Sticky rice is the best as well. I have a few go to dim sum restaurants in the Los Angeles area but I'm quite a bit sad to admit this place kicks their butts. 

Greatest dim sum I've ever had!"}
{"text":"The dim sum was pretty good and offered many different choices.i wouldn't say it was exceptional versus other higher end dim sum places but for the prior, it was fine. 

Standard dim sum dishes offered along with some variant dishes that were pretty good. 

If you are a vegetarian, the choices are good and pretty tasty. I particularly liked the vegetarian Singapore curry noddles. Other fried noodle dishes were average.

I would wait for sitting downstairs which is bright rather than being seated upstairs which is somewhat gloomy. 

Restaurant was average on a whole."}
{"text":"More of a 3.5..
Food was pretty good - decent dimsum in Toronto, and price was fair as well. Almost all dishes are under $5. Brought my boyfriend here who has never had dimsum before and he enjoyed it as well. Would recommend ordering 2-3 dishes per person and you'd already be really full! Just docking off stars because the atmosphere/ambience was not the greatest but kind of what you would expect at dimsum restaurants at this price point. Would go back!"}
{"text":"The service is mediocre, but the dim sum is far better than the other dim sum restaurants in the area. It is usually pretty easy to get a table even on weekends as well. This is my first choice for dim sum in the downtown core."}
{"text":"If theres one thing Chinese people love more than kung-fu, it's dim sum. I mean, even our dear and beloved leader chairman Mao Zadong was known to partake in a shrimp dumping or two before he executed his own people. Saying that this place is one among many dim sum places is like saying Jackie Chan is like one Chinese person among many Chinese people. Sure, he's Chinese, but he's not JUST Chinese. This place stands out among the rest of the people and places that tend to look so alike you'll have a hard time telling who is Chen and who is Cheng. 

Pros: 
+ those fried shrimp rolls tho! Light, crispy, and full of shrimp. 
+ basically any shrimp dish
+ the pepper flavor in the beef short ribs is out of this world. So full of pepper. 
+ hot oil at table. I LOVE hot oil. More than I love hot showers. I think the only thing I would love more would be a shower in hot oil. 
+ reasonably priced. Expect to get full for like 11$.

Cons:
- just OK service. I mean they are chinese, not white, so what can I expect? The only thing worse would be service at a Vietnamese restaurant. 
- hot sauce not that hot. Can I just get some sriracha? 

Overall really good. I'd come back here."}
{"text":"I used to like the food, but I hate the service.

I have been a loyal customer to this place for many years. I used to like the food here. However, for recent visits, the service was VERY BAD.
They got a dim sum special on weekday. So I came on Remembrance Day, which was a weekday. However, when the bill came out, it was not on special. There was no sign in the restaurant, and the waiters did not tell me. If I knew it was not on special, I probably would not come here. Remembrance Day is not a public holiday, and they were charging customers without telling them.
2nd time I went, we order dim sum, but we did not order for tea. I explicitly told them I wanted water only. Then when the bill came out, they charge me for tea. I was like WTF, and the waiter told me the food was cheap, so they were going to charge me for tea. I decided to not tip since they charged me extra. Then when the broke my bill, they took changes directly from friends hand and forced us to tip.
3rd time I went (I don't know why I still went), the waitress messed up my order. She put the wrong order in. I pointed out, and she said she would fix it and we sent the dish back. However, I did not notice on the spot, but I got charged for 2 dishes that she messed up.

TLDR: the waitress is super weird and does not understand customer service. The food is good, but the service is HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"Better experience than last time. I will give this place another try in the future.

The staff this time asked me first if I wanted tea, so I had a chance to refuse that, instead of being forced to pay for it like last time.

But they sat me next at a table that already had other customers, despite other tables being free! I guess they want to reserve them for groups, or for their regulars. Fair enough. Unfortunately, one of the customers smelled like he hasn't showered in a few days, which ruined the appetite a little.

Nonetheless, a small price to pay for small priced food.

Food here is dirt cheap. $2.20 per dish still.

Go for the classic stuff, so you can be sure it'll be edible, like steamed buns."}
{"text":"This place is okay. It's decently clean, and there's plenty of seating. The menu is what you'd expect, except they also have sushi if you're doing AYCE. 

We came here for the à la carte dim sum and ordered Har Gow, Siu Mai, Fen Guo, shrimp/tofu, pork porridge, BBQ pork bun, and the honey pepper ribs. Everything tasted \"okay\", but it was nothing mind blowing."}
{"text":"Been here probably 4-5 times. The food Is cheap, standard dim sum, but nothing to write home about.  The owner really nice especially this one time when I got ayce dim sim. He made sure everything I check off on the menu  came even when I said please no more food.....I didn't want to waste it,  but it just kept coming, towers of dim sum.
 
However last week when I was there it was different story one of the waitress there was pretty rude. It literally look like she was throwing the cutlery at us when she was setting up the table, it was unbelievable. I get it, you hate your job but  please don't brake the dishes and please don't stick your thumbs into our cups......I hope the owner sees this review and does something about his staff and hope the  waitress doesn't poisons me because she recognizes my profile pic."}
{"text":"The restaurant was empty when my friends and i went there for a bite to eat.  We ordered 2 bowls of noodle soups, 1 bowl of fish balls soup, 1 bowl of meat soup, and a plate of fried meat dumplings.  The noodle soup was bland.  However the fish balls soup was flavourful and everyone liked it.  We then decided to order more and went for the meat soup.  We asked the wait staff what kind of meat it was, and they said pork.   It didn't taste like pork to us.  We termed it mysterious meat.  The plate of meat dumplings were tasty and everyone enjoyed it.  The cost was pretty good.  After dividing the total between 6 of us, each had to pay only $5!!!!
The service however, was weird.  The wait staff pretty much ignored us the whole time.  They were more engrossed in their conversation.  On top of that they were so loud that we could barely hear ourselves talking!!  What took me by surprise was that one of them suddenly swore in mandarin.  I am still shock whenever i think about that evening at Rosewood."}
{"text":"Usually, when it comes to dim sum I like it cheap and dirty or high-end and fancy schmancy. This place falls somewhere in the middle, and i can see this being ideal for many folks. 

We had a party of six, and sat upstairs at a round table complete with a Lazy Susan. Looove me a Lazy Susan. We over ordered by a mile, but most of the buns, soups, dumplings and fried rice were delicious. They do the leaf wrapped sticky rice, too, which is a favourite in my camp. 

The downside is the drink situation. They have a few of the most horrible wines available at the LCBO, and they brought two bottles over. One was the display wine, complete with bow, that was just off from being under a light. Aside from watching friends drink purple vinegar, this was a pretty decent dim sum experience."}
{"text":"Boy, oh boy, did this place ever satisfy my dim sum cravings. I came here with a group for our reservation at 12:30pm. We ordered a bunch of dim sum items that came so quickly! Like within 10 minutes. We got har gow, siu mai, chicken feet, scallion and ginger tripe, steamed beef balls on peas, grilled chicken and corn cakes, shrimp rice rolls, amongst other items and everything was so delicious, hot, and fresh. It also was ayce for dim sum & sushi which is amazing! It was $19.99/person for lunch which is a great deal. I think that lunch rate is only for Mondays-Thursdays. Highly recommended when you want to eat great dim sum and have fast service!"}
{"text":"The dim sum here is amazing.  $23 on weekdays $26 weekends (includes sushi sushi on weekends).

Huge portions of noodles and other entrees not just small plates.  
Careful, it is very easy to over order! And easy to finish it all and waddle our in pain from stomach ripping open... cause the food is so delicious. 

Very quick service, friendly and cute staff. 
Very Authentic cuisine for those who are adventurous with trying different Chinese foods. Everything from siu mai to pork intestine and chicken feet. Yum yum.

The best part is that it is the only acte dim sum dt Toronto AND It is open till late night so you can actually order AYCE dim sum after 2pm! 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Dim sum more in my mouth. 
This place was very clean and had a more upscale feel to a dim sum joint, since most of the time you're getting metal framed chairs with red cushions and a white tablecloth. Decor was nice. Place was busy, fairly busy on a Saturday afternoon.
It's not the type of place that has carts being pushed all around that you can choose from (at the time that I was at, anyways). We were given a menu with pictures which was very helpful! 
The dumplings here are a great size. Hefty, not skimping on the meat. Fried squid came out piping hot, not greasy. Loved the shrimp fried in bean curd wrapping, the crisped buns that look like white hockey pucks seated on each side. The filling in that was so simple but really flavorful, scallion, ginger and pork.
Only caveat here is service, but that's really no different than any other of these places. Had to ask for water instead of it being standard. You've got to flag people down when you want to order- or finish a dish and then order when they come to pick it up!"}
