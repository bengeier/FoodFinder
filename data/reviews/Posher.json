{"text":"This place is new and it's Amazing. Decor is definitely trendy. Must see for yourself. Food was awesome and portions were quite generous.  Staff was nice and friendly. Will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Laissez moi commencer par le décor celui-ci m'a franchement impressionné, moderne chic et rustique à la fois ''its so fancy'' Le personnel du restaurant à une petite allée qui leur est complètement réservé, Ce qui rend plus facile le déplacement avec les boissons et les plats. De plus, vos bouteilles de sake qui ne sont pas terminées sont suspendus au plafond et conserver jusqu'à votre prochaine visite. Quelle ingéniosité! 

J'ai commencé la soirée avec le rollercoaster un heureux mélange de Baileys, vodka et de bleuets congelés, trop bon! J'ai été agréablement surprise de découvrir que le goût de leur plats est à la hauteur de leur présentation. 0uff! Je me suis laissé tenté par les Hosomaki syake tempura et le Maki poulet tereyaki, Je n'ai pas regretté mon choix. 
Leur personnel est présent,  chaleureux et efficace. POSHER est Situé à 1 min du metro Côte des neiges, l' endroit est accesible et parfait pour une soirée entre amis ou en couple. Vous aurez une ambiance resto lounge avec de la bonne musique pour accompagner la soirée. Pour ce qui est du prix, très abordable. Bref! Il faut l'essayer.

**Avis aux végétariens** Cet endroit est aussi pour vous."}
{"text":"Magnifique décor et excellent service, par contre  le menu est un copier coller du sushi shop ( même noms, même ingrédients). Somme toute c'était bon, seulement un manque d'originalité au niveau du menu."}
{"text":"I was an usual costumer but I won't buy anoymore from this place. I always order a vege poke bowl and the last time I ordered one and I was very disappointed. The veggies and edamame were not fresh at all. I got wasabi instead of avocado (No mention of wasabi in the menu, it was supposed to be avocado). I also got no red onions and no sauce. Honestly I used to recommend this place to my friends, but I won't anymore."}
{"text":"The sushi is excellent but they put too much rice in it. Poke bowl did not have green onions as advertised (how can poke not have green onions?) Student Waiters/waitresses, very inexperienced, very insecure and nervous, don't hear your order well (very poor communication) and there seems to be a high turnover. Their formal dress with white shirts and bowties is more pretentious than appealing. They walk by you all the time and lurk around you as you eat, which is annoying."}
{"text":"As I'm writing this review, I think of the other sushi places I've been to and can't stop myself from comparing. 

This place has been open for 3-4 months. And it was not busy on a Thursday between 5 and 6h20. To be exact the restaurant could have been a third of the space and still not be full. They have an interesting seating arrangement that allow the waitress to deliver to any places without having people in the way except for the 4 table in the front which is where they sit people first.

The service is friendly. No issues there. The quality of the food is ok but not the best I've had. We went there on a Groupon but did look at the a la carte menu. The prices seems a bit high except for the poke bowls.

In summary, if you are in the area and are looking for a sushi place, it's worth the try. But if you are not in the area, it's not worth the detour. As for me, since This is not on my way to anywhere, I doubt that I will go again."}
{"text":"New sushi resto opened up on cote des neiges! Found out about this place from a groupon. The groupon is worth it but a la carte is a bit pricey. The interior is similar to big in Japan bar idea so not really authentic but there is nothing like this in the neighbourhood so it does stand out"}
{"text":"Cool sushi / poke place on Cote-Des-Neiges! 
Posher offers a diverse menu ranging from sushi to salads and poke bowls. I was impressed by how fresh the ingredients are and by how delicious all the different dishes are. The portions are quite large so don't be shy to ask for a take-away container at the end of your meal! The restaurant has an interesting layout and minimalist decor. Overall, cool place for fresh sushi or poke in CDN."}
{"text":"Great place foods awesome , poke bowl has about too much rice I would say the sushi rolls are good portions for snacks"}
{"text":"Ordered the tuna and salmon poke bowl. The crispy rice was a good choice. Very generous portion. Taste is average.
The place looks nice: Tables make a very efficient formation."}
{"text":"Good restaurant. Good ambiance. Nice decor. The waitresses were really kind. 8/10 for the food. Recommand"}
{"text":"Service was terribly slow, even when the restaurant was empty. I had to go get a waitress to get seated. They didn't even serve water when we came in. 

They don't label things that they ran out. 

When the food came, they didn't bring utensils. I had to go to their counter to get it myself. There was no bowl either. 

Food was quite expensive for what they provide. 

The indoor decor is very nice. I will give them points for that. But I am not coming back here."}
{"text":"The place was completely empty on a sunny Sunday afternoon, which is a bit of a shame as the food was really nice - not great, but very nice.
I had a miso soup that could have used a bit more salt or spice, followed by the tuna tataki. The latter was great - the tuna nicely marinated and seasoned just right.
The staff was very attentive, but then I was the only customer."}
{"text":"J'ai bc aimé la décoration ici et les plats sont trop bon! Et sashimi est toujours mon préféré, délicieux et frais"}
