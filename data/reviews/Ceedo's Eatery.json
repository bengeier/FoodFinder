{"text":"Went to Ceedos last night and had fabulous food. Baba ghanoush, shish kebab and baklava. All wonderful. We talked to the owner/chef and his son-in-law, both very pleasant and anxious to please. They do a lot of catering and carry out with an extensive menu of Mediterranean food. It's nothing fancy but the food is so good the ambience can easily be ignored."}
{"text":"Super friendly,food is great and the specials are exceptional. I'm a huge fan of middle eastern food and Ceedo's is my new go to,totally worth the drive for me."}
{"text":"Might be the best place I've ever eaten . Came for dinner, left with the $100 worth of food for leftovers. Super nice staff! This best in Ohio"}
{"text":"Very disappointing!!  Our party of 6 chose Ceedo's based on the 4 1/2 star rating to have good Mediterranean food.  The hummus seemed to be watered down, spinach pie was dried out, the meat was cold in two of the dishes, and they didn't serve tap water - you had to buy bottled water.  All drinks were bottled and many were passed the pull date!! The only good thing about our visit was the service was excellent.  The owner even gave us a special little dessert."}
{"text":"This is first review I have ever left for a restaurant. I usually just use yelp selfishly looking at other people's recommendations while never leaving any of my own. Ceedo's is the first place I have ever gone to where I felt compelled to leave a review because there food really is so top notch. I got the lamb burger and it was crazy good. I will definitely be returning soon...and often."}
{"text":"Food was fine but I knocked off 1 star because they force customers who just want water to buy bottled water.  We travel a lot and this is the first time a restaurant in the U.S. has ever done this.  The other star was deducted because we were charged an extra $1 for the french fries my husband got even though the menu said pita chips or fries were included.  My husband questioned this and was told \"We charge $1 extra for fries.\"  They need to change their menu if they want to charge extra for the fries.  It is also the first Mediterranean restaurant I have been to that does not serve hummus with their pita chips."}
{"text":"Ceedo's has delicious, fresh food and a very friendly staff.  They cater to our children whenever we visit, making special dessert treats and chatting with them.  Even though they only have a few tables and their business is primarily take-out, they frequently check on us during the meal."}
{"text":"I am a frequent visitor of this establishment and they always deliver a great experience. My wife loves the lamb burger which is always cooked perfectly. The meat is full of flavor and the sauce is tangy and compliments the sandwich well. It is accompanied by crispy fries which are delicious. I like the chicken dish which is served with rice. The chicken is packing a lot of Mediterranean flavor while the rice is always cooked perfectly.   I have tried other dishes at Ceedos and they all deliver a great amount of flavor. I would also recommend the kabobs, humus, and kibble.  When you go, talk to the chefs. They are very personable and make you feel apart of the passion that they put into their food.  I recommend that you try this place and take full advantage of the dishes that are thoughtfully prepared."}
{"text":"I tried this place because I have driven past it many times and was curious about it. I ordered the chicken shawarma and hummus. The chicken sandwich came with french fries, which I didn't really want. However, when I got home and tried them, I was glad they were in there! They have a coating on them that is similar to Rally's Fries and they were delicious! My chicken and hummus were really good as well. I will go back the next time I'm in the mood for Middle Eastern food!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Groupon,  Food is fresh and well seasoned with middle eastern spices.  We had the kabob platter and lamb shank - they were both big portions and done just right.   Humus and Tabouli were great too.  Ceedo is a very cool guy to talk to as well - he is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Recommended by some friends in Cleveland as a place to check out Middle Eastern fare in the Falls area. Purchased a Groupon that was running, the details below.  Food [C] I'm a huge fan of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food. There's something about the spices that come together so well. Having known about Ceedo's by word of mouth as well as from the excellent reviews here on Yelp, I was really excited to see a Groupon available to try out the place. Unfortunately, I got my hopes up. The overall seasoning for the food was quite bland. For an appetizer, I was curious about the Mediterranean spring rolls since I wasn't familiar with them, which was a big mistake. The spring rolls are essentially spinach+feta cheese, fried in a thick pastry served with a generically sweet sauce. It did not contain much of the flavor profile I was seeking. Keeping up my optimism, we ordered the lamb kabob (standard fare) and some quail. Alas, the entrees did not deliver the redemption I had hoped for. The lamb kabob was overcooked, tough, and very unseasoned. The quail was burnt on too many sides and served with excessive oil. The rice and sides were forgettable.   Service [C] Orders are taken without issue. Food is brought out. No real complaints, except when the final check came out. When I inquired about the discrepancy, the manager/owner (?) came over and started adding stipulations to limit the true value of the Groupon purchased (these conditions were not described in the actual Groupon offer itself), which led to a higher bill than expected. Nothing exorbitant in the end, however, the manner in which the bill was explained and taken was a bit brusque.  Ambiance [C] It's essentially a cafeteria. Nothing to write home about.  All in all, a less than pleasant experience, with mediocre food and some lack of courtesy which left a sour aftertaste."}
{"text":"The food here is terrific. Every dish I've tried has been very flavorful and filling. The service is above and beyond expectations. Ask for koshary!"}
{"text":"Very delicious Mediterranean cuisine,  it's one of the best restaurants in the area.  I went there with my family and we enjoyed eating the food there very much. The restaurant is clean (not so fancy) and the service was very good and friendly.   Moreover, it is a family restaurant and they have all kinds of grills. Also, the taste of the food sticks in your mind. I highly recommend it, and definitely I will go there again!"}
{"text":"This was such a good eat! My mom and her sisters and my brother and father picked this up for dinner and as we are all Lebanese women we weren't disappointed. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"These are the kindest people! They will cook whatever you want and when you want it. I think they really enjoy feeding people! I don't eat meat and they cater to me. Their rice is the best, but they have many options!!!"}
{"text":"What a delicious experience! Ali, his daughter, and son-in-law, keep a very clean and welcoming restaurant! My eyes were drawn to the dessert case that carries such treats as baklava, mango mousse pie, tiramisu, and much more! Cooler contains pretty much any beverage you could want. I ordered the lamb burger with seasoned fries, and the sauce was great! Burger came out fresh, quick, and hot! My daughter ordered the house salad and meat fatayar. We were not disappointed. I will definitely come here again. Many reviews comment on the lamb shank, and I must say that I saw a couple lamb takeouts while there, so I will try next time!"}
{"text":"We had a couple best-evers: best pita chips and best gyro.  Omg. Can't wait to go back. Friendly & family run and owned."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I highly recommend the appetizer sampler and hummus. The inside of the restaurant isn't very fancy but it's a great little spot for a quick meal or take out."}
{"text":"I go to this place once a week and haven't been disappointed yet, they have the best rice in town! Yep that's right better than wasabi! I usually get the grilled quail and rice but there gyros are hard to turn down. Love this place great food at cheap prices."}
{"text":"I love good and authentic Mediterranean food. This is some of the best Mediterranean food I have ever had.Tonight was my first visit, the food is excellent, the owner is charming and will accommodate special orders. The sampler platter had baba ghanouj, tabouli, grape leaves and spinach pie, I HIGHLY recommend. They had a huge selection and the owner let me know they are accommodating to vegetarians, so we will definitely be back. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Always a fan of the chicken salad. It's very large. The grape leaves are wonderful but overpriced. The service is usually meh, overbearing or rude depending on the day. I do like the food, and I stop in every few months or so. I suggest getting it to go"}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in on a whim, greeted with friendly fast service, amazing food and generous portions. I had the lamb kabob skillet wife had the  beef. both cooked perfectly. plenty of delicious rice and veggies."}
{"text":"Excellent food, everything we ordered was great. They had the best fries I've had in a long time! The dining area was tiny, but clean and quiet.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great new shop, super fresh food.   Open kitchen and super friendly staff.  Food is quite delicious and fast, and the prices are reasonable.  The food was good enough I had to add this business to Yelp so I could leave a review."}
{"text":"Excellent house salad with grilled chicken that had delicious, light, citrus dressing. Falafel was super and had a nice tang of lemon on the wrap. The French fries were out of this world! Crispy and perfectly cooked. Restaurant could be cleaner."}
{"text":"What I loved: -Lentil soup (which had chickpeas, potatoes, spinach and garnished with feta). This was the best lentil soup I've had in a long time -Flavors -Authentic food -Service  What could be better: -Much of what we ordered were deep fried (and not baked), thus making it much greasier than necessary. This included the spinach pie and pita chips. -The lamb shawarma was decent but not as seasoned as many other shawarma shops, so the flavor was there but much toned down -The spinach pie had more dough than spinach. Very tasty otherwise, and I enjoyed the sprinkled feta on top. -Limited selection of drinks. The waters are bottled waters."}
{"text":"The pita chips are delicious!! Always fresh, and the seasoning on them is so yummy you hardly need dip, although the hummus is a good choice. The falafel pita is so so but there's not a lot of vegetarian options here so that's usually my go to. Its still good! I just wish they had more meatless options."}
{"text":"So.. I'm kind of bummed about this place. We called in a take-out order for 1/2 chicken dinner, beef kabob dinner, 2 orders of falafel and a large baba ganoosh. My boyfriend called it in, so I wasn't sure how much it was meant to cost. When I got there, I told them that I had called in an order, and the guy looked at me strangely and then said he had forgotten he'd made that order (this was 15 mins after we called it in). I paid what they told me to and was given a tied-up bag. When I got home, I found that we hadn't gotten the 1/2 chicken dinner or the second order of falafel (both of which were mine). We weren't charged for it, either, but.. My boyfriend gets to eat dinner now and I'm stuck picking at the appetizers.   The falafel is really good.. Possibly the best I've had. Very moist and flavorful. The baba ganoosh isn't my favorite.. Has a smokey flavor to it, but not much else. Not bad, but not great. Boyfriend likes his beef kabob dinner, and I tried some of his rice and it's pretty good. Wish I had more to say about this place, as we ordered because of all the rave reviews from Yelpers. Maybe they're just having an off night, but... I'm hungry."}
{"text":"Love this place! Originally found this place through Groupon and have gone back several times! The food is consistently good, the restaurant isn't fancy by any means but the food makes up for it!!  The owner is very friendly and the prices are very reasonable"}
{"text":"I think the employees are very nice. I was disappointed with my $11.90 (chicken) salad and mango cheese cake. I felt the price and quality of the food were not compatible.  The salad dressing and salad lacked flavor and had a pungent smell."}
{"text":"This little place was fantastic. Got the lamb burger and I was not disappointed. Sat and talked with the owner while my food was being prepared and he was awesome. Very personable and he really seems to care about what he does. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a quick lunch after apartment hunting and it was perfect, yummy, fast and fresh. We had a quick conversation with the owner and his server and settled on falafel sandwiches and a small fattoush salad-the salad, was fantastic. Nice light pita chips and well dressed. The falafel itself was soft and not greasy, I've gotten used to pickled veggies in my sandwiches so I would have liked that but they put a pickle on the side so good enough! People around us seemed to be enjoying extensive racks of ribs and before I left I saw a cezva being carried by with beautiful glass coffee cups--I will be back for that coffee. People had scared me about dining options in Ohio but I think I will be just fine :)"}
{"text":"Terrific restaurant. The menu is great but you should ask Ali the chef for his off menu items! Whether its Beef Wellington or Hawawshi, the off menu items are off the charts! The Cornish hen and the kafta kebabs are also must trys. Excellent food overall and a very friendly staff."}
{"text":"The lamb shank was amazingly good, super clean kitchen and friendly staff. I will be back."}
{"text":"Ceedo's Eatery is a small place, but filled with big bold flavors. My friend and I ordered the grape leaves, fatayar, tabouli, meat pies, and kibbeh. Everything was delicious, especially the tabouli and meat pies! The pita bread paired well with the fresh and earthy tabouli. The flavors of the meat pies, filled with ground chuck and not lamb, were perfect and hit just the right spot! One thing I do have to point out is the fact that the grape leaves seemed to be on the saltier side. From my friend's perspective, it normally has more of a lemon flavor and is not as salty. I'm not sure if grape leaves are usually that salty, but these ones were a little disappointing. Overall though, Ceedo's was a good Mediterranean experience!"}
{"text":"Could be one of the best eateries in the area. It's a pleasant experience every time. It is very basic but also very clean. The service is exceptionally friendly. They have a great selection of canned soda- Fanta Zero for me! Their hummos is fabulous! The oil they use is something from heaven. One bite and you'll know what I mean. Their fattoush is very, very good. The fallafel is to die for! Next time I will have them hold some of the onion, but other than that, it was amazing!   This place is so damn good- trust me."}
{"text":"My experience with Ceedos has been excellent. You can't go wrong with the Black Angus or the lamb shank. I've tried most of their in house specialities and have never been disappointed. Moving out of the area soon, and I will say with confidence that I will miss eating here the most!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the stuffed grape leaves! My husband got the lamb kabob skillet that was fantastic as well. Great tabouleh and hummus. My mother in law got the appetizer platter as her meal. I had a gyro and it was delicious. Large portions and excellent flavor. Everyone was delighted with what they ate. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Mediterranean eateries I have been in a long time. Wonderful staff gave us some great reccommendations for food.  The sampler platter was fantastic, great hummus and the spinach pie was amazing.  For my entree, I'm not sure what it's called but I included a picture. Incredible! Perfect chicken with amazing seasoning. The flat bread was perfectly done with almond and onions, I thought it was an interesting combination at first but the taste was superb!!  5 starts."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have received two excellent meals. This place is a treasure! I will definitely be here for lunch every Friday."}
{"text":"At first glance, Ceedo's looks like your average quick mediterranean place, but take a closer look at their menu, and it's clear to see that they're a step above. While their gyros are great, I encourage you to try one of their daily specials or one or entrees. The lamb shank I tried was fall off the bone tender, and so affordably priced! The owners and employees here are also very sweet and obviously care a lot about what they do, so it's a great local business to support!"}
{"text":"Simple place, and the sandwiches are okay. The shawarmas are fresh, but the spice in them is not standard and leans more toward bitter than bold flavor. I usually stop by for lunch, but next time i would like to try their specialty plates which are dinner options, those sound spot on. The spinach and meat pies are really great. It is king of inconvenient that they sell drinks by the bottle/can."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim about an hour prior to closing, owner was extremely friendly, and food was wonderful and fresh!!!! Some of the best Mediterranean Food I have ever had. The grape leaves were beyond compare."}
{"text":"One word - YUM! Very good food! Pescatarian and Vegetarian friendly! Had the tuna, spring rolls and grape leaves! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy food with several vegetarian options, I liked the lentil soup! The seating area is small and the restaurant seems more take-out oriented, but dine in service is still good."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews on Yelp, I decided to try the lamb shank and was not disappointed!  Great flavor, and the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender.  It came with rice and potatoes, and was a ton of food so I barely finished half of it.  Staff were very nice and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Fast, Fresh and delicious.  I ordered the lamb shank and the small appetizer platter to share.  Fantastic.  Humus, awesome.  Tabouli, great. Falafal, crispy and delicious. Meat pies, OMG! Lamb fell off the bone  (as it should).  Other tablemates(my wife) plan on writing their own reviews so I will leave that to her.  Very happy we tried this restaurant.  We will be back."}
{"text":"There are plenty of seats and tables, but this isn't a traditional sit down kinda place. If you order a soft drink, it's a can, and if you want water, you have to buy it bottled.  I got the falafel panini sandwich and it was absolutely delicious. I'd order it again, and will probably be craving it all week now. They use fresh pita and grill it, so it's. Ice and crispy. The veggies and tahini sauce in the sandwich along with the falafel are perfect. The rice for a $1 up-charge was really good too. Mmmmm  I got the sandwich, rice and a bottled water for less than $10. I'll be back.  Update: I went back. And it was awesome again. I decided to try the Koufta panini wrap, and I think I liked it even more than the falafel. The beef had so much flavor. I tried the hummus too and it was really good. Way different than the hummus you buy in the grocery store. It had a great olive oil/garlic taste. The pita bread that came with it wasn't my favorite but I'd still order the hummus again."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from Ceedos for the first time tonight. I thought the fries were just okay. Good, but nothing special ( i ordered them without the seasoning)  The gyro is delish. Cucumber sauce hits the spot. I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I was delighted by the quality of the food. The soup was so delicious. The lamb shank was unreal. They were extremely nice and friendly, too. I will definitely visit here again."}
{"text":"Delicious food at a very affordable price. Look forward to going again. The hummus is really good and the shish kabobs were awesome."}
{"text":"I ate here quite awhile ago and forgot to write a review.  Food was very good, generous servings.  Authentic and genuine Mediterranean food.  I had the chicken shish kabob."}
{"text":"The best place to eat mouthwatering tender,full of flavour kebabs. Homely ambiance, food quality is great. Must visit!"}
{"text":"Finally a good Mediterranean restaurant in the Stow area. The mrs. had a gyro (they even pronounce it yee-roh). They make their own gyro meat and it was delicious...first time we've said that in Ohio. I had the chicken shishkabob. Meat was slightly overdone but very flavorful. Authentic mint tea was delicious. Now hopefully they'll get enough business so they can upgrade the ambience. That kind of food deserves to be eaten in a nicer atmosphere. Kudos to the chefs."}
{"text":"Ceedo's is not a fancy upscale eatery. Its a casual eatery that mainly focuses in take out. The food is incredible. Should you chose to dine in the family that runs it is amazingly nice. Each one of them plays a role in the eatery. Each one of them remembers you. Specials every day usually unique and stuff you cannot find anywhere else. When you eat in you can select drinks from their cooler. They do not have a drink tower. These people know the food they cook well. The head chef has worked all over the world and has enough training to make some five star restaurants blush. I can't say enough positive about this place. If your not already eating there your missing out."}
{"text":"Go big or go home is not the style of this place. The good food is lost in the cafeteria-style setting. The owner would do better in a full service restaurant... and maybe get a pop machine instead of a pop can cooler."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Shared the appetizer special-falafel excellent, tabouli really really good, hummus awesome, hot sauce and garlic sauce were out of this world! For the meal we shared stuffed Cornish hen on bed of maklouba rice. The stuffing in the hen was meat/rice mixture which had a very distinct spice flavor. Tasty, but not my favorite. The bed of maklouba rice was so delicious!  The ambiance is very simple- a few tables but nothing fancy. I'd say it's more take out. No water served unless you buy a bottle.  We didn't order dessert, but the server brought us a little treat anyway- small pastry shell stuffed with sweet cream, topped with a blackberry and a mint leaf. Delish. Their other dessert selections are all homemade and look very tasty. Seriously, I've eaten Turkish, Lebanese, Jordanian, made by great home cooks and I'd say this is the best I've had. I cannot wait to go back. This place is worth a special trip. Please don't miss out on the chance to enjoy this authentic and wonderfully prepared food. Oh, I bought large containers of tabouli and hummus with hot sauce to go!!!"}
{"text":"Ceedo's Eatery has AMAZING Mediterranean dishes that could convince me to come here everyday!!! The service is excellent as well! You cannot be disappointed by this place! It's healthy AND delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"So so good!!!   Food is fresh.  It tastes amazing.  The owner and employees are super nice.   Such a great option in a town with so many fast food and chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Ceedo's catered a company lunch event for us. The food was great, timing was punctual, and the service was exceptional. It was a great success. I would definitely recommend Ceedo's catering."}
{"text":"Simply awesome Mediterranean place. We were hungry for something lighter, but not salads, so we went in search of just that. I'm a lover of all things hummus and this didn't disappoint. I had the sample platter as my meal with hummus, tabouli, spinach pie, grape leaves, and falafel. All was super flavorful. I will say that this food as compared to med I've had in the past had a little more lemon flavor along with more tastes of vinegar. But it was all fabulous.  My husband had a chicken dish on flatbread recommended by the owner and chef. Literally fall off the bone, but seasoned and crispy on the outside. Yummmmm.  It was slow when we came in and the guys there were super personable and welcoming. Just a great customer experience overall. They told us when we were there that they are now serving breakfast/brunch on the weekends. If I lived close by, I would ABSOLUTELY try it out. Middle eastern folks are known for their love and attention to detail in food. This place does not disappoint."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a coworker. I was impressed from the moment I called and placed the Togo order! The guy who answered the phone was nice and made sure he had the order correct. When we got there it was very well kept and clean, it has an open kitchen concept where you can see your food being prepared. I highly suggest getting a dessert as well. We got to meet the owner and he was super friendly and helpful. And the food was amazing!  My husband loved his gyro. I had the meat pies and we shared kibbie. Everything was cooked perfectly!  We definitely have found a new favorite and it's very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Ceedo's.... your place for the real deal of Mediterranean.... I'm in town on assignment, and was in the mood for something GOOD and healthy... this place was right by my hotel... I walked in, took a big inhale, and ordered more food than I was able to eat in one sitting... I walked out with Kibbe, Falafel, Meat Pies, Hummus, and a Shawarma sandwich... The flavor on everything was outstanding!! I tried to eat it all... really... but wound up saving the meat pies for dinner the next night, and half the Shawarma for lunch the next day... Even the next day, the flavors still held true... Mediterranean food is part of my diet, to include parts of the Middle East, and Ceedo's choices for spices brings you to those regions... very spot-on....   Go, have your feast... you won't be disappointed...."}
{"text":"A beautiful job. Authentic Mediterranean food appreciate the owner's quick service and complimentary appetizer. I would come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"tldr; whole roast lamb catering, strip mall digs, hella fantastic food.   First time in. While we were getting seated, a guy at the counter getting takeout explained that his wife made him drive from Cleveland to pick up food. \"Maybe she's pregnant\" we thought.   Well.  Pregnant or not, Girl has good taste.  We started with the stuffed grape leaves which were doused in a lemony-garlicky-spicy vinaigrette, and the baba ghanoush which was smokey and creamy and came drizzled with a quality olive oil.  I shared the lamb tagine special with couscous ($16 and more than enough for two with generous leftovers) which was a lamb shank cooked just enough to fall apart but still taste deeply of lamb, on top of really savory flavorful couscous. My table also had the lamb burger which was juicy enough to fall into the \"wet burrito knife and fork\" category, and the garden salad which was (and I'm including Michelin Star) one of the prettiest vegetable dishes I've seen in a while.   As we were leaving, my dad asked about the \"whole lamb catering\" which is pretty much his new obsession in life. Apparently Creedos will go and obtain a kosher lamb, and stuff it, and roast it, and provide salad and rice and hummus for your party of 25 for $250.   People. I've spent more at McDonald's (per person).  Go to Creedo's. Talk to the Chef. Eat the food. Guaranteed you'll leave happy."}
{"text":"Really good Greek food. Fries are delicious. The chicken is fantastic. I love the rice too. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My favorite Mediterranean restaurant. Better than Aladdin's. Great menu. Hard to choose what to order!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a concert and found this place on yelp - was well reviewed so we gave it a try.  Good choice on our part.  Everything from my lamb burger to our lentil soup were notably delicious. Prices were very affordable and staff was very welcoming and friendly. This is by no means a fine dining experience but for a quick stop-in location for lunch it was 5-stars perfect."}
{"text":"When I walked in the restaurant, the man behind the counter was on his cell phone with a personal call. When I ordered my food, he went right from the register to the grill without putting on gloves or washing his hands. I could see him using tongs but the second person cooking was also not wearing gloves. I ordered the gyro which had well seasoned meat but the tomatoes were old and not fresh. The meat wasn't even on a traditional spit but instead was in a warming pan which didn't give it the traditional flavor and texture I was hoping for. I had read so many great reviews and was pretty disappointed in the meal and wouldn't recommend this place to others. I have no intention of eating here again."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff!  Food is ethnic (which I was aware) so I stayed safe with the lamb burger!  The lamb burger was good however spicy (northern MN Norwegian taste buds) for my liking, which I was able to over look do to the friendly staff!   Thank you for the experience."}
