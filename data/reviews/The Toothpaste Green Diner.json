{"text":"Wow! Went to my neighbourhood's newest diner, and I couldn't be more disappointed. The food was really bad. Burgers, fries and a Coke. Pretty simple I thought. Who knew they don't know how to cook a simple meal? The food was not cooked and when I mentioned it should be cooked more they went ballistic. The owner was quite rude. Dirty and ignorant. Goodbye, Not coming back. Lucky there is a pizza place next door."}
{"text":"This place has great potential. I like the decor, though no toothpaste I've seen is that colour. They have a refurbished old espresso machine which was cool. The portions are large. The music was top 40 from 10 years ago, which is not to my taste, and seemed out of keeping with the decor, but that is kinda cool. The staff seem like awesome folks, and quite interesting, but were distracted more than the almost empty diner required.   I did not have a good experience. Though there were only two other tables, no one greeted me when I arrived or  spoke to me for a couple of minutes, even though they were right there. I ordered the breakfast special, with coffee and a glass of water. I was given a bottle of water, no big deal I suppose. The coffee was undrinkable, it seemed to be burnt. I asked for over medium eggs but I got so over easy the egg was barely cooked, the bacon seemed under cooked, but no more than other places. No one cleaned my table which had dirty napkins from a previous guest.  And no one asked me how my food was or why I did not touch my coffee. The home fries were cooked well and I got about a pound of them.   I think with a little time and effort this place could be 5-star. The nice staff seemed to be oblivious to basic standards of customer service, and did not make the effort to ensure quality food and drink. I hope they read this review and step up. These things are easy to fix, they already have a priceless x-factor which is a charm and authentic style with no trace of anything hipster. Making fresh coffee, saying hello when people enter, asking how the meal was is an easy fix.   I will hit it again in a few weeks and hopefully rave."}
