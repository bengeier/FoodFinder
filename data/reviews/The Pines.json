{"text":"Always a great place to have family night and guaranteed to get full.  Its not 5 star but good food for Madison.  Salad bar, prime rib,catfish,and soups are recommended"}
{"text":"Great meal. Don't judge a book by it's cover. This place isn't the newest or real fancy but was really impressed. The salad bar was better than most with 8 to 10 different items besides the usual potato salad and such. Even pimento cheese spread. The hot bar had the usual comfort foods. Really liked the fried fish with homemade tarter sauce. Broccoli cheese casserole was great. But was REALLY impressed how they didn't skip at the carving station on the prime rib. Most places give you a tiny little slice that's gone in 2 bites. This gal sawed off a big thick slab that was all I could eat! Not the big lavish spread like Golden Coral but I enjoyed it a lot more."}
{"text":"I had a so-so meal here.  I had the lunch buffet and only took food from the warm section.  I had mashed red potatoes , fish,  corn, carrots and fried chicken.  The chicken was very moist if a little salty.  The rest of the meal was bland and tired.  My wife did enjoy the salad bar and the coffee was pretty good.  We didn't cruise the dessert section. My father in-law loves this place.  He had a full plate of salad and then a full plate from the hot buffet."}
