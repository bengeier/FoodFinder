{"text":"Service was really bad.  Failed to let us know the daily specials, took really long to be served, wrong food was served.We shared food and plates weren't changed between dishes despite we order octopus first and a meat entree. Finally, my own napkin was used to clean some food on the table. Food wasn't a hot. Portions aren't that generous and lack presentation. The price is high for the good and service. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Best quality Greek dishes on the Danforth. Variety of dishes changes daily in the steam trays."}
{"text":"Fantastic friendly service and loved the moussaka!   They grill their pita bread also, improves the flavor!  They can accommodate lots of large groups at once...lots of room"}
{"text":"The food and service was really good. We had the grilled octopus, a Greek salad and the lamb shiskabobs and the food was very tasty and not over cooked. We would definitely go back. Prices were fair and we felt it was good value for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Me and my family have been enjoying greek food on the Danforth for a number of years and we were pleasantly surprised to discover this place. The atmosphere is friendly, service is quick and the food is fantastic. We love their regular menu options as well as their daily special which are always delicious. We even love bringing our young son here as they always have a special treat for him. Portions are large and worth the value. You will not be disappointed. This is our go to Greek restaurant and eat here a least once a month!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Loved that the owner welcomed me at the door and showed me all the daily specials not on the menu! Prompt, friendly service by all staff and excellent food! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Yia Yia would be proud.  The food is the best in Greektown.  I make a trip whenever I'm in town, traveling on business."}
{"text":"We hadn't planned to have dinner at Anestis, but we're happy that we did!  Service was great; our server was super friendly and the owner was too, making sure that we were taken care of.  We ordered the kilo of lamp chops which is great deal. $60 for 4 people; 3 each for $15 you can't get better than that. They were very juicy and everything tasted exquisitely.   Highly recommend!! Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Thank you, Yelpers.  You helped out of town tourists pick this Greek place from so many along Danforth in Toronto.  An after dinner stroll confirmed that not only was the food divine, but the atmosphere beat out so many other places we passed as well.  A great choice.  The friendly owner George takes pride in his cooking and in making sure his patrons feel like guests.  He stopped by our table several times to make sure all was well after we were served the two main dishes from so many excellent choices: stuffed zucchini in lemon sauce and freshly grilled sea bream.  From the lightly dressed salad greens to the (unexpected) baklava treat on the house, there wasn't an off note in anything that passed our lips.  Fresh food, lightly seasoned, clearly made not only with love but with a perfect touch of flavor and the finest of ingredients.  This is the best Greek meal we've had in North America!  And wonderful atmosphere in the restaurant too -- bright, light, clean, and a huge patio for those ready to dine al fresco.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this charming restaurant while walking along the Danforth.  First impressions, it's a fresh new addition to the Danforth strip.  The restaurant is very Greek-esque, think about Mykonos with all the beautiful white walls, blue doors and brightly coloured furniture.    We walked in to just take a look at the menu.  We were greeted by what I think to be the owner, he was extremely friendly and was so eager to show us some of the daily specials and menu favourites.  You can feel the passion and excitement running through his veins. Everything he showed us looked delicious, including what was being grilled, all the meats looks mouth-watering.    We ended up buying some takeout for the evening.  We ordered the large lamb souvlaki dinner ($22 I think) with the optional taverna salad (additional $5), a pork souvlaki on a pita ($10) and a eggplant dip (forgot what it was on the menu but it was $8) which came with pita.    The lamb was tender, clean tasting (not gamey at all) and cooked to our liking (medium rare).  we opted for the potato and rice sides but the owner pointed out we could get some of the daily specials as sides as well.  The potatoes were cooked well and seasoned nicely, very soft.  Rice was also a hit.  The taverna salad consisted of whole wedged tomates, cucumbers, fresh feta cheese, olives, onions, and hot peppers dressed in olive oil and oregano.  It was made to order, fresh and paired well with our dinner, the portion was very large.  The pork souvlaki was an absolute stand out. You can get pork souvlaki anywhere and I've probably tried over a dozen places by now (living close to the Danforth as a child). Boyfriend and I agreed that hands down this is the best souvlaki we've had in ages!  The pork is tender and the seasoning is flavourful, the taziki sauce has the right amount of punch from the garlic, the tomatoes and onion finish off the sandwich nicely. It was so delicious without being greasy, messy and chewy like so many other Greek places around these days.    The eggplant dip was great as well, it is not like baba ganoush, more like chunks of tender eggplant blended with olive oil, peppers and spices.  There is a nice spicy kick to it (still quite mild). Different is the word I would use to describe it, we were very surprised with how much we liked it with the pita.  Overall I would highly recommend Anestis Taverna!  It's fresh and new, it's all your favourite Greek dishes done right.  Such a pleasant experience with all the staff there, the passion is evident through the hospitality and food that they serve.    5 stars."}
{"text":"Fantastic home style Greek food with a super friendly staff. Owner George is a sweetie, very attentive, wants to make sure you're happy."}
{"text":"Great addition to the dwindling Greek restaurants on the Dani with a big patio on the side street. Friendly staff, fresh fish offered daily and nice portions - food was delicious. They appreciate the business and want to accommodate guests."}
{"text":"Haven't tasted food like this since I visited Greece years ago. Great service- delicious food- so cozy and good vibes :) :)"}
{"text":"The Danforth is slowly evolving and while still predominantly \"Greek\", as long time restaurants fail to thrive, Thai, Japanese, and other places replace them.    Anetis is occupying what I think used to be Mr. Greek which has been in decline for some years.  It now has a bright open decor that allows for large groups or cozier couples to wine and dine.  The gentleman who seated us showed us the specials first as they were on display by the front entrance.  I'm not sure pre-cooked food displayed in steam table style is a great way to showcase the daily specials.  It just shows they were cooked hours ago and are now developing a film from sitting in a steel tray. On the other hand the fresh fish on ice is a good way to show you FRESH food.  We ordered grilled octopus, village salad,  and the lamb souvlaki.  The side salad was literally shredded iceberg lettuce with a dill dressing and a single olive.  The village salad in contrast was nice chunks of cucumber, tomato, red onion, olives, and a generous piece of feta.  The lamb souvlaki was quite good.  Perfectly cooked, tender chunks of lamb that was very satisfying.  The grilled octopus was tender but also stringy.  Not sure if that was a result of the way it was braised or pressure cooked before it was grilled?  It came with a dollop of taramasalata and a dollop of some lentil puree and some sliced roasted red peppers.  I am not sure the flavours all complemented each other and/or the octopus.  Service was friendly and prompt.  The one thing I did not like was what I assumed was the rmanager or supervisor giving one of the staff grief for seating a couple at a 2 top instead of in a booth.  He could have offered to re-seat the couple (they were NOT complaining) and taken the poor guy aside to explain instead of disciplining in public.  Would try other items on the menu the next time I'm in Greektown."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there for late lunch/early dinner. Not particularly looking for this place, but got into by chance. And it turned out a great choice.  Friendly staff and nice cute interior. We took a long time to decide which dish we will offer and ended up to take a trip to a showcase near the entrance.  There were soup dishes, and musaka just came out of the oven. I ordered it because it looked so delicious. It WAS delicious.  I would like to come back with my boyfriend next."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I only give it 4 stars because of the waiting staff being very lax and slow sometimes. If you don't care about that and only the food then you will not be disappointed. I suggest that you try the daily specials because they're made fresh and they're usually truly traditional Greek culinary experiences. Being Greek myself, this restaurant is the closest to my mamas cooking so that says a lot. The owners are also incredibly friendly and nice. The grilled octopus is great and comes with different dips. The melitzanosalata is also great! If you have the chance please try the stuffed zucchini's if they're available on special or the roasted lamb. The mousaka and pastitsio are also very good."}
{"text":"Wine nights TUESDAY TO FRIDAY!!! And the food is great too! Great service and the souvlaki (lamb) was amazing. Coming back next week!"}
{"text":"Best Greek food in TO! Excellent hot table and beautiful restaurant. The owners make you feel like family and the food is truly homemade. Consistent and delicious! Must try includes the lemon chicken soup, musaka and beef with orzo."}
{"text":"It's funny when I read reviews of people who have no clue about Greek food like the lady below who expected feta on anything and gave 2 stars.  I haven't tried all the Greek restaurants in Toronto but this is by far the best, honest and real Greek food. Very good quality, real feta (=Greek) not the white cheese you find in the grocery store and illegally use the word feta.  Friendly environment, Greek hospitality! Well done guys!"}
{"text":"The spot is very nice. Has a Greece vibe and friendly servers. Pricing is average for greek food. A chicken platter with rice & potatoes with a very basic salad for $17.99  The potatoes were good along with the rice but I didn't like the taste of the chicken. The texture was good but it had an odd taste. The tzatziki sauce was pretty good"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Ordered the calamari and eggplant dip with pita. Huge portions. We shared the chicken souvlaki with fries. Great place to share food. The only issue we had was that the service was slow that afternoon. Very nice people work there but they were busy I guess."}
{"text":"The dolmades are super delicious, highly recommend it! We two people ordered three starters to share, and I think that's a proper amount of food."}
{"text":"For that price, I recommend to choose another place. There's plenty of excellent Greek restaurants on Danforth...  the plates aren't generous and a bit dry.   The service is really bad. They aren't organized at all! They first brought me a plate of rice I didn't ordered. Then the waitress forgot my shrimps and served my friends first. I've waited 10mn for my plate.   The atmosphere is more like a fast food than a real restaurant but the price is the one of a real restaurant.   I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I agree with all the good reviews below. We wanted to go to a patio on danforth and found this place randomly on the weekend. We were both very impressed with everything we had and will definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"Found this gem on Yelp. Thought we'd deviate from our usual Pantheon and Messini, what a great decision! From the moment we walked in, to the moment we exited, we were treated with such warmth as if we were guests to their home. As the gentleman (owner!?) welcomes us in, he showed us specials that are not on the menu. Our Server was also full of life and very entertaining.   The lamb shops were juicy, tender and not gamy. Potatoes and rice were also nicely cooked. The Server recommended us the grilled calamari and said it was the best in town, I have to say it definitely was one of the best I've had. Saganaki came with garlic toast and pita, garlic toast was a delightful surprise. Lamb souvlaki was also good but I prefer the lamb chops as they were more tender.   This is definitely the nicest and most modern Greek restaurant I've visited on Danforth. I love the pillow decorations on the benches, they remind me of sunny Santorini   Did I mention half price glass wines Tuesday through Friday??? Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"So fresh. Real athentic wines. Ambiance was nice but the boyfriend didn't like the beer selection. Taziki so was so good"}
{"text":"Delicious food and beautiful setting with updated decor and open space. The space would be great for hosting an event.  The staff were friendly and accommodating.  I ordered the lamb souvlaki with potatoes and veggies.  The Greek lemon potatoes were the best, I would go back just for the potatoes!  The side salad consists of shredded romaine lettuce with a vinaigrette dressing and olives.  It is tasty, but I prefer the traditional Greek salad.  You can upgrade to traditional salad for a few dollars."}
{"text":"Situated on the Danforth.  Staff were friendly and we got to sit outside on their patio. Our server was lovely.  We went for a few appetizers with our wine. The arugula salad was nice but lacked flavor.  The calamari where small, I've had better.  The sakanaki was delicious and never fails to impress me when they light the alcohol up.  Good paring with wine. I watched as some of the main dishes came out and they looked good.  So maybe I ordered the wrong items. Will go back and give them another try."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Greek restaurant where I wasn't served a Greek salad with my large souvlaki dinner.  I had a plain leafy salad.  The portion sizes were small.  Huge plate, little rice and 2 potatoes.  Rice and potatoes were cold.  Since they increased the min. wage, they cheaped out on the food portions.. hard to find Greek restaurants like Mr. Greek that fill up your plate and the food is hot. Because you cheaped out Anestis, I cheaped out on the tip! Never going back again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Been there twice and both times my family and I were very happy. Food is excellent and the portions are large. Specials made fresh every day that aren't in the regular menu. Daily fresh fish also available.  We were greeted at the door and the wait staff was polite and helpful. They provided my 16 month old son with some mashed up potatoes to eat that turned out to be free of charge. This place is our new Danforth Greek food spot."}
{"text":"My favorite Greek restaurant on the Danforth. Menu offers great variety for all tastes. The staff is super welcoming and make you feel at home. I recommend the lamb souvlaki dinner and taramosalata dip. Order the large lamb dinner because it's a better cut of meat than the small, said the server. Other must haves include saganaki and domades. Took my parents one time but they did not like it as much as I do. They thought the rice was undercooked and the potatoes weren't as good as other Greek places. But what do they know?"}
{"text":"Bad food, bad service, poor excuses. Don't take the reservation if you use the \"kitchen is backed up\" as your excuse. Don't offer me free coffee and dessert as consolation, I'll take the check please and not return."}
{"text":"Great Greek restaurant!   We had many items from the appetizer menu like tzaziki, platter of 3 dips, dolmas and Greek salad. All tasted great and really good flavour, the Tzaziki was good but had a little too much garlic.   We ordered the Platter of 1kg lamb chops (ontario lamb), amazing. It was $60 and worth every penny, it could feed 4 Greeks or 8 normal people!  The have a menu of homemade dishes in the hot table which looked really good.   Also you can see the fresh fish and pick the one you want to be grilled etc....  (This location used to be the old mr greek) Great new place to try!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! The Greek salad was a proper Greek salad and the lamb was cooked perfect! Definitely going back again!! Get the lemon potatoes, they are the best!"}
{"text":"The food is really not that great. The veggies were some sort of unappetizing looking beans that dont taste very nice. The lamb chops were ok. Nothing special. Chicken Souvlaki was ok. Again not great.   I walked out wishing I had not eaten there. The service is excellent so I gave them 3 stars for good service and good atmosphere (if you sit outside). My tastebuds are not happy."}
{"text":"Staff were really friendly, but food was sub-par.  Ordered the chicken souvalaki and gyro dinner plates and after waiting for over 30 minutes for our meal, the chicken was overdone and rice was severely undercooked.  Even though the restaurant offered to replace the rice with french fries or bread, no discount was applied to the meal.  Never going back again."}
{"text":"I find that Yelp is right about 85% of the time. I rely on you guys when I eat out!   Unfortunately, this was not one of those times!   The saganaki was good, always is anywhere!    I ordered lamb souvlaki.  It came with a salad.  Odd salad.  Shredded lettuce... No feta.  ONE MEASLY OLIVE!  And it had a bunch of dill in it.  I've not seen Greek food use dill, so that was strange.   The lamb was undercooked.  It also had lots of oregano.  Problem is that it was huge pieces.... Poked the gums, very hard to eat!  Seriously!   Roast potatoes were excellent.   Owner yelling at staff was disconcerting!   Waiter hard to find!"}
{"text":"Very Impressed! Anestis breathes new life into the Danforth's otherwise middle of the road Greek fare. The standard menu is similar to all other Greek restaurants, but its done better than most! The restaurant doesn't mask average ingredients with salt and oil and you really taste the subtle flavors found in the Mediterranean. The specials seemed like dishes one would find serendipitous in a small off the beaten path Greek village. The Lamb and artichoke in a light dill cream sauce was amazing, as was the daily broiled fish topped with fresh veggies.  Additional bonus points goes to the Horiatiki (Village Salad). Most restaurants on the Danforth charge extra for an authentic Greek salad that doesn't have lettuce as a filler, but Anestis offers the original at a regular price. My only suggestion would be to offer other types of grilled fish on the Horiatiki rather than only salmon.  The service was impeccable and one can sense the staff's pride in their offering. The restaurant is large, airy and wheelchair accessible; a plus when bringing an elderly mother-in-law out for culinary treat!  I highly recommend a visit!"}
