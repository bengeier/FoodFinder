{"text":"Very good tasting pizzas and wings with decent prices and most importantly it is HALAL."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN!!!

My girlfriend and I decided to place an order Friday night so we could eat before enjoying the weekend.  The food arrived in good time, however the delivery driver they sent was brand new, spoke little-to-no English, and could not figure out how to use the debit machine.  It was stuck on some settings page, apparently.

He spends nearly 15 minutes outside our apartment trying to figure out how to make the machine worked, all while our food is out of the carrying bag (which might have helped the food stay warm).  Finally, he decides to call his store.  After struggling to figure out the number on his phone for several minutes, he could simply not communicate the issue to the store manager. My girlfriend ends up explaining the situation to the owner, who said he'll send another driver with a new debit machine right away, and to go enjoy our food.

We finally sit down to eat about 20-25 minutes after the delivery guy first arrived, the wings are now basically room temperature.  We devour the pizza and wedges, which were still lukewarm.  We finish eating and overhear something; the delivery driver was still lurking in the hallway in front of our apartment and had been there for the past 20 minutes loudly talking on his cell phone.  We finally had to open the door and tell him to leave and go wait in the lobby; there are other tenants in the building, don't go making noise to disturb everyone.  Besides, doesn't the restaurant have other deliveries for him to do?

So we wait.  And wait.  Aaaand wait.  3 calls total in the next hour to find out when the other driver is coming.  First CSR calls the store; they are on their way, should be here in the next few minutes, call back if he's not there in 10 mins.  We wait 15, call back.  Apparently the driver is on his way, but they also had to do a delivery on their way.  Seriously thinking they don't want my money.  She again assures me they'll be there in the next few minutes.  This is now seriously cutting into our weekend time, we had places to be on a Friday night.  We wait another 20 and call for a 3rd time.  The CSR says the notes read that after I got off the phone with them the 2nd time, they called the store, they said they would call you right away.  I received no such call.  I told them we'll be leaving soon, and unless they get here in the next few minutes, they're out payment.

The driver (who was identified as the owner or manager by the CSR's) finally strolls in 20 minutes after that. with a debit machine.  No apologies, he just nervously laughed about the woes of having a brand new driver. They then charge full price, we had to ask for him to at least remove the delivery fee.  That's right.  Full price for food that had to get cold because they sent over someone with no grasp of how to work a debit machine or basic customer interaction.  

THAT'S how you lose a regular customer, my friends!!"}
{"text":"Good local take out pizza joint in The West Toronto Junction. I eat here all the time and I really like their $10 three-topping large walk-in special. Being a Junction resident, this is my cheap goto pizza joint. Is it a \"craft\" pizza joint like the area's first and still undisputed \"best\" pizza restaurant Vesuvio's: no. But it's a good place to get a value-priced pizza for the less discriminating folks that aren't \"foodies.\""}
{"text":"Worst of em all. Save ur $
It's next day n my stomach still hurtsssssssss
Do not eat here."}
{"text":"I stopped in this place the other week, and ordered fried chicken.  After I'd ordered and paid I started looking around in there while I was waiting for the food.  Its pretty filthy.  I know when you deal with fried food there's a certain amount of inevitable grease splatter, but they did nothing to clean any of it up.  The computer behind the counter was especially grotty.  The white keyboard and mouse were black from grease.  The floors and walls were just filthy, and the customer eating area looked like it hadn't been touched in a few days.  Food all over the floors, tables with caked on ketchup, and cheese.  I'm sure its an attractive eating place for roached and rats but not for humans.

The cook was more interested in his cell phone conversation than cooking, so consequently the meal reflected that.  The chicken was like dried up old leather.  What should have been a nice fried-chicken crispy skin was like tree bark.   

One morning few days ago I saw they had dropped ad flyers at all the apartments on my floor, so I picked them all up before the neighbors got them and dumped them in the recycle bin.  Yeah that bad."}
{"text":"Bought two slices here recently- both times they were unbelievably salty, and pretty bad otherwise too. I have to laugh at the 'free' potato wedge given with each slice, and the fact that it was actually better than the pizza slice. Dodgy atmosphere doesn't help."}
{"text":"As usual, in the mail, I got the flyer months after they opened in 2016. I had coupons that were for only this new location and coupons from the locations \"before\" this place opened and the counter-guy honoured all coupons that I wanted to use, no exceptions and get this; as many as I wanted to pay for !! The anchovies was counted as one item, whereas other pizza places counted as two items or a separate more expensive item. The tax is included in the prices, so no surprises. Taste speaks for itself and I am happy that I have this \"double~double\" pizza nearby, the other locations are too far from me, even in the same city. I wonder if the cook is part-Italian, how can the dough be so perfect ?"}
{"text":"Didn't actually end up ordering from here. This rating is for the service.

We recently stayed in a hotel room in Toronto which had Double Double flyers in it. The prices in the flyer were very reasonable. Two large three topping pizzas for 24 dollars including delivery, so I call and place the order. My total comes to thirty eight dollars and we only ordered the deal from the flyer. When I asked what happened to the prices the woman became rude and argumentitive, and was unwilling to honor the advertisement. Ironically, if it was just the price hike I might have still ordered, but once the woman got nasty I took my business elsewhere. I won't be ordering pizza from Double Double any time soon."}
