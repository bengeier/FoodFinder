{"text":"Best gyro I have ever had, stood in line for one hour and it was definitely worth every minute of it.  Regular gyro costs 7 dollars and is big enough to make you full, jumbo gyro is 9 dollars and can feed two people.  The regular gyro I had must have had 1lb  of meat on it, the veggies were fresh and the cucumber sauce was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Seinfeld fans will quickly agree that this place is the Gyro Nazi. The food is a four and the service a two, hence the three star rating. The woman behind the counter seems to have woken up on the wrong side of the bed for the past two decades, and shows no appreciation for having the most successful food stand in one of the greatest public markets in the nation. Once you get past the mostly unpleasant experience of waiting in line next to a fish stand and ordering from Ms. Scrooge, a great sandwich awaits you.   I STRONGLY recommend sharing a Jumbo gyro for two. The meat is piled on to absurd heights a la Slyman's corned beef."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon recently to give it another try after I had fondly remembered visiting the Steve's Gyro stand about 2 decades ago, back before it was \"a thing\". It was insanely crowded; the wait was about an hour, the line wrapping all the way out into the loading dock.    To my knowledge, there are only 2 women who work the stand, so it's understandable that the wait is considerable. However, the lengthy wait was not helped by one of the women working the stand, who appeared to be on her cell phone half the time and who was not serving any customers but merely tending to the meat while she talked on her phone (the phone was probably filthy germy, like most cell phones).     The other woman made gyros but handled customer money at the same time. This can't be good food hygiene. We were somewhat ill later that same night, and I would guess that this is the reason why.     The gyros themselves were hefty - we got the jumbo size. Lots of spicy meat. Too much to finish in one sitting. Still, nothing I have never experienced before in a gyro. The sauce, which is highly touted by many to be the best gyro sauce, was nothing spectacular. Had some flavor, but I honestly prefer classic tzatziki (cucumber) sauce to theirs.      Overall, I'd say go if you're at the West Side market, are in the mood for a gyro, and the line isn't too long (if it is close to the food stand itself then you're probably ok, but if it's out to the loading dock, you'll be in for a long wait). Just don't be surprised if you get upset stomach (or worse) afterward."}
{"text":"No, their gyros are not worth waiting on a long line.  I went there on Wednesday, and it took me 45 minutes to finally order my gyro. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the lady who was making gyros because she didn't have gloves on. She was sweating badly, kept wiping the sweat off of her face with a dirty towel, and continued making gyros with the same sweaty hands! I was totally turned off and grossed out. If you want to see what poor hygiene looks like, this is the place to go.  The gyro tasted good, but I don't think it's worth waiting for 45 minutes. I have had much better gyros before with much better services. I think it is arrogant to say to the customers, \"We have our own rules, so don't ask us to do anything that is not our rule.\"   Nope, I'm not going back there."}
{"text":"Nothing Special about it. Just a regular gyro which can be made at home. I wouldn't recommend waiting in line just to try it. There are other better options."}
{"text":"This place is so over rated. Meat is extremely greasy, it could be cooked a little longer. the sauce is much better than average. It just wasn't worth the effort. Much better options. I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Best ever, and I worked in gyro joint. Very large, fresh, warm.Don't order the jumbo unless there are at least two of you. Be prepared to wait in line. Take it to the balcony and enjoy."}
{"text":"Location is great.  5 minute walk from the W.25-Ohio City Station.  I stopped by on the way to the airport and picked 2 up.  If you go on a Saturday make sure to get there early.  They ran out of meat around 4.  I suggest getting there before 3. Food Excellent! Tammy was very nice. Portion size PRICELESS!"}
{"text":"I saw that their pita bread was in a package. But it was good food."}
{"text":"I was there before 11am and there was a line, but I waited about 5mins. The gyros looks good with lots of meat, but the taste is nothing to rave about. Compare to Chicago gyros, it needs more spices and lamb flavor. From all the reviews, I expected to blow my mind. Maybe those reviewers never had a darn good one before. I'm glad I didn't have to wait along time but still dissapointed and won't be back."}
{"text":"New to Cleveland, my experience with the food scene has been limited, but this place definitely piqued my interest in trying more local eats. The line is ridiculous, BUT it's not so much the length of the line as it is how inefficient they are. I am disappointed at how long it takes them to make something that they make hundreds of times a day, but I would still wait an hour in their ridiculously slow moving line because it's that good. I would have given them five stars if they could be more efficient.  On to the gyro: It's hyuge. I was only able to finish 1/3 of it. The meat is extremely flavorful ( a tad on the salty side, but I like it that way). The home made sauce is also delicious and the perfect compliment to the gyro.  Final note: the line is long. It sucks. Get in line early (I think they open at 10ish?). At 12, the line is 2 hours. Don't get in line later than 3, they might run out! it's worth it though."}
{"text":"Saw this place on TV a while back.  When I went to Cleveland on a business trip, I wanted to try this place for myself.  I did not regret it.  This was the best gyro that I have ever tasted.  If I'm ever back in the area, you can be sure you'll find me on the line at Steve's"}
{"text":"They do the gyro, and do it well!  It is neat that this place is inside the West Side Market.  I would agree with another reviewer that they are not terribly efficient in processing customers through.  The gyros are ridiculously large."}
{"text":"Deeeeeeeeeeee-licious.  75% juicy, tender lamb yet with an outer crisp crust.  Just enough of fresh veggies for a superb contrast (just like in the middle east)."}
{"text":"I've lived in Cleveland for 10 years, and despite everything I've heard about this place, I'd never had one of their gyros.  SO, seeing as I'm leaving town in a few months, I decided it was time.  First, the food...it was great.  Probably the best gyro I've ever had.  The portion size is HUGE...no need to get the large.  I would have no problem making this a weekend habit, but...  The line...the wait...totally unacceptable.  My original plan was to grab a gyro and spend a lazy saturday afternoon walking around the market...but after waiting in line for over an hour, all I wanted to do was leave. I waited in line for an hour to get A GYRO.  and for the life of me, I still don't know why.  When I got in line, I figured it might be 15-20 minutes tops.  But the line just did not move.  An hour later, I finally got to the front of the line, expecting to figure out why things were so slow. maybe there was some special process they used, or some ingredients were cut/made to order, but that wasn't they case.  There were trays full of everything just sitting there. I never saw a single reason things took so long, other than the fact that the workers would stop to talk, check their phones, and sometimes just stand and do nothing.  I would give 5 stars for the food...but honestly, I don't think I'll ever go back unless there's not a line.  Service gets 1 star."}
{"text":"AMAZE BALLS! The best gyro in Cleveland hands down! Lettuce, onion, tomato, cucumber sauce and gyro meat all wraped tightly in a delicious pita. Huge chunks of gyro meat, not skinny strips which I loved! The pita was fresh and didn't fall apart unlike some other gyro places. $8 for a gyro, but you can, and probably have to split it with someone because they are huge! If you are hungry while shopping at the market you must get a gyro at Steve's! Yummmmmy in the tummy!"}
{"text":"Great Gyro!  Great Value! If  Adam Richmand from \"Man v Food\" knows about this spot and ate hear then of course you know its Amazing!"}
{"text":"I probably won't write anything new you haven't seen or heard about Steve's Gyro's. My only advice...........get one now!  The regular size is huge and the jumbo is just insane with one full pound of meat, but beware the larger size is not for the meek or faint of heart! It's a pretty messy ordeal so find a place to sit down and enjoy. I tried eating one in the car which ended badly. If you go there during the lunch hour weekdays or during a Saturday be prepared to wait, sometimes for as long as an hour or more. I usually go right after the lunch rush on a Wednesday, 5-10 minute wait at that time. Enjoy this little piece of heaven."}
{"text":"Really can't add anything that already hasn't been said, a huge gyro with lots of meat (crispy parts to). The sauce is not traditional but I like it a lot.  Go there every time I am in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Steve Gyro's Non-Celveland Resident Survival Guide:  Parking: The West Side Market website stated that there were parking lots on W. 25th street but my wife and I while driving up and down 25th street never spotted them. The parking lot for the market we found was on Lorain street that's located behind the market. It's clearly marked and allows 2 free hours of parking which is an ample enough time to see everything the market has to offer. While leaving we did see that a car was broken into pretty close to us but I guess crime happens everywhere and I'm assuming that this not an example of what occurs in that parking lot on a regular basis.   Location: The gryo stand is towards the back on the left hand side of the market across from the popcorn shop if you're entering from the main 25th street entrance.   The Wait: Because of reading past yelp reviews I avoided coming here around Noon or later. I got to the stand around 10:45am and there was no one there. Not sure if this is always true but getting here before 11:00am was advantageous for me and recomended.  Price: $8 for a regular.  Where to Eat: Nothing in the market is readily available to sit down and eat at. Outside in the alley between the produce section and the main market there are plenty of benches to rest and enjoy. There is also a little park across 25th street where benches and ledges are available. Just be ready to fend off birds. I guess they know when someone is eating a gryo from Steve's because I had several feathered friends trying to join me as my messy meal was being consumed.  Worth the Hype?: Yep. I don't eat a lot of gyros but this was the best one I've had hands down. Their meat doesn't conform to the same flavor profiles as other gyro meat I've had in the past. It's more peppery, more seasoned, and it's delicious. The sauce is sour cream based and that's the main component you'll taste from it, but add that with the meat, fresh lettuce, onion, tomato, and warm pita bread and you'll get a perfect bite of tastyness. The main challenge, because the portion size of meat is generous, is getting all those ingredients together, but when you do it will be pretty awesome. Is it worth the mess? Yes. Is it worth the $8 price? Yes. Is it worth an 1 hour wait? Sure. This place is getting so much hype it's hard not to come in and try them out especially if you are a Cleveland visitor like I was.  Last bit of advice: When consuming one of these delicious gyros either make sure the person you are hanging out with for the day eats one as well or have plenty of minty gum at hand. I continually had Steve's gyros on my breath throughout the day. Steve, although awesome, didn't want to leave me alone after I left the market."}
{"text":"Awesome gyro. Tasted great. I purchased the jumbo for $10 and shared it with my wife. The normal portion is $8. Honestly I could of ate the large portion myself because it was so tasty. Sharing it allowed us to buy some truffles around the corner for desert."}
{"text":"Subpar gyros, long lines, and service with a crappy attitude. No thanks.   I feel bad for anyone who thinks this is a real gyro. The meat, which they take from a diner grill to a big metal container (WTH?) is soggy and not even remotely close to what good gyro meat should be. Add to that the contempt for customers and there is no way I would touch this place again, especially not with other good food options inside or very close to West Side market."}
{"text":"When you see a line of people waiting for something that must mean its wonderful.  Steve's has a long line and the Gyros are the best.  Wife and I came here w/my brother and future sister in law.  Take a day and tour the Market.   When Adam Richman says its one of his best places to eat than you know its good.   Get a soda and take the gyro to a park across the street.  Its great, yes there is a wait but you wont be disappointed. FYI, leave the Gyro in the foil wrapper and eat w/bottom of gyro in foil, its a bit messy and over filled w/meat, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and a delicious sauce.  Bring a fork if your a sloppy eater.  WONDERFUL.  I'll be eating one of these everytime I come to C-town."}
{"text":"I have been going to Steve's Gyros since I was a child- other than the West Side Market being a Cleveland institution, the gyros here are THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. Simply put. They pack on so much meat, the meat is seasoned incredibly well, and the tzatziki sauce is to die for. I recently brought my boyfriend to eat here, and he insists we eat here every time we come to visit my parents in Cleveland (we're from Cincinnati). You might have to wait in line, but it is oh so worth it."}
{"text":"Steve's Gyros IS amazing!  I also love the sauce!  Yes, you're going to wait in line, and it can be slow.  It's a small space and there is only so much room to hold workers.  Look around and you won't see a table to sit at.  You know that going in, right?  This is a MARKET, you stand up to eat.  The gyro is huge, the meat is piled up high!  If you're taking it to go, grab some extra pita, there's enough for leftovers.    $8 for regular?  Worth it.  Grab one, eat it and don't complain about the price or the standing.  It's your choice to make."}
{"text":"Came here because Man vs. Food featured their gyro.  It was as good as advertised.  I had to wait about 30 minutes in line for it but it was worth it.  Everything here is cooked fresh, you can see them making the gyro meat as you wait.  I got the regular size gyro for $8 which is bigger than most gyros at other places I've been too.  It the best gyro I've ever had.  You have to stop by here if you're ever in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I loved the regular gyro! For $9, you get a pretty hefty gyro with all the fixin's (lettuce, tomato, onion) and stuffed to the brim with lamb. Delicious and a great price!"}
{"text":"For me it is all about the taste. The fact that the line sometimes is 15 or 20 minutes long just goes to prove people were there for what they like. Yes, like myself the first time I went there, I was there just to see what all the hype was about and I was delighted to find out that the week was 100% worth it.   The meet was shaved nice and thin and so tender it was like butter. The sauce is amazing that is undescribable but has a nice bite / tang to it.   I have been to other gyro places in the area and so far none have compared to this. Meat is typically similar but it is the sauce that makes this truly one-of-a-kind gyro sandwich."}
{"text":"We got super lucky and didn't have to wait in the long line like half the reviews that we read about! This place sure has its own spunk. Just take a look at all of the signs that they have posted about service haha make sure you follow their rules! We ordered the regular sized gyro to split between two people and it was more than enough!! Not sure how anyone would be able to finish a big one. Definitely messy but definitely worth it! They are delicious, perfectly seasoned, and full of great flavor. If you're ever in town, you should check it out if you've got the time. I'm not sure if I would wait in the long line for it, but still pretty yummy. I found it strange that they didn't have any napkins or utensils. We couldn't find them anywhere and had to pour our bottled water that we bought on our hands to clean up."}
{"text":"My favorite gyro in Cleveland. A little pricey but worth it since they stuff it. I get the regular size..I can't even imagine how big the jumbo is !"}
{"text":"Located in the back of West Side Market, this gyro stand always has a huge line which makes it easy to find.   There's only two sizes (regular or jumbo) and two types of drinks (pop or water); the funny thing about the sizes is that it just means how much meat you want.  If one pita is enough to fill two people, I don't even want to know how hungry you'd have to be to eat a whole jumbo gyro.  Their sauce is tangy fantastic that cuts through the well-spiced lamb and cooled with the simple veggies (lettuce, onions, and tomatoes).  You might have to wait nearly an hour for your food, but definitely worth the wait.  Also, remember that they typically run out of meat by like 3:30pm...so the earlier the better."}
{"text":"The Best Gyro On Earth!  Anyone who really knows me knows that I am a die hard Zorba's Gyro fan. They have now been dethroned as the best Gyro I have ever eaten.  We first went to Steve's the day I bought my Porsche. We both parked on the street. F.Y.I. Parking is free in two lots off West 24th Street, including the Market's Tenant Association-maintained parking lot just east of the Market off of Lorain. I believe there is a 2 hour limit though.  Once we found Steve's we went to the back of the line which was out of the market and pass the double doors in the back of house, truck unloading area. The line did more pretty fast though.   I can't tell you how many times we were asked \"What are you in line for?\" I said \"a gyro\" and they would say \"That better be a damn good gyro.\" The only thing that pissed me off about waiting was all the the rude people in the market. No one says \"Excuse Me\" anymore? People would just walk up to the line trying to get pass and not say anything and just expect you to make a path for them. Who do the think you are? Moses?!  Once we got to the counter to order both ladies working were very nice. My wife and I each got a jumbo and our daughter got  a regular. A regular gyro is $8 and a jumbo is $10. A jumbo could easily feed two to three people. Just buy some extra pita's and you'll have gyro's for days. We got our sauce on the side as we were taking ours back home to Pittsburgh before we could dive into them.  Once we got home we nuked them for a few seconds and then added the sauce. OMG!!!! FREAKING OUTSTANDING! I waited about 1 hour for the gyro and would have waited 2 hours it was that good! The pita was soft and buttery and the meat was cooked to perfection! Nice and tender and juicy! Totally worth all of the aggravation and waiting!   You should try to get to Steve's before 2pm on weekends to ensure you get a gyro. We went again this pass Saturday around 3pm and were told that the women in front of us was their last customer of the day. :( Oh well we went and had a great meal at Zanzibar so it was all good.  Steve's is cash only however there is a PNC ATM a couple doors down West 25th Street from the entrance to the produce side of the market. And a no name high fee charging ATM right near Steve's if you don't have cash on you."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Steve's before they ran out.  The bread, meat and sauce were all very good as expected.  Messy yes, excellent flavor yes.  This is definitely better than the side of the road Gyro place.  Absolutely worth making the trip and having one if your in the mood.    There were some negatives though that stopped me from a 5 star.  First, they were running low which meant the tomatoes were about as spent as could be.  The onions, ditto but worse, covered in specs of meat from other gyros throughout the day.  I got myself past that as it was all going to the same place.    The bread was a bit oily and the honest truth is the sauce is great going down, but not as great three hours later for the aftermath.  No one wants to come in speaking distance of me.  But again, the overall flavor and quality of the gyro itself, I am fine with being in isolation right now.    Worth it."}
{"text":"So I recently moved to Cleveland and I was told I must go to the West Side Market because it's a foodies paradise.  After walking around a bit I stumbled upon a place called Steve's Gyros that was featured on \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate\" with Anne Burrell & \"Man vs Food\" with Adam Richmond.  Because I'm obsessed with all food shows I had to check this place out.  After about a 30 min wait I finally got my gyro and let me tell you it was definitely worth the wait!  The meat was perfectly seasoned and the tzatziki sauce was the best I ever had!  If your going to the West Side Market definitely check this place out. Make sure you come hungry though cause this baby is filling!"}
{"text":"Steve's opens around 10 a.m., and I knew it was vital to get here early. Usually by around noon, the line can get extremely long, and it may be pushing it to get a gyro here if you show up after 1 p.m. The average wait time can be up to one hour, and Steve's may close the line about 60-90 minutes before closing to ensure everyone in line gets served. Luckily for me, by being among the first that day, I didn't have to wait long.  I ordered a regular gyro with everything (lamb/beef strips on a grilled, buttered pita, with tomato, onion, lettuce, and their sour cream-based sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed the flavorful lamb and beef meat from the spit. The fresh veggies in a gyro always get a thumbs up from me. The pita was buttered and toasted to perfection on the flattop.  Unfortunately, I wasn't a huge fan of the sour cream-based sauce. Perhaps it's just my general aversion to sour cream. For a small consolation, I appreciated the sauce's slight kick.  For $8, I got a very generous portion of food. The regular gyro alone must have had over a pound of meat. Steve's has an incredible fan following, and I'm privileged to have tried their gyro for myself. But ultimately, taste is one of the main factors in my rating, and the sour cream-based sauce didn't work for me. Sorry guys...just an average score from me (slightly bumped up for the great gyro meat and the wonderful pita toasting)."}
{"text":"Grab one of these bad boys( my pref is the gyro(LARGE) minus the onions and tomatoes & get the sauce! Grab a Coke as well and run across the street and enjoy Steves Gyro in the Park !!! IT IS THAT PHREAKIN GOOD!!! I had a hungry west 25th wolf dog come up to me and tilt his head in envy(might have been awkward for him/her to see a human devouring food so feaverishly !!!!!) He stared in amazement as I was about to drop the last piece of warm gyro into my mouth! I calmly lifted it away from my mouth and tossed it into the air!! Just as I flung it just above the west 25ths wolf dog head...\"I said here you go kid\"-ala Mean Joe Green style for a lil while! I then even poured a lil coke on the ground for the doggie to wash this gift from god gyro  morsel down with!  Booooo Ya Baby(and I was gone from the park) Wolf dog comes to the same spot each day lookin for me(or is it that gyro from steves he so much craves???)......sooooooooooooooo I been told!!"}
{"text":"First timer at Steve's and the WSM.  Went on a Monday and the line was not long,  but the wait was,  as the meat after the lunch hour was still cooking.  Was it worth the wait.....................get in line and find out for yourself.  Against my better judgement and reading many reviews, I ordered the Jumbo to share with my wife as we were also sharing a Falafel sandwich from around the corner.   This Gyro is the meat lovers gyro of all gyros!!!  As big as my head and just damn good gyro madness. Juicy meat and cooked perfect ( hence the wait) with a great pita and sauce that was not typical of any other gyro I've had. That sauce would be good on an old sneaker or rotten 2x4. Would love it on a burger or hot dog or a great roast beef sandwich!!!    When I go back, and I will, I will order the regular as I think the ratio of meat to other ingredients will will actually work better........and be easier to eat. My only caveat is there is no place to sit and eat these bad boys . If you are sharing and get the jumbo, I would order an extra pita and sauce. Yeah, the sauce!!!   Wasn't real sure about lettuce on a gyro, but it works on this one.  In a few days when I feel like eating again, I would go back and eat another if l lived  closer.    So, get in line and people watch while you wait for one of the best Gyros around.  Slammer!!!"}
{"text":"Really Cleveland, and Adam Richman?  I was expecting the best gyro of my life here with all the hype, and instead I got one I didn't really even like.  First off, the reason the line is so long is because the women who run the stand are SLOOOWWW.  As someone who works in foodservice, I guarantee pretty much anyone else in the foodservice business could have made 5 gyros in the time it took them to make 1.  Secondly, yeah, they give you a bunch of meat, but they charge $8.  If you go to any other gyro shop and ask for extra meat you'd get the same if you were willing to pay $8.  Third, their sauce is terrible.  It probably wouldn't be bad if it wasn't spicy, I wish they would have had normal sauce, and the spicy sauce, but they only have spicy.  I assume they put tabasco in it.  I'm not sure if that's the secret, but that's what it seemed like to me.  I was really let down by the experience."}
{"text":"Finally made my way to Steve's Gyro. To say the least it lived up to the hype. I made a good mistake of getting a jumbo Gyro that seemed to last forever. Definitely not a once sitting type of meal! Menu is pretty straight forward, regular or jumbo, the Tzatziki sauce is a little different from most places which is great. Overall this gyro experience was great, can't wait to venture back."}
{"text":"If this place is good enough for my spirit animal Adam Richman, then it is good enough for me and everyone else. The gyro was the best thing I have ever eaten in all of my lives. This single gyro has completed my hunger quest."}
{"text":"Gyros were good but nothing worth a 45+ minute wait. I'm giving 3 stars cuz it didn't taste bad but all of us ended up in the bathroom later with some \"issues\" (if ya know what I mean...)  Maybe the person who commented about the cleanliness had a point? I did  see the lady who made the sandwiches opening the back doors to the loading area for the entire market and wheeling carts back and forth go right back to making the sandwiches without any gloves on or a hand wash. There's lots of time to watch that stuff when you stand in line for a long time.  So for the actual gyro if you still want to eat at your own risk - the tzatziki sauce is not the traditional one you find but not bad. Kind of reminded me of Thousand Island w/ more herbs. The meat is flavorful.   The tomato and onion has been tossed in a vinaigrette so it's got a little tang instead of just bland tomatoes and a strong onion taste.   My brother and hubby said they would wait again before they ended up in the bathroom for an hour. I guess try at your own risk? They tasted good! Worth some quality time on the can? Debatable.  UPDATED - We all spent some more QT in the bathroom since writing this post so I'm taking away a star. That was all we ate that day so...what else could it have been?"}
{"text":"This gyro was like if Buddy Holly came back from the grave, made an album collaborating with Big Bird, and then gave it away on band camp with a free knitted coaster with every download! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful.  Good quality real gyros.  Used to be in corner stall.  Have not been since moved to bigger location."}
{"text":"Went back Two days ago and it was STELLAR like I was used to.  Friendly counter experience, line moved in twenty minutes or so & the taste was out of bounds!   I think the ppl going to Steve's can make the difference too - as no one in front of me asked for one of the 5 deadly sins - and no one behind me was a jerk.   I still had more shopping to do so I even ate it in the rain on a bench outside to get it while it's \"hot\" - love me some Steve's - thanks ladies!"}
{"text":"Two things you need to eat at Steve's Gyros; patience and an appetite.  I had the appetite today, but totally lacked the patience!  My boyfriend and I arrived at the West Side Market around 1 and immediately made a beeline to Steve's.  The line was about 20 people deep so I didn't think our wait would be too long.  Well I was wrong.  There are only 2 girls working the stand but c'mon, its not like gyros are complicated to make.  I'm not sure if it was the heat that was slowing them down or if they normally work at a leisurely pace with a line of customers waiting, but I thought the hour we had to wait for a gyro was ridiculous.  After about 20 minutes of waiting in line, I was sweating buckets and ready to cut my losses and find me some air conditioning.  But I couldn't bear the look of disappointed on the BF's face if I had made him leave, so I stuck it out.  After what seemed like ages of standing and sweating, we finally got our gyros and headed to a bench to chow down.  True to the prior reviews, this gyro was the best I had ever had.  There was so much meat on the gyro I had to take half of it out just so I could take a bite!  The meat was very juicy and had an amazing flavor, just the right amount of spice.  But the sauce is what made the gyro in my opinion.  If they sold it by the jar, I would have bought one for everyone I know.   Even though the gyro is amazing, standing in the heat in that line wasn't worth it for me.  I probably won't go back but I do suggest everyone try a Steve's Gyro at least once."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago where gyro's are a mainstay of fast dining.  Steve's tzatziki sauce is phenomenal.  I recommend getting the jumbo.  Definitely worth the wait in line on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Great gyro's as seen on Man vs Food. The West Side Market is a fantastic market and Steves is inside.  Simple choices and you have to find a bench somewhere to eat and there is usually a line, but worth the wait. There are many good places to eat and drink nearby as well if someone doesn't like gyros in your group."}
{"text":"Really, Cleveland?    You'd think with all of the 5 star reviews being posted these gyros were being made in Narnia.  Is it because it was on Man v. Food that everyone is going ga-ga over this place?  It's a palatable gyro.  It's really hard to mess up what's essentially a beef and lamb meatloaf on a spit.  If it wasn't for the long lines and no seating it would get 3 stars from me.  Even if you end up sacrificing a small bit of quality by going to one of the countless Greek diners in CLE and the surrounding suburbs it's worth it to not wait to go through the endurance race that is their line.  When I walk by the horde of people I can't help but mutter \"lemmings\" under my breath, and move on to finish my shopping."}
{"text":"WOW. just WOW. This is the best gyro I have ever eaten! I loved it so much, I ate here twice within a span of 24 hours. I give the gyros 10 stars, but minus 5 stars for the slow and inefficient service. There are two workers manning the stand, and most of the time, they were just chatting away and having a ball while the customers waited (im)patiently. At the end of the day though, the 1+ hour line is worth it!!   The regular gyro costs $8 and is equivalent to a Chipotle burrito in size. The jumbo gyro is $10 and is pretty much the same size but just with a little extra meat.   I recommend getting a gyro for your entree, a nutella banana crepe from Crepe De Luxe for dessert, and a bubble tea from Kim Se for drink! That is the best meal ever :)"}
{"text":"I love gyros, so I was intrigued to try the \"best gyro in the country\". I came for a \"brunch\" gyro to avoid the line. Now to me, gyros are street food, and a gyro should not cost $7, but once I saw the amount of meat on the thing I understood the price. It's about the size and weight of a Chipotle burrito, only with mostly meat and very little filler.  However, after seeing boxes of mass produced frozen gyro meat (Olympia, the same brand you find in many pizzerias, recognizable by the cheesy posters of smiling women with gyros), I am left wondering what is so special about this sandwich that makes it the \"best gyro in the country\". Sure, the sauce is excellent - slightly spicy and tart, and different than the generic tzatziki on most gyros - but the pita is straight out of a bag and the gyro meat is straight out of a box.  I just don't understand the hype over this place. It's a good gyro, sure, but definitely not worth an hour wait in line. The only thing exceptional about this gyro is its size."}
{"text":"Totally worth the wait. We got there about 11am and it wasn't a really long line ( although one did form shortly after). We had our gyros in about 20 min or so. The Jumbo is enough to share for 2 people! It's in the middle of a farmers market that is always packed so I didnt expect this to be a place of quick service."}
{"text":"...and it's true. This really is fantastic. Ordered the regular size gyro and it was plenty. In fact, I had to eat about four handfuls - yes handfuls - of meat before I could close the gyro to eat it.  Even then I still had two handfuls spill out when I was done. And yes, I ate that, too. Simply delicious. And damnit, now I want more."}
{"text":"I'm in Cleveland for work and a coworker recommended Steve's Gyros. He also told me how they have been on numerous food channel shows. I found it in the market and there was a line. I thought to myself, \"I hope this is worth the wait.\"  Well it was and it was the best gyro that I have ever had.  I'm from St. Louis and we have some authentic Greek restaurants, but there was something about their sauce that made it. Definitely give it a taste if you're in the area."}
{"text":"When we got there the line was kinda long, but it was so worth the wait. The waitress chick made a Seinfeld reference while we were in line so that was awesome! I got the jumbo sized gyro and it definitely satisfied my need to engorge myself"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect from this gyro stand that was located in the West Side Market in downtown Cleveland. I've had plenty of gyros and they all were pretty similar. Nothing to write home about. This one here stands out as being exceptional and probably the best I've ever had.   The first thing you notice is the line and the various \"rules\" that are posted about ordering like: \"don't ask to cut gyro in half.\" If a place can back up their gruffness by putting out great food then I can stand a little attitude with my meal. You will also notice from the various pictures that they were featured on Man vs Food. Easy to see why.   We just ordered the regular size but apparently there's a much larger jumbo size. My petite friend could not finish hers but I was more than capable of conquering my gyro. I tried to imagine what the jumbo size would be like. So what makes these gyros so great? Aside from the amazing quality of the succulent lamb, I would have to say what really stood out was the sauce. Not your typical yogurt or tzatziki sauce but an orange-ish slightly spicy sauce. I might have even tasted a hint of garlic in there somewhere. What ever the secret is, it made this gyro outstanding.   I'm not sure how often I will make it to the Cleveland area but you can believe this will be my designated pit stop the next time I go back."}
{"text":"You can find Steve's Gyros on this map of Westside Market all the way on the right, in the middle (http://westsidemarket.org/wp-content/uploads/WSM-Map-and-Directory_JUNE2014_websitedownload.pdf).   I visited Westside Market spontaneously the other day around 10am and was pleasantly surprised to see that not only was Steve's open, but there was NO LINE. After a few minutes weighing whether I was hungry enough for an extremely early lunch (I'd already had breakfast) against the fact that I might never again see this opportunity, I took my place in front of the counter.   Normally I would have stood there for another few minutes pondering what to order, but Steve's really simplifies things for the indecisive customer because you really only have two choices: a Regular Gyro, or a Jumbo Gyro. [You can also purchase a soft drink, water, a four-pack of pita bread, and extra sauce/bread, but I digress.] Before you start asking about customization be sure to read the Rules on the counter because they have reserve every right to refuse service to an overly picky or unfriendly customer. And also, bring cash.  I was asked whether I wanted \"everything on it\" and nodded because I figured they knew their product best. I saw heaping portions of lettuce, tomato, and onions (oh, my, God the amount of onions in there) thrown in - but the biggest heap of all was the spiced lamb. Then came a generous lather of creamy sauce. The foil-wrapped end product was comparable in size to a Chipotle burrito. And price, since the regular is $8. I was handed my gyro in a brown paper bag with two napkins - but I could definitely have used more because eating was a REALLY messy affair. The Regular was enough to sustain me for the next five hours.   Okay, I have a confession to make: I don't like lamb. But Steve's is Steve's and there's no alternative, so I went with my gut (which actually makes many of my life decisions) and decided to try it.   I loved it - I would have loved it more if the pita was heated. The strips and chunks of meat were flavor-blasted to perfection with spices and didn't have any of the heavy, gamey flavor I was hesitant about. The sauce - I'm not even sure what was in it, but it was well-balanced without being too rich. I might have overdosed on onions during this meal, but the little pieces give such a satisfying crunch and aroma to the rest of the meal I'm tempted to coerce you into getting them even if you don't like onions. Beware the after-breath though!   If you have the opportunity, I'd definitely give Steve's Gyros a try. They've worked out the recipe for a no frills tasteful, texture-ful, (over-)filling meal that you can eat on the go. Now, if they only had late-night delivery..."}
{"text":"Ahhh, this was a tough one! The first time I had it, and waited in line for 30 minutes it was awesome and totally worth the wait!  The second time I had it was a shorter wait, still really good, but not great.  This last time I went there was no wait, and we both agreed it was just \"okay\".  I'm not sure if they are going down hill, the novelty for us wore off, or it is inconsistent and the last few times were just on bad days. It's a bummer, and I'm not sure with all the other choices I am going to chance it again!"}
{"text":"Pro Delicious gyro Lots of meat in the Jumbo   Con When I asked if they had hot sauce, I was told no (which would have been fine), however the employees started talking about how crazy it would be if they offered options like hot sauce... The way they were speaking made me uncomfortable and is the reason the service is a con"}
{"text":"Hands down! Super D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!! Truly the best gyro that I've ever had. Line was quite long but was moving in a decent pace. Their gyro definitely worth the price. Lots of meat but they did add lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. Not an onion fan normally, but it surprisingly goes really well with gyro! For sure would return if I ever get a chance to visit Cleveland again!"}
{"text":"I gotta be honest with you, the lady working the cash here was a complete dirtball and had a f&$^$ing attitude to go with.  But I dig it you know, because I'm a Gyro guy and that was one of the best Gyros I've ever had.  So keep doing you boo boo. I'll be frequenting this place for sure."}
{"text":"Visited Steve's Gyros after seeing them on the travel channel years ago. Well, finally made it to the West Side Market and shared a gyro. The meat is spiced well. Like it leaves flavor on the tongue between bites. It's a sloppy mess so feel free to have a seat while eating it. We knew when walking into the market that we were not leaving without this gyro, but we didn't know where the stand was located. So take your time, shop the vendors but save some cash as this gyro is cash only. The employees were friendly taking our order and we were promptly served a huge freshly shaved off the spic snack.  Being this was my first time ordering I actually had to look at the menu. As you can see in the pictures, there are house rules and small notes essential saying no customizations no substitutions. If felt that the sign was a bit blunt, but again the service was friendly and they just want to keep the line moving.  Tip: Try not to pig out on your gyro as soon as it transfers to your hands. Find a location sit, maybe the benches outside as not to drop your fillings everywhere. Just don't let the pigeons getcha."}
{"text":"One of DA best gyro's I've ever noshed on. Really. The meat is moist, seasoned and slightly charred all at once. Love how they lightly fry the pita as well. Don't just stand there and look at the line...get in it! A must."}
{"text":"You will wait in line.  It doesn't take that long though.  Be very sure that you are hungry enough to eat a Jumbo Gyro before you order that size.  It is at least twice as much meat.  I was full for the rest of the day.  So good."}
{"text":"I hate standing in lines. I hate standing in lines even for good food.  I will stand in line for 3 hours for Steve's Gyros if I have to. Though, I'm more apt to cut in line and threaten to stab a bitch if they dare tell me to go to the back of the line.  Steve's Gyros are amazing. I've been eating these things for 6+ years now, back when he only had the little corner stall at WSM. Better than average sex."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome gyro's with enormous portions! Only problem West Market has no real indoor seating to eat what you buy which needs to be remedied.."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! The line is always long and moves slowly but it's totally worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Coming from Michigan and spending an entire generation in Greektown, these are really great Gyro's (pronounced YER-row). Possibly the best I've ever had. Big enough portion for two people,  seasoned perfectly and a perfect zap to the sauce. 5 stars. I felt bad for the one Latina girl who single handedly makes every gyro when the line gets 15 deep, while her colleague corrals and manages the line instead of helping make sandwiches. Plan on waiting 20 minutes on a Saturday."}
{"text":"I was just watching a chef's favorite things program. Steve's Gyros once again earned nation wide attention as one gruff female chef  stated a gyro from Steve's is the best.  My five stars rating is for the ability this small stall has for gaining fame and fortune for not much. The Madonna of gyros.  On a recent Wednesday there was no line at Steve's. I figured why not try one? I took the gyro up to the balcony. First I had to do the Slyman's adjustment by taking almost half the meat off. I found it highly salty, a texture more like hot spam than lamb or beef. There was a shop in Lakewood that made gyros from skewered slices of real meat. It has closed. Even tho I loved those gyros people prefer Steve's hands down.   One more time I am out of step with my city. I bow down to success."}
{"text":"Price went up to $8 for the regular, but I didn't flinch.  Amazingly, only about a 20 minute wait on a SATURDAY around noon.    BEST GYRO ANYWHERE"}
{"text":"The subject of many songs, such as Chicago's \"If You Steve Me Now\", Michael Jackson's \"Steve Me Alone\", Belinda Carlisle's \"Steve A Light On\", Sheryl Crow's \"Steve in Las Vegas\", and the classic \"Don't Steve Me This Way.\"  Despite all the hype and it being on the travel channel, I actually found this to be one of the most bland and uninteresting Gyros I've had. Gyros are supposed to taste of spice & seasoning - not just like hamburger meat.   Sure, they put enough meat to feed a small country for several years on this Gyro, but for me, quality is much more important than portion size. I'll give the 3 just because it is pretty huge - and it's not the worst thing I've ever tasted. Still, if this is the best Gyro you've had, you don't know Gyros.  But I have to say that being on the Travel Channel and Food Network seems more conducive with bad quality than good. Really makes you wonder why people watch that stuff. I guess they just don't know any better."}
{"text":"Prepare yourself to be blown out of this world. The gyro herer is incredible! The lamb and beef meat, the secret sauce in a wrap are out of control. Be prepared to wait in line but be patient, this gyro is worth the wait. It is inside the west side market so do your shopping and have a great lunch."}
{"text":"I Love their Gyros. There is usually a line but it's worth it. Trust me. They are huge too."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing.  If you can find a parking spot and can wait in line for 5-30 minutes for a gyro, then you MUST go here - make sure to bring at least $7 in cash, though.  They are to gyros what Chuck Norris is to kicking ass.  The lamb was juicy and perfectly seasoned.  The veggies were nice and fresh, too.  Easily, this is the best gyro in the Cleveland-Akron area, with only Euro Gyro in Akron even coming close."}
{"text":"I honestly do not get it.   The gyro: Good.  In fact, I'd say the meat is very good. Cooked very well, with crispy bits and juicy bits.  Slightly spicy, and delicious.  Good portions. The lettuce was fresh, the tomatos not so much, and the sauce...eh.  Take it or leave it.  I prefer the more authentic yogurt based sauces.  The actual experience: Wow, when people said it'd be a wait, they weren't kidding.  In fact, I think the stall keeps people waiting on purpose.  There's only 2 people working in the stall, and only one girl making the gyros.  I don't quite know what the other one is doing, but she seems to be cleaning stuff...walking around...telling people it will be a wait.....  The girl making the gyros...slow, not very efficient, and will take cell phone calls should she get one, and your gyro will have to wait.  $8 for a regular and $10 for a jumbo (yep! prices go up when they get on TV!).   All in all, good gyro, but definitely NOT with the 30min wait for 10 people in front of you and the germs from the girl's cell phone."}
{"text":"Not sure where Steve is but he needs to crack the whip on his lazy slow ass help! Long line and the help is talking on their phones! Sauce was great but the meat was a bit salty for my taste. Stood in line for 40 min hoping for greatness and it fell way short!"}
{"text":"Whenever I visit Cleveland,  I always make sure to carve out some time to visit the west side market and grab a Gyros from Steve's.  Unbelievable tasty! I've managed to get there when the lines weren't too bad,  but it would definitely be worth waiting for."}
{"text":"So what would be the worse thing about visiting Cleveland? No, it is not the weather, the lack of entertainment or human beings on the streets.  It's going to the West Side Market, trying to check out the famous Steve's Gyros, and being yelled at every few minutes while standing in line and waiting.  First of all, and I hate to be a bubble burster here, it's a gyro sandwich, not a brain surgery.  It takes about 35 seconds to make for a low level thinker, yet somehow between being screamed at \"clear the ramp!\" and \"stay in line!\" by an unattractive lady with dirty looking hair and ridiculous waiting time, we have lost our appetite. Such attitude towards potential customers is unacceptable at best.  And why would you treat people in such a way? In the current declining economy, customer service is not just important, it's paramount.  So please adjust your attitude, wash your hair, and stop your stupid screaming."}
{"text":"OMG I promise you there is no over hyping this place if you dig yourself a little thing called the gyro. I can't even begin to imagine the number of times I would eat here each week. Well maybe each month?   The meat is cooked perfectly and you're served more than a fair portion. Per other people's suggestion,  I would get the jumbo (to share between 2 people) and then just get an extra pita for the $1 extra. We did not get the 2nd pita...mistake... as then you might as well have a fork for all the ingredients that won't fit due to ordering the jumbo. Lesson learned.  The woman working was extremely friendly and we lucked out by arriving at like 2 ish on a Monday when they weren't mobbed. My suggestion is go check this out the next time you're in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Super long line but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"You may wander into West Side Market a think to yourself, where do I start. Some will say take a look around, browse the fruit and vegetable stands, if you're hungry my vote is to head straight to Steve's Gyros! You can't miss it, as its right in the back from the formal front entrance under the hanging flag. If you still have trouble finding it, just follow the smells and the long line you can't miss!  I have a sweet spot for gyros ever since traveling around Europe as my go-to meal so after hearing about a local gyro joint, it peaked my interest.   We came around Saturday about 11 AM and the line was starting to wrap around the back on the ramp. We expected the line to move fast since they only had a few items on their menu and surely it did minus the few pauses when they were preparing more meat. There are only 4/5 items to get on the menu but go for the gyros (about $5-$10)! Totally worth it, they pack a lot into each and had me filled. Definitely hit the spot and will be back if I'm ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Stopped there on a Friday and was shocked there was no line...ordered the jumbo with no lettuce for $10...huge portion and the wrapped pkg resembled the final product you get when you go to Chipotle, a huge aluminum foil bomb....I got home, opened up this monstrous gyro and couldn't even eat it with my hands....I had to get a fork and pick at the meat til I had a manageable sandwich I could bite into to enjoy......my main beef is the meat is way over seasoned....it reminded me of eating peppered beef jerky but with a softer texture...the orange colored tzatziki sauce probably has a touch of sriracha but was not overpowering...overall it was worth the trip....AGAIN IT IS WAY TOO SEASONED..."}
{"text":"My rating comes from high expectations and anticipation. (Stemming from rave reviews and seeing it on national TV...)  I went during lunch on a Monday, didn't have to wait too long, maybe 5 minutes if that. So far, so good...  Got the gyro with the sauce, all the options (tomatoes/onions), and it was really just a huge pita with a ton of meat. Nothing about this gyro set itself apart from the others I've had. It certainly doesn't compare to the BEST gyro I've ever had- Uncle Gussy's Food Truck in Midtown East, NYC. Steve's was just a massive amount of meat I couldn't even eat in one sitting. It did make good left overs the next day, but honestly a Fergie's gyro in Parma is just as good."}
{"text":"After seeing an episode of Man vs. Food years ago, I literally started drooling at the TV after seeing Steve's Gyros preparing one of their delicious Gyros complete with all the fixins.    After years of bugging my Cleveland born husband to take me, I finally got to go this past weekend and it was worth the wait.  The meat was moist and full of flavor.  The tzatziki sauce wasn't to thick or runny, more of a just right texture to compliment the wrap.    Now make sure to grab the napkins for this one.  It is stuffed full of goodness so it might get a little messy.  I suggest eating in the upper level seats.  It gives you a good eye view of the hustle and bustle of the market.    I would have taken a picture...but all I wanted to do was dig in immediately. You will understand once you get that masterpiece in your hands.  Plus my fellow yelpers have that part covered.    Tip: Steve's is cash only."}
{"text":"The best!!!!!  So fresh and tasty.  Fresh pitas, fresh sliced tomatoes, you just can't beat the gyro meat and the sauce isn't the normal cucumber sauce, it has a bit of tang to it which really brings all the favors together.  There can be a long wait but the market has lots of people watching options.  Get the jumbo gyro it's so worth it. Order quickly and move down the line so that you make the process more efficient."}
{"text":"I love the gyros. The sauce is not your standard gyro sauce but I love it. The fill the meat to the max even for regular size. This is my favorite gyro of all time. The negative is they don't have a location  outside of the Westside market and therefore you a stuck on the markets times and days open and there are very long line waits (45-60 min) most the time I come. I get it that that's part of the stigma and history of being a small shop in the Westside market but I would love if they branched out. I hear that Steve is older and retired but maybe partnering up with a businessman/entrepreneur who would be willing to fund and run a free standing restaurant would be successful. I would personally invest in it if Steve were interested."}
{"text":"BEST GYRO EVER!  And I have had many.  I bring my out of town friends here and they all agree.  Just hate the line of \"local\" tourists that finally have come down here because they saw it on some foodie show.  Out of town I get, but if you live in the region you should explore and know your region.  Ok, off my soap box.  Must eat this gyro perfection.  Always tip!"}
{"text":"So, for the Gyro enthusiast, Steve's is the place! TONS of meat on the regular or the jumbo Amazing Taste.  So much garlic. Fresh onion and tomato and a unique tzatziki on warm pita. The line gets busy sometimes. So if you're in a rush, get their early.  It is cash only but for a stand in the Westside Markets, Steve's is spot on taste and quality"}
{"text":"Yum. It's nearing lunch time for me and I wish I could have one of these puppies today. Thinking about it makes my stomach feel like it's eating itself.   There is a line, yes. It's funny to hear passersby comment on the massive line at Steve's. \"Wow, this must be good. Look at the line!\" And people in the line are nodding in agreement.   It's $8 for a regular gyro, which is HUGE btw. Anyone interested in growing a muffin top? If your belly can't handle it, you better just split it with a friend because it is a lot of food. I cannot even fathom eating the larger one. It's more than enough.   The meat makes it. Really it does. It is tender, and cooked to perfection. The outside is caramelized and some of the pieces have this awesome crunch to it all while being juicy and flavorful on the inside. Wrap that in a soft pita with some lettuce, tomato, and onion and wow. And also, let's not forget the delicious sauce with a little spicy kick.   Not gonna lie. I want another one and I just got my fix on Saturday."}
{"text":"One of if not the best gyro I have ever had. They won't cut them in half so you have to eat the whole thing yourself :) I like their sauce. I had never heard of them I just saw a very big line and was hungry. I figured if that many ppl were willing to wait in that line it must be good so I got in line too. The only thing I would do different is I like my gyro meat crisped up on a griddle but they are so busy this would be impossible. I would wait in line again."}
{"text":"Saw reviews and several tv props to this place so had to try it..got to the market headed straight here..it was 1230..got gyro at 1..yes I waited a half hour..the owner was alone so u was willing to wait..it was def worth it...it got mine with no onion..there was so so so much meat I had to pick at the meat till I could actually pick up the pita..great flavor with a slight char (would of probably had more but being so busy it did not sit on the spit long)..the tiziki sauce was great different then the average with a little heat to it..super messy but oh so yummy I enjoyed mine while we walked around..would def recommend even for a half hour wait!"}
{"text":"Meh. We waited 45 minutes before they closed on a Saturday afternoon. The regular gyro sandwiches that we ordered had GIANT chipped beef hunks, and not the usual slivers of thinly sliced meat. When we opened the foil, at least half a pound of meat came falling off the top of the poorly assembled, abysmally rolled sandwich. Maybe this was because it was towards the end of the day and the crew just wanted to GTFO, but I won't be coming back to find out if that was the case."}
{"text":"If you're into gyros, this is a great gyros, but make sure you have plenty of time, because the line in this place is a big struggle. It's variable, but you may need to wait between 30 and 45 minutes during busy hours. Then again, worth the wait, if you're a gyros fan. The jumbo gyro is really jumbo, so maybe try the regular one the first time you visit."}
{"text":"$9.00 for a jumbo gyro? You betcha! I'll do it again and again (my wife and I split it).. What you've got to worry about is talking to people after the taste explosion in your mouth. Surely, if you are at the West Side Market, go get a gyro from Steve's. Stand in line (smell the fish) if you have to. Not one for gyros? Try Steve's, it may change your mind."}
{"text":"Had a gyro here, very good, I don't know how anyone could eat a jumbo, the regular ones are huge, my daughter and so-in-law managed though. Little place in west side market, people lined up around the corner, it'd be a 5 star place if you could sit down somewhere other than with the pigeons"}
{"text":"Believe the hype. I've been obsessed with gyros for probably the past 25 years. And I have finally found my nirvana, my food joint zero. Usually when a place has this amount of attention, it's overhyped in a bad way. Not this beautiful little stand. I can't believe I've lived in Cleveland for over 10 years and have never made a pilgrimage here. The taste was in my mouth for the rest of the day and I hesitated eating anything else because I wanted to remember it that bad. Yeah, it's that good. If I had no regard for my heart health, I would eat this for lunch every single day."}
{"text":"The gyro is indeed delicious and huge. I got the regular and I felt it was already stuffed with meat so I think the jumbo would have been WAY too much meat for me, considering they use the same pita size. I think the star of the dish is the sauce, which I think they mix in a hot sauce (siracha?).   Everything else about this place is a 3 star at best. Starting with the service, which is a bit aloof and arrogant with their list of \"rules.\" It's crazy slow (why have only 1 person rolling the gyros??) which causes long lines that move like molasses. Maybe it's intentional so people can see how popular this place is. The falafel nearby, I swear, has as many customers and the wait is MUCH faster.   Just because it has been featured on a couple of TV shows doesn't mean service should be crap. Yeah, the gyro is pretty good but I don't want to go through that line again when I can have amazing falafels so close by."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the best gyro I've had...ever.  I'm pretty picky about my gyros in terms of everything from the meat to the veggies to the pita to the sauce.  The gyro meat is flavorful and comes in larger-than-normal amounts.  There's a good balance of tomatoes and onions and the pita is a great blend of fluffy and crispy.  Their special sauce was absolutely incredible and a unique, sloppy way of topping off an already fantastic gyro.  As with all Westside Market establishments, be sure to get here early so you don't have to wait in line and painfully watch others eat.  I'm not entirely positive, but I'm pretty sure that it's cash only."}
{"text":"Featured on man vs food and lives up to the hype! There tends to be a long line but it is worth it.   They pile heaping amounts of meat on the gyro that you have to figure out a plan to maneuver your mouth through it. It is definitely a two hand job, holding the base to ensure that the precious meat does not fall to the ground.   The sauce has some type of crack in it because we kept wanting more!   We opted  to sit up top overlooking the market. Good stuff indeed!"}
{"text":"I cant believe people flock to this stand just cuz it was on a frickin TV show..  I have friends who have owned stands in the Market for years and know for a fact this guy has had health code issues.  Before that show aired this stand was a joke.  If ya wana see something fun check out when dudes daughter and her friends are getting hammered and acting sloppy in the Market Cafe bar.  Now thats a sight to see.  Cmon people, dont be sheep...there are better gyro places in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I was walking through west side market when I saw this place with their signs saying they were on Man vs. Food. Needless to say, that was enough to convince me to eat there, and I'm so glad I did! 8$ for a regular gyro, it was so filling and delicious, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If gyros were human, Steve's gyros would be the ultimate bad boys.  I'm talking 300lb bikers sporting gleaming Harleys and leather jackets, face tattoos and beautiful beards.  Nobody with half a brain would mess with them.  They'd emanate garlic fumes.  Everything they touched would turn to garlic.  You'd turn to garlic if you stood in their path, and you'd like it.  In short, for the mind-bogglingly simple combination of meat, veggies, and sauce nestled in a warm toasted pita, these babies are FIERCE.  Fiercely fresh, magnificently massive and definitely not for the faint of heart (or breath).  The meat, carved off the turning spit right before your eyes is succulent, salty and packed with garlicky marinade magic.  (A jumbo gyro will give you practically a pound of meat--enough to feed at least 3 people with healthy appetites.)  The lettuce, tomatoes, and onions aren't anything fancy--plain, crisp and fresh, the perfect compliment.  Even the tzatziki sauce is rather mild, melding nicely with the other flavors. Wrapping it all up, the fresh pita bread is pan-toasted with a pat of butter, adding one final, roasted, almost nutty dimension to the whole kit and kaboodle.    When I make my pilgrimage to Steve's, it's a well-practiced affair and one of my favorite Saturday rituals.  The order: two jumbo gyros, an extra pack of pita bread and an extra container of sauce.  20-40 minutes in line canoodling on my phone, admiring the efficiency of the two talented ladies who run Steve's and the brawny, waders-modeling fishmongers at neighboring Kate's Fish.  Then, sweet success: shuttling home a steaming, pungent 3lb bag of gyros and pitas to feed the man and me and stink up the kitchen for the next 3 days.  Steve's might not be the best gyros on this planet but they come pretty damn close.  Yes, there's excruciatingly long lines during Saturday peak hours, but that's a small price to get to Gyro Heaven, USA.  Viva la Cleveland!"}
{"text":"The best gyro I've ever had. Coming from NY, where food is abundant and immaculate, nothing beats the gyros here. Not an ounce of fatty meat, fresh raw onion and tomato, and the best gyro sauce you will ever taste. And the regular size was the size of my head! They're huge, priced just right, and will make you crave a million more!"}
{"text":"holy moly. i never thought i'd stand in a line for 45 minutes in cleveland to get a gyro of all things. this line was a monster. as was the gyro i got at the end of it.  steve's gyros is located in the westside market among a bunch of other amazing food stands. just waiting in this line brought business to the other stands next to it. we got some popcorn, fresh juice, and purchased and got fresh fish cleaned while waiting!   most of the wait was because the meat wasn't cooking fast enough for the demand! they had 3 heaters that would spin the meat and cook it. at the right moment the ladies would shave it off and cook it. i really appreciated that the lady would shout out the reasons why things were slow. it just made me a little more patient by knowing that  the pita was a little greasy for me. actually the whole thing was dripping grease out of the foil. but i ate it up anyway! my gyro was so huge and the ladies gave me so much meat i HAD to take some out. there was no way i was going to get a single bite of anything but lamb if i didn't take some out. they loaded it up! the foil could barely hold in all the meat!   ***please note: there is a sign that does say your serving depends on your attitude**** so don't waltz in there feeling entittled to anything. cause you migth get the opposite of what you asked for!  they also have these very strict rules about their business. no cutting in half. no ordering for others. better follow their rules or you'll be leaving empty handed! why? \"because i said so\" as their little sign explains"}
{"text":"Most delicious gyros ever! The meat was so tender and literally melted In my mouth. There was heaps of meat on it too!  Only downside was the service...the lady behind the counter was a bit rude and there was only one person serving"}
{"text":"5 Stars because it IS the best Gyro I have ever had. Period.  The meat quality and flavor is outstanding, the Tzatziki is theeeee best and the portion you get for just the regular is more than enough (the jumbo can feed a small army).  There is a very valid reason for the crazy line during lunch time...The Gyros are THAT good!"}
{"text":"I admit I never waited in the line until I saw it featured on the food network. I am a follower I guess...   Steve's did not disappoint and I can defiantly see how it would end up on man vs. food! I suggest not getting the extra meat and maybe getting an extra pita for the regular size one :)"}
{"text":"The BEST, bar none sandwich on the planet!  We love the West Side Market, but our visit has to start with a regular gyro which I share with my wife because the portions are huge.   Don't talk about ambiance and all that-it's a food stand with the best sandwich on the planet!  After all, the long lines are tell-tale!  Get there early!"}
{"text":"Best gyro I have ever had. That's hurts to say due to growing up eating an exceptional gyro my whole life. That being said this one was amazing. The meat was crispy and flavorful. The pita was nicely toasted and the sauce was great. It is a gut bomb, the size of a chipotle burrito so don't be surprised by the $9 price tag. The downside. It's a real mess. I stood upstairs to tackle the beast. Big mistake. Find a comfortable spot and grab a lot of napkins."}
{"text":"Ok, so gave up on long line after walking up front and seeing the ONE person making gyros for a huge line. She was molasses on a cold day slow and didn't really seem to care about the line or making money. There was another person behind the counter who may or may not have been affiliated with this place, who stood, arms folded leaning on a counter with a surly look on his face. Yes the gyro looked huge, but it was also $8. Falafel place around the corner was awesome and the people there were friendly and busting hump to get food out."}
{"text":"Get the regular because it even has too much meat. Once you have less meat get to the pita and veg you won't believe the flavor. I wasn't impressed with the non \"cucumber\"  sauce.  can't spell tsasiki..... who cares."}
{"text":"Went here this afternoon, approximately 11:40a, and only had 3 people in front of me.  However after I got my order, there were people lined up almost out the door for this place.  So, you'll want to get here either way before the lunch rush, or way after it.  When I came here, I thought \"should I believe the hype around this place?\"  Could  I trust Adam Richman and Food Network?  Well, the gyro lived up to the hype.  Costs:  $8 for regular, $10 for jumbo, $2 for soda.  I was hungry, so I thought I might order the jumbo gyro.  Then I saw the staff assemble the regular sized one, and it was so huge, I knew I'd never finish it, let alone a jumbo.  I ordered a regular, no tomato, no onions.  It was AWESOME.  Tons and tons of perfectly seasoned lamb/beef mix, an overly generous helping of Tzatziki, and not too much lettuce.  The meat was tender and juicy and not greasy in the least.  Be advised - as delicious as this gyro is...the taste will remain with you for the rest of the day!   (burp...'scuse me.)  The staff, despite some comments on this page, were very friendly.  The only complaint I have...and this isn't Steve's Gyros' fault.....is there's nowhere to sit and enjoy this awesome gyro.  There's a small upstairs section w/ a few benches to the WSM, but being a noob here, I didn't know how to get up there.  There are also benches in between the two buildings and a small park across the street, but all the benches today were in the shade and it was a bit too chilly to sit there.  So, I ate it in my car.  There was so much toppings on the gyro that much of it fell off onto my shirt and jeans as I was eating it.  Still worth it though.  Best gyros I've had, ever, so far.  BTW - cash only here, no plastic."}
{"text":"$8.00 for the meatiest, juiciest, and flavorful gyro! I wish that I paid more for the extra sauce! my only complaint!"}
{"text":"I've been BY Steve's a dozen times without stopping, because it is one of 2-3 places in the West Side Market that has a waiting line.....and with so many delightful food choices, I just couldn't justify waiting in a line.  I'm an idiot.  One moderately hazy morning, a small posse and I stopped by for the AMBROSIA OF THE GODS that is one of these gyros. Enough meat to choke a rhino? Check. Delicious garlicy taziki(sp) sauce? Double check. A person to split the Gyro with? Thank god for triple chick, because I may have OD'd, otherwise.  Delicious, fresh, and enormous. There is no better Gyro, anywhere. Take the time and wait for yours at Steve's.....you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Steve's is ridiculous. By some miracle I finally made it to WSM during a lull so the line was only 10 people deep. Of course I seized the opportunity to finally try a famous gyro. The hype is real. A \"regular\" is absolutely massive. I can't remember the last time I ate meat this good, shaved right off the doner. The sauce is really unique and totally delicious. Now that I've tried this once I will never again let a 40 person line keep me away."}
{"text":"More meat in a gyro than I have ever had!! Great taste and great sauce. I rated this place on food, not the ridiculous line I had to stand in to get it"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I went on a off day or fellow yelpers in the cleveland area have never had a really amazing gyro. Food wise I think Steve's gets a 3.75 to 4 stars, total experience its 3 stars for me.   For starters to get the gyro there was a 40 minute wait. This gyro in my opinion isn't worth a 40 minute wait. 10 to 20 minutes perhaps, but definitely not 40 minutes.   Food: The meat was good, well seasoned and tasty, however it could have used a bit more crispyness to it. The sauce is strange but good in its own special way. I do wish they put more sauce on the gyro. The onions are pickled in vinegar I believe so they have a nice kick to them. I also really like how they are cut so they give a nice texture. The pita however was soaked in oil from the meat which I wasn't a fan of.   Lasty as everyone said the lady behind the counter doesn't wear glove and has a lot of responsibilities. Such as cutting the meat, rolling the gyros, and touching money. Which freaked me out she touched the dirtiest thing in the world(Money) and my gyro. They also don't provide forks and this gyro can get messy with the amount of meat there is, and being they dont have tables to eat it."}
{"text":"Fat and greasy great for a hangover cure. I appreciate the quality and that the meat is shaved in front of the stand. Make sure you have some good reading material ready though if you know what I mean......"}
{"text":"Worth the wait.  WSM is good on its own but after walking around for 1hr plus its great just to dive into one of these gems.  Let me suggest NOT getting the extra meat, its just too much unless you plan on bringing extra shells home and dividing it up.  I ordered a large just to have a couple days later and it was much more manageable and delicious.  Make sure to get the sauce on the side though or else it will get soggy.    I am comparing Steve's to only 3 or 4 other places around town where I can tell you THEY DO NOT COMPARE.  Also get there early and get in line, they shoo'd a friend of mine away because they ran out earlier then expected.  Do yourself a favor, please, and go to Steve's Gyro."}
{"text":"Gave me the worst indigestion, and bad breath.  I've had gyros before and they have never bothered me, however I have been known to have a sensitive stomach.  The gyro was tasty. Their regular was impossible for me to finish.  I definatly prefer normal gyro sauce to their sauce. I went around 11:30 and there was no line at all. There is almost no place to sit, and this was very difficult to eat standing up.  We went upstairs and sat on a ledge, where their was a trash can, over which I ate to let the rediculous amount of lettace fall into the trash can."}
{"text":"Ok so I HAD to go to this place because I've seen it on the food network and I've had people rant and rave about the gyro's here. So I was in Cleveland recently and made it necessary to stop here and eat a gyro. I got to the place about 1:30pm and it's a good thing I did. I understand that the west side market place closes about 4pm? Or from what I'm told. Regardless, I didn't want to get there close to 4pm because I was also told that once they run out of gyro meat for the day they are done - and they usually run out before 4pm.   When I got on the line to get my gyro- I could see they had three spits going and two of them were empty and the third one was almost finished. So I assume I got there just in time to get a gyro. Now remember- these are things I've \"heard\" from people so I don't know for a fact if they just stop serving gyro meat when they run out even if it's way before closing time so you'd have to verify that when and if you go- but anyway- back to my story lol So they had meat left which I was happy about. The line wasn't long at all- just about 4 people in front of me. I liked the little sign they had on the table explaining the \"rules\" of what you can't ask them for haha So I ordered my gyro and they certainly do pack them! Holy crap lol You definitely get what you pay for!   My only complaint- we all know how messy a gyro can be. Sauce everywhere. They don't have any plastic forks or knives for the food!?  That was annoying actually. And on top of it- I didn't know this place didn't have any place to sit and eat the food. You gotta take all your stuff to go. Bummer. But upstairs I saw people sitting on this long radiator which actually over looks the entire market. So I made my way up there to sit on the radiator. Again- a fork and knife would have been ideal! So needless to say it was a big mess trying to eat this huge messy gyro sitting Indian style on a radiator. Good thing I grabbed extra napkins because I certainly needed it.   Over all- the gyro was delicious! I know the difference though. I'm from New York and I've had the best damn gyros you can imagine lol Everything about this gyro was exactly the same as any other gyro - EXCEPT the sauce. That's the trick here haha The sauce was similar to traditional Greek style tzatziki sauce but there was something different about it which made the gyro taste different- but still delicious. The sauce is also pinkish in color compared to it being all white. I almost ate the whole thing- and I can never finish one of those! So it definitely was good. No complaints about the food at all. Definitely grab one of these if you're in Cleveland! But be sure to get extra napkins- you're gonna need it."}
{"text":"Sooooo much meat. My parents and I got a regular gyro with sauce on the side and with a side of pita, and we pretty much made two gyros to share. One really has a ridiculous amount of meat. Anyway, the meat is pretty tasty and soft, though I would prefer it to be even more flavorful. The lettuce, tomatoes, and onions are pretty fresh and they give a pretty good amount of that to balance out all the meat inside. The sauce is really tasty too; it's not very heavy (I think it's made from yogurt). Worth a try if you're around the area! It's quite cheap; for $8 regular, $10 jumbo, and $1 side of pita (taxes all included), it's a great meal to share. Cash only though, so come prepared!"}
{"text":"Best gyro I've ever had.  Girls that run the counter are fun and nice, and the food was outstanding.  Expect a few minutes in line, but it's well worth it.  I'm a big guy and could barely finish the regular size.  Will go back anytime I'm in town."}
{"text":"After reading through some reviews I'm considering myself really lucky for never having to wait more than 10 minutes for this meat monster! Good timing I guess!  Believe the hype!  We usually just order a regular gyro to split, and make sure your splitting with someone who doesn't mind how you look while you stuff your face. Nothing pretty about trying to manage a gyro the size of your head, but it sure is delicious."}
{"text":"Best gyros I've had ANYWHERE! Worth the line/wait which can be for over 45 minutes. And the small/regular is big enough to be shared by two. A definite staple of the West Side Market."}
{"text":"I can't tell if it's good or bad. The line was so long, we waited 20 minutes and it never moved. People kept cutting the line. The lady running the stand kept bitching at people in the line to stay against the wall and behind a piece of tape. We did ( to leave a gap) but then people cut the line there thinking it was the end of the line. We got tired of being bitched at and not moving forward and left for somewhere else."}
{"text":"There was a huge line for this place so obviously I had to try it.  Smelled awesome walking past it too.  It's been on multiple shows AND has a giant line, so how bad could it be?  We got ours to go, along with some fresh pita for later.  Everything was great. The gyro was awesome, and there was SO MUCH MEAT in there.  Ridiculous. It is super messy to eat though, so get some napkins!  I think the prices are reasonable, especially for how much stuff they give you in it.  That being said, I didn't think it was the best gyro I've ever had in my life, though it came pretty close.  If I lived in Cleveland I would be back here often."}
{"text":"Other than finding parking that can challenging, I have nothing negative to say about Steve's Gyros.  The food taste and quality is excellent, the quantity of meat is, to put it plainly, very generous.  We went slightly early, around 10:30am on a Saturday and there were only about eight people in line.  The only disappointment was that from reading other reviews I sort of expected rude treatment, but that didn't happen.  They were friendly and efficient in preparing our order of three Jumbo Gyros with a bag of extra pita bread.  We took it all to our son's family home to share and we ate two meals from it for four adults and three kids.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was born in Ohio, and have mad love for the food establishments that grace this god forsaken state.  They don't have much to offer to outsiders and tourists but they do food very well.   If for some reason you do find yourself in Ohio, make a trip up to Cleveland and visit the West Side Market.  This place is an eye sore from the outside, but a jewel on the inside.  It is amazing all the foods you can consume, and I tried a little of everything from pastry's, cookies, pies, desserts, and super deep fried perogies, to olives, cheeses, bratwurst,  pulled pork and crepes.    I walked the entire market, buying everything I could that looked tasty or looked unique.  Everything was excellent, but I saved the best for last...Steve's Gyros.  The line for this place was ridiculous, I actually started waiting in line outside the market in the truck drop-off area, and was in line for at least an hr...probably more like an hour and a half but want to look at the positive.    Impatient, in a rush to get back to Columbus, and starving, I am getting anxious and psyche myself out thinking that these gyros will not be anything too special.  I order two gyros that are made with their special blend of lamb, beef and spices that constantly spins on a spic and cooks itself into this amazing, crispy, juicy meat and put into pita bread with Steve's own special Tzatziki, made with garlic, olive oil, cucumbers, and lemon.    Gyro comes super fat, with the biggest size only running you $8 which sounds like alot at first but is totally worth your money, and the taste of the gyro will tell you why.  I have always been a gyro fan but had no idea they could be this damn good.   The line was something that would make me consider never going back there but they are too freaking good!! Cleveland ROCKS!!! After receiving your gyro, take a seat on a table or sidewalk outside the market and dig in.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First visited about five years ago and it was a 4-star then, but is now a barely a 1-star. Probably still around cause of old TV appearances and people who don't know any better, this place serves gyros that are big in size but small in flavor. The meat used to be juicy and rich, but now tastes frozen or straight from a can. The pita isn't as fresh and the famed garlic sauce tastes like a watered-down version of its former self. Add the (not so cute anymore) \"rules\" and a non-appreciative apathetic attitude, and you have more than enough reasons to laugh at the velvet ropes.  Rating: 1 Janet Jackson album out of 5"}
{"text":"This is one of the best gyros I have ever had. Yes there was a wait. But it was so worth it. And their sauce is so good. It has it's own zing to the flavor that I have not found anywhere else. The meat has wonderful flavor.  It is ginormous. Enough to have a few meals from. I would definitely go again. And WILL!"}
{"text":"This was number one on foods to try while in Cleveland and boy it did not disappoint. Came here Saturday afternoon and the line was already long (although it was about a 20 minute wait). I decided on regular gyro over the jumbo gyro and it was the smartest decision ever because the regular is huge in its own right. Not only is it huge but simply great taste and I like the fact that the sauce has a little kick to it. Another thing I would say is to get the extra piece of pita bread because the sandwich is so big that it breaks apart. Overall yes this is one of the best gyro I have ever had and a must try while in Cleveland. All the big food shows has been here and I see why. Steve gyro is definitely the crown jewel of the west side"}
{"text":"My husband and I made it just in time before they closed!! We were def waiting on line for some time, but totally worth the wait!! Shared the \"Jumbo\" gyro with my husband and it was huge..we were both pretty full which was crazy because we can eat! Super delish!! Five stars for delicious food and awesome customer service!!"}
{"text":"My family and I try to get to the West Side Market once a month for grocery shopping, we always go on a Saturday (extremely busy) but so worth it because lunch @ Steve's Gyros.   Yes the line is long like all of the reviews say. Yes you can't cut your Gyro in half. Yes the staff can sometimes not be the best. BUT seriously this is GYRO HEAVEN!   We went last Saturday and we got lucky with the line being short. The staff was very friendly on this particular occasion. I ordered a JUMBO (enough for 2 people) gyro without tomato. The pita bread is fresh, the meat is tender and juicy and melts in your mouth. The veggies are a nice touch but like many say the SAUCE! It's not typical tzatziki sauce but more of a tzatziki with a little heat, its like crack, seriously can't get enough.   A regular is $8 and a JUMBO is $10 (well worth the extra 2 bucks). Make sure you have extra napkins as this gyro is messy, I would recommend that you also bring a pillow as you're going to need a nap once you finish in my opinion the best gyro around. Very deserving of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I powered through the 45 minute wait by thinking the gyro would be worth it and it was more than was. This was hands down the best gyro I have ever eaten. The meat was tender and way juicer than gyro meat usually is. The sauce was unconventional and delicious"}
{"text":"My review will mirror Fox E. Lots of meat but kind of bland. I follow Man Vs. Food around when I travel and Steve's Gyros was at the top of my list. I love Gyros and I love meat. My biggest decision the day before was to get a regular or jumbo. I settled for a regular which was still Bigger than I could eat in a single sitting. The meat was tender and moist. Veggies we're fresh. The taste just wasn't there. It wasn't bad... Certainly a mid or slightly better gryo, just not yummy noise creating goodness."}
{"text":"Another gem inside Cleveland's West Side Market.  Steve's comes in close second only to gyro carts in NYC in my best of Gyro category.    They have great texture and perfectly spiced meat...and like the wife said if the sauce was more plentiful I think it very close to the best I've ever had.  Come by Steve's for a bite, you could do a whole lot worse...trust me."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this. I've had gyros in 3 different countries and Steve's gyros beats them all. The meat itself is a light crispy blend that isn't too oily, and it's sliced nice and thin. The onions were cut a little too think but you hardly notice when your palate is being engulfed by the deliciousness of these gyros. The tzatziki  sauce is a great take on the traditional one but is more flavorful with a slight bite. It's a little hard to eat walking around the market but if you can find a good place to sit down and really enjoy you'll be rewarded. Yes the line is long but it was worth it.   Unfortunately the stellar product Steve's gyros put out is not matched with the behavior and attitude of the staff. The cook was nibbling and picking on food while she was cooking without washing her hands, and the front lady was handling money, them preparing your gyros without washing either. Neither of the ladies were very friendly but I imagine it's very stressful with a line that long so I didn't blame them."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a visit to Cleveland. We parked in the lot outside the fruit market. Steve's is on one end of the main market on the other side of the fruit market.  It's good for Steve's to be down on the end because the line was long enough to stretch up a ramp out the door. It would be a lot more annoying for everyone if the place was in the center of the market.  We got one regular gyro for $8 cash. It consisted of meat on a folded grilled pita with lettuce, tomato, onion, and their special sauce which tastes a little like thousand island dressing. It was big enough to feed two people looking for a light lunch and it tasted great. (We also stopped at a bakery booth on the way out and got a couple cookies for dessert.) The jumbo gyro was a couple bucks more and I can't even imagine how large that would be considering how much meat was in the regular.  What was wrong? Well... *The line was long and the service was not speedy. *The employee was not very friendly when asking us to line up in a certain direction. *$8 for a gyro is a little expensive. Yes, it tastes great. Yes, it's huge. No, I don't want to pay $8 on a regular basis for a gyro without a drink or sides.  This place knows it's famous and might not be treating its customers as well as it would if it was fighting for business. It was obvious that the booth occupants on either side of Steve's looked longingly at the line and wished it was their own.  Want the biggest and best gyro you'll ever have? Go to Steve's. Just don't be in a rush during a meal hour, know that you are just another person in a long line, and expect to visit other booths in the market to round out the meal."}
{"text":"Hanging out at the west side market can't wait to eat this gyro what great service because it is such a long line and yummy food"}
{"text":"Expect to wait in line but it moves fast.  CASH ONLY!! My husband and I have been here numerous times and absolutely love the Gyros.  It is fun to people watch and talk to people in line.  The Gyros come in 2 sizes regular (which is big) and Jumbo.  We split a jumbo and get an extra sauce.  They won't cut it for you --one of the rules--but we either bring a knife or tear it.  With either size it is one messy thing to eat so be prepared to have napkins at the ready. And remember Cash only."}
{"text":"Came in with some really high expectations.  \"Best Gyro you'll ever have,\" \"Food show X, Y, and Z have all come here,\" \"It'll blow your mind.\"  (I made up that last quote), but you get the point.  Everything we had heard coming here made me wary.  but it was TOTALLY AWESOME.  The regular gyro was as big as my head, I can't even imagine what the large look like.  It was delicious, there was a party in my mouth and everyone was invited.  The meat was perfect, the pita was soft and warm, the yogurt sauce was creamy and smooth... mouth is currently watering.   Eating here daily would cause me to be 400 lbs, but I would be a happy 400 lbs. Steve's Gyros = the real deal."}
{"text":"this is true Cleveland. No visit to the city would be complete without a Steve's Gyro. it's located inside the Westside market in Ohio City. I always get the regular but the jumbos available. These things are huge and delicious. always a line and expect to wait but totally worth it."}
{"text":"My husband is here on business with a group of colleagues - about 15 total. We all decided to head down to the market yesterday (saturday) and had a great time!  We all got gyros from Steve's. The line is about 30 mins on average (from what we've been told) but well worth it. The gyros are huge!!! I think the regular is like $7 and the jumbo is $9. Instead of getting two, my hubby and I ordered a jumbo and an extra piece pita bread for $1. Trust me, it'll be enough! Also trust me when I say you'll need that extra piece of pita bread. They load those things so full that even after splitting the contents up between two pieces of bread they were huge! My hubby finished his half and was thoroughly full, and I only ate like half of my half! And guys:  besides my hubby, all the other guys got jumbos and NONE of them came close to finishing them - although they were happy for the leftovers."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best and most awesomest place I have ever gotten a gyro from.  The down sides are you have to stand in line forever and you have to come early, but the up sides trump those 2 down sides.  They have humongous portions, which I LOVE, and the flavor in unbelievable.  This place was on Man VS Food and I can see why.  I can't wait to come here again and I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"Steve's Gyros broke my scale, guuuurl.  We waited in line for probably about 15-20 minutes and the order is simple: you choose a regular gyro or a jumbo gyro and either one will blow your mind. The jumbo is simply just more meat, and after watching them make the regular piled high with meat, we passed on the jumbo. There is no way anyone could eat it without getting food all over and/or making a spectacle of themselves. The gyro was amazing. We perched on the tiny 2nd floor walkway of the market and devoured it. This place is worth every minute of your time, so do not let the long line deter you!"}
{"text":"These gyros are the best lots of flavor and very juicy meat, sometimes the meat is too dry but not these gyros at Steve`s!! Waited in line for 20 minutes but it is so worth every minute of waiting. Can`t wait to go back"}
{"text":"Apparently this place is very famous? I'm not from Cleveland so that's perhaps why I've never heard of it until I tried it. I went on a Saturday, so there was a crazy long line...with one person handling the cash and making the gyros. It seems like they're banking in keeping a long line to give a desirability lure.  The gyro itself is indeed quite big. $8 for a \"regular\" gyro, which is essentially a large or jumbo at another place. The sauce is somewhat special...but it just seems to be tzatziki sauce with some hot sauce. Overalls, I enjoyed my gyro, but I didn't think it was THAT good. Not good enough to warrant standing in such a long line again. Not good enough to warrant getting waited on by seemingly misanthropes. They hae several signs up - one saying how they basically don't take any requests so you take it or leave it, another by the cash register emphatically stating nothing is free. I can understand not wanting to waste supplies since you're a small shop, but the way they write stuff sounds straight bitchy. If they're trying to appear rude and stingy, they sure got that down."}
{"text":"One of the top 5 best places to eat in Cleveland hands down. THE BEST GYRO YOU'LL EVER EAT!!!  I recently moved to Colorado from Cleveland and I think of Steve's gyros constantly. The only complaint I have is since they were on \"Man Vs. Food\" the price went up and the gyro got a little smaller but, still AMAZING. You haven't had a gyro until you've had Steve's."}
{"text":"I love this place. The gyros are huge and they don't pack them with veggies to fill it up! The meat is good quality and quantity. I will be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"I like to think that I know my Gryo's.  I've been around the Gyro block, if you will.  Gyro's and I, we're like two peas in a pod.  Ok, enough of that, right?  Anyway - I had made the assumption that there was no way that a Gyro could 'enough' better to warrent the extra money they charge AND the crazy line for this stand.  It's probably just all those lemmings that live in the suburbs and saw it on TV, right?  Nah.  This place is amazing.  Worth the line and the price.  The sauce had a little more kick to it, and even without ordering extra sauce (which I typically do) - I was really impressed by how it all worked very well together.  The meat was juicy and well spiced, everything was fresh and it was HUGE.  Huge enough that I couldn't finish it and my car smelled like old Gyro's for a couple of days (c'mon...you can't just throw it out!).    Grab a Gryo - walk up the stairs and watch the hussel and bustle of the market from the 2nd floor walk-way.    Now, this is Cleveland!"}
