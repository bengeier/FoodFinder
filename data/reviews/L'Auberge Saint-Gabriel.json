{"text":"Déjà réservé pour ce jeudi soir, on m'a dit le plus grand bien des lieux..."}
{"text":"I visited the Auberge St. Gabriel for the first time on a blustery September night.  We were a party of four: my husband, two out-of-town guests, and me.  We knew that the physical premises are impressive (see the many other reviews that talk about this), but we wanted to try the food because we need to select a restaurant for a group event that is being planned for later.  To dispense with the ambiance immediately, I have to say that it is indeed impressively \"old Montreal\", but I also found it too dark (I had trouble seeing the menu) and a little noisy.  
When I called to make the reservation, I asked if there would be choices on the menu for vegetarians, and I was told there would be, and I should ask the server.  There was exactly ONE vegetarian choice on the menu, so I assumed that the server would tell me what else the chef might do for me.  The answer was that the dish on the menu was my only choice.  When will restaurants learn to provide more vegetarian choices?!!  Among the options in the main courses there was one choice for me and I think at least six for the omnivores.  Also among the little extra perks that are offered -- there was a plate of twisted bread with chorizo, and afterwards a very pretty plate with some vegetable content but also containing salmon -- there was nothing suitable for a vegetarian.  In some restaurants I have been given a meatless tidbit when these little extras are offered, but I had the impression that at the Auberge St Gabriel the server never did process the fact that I do not eat meat.  It is a small thing, but it does reflect on the degree to which a restaurant caters to customers.
But we were there to learn whether the food is really good or not.  The bread was wonderful.  We were given a serving platter with bread and a bread knife, and this was left on the table throughout the meal, allowing people to cut bread if they wanted more.  We all started with the \"fresh mixed baby greens\", which was a very refreshing and copious salad.  My three companions all chose the same main course -- the lamb shoulder -- and pronounced it delicious.  My main course was the only thing offered to vegetarians -- Pasta Acini -- but I have to admit that it was delicious.  It consisted of tiny rice-shaped pasta, well coated with a green sauce that I think was made from zucchini, and in it were also tempura zucchini flowers, figs and almonds.  Creative and yummy.
Between the main course and dessert the Auberge offered us a macaroon and a small glass of cold cider.  Very nice!  
One of my companions chose the \"Abracadabra\" for dessert.  It was a chocolate-y confection with amaretto ice cream.  The other two both opted for the \"Pie aux pouces\", which included strawberries and mascarpone, with the novel feature that the server cuts it at the table in either one, two or three inch servings (hence the \"aux pouces\", which means by the inch).  I chose the simple \"chocolate pie\", which was anything but simple.  It was a rich chocolate construction and came with a spoonful of ice cream served on a square of what must have been chocolate shavings that adhered to the plate.  The ice cream was melted, but otherwise the dessert was delicious, like everything else.
There was a surprise for me at the end, when we received the bill and were ready to leave.  The server gave me a big brownie, wrapped in cellophane, and told me that it was for my breakfast.  I wonder whether they give a brownie to all women customers (I was the only woman in our party), or whether it was an offering to make up for having so few vegetarian options.  In any case, they made points (shall I say \"brownie points\"?) with that.  I ate the brownie today and it was scrumptious.
My overall assessment of the Auberge Saint Gabriel is positive.  Everything we ate was excellent, without exception.  The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is the lack of vegetarian choices."}
{"text":"I wanted to try old town French food so our local host selected this rather modern restaurant housed in an old inn.

They had a selection of three course prix-fixe.  A few appetizer items had an adder.  Pan fried foie gras was a $9 adder.

I select duck+duck.  The pate style foie gras was pretty good.  The duck was de-boned and quite tasty.

We had a bottle of NZ cab then OZ cab.  The NZ cab was a bit on the thin side but the OZ cab had body and robust."}
{"text":"Who is writing the reviews for this place?  The owner's nieces and nephews?  So, our first impression was very positive - beautiful locale in the old part of Montreal.  Thought had been given to making the restaurant a marriage between the old and the new.  

We started by ordering a bottle of wine, but the waitress came back and said she wasn't sure we would enjoy it as it was \"natural.\"  What in the world is a natural wine?  Thinking there was something lost in translation (even though I lived in Paris as a student and can speak some French), we ordered a different bottle of wine.  This time, the sommelier came to our table to tell us if we sent back the first bottle, we would definitely not like this one.  I politely reminded him that *we* did not send back the first (unopened) bottle, but that the waitress said we would not enjoy it and who would drink a wine after the waitress says it's not good?

The sommelier then said he would bring back a bottle we would enjoy.  We thought we would get an amazing wine.  My DH had indicated he liked full-bodied: Cabernets, etc.  The sommelier comes to our table with an OPEN bottle of wine.  That's right, it wasn't opened in front of us.  Umm.  Strange, maybe someone sent *that* one back.  Anyway, he pours us a sip tasting and it is a good wine, but very light-bodied. Something summery and drinkable, but not a fab wine.  After all that, we really expected something great.  Additionally, the sommelier never told us the price, nor showed it to us on the menu.  In all of my previous experiences with sommeliers, they will point in the menu at least one option (sometimes more than one option), and you order, knowing the price (whether it's $40 or $400).  So, not only did the sommelier have in his list wines that a regular customer would not \"enjoy,\" but he brought us an opened bottle, suggested a wine that was not along the wine that we wanted that evening, didn't even ask us what we were eating, and didn't even show the price of the wine brought to the table.   Very amateurish.

Fortunately, we just looked at each other, ordered mojitos, and the rest of the evening went off without a hitch.  The food was solid and interesting.  The main dishes were particularly good (duck and fish).  It was a little gimmicky - the waiter pours the sauces at the table (this could have easily been poured in the kitchen!).  I couldn't help but feel they were trying oh so hard to make an impression of being so sophisticated.  But, both the duck and the fish were well executed and the flavors were solid., so I know there is talent somewhere in that kitchen behind all that fanfare.  I just wish they would have the confidence that the food is good enough.  Because, right now the restaurant \"experience\" is an epic fail."}
{"text":"We were visiting Montreal on vacation and also as part of a family history tour.  We stayed in Old Montreal and L'Auberge Saint-Gabriel was on our list from the early planning stages.  The history of the building goes back 300+ years, it was close to our hotel and the ratings were excellent.

It lived up to our expectations in all categories.
The indoor dining area feels like you're in a pub in the 1600 or 1700's.  The service was excellent as we were taken care of by several different individuals during the evening.

We started with the Terrine de Foie Gras and Petite Charcuterie plates.  The foie gras was velvety smooth and luxurious in texture while being rich in flavor.  The charcuterie platter was a very nice selection of sliced cured meats, with a pleasant surprise here and there.
For the main, we had the prime rib for 2 and the lobster special.  The prime rib was enormous but perfectly done to our liking.  Flavorful but not overly seasoned or spiced.  Solid meat flavors with subtle seasoning.
The lobster was an entire crustacean, split and pulled making the whole thing much easier to work with.  The claws were a little effort, but that's expected.

It's not a cheap night.  But, L'Auberge Saint-Gabriel is a serious culinary event.

We enjoyed the atmosphere, service and cuisine enough that we'll be back the next time we're in Montreal.  Without a doubt."}
{"text":"My job takes me all over the world and I get to eat at some of the best restaurants the world has to offer. I can confidently say that my meal (the whole experience actually) was one of the best I've ever had. Truly unforgettable for all the right reasons: food, service, ambiance, crowd. This place sets the bar high."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!

We landed there for lunch completely randomly, just strolling around Old Montreal's small streets right after arriving into the city. 

The old brick building and \"table d'hote\" menu out front both attracted our attention.
Basically one picks a main course, and the appetizer and dessert come included (small supplement for a handful of items).

We were more in the mood for a sandwich or panini, but looking at the menu, we decided to give it a shot, and go for something lighter for dinner instead.

We walked into a wonderful old building, beautifully decorated (there is a majestic whale spine at the entrance), and were seated in the clear and reasonably  quiet restaurant room (it was probably half full)


For appetizer, we had the charcuterie (it was \"fromage de tete\" that day) and the salmon (almost like a sashimi, really). Both excellent, and wonderfully presented. 

For mains, we had the cod, with beans and a meat sauce (surprising at first, but really delicious and goes wonderfully with the flavorful cod), and the salmon, perfectly cooked medium-rare, with a few little fixings on the side (more for flavor).

For dessert, we had a chocolate panna cotta with raspberries and a St Honore cake with some apples (and again a ton of various flavors on the plate). The latter was the best and one of the most amazing desserts I've had in a long time.


The chef is really a master at presentation, and at elegantly mixing flavors that one wouldn't naturally imagine to put together.
I will also say that it is not all that common to find a restaurnant that excels at both savory food and desserts, so extra props for that.


This seems underrated today at 3.5, but again it's possible that the prices are much higher for dinner, setting expectations much higher... this review focuses on lunch, which costs CAD ~30 per person (+ tax + tip).

Service was excellent, friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This restaurant feels very underrated to me. It's located within a refurbished inn from the late 1600s and inside there is a great deal of modern art (not shown on their website). All the art, chandeliers and drapery mixed with the brick walls and wooden columns creates a really interesting dichotomy and ambiance. I ended up dining at the bar on my visit to L'Auberge Saint-Gabriel because the bartender, Adrian, was so attentive and helpful even though he was probably exhausted from the massive NYE celebration the evening before. All the servers were obviously knowledgeable and friendly and the highlights were the foie gras and the bison tartare. They give you baked snacks and complimentary desserts (not sure if it was just because of New Years but they were amazing). Adrian also made me a hot toddy upon request which perked me right up after walking in the winter snow for an hour. 

Great restaurant and I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here on a cold winter night. I was really impressed when I walked in. The ambiance is simply amazing and unique. The service was great and the food was even better. Easily one of the best restaurants in Montreal! 

If you can afford it, it is definitely a restaurant to consider!"}
{"text":"This is a favorite and one of the few places I come back to repeatedly (there are just too many good places to go in Montreal). I've eaten in the restaurant proper as well as the bar several times and it has always been excellent. 

As you walk into the restaurant you smell this amazing wood burning fire which I just love. It has a historic building ambiance with beautiful old brick, but really interesting modern touches with some of the design and artwork. The food is fantastic. Have tried several different dishes and it is consistently great. The charcuterie plate is highly recommended.

At the bar there is a really great group of people in front of and behind the bar. The staff is incredibly friendly, inviting and have a decent amount of regulars coming in to see them. There is also a party room (or 2?) for events so if that is of interest.... check it out. The downstairs is also a club later on in the evening. Have not been there (yet) when it is open, but it looks fab."}
{"text":"I've been going here, and taking guests visiting my company, for years. The last visit was enough. It started out well enough, but when we asked to change tables due to the noise, our waiter exploded. A rage of hateful disrespectful, words poured over. Specifically, exploded at my guest, a decorated epidemiologist who traveled a long way to meet our company and give a lecture at one of the Universities. 

I was stunned and I will never spend another dime at this place. Never."}
{"text":"We were a group of 8, and among us were a mix of Montrealers, past Montrealers as well as kids and parents. Overall, one must ignore the actual location and aura unless you eat old air!
The environment is beautiful as were the waitresses. I get it quebecois are attractive. The young men were also well coiffed. The service was a straight D. From moving our group to a better location, to an ability to relate to the anglos in our group, and even to the ability to bring food in a timely manner....well pretty sad! 
                As for the food, the halibut was a small oily smothered portion of boredom. The pasta dishes, a creamy mess. Overall for an engorged tourist ripoff price, we could have done better in many other locations within a mile of this golden location.My advice..stop in view the old beauty and move on to one of Quebec's many many excellent eating establishments, a place with a well equipped, mature staff able to give the international tourist a worthwhile experience."}
{"text":"Came here for Christmas eve dinner.  The place was beautifully decorated and very festive.  Love the fireplace/stove where you feel cozy, also the bread cart that you see the server prep for your own bread board.  

Service was great and the food was delicious.  I was worried first as it seemed like a place about the location and maybe not so much of the food, but I was wrong and happy that I was wrong.  Everything from the bread to the bill that comes with little treats was delicious and very nice presentation as well.  

The only downside is it seemed the manager is the only person who was in charge of the credit card machine, so it takes a long time for him to finally come swipe our card even though we got the actual bill a while ago.  But it's Christmas eve, they were quite busy and servers were all very nice and spot on with filling our water cups and refilling our jugs too.  

Filet was amazing. The cornish hen stuff with sausages was also unbelievable.  I love the oysters came in a wooden trough.  Desserts were light and delicious.  My husband enjoyed the bison tartare, but I think they could've shopped them up slightly finer than what it was.  Some of the pieces were a big too big for me to eat raw meat, although you could taste how fresh and lean the meat itself it.

Definitely recommend this place even though it may seem like a tourist trap with the location!  Food and service is worth it!"}
{"text":"Found this place wandering old Montreal looking for a place to eat lunch.  Menu looked good so we went inside.  It's a very cool mid evil/ trendy place.  Also had outdoor seat which was nice on a sunny day.  My girlfriend got a salad as an appetizer and I got the beef tartare which were good.  For entrees we had the salmon and lake dore which were also very good."}
{"text":"This has become a family tradition for my wife and I. Her family started bring us to Montreal and this restaurant ten years ago. We have a made a reservation each year we make the trip up here. The food has always been very well done and paired well with the other courses of the night. It is a great place to sit, chat with your party, and the one next you while dining for the evening. Each part of the meal is exquisitely crafted and brought to your table. The staff has been cultured to know when to check in and when to come back later. My wife and I are looking forward to returning next August."}
{"text":"We really loved this restaurant. As they say they are the oldest inn in  North America and one of the oldest bars, it was quite cool to see how they decorated mixing old and new. We visited for lunch as the prices are a bit steep, but lunch was great. The service was great, too. They do allow you to taste the wine you order before pouring you a drink, in case you would like something different."}
{"text":"Quirky space in a historical inn. I loved the art and installations pieces scattered throughout including custom furniture art...chandeliers tied artfully to the ceiling, globule shaped fireplaces, nooks for candles, a secret space under the stairs, several floors and a long medieval stone passage leading to a dungeon like basement.

Went here for a costume party and not the food. Totally different feel at night vs daytime."}
{"text":"This venue is absolutely amazing - stone walls, wood fireplaces, eclectic decor. Extremely cozy and intimate. While the food we ordered met our expectations, we found ourselves quite limited by the selection on the menu. I am certainly not alone in my dislike of mushrooms, so when we noticed that all four mains contained them, it was rather disappointing. My partner and I ended up settling on two soups and a large charcuterie plate, but had to struggle with the waiter to place this order. We were informed that this is not the proper French way to enjoy a dinner, and that we should in fact order more than would actually satisfy us. For the record, we understand what an appetizer is. Despite this, our server did succeed in pairing a suitable wine for our meal and was helpful in our dessert selection."}
{"text":"Just amazing is all i can say. You enter Auberge and feel as if your in a lodge built in the 1800's. Stone walls three feet thick  and huge beams. At least three huge fireplaces burning wood a d used to bake breads. After having a spectacular dinner which consisted of the following:

Beet and yogurt salad with goat cheese
Charturie platter( from snoot to trotters cachon.
Paella with rabbit, scallops, and assorted seafood. Wonderful seafood foam.,
Fresh baked bread, foccacio, olive baguette, sour dough baguette. Grilled cristini's for the pate's.

Good wine, cold vodka, and excellent service from the hostess to the wait staff. Very accommodating and friendly.

After dinner we decided to go to the lounge, and where surprised to find a club in the basement. Thick walls, DJ spinning all types of music. They have lounge style sofa's with bottle service. At 1am the placed was packed. Lots of fun and good music to dance to."}
{"text":"My date and I stopped in here for a glass of wine on the way to dinner. One word: luxe.

We were seated by the fireplace -- a great spot for people-watching. The entry way presents as a sexy lounge -- the dining room and area where we sat (eyeing the bread and cheese boards) was more rustic, with beautiful, long tables. Fabulous date night spot."}
{"text":"Refined New French cuisine in a chic & restored historic inn with think stone walls. Great cocktails, very cosy."}
{"text":"we ate dinner at the small front bar recently, this is a gorgeous place, even including the whale bones and unique suspended fireplaces, bartender was great as were the drinks, wife hat the bouillabaisse and i had the hanger steak i think it was, both were great and beautifully served, the dining room was lovely and you could watch the chicken slowly turning and the cauliflowers being basted with their juices,,,,nice!!!!"}
{"text":"The auberge is the oldest continuous use Inn in North America. That is the history behind it. The more impressive aspect is the beautiful old stone walls, now somewhat combined with a well-done modern bar area. The owners have changed in the last few years, but only for the better. The chef does seasonal menus using quebec style food. A great value in Old Montreal to show off the loacal cuisine. Gaetane is great to work with for planning large events on a budget in the Truteau room."}
{"text":"Excellent food, but worse service ever.  Spent over $416 on food and drink, even gave our server an underserved 15% gratuity.  The awful service overrided what could have been a great experience and a memory to take home. Instead, we will most likely not dine at this restaurant in the future.
The irony was that there was a food or wine critic beside our table who looked just as bored us.  There was a big lull in service for him, too."}
{"text":"My meal ranked amongst the best I've had.  Go with their recommendations, if your picky, tell them what you like & don't like...then sit back & enjoy the utopia that is L'Auberge.  Next time I am in Montreal I will be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I actually went to bota bota during MTL à table instead of this restaurant, but the food there was provided by l'auberge. When we got there, they were not quite ready yet, and they served food quite slowly. We waited for 30 minutes between appetizer and main dish. HOWEVER, I was very impressed by the taste of the food, so impressed that I could ignore the service inadequacy. I chose the mushroom soup, the risotto and the Black Forest cake. The cake was less good than the pineapple split cake. I'm not saying it was not good, but just not as good as the other one. The soup and the risotto were spot on....not mentioned the whole atmosphere, sitting on the river and looking at the city lights. It was a very good experience. I think I would visit the restaurant again."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing setting!! And the food and the staff were superb! 

We loved the entire mood that the restaurant has and the staff (especially the maitre'd) were fantastic and very welcoming.  I would actually list this place as part of any list of \"Must-See in Montreal\" based on how unique and wonderful it is.

You won't be disappointed - unless you're one of those types that is always disappointed....!!"}
{"text":"Mac n cheese is trash. When we mentioned it. They did nothing. I enjoyed my wine and crab cakes but since my fiancé didn't enjoy his mac n cheese. Nothing was done to fix it. We still paid for it but we will never ever come back here again."}
{"text":"TERRIBLY rude wait staff and absolutely nasty bartenders. The hostess greeting the people walking into the restaurant was sour. But whoever the  skinnier guy behind the \"open bar\" we payed $2,000 for needs to get out of the service industry. He was absolutely horrific. We had a group of over 40 people, prepaid (well over what we relieved) and were treated awfully the entire time. Shocked these folks are in the service industry. I do not typically take time to write reviews but as a visitor to Montreal, I was appalled. Some of the rudest people I have encountered. Will never recommend to anyone or go back here. Have been here for a week and this ranks as the worst stop."}
{"text":"Maybe our expectations were too high...

We did 8 course tasting menu with wine pairing which usually turns out to be a really  great experience. well in this case it was a total rip off!

We only got 6 of the 8 courses, the majority of which were not very good. A beaf Tatar with tomato sorbet that tasted like it was tomato paste strait from a can. Our main course was a tinny piece of beaf tenderloin half of which was over cooked, with a tinny piece of foie and a broken sauce. 

They served almost every dish on these awkward tiles that the servers struggled to clear every time. All of the wines served were mediocre and we had to flag the sommelier down 3 times so he could poor the wines they were paired with, as the food sat there and got cold, or in some cases melted. 

The cheese course was nothing but 3 small pieces of cheese on a plate put in the middle of the 3 of us to share, that's not a dish! Nor a course!

When we spoke to the sommelier about these concerns at the end of the meal he argued with us about it, and told of the champagne he gave us with desert ( a mistake in itself ) was a gift, as he was already over his budget on us. My god...

This dinner for 3 people was $613.00. From someone in the business this place is poseing as a fine dinning establishment. 

Never again!"}
{"text":"The Thai inspired summer menu is fantastic. The chef is brilliant and took the time to greet us at or table. Highly recommend this jewel in Montreal's Old City."}
{"text":"Decided to come here for our anniversary and we were not disappointed! The atmosphere and look of the old inn turned restaurant fits very well with the surrounding Old Port area. It's classy and upscale without making you feel out of place if you are not in black tie. We made reservations for a Wednesday night and good thing we did as it was pretty full by 7pm. The food is delicious and definitely not overpriced. The waiters were present without hovering. We shared the charcuterie plate, which, with all the bread they continuously brought out, could easily do one person for lunch, but was perfect for a shared app. My husband devoured his Cornish hen and my bouillabaisse was so flavourful. They substituted something in it for mini shrimps which sounded great to me! If you can, save room for dessert! We got the maple soufflé & poached pear which were both light but extremely tasty. I was so full by this point but then they brought out little petit fours with your bill, which of course were so good. We were both so happy with our meals by the time we left, we already said we had to come back! Highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"The highlight of our culinary experiences in Montreal. The ambiance, the food, the wine, the service, all fantastic!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant/bar in the entire airport.
There's a few new places to choose from now a days but I highly recommend this place.
Sandie is my fav! Hilarious quick and professional makes great drinks.

The seating in the back is to die for, bug over sized couches in red and black big fluffy pillows and a huge rabbit fur blanket for chillier nights.

Seating for dinning is a big space and the bar is great as well. The owner put a lot of love in to this place you can tell.

I've had a few items off the menu crab cakes club sandwich all which were great."}
{"text":"Been wanting to go to this restaurant for a very long time and was happy to get a couple of seats last night for the Montreal a Table festival (fixed menu for $41). Some of the dishes were spot on, but some were very disappointing. The wines we were served were ordinary. Not what I would expect from this restaurant. I´m sure, based on other reviews, that our case was exceptional and that usually this restaurant is awesome (they seated guests late, so my guess is that there was a problem in the kitchen). However, consistency is an important characteristic of a well ranked restaurant, and on this it failed. There are so many good restaurants in this city, I will not go back to this one - even at $41."}
{"text":"S'il vous plaît visiter, vous ne serez pas déçu.  Ce restaurant est incroyable dans tous les sens.

I stayed an extra day in ravishing Montréal do explore and taking int all in.  As I explored the amazingly beautiful and friendly city by foot I met a fellow Californian who ended up joining me on my explorations.  Since it was the last night in QC for both of us, we decided splurge in out last dining experience.  

How did we discover L'Auberge Saint-Gabriel, you ask.  We asked someone on the street who was unsure, but called a friend who had fine culinary knowledge. 

L'Auberge Saint-Gabriel is tucked up a side street at the old port in Montreal, thick stone and wood make for a beautiful facade to reputedly the oldest inn in North America.  It has the warmth of an old cottage coupled with quirky decor and creative menu items, both in flavour and presentation.  I rank L'Auberge Saint-Gabriel high amongst the dining experiences I've experienced... and not just for the food!

We were graciously greeted and seated at a lovely table in the dining room where we experienced impeccable service.  Our waitress was attentive and pleasant and out meal was accompanied with plenty of unexpected, amuse bouches along the way.  Our meals were well portioned and delightfully delicious, while appearing like art as they we placed at the table.  

The fun at L'Auberge Saint-Gabriel continued after dinner as we explored the decor and played on the playground like carousel in the restaurant lobby.  We were lured in the bar area for after dinner cocktails.  The bar area displays a large sculpture of two large moose that are joined at the neck and each are adorned with a light bulb.  The most fun of the evening was when we learned how to turn the lights on/off... this happens via the button in the tail end of the moose!   http://tinyurl.com/bl3v6on 

We had a grand time with regular patrons at the bar who helped us to continue the amazing experience.  We we toured through a dark and narrow tunnel from the bar to an underground area of L'Auberge Saint-Gabriel which is known as Velvet, a posh locale high roller club that is open Thursday, Friday and Saturdays.  To our advantage, we had the club to ourselves and were entertained by a staff member with a few songs via an iPod to but a few moves while enjoying the unique environment. The ambiance is simply amazing and unique, this is a one of a kind establishment that is amazing in every way.

Bon Appéti.  Au revoir!"}
{"text":"What a great opportunity for auberge saint-Gabriel to showcase its food and brand at the airport !!!  It's probably best in class in terms of airport food but it lacks a certain personality and fails to live up to the standard of the established restaurant in old port. I had a really nice meal, the salmon was well prepared but it's just not close to what the restaurant is and calling it a lounge isn't an excuse to skim on the experience. In terms of service well that's where it's bad, the waitress tried to rush me because her shift ended and told me to go to Starbucks if I want something other then plain coffee and there is only one dessert on menu . Basically you could just pretty much give it any name but again it's still one of the  best I've had at the Trudeau airport :)"}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to visit this historical restaurant located in the old port of montreal and totally fell inlove with it's ambiance.  We sat on their beautiful terrace . The inside of the resto is totally spectacular and super romantic. This is a great restaurant for marriage proposals !  Or simple anniversary , date or birthdays!  The inside feels like you are in a castle. The service is warm and friendly. The food was good overall and they have great Sangria's so perfect spot for drinks as well.  I would definitely recommend trying this place at least once as it will historically transport you to another era! Breathtaking and stunning!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is easy to miss along the main drag of Old Montreal. Nestled in North America's oldest Inn, the space does not lack character. The old stone walls and candle-lit fireplace harken back, while lighting, art and fixtures offer a bit more modern of a treatment. There's a dinosaur spine and other ultra-modern gothic fixtures. It's definitely trendy, and a little disjointed - but a cool space nonetheless.

Service was great. Our waitress made a mistake with our order and offered up some pro bono treats in exchange. She was excellent otherwise. 

The food was more of a mixed bag. At one angle, the presentation was excellent. Everything was done artfully and with care, as one would expect at such a premium price point. The flavors themselves were mixed. The rabbit gaspacho was amazing. The foie gras appetizer was beautiful, but mixed sweet strawberry flavors with the bitter/salty foie gras. It was one of the most intensely flavored dishes I've ever had, but not in a good way. Perhaps my pedestrian palate is not up to the challenge, but neither of us could finish it. Shame. 

Onto the main course, the lamb was perfectly prepared and tender, and the accompaniments were an interesting mix of distinct and strong flavors. This worked better as a flavor profile, but I felt the texture was wrong. Everything seemed a bit mushy. It needed some other texture to offset the tender lamb. I might not be this picky normally, but at this price level I expect more. She had a homemade pasta dish, that was very good - but overly simplistic ingredient-wise for the price level, and scant with the pasta. 

Overall, there were some flashes of brilliance, a great space, good service - but an ultimately underwhelming overall food experience for the amount paid."}
{"text":"Such a pleasant surprise and this was a wonderful cap to our final night at Montreal. Our server was friendly and did a great in explaining the menu while recommending some of his favorite items (that's important in order to reflect the server's enthusiasm about the menu!).

My husband and I started off with a dozen of refreshing East Coast oysters. Following that, the salmon tartare was light enough that it prepared us for the next items. Truly a fan of the creamy and smooth foie gras that I ate it just like that without the crackers in order not to ruin the pure taste of it. The halibut was of generous portion and the entire fillet was carefully and sliced and grilled. I really loved that the skin was still in tact when they grilled and presented the fish. We haven't gone the dessert route for a long time as we usually prefer to get another cocktail to end our night. We made an exception during this night since we enjoyed all the items that came out from the kitchen. No regrets at all and the pistachio olive oil cake was perfectly moist and not dense so we didn't leave filling like gluttons.

The space here is gorgeous and it's located in a historic building."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. Excellent plating. Excellent ambiance. What more could we want? For my full review, click here: https://therealmtlfoodie.wordpress.com/2017/11/14/lauberge-st-gabriel-definitely-has-that-wow-factor-mtlatable/"}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner, beautiful surroundings, and great service. We were thoroughly impressed. We started with the charcuterie platter (petite is big enough for 4 I think) and it was a handsome assortment of meats and veggies. The foie gras with apricots and raisins really surprised us - we didn't know we liked four gras! Next my husband had the filet - perfectly cooked and tender. His sweet potato gratin was delicious as well. I had the stuffed cabbage and it was delicious as well. The mushroom cream sauce really tied it all together. We had the chocolate pumpkin cake for dessert and a cappuccino- perfect end. The bathrooms were clean and for the first time ever o saw a dental floss dispenser! Wow! Intuitive idea for a steak house. Finally, I can not say enough about our wonderful server, Erich. A true gentleman and a perfect host for the evening."}
{"text":"Très beau décor, nourriture très cher pour le résultat dans l'assiette, service très long. Une visite suffit mais je n'y retournerais pas pour la gastronomie."}
{"text":"I was in the mood of treating myself to a nice meal. Took my car and drove to old port and thought of l'auberge saint Gabriel. Luckily it is not a busy night tonight. I found a parking nearby and called for reservation. They seated me on the bar. Went there. Nice dimmed light place, black colour walls and bar. Bartender was so friendly. He gave me the menu and I chose the hanger steak. Usually I eat well done he said it will not be good. I told him let it be as the chef recommends. He came with my order and recommended me he Argentinian wine. Combination is very good. The hanger steak is just what I wanted. I was in a rush but I will definitely go back to this place whenever I have more time. Thanks for the food and service"}
{"text":"Stumbled into this restaurant as it was attached to our hotel and could not find room anywhere else for two and with a sick 8 month-old. With that being said, I was skeptical at first since it was so elegant and chic inside (and also attached to a Marriott) but this place was hands down fantastic. Great service (Gale was knowledgeable and provided a top notch experience) and the food was on point. The atmosphere is also second to none. 

Expensive? Yes. Worth it? Yes.


We had the burrata - amazing dish for two and so many flavors 

Hanger steak - great flavor 

Bouilibasee - perfecto  

...and of course two glasses of Vueve"}
{"text":"The Conference i was attending had booked this place for a dinner evening. 'This place' is a mixture of a restaurant, lounge and then turned into a club later in the evening. It's truly top-notch. From the atmosphere to the architecture it was truly amazing. From the service to the food, it was simply perfect. This place is perfect for a corporate event (similar to ours) or a nice romantic time or even friends hanging out having fun. 
Truly amazing. Definitely a must on my next trip"}
{"text":"I went back to l'auberge saint-Gabriel and it still is a great place. I love how the floor is sroarate is sections and different little salon. My baby back ribs were a bit too spicy and I did drop a part of it  but that's my own clumsiness. Sorry, old historical creaky floor."}
{"text":"This is a review based mostly on service and ambiance - I attended a #prmixer at the Auberge recently and didn't eat much beyond the lovely appetizers that were passed around. But the bar and wait staff were friendly pros, very quick, always smiling. They remembered the beer I was drinking even in a crush of 200 people and took a second to have a laugh with everyone. The space is so essentially Old Montreal, a nearly 300 year old stone building with twisting wooden staircases, pianos, comfy chairs and epic modern art on a tiny ancient alley in this most romantic part of town."}
{"text":"I found this place because it was on a list of restaurants open New Year's Day.  We really enjoyed the ambience and food.  The decor is original and chic, and the bar and dining room are very comfortable. There is a large open fire in the dining room that is also used for some food prep, and there is an open rotisserie that was filled with Cornish hens. As it was the day after a major holiday, the menu may have been pared down but I couldn't say for sure. It was different than what was listed online. Regardless, we all found something. There was nothing our child would like on the regular menu and the bar menu wasn't available (it looked very good) but the server brought him a large portion of noodles with cheese that was appreciated. 
I had the Cornish hen and I liked it a lot. It's not something I would typically order but since it's a house specialty it seemed the better choice over scallops. My husband had the duck and it was very good. There is an assortment of fresh baked breads for the table that were delicious. I liked the sesame and the olive the best.
Our server didn't explain that the price of an entree includes a starter and dessert so we were a little confused at first when ordering. We didn't find it noisy at all and there were people seated all around us but no one was on the couches directly behind us which could possibly have made a difference. 
This is a great place for a special occasion or if you are visiting from out of town. We'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Loved the food, the ambience, the service. Going back to Montréal and this restaurant. Don't  miss dessert, great drinks, charcuterie platter, and more."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to bring a date for dinner, very good food, courteous staff and nice ambiance."}
{"text":"We were a group of 20 which is a good test for a restaurant. 
We made a reservation and were given our own somewhat condensed menu which was fine as it included all food types. 
I give credit to our waitress Pauline who wasted no time taking our orders, serving including a free but small appetizer, dessert and no problem receiving individual bills. 

But the food for the price was not good value. I had the barley rosotto which was good, lots of crunchy French bread and chateaubriand for $43 was overpriced for the quality. My wife could not eat her lemon crumble as just too much lemon. I agreed after tasting. 
All desserts included diary and I asked for a fruit serving which I received. A nice touch. 
They passed the group test but food needs improvement, considering the price."}
{"text":"Planned to try that place and enjoy some appetizers at the bar with wine before going for dinner close by. I wanted to kill 2 birds with one stone.
Well, I couldnt find anything on the menu or board that was interesting to eat as appetizers. Didnt have much choice. Finally got the mixed olives, it was good but nothing out of the ordinary. 
Service was ok. 
I definitely have to go back to try the full dinner menu."}
{"text":"We hosted our wedding (ceremony and reception) at the Auberge St.Gabriel last weekend and it couldn't have been more perfect. They are closed for regular service on Sunday and Monday but had no problem accommodating our party of about 85 people for a ceremony downstairs and the reception on their 3rd floor.
The food they served was amazing, the staff stood on their heads to make sure everyone was taken care of in every way. We brought a band that easily plugged in to the house system and sounded great. We had Groupe Carte Blanche do a bit of decorating for us (they are true professions as well) but the venue is so unique it doesn't take much.

Thank you all for making our wedding perfect. We will be back for lunch as soon as we can!"}
{"text":"If Buffy the Vampire Slayer made the underworld sexy then L'Auberge is a fast follow. Decorated in modern gothic decor, the restaurant is adorned with heavy wood pieces, bare brick/stone walls lined with candles and dressed in Hirst inspired pieces of art including a whale spine and two stuffed horses with necks sewn together. If the decor wasn't cool enough, the bar with it's large selection of scotches and brandies alongside dripping pillars of candle is something I could sit and stare at all day. 

Arriving late, we were unable to order much food besides fries, burgers and a cheese platter but from what we had, everything was delicious. I'm sure the amount I had to drink contributed to the overall vibe of this place but it is seriously a cool venue. Besides the restaurant and bar, we happened to hit L'Auberge on a night when their downstairs opens as an after hours type of bar. Since we were already in the restaurant, we weren't charged cover which was apparently $20 per person. In any case, knowing now that the downstairs looks even cooler than upstairs I would definitely have paid it. After descending a flight of stone stairs, you go through a dark stone tunnel to a nightclub of sorts. There is only one bar, but multiple areas to sit or dance in. Following suit with the decor upstairs, the downstairs was similarly adorned with heavy wooden and leather furniture, wrought iron grates in some areas and walls filled with pillars of candles. For the adventurous, there was even a stripper pole to take things up a notch (women only, no men allowed on the pole according to the bouncer)! The music like the rest of the venue was a more transcendental kind of electronic which totally suited the space but may change depending on the evening. 

Overall, I would revisit L'Auberge if not to repeat the great time then to see in a sober state of mind whether it was scotch goggles or a truly cool place. Regardless, before the drinks started pouring, the venue was still beautiful so I would rate it 5 stars based on pre-drink experience."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the outdoor seating and were allowed to tour the historic inn. They have decorated well without destroying or hiding the original structure. The staff is friendly speaking both French and English fluently. Our dessert arrived while we were walking around and the hostess tracked us down, so that it wouldn't get cold. 
The Cornish hen was delicious and filling with mashed potatoes and salad. The steak was properly prepared and scrumptious but really needed more of a side, perhaps a salad. 
The desserts were rhubarb soufflé which took fifteen minutes and was worth it. The chocolate salted caramel was moist with a hard crust. Delicious fare, fabulous location and good service with interesting history. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I took some out of town clients here for a nice dinner at the recommendation of their hotel concierge and I was delighted!  I live quite close by, so I don't know how I've missed it all these years.  

The decor and meal presentation was absolutely stunning.  
Additionally, our servers were just perfect and didn't interrupt key conversations.

As some others mentioned, it's pricey- but I felt the value was there.
I was particularly impressed by the mini-treats that came out in between courses as a complete surprise.  And lastly - the surprise take-home brownie that I forgot in my purse and found the next day.  To die for."}
{"text":"Went to a group event that was held on the first floor in the bar area.  The atmosphere is hip, relaxed but warm and inviting. I liked the exposed stone and steel on the walls commemorating the previous structure that stood there. Bar has a extensive selection of liquors so pretty much any drink is possible.  The passed tapas items were creative and top notch.  They ended the evening with delicious brownies!"}
{"text":"What an absolute delight!  We happened upon this lovely restaurant which is a bit off the main tourist drag in Old Montreal and can also be accessed they the Springhill Suites hotel. A fabulous place for an intimate dinner that is truly French in service and gastronomy. Our server, a lovely women, made us feel welcomed and that we could linger as we wished. If you are looming for giant American sized portions don't come here, but if you are looking for a wonderful dining experience in a great outdoor, as well as indoor, setting go and go now."}
{"text":"We were ready for lunch and wandering blindly past what felt like hundreds of restaurants in the Old Port on a hot August day when we found this place. There was lovely al fresco seating, but no place large enough for our group of six, so we went indoors. What a cool spot. Interesting art on the walls (and if you head into the bar, there's some really funky art!), comfortable and elegant seating. We ordered from the 3-course prix fixe lunch menu (from 19$-28$ cdn), and were presented with lovely -- and delicious offerings. In our group, we started with a martini glass filled with Shrimp from Gaspasia with a corn and tomato coulis that tasted like summer, a delicious fennel gazpacho, and a tuna tatake to die for. Entrees included taglitelle with summer veg and bison meatballs, fried liver with a frisee salad and salmon tartare. Desserts were appropriately small and extremely lovely. Their by the glass wine list included a couple of tasty Quebec wines. This place is a gem. Check it out!"}
{"text":"We had the best waiter: Ian   There was a few of us and we ate outside. What a beautiful place.  The charcuterie was such a nice food adventure with new options to taste it kind of killed my appetite. Kind of - I still polished off my Chateau Briand with the most interesting potato kisses and green beans with almonds.  Amazing atmosphere old meets new art.  Loved it"}
{"text":"This is truly a must dine locale.  The ambiance is simply stunning.  The ancient timbers that support the roof and the stonework on the walls are a stark contrast to the suspended metal fireplaces and glass wine room.  There are some interesting art pieces as well such as a giant whale spine at the entrance and two large moose that are joined at the neck which adds a very eclectic spin to the traditional, yet stunning, architecture.   

As for the food?  The Châteaubriand was, without question, the best steak I've ever had.  The fillet was fork tender, perfectly seasoned and sliced right at the table.  They dry age each steak on the premises and they can be seen in a glass storage room at the entrance.  A friend of mine had the rabbit paella which was both a visual treat and extremely tasty.  

The wait staff was friendly, prompt, responsive, and spoke fluent English.

For those interested in wine, the list is extensive (although very French dominant) and the prices are varied.  The restaurant has TWO trained sommeliers on staff and the one that assisted our party was extremely knowledgeable.  She was very patient with our questions and pared three excellent wines for our dinner (no easy task because the meals varied from light fish to heavy meats and everything in between.)  

The underground club was not for us.  Cramped, hot, low ceilings and extremely minimal lighting made for an unpleasant club experience but I would not deduct any stars from the restaurant food/ambiance/service."}
{"text":"So I did not come here for dinner, as I ate at the place next door, but we actually came here to go out after dinner.

The place is simply amazing, hands down one of the best night clubs I have ever been to, mind you it was Formula 1 weekend, and we got lucky to get a table in what I call the dungeon room, but it really was an old fashioned style stone room in the basement.  Place was popping and a bit pricey but when your ordering bottles, you can't really complain."}
{"text":"Walked in with out reservations on a Saturday. Asked to sit outside and were accommodated. Did not have mussels for the the Bouillabaisse  so they substituted lobster- outstanding . It comes with a saffron butter and with bread- my wife scarfed it so the brought me more (thank you very much) Wife had Halibut which she said was cooked to perfection. 

Waite staff were incredibly friendly. Didn't rush us and offered suggestions of sites to see after dinner. Atmosphere - an oasis from the tourism of St Paul street.  Quiet and charming though the stuffed moose lamp outside the rest rooms I still am confused by

This place was a gem to find as we walked down a cobble stone off the beaten path road"}
{"text":"Amazing wines. I mean, amazing!! The charcuteries are Chef Gonzales' specialty, so make sure you try them! The portions a quite big so you could definitely share apps and still be fine. Love the set-up, great service, great food. Would be great for a large party, too."}
{"text":"This is a review from my visit several years ago, but I wanted to enter one to make sure I remember this place!
I remember unique and beautifully presented food -- including vegetarian options -- along with great service. The staff were very kind to my father, who is a difficult-to-manage senior citizen. The surroundings were beautiful, and I remember some very unusual taxidermy! Would go back if in Montreal again."}
{"text":"Such a classy venue! If you're hosting some kind of corporate get together, meet and greet... heck, even a personal party, this is the place to be. The ambience is magical, the staff are outstanding, and the venue itself is absolutely gorgeous. 

Not sure if they cater the events themselves, but if they do, compliments to the chef. I haven't been that satisfied after a corporate event in ages - the fact that the staff kept surprising us with more and more canapés didn't hurt either. 

They were also really cool about letting us overstay our welcome. Even after they had started taking down the setup, the staff were super gracious about us lingering and drinking some more. Which reminds me: don't forget to tip the bartender. That guy was boss! 

So if you're looking for a venue for your next event, you know who to call."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten at the restaurant here, but as a venue space it is absolutely incredible.  As the pictures show you there's a giant whale tailbone that greets you when you enter.  To the left is a classy dining area, and to the right is the main hall for events; along with a staircase heading down, and two mooses joined at the neck by a lightbulb. If you dare go down the stone stairs (that looks like something out of a castle), you'll be enclosed in a long narrow corridor where the walls and floor are uneven stone pieces.  Eventually you arrive at another venue space with a bar that was (definitely) a dungeon in a past life."}
{"text":"A small intimate restaurant in Old Montreal with excellent food! This bistro also has a private room whereby you can host a private function! I was here for a private event with our sales team & enjoyed the quick service, attention to detail & the extra add ons. Good wine list as well! Definitely a great place for business or pleasure!"}
{"text":"Not at all worth it. Lobster Mac was very bland, the lobster was the only edible part. The Cornish game hen was also bland. Both portions were too small to be filling. I'd say that food was worth $12 per plate, not $25-30."}
{"text":"After dinner, I wanted to take my sister out to continue the night with some music and drinks. We went to the bar of the auberge saint gabriel while waiting for the club to open its doors. I ordered two drinks but shortly after ( i had maybe two sips and my sister's glass was full), i spilled my drinks on my clothes and it made a mess. The barmaid saw me and was literally watching for a minute before handing me a napkin. I reached behind the bar to grab some more because i was wet and the chair also. After watching me clean myself she approached and asked me if i wanted another drink. I said yes of course give me the same. She served me and quickly took the bill , made a new one and put it in front of me. I said excuse me I thought you were offering the drink to me... she said dont you know how it works? When you order a drink you have to pay for it.... I was insulted. As if she was telling me i was cheap or that i dropped my drink on purpose .i barely took a sip paid and left for another bar. There is no way i will pay money in a place where i feel disrespected. This barmaid needs a lesson in customer service."}
{"text":"The first night at our hotel, we peered through beaded glittery curtains at one end of the lobby to a dimmed, mysterious interior. After checking out the dinner prices, we decided our three-hour drive through the rain had taken away our desire for a fine dining experience, so we ventured out into the pouring rain in search of a more ordinary dinner.

The second night, however, the door was closed, the menu gone, and our curiosity just got the better of us. So at about 11 PM, we ventured through the portal into what turned out to be the coatroom, and an easy way around the $10 cover charge they were asking at the door! Score.

Once we were settled with drinks, I said to my husband, \"I think this place is too cool for us.\" I'm not sure whether it was the huge, uplit dinosaur backbone, or the animal-hoof coat hooks on the wall, or the group of guys on rolling stools that kept buying the bartender shots, but I felt much older and less hip than I normally do. It was fun to see the beautiful people arrive in grandeur and depart with a little more affection, though.

Cocktails were fine, prepared to order and priced normally for a large city. On our way out we perused the cured meats on display and peeked into the stylishly rustic dining room. Someday I'd like to return for the food everyone's raving about here!"}
{"text":"C'est beaaaauuuuuuuu......

J'avoue que je donne la majorité des étoiles à cause du décor de l'Auberge. En entrant, on se sent rapidement transporté dans un endroit féérique, surtout à ce temps-ci de l'année. La géante colonne vertébrale au coeur de l'Auberge est très impressionnante. C'est un endroit super chaleureux avec un éclairage doux et coloré qui donne l'impression que tout est allumé avec des chandelles.

Je suis allée à l'Auberge pour un événement spécial, donc je n'ai pas eu la chance de goûter à toute leur nourriture ou bien voir leur menu complet. Toutefois, les bouchées qui nous ont été servies étaient très bien donc j'imagine qu'un repas complet risque d'être délicieux aussi. J'attends d'en faire l'expérience avant de rajouter une autre étoile..."}
{"text":"The oldest building in Montreal (1688) provided an exceptional experience. 
Interesting building with an eclectic decor. It is an old stone walled building, pretty well maintained but be forewarned it's got character along with some \"different\" furnishings. After a long day walking the Old Port I loved the \"1688\" the house twist on a Gin and Tonic to start the night.
The meal: The large charcuterie plate was more than 4 of us needed, all of the 3 foie gras (rabbit, pork and chicken liver) were excellent, the other meats were just as good. 
My wife had the duck and rated it the best duck dish she has ever had. The spit cooked hen was moist and very flavorful, great (really great) mashed potatoes with a small salad accompanied it.  The scallops got a great review as well. I think the wine list is actually too long. It's difficult to narrow down the multi country multi appellation list to what will pair well with everyone's meal. That said, the server was excellent in helping us find a Pouilly-Fumé that went well with everything we had. We were forced to spit a Creamy praline, gianduja, because we were so full from devouring dinner. I;m not even sure what it was but it was a great finish to the great meal.
The service all evening was professional, friendly and an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Their Terrace is beautiful one of the best looking terraces i have ever been... 
i ordered the roasted cauliflower  which was slightly under cooked ... 
I would totally go back .... not essentially for the food which without being disappointed cause i really was not..... it did not wowed me either 
But i would definitely go back for their terrace and the vibe .!!!"}
