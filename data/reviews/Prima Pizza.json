{"text":"First time back since the new owner, service was impeccable. Restaurant itself was very clean and orderly!  The workers and owner were so awesome and friendly!  The lunch deals are spectacular. We got the pizza and wings special with a side order of garlic knots and man alive was the food incredible.  The owner makes the sauce himself and the sauce is acidic free. So all in all we definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"OK Something is wrong with this picture. I am seeing 1 stars then 5 stars back to 1 stars. I think Yelp needs to realize that this biz has changed hands a few times. Maybe give these folks a chance and just go by the dates that these owners took over the place. I went here on a whim. I remember my son saying that he thought is was close to a little mom and pop spot that we both used to work at. Our previous employer had great pizza and incredible Italian. This isn't about them though. Let me tell you what I do know. 

Very friendly people when you walk in. I met Bud the owner and his Head Chef. Damn nice people. We talked shop a little and he even asked me if my son was looking for work. I ordered a slice of cheese while standing at the counter. I was impressed by the slice pies and the size of the slices. I am a Boston girl and I know my pie. NY style pizza is a little greasy, the cheese stretches from your mouth when you take a bite. It is messy people. That is what makes it so damn good. This place is definitely doing something right. There is only one other time I have had pizza that good and that was at the previous job. I stopped eating pizza out here cuz I couldn't find the real deal. Well here it is. Cassanova Brothers holds nothing over this place. It;s all frozen there. I tried it twice. I didn't review it because I don't do the whole negative review thing. This place is a gem. I will recommend them to anyone I come across looking for pizza. I highly recommend it. Stop in for a slice and a conversation. I will definitely be back. I am looking forward to sampling the calzone and the eggplant. 

When reading the reviews pay attention to the dates because I guarantee the current owners have received more positive than negative reviews."}
{"text":"White eggplant pizza. Not on the menu but they excel at it. Ask nicely and you might get one. Probably the best I have had."}
{"text":"Great calzones and grinders, and Ashley is the most beautiful gal in the east valley.  First time here and we'll be regulars.  Dine in or order out."}
{"text":"My review is based on customer service only as I wasn't able to even order food. Walked in, was barely acknowledged by the woman behind the counter. As she finally came to take my order I  began and then stopped to ask if she could break a $50 as I had just lost my debit card. She said no, hit some buttons on her machine and just turned around to go back to what she was doing. She was so rude I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"I used to love this pizza place one of my favorites under the old owners the new owners are driving this place into the ground the pizza is terrible I've been there three times and all three times I was very disappointed. That's a shame this place went from one of the best pizzas two now the worst When you stop into a pizza place at 12 noon and it's empty that's not a good sign"}
{"text":"Just ate lunch here.  The service was so so.  The pizza was decent but not anything phenomenal. I ordered the garlic knots which came out slightly cool and dripping with grease.   I was hoping to find a nice little local pizza place but left thoroughly underwhelmed.   I won't be coming back.

Edit: just received a \"compliment\" on my review from someone who I suspect is either  an owner or a friend of the owner.  They accosted me for not discussing my issues with the owners, and then went on to state \"I wish you luck with your life, it appears you need it\". I'm sorry but this is flat out bad business.   If they had noted my issues and asked me to give it another try I would have, and this edit would potentially be much different.   I would encourage the ownership to look up a few recent incidents where business handled poor reviews badly, it can and will take you down.  Listen to your customers, they hold all the $$$. 

Good luck to you as well, I suspect you will need it too."}
{"text":"Very good family pizza spot!  Pizza is great.  The thin crust is very tasty.  Chicken wings are amazing and I am not really even a big wing lover.  Very friendly customer service."}
{"text":"Either people in Gilbert don't know shit about pizza, or these reviews are fake. The pizza was made with cheap ingredients. The sausage was something you would find on a $2 frozen pizza. Nothing about the pizza was impressive. I would rather eat papa johns. There was no friendly guy working there, just a grumpy Romanian guy with a unibrow on his cell phone. It was dark and hot in the restaurant - we were all sweating.  Avoid this place for sure."}
{"text":"We did return and the pizza was even greasier than the first time. It took 3 paper towels to blot up all the grease. It was just too much. We will not be going back again."}
{"text":"I'm am really not liking the new people. They are rude and don't care about their customers.  I was 1.00 short for pizza delivery and they snubbed me. They would rather lose 1.00 over 22.00. It's ridiculous. And then tried to explain why they can't lose a dollar. I literally live right behind them. I've been a dollar short at thai chili  which is not a franchise they don't even ask. I'm not buying a whole pizza to compensate for a dollar. I've never had worse service. I thought I'd give it one more try since the last time I tried it new owners new taste. Not a good one. But now I don't want anything to do with these jerks."}
{"text":"I guess my pizza was better than Domino's or Pizza Hut, but I wouldn't likely eat here again, which is unfortunate because it's so close to my office.

My pizza was made with cheap ingredients and tasted like it. The breading wasn't anything to write home about either.

Not sure where all the 4- and 5-star reviews are coming from... Clearly they're either faked, customers don't know the difference between crap pizza and quality pizza, or they've downgraded their ingredients since then (2 weeks ago in reference to Joey B's 5-star review!). Poor Joey wouldn't know good pizza if it gave him a reach around!

If you want amazing New York-style pizza in Mesa, go to Venezia's (venezias.com) and if you want the best New York-style pizza in Arizona, go to Joe's (eatatjoesny.com) in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever -- they kept the same recipe from the Estonian brothers!!! My husband has been coming here since high school and when he took me here, I couldn't believe it. Hands down -- best pizza ever. If I could give this place 6 stars, I would. No other place does pizza better!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and to watch Sunday football. New owner has several new TV'S. Interior has been updated and looks great. This restaurant is a great find. Food is great, too."}
{"text":"It's okay Pizza thought I'd stop in cause I always pass this place on my way home the lunch special is what drew me in. 

The place had the right style of pizza for NY but was missing something for me. Maybe it was lacking flavor?"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!   

Very friendly staff.   Very informative  on what was available. Allowed this picky eater to order according to taste and it came out correctly!!!! 

I ordered the pasta.   It was delicious.   Noodles cooked just right and hot.   The sauce was so delicate and light tasting.   Not overpowering of one ingredient over another.   The pizza is New York style and paper thin.....just the way it's suppose to be. Very foldable.   I'm so jealous  that I didn't  order that!!! (Next time!!!) 

Will definitely  come again.   Best $5.00 lunch special!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently tried this place since we live close and were pleasantly surprised.  The pizza was very good.  A little light on the sauce, but we ordered extra the second time and it was much better.  They make their own ranch dressing which is really good, and he wings were delicious.  Again, I would prefer more sauce, but they will pretty much give you whatever you ask for.  Even if it's not on the menu.  The new owners are very nice, the service is nice.  The only negative is that the restaurant is a little warm, but they do what they can to make it not so noticeable.  The place is much larger than it appears from the outside.  Good for large family gatherings, team dinners, etc.  Nice place.  I'm sad to see the 1 star ratings because the food is very good.  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Well I have to say.....EXTREMELY impressed!  Stopped by here tonight for dinner with the wife and was greeted with open arms by the new owner.  Made us feel right at home discussing items on the menu with us and giving us suggestions.  Sometimes you never know how the quality may get with a new owner, but I can tell you that the food is phenomenal!  I had the Calzone Special (basically a calzone filled with all sorts of yummy deliciousness) and my wife had the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich (which of course I had to sample as well).  The only thing I think this place could use are cots in the back....  you get some much damn food, you wanna take a nap when your done!!  MY KIND OF PLACE!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a to-go order from this place and they were amazing. Were at my house within an hour, the pizza was so delicious I've been wanting to order from them ever since. The garlic knots were very oily, which isn't my cup of tea, but my husband really enjoyed them. We also ordered pasta which was perfectly saucy and delicious.

I realize that I've also eaten here several months ago when the new owners took over. We were skeptical because we really loved the previous owners and the way they cooked their food, but we were completely happy with the new owners as well! I ordered wings which were exactly what I was looking for taste wise, they were perfect and my husband kept stealing them off my plate. My son got a slice of pizza and my husband ordered pasta, both of which were delicious (according to them). 

The only issue I had several months ago was that the soda tasted 'plastic-y' but since my delivery order last week I can tell you that the soda tastes fine now. 

The new owners here were very inviting and friendly and I would 100% recommend this pizza place to anyone who was looking for a friendly atmosphere and good pizza. 
The remodel they did looks great and is bright and inviting with huge tvs. 

I understand why there is a minimum dollar amount for order, and if they allowed every person to be a few dollars short, what would be the point of having a minimum dollar amount? Order an extra drink and enjoy!! They're worth it!"}
{"text":"This is how pizza should taste and be cooked, in a pizza oven! I have tried the so called great pizza from Oreganos, Gilbert pizza, Bucis, and all of the other places and this kills them. Let me educate Arizona on pizza, it's supposed to have a crust on the bottom. It's supposed to drip oil. That's the quality of the ingredients.  There salads are nice, there antipasto is excellent, and the heros are great. If you have a problem with the owners eyebrows or you want someone to kiss your butt with service then go some where else. If you want excellent Italian takeout then Prima is for you."}
{"text":"Try the white pizza. You won't regret it. People writing reviews about it being too greasy are clueless. News flash folks, NY pizza isn't authentic without the thin crust and a little grease. Nice option for a local joint with no frills."}
{"text":"This place charges you .40 a topping for a slice of pizza. I ordered a slice of pizza with peo, sausage and olives and it was almost $4 for 1 slice of pizza. How is that a deal?"}
{"text":"We went here yesterday for take out on the way to visit the kids and grandkids! What a disappointment. LONG wait, the food was HORRIBLE. I asked before the food was ready if they provide sauce for the garlic knots and ranch for the wings and Brenda (the owner?) said \"Yes, we provide marinara for the knots and ranch for the wings.\" When the food was ready to go, I asked if the sauces were in there, they looked at me all bothered (maybe since I had already asked about the sauces) and rudely said \"yes, there is ranch and marinara.\"  Well, I SHOULD HAVE CHECKED my dang self!  Once we sat down to eat, guess what? No ranch - WTH!  And a TEEENEY WEEENY container of marinara, not enough for one garlic knot. What a joke! First of all the pizza was horrible, I've had frozen pizza 10 times better than this. The wings were dried up and smaller than I'd ever think possible for a chicken wing. OMG - What a waste of $38.00. What people see in this place, I have no idea. Was it just my bad luck to get horrible food? Will it be better next time? I don't know, and I don't care. I don't plan on EVER going back. On top of all that, I didn't even get a receipt! I thought they stapled it to the bag, or put it inside the bag, but...NOPE! Nada - nothing! I give them a negative 5, but it made me check at least 1 start just to post this."}
{"text":"Great pizza and calzones, I'd you try this place you've gotta try the garlic knots...they're great."}
{"text":"Originally posted 4/11/2009. Edit - 1/17/2012: I originally gave this place four stars. I'm not sure why.  This place is closer to a 2.5 star, but since we don't get half-star rating on Yelp, two it is). It's not terrible, but it's definitely not exceptional. Service has never been particularly warm and friendly. Bottom line: it'll do if you're in a rush and just want a slice."}
{"text":"Really good New York style pizza with out the hype.
 Crispy  crust with a decent amount of grease on top... Yummm :-) I had mine with anchovies and my husband ordered his with sausage...We we're both very happy!   Skip Casanova 's ... (   Bland pizza... Doughy crust plus you wait  FOREVER to get your order)  prima's was cheaper, better, faster....!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and such a family feel. I love that when I stop in, they remember me and my family. This is as close to New York pizza I have found in Gilbert!  Everything I've had on the menu is delicious from the salads, to fried zucchini, to the pizza!"}
{"text":"If you like Dominos, Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, New York Pizza Dept or any of the 1000 different pizza places in Arizona then don't bother stopping at Prima Pizza. Prima Pizza is the real deal! Hands down I have not had better pizza anywhere in Arizona. You will not get fancy seats or sexy waitresses in fact some of you might find the owners to come across a bit grumpy. Don't let it fool you this is home made pizza from some great guys that know how to cook. I highly recommend the pepperoni pizza well done and the steak special sandwich. Let them cook it and make it how it was intended to be made and I would be shocked if you did not fall in love with it. Visit 2, 3 or maybe 5 times and eventually the owners will start to give you the attention you have to earn. Sometimes I go twice a week and I never get tired of it. If you are from back east this is a place that will remind you of home. Just go and try the dang pizza. My entire family loves it and about everyone at work goes there regularly even though it is out of the way."}
{"text":"I really did want to get 5 stars as I do really like this place for the fact that it is locally owned family owned the service is always friendly and the food is always good I don't know that I would say the food is 5 Star but it is definitely good in the Price Is Right you're looking for a quick Italian bite to eat in the Gilbert area and you don't feel like fighting all the soccer moms at all the whitewashed usual suspect restaurants this is a nice little hole-in-the-wall that I suggest you visit"}
{"text":"Great place to have a couple of slices of Pizza. We come from Illinois where there are so many great places to have Italian food.  So far this place has been the best we have tried in Mesa.  Crust was nice and crisp.  Nice little place kind of hidden but well worth finding.

Hope this place stays around for a very long time."}
{"text":"Ok, my family and I love the food. The pizza is ok but the wings are really good, and the ranch dressing that comes with them is phenominal. We have been getting wings from them often within the last 6 months. When I say often I mean every other week sometimes every week. So yes, we do buy from them. My complaint is the staff. They are so incredibly rude. I spend alot of money there to not even be acknowledged when I walk in is somewhat rude and unprofessional. The young lady that is at the register lacks customer service skills. EVERY time that I go in and pick up my order I hate giving them my money becasue of the bad service. And I am just picking up my order so I cant imagine what its like to dine there. If it wasnt for the wings being very good I would not give this pizza place my money. The owners should go over to Casanova brothers and see how they treat their customers and take notes on how customer service is done."}
{"text":"Great sevice! Fantastic cheesecake !
Great pizza!! Would come back! Thanks Prima Pizza!!"}
{"text":"41$ poorly spent. Ordered an 18\" mushroom pepperoni. $2.25 a topping would be fine if it didn't end up tasting like Peter Piper. Mushrooms are CANNED. I also got the hot wings. 
Definitely not worth $1 per wing; overcooked. 
Quite disappointed."}
{"text":"New owners, 'old recipe' (per the new owner), NOT the same. I will give this another go, but today I was thoroughly unimpressed. Guess I'll make the drive on down to Casanova Brothers again.

--thoughts after initial update to review--

Here is the thing. The place was a dirty, hole in the wall, REAL New York pizza joint with a just shy of rude owner (which is what you expect for the place). Walk in, \"whaddayawant\", throw some gigantic slices of cheese pizza in the oven and continue the phone conversation in some other language. Now it is cleaned up, big A frame sign with smilie face drawings that reads \"Prima Pizza Bistro\", and pizza made with cheap ingredients. People did not come here for a \"bistro\", we came here for some grease to your elbow NY pizza.  I have eaten here since the place opened, I will not be back. 

For Yelpers looking for a good NY pizza joint, I no longer recommend this place.  Cruise on past and go to Casanova Brothers. They are better than Prima was before, far better than now. I am really sad to see this place change hands and change the quality. You should not change what is not broken."}
{"text":"We were in here last night for the first time. Got their large pizza and wings special. I noticed some people next to us got the lasagna and it looks very good as well.The food was fantastic and the service was great. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The pizza was thin, had a good taste but very greasy. We had the garlic knots and they were super greasy and weren't as great as I was hoping. The drinks had a weird taste to them as well. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the staff were really nice and genuine. It might be a good place if you had a nice buzz."}
{"text":"Based off of other reviews, I guess it depends on when you go what kind of service you'll get. I've never had their pizza, it never looks appetizing when you walk in and see it sitting on the counter. I was craving garlic bread and this place had good reviews on their garlic knots so I got some. They are incredible! Well, the first time I had them, they were. The second time, when I would bite into one, grease went EVERY where. Like it was a grease bomb. Still good but that much greasy oily-ness was a deterrent. So, that was a couple months ago and I was in the mood for spaghetti recently. The young woman at the front counter seemed nice enough but she definitely was being obviously fake and could care less what you had to say, just place your order if you must and get out of her face. I wouldn't hold it against her, we all have bad days when we try hard to be nice but it doesn't always come across well. When I asked for spaghetti with meatballs, I was given the option of three different pastas, which was awesome but I went with regular and meat sauce instead of meatballs. Apparently I was ordering the dinner special or something because it came with a salad and garlic knots (which I was going to order anyway because hopefully they'd be good this time). I requested a caesar salad because that's the safest bet that people don't go crazy like they would a house salad. When I went to find a seat while I waited, the first table was still dirty from whatever patron had eaten there so I moved on. The next table seemed relatively clean but come to find out after I sat that the top was completely sticky like they had used a dirty rag in dirty water to wipe the table off. Time went by and eventually my food was ready. I opened the bag to check for utensils and napkins since I usually forget to look and don't want to ask if they already provided it. I didn't see any and, when I looked up to ask, the man I assume is the manager was giving me a look that made me so nervous I asked for parmesan packets instead of utensils. The look from the young woman was more of a \"why are you still wasting my time, just leave\" so i asked for one and left as fast as possible. When I arrived home, I pulled out a small Styrofoam container and a larger aluminum container. I thought they had forgotten my garlic knots and I was sad because that was the part I was looking forward to the most. Unfortunately, they had stuck them in with the spaghetti. Most people wouldn't find this a problem unless they don't like soggy bread. I don't like soggy bread and I also do not like sauce on garlic bread in any state. It's not their fault, I didn't know and I'm sure they're just trying to save money on containers. So I moved on to the salad.... I've never had a caesar salad that had black olives in it and it was littered with them. It's a pizza place. They should have enough toppings to make an accurate caesar salad. I ended up tossing it out. I then moved onto the garlic knots, even though covered in sauce, maybe they could save the meal. I was so wrong. Both knots I had received were completely burnt on the bottom and that was all they tasted like, even with the added sauce on them. Ok, well, maybe the spaghetti can save this meal since that was what I was initially in the mood for anyway. I've had more flavorful spaghetti from a freezer section. The noodles were the only good part of the entire meal.

Will I go back? Only one more time for those garlic knots. If they're bad again, I will never return and take my business down the road to Casanova Bros where they seem legitimately nice, even when they're busy, and treat you like an old friend of the family."}
{"text":"I love this ghetto pizza palace.

They don't have menus (that I could see). It's on that kind of black marquee board with the white letters (you know, snack bar style).

The pizza was cheap, fast and the crust was crispy without being burnt, and the pepperoni and cheese melted wonderfully without being too salty.

I am SOOOOO glad I won over my friend's bid for Domino's.  ick.

Plus it's right by my office.  Yay!"}
{"text":"I love prima pizza. I wish more people knew about it. Pizza slices are big. The wings are awesome! Great price. I recommend prima pizza to any pizza lover."}
{"text":"The $3.50 lunch special sounded like such a great deal.  Lesson learned, you get what you pay for (or maybe less).

Pizza had been sitting too long and was burnt.  You should be able to fold a slice but these were so hard the crust was cardboard.

I had to leave my meal early when a worker started smoking right outside the door and stunk up the place.  

Thanks for the economics lesson Prima.  I give you 2 stars because at least you didn't make me ill."}
{"text":"Decent local pizza shop in a strip mall. The cannoli is made fresh to order, which is a plus."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their pizza. I am from NY and crave thin crust with \"spicy\" tomato sauce. Most of the places in the valley don't appeal to me, but this little strip mall pizza joint is the closest I've found to East Coast pie."}
{"text":"I really like this pizza. There are days when it is hit or miss and I agree that is not a good thing, but on the hit days and for me, even on the miss days, I love this pizza! I told my boyfriend that if I moved away, I would probably crave this place. Instead of trying the $3 lunch special to judge this place, try ordering a pizza for take out. That way you try the delicious ooey-gooey pizza fresh and delicious in all of its splendor! To add, they have probably the best ranch sauce ever so be sure to get some to dip your pizza in, it adds to the awesome-ness. Also - great for hang overs... just sayin'! :)"}
{"text":"I feel like I lost a good friend....What happened??? Prima Pizza has been my \"go to\" local pizza place for many years. Much to my surprise I walked in to see different faces and a state of confusion by the new folks. I had ordered a pepperoni pizza, I saw it come out of the oven and the new cook sees that it does not have any pepperoni on it and proceeds to put it in the box, slices it, and then lays the cold pepperoni on it! I called him on it and asked him to cook it longer. He did. Ugh..... I was already upset at the fact that this was not the place I had grown to love. The crust was tough and thicker than before, and I won't even talk about toppings! Not Prima Pizza at all. Maybe they'll work out the kinks, I sure hope so...and I will try again."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to eat. The lunch special was excellent, the pizza was great, our favorite! Now, with the \"new\" owners, the pizza doesn't taste the same, the lunch special is almost $2 more expensive for the same thing and the whole vibe of the place is gone. 

I understand that businesses change hands but why mess with what was working? Everyone I knew in 2012 LOVED this place. Now, everyone I know who used to eat here weekly won't touch the place. 

People who still say this place is \"great\" obviously never tasted what it was back in it's day. This actually makes me very sad that I have to write this review, because my memories of taking my kids to Prima Pizza a few years back and splitting a lunch special with them are now just that - memories. I am leaving two stars only because this place used to deserve 10 stars."}
{"text":"Meh, it was ok. Customer service lacked. Went to place my order and I got to the pizza and he quickly said 15 min, and then walked and came back and I ordered the fried mushrooms which were ok. Overall, the price was decent, $18.50 for a large and an appetizer. It's close to my house, but don't know if I'd go back. Maybe on a lunch break.."}
{"text":"Went here because my son said it was AWESOME. Well he was right for once in his life:) New owners are happy to be there and treated every customer like a true customer. The pizza was very good! I am a pizza snob and believe most pizza out west is revolting. This is good pizza! Crust was perfect and the sausage was even better. Did I mention the beer was super cold and comes in frosted mugs? Pardon a little bit of remodel dust. Many reviews mention that this place is a hole in the wall. It looks like the new owners are going to change that. I look forward to going back and watch them grow. Plenty of other things on menu I need to try."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best place ever! We were thrilled first grub hub order and the owner delivered himself. Quality is great and the customer service is phenomenal! These guys are awesome."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome!

Great service! Great Food! Great people!

Pizza was tasty. Wings flavored just right! 
Cheesecake and Canoli's were splendid!

Great environment , most importantly friendly staff!

We must all remember to support the mom and pop stores and step away from the subpar food and service at the big chain stores

The quality of the ingredients aren't even close to that of the big chains. They mass produce and prepare their food. The smaller places have to purchase in smaller quantities and use fresh daily prepared ingredients. Big difference

We were pleased . Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"we love this place!! amazing tasting pizza, even with just cheese-which I normally don't like elsewhere. not sure what to pinpoint for what makes it good, but the cheese I think, the light sauce and thinner crust all just make it amazing. And, if you get to talking to the employees, you will see they are nice and down-to-earth people. it's a simple, low-key place; which i like for those kind of nights. love how it's thinner crust, but not crispy; it's perfect NY style foldable pizza. if I could suggest anything, it would be to use fresh veggies, not canned and maybe have more specials or coupons, as the prices are a bit high-even for great pizza. wings are pretty good as well. It's my families favorite and a treat!"}
{"text":"Just went and got the wings and pizza to go! Not sure what these reviews about the sewer smell was? It was fine in there. The wings were excellent and the pizza was perfect! And a little grease isn't a bad thing people....owners were super friendly and I'll be brining my family and friends next time. O ya and they have $2.25 drafts all day! Sweet!!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for about 6 years now, and I have never been let down! The pizza in my opinion, is the best I have found in AZ. The crust is the perfect thinness, the cheese is so savory, and their wings are just delicious. Their wing sauce is the best! This is my favorite neighborhood pizza place that is always consistently great! Great job Prima Pizza!"}
{"text":"The service here is awesome. The owner makes you feel welcome and appreciated. Pizza is made fresh. It is good pizza and the service makes it great. The wings are awesome."}
{"text":"I was invited to try this place by a friend. Clearly they are from NY, but not the city of NY. The Buffalo Bills theme is very prominent here.I got the lunch special whish is 2 slices of one topping pizza and a large soda for $4.99. The slices are large NY style. I chose pepperoni for the topping. The crust is thin as NY style should be. It was baked to a golden brown and crispy on the crust edge. I was able to fold it over as you do with NY style. There was an adequate amount of cheese. There was something lacking that I couldn't quite put my finger on. Perhaps it was too little sauce. I still think it's a good pizza, but the lunch special rocks it. I'll be interested in trying the wings. Being as they are from Buffalo they should be pretty good."}
