{"text":"A bit lacking, as far as an Irishman is concerned. You better have some conversation perpared before hitting an unwashed table at patty's. Might as well drive another 10 minutes and attend the Kilkenny Irish bar instead. The waitresses are on and off... The food itself isn't special either. It's allright for a neighborhood pub, just dont waste time travelling across town, it's not worth the luck of the Irish. ;-)"}

{"text":"I think, no matter how they \"renovate\" or re-brand, or try to make this place 1/2 way decent , it will ALWAYS be a neighbourhood sh___t hole for the lower end cutomers of this area of town who cant drive because they got too many DUIs. 

Literally a third of the usable floor space in this semi-dive is just a collection of random broken or unused tables, chairs, old equipment etc. YES , no matter the day of the week you will encounter the \"regulars\" who can range from happy drunks to belligerent opinionated pricks.  

Be advised that some of the piece of sh__t regulars are buddies (or they THINK they are hhahahah!) with the waitresses / bar tenders. Yup, the dink who is confrontational to you outside having a smoke can often be seen being pals chatting etc with the sometimes pregnant waitress (who continues to dress provocatively etc LOL, CLAAAAAASSY!!).  One of the 2 guys pissers has had an out of order sign on it  for over a year, but people use it anyway so theres piss and toilet all over the floor in that one hah hah hah!

All that said, you CAN enjoy a $3.75 pint of their \"house\" draft that actually aint bad kinda like canadian or kokanee. And the bar tenders are never rude or slow either so thats all good. YES, the waitress service is sometimes slow (or non-existent hahah) BUT you cant get mad if the manager under staffs in an attempt to save money because theyre sinking :) 

IT is what it is: a semi-dive local bar with joke regulars and mediocre to bad \"ambience\" LOL. HEY everything bad i said and I still go there for a pint when Im in the area.
