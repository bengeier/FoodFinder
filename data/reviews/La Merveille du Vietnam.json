{"text":"I can concur with Adam Z. Putrid diarrhea post consumption. Food is meh. Won't be ordering again"}
{"text":"I often order a dinner for two once per week because it comes with enough food for 3 days and it saves me the hassle of having to cook on a work night. The last 3 times I have ordered I have needed to call them back after my order was delivered because my bag was missing something that I ordered. Not only that but the quality of the food changes from day to day. The last toe times I have had serious diarrhea afterwards and can officially confirm that it is their food :( I will no longer be ordering their cheap food :("}
{"text":"FINALEMENT! J'ai trouvé mon resto favori de bouffe asiatique pour commander.    Des fois, j'aime ça manger de la bouffe chinoise/mandarine, tu sais, des bons egg-rolls, du chow mein, du poulet aux ananas, des spare-ribs (ouf, l'OQLF va m'haïr en lisant ce texte).   Mais c'est rare de trouver un endroit qui sert de la nourriture de qualité. Il y a King Wah sur St-Denis qui est \"pas pire\", mais la Merveille du Vietnam est 2 étoiles au dessus de King Wah.   Tous les aliments étaient d'EXCELLENTE qualité. Le chow mein, que je n'aime pas plus que cela, était SUCCULENT. Le poulet était frais et délicieux. Les légumes étaient croquants. Les spare-ribs, qui sont souvent trop cuit et très dur à mangé, ce n'est pas le cas ici, ils sont tendres et super à manger. Même le riz était parfaitement cuit.   Leur rouleau impérial est vraiment DÉBILE!   En résumé c'est comme de la bouffe chinoise \"vietnamienisée\".  Ce n'est pas leur seule spécialité, ils servent surtout de la bouffe vietnamienne, un peu de Thai, et un peu de mandarin. J'ai bien hâte de goûter à d'autres plats.   En voyant des photos sur Internet, leur restaurant n'a pas l'air dépriment."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from this place last night. My boyfriend got bad food poisoning from his chicken dish (vomiting). I thankfully didn't get sick because my dish didn't contain meat. They also made a mistake in our order. It took 40 minutes for the correct dish to arrive, after we called. (I live close by) This place probably just gets customers because they deliver at late hours. I'm only giving it 1 star to comment. This place deserves 0 stars.  Intoxication alimentaire. (mauvais poulet) Restaurant à éviter."}
{"text":"Very Rude Service. Long Wait Time. Cold Food.  I've ordered from here 3 times now. Deliver always take over an hour.  The last time I ordered, we called back after 60min for an update, and the were hung up on. After 90min, we called back again and they insisted the food should already be there. The food arrived cold after a 2hr wait."}
{"text":"I ordered from here last night and felt like I ruined a meal. Granted, I only had the pad thai, but it was awful. Felt like over salted brown coloured noodle stir-fry. Very disappointing. Maybe other things are great on the menu, but I will never eat here again based on their pad thai."}
{"text":"After being a paying customer for years: Waited for two hours for my order, called, called gain, then they notified us they will not be delivering because we \"cancelled the order\". We obviously didn't. They're ridiculous, nobody should treat a customer like that."}
{"text":"This is probably my fourth and last time ordering from them.   Last time I ordered, they decided to ask for more money from me than usual. I spent about 20$ on myself and I usually eat everything by myself for a meal. The lady started being bossy with me, she asked that I order 10$ minimum before I ordered from the special 50% off menu. I agreed because I need to order 15$ minimum. She was so rude today. I think she got retrained and she turned cocky with her improvement. The total came in 21.30$ including the 3$ fee because it is so damn far. Right. I came from Brossard and it is like a walk in the park there.   After an hour and a half, the driver came. He asked me for the special coupon, I don't have it because they usually don't take coupons. I gave the coupon from the pamphlet.Then, he asked me for tips because I didn't put any. The 3$ more than covers it. He insisted I gave him tips. Since I have no cash on me, I couldn't give it to him. The way he insisted made me feel very uncomfortable. I will not spend any of my hard earned money in that restaurant again. It is more expensive than ordering pizza. Usually, I don't spend that much for myself in a vietnamese restaurant. What makes them think I will order 25$ from them where 10$ goes to the driver's fee, tips and taxes.   The food is not even that good enough for me to justify for the bad customer service."}
{"text":"We went here cause we got a Groupon, and I wont be going back! Our server was so rude and unprofessional, she even fought with us saying the groupon wasn't valid when it was. Aside from that, the food was so bland. No reason to come here at all, much better Vietnamese restaurants around."}
