{"text":"I love B.B.Ques! I always get the chicken sandwich and potato wedges, which comes to about $5.50, a great price! I have to admit that I've never tried anything else from here, mostly because I can't resist the chicken burger... it's a pretty small chicken breast, but yummy! And the wedges are always nicely spiced. One thing...they don't take debit, so be aware!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars (yelp add .5's please!)  'oh no they don't have pulled pork so I'm going to give this place one star!' gimme a break.  I was in a rush to a last minute movie at Cumberland and a friend suggested i hit this place. i dig the thrown together student vibey atmosphere. ordered the chicken sandwhich and spicy fries and got an Arizona for dranx ($8+), pretty dece.  this was perfect for my rush, although it took longer than the 6 minutes I was told, portions were fairly small and I downed it in the time takes to read two pages of eye weekly. about the same size as a mcchicken but grilled (you could taste flame!)  if I'm by u of t I'd hit it again if I needed a snack for sheezie."}
{"text":"The great thing about B.B.Ques is that it seems like they are always open and willing to deliver anything from wings to fresh squeezed juices and veggie dogs right to your door.    With very reasonable prices and a lot to choose from, it would take a while to try everything they have to offer.  I've never actually eaten in the restaurant, I've only ever had it delivered, but there is a little thrill to having someone show up to your house with ribs and smoothies!  There is a small charge for delivery, especially if you're outside of their area - although with it being a huge swath of downtown, from St. Clair to Lakeshore going North-South and Sherbourne to Dufferin going East-West (!), I'm not sure they could manage to deliver something warm outside of those boundaries.  They do manage to keep hot foods hot, cold foods cold, and smoothies from leaking all over, so it seems to me that they've got a pretty good delivery system in place.  Depending where you are, the wait varies but they will usually tell you a very accurate estimate up front, so there's no guessing when you'll get to tear into your chicken wings and salad."}
{"text":"going to have to say that this place is pretty mediocre, on the whole. i lived right across the street at Grad House for 2 years and so ordered from BBQues a few times. i usually got the 1/4 Chicken Dinner. the chicken fingers were usually very thin, bland, and tasteless. but edible, at least. i only went so often because there weren't really any other places to get chicken in the immediate area. but service was pretty fast, and generally the meal was filling (although not particularly satisfying)."}
{"text":"Wow, these people don't know how to listen. I walked in to get some food to go and specifically asked questions about the veggies and chicken breast. What did I get? A quarter chicken that that had no taste except for the sugary bbq sauce and potato wedges! Plus the place smelled very musty, and I should have just turned around and left when I got there. Sure, it was only 7 dollars and some change, but I should get what I ordered."}
{"text":"Food is decent but over priced. Don't bother ordering the chicken strips - sometimes you get less than other times, but it never feels worth the money you pay for it."}
{"text":"Cheap but not nasty, BBQues hits the spot as far as fast-food quick snacks go. I can get a veggie dog with a nice range of toppings, plus fries (I always opt for the delicious wedge-cut ones) for under $5 with change to spare. There's also a veggie burger on the menu for not much more, too.   There seem to be a bunch of options for the omnivorous too, but I don't pay a great deal of attention to detail when it comes to that - it's just good to know that I can go there with non-veg friends for a quick bite, is all.  Fairly standard drinks fridge - pop, iced tea, water, sugary sugarloads of sugar, etc. There's a small froyo bar, too. Seating is fairly limited, and I'm not sure how you'd go with waiting for takeout if it was super busy in there, as the layout can be a bit awkward.  As far as gourmet fare, BBQues is not it - but that's not why you're there. You're there to scoff a delicious mound of fast food guilty pleasure! Solid option on the outskirts of the Annex/UofT - forget that street meat cart and drop into this friendly little family owned joint."}
{"text":"I use to come here if I wasn't in the mood for pizza, which was next door. Most of the time I would grab the bbq chicken sandwhich with fries. Its nothing special but gets the job done. I have heard the vegetarian options are good but I have never tried them because I got meat on my mind when I hear BBQues. This place gives out coupons once and awhile and is ideal for students on a budget."}
{"text":"Earlier in 2010, this joint was doing groupons. $5 for $10 of food. I bought several of these vouchers and it later became a very disappointing experience. Despite it being so long ago, I still remember it and feel the need to dog on them when someone asks me about this place.   The issue I had is that the owner WILL try to scam you. When the owner is present, my portion seems significantly smaller. I know this because I had multiple vouchers. I went once when the owner was there and again when the owner was not.   I order skinless chicken breast with potato wedges and garlic bread. It costs about $12 so I really paid $5 + 2 with the voucher. The owner was present. I was shocked at how light the box was. When I opened it, I see that the chicken was paper thin. I had less than 10 pieces of potato wedges (and they weren't big ones). The garlic bread was bite size. I can finish 90% of it in one bite. Unacceptable. I wouldn't even pay $3 for this little food.  Next time I ordered half chicken with potato wedges and garlic bread. I figured there's got to be a limit to how much you can scam me on a half chicken. Same thing with the wedges. Small and few. Thankfully, the chicken portion is more reasonable this time but I still know the owner scammed me. Because the next time I went, the owner was not present. I ordered half chicken again and the staff filled up the box much better. He seemed to have picked out a SIGNIFICANTLY bigger piece of half chicken than the owner. I didn't know chicken sizes can vary so much.  Ok...so now I figure I can just go when the owner is not there. So the last time I went, they don't even accept the vouchers anymore and urged me to get a refund with the deal company. Unacceptable. They basically sold the vouchers to make a quick buck and then decided not to deliver.  Ignoring this fiasco with the voucher, I would not go to this restaurant. If the owner didn't scam me, I think the \"real\" portions are just passable for the price they charge. This place is slightly pricey. More importantly, I just can't recommend a place where the owner has the absolute power to screw you in portions.   Of course, you're wondering about the quality of the food. It's just so so. I think the chicken is overcooked as there are some burn marks on the food each time which I had to manually pluck off. Otherwise, it's just like eating at any other place with Chicken or Ribs (Swiss Chalet). Except of course, the other places will not try to scam you."}
{"text":"If you want BBQ go to Memphis, and I don't mean in Woodbridge -- or go to Phil's on College.  This here's a reliable delivery service for some things, like burgers, that don't normally qualify for same."}
{"text":"Their name should be rescinded.  This is not barbecue.  Just another wings, chicken and burger place that happens to also have some barbecue sauce (that's more like steak sauce) and ribs that are not slow cooked.  I first asked for pulled pork as well; for a lunch on the run, a rack of ribs is a rather difficult proposition.  I ordered beef ribs instead which came as cross section short ribs (Korean style- but not as tenderly fatty as Korean BBQ).  I will personally accompany owner and chef on a trip to Kansas City to try real barbecue, just let me know.  +Two stars, because it's good there's something other than warring pizza places, Subway and hot dog vendors near the University and there really isn't."}
{"text":"3.5 stars Good food for a good price.  I don't really know why their name has the word BBQ in it though...because it felt like people were ordering more of burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, fish and chips and fries when I went haha.  Maybe because it was lunch time?  Here's what my friends and I ordered: -Fish and chips -veggie dog and fries -beef hot dog and onion rings  I had the fish and chips and it was a total of around $7.  The order came with 1 piece of fish, fries (wedge style), a small side of coleslaw, and pre-packaged tartar sauce.  The fish and fries were fried very well, very crispy and not too oily.  I do wish they would've given me a wedge of lemon for my fish and chips though...  The veggie dog and beef hot dog that my friends had were pretty big in size.  They said that it was pretty good and the beef hot dog was really juicy.  All for under $5 (each)!  The service was also good.  They take your order and your name, you sit down and then they call you when your name when your food is ready.    Overall, it's a nice place for yummy, cheap and quick food."}
{"text":"B B Ques is a great place to get your BBQ type food fix for cheap. Having an attractive and well maintained decor, lots of choices of food (from chicken to ribs to sandwiches and the like) for cheap prices, it's not a bad choice if you're looking for decent food.  I especially like how they have their own homemade sauces which really makes this place special for me. I mean their food is good, but it's your run of the mill type place. The seasoning and the sauces are what make it special!"}
{"text":"Big fan of B.B. Ques! We've ordered from them twice and haven't been disappointed. The first time I ordered a ribs and wings combo and my boyfriend ordered their grilled chicken sandwich combo. We made the mistake of ordering on Superbowl Sunday but the person who took my order over the phone was very apologetic for any delays we were going to deal with, but his estimated delivery time was pretty accurate! The food was hot and the delivery guy was in great spirits, nice to see someone who likes their job! The ribs and wings were great and my boyfriend really enjoyed his chicken sandwich, good portion size on that one.  Last night we ordered a wing dinner and a jumbo veggie hot dog combo, as well as a deep fried apple pie and two cookies. Delivery was spot on 45 minutes (we ordered from just-eat.ca this time) and the food was hot and yum!! I like that with the wing/rib dinners, you get a little piece of garlic toast (can't complain about extra stuff!). The spicy fries are good (nothing unexpected though) and my boyfriend said the veggie dog was comparable to an all-beef hot dog and it was BIG. The apple pie was what I thought it would be but even after eating my entire meal, it was still nice and warm!   While I wouldn't call this the best BBQ place I've ever been to, its a great option for Friday night takeout around $25 for two.  To have BBQ delivered at these prices, you can't complain - the prices are reasonable, the serving sizes are good and we haven't been disappointed yet. I'll keep ordering from here in future!!"}
{"text":"Ordered from BBQues last night off Justeat. We were hungry, and felt like something \"american\". (Ie. my boyfriend wanted ribs). This was the only place on Justeat that had both ribs/wings and ANYTHING on the menu for a vegetarian. In fact, I was very excited.   We ordered the:  1. quessadilla rolls (7.95)  2. beef rib and half pound chicken wing dinner (18.95) 3. veggie burger (4.95) 4. medium garden salad ( about $5)   With the $3.50 delivery charge, and a tip for the driver, this came to $50!   The ribs and wings were mediocre at best. The veggie burger was clearly from a box, that had been microwaved, and thrown on a white bun, the garden salad was iceberg lettuce, poorly chopped tomato and a few cukes, and the \"quessadilla rolls\" were definitely something from Costco.   All in all, not only was this not good food, it was INCREDIBLY overpriced. This was NOT IN ANY WAY A $50 meal.   Not only that, the restaurant called us at 6 to confirm our order and tell us the driver was on the way. In fact, the food didn't arrive for another hour. After we called AND Justeat called to see what was going on.   i will NEVER order or go to this restaurant again. And I want my $50 back."}
