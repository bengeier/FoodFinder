{"text":"THEY HAVE TO BE WRITING THEIR OWN POSITIVE REVIEWS. this is possibly the worst pizza in the world. Was suggested to me and my bf by friends when we moved down the street. Getting into the specifics of what made this pizza so awful would take hours all I can say is it was literally inedible and I have been known to eat pizza from costco . We both ate about 2-3 bites  of our own pizzas and threw them out. I had a sore, jaw, teeth and a bad taste in my mouth.  I was tempted to ask for my money back which I have never ever done but i felt too bad for the little old lady!  Also we got take out and were waiting for almost an hour"}
{"text":"The previous yelper who gave this a 2 stars when she wasn't even a paying customer should not be giving reviews.  

I like the small restaurant atmosphere and OUR waitress took care of us really well.  Our water glasses were always filled, and even when they got one of our orders wrong, they replaced our order and gave the wrong order to us at no extra charge.  

The little Italian restaurant had a decent variety of wines and even an italian beer that I've never heard of.  Their wood-fired pizzas are delicious, and I've tried 3 of them.  They're thin crust, so although it seems pretty big, it's not THAT filling.

I'd definitely go back to this restaurant again to try out their other menu items."}
{"text":"Unbelievably bad. Worst excuse for a pizza I've seen, awful service. Used to be pretty decent (about a year ago). Frankly, they don't know what they are doing.

Pizza with little bits of sun dried tomato, tiny curled up slivers of eggplant and equally tiny chunks of black olives. Our party ordered 3 pizzas, the crust of all three was tough as cardboard - could not cut it with a serrated knife!

When, out of desperation, I asked for some Parmesan, I was told that they charge extra and that the owner did not recommend it any way, as it would dry out the pizza. 

Really? Charge extra for Parmesan? Not recommended - you must be kidding. I'm not asking for your recommendation, you're the one serving crappy pizza. 

Waitress was all over the table throughout the meal - literally reaching across and handing dishes to those seated on the other side, obviously untrained. 

\"Not recommended\""}
{"text":"The customer service here sucks. The place is nicely decorated and has a great location. The open fire oven lends a really authentic air but the server was really rude. We had an entertainment.com coupon and as soon as she saw it she told us that unless we had our card with us, we couldn't use it. No other place has required the card as well. She wasn't even apologetic or at all graceful about it, just straight up rude. Why even list your restaurant if you make it so hard to use? We didn't even bother staying after that so I can't comment on the food."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and two year old daughter. We were greeted by a lady who told us to sit at the table for two that was pretty tight in the corner. The restaurant was half empty and I couldn't understand  why we couldn't sit at a bigger table with more space.  She didn't even ask or offer to see if we needed a high chair, but for such a small restaurant, I guess there was no room to have any?  

Again, the restaurant was half empty and we were waiting for the menu for about 10-15 minutes - she was really busy talking to another group who were finished and about to leave (seem to be regulars to the restaurant). During this time, a party of three enters the restaurant and she told them to sit at the table for four.  After the party that she was talking to left, she went to the back and then came out to give menus to the party of 3 that came in after us!!  This is when my wife had a bad feeling about the service and suggested that we leave, but I decide to give it a chance - which later I regretted. 

So after about 10-15 minutes, she finally comes to our table with our menu. She was about to leave so I had to stop her to order water for us - again, we have a two year old with us, so I would have thought she would be a bit more thoughtful. 

The menu wasn't impressive at all, with the few choice of meat entrees being at least $18. We end up ordering two pizzas, my wife ordered the one with pepperoni and roasted mushrooms and red peppers, while I ordered the seafood pizza (with shrimps, scallops, and fake crab). During the wait for our food, my daughter was asking us to have some bread, so we asked if we can get a basket of bread or dinner rolls for our daughter (which another table have already). Her response was unexpected. \"Your pizza is almost done. \". And she walked away only to return with our pizza 5 minutes later!

My wife's pizza was burnt by the the crust, which can be obviously seen her the server, while my pizza wasn't burnt but was lacking toppings (there were only one small/medium size shrimp on each slice of the 4 slice pizza, and there were small traces if scallops which I could hardly taste). 

We continued to eat the dissatisfied meal, where the lady didn't even bother to ask if we wanted a refill on our drinks, which we clearly needed since our glass was empty!

When it came to paying, we used the coupon from the Entertainment book, and I my credit card to cover the rest, only to be told that she doesn't accept credit cards on bills under $25!  Our total came up to $20.xx and I didn't carry cash since I never had a problem with this before.  So I had to go across the street to withdraw money from the ATM.

Overall, horrible service, food just average, and it was overpriced for what we got, and NOT family friendly at all!

I live in the area so I can definitely recommend better Italian restaurants that are about 5 minutes away. 

Didn't leave much of a tip - even though my wife said not to. My only tip for the restaurant owner is this - PLEASE work on your customer service and on your menu. 

Final note:  I went to this restaurant over 15 years ago, and I remember the food AND service was much better back then."}
{"text":"ok it's no fluke the wood oven pizza here is very good. (we ordered two kinds to try)

the dough, sauce and cheese the base ingredients of most any pizza are top notch. 

the crust i would describe.. it's not a thin where it's paper thin and it's not cooked crisp like I've had at  many other thin crust pizza places. having its so crisp hides the true identity of the pizza dough. how can one taste the crust if it's burnt!?

the crust is thin where one can bite into the dough know it's dough and not thick enough to not overwhelm the toppings. 

my quattro stagione was made wrong though.. it suppose to be separate quarters of pizza with the individual toppings. but instead it was a pizza with all the toppings. 

c'mon just because I don't look italian doesn't mean I don't know how it's suppose to be. don't give me stupid excuses that  things get roughed up in the oven that why that make it that way?

i don't care for the chatty waitress here and the ridiculous excuses, but as i mentioned in my first review. i will come here for the food because the cooks and chefs in the back know what they are doing.."}
{"text":"reading the reviews at Alegno i think the yelpers are doing the place a disservice. Yes the service is slow and inefficient and the owner has only one debit machine, and yes it can be SUPER annoying when you are in a hurry. BUT the pizza is honestly the best in Toronto. if you are patient do it. the pizza is from a brick stove fired by wood. for some reason its just awesome. worth the wait."}
{"text":"Six of us had a very nice time and really liked our food at Alegno's.  The service was perfect and the food delicious.  This is our neighbourhood Italian place, and we'll definitely go back!  Nothing fancy about it (butter in packets), but very nice ambiance and good prices."}
{"text":"family owned italian restaurant.

short summary: very yummy food, portions could be bigger, sometimes slow service but very friendly lady owner, always packed at lunch, which is frustrating since they dont accept reservations.

longer summary: the decoration of the restaurant is very cozy and gives a feeling of a patio dining even though it's all indoors. 
the service though slow is very friendly and we often end up chatting with the owner for few minutes while we're waiting for the order.

it usually gets very packed at lunch by the people from surrounding office buildings. and since they don't accept reservations sometimes it means that you have to arrive right after the doors are open (which is 1130am everyday I think)

in general very welcoming place but a bit on a pricey side."}
{"text":"This place camouflages in the plaza, like silver cars do on the street.  It's on the second floor of a little strip mall, which is conveniently located on Yonge Street, a block North of the 401.  The store front is nothing to be admired, and the inside of the restaurant is super small... 

I went here one late night, we were the only patrons in the restaurant - so needless to say, SUPER quiet.  I wasn't planning on eating anything, I just came for the company, and my friend ordered a pizza.  Our waitress at the restaurant told us that because today was a quiet night, we would be allowed to stay. But on a regular night, both of us would have to order something.  Now, I completely understand and agree with that concept, but to have her spell it out to us on a dead night, was a little too much.  That really turned me off to the restaurant. They should be trying to woo customers, not scare them with threats.  

Anyway, I had a little bit of the pizza - thin crust, stone baked. It wasn't bad, but I've had better at Amato's pizza for a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"This place is nothing but rules, rules, rules! 

How about I help you fellow yelpers out by telling you not to bother with this place. No means it is a \"hidden gem\" more like the wicked witch who is on top of a tiny strip mall. That being said...

I was always worried about coming to this place, it's close by and it would be nice having a Italian restaurant in the area but coming on a quiet night, and from the moment we walked being told how it is made me come to realization that this place isn't going to work out.

There was two ladies at a table when we arrived, very quiet. The tables are super small and we asked to sit in a bigger table but were quickly told that we couldn't. Even though obviously there wasn't a line up of people waiting for a table.. 

The water was warm, I guess ice water is extra. I decided on a pizza, I asked if I could change the mushrooms to onions and I was rudely told I couldn't. You aren't allowed to change anything, what if I was allergic to mushrooms.. Being that this our first time here and it was quiet you think she would want to accommodate you, think again!

If you would like to add some chicken or peppers to your pasta, be prepared to pay for the cost of two pasta's! Chicken was 4.95 which seems a little high for some chicken. Peppers were 2.95 for red and wait.... 2.95 for green. I can go buy the whole peppers for that much! Maybe 2.95 for both red and green peppers is alright...  but 2.95 for each.....

We had the entertainment coupon and so did the table next to us. She came back and gave them back their card and said she didn't punch it so they can come back.  When she took our card we heard \"crunch\" and came back and gave us our card back without saying anything. No surprise there though as we wouldn't be coming back anyway.

As we went to pay, she tells us that we can't pay with visa because it was under $20 bucks. The bill was $19 and some cents. Yet again another rule to add to the reasons of why not to come to this place. Needless to say there was no tip left and I'm pretty sure she is the owner, she needs to learn to run a restaurant and be a people person. And you wonder why you have no business..."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night with family. A very nice cutesy little restaurant. Those tend to be the better ones. Note, the restaurant is at the top of a staircase so be prepared for the climb. Food was generally good. We ordered two orders of bruschetta for the table and they both disappeared in instants. Very good. My mom and I had the same dish (penne arrabbiata) while my cousins had ravioli and capellini. While my cousins seemed to enjoy their dishes, I must say that although the dish that mom and I had was quite tasty, we wish we could have enjoyed it more. The sauce was entirely too spicy and tasted like someone had been a little too generous with the pepper. This made it hard to eat and had to be taken slowly. It didn't say on the menu that it was loaded with pepper or was spicy. Service was pleasant and started off well but became a little spotty later on. Over all, a nice place but if we come back, we'll be sure to order something different next time!"}
{"text":"Since my original review I have gone back another few times AND been to Italy. When I went to Italy I was expecting all of the food to be as good as, if not better than what I had at Alegno. Well, if we were lucky, it was as good. Which means I'm guessing this as good as it gets! The food truly is exceptional! 

We went again last weekend and ordered the special, which was amazing as always. We were very hungry, but they gave us two baskets of bread, no problem. One of the nicest things was that I ordered amaretto and ginerale. They brought them out separately and I had to add them together, but they kept bringing me refills of my ginerale. By the end my drink obviously had no more alcohol, but I thought it was so nice that they felt they should refill my drink all the same. 

It's a small place and entirely family run, so the service is sometimes slow and they will sometimes run out of specials, because I guess they make only so many/night, but that just proves the family-run business atmosphere and the homemade food. It doesn't get better!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I came here for NY's eve. We def. cannot wait to come back again. 

We ordered the daily pasta special (sausage, mushrooms) & a pizza (Alla Peccorina, w/ black olive paste, garlic, mozzarella, goat chese, spinach & black olives). Both meals were delicious & portions were somewhat big. I have half a pizza left for dinner tonight :) It was heavenly & crispy ! What a way to end the year. Please see my pics :D Hard to resist eh?

We also ordered the Bruchetta but that was just alright.

Service was excellent. The friendly lady/owner(?) came by to speak w/ us on several occasions. Same can be said for their other patrons. Ambiance was romantic & cozy.

Close to Sheppard Station"}
{"text":"This is only the 2nd time in my entire life that I haven't left a tip.

Looks like the pizzas are made fresh in house but the pastas are not. Menu states \"Fresh potato gnocchi\" but when I asked to confirm it was made fresh I was told it's not fresh. Disappointing and misleading. The pasta dishes are way over priced for what you get ( in terms of quality, portions sizes are decent)

Very poor service. Took an unreasonably long time to be seated, receive menus and have our orders taken. Once our pasta dishes arrived the server said she would be back with fresh cheese....we never saw her again, until we flagged her down to pay. This place is small and was not that busy.  

When it came time to pay we were told they would not do separate bills (there were only 2 of us). We each wanted to pay debit/credit but were told the minimum purchase for this is $20.  (this place really doesn't want people to pay separately...).  

I believe our server was one of the owners because as she rudely told us \"I can make what ever policies I want\" after we questioned the $20 minimum. \"If everyone paid separately it would take too long\". Not sure how she could say this when there were only 2 tables with people in the entire place!! I'm really beginning to lose my patience with the lazy servers of Toronto. 

I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Alegno Restaurant? Where is it? My Yelp Drinking Buddy went \"huh\"? 

If you drive, there is complimentary parking, entrance at the back of the building. Or you can park on the side street, free parking on weekends or weekdays after 6 pm.

Alegno is definitely a family owned restaurant with the Italian mama in the house. Mama is no nonsense and efficient... don't expect professional service. You get your food and eat it and at least all the food we ordered are decent.

Margherita ($8.95) is not bad... just wish for fresh basil... The crust is on the crispy side.

Fish of the Day - Tilapia ($ 21.95) I found it is over seasoned

Homemade Tiramisu ($6.95) definitely not for sharing. Smallish in portion but was soaked in coffee liquor

We finished all the food we ordered, and of course Mama shown her approval..."}
