{"text":"Very good food, great outdoor eating area. Fast and efficient service as well. Great pepper butter with your toasty warm bread."}
{"text":"Dad said \"It's not that it's bad, it's just that it's not any good\". No spices, herbs, salt, pepper in cooking. Food not hot. \"Aged cheddar melt\"  tasted like Velveeta. Steak portion small & waitress scarce. No drink menu. Special given verbally without price included in information.  On the bright side, Birthday Girl given free ice cream sundae & atmosphere  decent (if you don't mind screams in background, football-related)"}
{"text":"If I could figure out a way to give no or minus stars, I would.  I had the worst meal and service that I've ever had at a restaurant!  I made a reservation two weeks in advance for a Sunday brunch for my family - 19 people - and Hawthorns was virtually empty except for us.  After being told when the reservation was made that we could order off the breakfast or lunch menu, we were told when we arrived that we could only order breakfast (11:30 reservation , lunch didn't start until noon).  We were only given the lunch menus, however, and finally were given five breakfast menus to share.  Next problem, no drinks (coffee or water) were provided for almost 30 minutes, it took over an hour to get the breakfast food and more than half of the orders were wrong - eggs weren't cooked right, some didn't have hash browns as ordered, either the plate didn't have toast or the toast wasn't what was ordered, and most of the food was cold.  It took forever to get water, coffee refills, butter for the french toast, cream for the coffee, etc.  I could go on and on about this meal, but I think you get the point.  Service was terrible - supposedly they were short on staff, but there were only two tables filled in the entire restaurant - and the food was definitely not worth the wait.  Breakfast really isn't that hard and the menu had so few choices, most of us had eggs or french toast.  Oh I almost forgot the positive - because of our experience, they generously took the drinks off the bill.  Trust me, this in no way made up for the terrible meal and service.  We didn't go somewhere looking for a cheap meal, but the one we got was definitely not worth ANY cost!  Our family gets together about once a month for brunch and I can guarantee none of us will ever go back to Hawthorns, either for brunch or any other time.   This isn't the first time my husband and I had eaten there, but it will definitely be the last.  We've never had terrific service at hawthorns before, and the food has typically been good (not great but better than average), but after this experience life is way too short and there are much, much better restaurants around."}
{"text":"Food and service were terrific.  The time it took to prepare our order was too long though.  Atmosphere and ambiance were nice and they had a decent children's menu."}
{"text":"While Hawthorn's suffers from a mixed atmosphere of half sportsbar, half steak diner, I had an overall positive experience.    My party of two was seated immediately on arrival, granted in the bar section rather than the dinner area.  It was quite busy for a Wednesday evening.    Our waitress took about 10 minutes to get to us, but with how many people were there it certainly wasn't bad.  Throughout our meal the waitress was attentive and apologetic whenever there was even the slightest wait.  We were checked on by the waitress, hostess and owner, which was nice, but one-after-another was a little much.    Appetizer, soup and salad were served shortly after ordering.  Spinach&Artichoke dish was decent, though questionable to serve with half vegetables instead of full crostini.  Cheese and Beer soup was excellent.  Salad was fine, mixed baby greens, veg and excellent croutons, however would not recommend the Champagne Vinaigrette.    Croutons were the best part, and actually seemed to be made on site, there's a first!    We ordered two New York Strip steaks for the entree, one rare and one medium rare.  They were cooked Perfectly, I was shocked, considering I haven't had a properly cooked steak in all of Madison.  Unfortunately, the steaks themselves were badly butchered, but they had great flavor.    The biggest con of the place was that it took me 20 minutes to eat my steak as a combination an overly stuffed plate with a super-wide lip and the weirdest steak knife I have ever used, serrated but with more of a santuko style than a standard steak knife.  Both my partner and I had a horrible time trying to cut our steaks.  I would highly recommend ordering your steak served on a different plate than your sides.    TLDR Version:  Great food, wacky dishes that make them hard to eat.  Good service, but somewhat confusing atmosphere.  Would eat there again."}
