{"text":"I had the $34 pre fixed menu, cheese starter with truffled honey and a seafood pasta main course. I requested a tomato based sauce as opposed to the cream sauce (all 3 dinner options were cream sauced). Upon arrival, I could smell the tinny tomato can smell, and I knew the sauce would be undercooked, which it was. The dish came with two large shrimp, a few mussels and clams and crab claws, which made for ungraceful dining. Not sure how cracking the crab claws open that are covered in tomato sauce makes much sense. The dessert was nice and the waiter was attentive, even though I had ordered the salad as my starter and not the cheese. My friends pizza was \"ok\" he said. Nice decor, easy parking but overall not the bang for my buck I was hoping for."}
{"text":"First time at Tre Colori. Decor was nice, the wait staff was pleasant and prompt. We ordered a pizza which we enjoyed. We are looking forward to another visit to give the rest of the menu a try ."}
{"text":"Meilleur pizza en ville. Les p√¢tes sont excellente et la sauce vraiment italienne, tout est bon!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!! We were a group of 18 and we waited 3h30 before getting our main meal.  The owner told us that it was normal and we were not in a McDonald, what a prick...  Last time for sure"}
