{"text":"We went to District oven in the context of Winterlicious.
The food was amazing. and portion sizes were adequate. On the basis of that you should definitely give the place a try.

However, the service left a lot to be desired.... so much so that even the table next to us were complaining. We came into an empty restaurant to a confused hostess who did not know where to seat us.

Once we were seated, we ordered our meals. When the same two appetizers came (dips and sauces), we had one piece of bread for the two appetizers. Every other table had two breads for two appetizers. We kindly asked the waitress... three times in the span of 30 minutes. No acknowledgement. It should not be that difficult to get a piece of bread. Waitress could not care less about our table. While taking our order she spoke over us to the table across, which was pretty rude.

Food took a while to come out, and the general consensus was that there were too few waiters/waitresses for the amount of people."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and it's been amazing both times! It has a nice ambience, a bit laid back, which is nice. The servers were quite nice and helpful with suggestions. I loved the kafta burger, even the fries it came with were delicious!! I ordered several appetizers, including two different kinds of pizza, over both visits and they were all yummy! Best to go with a group in order to share a number of items."}
{"text":"Fantastic mezze plates. Fresh ingredients, distinct flavours and friendly staff. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very underwhelming experience.  Ordered Lamb Tangine was terrible, just a lot of gristly and super fatty lamb (meat was not cut properly at all!!) Hallumi tasted like slabs of salt. We had 5 different servers over meal, no soap or toilet paper in washroom. The worst part was cost of drinks!! $50 for a litre of sangria with so much fruit and ice in it, there was only 3 drinks! All beverages VERY watered down and too $$ for what you get. Ultimately, it was $200 for 2 people, and I felt ripped off."}
{"text":"Had drinks here on a Wednesday night, the place was completely empty. The menu did not look very appealing so we did not try anything. They had a good selection of drinks. Ordered a rum and coke which tasted like maple syrup and had a beer, which tasted completely off and had things floating in it. We didn't even finished our drinks and left (good thing we didn't order food). We will not be returning and would caution people to avoid this place."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. First time food was salty and sauces were generic. Second time I was with a friend from out of town and we needed to catch a quick meal before he hit the road. I should have known better. Despite the fact that it was almost empty the maitre d' told us we might not be able to get a table because they were booked. What a joke. Place never even got a third full on a Friday night. Food was as bad as the time before. There are lots of better placed within 100m. And prices are pretty steep for the middling quality of dishes. Want something funky? Cross the street and go to Southern Accent. Hip? pray tell is a couple doors away. Homestyle? Get an excellent draft beer and a good meal at a reasonable price from the Caledonian a few doors further."}
{"text":"first time here, came for my birthday dinner. food was delicious. service was spotty, thank goodness the food was not. we ordered a lot of food, hot and cold mezze, grilled meats, etc. meatball fatteh, lamb poutine and grilled beef were standouts. pita was so fresh and soft. the place was busy, ambience was nice - will definitely go back. hopefully they'll have worked out the kinks in their wait staff."}
{"text":"Food was good, dessert was fantastic. I didn't like the fact that they charged me for each club soda I ordered while we all know that it is 'carbonated tap water'. I paid the same amount for the club sodas I would have paid if I had ordered a bottle of Perrier at a restaurant. District oven should reconsider this."}
{"text":"Went last night.  The food was pretty good for Winterlicious, but my god was the service bad.  I don't think I've ever experienced something like that.  It was busy, but if you're only going to have two seatings, make sure you're staffed!  Our waitress was entirely uninterested in us.  It took 40 minutes after we finished to get the bill and pay (even when we asked for it).  Terrible, terrible service.  I wouldn't go back.  There are much better restaurants with much better service (and food for that matter)."}
{"text":"4/5! Highly recommend this place. It is much better than most of the middle-eastern restaurants in Toronto. For starters, get the fig & cheese pizza, grilled eggplant and any of the dips. As a main, I recommend the lamb tangine and kafta burger. The only dish I was disappointed with was the cauliflower steak (average). The food is extremely filling so its best to go with a large group so you can try a bit of everything. I also recommend trying the cocktails with DISTRICT in the name. Overall, a great place to go with friends before a night out on Ossington."}
{"text":"I had the kufta burger. The lady had something the name of which has slipped my mind now. Both were delicious. The other food I saw getting served there looked amazing. Top marks for the food, but I could barely hear my wife or the server. It wasn't crazy busy, but the acoustics in there are terrible. The tin ceiling might have a lot to do with it. That's a pet peeve of mine, but not one that would keep me from going back.

Try it out."}
{"text":"Nice setting, very spacious unlike some of the other spots in that area. 

A quick note for those who aren't a fan of lamb and the smell- you should def avoid ordering any lamb dish, be it the kefta burger (made of lamb and beef) or the lamb dish. 

The fish of the day ( sounded like the waiter said it was Sebring (sp?) ) was very good."}
{"text":"Excellent middle eastern food.  I didn't love the meat skewers, but everything else was amazing.  We had a lentil/quinoa pilaf, calamari, hummus, assortment of dips/spreads, lots of bread, roast cauliflower, all of which were excellent. And the bread!!  I've been a few times and have been impressed every time.

My one complaint (and the reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars):  Why does this restaurant only have one highchair? It's clearly a family friendly place - it's spacious and I've often seen kids there.  Why not buy a few $15 highchairs (or at least booster seats) from Ikea? The restaurant is HUGE - it has lots of seating and lots of room for highchairs -in fact, it is one of the largest restaurants I've been to in Toronto.  A couple of extra highchairs/boosters would pay for themselves in a few days.  We were going to go one night and ended up going somewhere else because we called ahead and were told the highchair was being used.  If they had an extra highchair it would have paid for itself that night!"}
{"text":"Visited with fellow diners a few weeks ago. Was excited to try this new middle eastern food, as this tends to be one of my more preferred cuisines. Overall experience was a 6/10.

Service 8/10 - very friendly but slow; had to wait over 20 minutes for our bottle of wine.

Food was a 6/10 - appetizers were excellent as were the flatbreads, but mains were overpriced, portions were small, and just downright weren't that good! So disappointing. 

Ambiance - 7/10
Overall value - 5/10

Really wanted to like this place as I love this type of food, but prices, value and food leaves too much to be desired. Doubt I'll be back :("}
{"text":"Great space - high ceilings and modern decor. Excellent for a date or a large group. Doesn't get too loud as the tables are well spaced. 

Appetizers are over-priced. A small plate of spicy cauliflowers for $10 is criminal. 

Sides such as fries and couscous are tasty and well priced.

Main courses include kefta burger, duck, and platter of varies keftas (chicken,beef, lamb) grilled. The kefta platter is great for sharing among 2-3 people and goes well with both pita, rice or couscous. 

Overall, the ambiance, space and service deserve high points. However, the food is strictly above average and on the pricier side. The chef should rethink the use of this one tahini based spicy sauce that seems to be on a number of dishes."}
{"text":"We've been a few times to this restaurant, the food is really great and they have an impressive drinks menu.  We've loved the pizzas, the humous, falafel, meatballs and beer inspirate cocktails the most.  

It's a huge restaurant, which is rare downtown with several distinct section each beautifully decorated.  Also an accessible washroom on the main floor of the restaurant ( there are some 2-3 steps to get into the restaurant though. 

Even with all the space I think the staff really try hard to cram people together or rush people through their meal.   We've enjoyed several meals with multiple families and many kids without disturbing other diners."}
{"text":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!
NEVER AGAIN!!!!!
PERHAPS TO BUSY AT THIS TIME TO WORRY ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!! (any good business owner knows better)

It was my husbands 55th birthday, so I decided to plan a fun evening for him including the new aquarium, then dinner and finally dessert.

I searched for hours on the internet for a mediterranean restaurant that looked interesting and came across DISTRICT OVEN.

About two weeks in advance I made a reservation for 3 which was confirmed.  I then called a few days later to up the reservation to more people and received a voicemail (which I saved) from the manager confirming my request.   I called back personally to confirm and was assured by another staff member that yes the reservation was made.  (So two verbal and one voicemail confirmations of reservation in total).

On the evening of his birthday about half way through the aquarium, I called the restaurant as were running to a little ahead of schedule to see if we could perhaps move the reservation to 7:30.  AND TO MY SURPRISE THE HOSTESS SAID SHE DIDN'T HAVE A RESERVATION FOR US (WHICH I COULDN'T BELIEVE), but after I gave her the names of the people who confirmed the reservation and told her I had a confirmed (and saved) message from the manager that I would be happy to play, she said we could come on buy.

When we arrived we were seated at the worst table, closest to the door and that would be shared by others later.

I quickly asked to speak to the manger who moved us to a somewhat better table and I thought for a moment, \"ok - things happen - the evening will be better from here on in and let's give them a chance\"

We placed our drink order first and SURPRISE - they were out of two of the beers.

We placed our food order which arrived slowly and things we ordered never showed up.  

Also, with our order for 5 people came 2 pitas which were only refilled after we asked several times.

Arriving at 8, we didn't get our mains until well after 9:30 and not all at once.

The food was OK,  the service was at best MEDIOCRE , so basically the overall experience was ONCE NOT TO BE REPEATED.

ANY GOOD ESTABLISHMENT WHO SCREWED UP SO MUCH WOULD OF (AT LEAST YOU WOULD THINK) DROP BY TO ASK IF EVERYTHING WAS OK NOW OR MAYBE PROVIDE A COMPLIMENTARY DRINK OR DESSERT.

THE MANAGER NEVER DROPPED BY TO SEE HOW WE WERE DOING.

WELL DISTRICT OVEN - NEVER AGAIN 

I WILL NOT BE RETURNING AND HAVE ALREADY PASSED MY THOUGHTS ON TO MANY OTHER."}
{"text":"I will not be returning to this establishment because service here was atrocious.

We came here for a birthday party, our table consisted of a group of 11 people and everything started off well when we were seated for our 7:30 PM reservation.  Our waitress was pleasant enough but extremely slow with bringing us our water and bread and finally came around to taking everyone's order by 8:00 PM. 

The waitress recommended we try the calamari for the appetizer, since we had been debating between hummus and another appetizer selection, so we agreed and emphasized to her that we want the calamari, not the hummus.  We also ordered the lamb tangine to share for the main, as she said it would be enough for us two.  For drinks, I ordered a $9 glass of white wine. 

I wish I could actually give a review of the lamb tangine main course, because as of 9:37 PM, our main course stlil had not arrived, although people at our table had received their appetizers and main courses.  The waitress would do an obligatory round to our table every 30-45 minutes to ask us how we were enjoying our food, and seeing that we had not received our main course, assured us she will go remind the chefs.  No such luck with our lamb tangine.  As of 10:17 PM, we cancelled our main course order, as we received no explanation for why our food had not come after almost 2.5 hours since our order.  She gave us no difficulty with cancelling the order, which implied that the kitchen probably never even started cooking it.

To add insult to injury, we were billed incorrectly.  She made separate bills, and I know it is difficult to keep track of people's orders when it is a large group, however this is the worst 'separate bills' process I have experienced.  She billed us by arbitrarily assigning hummus and the calamari, then she asked us 'you had the wine, right?\" and added a $12 wine cost, when my wine order was for $9.  Simply unacceptable.

Do not come here if you expect professional and timely food service and if you do, remember to check your bill carefully.  The taste of their food is bland in comparison to the terrible service you may be getting if you happen to come here in a group larger than 4 people.  Their menu offerings are not special compared to what you can get at other places."}
{"text":"A lovely place to catch up with an old friend over some great food and wonderful service.

I moved to Ottawa for school and was in town this evening visiting friends and family. My girlfriend and I wanted to catch up over dinner and I was in charge of picking the place. I stumbled upon District Oven after BlogTO had done a little feature on them. I was in the mood for Mediterranean food and it was in the neighbourhood that wasn't too far from where my girlfriend worked. I saw photos of the place online and thought it was absolutely gorgeous. In my books, the environment is the key to setting the tone for a intimate conversation with an old friend. This place truly delivered. 

I loved the decor - stylish and eclectic with its wooden decor (tables were made from reclaimed wood, as was the bar!) but incredibly warm and inviting too with plenty of space to bring in a large group of people. The lighting was absolutely gorgeous with the fire burning from the oven and candles lit up everywhere. 

The food was lovely - wonderful flavours, fresh ingredients, and hot bread on the fly. We had a delicious red pepper dip, falafel with a stew which we dipped our bread in.  I am someone who loves trying different dishes and doing the whole tapas thing so this offered that and individual platters if you don't like sharing. The food is all halal too, which is an amazing touch for those with dietary restrictions. 

This place is a hidden gem - super warm and inviting and classy without being pretentious. The food is delicious and extremely reasonably priced. Service was great too! I will definitely come back when I visit Toronto again. I am tired of those small restaurants in Toronto that are crammed and where they rush you out the door. This restaurant is spacious and beautiful - a great place to bring a family or a group of friends."}
{"text":"When we first walked in it was very quiet but time we left it was extremely busy. The food and service were great. Lots of veggie options. My friends enjoyed the chicken shish tawook. The hummus, labneh, babaghanoush, pepper and walnut dip were all flavourful. Try the lemon mint Cosmo to have a middle eastern inspired drink. We were too full to try the deserts but they appeared to have good options."}
{"text":"Excellent food, staff and atmosphere. The decor is beautiful and the food is one of a kind. The falafel is the best I have ever had. The flat breads fresh out of their big beautiful oven are delicious."}
{"text":"This place offered a really nice dining experience. The food is really tasty. However, don't come here if you're expecting a meal or if you're really hungry. The portions are small and pricey."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to get to this fairly new restaurant, and finally made it over on a lovely Sunday evening.  Windows open to the street and lots to look at inside made for a pleasant environment.  Menu FULLl of interesting items and combinations; our server had lots of patience for our questions and our taking our time. My companion gave big thumbs up to the baked cauliflower app, and I very much enjoyed my flatbread with haloumi, fig and scallions.  Server was also helpful about the wine options and we checked out more than a couple!  A lovely evening!"}
{"text":"My new favourite restaurant. We had a bachelorette party (dinner) on Saturday. The restaurant had such an amazing ambiance and was very inviting. Besides the spectacular Mediterranean/middle eastern food we devoured, the staff at this place was top notch! Our rambunctious bunch were never shunned by management or the patrons of the restaurant. In fact, they were all generally excited for the bride to be and joined in on the fun and games. We spoke with the manager afterwards and shook his hand for an amazing experience. We will all be back again!! Thank you all at District Oven for such a wonderful time. You made the night memorable and loads of fun!! Xoxo"}
{"text":"I had this place written down as somewhere to try and we needed to be in the neighbourhood after dinner so we gave it a shot.  Overall impression was mediocre and I doubt I'll be returning.

Arrived at the restaurant on a Friday evening at about 6pm to find myself the only client in the place.  It was so deserted I questioned whether it was actually open.  The hostess came over and asked if I had a reservation (I didn't) and proceeded to coolly tell me I should've made one due to how busy it will get.  Once again I'd like to point out there was not ONE person in the place.  Miraculously she managed to fit us in, though I could already tell by that time I would probably never come back.  First impressions - restaurant staff should know better.

Our male server was actually quite nice and helpful.  We tried some beer cocktails (I learned I do not like beer cocktails..) and shared two items.  The variety of cheese pizza wasn't too bad but fairly salty.  The other item was a salad and it was fairly bland.  By the time we left the restaurant, three more tables were occupied.  The massive rush must have arrived after 8pm.

Overall, my District Oven experience included unexceptional food, unnecessary rudeness and, in my mind, an inflated bill for the quality we received. I think I'll find my Middle Eastern fix elsewhere.."}
{"text":"I dined alone and was seated by the window by the host, she said I would have the best people watching there - I agreed!  I ordered the Kefta Burger (Arugula, Fig Jam, Brie, Spiced Frites) and a pint of Okanagan Pale Ale. Everything was what it said it was and very very good. Server came over asking \"how is the burger\" and I said \"SHUT UP YOU KNOW THIS IS GOOD\" and she laughed, confessing that she enjoys one weekly. Great service, atmosphere, and food. Will eat again!"}
{"text":"Everything is amazing! I went for a private event that has samples of most of the menu items. I'm still dreaming about the food."}
{"text":"Frankly speaking, I have no previous encounter with true Mediterranean food. All is new to me. The place is half open with warm lights. Except for the air conditioning, everthing is good. For some seats, the cool air just went straight toward you, made it a bit chilly especially during nights. Waiters are really helpful since I asked quite some questions about the ingredients of food."}
{"text":"We went on the first night of summerlicious to retry this restaurant (was there a year ago). Made a reservation for 6 pm and we were the only ones in there. A little weird. They didn't have the wine I asked for so I went with the recommendation. They were out of the beer my hubby wanted, then the second, then the third so he went with what they had. bad start. Apps were tasty (shrimp, mezzes) but last year the bread was fresh baked out of the oven. This year it was cold pita. My main was daily fish (salmon) which was meh. Everything was over salted, all I could taste. My hubby enjoyed the lamb shoulder. Dessert was weak. Baklava was just ok. The berries with creme frèche was missing the creme frèche. Not worth the $100 cost for mediocre food. I would have been happier with falafels fir $10 to get my Mediterranean fix. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I visited District Oven for a special occasion where we made a reservation for the back half of the restaurant. They offered us a prix fixe shareable menu that may or may not be reflective of the service they normally provide. 

District Oven is a very inviting place to host an event (ie. birthday) for 20-30 people. They offerred a $35 prix fixe menu that includes a number of shareable dishes to try within your table. Their appetizers, which included a variety of breads and dips, were all very good and tasty. Their bread was particularly fluffy, and delicious enough for us to ask for multiple extra orders.

The two pizzas offered next were the highlight of our meal. They were moist and crispy, and evidently made with very fresh ingredients.

The \"entree\", however, is where our party became confused. We were given one plate of mixed grilled items - which was expected to serve the 6 people seated at our table. Because of this extremely limited quantity, each person ended up only getting one bite of each meat, and we were left very hungry. 

This was quite unfortunate, as every other part of the experience was great. The service was good, and they were kind enough to let us stay until closing time, but the price was far too steep to only have a few bites of their entree.

Again, this may have only been the case because of the situation I was in, and may not be indicative of their normal service. The food was still first class and definitely worth returning for. 

I'll definitely still recommend District Oven for the food quality. Make sure you order the pizza!"}
{"text":"They were slightly backed up with orders and manager gave my prix fixe meal for free!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Spacious, great service, food is incredible.

Order the calamari. Actually, order two, cause one won't be enough. Meatballs rock, duck tagine too."}
{"text":"OMG -- we came here with a large group for a rehearsal dinner.

Their food is awesome.

There were so many things on offer, but we loved the kebabs, the kofta, the salads, the dips -- and they make their own pita right in their open oven.

Decor is really comfortable and modern.  The front opens up and allows for almost like patio seating.  There is a huge space in the back for groups and some comfortable sofas for visiting over drinks.

Here are the things I liked the best:

Flatbread Pizza - Chicken, Caramelized Onions, Sumac, Almonds 
Hummous
Labaneh with Zatar and Sesame
Fatoush Salad, Feta Cheese, Pita, Sumac Dressing
Quinoa Lentil Pilaf, Caramelized Onion, Village Salad 
Mix Grill of Lamb Kefta, Vegetable, Chicken & Beef Kabab, Duck Sausage on Vadouvan Flatbread 
Warm homemade Pita

Parking is on the Street
Closest Intersection is College and Ossington (just west of)"}
{"text":"We recently visited district oven for summerlicious 2015, so this review is based on that menu. First impressions - huge, open, beautiful space, great decor; prompt, friendly, and professional service. At our table we had:

- two cocktails: berry stormy and Toronto storm - both were refreshing and flavourful while still being quite strong. Definitely worth a try. 

- appetizers: mezze platters, meatballs, and beet salad. Everything on the platter was outstanding, as was the bread it came with. You have to ration the dips for how much bread you get (more bread than dips), but if you plan your scoops ahead you'll be fine. Zalouk and labneh were especially good. Meatballs were tasty and saucy. Beet salad had potential but lacked flavour entirely. This may have just been an off night for the salad though, as it's been good on other occasions apparently. The server was super nice when we mentioned this and brought extra mint dressing, but even that was flavourless. 

- mains: lamb shank, cauliflower, and fish (trout). All excellent. You'd think the cauliflower would be meh, but it's bursting with flavour, and the mushrooms take it to the next level. 

- desserts: two milk puddings and two baklavas. Everyone loved the milk puddings. Two of us liked the baklava and two of us did not - both were great in my opinion. 

All around I thought this was an excellent meal and I'll definitely be back. So a well-played foray into summerlicious for this resto! :)"}
{"text":"Try the calamari, and hummus. I would have hoped for a more full restaurant or if they partitioned off areas to make it look less empty."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on Saturday Aug 23rd. Very good quality restaurant. Portion size was reasonable except the $6.50 fries. Too small for the price. 

Service was semi-slow but we weren't in much of a rush. The open air environment to collage street was nice as well. 

 As the main course with we had the Mixed Meeze and the Beef/Chicken Kabobs. The Mezze was extremely tasty but the Pita was a little tough & a little cool. I found the beef in the shish kabob's was a little fatty & slightly undercooked as well. They gave bottles of water that were passed off as fresh but were out of the tap I saw. 

All-in-all, a solid meal & would go back again."}
{"text":"Big disappointment. I'll start with the pros, the waiters were really nice and professional. 
The food is ok, no more than that. We ordered the two platters, the hummus tasted like store bought, baba ganouj was completely bland not even salt and pepper. And it came with only one pita bread, this place is extremely over priced and portion sizes are as 3 Michelin star restaurant. Literally a teaspoon of hummus, a teaspoon of baba ganouj and labneh with some garnish of supposedly taboulee...sad. so much potential for a beautiful restaurant, defiantly won't go back."}
{"text":"We went on a busy saturday night. Toronto has been experiencing a middle eastern cuisine frenzy of late with a wave of new restaurants opening up in the city. The layout is spacious and there were kids running around our table :) It's a great place to have a family dinner or for large groups to get together. Apparently it was a lucky night for us since toronto star was on premise for an article and photo shoot. They asked our permission and we had no choice but to oblige !

The cocktails were disappointing. Very poorly executed for the price one pays! Avoid them if you can and stick to the food.

Although I should review this place objectively, I feel the food did not pack a punch. The flavors were good but they did not impress me enough to warrant a second visit.
 
They serve complimentary bread but it doesn't come with any dips, so you have no choice but to order a few dips. They also don't have an assortment of dips which means you are stuck with huge portions of a couple of dips at most. The bread itself is boring to eat on its own but we asked for a spicy dip and were offered harissa which made it quite interesting. Actually, we ended up ordering a few rounds of harissa to make the flavors bolder. 

We shared the labneh dip which was modest in every sense of the word. The falafel was good but not mind blowing. Apparently it is made exclusively from chick pea flour which makes it authentic but I found it boring after a few bites. 

The saving grace was the cornish hen with green chili sauce. The skin was crispy and the chicken was moist inside. 

We also shared a few flatbreads - chicken with sumac and harissa pomodoro which were interesting. The addition of harissa made the flavors pop. The bread itself wasn't all that interesting. 

The dessert was a letdown as well. We had a rice pudding which we never finished.

The service was friendly, they also made arrangements to accommodate a few friends who joined us at the last minute."}
{"text":"This tends to be my go to place for larger family gatherings. I've been a number of times where it seemed relatively empty but thankfully seems to be more busy these days. 

I love the food - especially if you share the dishes as you are supposed to. Fresh HOT pita with hummus, and other dips. Lamb is tasty, flatbreads are good. Mix and match"}
{"text":"Not sure I love the vibe of this place. It almost has a clubby feel?  It's a bit overwhelming when the place is not full.
However the food was great. This place has great options for meat eaters and vegetarians. 
The seared cauliflower and eggplant zalouk were really good. The eggplant and lamb burgers were also a hit. I'll definitely be back for the food. Service was also good."}
{"text":"My first time here, the place is amazing, the atmosphere is superb but the food isn't that great. I know Lebanese food inside out and that's not how hommus supposed to taste like. I ordered the Lamb and vegetable Tagine plate, its filling but its tasteless. All I gotta say is the place is overrated, prices are high and the chef is definitely not Lebanese."}
{"text":"Can't understand why this restaurant doesn't have better reviews on yelp--perhaps part of it is due to the confusion over whether it's called District Oven or District Social! The small plates here are all fantastic, the cocktails are inventive, and the service is great and decor appealing. Standouts are the fresh bread, the kefte/kabobs, and pretty much all the mezze. I've been here three times and never been disappointed."}
{"text":"The best food ever! Love the people, environment and food! I'll go there often. It's little bit pricy though which is fine for when you go there time to time!"}
{"text":"My first experience at Summerlicious restaurant!

The food honestly was pretty good, nothing stand out but yummy.

First course had the shrimps and assorted array of dips with a nice hot piece of bread mmmm.

Second course I had the lamb shank dish which came in a pretty big portion. The sauce and the potatoes were a bit sweet, I would've enjoyed it if it were more savory. 

For dessert I had the chocolate gelato, nice and creamy. 

Ordered a mojito and it was very meh. Very flat in flavour, not enough mint or syrup? Too warm? Not sure.

Also the restaurant itself was huge, a really big space - yet it seemed quite empty. They should cozy up the space a bit."}
{"text":"The good:
The interior, ambience, design and layout are beautiful.

The bad:
The food sucks.

The ugly:
See the bad."}
{"text":"The Istanbul \"beer\" (ginger beer and cardamom) was quite delicious, if you like a sweet taste. Points for creativity there!

Service was quite good and ambiance was nice. But the food was quite SALTY! I found there was a reliance on salt more than flavours in the food, or at least, the flavours were overpowered by my need to gulp a glass of water after a few bites.

The flatbreads are essentially pizza... without tomato sauce. Not sure they're particularly unusual or interesting. 

It wasn't bad, exactly, but I wouldn't rush to return."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic experience. I have never tried this type of food before, frankly before we went I had to look up the name of most of the dishes.Thankfully our hosts order a selection of many things on the menu and we enjoyed more of a family style service. Everything was an explosion of fresh meats and vegetables. The freshly baked flat breads with the different vegetable based dips, I could have dined on that alone and so wonderfully presented. I can hardly wait to return with more family and friends to introduce them to this culinary experience."}
{"text":"Came here with a big group. The food was great - we tried falafel, fattoush,  labneh, flatbread, lamb, cauliflower and all were great. Falafel and labneh are must tries!"}
