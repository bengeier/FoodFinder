{"text":"This place is a new business, but they have great food and great prices. Thus far I have not had any bad food. The grilled chicken sandwich is awesome, the chicken pitas are good, the fish looks delicious (my friends ate it, I watched). The service is usually good -- they do not wait the table so you may have to get up and get the girls at the counter to refill your drink. One of the girls seems to have an attitude every day, with no apparent reason. For the most part the female employees are courteous and helpful. If you're looking for a full service place -- they just don't provide it. Otherwise I'd recommend it for good food fast!"}
{"text":"This place is small, don't think much about it riding by. Give it a try everything I've had from here is amazing, burgers, chicken, salads all have been fantastic. I honestly have to make myself not go everyday. Nice people also"}
{"text":"I may have judged North 29 Grill a little too harshly the first time around, but I'm happy to say that I gave this place a second chance and was proven wrong.   Remembering the freshness of the ingredients, but also the lack of seasoning, I was hesitant, yet curious to come by again for lunch with a coworker. North 29 Grill stands as a special place in a sea of fast food restaurants that serve mostly oily, fatty foods, so it is certainly the preferred spot for someone who wants a healthier option.   The menu showcases your typical sandwiches, burgers, and salads, but also gyros and pitas. This time around I chose the grilled chicken sandwich that was only $4, unbelievably cheap considering the size. The portion was MASSIVE. Although, calling it a sandwich is misleading since it's more like a grilled chicken burger.  The chicken patty is INCHES thick and sinfully juicy. Even though I was burning the roof of my mouth with every bite, I could not stop eating it. It was delicious! The vegetables, like lettuce and tomatoes, were fresh while the light mayo sauce didn't overpower the chicken. I will say that the buns did get soggy after some time. Perhaps toasting them would have made this burger even better.  North 29 Grill is simple, from the service to the food, from the flavors to the serving ware. Don't come in expecting anything too well developed or spectacular, but if you're looking for something comforting and familiar, this is the spot for you."}

{"text":"We've eaten here a few times now & always enjoy our food. Good selections. Homemade potato salad & great fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Chicken pita was one of the best ever,  philly steak was very tasty and tea was perfectly made and sweetened. Watch out for fries as they were extremely hot and fresh from the fryer. Would definitely come back."}
