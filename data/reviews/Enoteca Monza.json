{"text":"Bad food, worse service. Skip it.
We went on a quiet weekend when there was plenty of staff and open tables but lack of organization seemed to be rampant. The food really wasn't anything special and the service was terribly slow and not all that friendly. Also, the trays that the pizzas are brought out directly on are thenstored ON THE FLOOR/SIDEWALK once we were done. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"After a long day, a bunch of us went out to eat for a late dinner. We were pressed for time, and we were very happy to see that service is very fast. After being seated quickly, we ordered some drinks and a family sized pizza. Drinks and complementary bread came within minutes, and the pizza came in within ten minutes. Pizza was great. Service was great. 
They even gave us extra bread without us asking. All in all, I really appreciate it the quick and friendly service, and simple, tasty pizza."}
{"text":"As good as it gets that's exactly the thing to say about this restaurant!!!

I came in not knowing exactly what to expect and walked out knowing that I will come back again and again.
The food was so good. We were a group of six people and there was not one dish on the table that we didn't enjoy.
The deserts are pure heaven.
The prices are reasonable and not at all as expensive as I thought they would be. 

They are five stars all the way in my book!!"}
{"text":"This is the standard every restaurant should aspire to. Everything about this place is amazing. From the hostess greeting, professional wait staff, to the most delicious food I have placed in my mouth. This place is a real gem. 

Let's not forget the refreshing sangria or the hot buns. Literally freshly made and brought straight from the oven. 

The only downside is this culinary perfection isn't located in Ontario. But every time I am in Montreal I intend to visit. Every human thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Place is awesome. Great ambiance, amazing food and hot girls. Service is friendly but needs a bit of refinement. Order the eggplants entrée, wow. Sad they took off the gluten free menu."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with family. Had a salad to start which was family sized and a great portion - two salads were great for the eight of us. One of us ordered the olives as well which were so yummy! 
My sister and I shared a marguerita pizza - I had pancetta on one side as I eat meat and she doesn't - and it tasted great. 
The wait staff were friendly, prompt and not overbearing. It was my first time and I would go back again."}
{"text":"Mozza Laval or Mozza West Island, they both have the same in common. Excellent food, excellent service. I frequent the Dollard one more and we never are stuck deciding between restaurants. 
Menu has choices but not too large that you're overwhelmed. 
The pizzas are made to perfection. 
Service is constitant from visit to visit. Well priced.
A must go of you're looking for REAL Italian food."}
{"text":"Enoteca was a great experience. I ordered an italian sausage pizza, which also featured sweet onions and some tasty secondary toppings.

My only criticism would be that it arrived lukewarm, but not so much that is was worth sending back!

Great service, friendly staff. and the dining room looks snazzy, with an open view of the wood-fire pizza oven.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Been going to the 2 other location and I am so happy they open downtown I love the food there the pizza is so good and you would also try the butcher board if you like cheese and cold cuts and there is a great atmosphere on the terrace my favourite thing is the Nutella pizza it's a must !! The service is always good and very friendly"}
{"text":"We saw this restaurant upon our arrival here and decided on checking it out. The service was really good, and the servers were always checking on us. The food came surprisingly fast, which went against all the other reviews that said the service was slow. Don't really understand why this only has two stars and a half, deserves a lot more."}
{"text":"Extremely good food, great service and a very good atmosphere!
Prices are great too especially the family size for pasta dishes is good for 3 people and pretty affordable.
We made reservations before going and the over all services was quick in comparison to the saturday rush hours.
All in all a great place to have delectable food!!"}
{"text":"We were there the last day of our Montreal trip at lunch time. It was a beautiful day, so we decided to sit down outside in the shade.
Their service and food were great, so we were glad we went there.  The potion was good too."}
{"text":"The case for Mozza:

I really don't know why Mozza is getting all this bad rep. It's a staple for myself and just about everyone I know. What I think turns everyone off is the service. For such a big restaurant with so many different components (bar, terrasse, enoteca, indoor seating) there's bound to be some shortcomings. 
The hostesses are ditsy Laval 15 year olds that can't address you properly because they're too busy holding their micro-skirts up or pulling their plunging necklines down. The male waiters are very competent and the menu is not THAT «one trick poney». I would say stay away from the sandwiches and main meals and you're good.

The pizzas are like no other and the pasta is fresh and flavourful. My favorite is the Gladiatore and the gluten free pasta. The butcher's block is 18$ and the amount of cheese alone on that plate cost about that much if not more. It is a great value. I've eaten at too many restaurants in Montreal AND Centropolis to not appreciate a place like Mozza. 

The portions are more than generous and the pizzas are perfectly cooked. If you are a fan of Italian food - NOT fusion Italian but actual simple, fresh Italian food- than you go to Mozza. 16$ for a plate of pasta that size and 15-20$ for a family pizza with fresh toppings, but so fresh you can taste it, is not a very expensive price to pay. I've been to Mozza on as many Saturdays as Tuesdays and the quality of food doesn't change. 

The alcohol and the deserts are pricey but you haven't tasted a nutella calzone like the one you do at Mozza. 

If you're not into restaurant experiences that revolve around the waiter  presenting you with a bottle of sparkling water like it was an aged fine wine...then youll enjoy this place. It's good, fresh food at the best value I've seen in Montreal OR Laval....even if I seem to be the only one who says so on Yelp."}
{"text":"Mozza has fantastic pizza... It's a shame that the customer service doesn't share the same success. Every time I have visited this restaurant, it's been a struggle to a) get the waiter's attention b) get the food on time c) receive any form of customer service whatsoever. 

The chef is doing a brilliant job....let's hope his talent can rub off on management  and his waiter/waitresses."}
{"text":"Delicious, well crafted food, a unique sangria and an unbelievably prompt kitchen. Service can be a bit sluggish when the restaurant is at full capacity, but that's not a huge issue in the delightful Montreal summer."}
{"text":"*NOTE* Although I gave the restaurant a 4, I feel as though it should right in the middle of a 3 and 4. 

I opted for the higher rating here because I was impressed with the food - both main course & dessert. It was a pleasure to dine there. However, a tad overpriced...it's pasta/pizza, not some high end delicacy. Their desserts are quite expensive as well, however I will say that the Apple Cobbler was one of the best I've tried so... DO TRY IT. Service was very friendly and staff made you feel right at home! Ambiance was great and it helps that the restaurant is big...lot's of \"air\"."}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times, and have always been pleased. Exceptionally good for a chain. We're gradually working our way through the menu, and, so far, recommend the spaghetti al funghi e rapini specially, although we've liked everything else we've tried. We go in during the 4:00-7:00 happy hour, and find the house wine and martinis excellent. Prices are reasonable for downtown,and service is attentive (we're in our late 70s, so wait staff notice us among the usual  youthful crowd). We invite out-of-town guests there, and they're happy, too.
The only thing we don't like is the plethora of TV screens tuned to sports channels."}
{"text":"Was in Montreal for business and at the end of a long day I was so happy to find this welcoming restaurant.
Bread was fresh and warm, food came out quickly and hot, dessert was fantastic!
They also accommodated the luggage I had with me without any problem.
Would be happy to dine here again!"}
{"text":"Went for supper last Saturday evening. Hostess told us it would be a 25
min wait to be seated at the terrace. The wait wasn't that long. The hostess was accommodating. However, the service throughout our meal was horrible. The waitress was never to be found. My brother tried complimenting her and she couldn't even say thank you. Perhaps she doesn't understand English that well...? What is up with the awful looking tight dresses the waitresses have to wear? They look so uncomfortable... not very elegant looking. The pizza my brother ordered was burnt... my salad was pretty good. Our entrees (calamari and arancini) were quite good. The sangria did not exactly taste like sangria... 
I would love to go back and try again though and hopefully get a much better waitress."}
{"text":"Giving it four stars. Food and ambience were fantastic. I cannot say enough about the food and the drink. My pasta was great. Salad was great and the restaurant has a great, uptempo vibe. I sat at the bar and the service was ok. Excellent quality. Excellent price."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever very thin crisp with wide variety of toppings  and tasty like the pizzas in Rome , One of the best restaurants with very good quality ingredients ! Must visit to become addict!"}
{"text":"Loved the fact that they have family sizes and regular size items on the menu. And if you plan on taking appetizers, trust me you'll want the smaller version.  Even with the smaller selection, my husband and I left with a doggy bag. The food is pretty good, nothing out of the ordinary but good. Our server was very informative and honest and yes, the girls all have very short dresses so bonus for the guys."}
{"text":"You know what I like about a real Italian restaurant? The commitment to fresh food and basic ingredients.

Unfortunately, from the doe and ingredients for the beloved pizza to the pasta, it is all factory. And we're talking three $$$ resto here people. And what do you expect with such immense menu variety. Always question a large menu. If you have to ask, how do they do it all- don't do it.

If you're Italian or have respect for Italian's don't support this mockery of Italian cusine that preys on poor unknowing suburbans who don't know the difference. They get them with the fancy fire burning oven all-the-time. FYI the oven may be fantastic, but what they're using it for- ain't. On top of it, the one manager I met is smug and will stick up for his poor food- this was the most interesting part of the evening. That night I only remember being dissapointed by the lame pizza (more like dressed-up Dr. Oetker) and the crazy salty veal dish with cream sauce. But the wine tasted like wine... so that was good. Not to mention the free parking in the suburbs. Thank god they sell booze otherwise I would call their expiration at 2 years. Just saying. It's not the food fueling this engine. As for decor... if Baton Rouge was an Italian restaurant... just saying."}
{"text":"I've eaten here regularly when I lived in Laval. Here's the breakdown:

Big place with a great big patio during the summer.

STAFF:
They should just rename it \"Hooters\" snobby girls prancing around with micro mini skirts and push up bras with tops two sizes too small doesn't impress me. Total lack of professionalism.They don't smile nor do they seem to care about doing their jobs very well.
I don't think it's appropriate to look like that when serving the public. Women go there to dine too, not just men so if that is to be the uniform then please make it equal and put some of the waiters in something just as revealing so us women can have eye candy too. 

I had one waitress many times who was always so rude. She spoke only french and while I am bilingual, when I'm spending my money and I'm the customer I want to be served in my language. After I answer her in english she would respond to me in french. That's rude. The least she could have done was go get someone who could speak english to wait on us.

The male waiters are far superior than the women. Emilio is one of my favorite waiters.

FOOD:
Very good. I always loved their pizzas. Only reason I used to go there

DRINKS:
They have quite a nice wine list"}
{"text":"Went w a friend and was told not to order anything unless it was pizza.  Now I understand.

Ordered steak and extremely over cooked and chewy when I asked for medium/rare. Took an hr to get our meals and when I pointed out to the waiter that the steak was Charcoal and nor what I ordered he replied \"what u want me to do\". I asked him if I asked for the right thing would I wait another hr and he told me I would be. 

Didn't like the food. Didn't even get a free drink for the mistake. Waiter was rude. And everything seemed overpriced.

The only upside, the drinks wer good"}
{"text":"I usually rely on Yelp to lead us to outstanding food but I was without cell service so we found this place and figured what the hell (plus it was packed....always a good sign, right?). Well I'm glad we did because the Cesar salad was one of my favorites and the pizza was great. It totally hit the spot. Not sure what all the poopy reviews are all about. It's a solid B."}
{"text":"It's a vey busy place on a cold November night. I was really not impressed. Yes, the thin pizza crust from the wood oven is good, but the ingredients are out of balance: too much arugula on mine, too little mozzarella. Same lack of balance for my 3 friends, It is really average pizza by all means. If you like a busy restaurant, the settings are OK and the service decent, but for the food and price, you can easily get better."}
{"text":"Mozza is a pretty average Italian restaurant located in the sea of restaurants known as Centropolis.  I stopped in on a quiet weeknight with some coworkers and we had simple, decent meals.  The service was friendly, however, it was very dry.  Our waitress didn't have too much personality and almost never smiled.  It's surprising how much of a difference this can make on overall feel of the restaurant.  

The meals were very large which seems to be the norm for most Italian restaurants.  I took half of mine home and had a good meal the next day.  They also had a descent wine selection which we took advantage of.  Overall this is a pretty average Italian restaurant.  If I'm craving Italian again, I'll probably look for a place with better reviews or return to Mozza if I can't find one."}
{"text":"L'endroit est immense et la terrasse est intéressante. Par contre, elle était pleine quand nous sommes arrivés. Nous cherchions un endroit pour manger après une journée passée sur la route pour le boulot. Nous avons eu un excellent service (dommage, je ne me rappelle plus le nom de notre serveuse) et nous avons apprécié la possibilité de partager les pizzas. Ceci dit, il manque pour celles-ci des bougies chauffe-plat ou autre dispositif pour maintenir une certaine chaleur. Les pizzas refroidissent vite et deviennent moins comestibles."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at Mozza. That, to me, is a great start! I'm always willing to give a restaurant a second and third try if the first experience isn't great, but I'm glad to say that I've been to 3 different Mozzas and they've all been equally good (consistency is key!) and I love the ambiance of this one in particular. 

Went here for lunch yesterday, probably my 10th visit to this particular restaurant, and ordered the Siciliana pizza with an additional topping of crumbled Italian sausage. It has thick, fat, salty, juicy Tuscan olives on it that were to die for, and the sausage (extra $4) really made the pizza that much better (IMHO). 

My go-to pizza is usually the Rucola (an insane amount of arugula and some prosciutto & cheese), but I wanted to mix it up yesterday. My friend ordered the Nonno Angelo, which had anchovies on it (soooo not my thing!) and he ate the whole pizza up in like 5 minutes. He loved it! 

In the past, I've enjoyed the arancini to start, but yesterday I tried the parmigiano French fries cause I wanted something small. They were yummy, but stick to the regular appetizer list for an appie when you order. I've tried most of them and they've all been good. 

One awesome thing is they now have Moretti beer on tap!! Woot woot! Bottoms up!"}
{"text":"Beaucoup de potentiel: bonne sauce tomate, excellente pâte à pizza au four à bois, mais tout manque de fini. L'endroit se veut typiquement italien, mais croyez-moi, pour connaître assez bien l'Italie, la vraie, ainsi que les vrais bons restos italiens de Laval et Montreal, je crois que Mozza est un peu \"imposteur\" et trop commercial en la matière. Le \"proscuitto cotto\" sur ma pizza n'était que du vulgaire jambon fumé, les copeaux de \"parmesan\" étaient un fromage semblable, mais au goût et à la qualité moindre, et le biscotti servi avec mon café était... une insulte au biscotti! C'est tellement simple et pas tellement plus cher de servir des ingrédients authentiques et de qualité. Ça n'avait pas mauvais goût, mais ce n'était pas incroyable non plus.  
Autrement, le service était bien, sans plus. Atmosphère agréable par contre, genre de \"grande place bruyante trendy\" si on aime le style...
Si votre but n'est pas de faire de la grande gastronomie et de passer un agréable moment en couple, en famille ou entre amis, c'est probablement un bon endroit. Il semble que l'endroit soit bien organisé pour les enfants (service, menu enfants, jeux, dessins) et je préfèrerait de loin aller chez Mozza que chez Mikes ou St-Hubert avec des enfants. J'ai également déjà visité l'endroit en été et la terrasse était très agréable, probablement une des plus intéressantes du Centropolis selon mes expériences."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The terrace is big ! The restaurant gets very crowded during lunch time
so i suggest u go around 11:30 to have fast sevice and a place"}
{"text":"Went there with my family... the food was nice and tasty... I can't say that it is the best Italian I've ever had but it is one of top ones. We were four people and two kids, everyone order something different; Pasta with Chicken, veal, shrimps, grilled salmon, salad and calamari. Everyone loved their food 

The reason I am giving this place a 4-star rating is because not only we enjoyed our food, the service was really good. The place was full, almost every table had people sitting, yet the service was quick and friendly. I even saw a supervisor, a manager or an owner (because he was wearing a different outfit) helping out seating people, giving tables and simply being involved. 

Our overall experience was great, and not a lot of places have that. Either you get good food with a horrible service or the other way around. 

We sat outside and the area is simply warm and beautiful. We went inside to have a look and it was also full, and the place looked really nice. 
I would highly recommend this place to anyone celebrating a birthday or a special occasion. Romantic dinner or simply hanging out on a date night with your love. This is a nice place to go to and I would definitely go there again. 

You try it and you be the judge !!!"}
{"text":"I can get skeptical when it comes to going out for lunch or supper at a chain type restaurant but my colleagues reserved a table here for lunch a few days ago so I thought what the heck. 

Turns out the food was actually a lot better than what I was expecting, or maybe I was just really HUNGRY by the time my food made it's way to me! 

The horrible service is the reason this experience was a bad one. We were a table of 8 and two of us ordered before everyone else and specified to the waitress that we were going to dine and head out before the rest of the group because we had a meeting right after lunch. We still had an hour ahead of us so we were not too stressed. The rest of our table ordered about 15 minutes after us, yet all 6 of them were served almost right away. The waitress was rude and kept telling us it \"wasn't her fault\" instead of just apologizing for the wait.

We waited for 40 minutes longer and by that time everyone had finished their plates and had to sit there waiting for us. At this point, the waitress just tried to avoid us so as not to have to come check up on us and reassure us. Still not quite sure how it took over an hour to make 2 pizzas after they made an error with our order.

The least we would have expected was for a manager or someone to come apologize and offer us our meals, but since that never happened we just grabbed our food when it was finally ready and left the restaurant."}
{"text":"Five of us recently for dinner while on a trip to Montreal.

I ordered a pizza Carnivora which was pretty good. Two from the group ordered pasta dishes which they enjoyed greatly. And two shared the butcher's board which they enjoyed.

Several glasses of wine and a couple beers which were also good.

Service was really fast and friendly. The food arrived faster than expected.

Only odd thing about the experience was the bread and dipping oil at the start.... the oil was super spicy and hot which is odd for an Italian themed restaurant."}
{"text":"It can get quite busy, I recommend coming earlier to avoid lineups!

I came here a few times, and the food is always excellent! My favorite is the Tortellini Rosée. The pizza is also very good."}
{"text":"À éviter le midi. J'ai aimé leur pizza. J'aime l'ambiance, mais il y a un sérieux problème au niveau du service. Plusieurs personnes que je connais ont eu des problèmes de service. Dans notre cas, la 2e fois que j'y suis allé, ils nous ont oublié, nous avons attendu près de 1h, malgré que la serveuse nous disait que ca s'en venait. Nous avons eu nos breuvages gratuits, mais ce n'était pas excusable.

Ils savent qu'ils ont une clientèle plus pressée le midi et ne peuvent négliger le service.

Lors de notre première visite, nous n'avons pas eu de problèmes, mais mes collègues qui avaient réservé une table ont attendu très longtemps avant d'avoir leur table. 

La 3e fois était un dimanche, alors il n'y a pas eu de problème au niveau du service et j'ai apprécié l'expérience. 

Au final, on oublie que la pizza est malgré tout bonne. Les portions sont généreuses. Les entrées sont intéressantes et les salades sont un choix intéressant à partager. Le format de pizza familial permet également de partager et d'avoir un repas convivial entre amis. La liste de vins est intéressante également. 

J'y retournerai en soirée ou le week-end, mais personne ne veut y retourner un midi."}
{"text":"Another walk-in gone wrong. This is what happens when you're strolling looking for something to eat with no wifi and no access to yelp, you end up in a mediocre place like this one with horrendous service all because their umbrellas are pretty and their outdoor seating looked cool. 

The service was crap. Our waitress had a funky attitude the whole time like we were inconveniencing her by eating there. Maybe she was upset because they make them wear these cheap black dresses that look like my niece sewed it together. The men were dressed fine (black button down, black slacks) yet the women all looked cheap. Sexist owner perhaps?

Drinks were super weak and the bruschetta appetizer had olives, which gave it a weird taste."}
{"text":"I hate to say this but the service is terrible.
They made a mistake with our order they offered to get us a side , we said yes.... They charged us for the side ...

The waiter also was very obnoxious and dismissive.

Will never go there again"}
{"text":"The pizza crust was made this morning or yesterday. When you order the pizza they put the toppings on and then re-heat. The pasta dishes are equally unappetizing. The decor is otherwise nice and the wait staff all wear the the spandex crotch length dresses which appear to be the required uniform for female wait staff in many of the Montreal chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Why didn't I order spaghetti with meatballs?  Watching other plates go by I figured out what to order a little too late.

This is a Cheesecake Factory of Canada.  Food is mild, drinks are light.  They pump house music but families bring their kids.  Seating is great for large groups.  Bathrooms are upstairs which is a little weird.

Food fires out of the kitchen very fast.  They could teach Olive Garden how to do a better job.  But OG tastes better.  

There are raw red onions in the bruschetta even though it's not written in the menu.  The spaghetti pomodoro is bland unless you add chicken or something else.  The lasagna doesn't look how it's described but tastes really good.

From the Yelp listing I thought it would be more intimate for a nice date but it's really an eat and run type place.  From the outside it looks way cooler than the experience."}
{"text":"I'm from New York, so pizza is my middle name. This place is pretty good for Montreal. The pizzas and their toppings are well constructed which is key, creating a good texture. However, what establishments beyond New York always fail to execute correctly on is the crust. Crust here was a bit soft/floppy, not crisp, so it was a bit disappointing. However, the salads were good, other appetizers were good, and like I said- pizza was good enough. Service was a bit slow, but it was early afternoon.

Restaurant has a very modern atmosphere that somehow still captures the coziness of Montreal - I found the space very appealing."}
{"text":"This place is my home base for Friday lunch with coworkers... But my son also loves their pizzas and I sometime end-up caving in and going a second time on Friday night just for that :-)

Food is good, quickly served and always equal.  Service is fantastic at lunch time, but I find that when I have dinner on the outside terrace, it's not always that great.

That being said, I'm always going back."}
{"text":"Nous avons voulu réserver une vingtaine de place pour un souper de Noël de bureau. Le gérant, pas très compréhensif, voulais nous obliger à prendre des repas 3 services. Après avoir tenté de négocier avec lui en lui mentionnant que quelques personnes souhaiteraient ne prendre qu'un plat principal en raison de contraintes alimentaires, il nous a clairement dit que ça ne fonctionnerait pas, parce qu'en ayant des gens qui ne consomment pas beaucoup de nourriture, et qui s'éternisent à cause d'un souper de Noël « il ne ferait pas d'argent ». C'était pourtant un souper de Noël, ce qui signifie plusieurs ventes d'alcool, ce qui est très payant pour un restaurant. Nous avons eu beaucoup de difficulté à communiquer avec le gérant, que ce soit par courriel ou par téléphone. Mauvaise gestion. Je comprends maintenant pourquoi les critiques sont aussi mauvaises côté service..."}
{"text":"The wood oven pizza here is AWESOME! 
The pasta here SUCKS!

My GF ordered a pizza and it was Delish, great wood oven pizza in the heart of MTL.

I ordered the meat sauce and spaghetti and it was so bland and nasty. Very disappointed.

This place has a patio right on McGill college in the heart of MTL. Would recommend, just stay away from ordering the pastas and stick with the pizza and you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Stopped here during a hockey tournament what a find this was.  Being from philly we have a pizza joint on every corner and it can range from awesome to awful.  This place was great   good service.   Great pizza and anytime you can have a cold beer with a hot pizza you have 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Pretty good pasta and pizza, family size of each was more than enough food for four adults. 

The meatballs were a must have."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night and it was a full house. You know a restaurant is run well when despite that, you have a great experience from beginning to end. We had a reservation which I would recommend you make during their busy weekend evenings, we were seated right away and had great quick and attentive service. 

My go to order is the hazel salad and margherita pizza, it never disappoints! Their desserts also hit the spot. For a table of 4 we opted to split 2 desserts; the Cookie Monster and the Nutella Calzone. Both were realllllly good, in fact I am drooling right now remembering them. I find the dessert portions quite large so I would suggest splitting desserts especially after a carb heavy meal."}
{"text":"Bon resto bien situé. J'aime particulièrement la terrasse en été. La pizza est excellente mais je déconseille les pâtes. Elles ne sont pas fraîches et manquent d'inspiration. La sauce n'est pas maison (selon la serveuse) et les boulettes sont comme du caoutchouc avec une texture pré-mâchée. À éviter! Surtout lorsqu'on compare avec la pizza."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous posts that it is ordinary, but I seem to go back here often so the food must be descent. Haven't had anything else in the Centropolis I would go back to."}
{"text":"My wife and I sat outside and dined at Enoteca Mozza last night. I ordered a pizza with anchovies, Caramelized onions and roasted peppers. It was cooked perfectly with an extremely thin crust. My wife ordered the salad or arugula, hazelnuts, goat cheese, Caramelized pears and a lemony vingrette dressing.  We each had a Negroni for a cocktail which was very good. The food was very good as was the service and setting. I wouldn't hesitate to go back here."}
{"text":"I went to this place for lunch with my friend one afternoon. Their lunch menu looked delish and their soup of the day was my favourite Cauliflower and Prosciutto :) I had the veal Scaloppini and a side of garlic noodles. Both were yummy on their own but a bit of a strange mix together but that was my bad for caving and ordering garlic noodles. The place was decorated like a fancy restaurant but with giant TVs everywhere which seemed a bit strange and out of place. The waitresses all seemed to be wearing the same dress which was also a bit odd because it definitely didn't suit everyone meanwhile the waiters seemed to be able to wear what they wanted... Not so cool. The place was huge with an upstairs and downstairs and is definitely capable of having large groups. The food came really fast and our waitress was really nice and helped us out with deciding what to order. We didn't have time for dessert but would definitely like to return to try because they looked awesome. If you are craving Italian cuisine this is definitely a good place to visit for not too expensive, lots of options and a nice atmosphere. :)"}
{"text":"Food is great here (their hazelnut salad and salmon in particular) however the service has gone downhill. The past three times I have been the service keeps getting worst and worst. The first time we waited 30 minutes for a table despite having a reservation and showing up on time. The second time the server was very inattentive and non present. This last time we went for a late work lunch. The server hardly came by the table, service was very slow and then he made several errors on the bill. When I brought this to the manager's attention he apologized but did not do anything to correct our bill. He lost my business."}
{"text":"Solid pizza. Delicious wood oven pizza pie. Went with the kids, the loved it. Good drinks too. Many GF options, wifey is a celiac so that good for us. Service was good and everyone was very polite Nd effective.We will 100% be back."}
{"text":"The food is fine for lunch but the wait is sooo long, it seems like every time it takes 90 min to to finish without coffee and dessert. Granted it's better then the previous restaurant that was there. Portions is sizeable, I enjoyed the Italian sausage lasagna but for business lunch it's just too long"}
{"text":"By mistake the taxi driver took us there for pizza. The server was very help full, friendly . We ordered three different pizza, veggie, spinach, arugula with bruschetta .All of them great crust & great taste . Love the bread they serve . Love the bear the server recommend.we all are very happy to find this place."}
{"text":"Business supper for 3. Crowded terrasse on a warm evening. My colleagues ordered the two types of salmons and really enjoyed themselves. Sides were fries grilled veggies or pasta. I had the veal. It was breaded and fried. Kinda thin and dry. I was hoping a little more moist. They missed serving us bread and it took a while to give our order. Mixed crowd. The pizzas looked great and so did the pasta dishes."}
{"text":"My favourite Italian restaurant on the west island. Large portions, great atmosphere and exceptional service. Great for takeout too!"}
{"text":"U go for their terrasse not the food. Very overprice for the quality, i tried many of their pasta and its honestly blend.. but u pay for the spot and the ambiance."}
{"text":"They have a good variety on the menu, from oven wood oven baked pizza's to Osso Bucco.  Try the Mamma meatball slider to start!  Went on a saturday night, it was busy, so i can get noisy."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. 
The decor is nice but the chairs were not comfortable. 
The pizza was good but for some reason we ordered 2 as we were a big group and both pizzas arrive at our table cold. It was disappointing."}
{"text":"I came here on a date last month. My girlfriend was a bit annoyed that they sat us in the bar section even though she had reserved a week in advance, but the place was full and she was too hungry to wait. 

We shared the Tortellini with rosé sauce and their Calabrese Pizza (with added spicy oil) and it was delicious. They have a large selection of wine and cocktails to choose from. 

The only problem I had, and this has nothing to do with the restaurant, is the waitress commenting on the fact that my girlfriend picked up the check.

I would definitely go back. It was delicious, cheap and did I mention they have Pizza?"}
{"text":"My colleague's and mine pastas were good. The fresh breadsticks were good, and our server was good.

One minor gripe though: when we were ready to order, my waitress was nowhere to be found for a few minutes (I later found out she was getting wine for a table next to us). I had my hand up for quite some time and both the hostess and another server saw me and made eye contact, but promptly ignored me. A busboy later came and told me he'd get our waitress just as she came out with the wine.

I know we weren't the responsibility of the hostess or another waiter, but I think it'd be good etiquette to at least acknowledge the patron instead of leaving him continuously trying to wave someone down, isn't it?"}
{"text":"Bad customer service and bad pasta!

I came here with three of my friends.
I had one of the rosé pasta, as well as the calamari to start. I was very full from the calamari, so I only had a few bites of my pasta and asked for the rest to go. The pasta was below average, very oily and salty. Calamari was ok.

When I got home, I decided to finish my leftovers only to notice they gave me SOMEONE ELSE'S leftovers! I call them and they told me to come in to get money refunded. I came in and the manager (Aleksander) said he can't refund me, but can give me a gift card through email. I contacted him several times with no replies.

Don't waste your time with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food, inexpensive prices. Pretty decent amount of different Italian foods that should satisfy most tastes. The restaurant is a little on the noisy side however if you are willing to see past that and have a family, I suggest trying it out. With most (if not all) pasta dishes, you can opt for the 'family size' which is a great way of cutting costs and sharing a meal. Pizza's are gigantic too (made in their wood burning stove). 
Not quite on the same level as some places you would find in Little Italy, but for a chain restaurant, it is certainly worthy of 3 stars."}
{"text":"I hate to come across as a food snob but I just can't wrap my head around Mozza. The food isn't really *that* bad but at the same time it isn't *that * good either.  

I've been to Mozza Laval 3 times and the one thing that really sticks out in my mind from the three visits is the lack of service. I hate when I have to chase down a waiter/waitress or they don't come around the table that often. What I especially hate is when the wait staff comes around the table and hears that the ENTIRE table is speaking ENGLISH yet she speaks French. It's one of my pet peeves. You obviously hear us talking, ask us what we'd like to eat in ENGLISH!

Tonight, I wasn't that hungry so I decided on a salad. I was really debating between two different salads so I was doing a check list of what was on the salad that I like vs what I don't like. My favorite vegetable is cucumber but my favorite green is arugula, however these two weren't on any salad together. When the waitress came by I asked her (in English) for the arugula salad but to omit the onion and please add cucumber. She told me, \"We don't have cucumber\". So I kindly point out that they in fact do have cucumber as its one of the main ingredients on their other salad. She replies with \"I don't know if my chef will do that\". Listen lady, your chef isn't making my salad okay? It's a line cook...and since I'm paying for my salad and I'm asking for the cucumber put it on there. It's not like I asked them to add some crazy unheard of wild ingredient that they have to fly to Brazil for....

After a while the food comes and salad is made the way I want it to be made so I was happy with that. I wasn't happy with the waitresses attitude about it though. The salad wasn't anything to write home about, I think I make a better salad at home (my sweet balsamic dressing is more flavorful).  While we were eating the waitress came to ask us something (in french) so I have no idea. She could have told me to go fly a kite and I'd be like \"no merci\". 

I have to say, my best experience at Mozza was good (minus the service) but I had a pizza which was super flavorful and huge. There were left overs that tasted great. We also had seating near the pizza oven so we got to watch them make the pizza fresh. A poster below me mentioned that Mozza is a one trick pony and the truth is.... IT IS. Any thing other than a pizza and its mediocre at best.

If Mozza wants to stay afloat for longer than a few years I would definitely work on finding better staff. Staff who like their job or are good at pretending to like their job. A little service goes a long way and if I'm going to spend my money in your venue, please show me you appreciate it."}
{"text":"Decent place for a drink and a bite to eat with good atmosphere and a decent wine list. A traditional pizza oven makes this a perfect pizza parlour, and their pasta is always fresh"}
{"text":"A colleague invited us for lunch, so I was excited to try it at first. 

Our workplace is very strict, and we only have one hour for lunch, absolutely not a minute more, and since our office is right next to this place and my colleague had been here before, we knew it was entirely doable. 

See, the problem is that we had a reservation for 3. When we arrived, we were told the table was being cleaned and that we would be seated shortly. Then a couple minutes later, the two hostesses started seating other groups of 3 without reservations. Since when are reservations not seated first? 

Oh, we were the last unseated reservation, by the way. I could see it on their screen, which also clearly displayed we were already 15 minutes behind. 

15 minutes is not much unless you have, you know, 60 minutes total for lunch. 

Soup of the day (zucchini cream I think) was good, pizza was alright, caesar salad was rather bland. Place is loud, service is non-existent. 

The 15-minute wait for a reservation, when we arrived precisely on time, is a complete lack of respect and shows that staff is poorly managed."}
{"text":"Came here on friday night for a work dinner with a group of about 15 people. Started with their sangria which was very refreshing and flavourful. We all shared calamari and the charcuterie platter. The calamari was nice and crispy, not overcooked. The platter was alright, nothing crazy, the best part of it was the cheese. Also got an order of bruschetta, which was OK, the bread was a bit too toasted for my liking. The service was great, the waiters were polite and knew what they were doing. Overall, it was a good experience and will be going back."}
{"text":"The Yelp reviews for this place are kinda confusing, with ratings on both ends of the extreme, so I came in with a lot of skepticism that perhaps made me extra critical of the food. Overall, I thought this was an okay option, with average food, but service was surprisingly quick. 

We got seated right away, despite the restaurant being pretty full, so that was a relief as I was worried we wouldn't find a place nearby to eat at on a busy Thursday night. There's seating outside and inside, and the place was pretty big, with a lively vibe albeit a little loud. Service was adequate - put in our orders promptly and it came out quickly.

Food wise, we got started off with a bread basket, which is actually the best part of the meal. It was warm and soft, and pretty yummy. We got the large chefs board, family portion pizza, family portion pasta and a chicken main. WAY TOO MUCH FOOD for five people - the family portions are huge. The chefs board was pretty good, with a variety of meats, cheeses and toasted bread.The grilled chicken breast had a nice herby flavor and the vegetable side (grilled zucchini, red and yellow peppers and asparagus) was pretty good. The pasta was very average - we got basic one with the tomato sauce; since it was in a hugeeee bowl the spaghetti at the bottom was pretty dry.  I was pretty disappointed by the pizza - it was not the charred, crispy bottom I was promised and was actually quite soggy. 

Overall, not a bad meal but nothing too memorable. A reasonably priced option though with generous portions."}
{"text":"Exactly what it looks like :  The best possible people watching vantage point in the heart of downtown Montreal 

Excellent service, great wine list.  Have the Caprese Tower:  crazy generous portion of bocconcini.  Took the photo after I felled the tower"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place for lunchtime if you can't stay longer than an hour.  Otherwise it was very good.  When it's busy don't expect fast service though. The food itself was very good. Had a steak and cheese panini with side of salad. Would definitely have it again.  My friends each had a pizza. They enjoyed them very much. Meal size is great.  Conclusion, not a place if you have limited time but the food is good."}
{"text":"Went here for friend's birthday. We were a group of 16, and we waited for our bill almost 40 mins. To be honest, the service at Monza needs to be improved.  Bathroom wasn't clean at all."}
{"text":"Background
Came here for a business lunch.  

Food 4/5
I ordered the spinach and goat cheese pizza.  The pizza was thin and crispy and there was an abundance of spinach.  I like pizzas with a small amount of tomato sauce and this was just perfect.  A little more goat cheese would have been better.

Service 3/5
The server was ok.  He wasn't really helpful with the dish types and didn't really recommend anything.  The food came out fast.

Ambiance 4/5
The focal point is Italian pizzeria brick oven inside.  Plenty of seating, high ceiling and open space."}
{"text":"Very good, had a lasagna and a tortellini as well as the chef's cutting board appetiser, and 2 drinks.  A simple white wine and a spiced rum and coke.  Portions were very large, even for me, but for the price very reasonable.  Very busy on a Saturday night, and staff seemed a little over whelmed. Good experience over all."}
{"text":"Muy buen Restaurant, con un excelente servicio y buena relación entre el  precio y el valor. Buena presentación de los platos."}
{"text":"In the great tradition of giant Suburbian restaurants serving up generic food, Mozza archives in failing to inspire!

Although I did enjoy my pizza, everything else on the table was real ordinary. 

The service was a real zero. I hate chasing the waiter for water. You know the type of waiter I'm talking about, he purposely walks around with tunnel vision, ignoring customers trying to get his attention. Waiting times were generally slow."}
{"text":"Great restaurant located in the heart of the downtown core. The service was excellent, food was top-notch, and they have an enticing assortment of cocktails/wine. The atmosphere is also all-inclusive as it's perfect for parties, a night out on the town, or catching a game. Would definitely recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Bon restaurant italien. La cuisine est savoureuse, ils servent une excellente pizza au four à bois. J'ai pris des olives en entrée et une pizza aux artichauts et olives. Excellente. 

L'ambiance est agréable malgré que la musique est un peu forte. Avec un Resto plein le bruit est élevé. Sinon le service est courtois et assez rapide."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on Friday with a small group, we all started with the sangria to share, it was full of fruity flavor and refreshing - the way a sangria should be. The presentation was also very nice which always adds a positive feel to the experience. I was also impressed on the choice of wine , and the knowledge that the service staff had on the wine list. For main meal I decided with another person in my group to try 2 different pizzas. The Calabrese was amazing, do not take this if you don't like spicy though as the hot peppers definitely had effect but did not take away from the flavor and texture of the Italian sausage. We also tried the Capricciosa, this one was amazing, the prosciutto gave a nice sweet taste to the pizza which compensated the spiciness of the other one. The individual pizzas are a decent size for sharing if you want to expand your taste horizons to share and try different types. The staff was very professional and friendly making this a great first experience overall."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this place because we had went by earlier in the day and had noticed that it was quite busy. We got taken in right away without a reservation which was nice. They have seating in both the patio and inside (I recommend sitting inside because they have the chairs packed so closely together that I kept getting bumped by the waiters and other customers). The service was not all that great, we barely saw our waiter and he seemed to be in some other world. Since he hadn't showed up for awhile I decided to ask the host for a straw she said \"your waiter will give you one\", and walked away. I found that pretty rude, getting a straw should have been a minor inconvenience to her. 

Anyway, I got the Orecchiette Pesto and my fiancée had the Mozza Club. Both were amazing and so flavourful! If it weren't for the bad service it would have gotten a much better review as the food really was something to rave about :)"}
{"text":"I read some reviews complained about the bad service.  However, we all had good experience and received very friendly and warm service for our first visit here.  Our lovely server took good care of all our orders.  The kids were given small boxes of new crayons and papers once they sat down.

Since there was no space for setting up a table for 6 at the patio, we were arranged to just sit inside.  The inside of the restaurant is very spacious with very high ceiling.  The bar area is chic and huge.  Washrooms are located upstairs and there is a smaller dinning area on the balcony level.

The food we ordered are all above average except the pasta with cream sauce.  It was way too creamy to my taste (maybe that's the reason I totally forgot to take a photo of the pasta?!).  I especially love their mozzarella Mac & Cheese and the Ripieno Panini (fire grilled beef panini). They were just so yummy.

A total kids friendly restaurant and price is reasonable."}
{"text":"If you love authentic Italian food but in an American-Italian style, you'll love this place! They have great appetizers starting from the fresh soup of the day to the \"Butcher's board\", which includes prosciutto, cacciatore, salami, speck, parmigiano, provolone, cippolini & crostini, all served on one cutting board easy to share with your friends! Great salad! If you're a shrimp lover, you should definitely try the \"Mediterraneo\" salad. Not only do they serve salads, they have a variety of pasta and their thin crust pizza cooked in their wood-fired stone oven! Finish off your meal with a glass of Val di Suga red wine and their dessert! Excellent food, and a quick & excellent service. And not too pricey."}
{"text":"Nice slick ambience in an upscale suburban complex. But the food was nothing special. The Pepperoni pizza was good with nice crispy pieces of pepperoni. The margherita pizza seemed more like a regular cheese pizza in appearance and taste. It was OK as a cheese pizza but terrible if it was supposed to be a marghertia pizza. Service was decent and polite. 

A pretty safe choice as long as you avoid the margherita."}
{"text":"Only giving it 4 stars cuz i didnt try the food yet but service and quality of red wine are amazing i highly recommend this place, very nice ambiance, very chic type place but can still show up in jeans without feeling like a bum! Cant wait to try the food! Definitely coming back, Olivia our barmade was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Very ordinary food and way too pricy. Service was super duper slow. We order pizza/pasta and flourless chocolate cake for desert. None of the dishes had much flavor to them. This is the first time I actually sprinkled salt on my pizza. Outdoor seating was nice though for a warm summer evening."}
{"text":"Having supper with a friend who I hadn't seen in a while at Enoteca Monza.  We started with the butcher's board and crostini bruschetta which were really fresh and tasty.  We then had the rucola pizza and the penne Gigi.  The prosciutot, mozzarella,  and the arrugula were fresh and the pizza dough wasn't over cooked so it was both crispy and soft.  As for the penne Gigi it was perfect.  Just the right balance of cream an tomato sauce and the pancetta wasn't over cooked.   Over all it was a spectacular meal"}
{"text":"Simple restaurant in the centropolis area in Laval,  i went there for lunch, they have a very big  terrace. It was completely full on this sunny day. On most of the tables you can see Pizzas it seems to be the most popular meal, they have individual and family sizes. The variety is big and the crist is thin. I decided to go for a pasta plate, penne with sausages and rapinis. On the menu you will also find veal and chicken piccatas, salmon and a few salads."}
{"text":"After coming to this restaurant and checking out the reviews, I'm actually quite shock about the one star ratings. 

In all fairness, I can't say much about the restaurant as my group was only here for dessert and drinks. We needed a place to sit after a long walk in Montreal. We sat by the patio in the sun which was quite refreshing and what we needed. However I do feel it deserves more than one star. The dessert and drinks were A-ok. 

In terms of the service, we had a lovely waitress in terms of friendliness. I'm not going to say who she was but she was a bit scatter brain when it came to taking our orders. When she found out we were only ordering dessert and drinks, she took away all our utensils and cloth napkins causing us to have no serviettes. It was a bit awkward but later we just had to ask for it again. Also a few of us wanted non-alcoholic drinks and she completely mixed up the alcohol and non-alcohol drinks which is potentially dangerous if you ask me. My friend definitely did not have alcohol in her drink when she requested it. At least there wasn't alcohol in the drink when I requested non-alcohol."}
{"text":"Love the bar section of this resto. The wine selection is terrific, the wait staff is adorable (do they have to try on those little black outfits to get the job?) And knows what to recommend and food comes quickly if you are on lunch for business."}
{"text":"Nonna would be proud of Mozza. 

The food here is casual Italian dining with an influence on good family food in a upbeat and chic decor.

Their pizzas are great. Being made in a wood burning stove they have a nice 'rustic' feel to them. If your not sure what to order - go with the Calabrese.

I ordered the Caesar salad with veal parmigiana.  The salad was a nice size portion as an app. Great fresh taste and not too heavy on the dressing as you sometimes get with other places. 

The Veal Parmigiana is excellent. Nicely breaded and accompanied by either your choice of spaghetti Pomodoro or sea-salted Parmigiano fries - again, go with the spaghetti!

If after all this you still have room for dessert - then don't bother looking at the menu: Go for the COOKIE MONSTER. This soft chocolate chip cookie  is served to you a la mode in a warm cast iron pan ready to be enjoyed.

They also have specials on Wednesday and Thursday nights.  Make sure you check those out!"}
{"text":"Fancy place, horrible food. The food came in my plate in less than 5 minutes. Everything seems to be microwable. Definetely is not a place i will ever go back. My girlfriend ordered a salad and it also was disgusting."}
{"text":"IMPORTANT TIP: Go on a Sunday evening!
We had no clue what to expect because the outside of the restaurant seemed very fancy. 
I recommend dressing up (at least a little, so you don't feel undressed). 

Okay back to my tip!
On Sundays, you can get a family-sized portion of the pizza, pasta or salad for the price of an individual size!! 

We ordered a family sized-pizza (the Spinaci!!) which includes 8 large slices for a mere $16 dollars. 

With this discount, we were each able to enjoy a nice glass of wine from the large selection of wines they offered. 

This restaurant is definitely more of a family-style place, but it's great for couples too!"}
{"text":"We were a group of 4 and tried Mozza on a Saturday night. Luckily we had made reservations because the place was packed! So right out of the gate we were seated but quickly noticed that the hostess showed us to the table put down 4 menus and walked away. I found that a little weird and cold. She should of introduced us to our waiter and wish us a good meal, but I guess she was not well trained! Waiter showed up after a long period of time, he excused himself for the delay and we ordered drinks and our food. It came out at a reasonable time. The calamari I would of preferred more crispy but well seasoned. The sausage and rapini cooked to point. The Mac and cheese well seasoned, but the best app in my opinion were the arancini, just delicious everything was good about them. After we ordered a family size pizza. Over all well seasoned and prepared just would of liked it hotter and more crisp. For dessert nata and big chocolate chip cookie with ice cream. Simple but well presented and tasty. Over all they should work on their service but a good experience over all. Will return!"}
{"text":"I went to Mozza Pizzeria on McGill College Avenue as part of an after work event with some co-workers.

According to my bill, the waitress was Jacinthe.

I felt that service was extremely slow. I'm not sure if this is usual since it was my first time there but we were seated at about 5:00pm and we weren't asked about our drink orders until about 5:30pm. Drinks came about 5:45pm and then they finally asked us about our food order at about 6:10pm. By then, some people in our group paid for their drink and left since even though they were going to eat, they couldn't stay that long so they had a piece of bread that we were each given at the table when the beer arrived.

This didn't really bother me but the menu was entirely in French with no English translations (i.e. not a bilingual menu). One of my co-workers who didn't speak French at all asked me if I knew what émiettée (as applied to Italian sausage) meant and I told him that I didn't know the exact translation but I told him that it was like pieces of meat or hash or bits of meat... in this case Italian sausage (as opposed to slices of Italian sausage). I ordered one of their pizzas (Salsiccia) which I thought was very good. The pizza arrived at around 6:30pm.

I ordered 2 drinks. Both beers were on special as part of their 4a7 promotion. The first drink I ordered came in a tall glass (Coors Light 20oz) which had a Coors Light label on the glass. When I finished it and my pizza arrived, I decided to order another drink so I ordered a Molson Ex but neglected to specify the size. It came in a a different size/shape glass. I remembered one of my colleagues having ordered the Molson Ex and the glass came in the same size glass as my Coors Light (but had a Molson Ex label on the glass). I didn't think much about it since I didn't specify the size of my Molson Ex unlike when I ordered my first beer (Coors Light) which I specifically mentioned the 20oz. I assumed that Jacinthe thought that I wanted the smaller size one... which I didn't really care or have a preference on.

When I needed to leave, I asked for my bill and noticed that I was charged for two 20oz beers (on special). I mentioned to Jacinthe that the 2nd beer I had was in a different size glass but she didn't believe me. She then mentioned that I got a discount for both beers as part of the 4a7 hours which I was never disputing and I did see on my bill. I repeated that my second beer was in a different size and what I am sure was a smaller glass when compared to my first beer. She insisted that I had 20oz both times. Since the bus boy had taken both my drink glasses and my pizza plate from my table, there was no way to prove that I had gotten 2 different sized glasses with the 2nd beer (Molson Ex) being different from the glass that my co-worker got who ordered a 20oz Molson Ex (which was in the same size/glass as my Coor's Light). I didn't want to argue since most of my co-workers were still having drinks and eating.

I was thinking of reducing my tip by the difference in the price between the two size beers ($2) but since most of the people from my party were still there and might order some other stuff, I didn't want any problems to occur with their food/drinks if they were to order something after I left as I've heard is often done by disgruntled employees at some restaurants.

The food was very good. Service was very slow in my opinion. Also, I didn't like what happened with being overcharged for my second beer. If the food wasn't as good as it was, I would have probably given a 1 star rating instead of 2 star."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Ordered the pesto pasta and swapped the ear pasta for tagliatelle. Split an individual size with my friend and it ended up just being the perfect amount. We were also served fresh hot bread with butter(!!). However, the place is a bit cold (figuratively and literally, with the a/c blasting in the summer) and it doesn't have much of a welcoming atmosphere. Waiters seem uninvested in their jobs and there are tons of big TVs everywhere that distract from the conversation and food. My dish only cost 12$ with tip since I split it with my friend. But the prices here are very upscale.. don't expect to get out of there without spending at least 35$ per person..."}
{"text":"The service was not very good since the restaurant  was so busy but when the manager understand he was so nice and he behave so good that made us happy at the end of the day ! Plus the most important thing which Was food was okay we all liked the pizza"}
{"text":"There is one menu item that mozza does better than a lot of Italian restaurants, and that's the ruccola pizza. Thin white crust, fresh mozzarella, plenty of thinly sliced prosciutto, and a mountain of arugula salad. I've had a few other pizzas at mozza and none of them live up to this combination. I'd agree with a lot of other posters in saying that this place serves pretty average Italian pizzas, however, this particular pizza is a gem and keeps me coming back. This pizza is five stars sitting in a 3.5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for a 5 a 7.  For those who are not from Quebec, this is a after work social or work gathering where the conversation loosens up from the regular work blah blah.... or to my American friends better known as Happy Hour.  The place was bustling and the patio hopping on a Friday night!  

As my wife was there before and ordered me I just ended up eating a bit of her pizza and salad.  The salad a rucola was quite good but I found a tad salty but good none the less!  The Pizza the Calabrese I could have eaten a few more pieces as it was awesome!  Very light (thin crust) yet lots of flavour!  

The atmosphere of this place is quite nice and very lively!  

Definitely need to come back to try something else!"}

{"text":"So am at Mozza as we speak and I am still waiting for my food. Let me start from the beginning, I really wanted pizza, so I decided to come to Mozza, where in my opinion they make the best oven wood pizza. We were a group of 4 and they told us the wait would be 15 minutes, that was a lie, it took over half an hour. Then once we were seated, after all that wait, they told us they ran out of pizza, so we can't order pizza anymore. Of course I was disappointed, but I was hungry so I decided to get something else from the menu. I ordered veal parmesan. Service was extremely slow and it took over an hour to bring our food. Once they brought the food, my plate was not what I ordered, they brought me chicken parmesan instead. So I returned it, it took another 20 minutes for my plate to arrive by that time everybody else had finished their plate. Mozza use to be my favorite restaurant but I have noticed that they are slowly going down hill in the service and quality of food area. I am hoping they get there act back together again soon."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. We were greeted by a very friendly hostess and seated immediately on their terrace. The restaurant was pretty busy but it seemed like everyone was working at full speed ahead and were quite efficient!

We decided to get 1 family size pizza to share, Olivio, which is tomato sauce, olives, fresh tomatoes and basil and mozzarella. The pizza came to the table pretty quickly and looked delicious.

Looks were not deceiving! The crust was thin with the right amount of chew and had a lovely rim of char (not burnt) around the outer edge. Moments after it was placed on our table, we were offered fresh parmesan, chili flakes, fresh ground pepper and spicy oil. We chose to add some parmesan and the chili oil. If the pizza was great before, those extras took it over the top.

It was difficult to finish between the two of us. You could easily feed 3 people, even 4 if you got an appetizer to share. 

I will definitely be back to try some of their other menu items like chicken parmesan  :)"}

{"text":"Wood oven Pizza, how can you go wrong.  I'm surprised to see there are very few reviews about Mozza but if you have any reservations about trying it, don't hesitate.

I've frequented this spot many of times day and night, and I can't find anything negative to say.  Trust me, I like to pick at everything given the opportunity.  

Portions are great, service is very good and the food is fresh and tasty.  Nice atmosphere and the prices aren't jacked up so high to help them pay off the huge amount of capital they invested into the place.  

If you haven't brought your date here yet, what are you waiting for.  Borrow your dads car and go, you'll certainly score a few points and who knows what else. wink wink"}
{"text":"I normally don't like to make super generalizations, but I have not had a good pizza in Canada. So many other foods are amazing just not pizza, nor the pizza from here. I feel like I can write this because i have had pizza in a few places in different Canadian provinces and I haven't found a good place yet. The stuff we got was ok, but the waitress messed up our order and then it was downhill from there. I know I shouldn't expect much from a place like this but I feel a little more engagement with the guests is appropriate. I hate wasting food so I ate the wrong order which was the Genoa. It had just way too much gorgonzola (hence why we opted for mozzarella instead). But whatever, mistakes are made and that's life. The staff would probably do better by writing orders. The other was the Ripiena, which was ok. I'm convinced that if you want good pizza then you need to go to New York, New Jersey, Minas Gerais, or For the best quick pizza at Me n Ed's in the Central Valley of California. Come to Canada for almost anything else, just not pizza."}

This is my go to for Piña coladas! I am always so happy with they're service. All the waiters and waitresses remember me fondly and they know how I like my mixes to be super sweet. They make sure I love the drink and its to my liking all the time! They have an amazing food menu as well
Food: So far I tried their butchers board the half portion which looks super big I can only imagine what the big one looks like ahaha. They have amazing rustic wood oven baked pizza ! Super delicious. I shared it with friends. 

Overall, it's a beautiful place to come with friends or go on a date and even sit at the bar in their comfy chairs haha. I am definitely going to recommend this place and will return very shortly!"}
{"text":"Our server was so busy!; she looked over-worked and disturbed and extremely rushed. She told us 3 times \"I am going to bring you water\" and she forgot all 3 times!!! 
We had pasta and salad, both tasted decent but nothing too special. Fresh and nice bread to start the dinner with."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Not the best flavours but not bad , good portions. I took the soup of the day tasty, the salmon Cesar was ok not the best Cesar i had. Service is fast and very professional. Waiter was friendly and helpful.  Decor ok nothing fancy, Overall its an ok place."}
{"text":"I went to Italy a couple of times and this pizza is really resemblant. The ambiance is classy (perfect for a date or a family diner). Prices are great, good quality food and good service. I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Love this place .great food for great price .
The pizza is amazing and the salads are great.
The resturent are so nice I feel like I am in Vegas"}
{"text":"Très bonne bouffe.  J'ai commande le spaghetti à la Gigi de la table d'hôte.  Mon invité lui a commande une pizza. Hummm la pizza en croûte mince comme il se doit.  La bouffe restant très bonne et le menu de la table d'hôte très abordable compte tenu de la qualité."}
{"text":"The service is pretty good here but the food doesn't really stand out.  I had the pizza Calabrese which had sausage and hot peppers.  They serve thin crust pizzas here which is always my preferred style of pizza.  They also use a wood-burning oven which is a huge plus.  Overall though the pizza was way too salty.   For dessert I had the apple cobbler which once again was nothing spectacular.  It was also too big a serving for one person.  

If I'm in the area I'd go to Mozza but it's not a place I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"An example for many to follow. The food is really good and you can tell the recipes are from someone's italian grandmother in the kitchen. Staff is attentive and productive. Place is clean. Extremely well managed. Simple yet good menu."}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch as a large group and we were very well accomodated. This restaurant is large, with a big terrace in the summer and has a second floor that is perfect for groups. The location is very ideal downtown and steps away from our office.

Monza has a diverse Italian menu that offers a range of woodfired pizzas, paninis, pastas, salads and meat plates. I got to try the chicken panini served with garlic fries and a bit of their calabrese (spicy sausage) pizza- both were delicious.
My sandwich had a thick pan seared crusted chicken breast, house pesto, tomato, lettuce and provolone. I only ate half as I found the portion quite generous. I would recommend getting a salad instead of fries if you want a lighter lunch.
As for the pizza, these are thin crusts with also generous toppings and the dough has a beautiful taste only wood oven will achieve.

With a menu that is easy to please and a great ambiance, this is great spot for any occasion.

Prices range 15-30$.

They have a location in Centropolis Laval, West Island (DDO) and newly opened in St-Bruno too, so definitely worth checking out if you are off the island.

I will be back to try their pastas next!"}
{"text":"Mozza has a great terrace, fantastic service, and an amazing variety of pizza served fresh out of a wood-fired oven. So why only a two-star rating, you ask?

Well, unless you're jonesing for pizza, Mozza probably isn't the place for you. It's a one trick pony, meaning that anything else you order on the menu probably won't be as impressive  - or it will be overpriced. 

I speak from personal experience, of course; I've been a few times, and while I definitely enjoyed trying the pizza, the three pasta plates I sampled were among the worst I've tried in town. 

Nonetheless - grab a spot on the terrace, order a pizza and oddly enough, it will seem like a five star experience."}
{"text":"Loud loud loud

Had a drink and so glad I walked over to Bellagio instead

More bar than restaurant which is fine but I was looking forward to a relaxing dinner.

Mozza is fine if you want a more vibrant evening with friends"}
{"text":"I have been here couple of time with my office colleagues and recently with my friends. I like their salads. The vegetarian primvera pizza was good but not the best. however the eggplant parmesan appetizer was really  good! it tasted perfect. the food and the wine is expensive but once in while it is alright i guess."}
{"text":"Great service, polite servers , restaurant is very nice  but the food is tasteless ,the food is appealing looks delicious but ingredients is not good quality , it's a  kind of restaurant where you pay for the decoration and ambiance .
Would I go back here again? Once In a purple
Moon not even a blue moon ."}
{"text":"When we arrived it took a bit for the waitstaff to notice we were waiting for a table. When we finally got seated we saw that the pizza options looked really good. The server, to our surprise, informed us that they were doing a special where you could get the family size for the price of an individual size for any pizza, pasta, or salad. This seemed like a really good deal which is why we ended up splitting a family size pizza. I'm not sure how often they give out this deal but maybe every Sunday because we went on a Sunday night. The pizza was really delicious, we ordered the Spinacci and had a glass of wine. There weren't a lot of customers dining when we went, so the place was nice and quiet. They also had several large screen TVs showing sports. Overall, I thought the pizza was really good, had a lot of good flavor, and had a nice thin crust. The deal we got on the pizza made it even more delicious!"}
{"text":"This restaurant took me by surprise and to be honest, the bad reviews really didn't reflect the experience I had whatsoever. I would like to begin by noting that this restaurant is pretty big. There's tons of seating both inside and outside. It was also very clean. The music is good, but not loud. There are several TVs placed throughout the restaurant, which is perfect for those who want to catch a game of any sort. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my meal as well. There aren't many options for those with restrictions, and I was disappointed that there was no gluten-free pizza, but the pasta was fine as an alternative. They have gluten-free penne noodles and the sauce was great. Moreover, the fries were surprisingly good. One thing I'd like to mention is that our waitress was excellent. She double checked everything with the kitchen to make sure I could eat it, which was extremely accommodating. The prices were also reasonable considering how big the portions are. There seems to be something on the menu for everyone; it's not just Italian food.

Ignore the reviews and give this place a chance!"}
{"text":"I usually don't give bad reviews but this was not a good experience.
Outside patio staff checked with the kitchen and said they could do penne w/pesto sauce. We went inside due to the wind. After we were seated we were told no - they could not do pesto.
Ok - penne pomadoro - fine.
Then as we were given our food a huge group sat behind us - again not a huge deal. The people started getting up - walking around and at one point bumped into both my son & me...and the people at the next table (who left quickly).
Had someone asked if we wanted to move or even acknowledged that this was happening...maybe I wouldn't have written this.
All in all: meh food, a loud restaurant & staff that seemed inconvenienced.
I gave this a star because the guy who took dishes from the table was polite...he was the only pro in a sea of cons."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a nice restaurant both inside and out. There's a nice terrasse for you to enjoy in the summertime and the inside has a subtle rustic feel to it. Great for a date or for groups.

FOOD: The food is quite good! I got a panini and it was perfectly grilled. Although I do find their plates to be a little bit bland, the quality seemed pretty good which is a definite plus. The sharing plates are also quite big and seem well worth it. 

PRICE: Prices are pretty affordable considering the type of restaurant that this is. It's kind of like a lower-scale version of Scarolies. 

SERVICE: Our waiter was very friendly. Went out of his way to make up feel 100% comfortable with everything."}
{"text":"Horrible Service. The Waitress Was Rude & Always Absent We Searched For Her For Awhile Just To Order. 


The Food Was Ok Nothing Special. The Food Arrived So Fast We Were Surprised."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating here tonight and it was amazing. The girl serving us (I wish I could remember her name) was so so sweet and very helpful when we wanted suggestions on wine to try and different dishes. The food was great. I got the spaghetti bolognese and it was really good. The portions were huge. We also got a Mac and cheese appetizer which was to die for. 
Overall a great experience"}
{"text":"Our experience here was excellent.  Service was definitely superior compared to other nearby establishments, and the pizza and salad were very good.  Give these guys a go!"}
{"text":"Had not been to Monza  in a while , last time I was there it was called Mozza . So we were there on a Friday night a group of about 15 . Have to say I ordered a salad because it was late . Salad was ok nothing special  , but the dessert was amazing . I had the cookie monster , and all I can say is yum yum yum . If you are a dessert lover  , I definitely recommend Monza , as well the sangria was delicious. Overall the service was good , and fast  and fun  atmosphere ."}
{"text":"J'ai pas énormément apprécié ma visite dans ce restaurant. La qualité des aliments était très mauvaise. J'ai choisi le classique dans ce genre d'endroit : la pizza. J'ai été globalement déçu car peu fournie. Le fromage utilisé de piètre qualité. Trop peu de choix dans les garnitures. Le service était expéditif et la carte ne donnait pas envie. La deco et l'ambiance relevait un peu toute cette critique cependant. Je ne souhaite pas m'arrêter sur une note négative et j'encourage ceux qui me lisent a se faire une opinion par eux même. J'y retournerais sans doute pour finaliser ma review"}
{"text":"Très ordinaire mais typique de ces gros resto de nouveau centre d'achats à la cuisine très standard sans personnalité. Un lieu essentiellement utilitaire. Le choix et le prix des vins m'a paru correct, voire mieux que chez les pairs, cependant.

J'ai pris le veau qui n'était pas très bien exécuté et sans goût."}
{"text":"Food is good, nothing that throws your hair back, but solid quality and comes out piping hot. We were there on a fairly busy night and had to flag our server down a few times, but she promptly attended to our needs. I'd recommend it to anyone, but especially families with kiddos."}
{"text":"I love taking my family here, #loveofpizza. Staff is always friendly. Pricing is great when sharing or on individual orders"}
{"text":"Très déçu. Très très bruyant, la cage au sport est moins bruyante pour vous donnez une idée.

On est arrivé et un coup assit, Après 30 minutes d'attente, la serveuse est arrivé. Elle prend notre commande et nous amène notre eau environ 10 minutes plus tard. Notre entrée à prit environ 35 minutes à arrivé, période durant lequel nous n'avons jamais revu notre serveuse.

Nous avons pris les bruscheta en entrée. 5 petit morceau de biscuit avec un peu de bruscheta et fromage. Très cher pour le prix et la qualité.

Après avoir manger cela, un autre 30-45 minutes avant de recevoir notre pizza. On revoit au même moment notre serveuse qui remplis nos verre d'eau (qui sont extrêmement petit, genre 2 gorgée) puis elle disparaît à nouveau.

La pizza était correct. Rien de spécial, Rien de mauvais ou qui le donne le goût d'en reprendre. Après avoir fini manger, la serveuse est apparut 20 minutes plus tard nous demandant si nous voulons autre chose. On demande la facture. Encore un autre 10 minute pour recevoir la facture. Heureusement elle est resté pour que nous payons immédiatement.

La qualité n'est pas au rendez vous, le prix devrait refléter des ingrédients de qualité et non des substituts, le service est clairement défaillant. Bref, allez ailleurs en moins que vous désirez perdre votre temps, mal manger et perdre de l'argent."}
