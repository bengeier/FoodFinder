{"text":"Tired of chain restaurants like Friday's, Applebees, and those other gawd-awful places that load up your food with chemicals, additives, preservatives, fat and who knows what else?  Then it's worth a drive to Brunswick to eat at Madd Chef's Bistro. Chef/Owner Richard Cicic is a regional leader in the \"clean food\" movement. Madd Chef's features salads with crazy dressings, a variety of entrees, grinders and yes, french fries. But they are hand-cut Belgian-style fries, using fresh spuds and healthy oil. You also get your choice of catsup...curry catsup is v.g.! (Anyone who has been to Belgium knows the fries there are incredible.)  Cicic uses locally grown food without chemicals, hormones and trans fats.  He's  a rebel--he thinks Americans have forgotten what real food tastes like because our palate has gotten used to the artificial ingredients and chemically engineered food.  (Cicic was the Cleveland Clinic's Executive Chef  and helped get the junk out of their food.)  Locals know about this place and like it so much that Cicic has had to expand. He will also be serving wine and beer soon. Look for a Grand Re-Opening sometime in November.  Madd Chef's also caters and prepares HRM (home replacement meals) for those of us too lazy to cook our own meals. Yum."}
{"text":"Pretty good food with a different flair. The side for casual dining is the only one I been to and it's good and affordable. The other side is quite pricey however."}
{"text":"tip #1 make a reservation if you want to sit in the dining room.  we were stuck in the \"cafe\" area and although we ordered from the dining room menu, we felt a little cheated paying the high prices in the paper tablecloth section.  tip #2 order a drink.   I had one of the best martini's in a long time here.   tip #3 Yum.   That's not really a tip, but the food was good.  We went with pasta.  Only reason I didn't give it high ratings was because of were we sat and the price.  It was a little more than I was comfortable paying for a night out on the town in Brunswick."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have had lunch here about 10 times and dinner once.  When we first started coming here we loved it! Portions were huge, food was great but now the past couple of times have not been all that good!! We came here for dinner with our son. I got the Greek chicken pita salad, it was smaller than at lunchtime, the chicken tasted old, not cooked fresh to order it had that fowl yucky taste to it and my lettuce was half baby greens (the good stuff) and then huge chunks of iceberg lettuce!! Yuck! My son got the burger and fries for some reason his food was he last to come some b.s. about his fries being burnt and having to redo them!! Come on anyone who works in restaurant knows get the kids food first not last after everyone else! How do you burn fries?? Even the cooks at Mc Donald's can get that right. My boyfriend got the eggplant napoleon it which sounded good but it was also not cooked fresh to order and the definitely reheated in the microwave!! Soggy snotty cheese and tough rubbery noodles!   We decided maybe just dinners were bad because like i said we liked the lunches for the most part. We just ate here Thursday April 7 2011 and there was a sign up saying closing for the day at two it was just one so we had time. I thought it was odd though! So, we asked the server she said the owner was out of town.   I got the steak and potato salad hoping for fresh steak sliced and placed on top. No! It tasted like that cheap frozen steak-ums stuff gross!! Plus, the salad was very small for $8.29, mostly huge chunks of iceberg lettuce, no veggies but a couple of tiny little chunks! I asked for no cheddar cheese and blue cheese instead omg the was maybe one little crumble of it on top!!! My boyfriend got a huge $5.00 bowl of soup which was the onion bisque, not his or my favorite, a little better than Campbell's soup but not much! Then he got the margarita chicken pizza salad minus the chicken, he doesn't eat meat. The salad was tiny too nothing on top, the fresh mozzarella was maybe tablespoon size sliced piece, nothing else there either and he got charged $8.29 even without the chicken on top!!!! He then asked the server if there was a mistake because he was billed for the chicken salad even though his had NO chicken on top!! She said it doesn't matter same price with or without chicken!! That's the first time any restaurant has done that to him!! Come on chicken is the most expensive thing on there and he didn't get it!!! I think the salads at fast food restaurant's are better and cheaper too!! We will never ever be coming back and will be telling our friends and family not too either!!!"}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever had.  Dennys looks like a five stare restaurant compard to this place."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! We were there to experience the Tuscan dinner menu, and were pleased. Both pasta dishes were fantastic, as was the chicken they came with. The garlic breadsticks served as bread were also quite tasty. I'm interested to see how the menu changes - we heard it changes often.  The one thing I'd stay away from are the martinis. I tried the mango, and although a tasty mango puree, it lacked any of the alcohol we paid for. They have a wine and beer list though, so it's not an issue really.  We ate on the Bistro side, so I can't really comment on the cafe, but I did notice that it was bustling.  The bar right in the middle of the two spaces is also a nice place to grab a quick glass of wine or a beer."}
