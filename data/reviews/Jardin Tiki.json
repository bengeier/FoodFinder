{"text":"I feel that maybe I came here for the wrong thing but it's just not right when a place with food this terrible has a four star average on yelp. 

Let me clarify. I did not have drinks. I came here hungry. I looked at the buffet and thought it looked a bit sad but I thought my hunger would carry me through it. 

No such luck. 

This is by far the WORST fake chinese I've had, and I'm generally a fan of Americanized Chinese food. Most of the dishes were tasteless. Some of them had been sitting under the heat lamp for so long that they were hard and inedible. The selection was poor and they just never refilled certain dishes. 

The only saving grace? Their soft serve ice cream machine. Though that too is negated when the waitress actually stopped us from leaving for tip. I'm usually a generous tipper and I understand that waitstaff depend on tips--part of the misunderstanding was because we weren't sure how much we were supposed to leave for buffet service--but that no way justified the sour looks we got from our server after we've left the change.  Just a great way to top of a terrible dinner."}
{"text":"Ok so a friend wanted to go, we thought it would be a fun gag experience

It was 

the vibe in there is actually kind of awesome- the decor is silly but does look pretty good for what feels like an almost rurally suburban place. The place looks like its off of a highway in the USA or something- giant slab on a main street. Still you can see the olympic village right outside and thats kind of cool


The food is fairly gross as you expect of a greasy Chinese buffet.  but anyone could fill out their plate and many would have a pretty good time. ITs not BAD. 

they had 2 parties going on and the back room transformed into a kind of church basement vibe while people danced to cutely amateur local musicians and had a nice time

I kind of liked the place but wouldn't go back for the food. But I would go back before I die if someone else wanted to."}
{"text":"It's somewhere between a 2 and 3 star for me, I settled on two because the food is pretty horrid...like most buffet food I'm sure (I tend to stay far away from buffets, so don't quote me on it).

The drinks look really festive though, my hubby loved the one that came in a pineapple.

So go for the drinks, skip the food & you should be ok, but the drinks are nowhere near as affordable as the food (bummer)."}
{"text":"Le Jardin Tiki est le genre d'endroit où tu te rend en gang pour un repas style buffet sur la va-vite et quand tu n'as pas envis de mettre une crampe dans ton porte-feuille. Du gros buffet \"chinois\" comme on se rapelle des années 80 au look d'un - attendez la surprise - jardin tiki! Ben oui! Avec une petite fontaine, un aquarium de tortues avec un pont qui passe au-dessus, des grosses chaises en tiki, petite musique et cocktails des îsles au menu, c'est l'endroit parfait pour célébrer des fêtes thématiques. C'est pas chic, mais c'est comique! 

Pour vrai, mon 3 étoiles est vraiment parce que l'endroit est quétaine à l'os (et le sait) et le bouffe est quand même acceptable pour un buffet. On y retrouve les \"usual suspects\" - eggrolls, riz frit, petites saucisses sucrées, rondelles d'oignons, ailes de poulet, bar à salade, bar à desserts avec machine à crème glacée.  

Point boni: aucun de leur plat ne contient noix ou traces de noix, c'est donc le buffet rêvé des gens allergiques!"}
{"text":"I'm starting out at 3 stars on the \"good on you!\" principle for bravely combining Tiki chic with Quebecois-Chinese buffet. Bold choice.

The primary reason to come here would have to be the inexpensive festive fruity drink menu - the full blown Gobo in the pineapple will set you back 8$ and the other fancy drinks are cheaper. There is a band playing requests and cover songs - Latin mostly - on Saturdays. The staff is friendly. The Chinese buffet is usually 11$ and, well. It is what it is. Don't over think it. 

If you can come with a happy crowd and lose yourself in the loops of dreamy drifting Hawaiianish muzak, and in the drinks with their little umbrellas and plastic monkeys, and in a haze of shell lamps galore, near a whole pond full of real live turtles playing pile up... well, it's hard to imagine you'd have a bad time."}
{"text":"A step back into time isLa Jardin Tiki is one of them the the decor is like bein on a Gilligans  Island Show. Take  a date! You will have a blast!. The food is a sketchy Chinese buffet and  the drinks are funky. Let them know it is your birthday!"}
{"text":"East of Montreal, in hochela-maisonneuve, is a poor neighborhood, and still, there is this masterpiece of Kitsch. Like 1 year ago, a young local journalist published a work about Top spot for Kitsch. What is Kitsch, it's Jardin Tiki! It, somehow, work very well as a business, but the concept is quite akward. Akward isn't really the word to describe Jardin Tiki. Ok let's just start with what is this place. It'a cheap chinese buffet, typical chinese-american food. But when you get there, there's  a cocktail menu with and a hawaian decor. The crowd of Jardin tiki is also quite interesting. Old retired people that live in the surrounding of the restaurant area, poor family coming there to enjoy a cheap but convenient meal, hipsters in love with kitsch and vintage restaurant. Waiters and Waitresses had their golden age a long time ago but still manage to have friendly service. The food is more than average, like, it suck! But the experience, the cocktail (goro drink is served in a fresh pineapple) are cheap like hell. They,re a huge fountain with a dragon and some tiki lamp and some turtle in the fountain + some background hawaian tiki music.  It's kind of weird but funny at the same time. They've have a huge parking and last year it hold the 4th of 5th annual rockabilly festival. Some vintage car. Go there at least once and have the intention of drinking some fancy (and cheap) cool cocktails!"}
{"text":"This place is closing down at the end of the month -so I'm just writing this as a word of caution in case anyone, curious like me wanted to experience this place for a last time to be part of kitsch history. JUST DON'T!!

Surprisingly, this place was a full house on a Friday night. I guess everyone heard the news and wanted to check it out.

I thought it'd be a fun outting to dine in a cheesy tropical polynesian themed restaurant, I had low expections but didn't think it was possible to sink this low.

Food was horrific. Greasy, lacking flavor and selection, decor was old, dusty, grimy carpets, dingy lighting, bathrooms made me nauseous.
Service was so slow - We ordered cocktails that never came while others who dined with us received their drinks after half an hour and they were diluted, disgusting. 
Basically just food coloring in water mixed with a little ice.

This is by far the worse restaurant I have ever dined at in my life- I have traveled extensively, been to third world countries, eaten at crummy shacks in the middle of nowhere and never witnessed something this bad.

At 14$ a person + tax, I felt seriously disappointed. What a waste.

Overall depressing - avoid at all cost!!"}
