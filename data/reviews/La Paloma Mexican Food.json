{"text":"Used to be great. .. my go to spot. .. not so much anymore. .. I don't know what they did,  but the food tastes,, medicinal now.  Seriously,  what happened? !. I keep thinking \"it will be back to it's old self\" again..but no.  I gave them three chances, and its still not good.  I won't be back until I see some reviews that reflect a change for the better. ..."}
{"text":"I really like the food here.  Usually get the crispy beef tacos, rice and beans.  Tacos are a little small but really good.  Got a red tamale once, and it tasted good, but was a little hard and stale like it had been sitting around for awhile.  I want to say a little pricey but the only thing that's cheaper is like a filibertos type place and this is better food than those have.  Always have had good customer service."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and everyone is very friendly at this family owned establishment. I enjoy all the food but especially like the Carne Asada plate. Very reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"I would call this sub par Mexican food. Ordered shrimp tacos and one shredded chicken. The shrimp tacos were smothered in a spicy red tomato sauce with veggies (4star) but the tortillas were dry making it unpleasant. I ate the shrimp and veggies only. The shredded chicken taco had no sauce and was dry as a bone. The chips and salsa was good but not great. I would eat here only if I were on foot and unable to drive down the road for better Mexican food. Unfortunately this place isn't living up to its previous 4star rating."}
{"text":"Came on a Wednesday lunch hour (12-1pm) and it was packed! They were very busy with dine in orders and take out! Its a small place, with limited parking up front, but there is additional parking behind the building as well. I got the spinach enchiladas with beans. The beans were the BOMB!  Would come here again!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic and cheap. I usually get the taco, enchilada, beans and rice for like $6 and it is very good. Chips and salsa are free too."}
{"text":"Nothing special here just over priced Mexican food. Got two breakfast burritos and paid $15.00."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. We frequent order from an office building next door. The score is low because the delivery is SLOW. The charge for delivery is $4.00 and it takes sometimes an hour to show up. Please take note managers...your delivery sucks...good thing the food is so good :-) it almost makes up for it."}
{"text":"Great location for comfort food for wearied folks from the hospital. Cheese crisp was incredible and beans were also quite good.  Grill chef provided chopped fresh jalape√±o upon request.  There are a few tweaks that would make this a regular stop for me: fix ice machine for soda fountain and liven up salsa bar.  Restaurant and restrooms were very clean."}
{"text":"Dirty restaurant with an overwhelming smell of grease in the air, gross food and slow service."}
{"text":"La Paloma Mexican Grill is a little hole in the wall restaurant perhaps only the staff of St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center and surrounding office workers know about in, what I believe is, the Encanto Park neighborhood.  Don't let La Paloma's exterior or existence in a small strip mall overwhelmed by a medical supply store keep you from checking this great restaurant.  La Paloma is clean, the atmosphere friendly and the meals fresh, traditional and tasty. You order at the counter, then sit down to eat. For a Mexican restaurant, they have the typical dishes: Burritos, tacos, enchiladas, rice and beans.  The surprise here is the small section of the menu devoted to Korean cuisine. The owners are Korean, thus have to have dishes of their native land. My husband had their Beef Bulgogi, which is Korean beef barbecue with fresh vegetables and rice and loved it.   Craving guacamole, I went for chicken tacos and a side of a guacamole with an interesting spice combination.  The only issue we had is that my meal arrived about 10 minutes before my husband's meal. It could be his dish took longer to prepare and they are used to the lunch crowd, which can have a casual attitude toward meal arrivals, If that makes sense.   They are open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays and 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturdays. Closed Sundays.  If you find yourself in the area, or are curious about La Paloma, definitely check it out. We'll definitely go back there in the future."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Really nice staff (young girl taking order and serving). Food is very good, not great. Excellent prices and is authentic not like BS places like Ajo Al's.  Nice family owned place"}
{"text":"La Paloma catered a company meeting, and we were very satisfied with the food, good tasting and there was a LOT of it!! I worked with Lupe and Maria to come up with a mix of dishes to everyone's taste and the meeting was a success, with everyone lining up for seconds. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I tried and I tried. Really, I gave this place four or five tries to get it right but it just wasn't happening for me. The people are friendly, and that's, unfortunately, about it. The food is really greasy and tastes just like any other filibertos or rolibertos place (bad). The horchata is made from powder and it tastes really off. I tried the albondigas and took them back to my office for lunch and the rice was still hard inside the meatballs so I ate a few and then threw the rest away. This kind of stuff just kept happening and I was never satisfied so I just gave up. There are plenty of good Mexican food places around town to pick from. No need to settle!"}
{"text":"Food is reallyyy good - I always get the cheese enchilada (and I hate enchiladas) with a beef taco, and the fish tacos are AWESOME too. They deliver really quickly. Side note: if you get it delivered, have exact change if you're using cash. EXACT change. One of the delivery guys always refuses to let us pay separately with cash when we order for lunch at work and it turns into a huge confusing mess...more dollar bills thrown all over the table than the stage at your local strip joint. Just either pay with a card or make sure you have the exact amount!"}
{"text":"Great mexican food. Daily lunch specials. Quick service and reasonably priced. It is across the street from St. Joesph's Hospital, which is convenient for me. Have been here at least once a week."}
{"text":"I gave this place a try two times. Both times I've been very disappointed  on the quality if the food and their extremely slow service. The food made my tummy ache all day after I returned back to the office.  Unfortunately I will no longer return. Sorry la Paloma, I really wanted this to be my near neighborhood Mexican spot"}
