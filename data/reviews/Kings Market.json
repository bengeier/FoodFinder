{"text":"Their pozole was bomb. Carne Asada was tasty too. I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 as it was my understanding that the carne asada came with beans and rice. This was not the case. Also asked for extra limes and was willing to pay for them but just got a few with order. Given that it was good quality food and delivered I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"This place is the worst! They had nothing that was on the menu. The woman that was serving our order was moody and rude! Don't advertise a variety of foods and say you only have meat.. and nasty fatty meat at that. Not impressed considering this place has 4 stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Fantastic service, amazing fresh food at great prices. My favorite... Papusa-- sooo good! My daughter's favorite-- tamales, spicy! Hubbie's favorite-- steak quesadilla.  Their green salsa is fresh and delicious. Great street tacos... Everything is really good. Much better and cheaper than other fast Mexican food."}
