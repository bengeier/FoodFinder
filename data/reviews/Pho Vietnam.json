{"text":"1) Bún
I've been looking for a pho place that serves bún with this exact combination: spring roll, grille meat ball and shrimp on sugar cane. Finally found it here. 

2) Pho 
Broth was clear and light but still flavourful. Good amount of meat. 

3) Jackfruit milkshake 
Contains real jackfruit, not too blended so you could still feel the fruit. 

Restaurant was still 3/4 full on a Sunday night with a thunderstorm on the way. 
Service was fine, milkshake came at the me of our meal but maybe they were too busy or forgot. 

Would return here."}
{"text":"I like this place very much.
The food is really good.
I especially like the beef noodle soup and the grilled pork chop /w rice.
The waiters aren't bad,but don't do well at taking orders.
The washrooms are fine,but not perfect."}
{"text":"Rare Beef Pho with Fresh Noodles - I am excited to find a pho place that doesn't taste the same as every other pho place.  The broth is flavourful and the noodles are cooked perfectly (not soggy at all).  We planned to try another pho place nearby but changed our minds at the last minute.  It was cheaper but so dirty that even we were afraid to eat there. I'm glad because otherwise we wouldn't have found this place.  It was cleaner here and the food tasted good.  The beef was fresh and tender, the broth was a little greasy on top but had some depth to it and I liked the fresh noodles option.  I think out of all the pho I've tried in toronto this is my favourite so far.  4/5 noms (follow me on Instagram @nomtheworld)"}
{"text":"The layout of the restaurant is clean and spacious and it wasn't too busy on a Monday night. I got the beef tendon with rare beef pho with fresh thick noodles. The portion was decent but I found the soup to be too salty and full of MSG. I liked the place for its cleanliness, however it was presumptuous for the waitress to not give back change for $25 on a $19 bill. For this reason, I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"took out yesterday... The best spring rolls I have ever had. They are so good I am going out again today to get more. I also got vegan pho and it was good. The noodles, tofu and bok choy were all cooked to absolute perfection. The broth was a little bland but I get that.... hard to get the umami going with vegan broth so I'm not holding that against them. Next time might try a cooked noodle or rice dish instead"}
{"text":"when I first walked in I was impressed with the interior design. The thing is, I feel like that is where my compliments must end. Our waitress did not say one word to us. Not even hello. We just filled out our own piece of paper from the menu and she picked it up from us. There was literally no exchange of words. We ordered pad Thai and seafood soup with rice noodles. Fried spring rolls and fresh rolls to start. The pad Thai should not be called pad Thai. It tastes ok, but is not pad Thai just because it is stir fried rice stick noodles with a side of peanuts. It had celery in it! The pho style seafood soup, I think they call it Hu Tieu. Had very little flavor. It honestly tasted very watery. I was so disappointed because it looked very pretty presentation wise with the bright green chives/green onions floating in it. It was one of those gloomy, rainy days that called for soup, in which I left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Just finished a medium bowl of pho as i sit here and think about making a peanut butter sandwich when i get home to fill that empty void in my tummy. Servings here are small and the soup is bland."}
{"text":"I've been visiting this place for years now. Why? Good food, great service and cheap eats. On top of that, the place is clean and modern, unlike other sketchy pho joints. One of my favorites in Toronto!

Food: 5
Service: 4
Ambience: 4
Overall: 5 of 5 stars"}
{"text":"The pho is way too oily and they are very stingy with meat. Spend your money elsewhere.

{"text":"My family really like this place. Good portions and delicious pho.

I guess one can never go bad with pho. The Thai friend noodles were delicious too! Always loved it and orders it everytime. So spring rolls are not bad either."}
{"text":"Nice decor but food is not up to snuff. Much better Pho noodle soup else where in the area."}
{"text":"If i'd never had pho before, i might have liked this. but i have (many times), and i didn't.

the rare beef soup was the definition of average. ten minutes AFTER our soups came, our mango salad came. it was kinda yucky. the chicken was all last-chop dark meat with lots of fat and just not appetizing. 

the toilets were vile. and not \"one customer was inconsiderate\" style, but more like  \"there is grime for MONTHS in this toilet rim.\" 

getting our waitress to serve us was pretty vile, too. i had to go up to drop off my order slip, and go up to pay, after waiting ten minutes for that basic attention both times."}
{"text":"my husband and me both kinda like vietnamese food. so we went to visit this place while we were at scarborough.
It was decent food and interiors were neat and simple. And most of their dishes are around 8 to 10$. I went in for a stir fried egg noodle and my husband ordered a pho with pork which he said was delicious.Well, while i thought stir fried egg noodle will have chunks of egg - fried with noodles with some sauce or whatever ,it was quite different from what i thought. I believe the noodles was itself made of egg(which was the meaning behind egg noodle in the menu card :)) and was stir fried and topped with veggies when served which was not bad either !"}
{"text":"Found plastic in my food. Staff offered to exchange my meal and the food came back with plastic in it as well.

Waiting staff were very rude and slow."}
{"text":"The pho here is decent, but not great, plus, there were no fresh chilies to put in, and no fish sauce or black bean sauce. Methinks there are too many whities in here for it to be really good. They also give you those big plastic chopsticks that grip like PTFE.

The broth was sub-par, and the noodles were a little gummy. The place is clean and spacious, but lacked any sort of character.

Beef balls in general are the lowest grade of centrifugally-separated meat-like substance, but they seemed extra-inedible here.  The soft tendon was nicer than some I've had, but wasn't all melt-in-your-mouth goodness like it should be, the tendon adds a nice hearty flavour to the broth, but at most places, they sit forlorn and forgotten on the bottom when I'm done.

I'm not sure how the whole order-by-number, fill-out-your-own-receipt thing started, but it's lame and should be discontinued. How much of a time-saver is it when no two people fill it out the same way, and the waitress has to double-check the order anyways!

There are better and cheaper places to go in Scarborough."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 4.5 stars since they have very clean washrooms, pretty good ambiance, yummy Sambal Oelek-type sauce (which I'm fantasizing is homemade). Not to mention: I'm a frequent, happy diner here & I LOVE their Goi Cuon. Nobody does it better & there are FOUR big fat shrimp in each roll, generous amounts of lean pork slices, enough green onions, holy basil, etc.-- PACKED to the nines like an extreme hoarder's luggage case. 

Before this wonderful place opened or because of convenience & affordability, I usually go to Pho 88 at Bamburgh Circle or Xe Lua at Spadina, I NEVER order Goi Cuon at these places (anymore) because theirs' is so depressingly flimsy & lifeless-- like a deflated breast implant. Xe Lua's tragically emaciated rolls were accompanied by a side of plain Hoisin sauce instead of the peanutty Do Chua-laced deliciousness Pho Vietnam gladly plies you with. Pho 88 was shredded iceberg lettuce OVERKILL & had idiotic negligible amounts of the other necessary components of a quality Goi Cuon. Much cheaper Goi Cuon at the two crappy places. However (like most things in life), you get what you pay for. I'd rather pay nearly double what those shady Pho places charge for Goi Cuon-- for something as deliciously & properly made as Pho Vietnam's. I find it a bit pricey since I'm quite the cheap-ass but Pho Vietnam charges $5.50 for the small 2 roll platter/$10.50 for the large 4 roll one. Not too bad considering after downing 2-3 rolls, I'm quite full. I must point out (if I haven't gushed about Pho Vietnam's Goi Cuon enough already): They are SUPER worth the money due to the ensuing euphoria/multiple foodgasms.

Anyway, I really want this place to expand to the downtown core or uptown/Mt. Pleasant & Davisville-ish regions (instead of just Scarborough). Pity that good Pho & other Vietnamese goodies have to be super far away from all the other fun places I enjoy going to. Their P18 is very good (based on some chopstickfuls stolen from my mother & sister who ALWAYS order this marvel). There are lots of perfectly-cooked noodles, gelatinous/collagen-rich blocky bits, tripe, brisket, slices of lean beef, etc. It's all very substantial. The broth is super hearty & meatacular. It keeps me light-years away from ever pursuing any level of vegetarianism. Jesus must be fattening me up for his pet tiger or something. Meh, at least I'll die happy.

P.S.: I recently discovered (to my complete & utter horror) that if you refrigerate Goi Cuon for more than 2 hours (?), the rice paper & rice vermicelli within-- will become unpalatably tough & gross. I do not wish this 'phenomenon' on my worst enemies. Yes, it's THAT bad-- to part with yours or someone else's hard-earned money for something that's supposed to be delicious & have it become like stale rice cakes on meth. SO, the hard lesson I learned (that was tougher than the Goi Cuon's extended fridge stay & the ensuing strain on my molars): Do NOT order or make Goi Cuon if you aren't going to consume them immediately. Make sure your fridge isn't super cold & if you're just gonna let them sit on the counter, don't let it be in a disgustingly warm/poorly-insulated environment. Thank you/you're welcome."}
{"text":"Pho Vietnam used to be a great little restaurant that we would come to on a weekly basis with our family. The prices are now pretty high for a pho restaurant and for portions that are quite small compared to other restaurants. They also charge for ridiculous things. For example, they charge $1.50 to switch noodles to rice. I asked the waiter why they were charging extra since we are not adding anything, it's simply a swap. They just said that's their policy. So I asked them to give me both the rice and the noodles, since I was paying the $1.50 I should be able to have both. And they refused. Servers and cashier were both quite rude about it. It's not the money I was concerned about as its only $1.50 but the principle just did not make any sense and they could not justify. Overall I am quite disappointed with the restaurant and service, it is no where as good as it once used to be."}
{"text":"Delicious pho and courteous service. My bowl of noodles came at a reasonable time and the soup was delicious. Would definitely return soon to try other noodle selections!"}
{"text":"Me and the Hubby frequent this place on a bi-weekly basis. Its clean and cheap( we can both have seriously full bellies for under $20!!). Sometimes the a/c is a bit high, so bring a jacket.

The food is consistantly deeeeelicious. I always get the grilled beef or grilled chicken Pho (the meats are seasoned soo well). Call me a newbie but im just not a fan of tripe and other chewy body parts . The broth is salivation inducing with just the right amount of green onions and noodles. The spring rolls are crunchy and tasty as hell. When we are done we get the Taro Bubble tea to go, which never dissapoints. It also adds a nice sweet touch to our Phos, which we usually make very spicy.

Do yourself a favour and eat here."}
{"text":"Pho taste ok,which is same with most of pho restaurant. And we order a spring row. It taste good. This restaurant looks clean and the environment looks good too."}
{"text":"I come here quite a bit with my wife. This place never disappoints.  My wife usually orders the rare-beef noodle soup, while I usually go for the vermicelli (grilled pork and/or grilled chicken) with fish sauce.  VERY fresh tasting, and large portions.  The chicken spring rolls are tasty and crispy! I've tried almost everything on their menu.  Even non-specialty items like Pad Thai is awesome!  Of course, when you order items that are not broth or vermicelli-based, it will take much longer to come out.  I always order with Mango or Pineapple shake, and my wife always gets the coconut shake.  Their shakes are goooooood!  Pricing is super too! Appetizer, two mains, and two shakes usually comes out to just under $30 including taxes and tip.  Of course even cheaper if you just go with the (included) tea, or water!  One of my favorite places to eat!  Clean washrooms too (for those who care)."}
{"text":"when you want good pho around this area Pho Vietnam is a good choice. it's always a good sign when you walk in and there's a strong scent of the pho broth.

house special pho is delicious here. delicious being the soup. it's closest to authentic soup aside from Bong Lua (Birchmount/Huntingwood) in the Northwest parts of Scarborough.

always get fresh noodles. if you can't tell the difference, you're doing it wrong. dry noodles, even when cooked, are more brittle and will break apart especially in very hot broth. The beef is always fresh as well as the bean sprouts and basil. However, if you go for the large size it will feel as if there isn't enough beef to balance the amount of noodles."}
{"text":"Quick service, delicious pho, good coffee. My new favourite east of Spadina."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place on a regular basis for years. The last time I was there I was disappointed by the lack of service. 

I was there with my family on the weekend and asked for extra plates. The owner actually came out and said I did not have a big enough order for extra plates. I was shocked and amazed. Then I asked for waiter for water and that came out with stuff floating in it. At this point I was ready to leave.

Customer service and cleanliness is so critical in today's world and because of my very poor experience, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Ce modeste et charmant restaurant vietnamien, toujours bondé de curieux et d'adeptes, en bordure du quartier chinois de Montréal, a de quoi ragaillardir les palais avides de découvertes orientales. Vous n'y trouverez pas cependant la finesse et la classe de la haute gastronomie asiatique... Pho Vietnam (pho signifie soupe), excelle dans ce qu'il sait faire de mieux : les soupes tonkinoises au bouillon parfumé, plus que réconfortant. L'on peut aussi se repaître d'un vaste menu aux mets simples et colorés, typiquement vietnamiens. Rouleaux de printemps, grillades, vermicelles, riz, nouilles, etc. Et si le temps presse, ou encore, si le resto est plein à craquer (ce qui n'est pas rare), un comptoir pour emporter est à votre disposition.

Le personnel, jovial et trilingue (français approximatif, anglais et vietnamien) est très efficace et ne lésine pas sur les portions généreuses. Une théière remplie d'un succulent thé au jasmin est même incluse à chaque repas, rendant ainsi le rapport qualité prix indéniable.

Incontournable : le traditionnel café glacé à la « viet », supposément infusé d'une mouture moins connue en Amérique, à savoir, le robusta.

Chic endroit pour manger et faire des rencontres inusitées! À découvrir baguettes entre les mains, bien-sûr!"}
{"text":"One of the better pho restaurants in Scarborough and is an authentic Vietnamese owned restaurant.

Prices are good, service is quick, and the pho here is great and makes amazing comfort food on a super cold day in the city. Also, try the \"bo la lot\" appetizer there. Can't remember what it's called in English, but it's good."}
{"text":"Real traditional Vietnamese food.  The place is clean with high ceiling.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Location: Located in the third plaza on Midland north of Finch  (most flashy one). Drive to the very end and it will be on the left (south side). 

Facility: Decor is modern and clean. Washrooms are nice for a pho place. Lots of space but even when we went it was at 80% capacity. 

Food Quality & Price: I can go anywhere for pho and I don't come to Pho Vietnam for it. In fact, I come to Pho Vietnam for one dish only. The Vietnamese sour soup with fish (TS2) with \"bac ha\" (see photo). I order a side of rice and split a mackerel with my family. Absolutely delicious! Sometimes I crave authentic Vietnamese cuisine that isn't pho and this really fits the bill!

Of course it takes a little longer to make but I have a feeling the cooks enjoy making something other than the standard fare when we come to visit. 

To be fair, their pho is okay. Not the worst, not the best. Prices are fair which is why they get good business in a plaza full of competition.

Service: Chris is a wonderful server. He made good conversation and made sure that we ordered the correct dish with bac ha. Turnover is efficient but not pushy. Staff mainly speak Vietnamese although one or two do speak Cantonese. But don't assume.

Overall: I quite enjoy my experience at Pho Vietnam. It's very difficult to stand out when you're surrounded by so much competition. But keep prices fair and never remove your staples and you'll have me coming back in no time!"}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time when I lived in Scarborough, now I live in Etobicoke and when I get a craving for the deep dried noodles with seafood I drive all the way to Scarborough to this place. Its the best! The prices are a little more expensive . not to mention the gas but its the best crispy noodle dish I've tried so far! And the presentation of it it the nicest as well"}
{"text":"The pho was good! The interior is very modern like. 

Service was very good, waiter was attentive and always topped up our cold teas. The prices are a little higher than usual, but the food made up for it. I tend to go to this location + the Kennedy one as well. Pretty consistent."}
{"text":"Of all the Vietnamese restaurants in Scarborough, this one's my favourite.  

First of all, it's run by real Vietnamese people.  I always get the Bun (vermicelli bowls) and they are always fresh and yummy.  The spring rolls and grilled meats are awesome.  I can't say anything about the Pho, as I am not a beef noodle soup person.  Other items that I've also liked were: fresh shrimp rolls, fried shrimp rolls (individually wrapped crispy fried shrimp) and crab & asparagus soup.  

Restaurant is bright, clean and fairly modern.  Prices are mostly under $10 per person.  Fruit shakes are good, but ask for them in the take-away container as it is about 50% bigger than the dine-in glass!  The service can also be terrible sometimes, and no one's ever thanked me goodbye."}
{"text":"A spacious restaurant with numerous tables.  I decided on duck vermicelli.  For the future, I would order something different.  It was messy eating the duck meat from the soup as it wasn't boneless.  I usually go for beef vermicelli when eating Vietnamese.  The fresh spring rolls were enjoyable and my associate found the vegetable chicken stir fry to be flavourful."}
{"text":"Love this place! If you enjoy traditional Vietnamese food this place is for you. Servers barely speak English but the food is very tasty and good portions. If your looking for fine dinning or an overly attentive wait staff this place is not for you! PHO is as authentic as you can get in Toronto."}
{"text":"The best Pho Noodle Soup in the area. 
Very good service. Clean interior and washrooms, fast servers.
Like most Pho restaurants I've been, they tried to fool me one time by giving me the bill for another table, but they fix it after I told them."}
{"text":"Used to be good, but its gone way down hill. The rare beef pho was the blandest pho I've ever had. Also there were several large disgusting flies flying around and the men's room was filthy with an overflowing trash can. Used to be one of my favorite pho places in Scarborough, now I will never return. Maybe its run by new owners now, because its a pale comparison to a few years ago."}
{"text":"Pho Vietnam is one of the best Vietnamese restaurant I have been to. Awesome food. I love the grilled chicken and rice."}
{"text":"worst pho place!!!! came in and requested for a booth after the waiter said they were cleaning and could not, 1 minute later an older couple walk in and they ask for the same thing and are immediately moved to the booth. the food was tasteless. no service at all. not once did anyone ask us anything. when it was time to pay no-one brough a bill we walked to the counter ourselves. rude people, bad service, tasteless food! would not recommend!"}
{"text":"This just seemed like an ordinary pho place to me. I've had better at places like Pho 88 and Vietnam Noodle Star. I don't know if it was just this time but I felt like they skimped on the noodles and beef in my large pho. The flavor was good and the service was fast though. I just would have liked the same bang for my buck as the other places."}
{"text":"A bit pricier than most places and the food doesn't really stand out. However the decor is nice and clean. When I come here the parking isn't a problem either."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite recently after not visiting in awhile and the prices all went up!  The food quality and portions are still all the same.  Just ok nothing spectacular.  Found myself a new pho joint down the street at Kennedy and Ellesmere better price and better pho."}
{"text":"This place sucks.

My husband and I went in for a quick lunch. Now, we're both seasoned Asian-restaurant-goers; we know the average price range, we know what's cheap. This restaurant is not cheap. It's average for a Pho restaurant, expensive for a standard Asian one, and has the absolute worst food I've had in a long time.

It took us about 5 minutes to order. After that, we waited for at least a good 20-30 minutes to get our first dish. Many people who had came and ordered after us already had theirs, which was upsetting to me. My husband got his dish first - by at least 20 minutes. When mine had finally come out of the kitchen, his dish was cold (I'm not going to apologize for him being civilized enough to wait for me - this shouldn't have happened!).

We started eating, both our dishes were simply loaded with sauce - and not good, fresh sauce either. This stuff tasted like they bought the Asian stir fry sauces from the PC brand at your local grocery store. Seriously?

My husband's stir fry came with no noodles and no rice. Our fault for not reading more closely, but really, who expects to get their stir fry without some carbs?

It was worse than the $7.99 meals you could get at fast-food stir fry places. And it was way more expensive.

One of the waitresses was rudely chewing gum with her mouth open, which I thought was completely disgusting.

What we hoped would be a \"quick lunch\" turned into over an hour affair, and for a meal that neither of us enjoyed.

We will never set foot in there again."}
{"text":"I used to come here often because they had one of the best pho in Scarborough along with decent service. However, they started going downhill when they started cutting their ingredients down. The last time I went there I ordered the lemongrass chicken with rice and the whole plate was just rice...the chicken was around the size of three bites and it wasn't even worth half the price. Mind you, that costed (if I remember correctly) $11. When we made a complaint, they didn't bother doing anything about it and that was the last time I've eaten there."}
{"text":"We use to frequent this place very often because the food is great. However last time we were there we had to walk out because 20 minutes after ordering our food we noticed that ppl who just walked in got there food right away which was the exact same thing we ordered. I don't knows why this was happening it was really frustrating. I really hope it wasn't a race thing. I'm sad to say we won't be back due to horrible service."}
{"text":"A certain go-to spot for consistent quality of pho and other Vietnamese dishes. The service could be spotty depending on your server (especially the owners), but generally they are pleasant and will make sure you get what you need. 

Just a note for people coming in groups of 6 or more, you'll be charged with a fixed 15% service charge on top of your bill. While I would usually have qualms about restaurants charging a 15% premium, the service was actually decent so it did merit the few extra pennies out of your pocket. 
----------
As an update to my review (Nov 2017) the service has definitely gone downhill. The food overall has remained somewhat the same. However the portions definitely has decreased in size. Overall not the same experience as I've had previously."}
{"text":"Came here on a cold, snowy Saturday evening. Seated quickly, ordered quickly, served quickly. Pho was just right (small bowl is actually quite filling, only $6.99, as at Jan. 4, 2014) and I ordered spring rolls on the side and they were DELISH. I would come back here just for the spring rolls."}
{"text":"Usually come here for a Casual quick dinner / late lunch. Comfortable seating and decor. Pretty clean restaurant, located in the plaza all the way at the back. 

Recommendations/ usual orders :
Tasty broth for the house special pho 
Banh Cuon
Bun cha vermicelli (w/ chicken)

Would not recommend the bun rieu if you're hungry, takes 10 mins or more to make as indicated on the menu."}
{"text":"Very good Pho & vegetarian spring rolls. Chicken curry was pretty decent. Definitely will return to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"In 2014 I went on a 3 week tour of Vietnam from North to South, tasting the various cuisines country-wide. Pho Vietnam's fare is reminiscent of North Vietnam.  The food is fresh and tasty and not too spicy. Service was courtesies and fast. The establishment looked clean also, which is a bonus. I would come back."}
{"text":"We are frequent patrons of this restaurant, but it has gone down hill recently.  The broth is not as fragrant, seems watered down.  Usually they serve you hot tea, but I noticed one of our glasses still had a big lipstick mark in it.
Don't know if they've changed ownership, it's not as it was before.  So disappointed, and I usually travel from north Markham."}
{"text":"The pho is kinda over priced and it was ok. It wasn't the best pho I'd ever had. The interior was nice and modern. When my friend and I were eating the waiters kept on staring at us and it made us feel unpleasant."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often with my friends and family, we've never had a problem with their classic menu items like the Pho or the 'bun\". They've got a fairly large space, air conditioning's good, and their drinks are okay (I like the coconut milkshake, avocado milkshake, and their Vietnamese Coffee). 

Their take on pad thai is okay, and their fried chicken is pretty good and fairly cheap for 6 pc ($10.99). Order the fried chicken first if you want it as it takes a while to make."}
{"text":"I don't know... I don't think their pho is just that great. The flavour of the broth isn't strong or pungent like other places I've been to. Their bun bo hue is also very inconsistent - some days, it's spicy others, it just taste like shrimp paste out of the jar.

I don't find the staff here very nice either. I mean, I'm not expecting you to be forcefully nice to us but a smile goes a long way."}
{"text":"the pho ga (chicken pho) tastes amazing. nice atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I'm new to Pho noodle soup.  However, my wife and I had stopped int to try Pho Vietnam on a Friday night..about an hour before closing time.

We ordered Pad thai noodles and the Pork Pho noodle soup.

We really enjoyed their Pad Thai noodles would definitely order again, along with grilled pork Pho.

We also ordered the small summer roll, this only comes with 2 pieces for 6 bux.  Tasty as it was..bit much for only 2 pieces, perhaps for 6 dollars maybe 3 or 4 pieces.

Nice casual environment, no wifi, small tv screen.  Friendly staff.

Little pricey for our budget but good for a treat or a change of pace from our regular chinese take out/dine in spots."}
{"text":"Food 3/5 (60% of final grade)
I ordered the small house special pho, and it was pretty yummy (in the most this-is-standard-pho-I-already-love-it sense). Standard pho, what to say? The noodles weren't particularly fresh, the beef wasn't particularly succulent, and the broth wasn't particularly fantastical. It was not a particular bowl of noodles.

Ambiance 3/5 (10% of final grade)
Walk in and you know you're in a conventional Vietnamese pho restaurant, that's how it is. 

Service 2/5 (10% of final grade)
The lady was rude when we requested for separate bills-- we even told her right at the get go before we've ordered anything, because we understood how hard it would be for her. But nope. She ended up still splitting it for us, but not without giving us some attitude. If you're going to split it for us anyway, why do you even bother giving us attitude? 

Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade)
Standard pricing for standard food. 

Brownie Points 0/5 (10% of final grade)
Not going to be a favourite.

Final Grade = 51/100 = 3 Stars

TLDR:  Looking for comfort pho, and within walking distance? Come here! If you're looking for a different experience though, then not here. This is a place you can come to with old friends, or for a loner dinner/lunch. Trying to impress? Not here."}
{"text":"They have a spacious unit with high ceilings and everything is clean. The tea that is serve is different from other pho places and I really like it. 

For an appetizer, I usually order A6 which is the deep fried spring roll. I always choose the chicken and taro option. The deep fried spring roll does not disappoint. It comes out piping hot and you can taste the chicken and taro. Highly recommend this. 

I always order their medium P1 House Special Beef with Noodle. I like that fact that they give you a choice of dry noodles or fresh noodles. I always choose fresh noodles because it is thicker and I thought that it tasted better with the soup.  The broth is not that oily and not that salty as well compared to other pho places. After I finish my pho, I was not consistently drinking up their tea.

This is my go to place when I am craving pho."}
{"text":"Well....today was a disappointment. The food was actually great when it arrived 45 mins later. I go to their other location all the time on Kennedy. I came here to this location once before and it was empty so we got our food right away. We got one dish within 10 mins and the other 3 came 45 mins later. 4 staff came over within that time and they all had some different excuse to why it hasn't arrived. My pho came out and it was really good. Been to tons of Pho places around Toronto and had it in Vietnam many times. The lateness and constant excuses that were all different was disappointing. The decor is nice except they have a random box stacked above the entrance since the last time I came a month ago. The other food came out 45 mins later for the other 3 people, it was the Vietnamese pancake, a friend rice and spicy beef noodle soup. All dishes were good but again super late and very unorganized. Hopefully they get their organization together and I can come back and give a better rating."}
{"text":"I have this friend whom I work with, she's quite possibly the coolest girl around and when I offered to take her for lunch ANYWHERE she wanted as a thank you for all her hard work, she requested Pho Vietnam with little hesitation. 

Located at the rear of a plaza just north of Finch, this location is is bustling every day of the week, all day - And with reason. The Pho (pronounced 'fuh') is wonderful, clear tasty broth, reasonably priced, with perfectly cooked meats. 

Staff here are slightly more attentive than your average pho place, so that for me warrants an extra star! The decor of this place is very modern and new, unlike other spots where you feel like your in a restaurant from the 80's.

In addition to my medium Pho (which I got with every kind of meat offered: rare beef, tendon, meatballs, tripe, and more) we shared the deep fried spring roll, which was crunchy, delicious and jam packed with flavour! Yum!!

I'm more than excited to return here now that the cold weather is here to stay. 

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I didn't have very high expectations going into this, but i think I was pleasantly surprised overall. When I go to vietnamese restaurants I often just order the rice, instead of pho, and it's exactly what i did this time! I ordered the pork chop on rice with egg along with a coconut milkshake. Overall I think it was well executed, the portion and the price was balanced, flavours were decent, but maybe just a tad too much oil on the meat. I was very happy with my milkshake though, since there were actual coconut chunks in them. 

Setting wise, I was also happy, b/c it was clean, which is a rare site for most asian restaurants that I frequent. In terms of service, there really wasn't much to speak of. You write your own orders on a sheet and just give it to the waitress. To be honest I don't even remember looking my waitress in the face, or talking to her for that matter. In addition you pay at the counter, so once again, no service to speak of. However, the food did come quickly in my opinion.

Overall this isn't the best vietnamese food I've had, but certainly not the worst. I'd return if the opportunity arises, but it's not really a place I'd get uber excited over either."}
{"text":"Above average for Vietnamese good. Meat was not dry & veggies were fresh. The soup base for noodles was flavourful but not salty. Avocado shake was rich & creamy & not too sweet."}
{"text":"Awesome service, cleaner than most pho places, and food is great. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this place as I'm a big fan of authentic Vietnamese food and this place from the exterior seemed like something similar to pho 88.  I was completely wrong.  Their menu was very extensive with many Vietnamese authentic dishes.  The tea was also genuine tea that traditional Vietnamese places serve and it tasted great. 

I ordered spring rolls and the large special pho bowl with everything, including yummy tendon, tripe, beef balls, rare beef and all those delicious things.  The bowl was huge and came out piping hot.  My favourite thing about it was that I was able to order fresh noodles.  Fresh noodles are 10 times better than dry and it's rare to have them at a GTA Pho restaurant.  Broth was great and they even steamed the bean sprouts for your pho, which was a nice touch!

Service was great and probably some of the best Pho I've had around the Scarborough area.  I'll definitely be coming back for more and look forward to trying other dishes and drinks!"}
{"text":"I went here Thursday evening with my friend. I got the grilled chicken pho and almost immediately after eating it I had the worst stomach pain. I vomited about an hour or so after eating. Throughout the weekend I was unable to eat anything without vomiting. I went to the hospital today and they confirmed it was food poisoning. Will not be going here again unfortunately as the chicken was not cooked properly."}
{"text":"This became one of my favourite pho places! The broth is amazing for pho & the pad Thai is absolutely delicious!! I would give it perfect ratings but the wait for the food is a bit longer than usual. Overall, I would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place all the time when I lived in Scarborough.  They have great grilled chicken and awesome avocado shakes!
This is a great lunch spot!  The prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"Waitress does not seem.to be too friendly but the location and environment is relaxing and decently clean compared to many pho restaurants nearby. They have interesting decorations and the music is not blasting.
 The broth is flavourful and the price is average for a pho place. I normally order a house special and never had any problems with it. The spring rolls are also great."}
{"text":"Very good pho! This is a newer restaurant located in the same plaza as chatime but you have to go all the way to the end and it will be on your left. The decor is nice and everything is very clean. The service was very efficient and friendly.

We ordered a large rare beef pho. The broth was very good and tasted really clean. As another reviewer noted it lacked the scummy/filmy bubbles that can sometimes be found on the surface of the broth. I really appreciated that. We also ordered the vermicelli with spring roll and grilled pork. It was pretty good but only wish that there were more noodles. We also shared an order of chicken wings. This was only ok. It came with a special sauce that tasted like nothing more than French salad dressing with sriracha. Not really a fan.

I would definitely come back for more pho. It's a little pricier than some of the other Vietnamese places in Scarborough but well worth it for the overall cleanliness."}
{"text":"Uh... It's a pho place.  Take it or leave it - I just wouldn't go out of my way to come here because it is just so... meh.  I honestly think I've been here before, but I just cannot recall.

The fresh rice paper rolls were fresh as you would expect.  The small is for 2 rolls and the large is 4.  The pho is alright.

This stretch of Kennedy is full of warehouses and furniture and electronic shops, so this restaurant might be an option for a quick meal after a day spent shopping."}
{"text":"I love that this location had opened up in this neck of the woods. Pho places around the area tend to lean toward the utilitarian esthetic, leaving you with a general desire to wash all your clothes after a visit, even as you go to them for their addictive soup and slurpy noodles.

Unlike other pho restaurants, this place feels much cleaner. The high ceilings and new decor actually make this place feel more like a restaurant than a cafeteria.

I had a large order of fresh rolls (rice wrapper, vermicelli, mint, shrimp, pork) which came in at a somewhat pricy $10.50 for 4 pieces. They were as expected and got the spot for a light lunch. I sampled my Hubby's pho. While the tendon was super soft and delicious, the soup felt a little light in flavour. Impossible as it seems, the pho orders at the table actually came last, a significant amount of time after the other, seemingly more complicated orders had already arrived. Really not sure what happened here as the noodle soups are always the first to be served.

We came on a Sunday afternoon and were seated right away, which is somewhat unusual for restaurants in the address that normally have line ups during the lunch hour. It's probably because this place is still relatively new in comparison to the other entrenched pho places in the area. Plus, it's a bit hidden in the back of the plaza, though the restaurant itself is a good size."}
{"text":"I find the pho here to be ok. But what strikes me most about the place is just how terrible the service is. They bring food out in whatever order suits them. Twice I've found myself watching my soup cool while waiting up to ten minutes for my companion's to arrive. Appetizers are a bit dried out and the dipping sauces are watered down.  Greens for the soup are skimpy. So despite decent soup, they've really find a lot of ways to leave me I unsatisfied. I managed to pay at the cashier without even a hint of smile, eye contact or other human kindness. 

Given how little effort is put into the front of house, I'm concerned about what goes on in the kitchen. Not going back.  What a waste.  It would would have taken very little effort to have made this a five star review."}
{"text":"Consistently good pho place. They have small, medium and large size bowls which is great you can pick based on how hungry you are. I ordered a small beef brisket pho which was perfect, I was able to finish in one sitting. And for 7.50 price is very reasonable! The broth was one of the best I've ever had. They also have 2 styles of noodles, a pre-cooked thick noodle and a dry thin noodle, I've never been given this option at any other pho place and I kinda like it The Vietnamese sausage app was also quite tasty. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for Pho"}
{"text":"Great food, good service. This is the only place I've been going to for Vietnamese food since it opened. It seems like other pho places all go downhill after a while but this one has kept their quality like it was day one. 

My favorite dish is the vermicelli with grilled pork and Vietnamese sausages (#B4 on the menu) and the deep fried chicken wings (takes 10 mins to make so we always order it first right when we sit down. Their summer rolls are also pretty good. I have tried quite a few dishes off the menu and I've yet to be disappointed. 

I believe a second location is opening soon so I'm quite looking forward to trying it out there as well."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly, one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto.

Decor: The environment is pleasant and more pleasant is of course the clean washroom.

Foods: Remarkably well seasoned from its rice platters, to phos, to chicken curry, to its spring rolls, to its vermicilli noddles - double set of thumbs up.

Having it ten minutes for my convenience also helps greatly.

Parking: could be limited during busy hours, but its terrific foods will keep you returning."}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying their wait staff are great and very attentive. Food isn't bad so my family and I come here all the time. . What ticked me off the last time was their owner/manager. For some reason they don't have Com Thit Nuong (rice and grilled pork - not porkchop) on their menu. They do however have Bun Thit Nuong (vermicelli). I prefer rice so I ask if they can substitute the vermicelli for rice - No. It's a $2.00 surcharge to ADD rice (what?!). Okay so I asked them if I ADD the rice for $2 more do I still get the vermicelli? No! So first off I'm paying for Vermicelli and adding rice to the meal yet they're giving me rice only? I ask the manager/owner, what's the difference if I order Bun Thit Nuong and order a side of white rice? I'm still paying for the rice...you guessed it..\"no you can't do that!\".......because of this incident I've stopped coming back here."}
{"text":"The taste is delicious, this is the beat Pho in Scarborough. It was a surprise. The soup just perfect, I can taste the spices but well balanced."}
{"text":"I have no idea why people have rated this place anything good. Their service is terrible- they bring food to the table in any order they find convenient for themselves. I had my pho brought to my table then waited at least another 10 mins, while it got cold, for my friend to get his. The waitress was cold and barely maintained eye contact, it took her forever to get the glass of water we asked for.
 
We sat at a corner table and the wall was disgustingly dirty. With their cleanliness and service standards it makes you wonder what goes on in the kitchen"}
{"text":"Noodles were good, broth was tasty, and lots of toppings in the bowl. 

Pork chop was well marinated and was also tasty.

Overall, I would return soon.

Service was good 4 stars"}
{"text":"Very very delicious large portions.

Beef phone was delicious.
Vietnamese pizza : Banh Xeo (Vietnamese Crepe with Shrimp, Chicken & Bean Sprouts)

Was a big meal of its own although it was under the appetizers.

We all loved it, never had one of these before.

I have been passing by this joint for a very long time, as it is on a very busy street.

The chef even came out yo explain us about the portion size. Good and friendly place"}
{"text":"With all the pho restaurants and around the midland and finch area this is literally a hidden gem. Sitting at the back of the plaza this place is fantastic. With a light but full of flavour broth it is most definitely a big contender for the pho lover. With a perfect portions and cozy atmosphere it's a perfect place for a date. I had the raw beef with fresh noodles and all I can say yum yum yum I also had the Vietnamese sausage pork roll. Let me tell you they may be small but they are full of flavour. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to try a new pho place. Oh and my daughter had the steamed rice with grilled chicken and she loved it"}
{"text":"Came here to grab dinner on a thursday night with my girlfriend. Just a mediocre viet restaurant with nothing outstanding. Clean overall. Soup noodle was served really hot on the plus side. Spring rolls was with chicken and taro - had much better spring rolls elsewhere. Wouldnt come specifically here for their viet food as there are many other options in markham"}
{"text":"This is my go to pho place. Broth is delicious - tons of the aromatics and fresh spices are very much present. Typical pho menu, but I haven't had a dish I didn't like.

If you are into vermicelli it is a win too. Often I find a place is better for pho or vermicelli, but with this one you can have both!

I haven't seen any banh mi on the menu (or I haven't tried it). Appetizers are nice - spring rolls and shrimp paste on sugar cane are top notch.

If you are going here with more of a \"North American\" crew that are a bit more sensitive to decor and cleanliness, you'll be safe. It's a good spot.

I talked to who I believe is the owner, and she was giving me the recipe for the complimentary tea (which is really good) - it's a blend of green and black leaves.

Whether you are trying to get over a cold, it's a rainy day or you are looking for some quality comfort food in a relaxed and affordable setting - this is a great choice."}
{"text":"Sadly this isn't the same Pho Vietnam that I once knew.

It looks like they have new ownership, and the quality and service from this place has dropped off a cliff.

The last few times I've been back, the quality of the food was only ok.  The grilled pork on the Bun no longer tastes like it came fresh off a grill, rather, pan fried or even nuked?  It was a soggy mess.

And my last service, whether they just plain forgot me, it took over 25 minutes for them to serve me my Pho.  The servers all kept starring at me, until at the 20 minute mark I asked the server about my food, as she casually (and slowly might I add) cleaned up the table next to me and said she'll check, as if she was doing me a huge favour.

It's too bad, as this place used to be on my regular rotation."}
{"text":"Great food, average prices, and large portions!

The decor is nice and the service is great. I came on a Saturday night and they were quite busy.

I ordered their grilled chicken with rice ($10.99). Their chicken was tender and rice was finely chopped. My partner ordered the large rare beef pho ($10.00) and it was larger than most! It's probably comparable to an XL at other pho restaurants. They always ask if you prefer fresh noodles or dried noodles. Personally, I like their fresh noodles as I find them to be chewier and thicker than the dried ones. They also give you a plate of bean sprouts, which you can request to be cooked before serving. The soup base isn't too strong but has a nice beef-y taste to it.

To be honest, this is place is one of the better pho places in the area. Definitely a place that I shall return to!"}
{"text":"i notice that they actually don't have non meat pho, i had the seafood one. They asked me to write down my order, I asked for a vegetarian option for pho and it was weird the server was kind of mean (well i mean not mean but like a little rude or something) It's pretty good for Medium sized pho for $11"}
{"text":"Of the Pho places in Scarborough, I would rate this one right up there with the best of them. The place is pretty modern inside and looks like it must have been renovated recently.
The menu is quite big, and has your staple appetizers like spring rolls, cold rice rolls, etc.
We ordered a 2 roll serving of the spring roll along with a large bowl of beef brisket, tendon, and tripe Pho. The Pho has a selection between fresh and dry noodles.
The Pho came first, and actually arrived at our table almost immediately after ordering. The portion size for the Pho is quite large and there was a generous amount of beef. It was enough for two people and seemed to be slightly on the larger side compared to other Pho places. The soup base was just right, not too salty. The brisket was thinly sliced. The tendon was tender.
The spring rolls came shortly after. It contains a mix of pork, shrimp, and taro, and had a chewy texture, which was nice.
The bill came out to $20 after tax and tip.
For those craving some Pho, I would check this place out!"}
{"text":"I didnt really like this place. The food was ok. Service was slow. Ordered vermicelli with beef and chicken. Had a very strong vingar taste. My other vietnamese spots doesnt add vingar. Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"There are two pho restaurants at Midland and Finch, and it's quite debatable about which one  has the best quality. To be quite frank, I do not like Pho Vietnam, and I say this as a frequent patron of theirs. You may wonder why I even bother coming here so often. Well, it's only for the sole purpose of meeting up with my friends, many of whom live in close proximity to this restaurant.  Many of them prefer this one over Vietnamese Star (the one at the older plaza) and I contest to this opinion.  

Personally, the first pho I ever tried was from here. I ordered their regular beef pho, and it was a greasy concoction. I had heard many  raving reviews about pho, that it has a mouthwatering broth, tender meat, and soft (not soggy) noodles.  What I got here, however, was a broth cloudy with grease, meat with too much fat on it, and decent (but not phenomenal) noodles. It was not pleasant, and it misconstrued my perception of pho. I didn't try pho after this until a friend had reassured me that there were better ones served up north. We dined at a different restaurant near Finch station, where I actually had a very satisfying and delicious pho in comparison. I was saved. 

I tried their strawberry bubble tea instead of ordering their food recently. I thought it might lift my low regard for their culinary items. The drink tasted strongly of artificial strawberry flavouring. Yep, it's a no-go. 

You have to be careful of their hygienic practices and their storage of ingredients as well. Recently, my friend received a pho with strips of meat that had very distinct,  blue streaks in them. I talked to the server and told him that we did not feel safe having him eat the meat and that we wanted them to remake the dish. I was very surprised when the server tried to disagree, arguing that he should still eat it because they ensure that all ingredients are above safety standards. He had no logical reasoning for why the meat had blue streaks in it. Persistent as always, I asked for a replacement again and the server reluctantly gave in.  What they gave, unfortunately, was not a newly made meal. They simply took out the meat slices and gave back the dish to our table.  Shocking, right? 

I do not recommend anyone to eat here, and it is with grave honesty because you may become ill after eating here."}
{"text":"Just good old pho. Better than most other places but doesn't stand out too much. If you want good pho this is the spot"}
{"text":"Went here with some co-workers for lunch a couple weeks ago. Large restaurant, that seems fairly well frequented. I ordered the grilled beef pho but asked for sate broth. The beef came separate from the rest of the dish as it had to be grilled first. I enjoyed the sate broth. As much as I have come to enjoy pho, I find that I have never come across a broth that hits my desired level of spiciness. I really like that they have the option of a small size. Sometimes I just don't want to share my pho, but I don't want a size that is too big for just one person. So that option of a small size is really great. Service seems hit and miss. At times the servers seemed to be around a lot, and then all of sudden it was like they were abducted, never to be seen again. I also ordered an avocado milkshake, and it was so good! If nothing else, I will definitely be popping by again for the shakes."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend, we both went to check this place out as it was pretty close-by and I was looking for a new pho place to try out!

Pho Vietnam is located in the back of the new plaza on Midland and Finch area~

We were seated pretty quickly and in the middle. With high ceilings, it made the restaurant look huge and these lantern-inspired lights were a pretty nice sight to see, from above.

We came around lunch time and there were tons of office people there because they were all dressed up in office wear and came in groups within the plaza.

My friend ordered the typical Pho, with thin vermicelli noodles. & I ordered the Pho Thai Lan, as I didn't want regular Pho. The Pho Thai Lan came with meatball, rare beef, tendon, tripe, brisket, with Tom Yum sauce. The Tom Yum sauce which really intrigued me, so I decided to go for it with thick rice noodles.

Apparently there were two options for noodles - thick rice noodles, or thin vermicelli noodles. Though it didn't say anywhere in the menu, the lady who served us (who barely spoke English) asked us what type of noodle we wanted and we were confused for a second...

At first glance, my Pho Thai Lan looked amazing! But as I mixed my noodles and beef to let it cook, there wasn't a lot to begin with. My friend also got a small portion when mixing the noodles.

My friend absolutely had the worst - the soup wasn't even hot enough to cook the beef even after leaving at the bottom for awhile. It still came out pinkish, which was SUCH a disappointment for a pho place!!!

For my dish, the Tom Yum base didn't taste anything much except for a slightly spicy pho soup. Luckily my beef managed to cook unlike my friend's.

With this, we were utterly disappointed and was NOT full after the meal. We actually made the trip to McDonald's after to fill our stomachs.

Small portion, soup not hot enough to cook beef & left feeling super unsatisfied!!!
Definitely one of the worst pho places I've ever been to and will definitely not be back!"}
{"text":"A bright, spacious, modern pho place at the very back of the new plaza on Midland and Finch. 

Decided to satisfy my craving of pho by getting a P1, small, which is basically the house special with all the different types of meat included. The pho tastes pretty good, I really like the broth and it's such a good fit of a meal for a cold day (or a hot day too if youre pho crazy like me)

I also ordered an avocado milkshake which was absolutely delicioussss; super creamy, not too sweet and super refreshing on a hot day. 

Overall, I recommend this place to anyone looking to try out a clean, modern, delicious pho restaurant in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Pretty good! This place was very clean and modern. I had the P1 pho and it was quite good. Broth was nice and ingredients were very fresh. They also gave us this chilli oil that went very well with the soup. 

I would come back and try their other items!"}
{"text":"OK, Disclaimer: I have been there only once for a take out lunch.  

I had called in advance and was initially pleased to see my order ready.  Coincidentally the place was being inspected for Liscencing. I paid and was going to leave when they offered to \"check\" my order.  It turned out, they assumed I was going to go home and cook the Veggies to put in my Pho!!  I explained I was taking it to work and will need utensils as well.  Another 10 minutes and I had to ask if the order is now ready.  I took my Pho/Tom Yum - shrimp okra with me.  $10.50 small. I couldn't believe how sweet sour (too sweet and salty) and how uncooked the okra were. I had a stomach ache an hour after. I only ate half and threw the rest. Did I mention there were 3/4 shrimp and ZERO noodles!  It was only my second time I had Vietnamese food so I figured it was how it was supposed to be.  I was dissappointed...  I must say the place looks nice and the service may have been fast had they not forgotten to cook the Veggies...  I had another experience of Pho,  way cheaper and generous and delicious (after I added the hot sauce they provide.)!  I will review that in a bit..."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Came in at 9:00 when they close at 11pm and the guy that served my family was rude. Seated us at a table that still had plates of food on it and when we asked to be seated at the other clean tables he said those tables were closed. He cleaned the table like a maniac causing all the food on the table to fly everywhere. When I asked if he could wipe down the chair as someone spilled a drink on it he looked annoyed and switched the chairs. Food was okay, definitely had better. He was pacing back and forth but we could never get his attention. When it came for time to pay the bill we had the cash already out and he could see that but didn't care to wait 2 seconds for us to put the money on the tray he handed us. I had to bring it back up to him to receive change. Not friendly, not efficient, and definitely not a must have. Try Bong Lua if you want good food and a good experience (YAY to family owned restaurants that care about their customers)"}
{"text":"More like a 4.5 but since we can't do half marks I'll round up since I do really like this place. 

Everything I've tried here is quite good, I've tried the beef pho, chicken pho, bun bo hue and avocado shake. The only reason I don't give it a 5/5 is because I've been to places that are even tastier. The taste of the broth here is more authentic than many I've been to, the soup never tasted fake unlike some pho joints in town.

Lastly I really want to commence them on their hygiene, and clean and comfortable atmosphere. The washrooms are clean and not dingy.. and they even wrap their forks that are out on the tables in napkins. The little things! 

Anyways give this place a try if you're in the area :) it's one of my favorite pho places in Scarborough"}
{"text":"If there was no star that's what I'll give them. We had 4 people and they had a table for 6. They wanted us to wait for a table for 4 and that's the only table left. What a joke!!!! We walked out and never went back again. The owner should realize how crazy to do business that way."}
{"text":"My Vietnamese friend brought me here under the premise that this was one of the best, if not the best, Vietnamese places in Toronto. She was not exaggerating. 

The food:
- bun bo hue: really different (in a good way) from all the bun bo hue's I've had in the past. Super generous portions of higher quality meat. It even has trotter! A lot of Vietnamese places seemed to taken them out of their bun bu hue's (someone told me it is really difficult to clean). The broth is flavourful without that overwhelming MSG feel. If I was Vietnamese, this is the type of dish that I imagine my Vietnamese grandma would make me. 
- caramel flan: my first time having a flan (or having flan?) It was quite enjoyable though, not overwhelmingly sweet like I find most desserts.

May I also add that it is probably the nicest looking Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. Not that I am a stickler for decor, as the way to my five star heart is through my stomach...but just a tip if you're in the mood to be fancy for pho."}
{"text":"This Place is amazing 
Been here a couple of times and had the raw beef pho and the BBQ pork pho 
Would recommend  to get small or medium bow because they are huge."}
{"text":"This place wasn't amazing when I came here a few years ago when the plaza was new. That hasn't changed. For it's price point, the bun bo hue doesn't compare to many others I've tried. At $10 for a bowl of broth with barely any kick, and chewy tough pork, I think I'd rather go elsewhere. The base broth is greatly pork flavoured which is where this place earned stars. If I came back, I'd try one of the rare beef phos to take in the full flavour of the broth."}
{"text":"This was a perfect pho day. Rainy...Sunday, and we've driven by this place a few times.

Service was quick but not pushy. We had the fried spring roll and two shakes...mango and jackfruit. I actually never had jackfruit before but it was absolutely delicious! Thick and refreshing! 

The Pho has amazing broth and was delicious as well. I had the small because I know anything bigger would be too much. It's the perfect size and I'm full.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place has become one of my favourite pho places north of Toronto. The soup broth is delicious and does not taste like MSG when compared to Train or Pho 88. They have fresh noodle and dry noodle; although the fresh noodle is really good, I prefer the dry as it is thinner. 

They also have a vegetarian menu which is great for me. I used to eat plain pho and couldn't eat the fried spring rolls but now I can with their menu!"}
{"text":"We go for pho like once a week! Especially when it's cold out. Pho spots aren't exactly known for their nice atmosphere, but this one is quite nice inside so fun for a nice night, good food or hanging out with some friends.  We got fried rice, thai noodles, fried soft crab, chicken wings and pho. Shakes taste great too! Avocado, coconut, sour sop, strawberry even. I usually get dehydrated after pho, but this place tastes good without being too salty. Def try it out!! Would have been 5 stars but the service leaves something to be desired, had to ask for plates/bowls, ask for more tea, ask for water, ask them to clear some plates, makes you feel a littlr annoyed."}
{"text":"I think I found my new favourite local vietnamese restaurant! The soup is flavourful without being greasy and the pho noodles the perfect al dente texture. Meat is fresh, tender and delicious. Attentive service, sunny interior and ample parking make this place even more attractive and enjoyable. 

For pho, you can choose to have fresh or dried noodles. I opted for the dried noodles both times and really enjoyed it. Also ordered crispy noodles for my kids which had a lot of meat, seafood and vegetables on top. The fried noodles were different from the ones at Cantonese places (slightly thicker and more spongy) but still yummy. Other dishes that were ordered at my table looked yummy-- can't wait to try more!

I used to go to pho88 at warden and steeles but started to find the cafeteria style a bit off-putting. They are fast and efficient to be sure but the tables seemed not-so-clean and with the kids factor, we stopped going. This place is definitely cleaner and more modern in decor.

They serve a variety of desserts and Vietnamese drinks. The bathrooms are clean. Extra charges for debit (.25) or credit card payments (.50) less than $10.

Half the tables have benches instead of chairs so big winter coats can cause a problem. In this cold winter weather the place also tends to be a bit cold, so tables away from the door are preferable."}
{"text":"I like the cleanliness of the restaurant, it's quite updated in it's furnishings. I ordered the vermicelli and BF ordered the everything pho. 

Although his pho did not come with a lot of meat my BF really liked the broth. We both noticed that the broth is quite clear. Which is different because usually the broth at other places are kind of cloudy and oily. The only thing that would make their pho better would be more meat. Seriously, common...gotta give some more meat for a medium. 

My vermicelli was good I am a fan of the thicker noodles, but this came with the really thin noodles which is good. The chicken was good but the portion did not match the portion of the salad and noodles. I was pretty much eating the salad with noodles because the chicken portion was small.

Overall, will come here because it's closer to me. Just would like to have a bit more meat. (that's what she said)"}
{"text":"I can definitely see why this place gets such a high rating.
The place is at the very end of the 2nd plaza after finch and midland and there's not really any other highly popular competing restaurant- therefore, amazing parking. AND, no fighting with stupid drivers like the plazas surrounding it. The interior is modern and clean, and the worker is very fluent in english.

The prices are pretty steep right off the bat- a large pho is around $10. I was like \"this better be the best pho in the world\". The bean sprouts and herbs were super fresh- how can I tell? The minty pungent smell was overwhelming to the point where I had to give the plate back after a few min (I don't put the veggies in anyway). The pho came and the broth was the clearest, freshest and cleanest broth I've ever tasted. So, THIS is how pho broth is trying to taste like! It was so clear and had no random oils like every other place does. The noodles were mediocre, even though I got the fresh noodles. Didn't really taste a difference. The beef came rare but it wasn't super juicy or amazing. 
I also had a durian milkshake, which was standard but still really good!

It was nice trying here, after seeing all the good reviews. Maybe I'll come here once in awhile.."}
{"text":"Food was good but there were flies hovering over us and our food while mosquitoes were feasting on our legs.  When we informed management about this, they said that flies come in the door when customers come in, like this is a normal thing in restaurants! We spent most of our meal swatting flies and trying to defend our legs from mosquitoes. My husband's ankles were still swollen from the mosquito bites nine hours after. We'd think twice about going back to this location!"}
{"text":"This place has lovely interior decor!

Pho #1 House special - beef, tripe, beef balls, tendon
NOODLES: not as thin as I'd like them but has a good texture, and isn't overcooked
BROTH:: very clear, little fat, flavourful, and most importantly doesn't have those disgusting soapy bubbles that a lot of those other pho places have
MEAT: beef was a little gamey, but tendon and tripe were PLENTIFUL I've never seen 6 cubes of tendon in a bowl before.

Rice wrapped shrimp - tastes fresh. shrimp was great. has slight minty flavour, the sauce was garlicky and sweet"}
{"text":"For the price of their pho, their portion size is small compared to other pho places. It's quite expensive. The soup is okay and I found the noodles kind of hard. 

Parking is very limited here and you'll often find yourself waiting for a spot during lunch and dinner time."}
{"text":"I have never in my life been to a place with such rude people, I mean like straight bluntly RUDE! This place gets a 1 star. Because  the ONLY thing that is good about this place is the soup, the broth... that's it. They are such disgusting hosts and really make you feel like a burden as a customer. Every time I go I tell myself to give it a chance .... I been there over 10 times... that's a lot of chances ... they really know how to ruin your appetite."}
{"text":"This is our go to pho place. The pho is really good, beef is high quality and the spring rolls are nice and crispy. What else can you ask for? The interior is also nice compared to most pho places."}
{"text":"This is the number 1 pho place I have ever been. The servers here are very welcoming and the decor inside is beautiful. 

The food is very good and comes out rather quick as well. I always try to come here for pho when I can. 

10/10"}
{"text":"Love the satay soup base here, free to sub in too! Spring rolls are also good. Fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????d,?????d.??????????????????????????????lunch/dinner?????????????"}
{"text":"We came to this place a lot in the past because the pho here was better than the one in the next plaza, but not as good as the other ones a couple blocks down. But recently they changed their direction of how they treat their customers. First they hired some rude ass waitress and then they started telling us their wifi is not for customers anymore(when it always was). On our last visit, we ordered the grill chicken rice for 10.99 and when it came the piece of chicken was so small and the rest was just way too much rice. When I asked the waitress about it, they just said that's just how it comes. Now we ordered this before and was never like this. I would've gotten more meat if i had went and ordered a roast pork rice at a Bbq place for half the price. We will probably never go back to this place!"}
{"text":"Came to this place on a Sunday afternoon for lunch, and this place is easily one of the best Pho restaurants in Scarborough. Servers were friendly, service was fast, the food was hot and fresh, and prices were still decent despite the price increase as of late. I ordered their P17 (brisket, beef balls, and rice noodles), and it tasted amazing when mixed with hoisin sauce and sriracha sauce.

Overall i'd give this place a 4/5. :)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, the food is good but the prices while not high are not cheap.  If you are reading this while you are nearby and want of Vietnamese food I would say give them a shot."}
{"text":"Smack nearly equidistant between Lawrence and Ellesmere, Pho Vietnam is an unavoidable sight amongst the cluttered commercial wasteland of Kennedy Road. I always find the catchy facade, with the steamy bowl of O in \"Pho\", funny whenever I pass by it. But that whimsical sign was enough to pull me in as I drove by looking for a place to eat something quick on the way home from being way too far east.

Spacious, modern, and with clean washrooms, Pho Vietnam looked respectable enough. The food: typical Viet comfort grub. My bowl of good ol' pho was not something to remember, but nothing to complain about it either. The summer rolls were well-put together and fresh.

The service tends to be more on the clueless and ignorant side, with staff who took 5 minutes to fill water, or don't even realize you just left the building. But what really didn't impressed me was that the level of detail that seemed to be evident in their interior decor did not extend to the menu they hand you. Mine had pictures of their various meals in the back, which was useful for helping introduce my accompanying friend to the world of Viet cuisine that lies beyond, well, the all-familiar bowl of pho. My friend complained that his menu did not come with the photographs. Like, c'mon!

Meh. For the price and ambiance, I much prefer the familiar downtown pho houses, though I'm sure there are also better such places in Scarborough. At least I can now say I have ate at that Pho Vietnam place with the funny sign.

{TTC: the 43 Kennedy to Shropshire. If you are unable to find the place with the catchy sign, you are a miserable failure.}"}
{"text":"This place is definitely my go-to pho/vietnamese restaurant. I recommend the rare beef pho, or the grilled beef and rice (c10). If you haven't tried any of the rice dishes at this place yet, try C10. You'll thank me later"}
{"text":"Fast service. Friendly? It's a Vietnamese place so don't expect to start a conversation with your server. Everything was satisfactory with taste, service and price. If you're in the area it would be a place to go if you're craving pho."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: very modern, pretty, clean, its the best thing about this place

Food: 
Banh Beo Bi: Not very fresh, i prefer Kennedy's location much better, came with a little \"bi' (shredded pork skin), 2/5

Overall: Ill be back, my friends and family prefer this location because of its layout and atompshere."}
{"text":"I waited 30 minutes for 6 spring rolls to take out and there was only 6 customers inside the restaurant. Service sucks !"}
{"text":"This is a pretty nice pho place. It's where my friends and I currently go when we are in Scarborough. The pho is pretty good. The restaurants decor is pretty snazzy for a pho place."}
{"text":"This is not my favorite pho restaurant by far. Came here on a late night dinner run as it was the only pho spot open past 10 in the area. I ordered the lamb congee soup and when it arrived it was nothing like the congee soup I've had at other places. It had lamb bones taking up half the bowl and came with a questionable plate of shredded cabbage like vegetables but it wasn't cabbage. I attempted to eat it but had a hard time swallowing it after 2 spoonfuls. I asked the server if there was anything we could do as I could not stomach my order and I was still hungry. His unsympathetic response that nothing could be done turned me off of ordering anything more off the menu. 
I will definitely not be returning and would not recommend this place even to a stranger. If you're in the mood for Asian food and it happens to be late night.. Don't let this spot be an option. Unappetizing and unempathetic hosting."}
{"text":"My wife is Vietnamese and is very picky about her restaurants.  We love this place.  One of the only places in Toronto area we eat Viet.  The workers and owners are Viet and the food is awesome.  love the softshell crab  - get it on vermicelli.  For Pho they offer 2 types of noodles,  dried and fresh. I love the fresh noodles. They're a bit wider but they're awesome."}
{"text":"First impressions of this place..

Parking is very limited, the restaurant has a big display of their name though, which is very nice.

A normal pho restaurant, nothing really special.

The waiter was really slow, forgot about our drinks and was not friendly.

The staff \"seemed\" busy but really they had more staff than customers, so I expected a lot more.

The pho was really good and made up for the issues but at the most 3/5."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Pretty clean and modern space. 

Ordered small bowl of pho ($7.50) with rare beef and flank
- Flank is so thin and tender with some fat!
- Wish the rare beef was thinner, a bit tough
(Also tried some of the cooked beef which is like the flank but with more fat!)
- Choice of dry/fresh and thin/thick noodles - great dry thin noodle!
- Broth was okay

Also got Deep Fried Spring Rolls to share. A bit of an oily taste but packed with loads of taro and pork."}
{"text":"My first experience at this restaurant was pretty good. I had the Banh Xeo which was delicious with a strong coconut flavor. It's hard to find this dish in Vietnamese restaurants uptown. 

I now frequent this place every week and can honestly say this is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Scarborough. It's clean, and actually authentic Vietnamese food unlike the Chinese owned places nearby. I usually have the pho, banh cuon, spring rolls, bun (vermicelli) or rice dishes. The fresh fruit smoothies are also good.

The only complaint that I have is that it closes too early. A lot of times at night when I want to eat quality Vietnamese food, it's already closed at 10pm."}
{"text":"Really quick service. Fresh ingredients and friendly staff. A favourite place for lunch on a cold winters' day."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch. The restaurant is well designed compared to your average no-frills basic Vietnamese joint. They were not very busy and my server was very quick and attentive. The food was prepared very fast. I had only went to the washroom for a few minutes and my bowl of pho was already at my table when I came back.

I ordered a large bowl of pho and it was more than enough to satisfy my hunger. Probably order a medium if you don't want to feel bloated afterwards. The broth was clear and flavourful with a decent amount of toppings (flank, tripe, tendon). Bonus: they serve fresh noodles here which made me very happy since most places use the dry ones only. Would come here again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about, but decent enough that I would come back.

Had their brisket and beef ball pho which was standard, and some grilled chicken fresh rolls which were alright too. Comes with a lot of dipping sauce. 

Also had an avocado milkshake. Took a while for it to come out, I was almost done my meal, but there were 2 other different flavoured shakes ordered at our table so that was probably the reason. They probably only had one blender."}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative reviews for this place, I really like the pho and in terms of customer service I have never had an issue. The best thing about this place is the actual noodles they use. It has a great chewy texture. The broth has good flavour and it is good value. Also the fresh shrimp roll had tons of filling including different herbs. It is on my regular rotation of pho places."}
{"text":"This is a typical pho restaurant with typical pricing. Overall, cheap and delicious.
The atmosphere was good, it is nice and spacious. The washrooms are actually CLEAN. Service was not bad, the waiter/waitress will be there once you wave. 

We usually order the shrimp roll to start, and each of us usually order some sort of  pho. 

The shrimp roll are always nice and fresh, the peanut sauce is also very yummy. There's nothing too special about the pho, but definitely good quantity for the pricing.

I've been back to this location for quite some times, and I've noticed that recently the quality of one of my favourite noodle soup (My Tho Style Noodle Soup?...don't remember the spelling) has went down. It used to serve quite a bit of seafood along with meat and a real crab claw. Now it just serves lots of meat, with barely any seafood and some pig liver. Can't really argue with the price though, they have to cut down cost somewhere...

Overall, decent quality and quantity of food for the price. Recommended."}
{"text":"My date really loved the Hai-nam chicken. I tried her rice and it was the bomb! It had something in it that made it so tasty and yummy. It was some kind of seasoning or garlic. Delicious! She really loved the food and so I am giving this place 4 stars because she rarely mentions that she likes something that much. Decor is nice but some of the single tables feel a bit cramped. Service was fast and efficient. Plenty of parking but horrible plaza to get into. 4 stars ****"}

Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we're javing today. Today we are trying their pork chop rice with shredded pork, steamed egg, and fried egg! Woah that's a lot of food! Let's dive right into the food (and review).

The dish was so well presented I was reluctant to start eating. First off, the fried egg was still runny, allowing the rice to soak up the yolk; just the way I like it. The steamed egg on the other hand did not taste particularly great. The pork chop was well seasoned but wasn't as tender as I would have liked. 

Not much to say about their service. It was relatively standard but the employees are always friendly here.

Their pricing is what you would normally expect at a pho place.

In conclusion I had a typical pho experience but would probably consider this one of the better pho places I've had in Scarborough-markham area. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember that food is life!"}
{"text":"Apparently, the pho is supposed to have an 'authentic taste' if we had it with dried noodles.  Tried it with dried noodles this time and found the soup too bland to us.  The pork chop rice was really really good though, as well as the curry & spring rolls.  I would definitely come back for the other food, but probably not for the pho.  Overall good food, but super busy on weekend nights.  We were lucky to get a big table before others came"}
{"text":"How is it that I haven't written a review for this place???  Well, maybe it's because it's one of those place you visit our of obligation.  My parents love coming here when they come to visit.  I am not sure why since what they serve up is really very average.  Sure, it's better than my local pho saigon (Pickering location) and closer than my favorite Pho Metro (Scarborough location).  

I've tried most of their phos and some spring rolls.  The food isn't bad but it's nothing I will go our of my way to eat.  Their midland ave location is much better as the parking is more convenient and seating can be more comfortable if you're a large group.  

I'll probably continue to eat here at my parents' request but if you want really good pho, just drive the extra 15 min west and go to Pho Metro."}
{"text":"Tucked all the way back in the restaurant packed plaza, this Pho Vietnam was a welcome find.  The decor and the setting (including ample parking) is much more comfortable than its sister location on Kennedy but with the same good food.

We ordered a small rare beef and flank pho, medium sate pho and an order of fresh rolls.  The small here is really a small and the medium for an extra $1 definitely seemed worth it.  

Both phos were flavourful with rich broth and good cuts of meat.  I also liked that we had an option to choose between fresh or dried noodles.  The fresh rolls were good also.  

It was hard to dislike Pho Vietnam on Kennedy except its parking nightmare but now that I've found this location, I think this one would be my go to spot for Pho in the area.  Yay!"}
{"text":"We came on a late Friday evening. The ambiance is above average for a pho restaurant with modern decor and was very well lit. The servers were friendly and attentive. For the 3 of us, we got the \"pho dac biet\" (special pho) and the  \"com ga roti nuoc dua\" (coconut roasted chicken on rice) to share. For the pho, we were given the choice of either dry or fresh noodles. We went with the fresh noodles. However, the texture of the noodles were terrible! They were rock hard and gritty. It seemed as if the noodles were refrigerated for days. The broth was mediocre, nothing special. For the coconut chicken on rice, we weren't really able to taste the coconut from the chicken."}
{"text":"A large bowl of pho on a cold winter day. Perfect comfort food. This is an authentic Vietnamese run pho restaurant. Portions are fair and you do get a lot of meat but still none have reached the standards in terms of portion and quality that I'm use to at Pho 88. I think this place needs to add an extra large category for bottomless eaters like me. I also got a deep fried soft shell crab for $11.99 as an appetizer. The flavor of the batter was pretty good and it was nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside but it didn't have much crab flavor. Even so I would still order it again in a heart beat. Great to have another pho restaurant in the area.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"This one is much better than the Kennedy location. The pho was really good and the amount of beef and tripe I got exceeded my expectations. Every time I dig for more meat at the bottom of the bowl there would always be more. I also got the deep fried soft shell crab again but this time it didn't come out that great. The soft shell crab wasn't all that soft. It was already starting to develop a shell so it felt like it had a plastic layer on the crab. I'm gonna stay away from this appetizer from now on and stick with the usual deep fried spring rolls. Overall this place is newer, nicer and has a whole lot of meat in their pho."}
{"text":"The prices are good, the portions are decent & the food is either good or bland. The atmosphere is really nice though. I normally get vermicelli at a pho restaurant & honestly it's nothing special. The pho is good though, not too salty or heavy. 

Today I tried the avocado shake & it was probably one of the worst I've had. The avocado flavour was faint & tasted like eating ice. It was only $4.50 though & cup was huge in comparison to a small bubble tea that would be the same price or more. I genuinely didn't enjoy it. I wouldn't try the other shakes, that's for sure."}
{"text":"My favorite pho place to go! :) love their pho with just the brisket, their vermicelli with fish sauce is also delicious and their spring rolls are absolutely amazing! Always fresh and appetizing!"}
{"text":"*Edited on 11/20/17*

I had to edit this review. Over the past year or more I've noticed a decline in quality and quantity. They have been consistently inconsistent with their meat portion sizes and lacking in freshness. It's gotten to the point where I don't go anymore; however, I recently ended up there and was reminded of how poor it became. I occasionally go to their Midland & Finch location. It's better there. 


Originally Reviewed 10/13/15 - 4/5 stars

This is my go-to spot for when I have a pho craving. The staff are always welcoming and courteous. The place is clean with ample seating and fast service. I find the food here consistently good. The pho broth itself is very tasty. It's aromatic and light and not greasy/oily or heavy like pho broths I've noticed at other restaurants. I personally love vermicelli the best. B11 beef all the way! :d I especially like the noodles they use (nice taste and texture). Oh and you can't forget to add a smoothie to the mix. I've tried (and enjoyed) the mango, jackfruit and avocado smoothies. The only con to this place is the parking if the joint is full, otherwise I think it's pho-kin great! ;)"}
{"text":"My all time favourite pho place ! 
Place very bright and spacious, servers are very friendly
The broth is flavourful, and the meat is just the right portion, but noodles is a bit too little
Medium is just the right size
P.s Mango juice is so good !"}
{"text":"Not sure where all the good reviews are coming from. I dined here tonight for dinner and ordered the B11 which is vermicelli with spring rolls and choice of grilled beef, chicken or pork. When it arrived it looked good but sadly I was disappointed. The sauce was flavorless and lacked any taste - I personally felt it was watered down. I was not impressed. 

On top of that we received lukewarm water when we asked for ice water. I also noticed one of the employees was picking their nose then went to clean the tables. Pretty sure that's not sanitary at all. I felt disgusted and even questioned the food I put in my mouth. I left more than 3/4 of my meal at the restaurant. 

When we tried to ask for the bill, the employees were too busy cleaning and chatting among themselves. It took awhile for us to get the bill and we definitely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"So this place is tucked away around midland and finch! Heck this place broth is deeeeeeeeeee licious hmm hmm hmm. The price though is quite pricey then other pho places. . Small is 6.50 medium is 7.50 large is 9.99 or 8.99 and most of the other dishes are 10.99. 

This place is not bad though the staff is really friendly and very English proficient."}
{"text":"Had my fave B11 Chicken and an extra 2 fried spring rolls fr lunch yesterday.  My brother introduced me to this place and it's a great restaurant for all your Vietnamese dishes.  Decor is fresh and clean and so are the washrooms (which is a nice change) from the usual gross grundgy - bland decor Viet restos!  Portion sizes are very large.  Service is quick and cheerful and a place I frequent when I want a good Bun or Pho!"}
{"text":"Meh. I ordered a medium dry noodle with beef balls and cooked beef tendon. What came was beef balls and cooked beef. I always order no greens. But they also took away my onions. Broth was tasty meet balls were a bit smaller and tough. 

Would come back. For a medium it's $8.50 not too bad. Seems clean enough. Servers aren't the most friendly but expected at these locations."}
{"text":"Definitely not coming back for the pho

The good:
-they offer small, medium and large pho sizes 
-clean restaurant 
-they offer fresh noodles 

The bad:
-SLOW service
-mediocre pho (it had a weird smell, I don't like the chicken they use for pho gat but the soup doesn't seem to msg-heavy so I'll give them that) 

I had a bad dining experience because the staff were slow af. We asked for cooked bean sprouts and they kept saying it was cooked when it clearly was not ... we waited almost an hour to get our food also which is UNHEARD OF for pho.. like come on, it's pho....... 

The rice dish we got (C6) was pretty good so maybe I'll give this place another try..."}
{"text":"I found the noodles to be a little bit too raw.

The taste of the soup was fine though"}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Pho Vietnam, from my records, is probably the last major pho restaurant I still haven't tried in Scarborough. Well, I decided to end that and try it this afternoon.

The interior looks extremely modern and quite nicely designed, I must admit. It looked like one of those bubble tea places setup (think Serissa Cafe). Definitely nothing like the rundown-ness you get in places like Kim Po.

I was greeted immediately and had a seat in one of the booths. Service for the entire time in the restaurant was excellent, and the server frequently came back to us asking if we wanted more tea.

I ordered the udon noodle soup with shrimp and crab meat, thinking that I would get the Vietnamese-style udon similar to Kim Po. However, to my disappointment, the udon was the low class Japanese kind you can get in grocery stores for $2 a pack. The broth actually tasted quite good, but I felt the need to down a lot of tea after the meal, which meant there was quite a lot of MSG in the broth (and I'm usually the last person to complain about MSG). Considering the price ($10.50), I didn't feel the price/quantity/quality ratio was worth it.

Kim Po continues to be the winner for Scarborough Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"I went to Pho Vietnam for lunch with friends few weeks ago. First when I walked into the restaurant. The staff greeting was friendly. We took some time to look over the menu to see what we would like to try out. My friend and I got their signature noodles. After 5-10 mins waiting, my the food to came. It seems like a fast efficient service. The soup was good and has a strong taste (fresh). You can choose your option fresh or cook bean spouts. If you are in the area, you can try it out and tell me your experience there."}
{"text":"I do not understand the good reviews this place has gotten. This place has horrible service, the portion size is especially stingy, and the FOOD IS NOT CLEAN. 

The servers here are so rude, I remember asking to be seated at a slightly bigger table (the store was practically empty) and the server denied me, saying the number of customers should correspond to the number of seats at a table! The store wasn't even busy! But regardless, my family made the decision to stay and we ended up ordering appetizers along with our mains. Our mains somehow came before our appetizers, and my brother's dish came last (after the appetizers and when everybody has finished their food). Before that, we've ask the servers multiple times, when my brother's food is going to arrive, but they brushed us off every time! We ended up packing my brother's food to go because we wanted to get the hell out of there. Here's the best part, when we got home and my brother opened his takeout, he found a cockroach in his salad! I am never coming back here again, this place is so dirty."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places for pho. The decor is alright and the resturant is quite spacious. As for the service, it could be great some days, and not so much on others; it really depends on your server. The pho, though, is definitely amongst my top 3 in the GTA. Located at the end of the plaza, parking is easy to find. The plaza is filled with other restaurants, including bbt and dessert shops, which makes it very convenient for snacks and drinks after your pho meal.

I always get the Satay Pho with dry noodles (thinner noodles), and I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a little bit of spice in their pho.  

Beware though - this place doesn't accept card if your total is under $10 before tax; though it'd be very hard to not spend over $10 anyway."}
{"text":"Just went here for brunch with family today. I had fried spring rolls and pho, the first one on their menu that has about everything. The flavour was good. 
They need smarter staff however. I have met a lot of wait staff who can't speak 2 words of english but can pick up fast on what customers need if you tell them what you need directly. 

In here, it was difficult alone to ask for napkins. We got to the point of trying uttering just the single word \"napkin\" over and over and still it took a while for them to understand. This was not the only thing we had to ask for additionally due to a lot of miscommunication. The overall experience dining there was difficult."}
{"text":"My personal taste in Pho dictates Pho Vietnam as the best pho place in the Scarborough area. There are many other good pho joints in Scarborough, but Pho Vietnam brings together the best of eveything. Smooth and clear broth, firm and al dente (dry) noodles, good serving of meat. 

Always plenty of parking in a back corner of sky plaza. 

Serve time vary from time to time. Overall very solid restaurant. 

4/5 am always here."}
{"text":"Always passed by this place when going to XS cargo and all those shabby looking electronic stores, so I thought I give this place a try and I have to admit this is my last time going to this place. First going into this place, it was pretty clean until we got to our table, It was pretty filthy that I didnt even want to put my phone on the table...none the less after looking at the menu, are you kidding me $9 for a bowl of bun and $4.50 for a avocado milkshake?!??!?! talk about over priced for a place like this. Servers are pretty average size.

Tip: go find yourself a better pho place"}
{"text":"Pretty decent/standard pho place. I had the fresh rolls and vegetarian pho (lots of bok choy and tofu, beef broth because I'm not actually vegetarian but you can also get veggie broth) which were both tasty. My DC's had the beef balls/tripe and said it was good. Good portion size and the usual plate of basil, bean sprouts, lime on the side. 

We did not have any issues with the service. We were in and out for a weekday lunch in under 1 hour and all our dishes came out together. 

Nothing to write home about, but a good option if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"A solid pho restaurant in a neighbourhood filled with competitors. The interior is comfortable given the soaring ceiling but the chairs are a bit of an offset.

The food is good and they have options for dry noodles or regular noodles. Price point is average and overall it's a clean, comfortable venue with tasty food for when you have that pho craving."}

1/5 stars"}
{"text":"Updated review: after a few years of business this place has let itself go the pho is concentrated in msg and the wait staff are extremely rude now seems they have forgotten why customers even came in the first place"}
{"text":"Our go-to place for Pho.

The broth is good (not overly salty like some other places) and they give you a good amount of meat and noodles.  

The Vietnamese spring rolls are nice and crispy and a good size, too.

Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk is amazing.  They bring it to your table to brew so you can make it as strong as you like and you can add the ice yourself as well, to adjust the taste.

The service is quick and friendly and the price is right."}
{"text":"We come to this location for a quick pho fix very often. It is ran by very friendly Chinese/Vietnamese owners. We typically order the rare beef with noodles in soup and lemon grass chicken on rice. Something different at this pho restaurant is that you get to pick if you want \"fresh\" noodles or \"dry\" noodles. It is totally up to personally preference but nice to have that option. Their Large is a typical XL at other establishments.

The environment is good in a well lit open concept restaurant. The utensils are pretty clean for Scarborough standards and chairs/tables are clean. I would recommend this to others but again, it is just pho, nothing that will blow you out of the park kind of food."}
{"text":"My first time here. Made reservation for a big group of 17.

The service was good! tables were clean.

I ordered the large Pho p1, others ordered their own dishes.

My Pho was pretty good!! In quality and quantity!

The soup base was good, and it was filled with tendons, rare beef flank, etc....
I'm a fan, if it is always like this!!

Chicken wings looked good.

Nice comfortable restaurant with high ceilings!

The only negative is the washroom!  So dark there,  because they use pot lighting.  Never evee use pot lights in a bathroom!! It is hard lighting. When you are washing your hands, the pot lights are behind where you are standing, so you can't even see your face in the mirror- its too dark!! LOL.

Anyhow,

Food and service experience is 4.5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Adorable and quick. Have only tried the pho so not sure about the other items, but I'm sure they're good. This has become our go-to pho place."}
{"text":"My husband and I just returned to Toronto following a 23 month trip through Asia & Europe. We spent the bulk of those 2 years in Asia, and spent 5 months in total traveling and eating our way through Vietnam and we both consider Vietnamese food to be one of our favorite types of cuisine. We always said when we returned home that we wouldn't be those annoying people who eat international dishes and then scoff that it's \"so much better in country X\", but... here we are.

We visited Pho Vietnam last night with my parents to celebrate my dad's birthday. Given that we were going out for a special occasion, I really wish I could say something--anything--good about this place. If forced, I guess the price is reasonable for Toronto? $7 or $8 for a bowl of pho doesn't seem too outrageous for this city.

But honestly, you're better off just lighting that money on fire rather than eating anything at this restaurant. Between the four of us, we sampled summer rolls (goi cuon), a bowl of rare beef pho, a rice plate (com dia) with grilled pork, shredded pork, steamed egg omelet & fried egg, a vermicelli rice bowl with grilled pork & spring rolls (bun thit nuong cha gio) and a fried noodle dish that was described as Pad Thai. 

Nothing was remotely authentic whatsoever, and every dish had clearly been modified or watered down for western palates. The closest thing was probably the rolls, which came out with the correct dipping sauce, but unfortunately didn't include fresh mint or any herbs within them as they would always be served in Vietnam. Also, I personally think $10.50 for 4 rolls is insane. The pho came out with just one stalk of basil, and the broth was horribly imbalanced: tasted intensely of cinnamon but nothing else. This is not what pho is supposed to taste like and I've eaten it across the 3000km length of Vietnam. Rice place used the correct rice, but didn't come with nuoc cham sauce, the steamed egg omelet had weird imitation crab in it rather than noodles & pork, and the pork chop (despite looking promising) was utterly flavorless, its marinade clearly comprised predominantly of red food coloring and nothing else; the shredded pork component was good and tasted as it should. The vermicelli bowl, featuring grilled pork, was also bland and didn't involve any fresh herbs. The Pad Thai is obviously not Vietnamese, but certainly wasn't Thai either and tasted like it was using some kind of sweet & sour BBQ sauce.

Vietnamese food is supposed to be light & flavorful, which the food at Pho Vietnam most definitely is not. I suppose I would give it a pass for not being 100% authentic if it was at least tasty, but it isn't. Most of the components in every dish were bland and one-note. While we were there, the restaurant was packed, but not with a single Vietnamese person, which I'm not at all surprised to find. It's disappointing that this is either what is considered good Vietnamese food in Toronto, or that so many people seem to think this is good Vietnamese food. I assure you, it is not.

As others have noted, the service here isn't great. True, the place is busy, but the service is still haphazard and distracted -- we kept needing to ask for more herbs, and we were routinely given incorrect silverware based on our dishes. You never go to a Vietnamese restaurant expecting fantastic service, but this was so disorganized and poor that it certainly couldn't make up for the lackluster food. 

I've racked my brains trying to think of a single thing to redeem it, but just can't. Service is poor and the food is insultingly bad, so who cares if it's relatively cheap? The hunt for good Vietnamese food in the GTA continues, because this sure isn't it!"}
{"text":"Overall a decent place to go for a quick bite. Not the best, but not the worst. 

Pros: Nice décor. Clean restaurant. Attentive servers. Flat screen wall mounted TVs. 

Cons: Pho was small portioned and more expensive than other restaurants. Broth was very bland. Servers got orders mixed up and were flustered."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I really like the vermicelli with beef with a side of pork chops. Has been a favorite for years."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden and may be hard to find (its located all the way at the right end of the finch and midland plaza!) Atmosphere is very good here (bc of the high ceiling and modern decor) and service was good (they asked me what noodle I wanted - dry or fresh noodles!). Also the pho here was decent for a reasonable price level compared to other pho restaurants. A Medium size pho (I got the one with the beef tripe, rare beef and meatballs) for $8.50 is already very filling, but don't get the rice rolls w shrimp bc it tasted a little dry!!! However the broth was not that rich in flavour which made the entire thing very bland and dry. But overall its decent.

Hope this helps! :)"}
{"text":"Love the pho and Chicken curry here! Like the best curry I have ever tried in my life
I have tried several 4 star pho restaurants in Toronto and I have to say this place is still my fav one. The broth is delish and not as oily as other places, the assorted beef is tender(they give more beef than others), the avocado smoothie is fresh and refreshing!"}
{"text":"A great place for a quick inexpensive lunch. I use to work in old Montreal where there is no shortage of incredible restaurants to chose from but sometimes you need to get your Pho fix!

My Pho buddy Isabelle and I would make the ten or so minute walk to Pho Vietnam every few weeks. The service isn't 5 star or anything but for a quick lunch it's fine, in fact Isabelle and I got a quick from the lady who seems to own the place. She come off as a little grumpy when as we would order she said yea yea yea, like we were taking too long. I know it sounds annoying but really it just adds to the ambiance. 

The restaurant itself is small and a little crowded, your seated at long communal tables next to people you don't know but that adds to the charm. The place is clean, the food is tasty and the service fast yet quirky, all the makings of a good lunch spot!"}
{"text":"The fresh noodles option is a good selling point. Service was prompt and courteous. The soup, however, is lacking on flavors. Would give it a second try for the noodles."}
{"text":"The ambiance of the restaurant was pretty relaxing. The place was really pretty compared to the other Pho I have been to. My friend and I order the medium size P18 Pho Noodles ( I recommend if you eat very little, share it with your friend as they serve too big). We also ordered deep fried squid and the assorted fried rice, it was both really delicious. Overall, the food is very satisfying. However, they have really bad services. The waitress was always frowning when she serves food. I also asked for a serving spoon and she literally said that they don't have a spoon. I asked the other girl, and she gave a heavy spoon. Also, we nicely asked the waitress if we could have a plate for our fried rice and she literally say that the bowl they gave us was the plate. I'm like really? Fried rice on a bowl? Its really a bad experience for me and my friend. But nevertheles, we came there to eat"}
{"text":"My go to Pho place in scarborough. I usually get the small P1 with fresh noodles - it's under $10, comes with a great assortment of meat, and is always tasty. The only issue is that under $10 needs to be paid by cash which can be annoying. The appetizers are relatively costly compared to how much the main dishes are."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite place for Vietnamese food and I would definitely give it a 4*. However after visiting again the other day, I changed my mind.

Don't get me wrong, I still love their pho. It has a very clear and flavourful broth. I love how they offer two choices of noodles - dry or fresh.

We ordered fried spring rolls and fresh rolls. It was yummy and everything was good until we found a small piece of plastic inside the fried spring roll. You can see it in one of the pictures attached. 
After notifying the waiter, he said ok and quickly went away to tell the other waiters. I would at least expect an apology but he just came back and took away our spring roll without saying anything. 

We got a new roll of spring roll that's delivered by another waiter. He apologized. We got 10% off our bill to compensate for the inconvenience we experienced."}
{"text":"I have no complaints about the food. The pho is always yummy, with a good quantity of meat. Anytime I've ordered an appetizer, I've enjoyed it as well. 

Lately, the service has been really deficient. No napkins given, no refills on tea, and just a poor attitude by the waitresses.  After enduring this for my two most recent visits, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Just like another pho vietnam I've been to. Small portions for a more expensive pho. $7.50 for a small. 
Still, noodles were good and the restaurant is clean. Had the summer rolls and it was good, my fave!"}
{"text":"Their beef ball noodle soup is delicious! And the best part is that their beef balls don't have any cartilage in it! So its all pure beef. $7-8 

Their vermicelli is average. I like the one at pho 88 in bamburgh better. $10. The fish sauce wasn't the best.

The place doesn't smell so that's a plus. Service is great. And very clean!

Although a bit expensive, I'd come here for the freshness of the food and the lack of pho odour on my clothes."}
{"text":"We got take out from here on Sunday. Food is still good. I'm not sure why other people aren't having good experiences with the food. Every time we order food here it's been delicious. I will admit there was one dish I tried which I didn't like but I hadn't expected bamboo to be so smelly. Anyway, we will continue to order food from here."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time eating Pho and I was curious, excited and cautious. I ordered a small grilled beef pho (dried noodles). I added the basil, bean sprouts, 1 lime, a bit of spice and I loved it! I just love lime. And trying it with grilled beef was a smart choice. Others may feel comfortable with medium rare beef to cook in the pho, but I am not at that stage yet!

This place is located in a newer, open spaced industrial park. Industrial park is possible not the correct descriptor because all other business are restaurants (& a several fashion & jewelry outlets), but driving to find this pho place felt like driving through an industrial park given the wide open spaces.

The restaurant is bright, tall ceilings, clean with a bright decor."}
{"text":"Yay:
- the meat of the vermicelli was very well seasoned
- special items for vegetarians 
- plenty of parking and spacious 

Nay:
- nothing very special that stands out but everything is always good.
- no mun bean drink just the 3 mixed one


Was asked randomly in the car what's a good Pho place. Never really thought about it but this place their vermicelli dishes are pretty tasty. Their meats I would say is very well marinated with lemongrass and herbs. Super flavorful and moist compared to many other places. Could use a bit more noodles but that just getting picky..."}
{"text":"Tldr: good variety of viet dishes, pho broth tastes clean, decent price and good portions. Inconsistent freshness of ingredients and meat, terrible service 

Come here from time to time for my pho cravings. Like many other viet joints, this place also has a wide variety of vermicelli, pho, and rice dishes. Vegetarian options are available here as well.

What i like about the pho here is that the broth tastes a little bit more cleaner than other places. It doesn't leave a oily/fatty feel in your mouth after slurping some noodles. I personally enjoy the chewier texture in noodles, so i usually opt for the dry noodles for my pho. The price for the pho is decently priced and the portions are pretty good too. The spring rolls here are decent as well, but on the pricier end. 

The reason why i only come here occasionally is because i think the freshness of the ingredients are debatable at times. There was one time when i ordered the pho, the raw beef had a shiny dark blue tinge to it, and the overall colour of the beef was kind of grey. Now i understand that this might be some sort of chemical reaction that occurs naturally with the beef, and that it's still safe to eat. However, this also probably means how they store meat is not the greatest. Just observing an awkward colour on food that's not usually there really deterred an enjoyable dining experience for me.  

The service here is sub-par as well. The waiters are pretty rude and apathetic. Your food does come pretty quick (if you get the pho, rice takes longer), though i feel very rushed every time i eat here. On my last visit here with my friends, the moment we sat down the waiter asked us if we were ready to order... Like...Homie. You literally just saw us sitting down. Give us some time to decide what we want??

Overall, i would say this place is just ok. The food is not bad, but the service really changes the game. If you do decide to come here, don't expect much from the waiters."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants where you can't help but be conflicted. 

First the service was amazing. Our server was on top of tea, order placing, and serving other customers.

The interior is modern, extremely clean and spacious (no rubbing elbows with the customers next to you). 

I ordered the large P1, 2 grilled pork chops, and a small spring roll.  
The pho here was the major source of confliction:
The fact that the server asked if I preferred fresh or dry noodles just shocked me - as most stores have a take it or leave it mentality on whichever noodles they have on hand.  The soup for the pho was tasty when drank by itself - but lacked flavour when it came to be eaten with the noodles.  
The grilled pork chop had a sour after-flavour - I was surprised they didn't offer the usual pork chop, grilled chicken, and steamed egg combo.
The spring rolls were soooo good. The ingredients were fresh, it was tasty, and the roll was so crunchy and crisp.  BUT they were so damn expensive. $6 for a small spring roll?!

Overall, I appreciate this restaurant but I might not return as I wouldn't want to spend roughly $10 for every item I order."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. The first time was probably 3 years ago which i can't remember much about 

To start off the manager or \"owner\" has no customer service what so ever, and tries to make more money off of people lol by charging for unnecessary things for unnecessary prices. 

My table was of four, just before 7pm. It was getting kind of busy, not really. But anyways.. I ordered an avocado shake, and it came out looking like crushed ice. I'm not sure if a tint of green was even in it. I took a sip and could hardly get anything to come up the straw... So i kindly ask her if she can help me remake it just with less of whatever she put and actually more avocado. She goes and says \"we use natural products, the one i gave you was the biggest avocado, and we don't use powder or anything like other restaurants\" 
I never asked for her to explain what was in it. Or what she didn't use that \"other places do\" - so my ice shake was basically ice and milk. lol 

My grilled pork on rice came out. $1.50 for an egg that i wanted sunny side, but came out clearly cooked. The pork was OK. But too fat, and some parts weren't fully cooked. I asked for a bowl of soup to have on the dry pork lol.. And the waiter came back and told me the owner says charge me $3 for it. Wow ok. if i heard $1 or $1.50 okay whatever but $3? for a small bowl of MSG? lol you've got to be kidding me i might as well order another ICE shake you charge for over $3 

My cousin got a Pho with rare beef and beef balls, small size. & so did my aunt. They both came out with hardly any toppings hence the fact that one bowl preferred no greens while the other did, but yet they came out plain old jane, and looked very stingy as it was

My mom got the Bun bo hue. It took the longest but tasted the worst! How did that happen???!!! For $12+ a bowl it came very faint in colour, and tasteless. That bowl got probably 4 bites before it went to waste. 

The only good thing i can say about this place is that the waiter - he was nice. The spring rolls weren't bad. 

The pricing for that area; for that type of quality food is crap. The manager needs to stop being greedy and try and make customers actually wanna come back. 

Overly priced. Shitty food. Just drive a few kms to find better pho, and service. Don't recommend. Bye"}
{"text":"Honest not one of my go to places for pho. Even if you order a large bowl they only give you a little bit of meat and a whole lot of noodles. You get a choice of either dry or fresh noodles- opt for the fresh!! We got pho dac biet (house special) and pho tom yum. Pho tom yum is pretty good, taste like pho broth but with a kick of lemon and spice. 

Restaurants is clean, service is quick. Prices are a bit high for a bowl of pho, higher than places in the west end. Huge parking lot and restaurants got a lot of seats too."}
{"text":"The pho here is quite good! On a cold winter's night, this restaurant definitely hits the spot. Good, clean tasting broth. Selection of fresh or dry noodles (be cool, choose the fresh!). Updated decor, which lovely high ceilings and some funky lighting that makes the experience much less \"fast food\" than some pho places.

I ordered the medium P1 ($7.50) which is the special beef pho, and it came in a fairly large bowl.I love that they have S/M/L large choices, as some places only give you option for S/L. What if I'm HUNGRY BUT NOT THAT HUNGRY, HUH?? We also tried the spring rolls, which was $10.50 for a large plate, definitely large enough to share among 4 people!

Excellent place, will definintely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a week night. It was pretty empty at the time. So the service was quick, we ordered our food and it didnt take long for it to come out.  The decor and ambiance of the restaurant is pretty good. Different from your run of the mill pho restaurants. But i would say the food is just mediocre, nothing that really stands out to me.  This restaurant does have an advantage though, it is located in an up and coming strip mall in the midland and finch area.  So they will get a lot of foot traffic especially on the weekends.  If your looking for quick fix for your pho cravings, this place can fill that craving. Just dont expect it to blow your mind away."}
{"text":"I come here almost once a week because I just love pho! The restaurant is newly furnished, with hygienic utensils to make your overall experience pleasant.

I always get P1 medium (fresh noodles/ thick ones) which is under 10 bucks with tax and tips

Note: if you order small, it's REALLY small and not likely to satisfy your hunger

Note: you can only use debit/credit card if your spend more than 10 dollars before tax"}
{"text":"Been going here for years.

Soup is 3.
Price and proportion is 3. Too expensive for what you get.
Place and decor is 4.
Service is 4."}
{"text":"I had an order of the bun bo hue. The flavour was good but was not too authentic. The pig foot consisted more of meat rather than the juicy skin and tendon but was not a bad thing either. There was a shortage of noodles and meat and was not worth the bang for the buck. If you decide to order this dish, there is a 10 minute wait (which they state). The portion was weak and it costed me about $10 for a bowl.

The service was medicare. The servers would greet you and ask politely for what you would want but it took a while to get a server's attention because he was on his phone. Maybe because I came in an hour before closing and they were on shut down mode.

It's a friendly and warm environment. Everything was quite sanitary."}
{"text":"A friend of mine has an unhealthy obsession with Pho so I decided to tag along with him. He claims this was the \"best pho in scarborough\", for someone who eats pho almost every day, my expectations were quite high.

Because this is a brand new plaza, whoever designed the place didn't really think the signs through. The spots right outside of the restaurants clearly has lines to divide cars out for parking but yet there's a \"no parking, fire route\" sign..

I like my stinky food, so I tried the durian milkshake with extra durian. Most places are pretty cheap when it comes with the amount of fruit they put in but  the milkshake here taste like durian ice cream ! yum!

I tried the pork chop, steamed egg, fried egg, and shredded pork skin on rice along with a side of spring rolls. I had a rice dish the week before from green bamboo so I may be biased with comparing to my favorite place.  The pork chop came out bright pink. Not because it wasn't cooked but the marination. So pink it looked a little artificial... The meat was very tender,. I find lemongrass pork chops in most places are a little dry but they did a VERY good job. The steamed egg on the other hand, it was really small, and dark yellow with a tint of grey. It didn't look fresh at all. By the looks of it, could've sat in the fridge for at a week or 2."}
{"text":"Pho Vietnam is one of those unmemoriable place. It is not a place you going to recommend to your friends, nor a place that you will go out of your way to visit......

Me and my friend at first was planning to go to Pho Saigon but drove by Pho Vietnam with the tacky eye catching  facade. Since I have not been here before, so I decide to stop here for a quick lunch.

The interior is nice and clean. We ordered  the small Pho with rare beef ($5.99), Spring Roll and grilled chicken Banh ($7.50) and a shrimp summer rolls ($4.50).

The food arrived quickly the summer rolls are quite tasty and refreshing... an alternative to a fried spring roll as appeititizer. My pho was yes small... the rare beef are cooked beef and the noodles are the dried varieties. My friend' s grilled chicken I found it a little dried and bland.... the spring rolls though really tasty!

This is the only vietnamese restaurant I have been to that has fresh red chilli preserved in vinegar! I found that it is a little strange and I don't really enjoy the taste. 

The services are fast and cold... The wait staffs have the look that \"I wish I am somewhere else\".

They accepts all credit cards.

There are a lot of better Pho joint in the area which are more tasty and cheaper than what Pho Vietnam offer."}
{"text":"If you been to Pho Vietnam's Kennedy location, this is their newest location at Midland and Finch.

I been waiting for this restaurant to open for months since my Yelp friend told me about that... and finally it opens for business this week.

Brand new restaurant... everything so nice and clean.... love the high ceilings and the floor to ceiling windows!

Staffs are really polite... calling me madam? Seriously? 

Special Pho Medium ($7.50)
- the clear broth is well flavoured and steaming hot, hot enough for my raw bean sprout to be cooked
- extra points to the meat, especially the tendon so buttery tendon.  This is one of the few occasions I enjoyed the meat more than the noodle itself

I am glad that they have the \"elevator\" background music on quite loud as I can even hear myself slurping on the noodle....

10% Grand Opening Specials!"}
{"text":"Came here for their pho and left displeased.  
Their pho isn't the most authentic or really that good.  The best it has going for itself is that it's hot.  I've had better pho at places that charged much less with equally big portion sizes.
Their only redeeming quality is that you have a nicer place to dine at."}
{"text":"Rating = 2.5 stars

Bún bò Hu rice noodle is not even mildly spicy. It is big portion, though."}
{"text":"Had the standard pho, was pretty good. Not much else you can do to explain pho, that hasn't been said, just noodles and meat. Meat quality was good. Also tried the shrimp rolls, which had a delicious piece of meat hidden under it as well. What I liked most about this place was the interior, was spacious, much cleaner and not as crowded as other Pho spots in the area."}
{"text":"Best Pho place I've been.
Pho Vietnam is located in at the back of a newer plaza on Midland Ave. 

Pho here is really good. When ordering pho, you have the option of fresh or dried noodles. Fresh noodles are really good- MUST TRY. 

Chicken vermicelli was excellent. The chicken was filled with flavours and cooked properly. Comes with lettuce, cucumbers, picked radish and of course the chicken. 

Very modern decor and definitely one of the cleanest pho restaurants I've been to. 

Service: Typical asian service. However, when chicken was slightly burnt, they did not argue and immediately refire a new chicken. 

Overall: Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"This place is so much better than the other pho restaurant nearby in terms of everything that matters: food and service.

The servers are generally very friendly and are efficient at their jobs. The restaurant is kept quite clean, which is always a plus. 
I like the noodles and broth here, because it doesn't feel overly salty compared to other places I've been. Meat to noodle ratio is also good. 

No complaints from me."}
{"text":"Clean, bright interior with a really high ceiling. The big hanging lights were a really nice touch of decoration. All the servers were nice but a little hard to wave down.

Twice in three days, once with family and the next time with the boyfriend. Ordered pho both times and the quality remained consistent. Given the option of dry or fresh noodles, not sure what the difference was but the waitress said ones thick and the other thin. The soup was hot and flavourful, didn't look too greasy. The texture of the noodle was just right, the best part was the beef. The sliced beef and the beef balls had a great beef taste to it, didn't need any extra sauce. Both the deep fried spring rolls and the soft shell crabs were crispy, especially enjoy the taro pieces in the spring roll.

Overall, definitely coming back, the new go to pho place with the family."}
{"text":"As someone who's been to Vietnam and eats vietnamese food in NYC all the time this place was pretty on point..their crepes are the best. The skin was this and the minced pork was fresh. The Pho was quite delicious as well."}
{"text":"The pho was one of the best I have ever eaten. I love pho and have eaten many at different vietnamese pho restaurants. I had a medium pho and I had the rare beef , tripe, tendon . It came out fresh as you can see in the photo of the beanspouts and basil. The beanspouts were boiled too. The amount of beef and tripe and noodles in the pho was quite plenty compared to other pho restaurants I was actually full from a medium.   
Normally I get a large at other restaurants and I'm half full. The broth was delicious not a lot of oil compared to other pho places. Overall good clean pho. One of the best."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for pho and pad thai. Their dishes are very affordable and delicious, with good soup base for pho and ingredients are fairly fresh. They have a pretty good menu and the pho noodles are very soft and delicious. The pad thai is also very soft and tasty; not entirely a ketchup based dish and the meat complements the noodles well. I would say it is one of the better pad thai's I've ever tried. It does get busy on weekends but the service is quick."}
{"text":"If I had to describe this place in one word, it would be 'meh'. This place is surrounded by big commercial buildings, and I would think this  would be a good place for lunch for the employees. Also there's not many other pho places around here so I see why this place would get a lot of business. Came here craving for pho, I left kinda half satisfied. The broth was a bit too light for me, the portions were quite average, they didn't have culantro with their complimentary veggies nor my fav pickled hot peppers. The condensed milk coffee wasn't filtered properly so I had to avoid drinking all the way to the bottom of the cup. 6.5/10"}
