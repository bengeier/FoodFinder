{"text":"we came sunday nite around 8pm party of 7 people. great food good portions and good flavors, the hostess did a good job with a big smile, the problem was our server, a mature lady around 50's she didn't look so happy,no smile, no welcome, nothing. incomplete drink order, when taking our order she wasn't paying attention of what we ordered, (kind of like ignoring you) 'NO UP SELLING' after a our meal we had to ask her COUPLE OF TIMES if the service charge was included finally she just moved her head up and down with a dirty look. good food like always but service needs work."}
{"text":"My family and I frequent this restaurant.  Everything we have tried has been great and the service is good too. It's usually packed on Sunday afternoon, so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"This is probably the best restaurant to eat Mexican food and mariscos I love it. I totally recommend the shrimp tacos y el molcajete"}
{"text":"Went with my husband to try this place out since it's new with second location. Boy was that a mistake. Husband asked for a agua chiles which if you Hispanic you know what I'm talking about. The shrimp tasted old and smelled funny. So we just left that to the side. We weren't going to say anything but as we were eating the tostadas there was a dead roach in the basket !!! It was disgusting. I told the waitress we didn't wAnt the rest of  the food and to please take the shrimp away and showed her the basket   With the dead roach. She told us it was too late to cancel the order and we would have to pay for everything regardless of there lack of cleanliness and food hygiene."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this hole in the wall Mexican seafood  restaurant it was absolutely amazing probably in my top 5 favorite Mexican restaurant I ever eaten at !! Staff was super friendly and welcoming"}
{"text":"Great authentic mexican sea food. Great customer service and restaurant environment. I would definitely recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Just finished eating the Mojarra Frita and it was delicious. The garlic sauce they serve with it is to die for. Haven't been here in a while because of a bad burrito meal about a year ago, but they have definitely stepped there game up. Droop we gotta try this place again."}
{"text":"I love this place the food is good and the service. But don't ask for marriachi band music. They coming in want to play a song  a charge 15$for song the manager don't said nothing becase they don't work for the restaurant but they let them in to play"}
{"text":"Fresh seafood and delicious sauces.  \"The best hueovos rancheros I have ever had\" was how a table mate put it. Another had so many langostinos on his plate he had to share.   The guacamole was the best as long as you can appreciate all those little green specks of jalapeno.  4 people $60"}
{"text":"I love this place I am a loyal customer to this place love the food and great customer service strongly recommend if you like seafood."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's like a Mexican hot and juicy. But better, cause it's Mexican food and it's the bomb! They have really good michaladas here. Everything was just how I like, the flavor, the environment, the service. I wish I spoke Spanish but they were very accommodating. I like that the waitress offered me another michalada. I appreciated the gesture, but I had to go to work. If not it would have been a different story. It's def a chill spot. The kind of spot you wanna be all day :))"}
{"text":"The place looks nice the food was decent. But i think they hired a bunch of freaken stoners in the place. The reason is because they forgot a few items in my order. If this was the first time then it would slide.... I guess. But this is the second time. Im surprised they dont forget that we are there."}
{"text":"I had the botana mixta and it looked really good. But when I actually tried it, the shrimp was decent and the octopus had a funky texture..to chewy and normally it's chewable but hard. Overall I think this is an overpriced place and this place has nothing on Mariscos Moreno in Gardena,CA!"}
{"text":"Food is really great, best mariscos in las vegas, prices are reasonable as well and workers are friendly"}
{"text":"This is real yummy authentic Mexican seafood. No other place in Vegas like it. Taste is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Rico pero un poco caro. Recomiendo el ceviche de pescado."}
{"text":"AMAZING! So i went to there new location first time the one on Maryland and was so unhappy with my experience i will never be back to that one ,but some friends really wanted to go here to the one on lake mead I decided to go for it and let me say that its nothing like the one on Maryland . Definitely will be back to this location great service greeted right away and didn't have to wait for a table. The food seriously haven't had something like that in i don't know how long the taste is awesome and portions are good make sure you go hungry  I really recommend the dish \"la mojarra loca\" it took a little longer to cook but isn't an extreme wait and its worth it ! Oh and they had live music but its a pretty big place so its not crazy loud were you have to scream to be heard .Thank you again and I will be back for some more yummy food !"}
{"text":"Crazy...We ended up at this restaurant after a little change of plans. since my favorite seafood restaurant was packed because it was Mother's Day, we decided to try a less popular place just to find it also packed.....because it was Mother's Day. As soon as I saw a table being cleaned we passed the wait to be seated sign and sat  ourselves, we needed no menus, most Mexican seafood restaurants serve the usual  entrees so all we had to do is order from the menus embedded in our minds and if they ever say \"we don't have that\", then that would be a sign of not being authentic. We started with raw oysters and a bucket of modelos, we also ordered ceviche for appetizers. For entree  we ordered camarones a la diabla. (very spicy shrimp) camarones al mojo de ajo (garlic shrimp) and also camarones empanizados (fried breaded shrimp). Everything we ordered was very good and very authentic.  It was Mother's Day so there were two bands playing very loud music, Banda and mariachi adding to the authenticity of a real Mexican Restaurant were all your senses are fed. Service was good, food was good, ambiance was good ....life was good at la mojarra loca."}
{"text":"Well well let me start off by saying the food was great and I couldn't wait to go to this place because I had heard it was great and thats why im giving you two stars I might go back and give you a second opportunity at a different location just because the food really was enjoyment. There was 6 of us here we shared 3 different molcajete two were a mix of seafood mostly shellfish crab, oysters, shrimp,and lobster the other one one was shrimp chicken and steak they all had salsa and cactus also served with rice beans and your choice of tortilla. Like I said food great I also had a octopus cocktail it was great. My experience was ehh less then ok ill give the employees a taf bit of slack it was very busy but you absolutely as a server always advise your guest of an automatic gratuity even if you want to be shady and tell your guest sorry you didn't hear me I told you. ARE SERVER FAILED TO MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT GRATUITY! After doing the math when I left I thought there was a mistake I hurried back well unfortunately for me there wasn't a mistake I was told theres a gratuity added automatically to party's six or more we should know because its that way at every restraunt I promise this is what the gentlemen that works there told me when I asked can you show me where it says that in the menu I was told it didn't say it in the NEW MENUS! So people who read this be advised thete is a AUTOMATIC GRATUITY!! For party's six or more no you wont know like me because its not reflected on your hand written receipt and if your like me you will tip based of this amount so be advised. The server did give us are MONEY back for the gratuity that was 35 and we let her keep are 35$ tip so good luck hope your experience is different then mine minus the food part"}
{"text":"IF I COULD GIVE NO STARS I WOULD!! Food took a while to arrive, many people were unseated. They're unorganized. I waited an hour to get water and my check.. my mojarra had a nasty sauce on it that smelled like armpit. And they need to fix their restrooms."}
{"text":"A-ok hole in the wall authentic Mexican seafood place in a not-so-great part of town.   Coworkers and I tried this place out for lunch. One of them was raving about how great it was. And I am always one to try new things especially seafood.   Restaurant itself is spacious and clean. Inside you can buy fresh seafood. We sat down and waitress came to our table. I don't like how she didn't address us in English. Only one of us knew Spanish :-/  They serve chips and salsa on the house which was nice. It was very tasty with the right amount of spice. I ordered a langostino dish - don't remember the exact name. Refer to the pic below. It was served with rice, beans, salad and tortilla. The dish overall was ok. Edible but there was something off about the taste. Maybe I was scared to break out which was what happened to my other coworker the last time he came so I had some trepidation about my meal. (He had shrimp in a prior visit. He avoided it this time around)  And the tortillas tasted weird. I don't know if it was homemade or cooked in lard but I only had one and it was enough to keep me from wanting more.   I don't see myself coming back. The price overall was decent (it was paid for LOL, but I wouldn't come back and pay on my own).  I'm not sure if I'd really recommend this restaurant due to its location and overall average experience."}
{"text":"If I could I would give NEGATIVE 10 stars! We got seated in front of the guys doing the live music. We waited 20 minutes and not one person came by to take our drink order much less our food order. When I went to the cashier he was very rude and condescending. I told him politely that I have been waiting for 5 mins or more for my drink order and if he could let someone know. He asked me in a rude way \"5 mins?\" I then replied back \"Yes 5 mins or more\" (side note we waited 20 mins I didn't realize it had been that long until we left and I checked the time from messages I sent when I first got seated.) and he said okay go have a seat someone will help you when they can. I got the impression that he didn't care so I asked again if he could get someone to at least take my drink order to which he replied back \"I already said have a seat and wait longer\". I went back to tell my husband we were better off leaving and he was then telling the host about me and to check if we even had an order to which he called me that \"American\" senora (as we were walking away) he wanted to know if we owed any money and then pointed at me.  The host came back and I tried to tell her that I had been waiting for over 5 mins (we waited 20 mins from 5:52pm when we got in to 6:18). The host told me to hold on and walked away. The cashier guy then proceeded to tell me he already told me to wait and if I needed anything else. If not then have a good day. I am Mexican, It is people like this that gives us a bad name. Will never ever eat here again. Puta madre"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure if I was in the mood for some steak or sea food. We were driving by and decided to stop here.   -Very Clean, large ambient, perfect for large group party's or kick backs. They have a section that looks like it's designed just for parties.   -The waiters are very friendly and helpful, it was our first time and our questions in regards to items on the menu were answered politely and well detailed.   - They have groups of musicians who go around the tables asking if you want them to sing a song, it's pretty cool, but it can get pretty loud.   -The food itself is great and it's exactly how it looks on the menu, we ordered a \"Molcajate\" which is a pot with steak, chicken, shrimp, some \"nopales\" half of an avocado, tomato slices and onion peices, all smothered in salsa. It's amazing and feeds two people for only $21!"}
{"text":"The food is okay.. I like the environment here reminds me of Mexico, the waitresses are fast... we never got offer refills on our drinks tho but we didn't wait a long time to get our food either"}
{"text":"The ceviche was good till the place caught on fire and they kicked us out... Hope everyone was okay afterwards"}
{"text":"Los cocteles de camaron , excelentes! Pero para los platillos de combinacion , el cocinero de lamb y washington.. Super salado! Regreso por mariscos solamente!"}
{"text":"This place is great, my wife and I went to try it in our visit to Las Vegas and will go back every time we visit Vegas. My wife had the mojarra loca plate, not only did it look delicious it actually was. Servings were plentiful and flavor was awsome. Great food and service at a fair price. It is authentic!!!!!"}
{"text":"came in for a simple shrimp cocktail and a ceviche,the cocktail was pricey for the size and the amount of seafood in it ,also not much flavor to it,same thing with the ceviche casuelita at 15 dollars I really spected beter ,no seasoning or flavor on the ceviche whatsoever ,i could do much better without even trying.total waste of money and time probably would not come back"}
{"text":"In Las Vegas this is the Seafood Maximus.  If you are a seafood lover you'll fall in love twice, wait is that even possible? And if you are not a seafood lover I have to warn you the content is dangerously in love. My favorite plate is the Molcajete. No other place in The Valley has the tastiest, most chingon (coolest) in town. They have five different types of Molcajetes depending on your preference. The Molcajete Apache, which has pork ribs, the Azteca which has steak, chicken and chorizo. The Molcajete ranchero which contains steak and chicken. And the killer Molcajete Volcán cuidado!  It has crab, shrimp, octopus and Prawns. You can also order Tacos or Botanas. Botanas are their specialty, they are plates with different kinds of shrimp combinations. To mention are few are shrimps consentidos, shrimps al vapor or camarones locos. Don't forget the famous cócteles de camaron (shrimp cocktails) oysters, and prawns. The envious seven sea soup, and save the best for last. The Aguachiles. Only the aguachiles served here meet my expectations. The hard part is choosing which of the five you will eat, the loco is my preferred. Visit the seafood Maximus and you'll realize the value of this place, you won't find a replacement. Trust me on this one."}
{"text":"Totally nasty and grease, not sure why people like these place. Breakfast last Sunday suck and expensive. Mc Donald's would it been 100% better place to eat."}
{"text":"authentic Mexican Mariscos! every time i try something new its even better then the last time i went! friendly and attentive service!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for mariscos, I come here every other weekend, for special occasion or just to have a good beer, good prices GREAT food and all around good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious!! First time going there but everything was awesome!!  The waitress was not as fast kind of slow but it was ok.  Nice looking place nice and clean ! Definitely coming back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to come eat sea food if you're from out of town, this place was recommended and it was for sure one of  the best places I've tasted in a great while. Will definitely come back for sure. Party of 10 and everyone sure loved it."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place out as I've heard great things from friends and coworkers.... but if I could have the option to opt out of this experience, I would! The food wasn't terrible but it wasn't anything special. Food was a little bland and the oysters tasted really grimy.  The reason I am giving them a star is solely based on our customer service. My friends and I arrived around 9:50pm and we were told that they were closing at 10pm. We said we would order fast and eat, so I did not see the problem. We were going to pay for our food and everything. After waiting for our food, we started eating and we could all feel the waiters and waitresses staring at us to hurry the f*#% up so instantly I knew this wasn't going to be a good experience. After we finished, half of us left a tip and we were hoping they would add the tip to our tabs. But they did not. After one of the waitresses talked to the owner or manager, he started charging us a 20% tip on our foods after one of our friends diminished paying which I found unpleasant about. Not that we had to pay the extra 20%, we were fine with that to begin with but the way she said it and how the others were staying at us it was a safe bet I would never step foot in that place again. After that, the owner or manager tells the waitress to return the tip we left on the table and she became furious at that point. But who's fault was it really?  Then I guess they forgot to add certain items to the list so I had to remind them and to charge me it to my card. Seriously it was super unprofessional how the whole situation was handled and the employees were not the least friendly. NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN! NUNCA VOLVEMOS OTRA VES!"}
{"text":"Everytime my family and I come to Vegas we always make sure to stop here before leaving. Is being a very Hispanic family this is the perfect place to go, mariachi comes & play, the waitresses are all bilingual and amazing customer service, the portion sizes are huge! Although a little on the pricey side, it's so worth your money everytime!"}
{"text":"Blown away from this hidden gem. Food was so authentic and the service was impeccable. They must have at least 100 things on the menu and there's tons of photos in the menu to help you decide what to order. Everything we tried was out of this world. I forget the name of the appetizer we had but it had steak, shrimp and chicken and came in a delicious flavorful tomato based sauce and homemade tortillas. I had pollo ala plancha for dinner and it was amazing but at that point I www completely stuffedz"}
{"text":"Where do I begin ... we decided to go eat seafood since it was sacred Friday for us . First we went to mojara loca on Maryland the wait was long and we had all just got off work so we were hungry, so we decided to go to a different location. Let me tell you biggest mistake of our life, The wait at the other place would've been worth it. We ordered botanas and the shrimp were showered in oregano , my husbands plate was camarones costa azul , WOW! Let me tell you the the bacon wrapped around it was so crispy that when you took the bite it felt like you were biting rocks . I asked the lady for a plate that wasn't spicy, my little one is breastfeeding and has intolerance for it . She told mi camarones culichi wasn't spicy at all, when I received my plate all I could smell was the spice in it , I tried it and lord knows after a year of no spice that plate was spicy for me. I asked to get another plate and by the time I came to me the place was closed and the rest of my family was done eating !! I was so pissed off i didn't touch my food , I asked for a plate to go and still paid . We ended up going to a taco stand ! Moral of the story if the place is packed wait it will be worth your time"}
{"text":"Great environment with live music for sea food lovers. They have a minimal \"other than sea food\" food menu. Very tasty wet burritos :)"}
{"text":"This place was super yummy! My boyfriend got a recommendation for this place from a friend of ours. We had several types of ceviche that were really good. We also ordered a shrimp cocktail which was fantastic. I also had a fish taco. We also took a couple orders to go for the next day. I recommend this place. I only wish it was closer to our house. Our waitress was very nice. It was a lot of food and cost us about $70. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"A lot of their food there is basic but good. The one thing I do absolutely love from there is their little lobsters flavored in line and a special spicy sauce."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the best Mexican seafood that I have ate. I recommend this place for sure! Their micheladas and \"Camarones Al Ajillo\" and \"Lasgostinos\" are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite Mexican seafood places in town.  Every time I go I order the same thing because I cannot get enough, aguachiles & a spicy shrimp taco, they clean their shrimp well unlike other places. The molcajetes & tortitas de camaron are bomb too. The horchata here is really good (I'm picky about my horchatas) It's a good size place & the service is good. The prices for their portions are fair. I frequent a lot & haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"I get the campechana every time I eat here. The pulpo (octopus) is always super tender and flavorful. I have sampled a few of their other dishes (very good...a seafood lover's dream) but I keep coming back to my usual seafood cocktail. HUGE portions!!  We also enjoy the mariachi band that arrives around 5/6 o clock. Great hole-in-the-wall joint. This place is legit and we will keep coming back. :)"}
{"text":"Best Mexican seafood in Vegas. Love this place been here over 10 times. Would not change a thing."}
{"text":"Good grubbin when out on the east side. Specializes in Mexican seafood, dank complimentary chips and salsa and fresh limes. Most of the menu is in spanish, i learn as i go."}
{"text":"The food is great just the waiter suck no joke and I hate that they sell you every drink in other words no fountain drinks they sell you every pop but over all it's good little pricey"}
{"text":"The reason why I only gave this restaurant 3 stars is due to the fact that it is always a hit and miss. The food is always different depending on the chef and their service here lacks greatly. It is very hard to find great Mexican sea food places here in Vegas, so that being said as for now this is the best I've had."}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back for this lil gem in Oct!!! First time ever trying Oysters and OMG feel in love. They have amazing seafood with a twist."}
{"text":"Delicious mariscos! Live music! Reasonable prices! Great service! Endless chips & salsa! My fave mariscos spot in Vegas"}
{"text":"When craving any type of mexican seafood, this is the place to go. Their 'botana negra' is delicious!! Also, their preparadas are bomb!"}
{"text":"This Is a nice place to eat if your in the area we stopped in on a sunday and liked the shrimp its good mexican food :)"}
{"text":"Really good food!!! I love their molcajete!!! the prices are decent. The atmosphere is very Mexico like. The only reason I would take a star out is for the price of their Mariachi. They charged me $15 per song which I thought was pretty pricey in least than 10 minutes I ended up paying $45 dollars which I did not have budget."}
{"text":"Worst customer service! I asked three separate times for condiments and didn't get them.... Then when a bigger party arrived and it was like we weren't even there. No tip for dam sure...."}
{"text":"Got the shrimp cocktail, and grilled shrimp. What ever spices they used on the grilled shrimp kicked it up a notch. I wished they posted their hours and menu online."}
{"text":"We went to this place because we love the La Mojarra Loca Grill. We tried to order drinks but they only had beer. I asked for a iced tea with lemon instead and they didn't have it so we left."}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant last weekend for my father-in-law's birthday and spent over $200. From the moment we sat down, the service was terrible. Perhaps that is because for large parties, this establishment automatically adds a tip onto your bill. We were there for almost 2 hours, yet our waiters and waitresses never came by our table to check on us, when we would ask for a drink refill, they wouldn't bring it, they messed up our order and overall, they seemed more attentive to the smaller tables. I couldn't believe that a restaurant has the audacity to charge a large tip onto an already large bill without providing any hospitality or service that would warrant such a charge. I would never come here again. The food was good, but when you and your party blatantly get ignored, at least for me, that discounts my whole experience.  And for everybody going here with a large party (good luck with the service) - the automatic gratuity added onto your bill is NOT mandatory for you pay. Effective Jan. 1, 2014 the IRS held that these automatic charges ARE disputable. This automatic gratuity does not fit its definition of a \"tip\"; therefore, feel free to tell your waitress to take it off."}
{"text":"Food is good, portions are worth the money, BUT service sucks. Once our food is served, I never see the waitress again until we get our check, and only because we have to ask random workers who pass by that we need it. This happens every time we go eat there, for drink refills, more tortillas, or the check.  Only reason why we keep returning is for the food, since it still is way better to me than Islitas or Lindo Michoacan. Love their horchata, aguachiles, empanadas de camaron, and the molcajete!"}
{"text":"BEST SEAFOOD IN VEGAS!!! No joke trust me when I tell you they are delicious! I've been to other \"4-5\" star yelp places, this place surpasses them. The service and food is beyond fresh and finger licking GOOD!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place, nice decoration and the service was very good they were checking up on our table if everything was ok. Food was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Great place!! I was visiting from California and had been to one of their other locations on my last visit. I ordered the 'Langustinos al Rey'.... delicious!!  A red chile sauce, spicy and tangy. The chips were perfect and they serve salsa & a bean dip to die for. The waiters were very courteous and kept my table clean and my water filled.  The waitress, Janet, was friendly & very helpful .  I love that they are family friendly and have great food !"}
{"text":"I honestly liked everything as far as food  ! I went on a Monday afternoon so it wasn't as busy . Michelada was bombdotcom , shrimp coctel was amazing ...maybe a few more choices for kids under 3 would had been nice."}
{"text":"Great Mexican seafood! Good micheladas! Tons of choices so it's hard to decide. Prices look expensive but you really get a lot for your buck! We ordered too much! Seafood was all fresh but a little over seasoned (salty) . The volcan bowls look good!  But They use styrofoam plates:( bad for the environment. Mariachi bands, kids with candy, men selling pirated movies, and bands will try hustling to earn some cash. But it just adds to the ambiance :)  noticed a 2nd location in North LV. Worth trying and coming back!"}
{"text":"We were seated quickly and our orders were taken shortly after. They bring out chips and salsa and beans to keep you entertained. They sat us at a table and we asked to be moved to a booth since the people behind us had their chairs out all the way, she said she would ask and return... instead she never returned and they sat ONE man at the booth the 4 of us wanted. Oh well..  15 mins passed... then 30... and 45, no food! The server kept telling us the food was coming out, and it never came out! After an hour and 15 mins we just got up and left. Seriously such a waste of time!!! We didn't even order anything crazy! Burritos and pasta! WTF!?  Yeah, no thanks!"}
{"text":"To celebrate our mothers birthday, we decided to take her somewhere special on 5/26/14. She loves seafood and we all know its not cheap. I started my search on yelp for a good place with good reviews. This place showed to be great in both pictures and reviews. Prices were high but I thought due to such praise on Yelp, that it would be worth it.   We are a family from Mazatlan Sinaloa so we expected good food. As soon as we entered, there was no greeting and no seating. We brought a cake of our own so that was nice of them to store it in their fridge. Let me just say everything after that was pretty disappointing (service that is).   It's Memorial Day and we expected ALOT of people eating out so we were patient but it took FOREVER to get our our order placed. I felt bad for BOTH waitresses. Yes only 2 girls who where running around like headless chickens. Sorry but 2 people to wait on a full restaurant was not enough.   The food was very tasty but very pricy as well. I was shocked when I heard that one can of soda was $2.50! In our party there was 6 adults and 5 children. Our bill came out to be over $200 with tip included. Now I heard directly from another restaurant (olive garden) that it was no longer legal to include a tip on a bill of 6+ people. Is this true and if so why did they Include it? I was ok with food taste but not with the service. I don't believe they should tip themselves!  I think next time I feel like eating seafood, I will deffinately try out a different place and don't plan to go back to La Mojarra Loca. I tried it. Didnt like the service. Moving on..."}
{"text":"Super bad place .. The survive is horrible. I will never recommend this place to any of my friends or family. First time and the last time ."}
{"text":"I traveled clear across town to to try this place. I didn't feel like paying high prices for seafood so my friend recommended this restaurant.  The serving sizes were big and the atmosphere was festive! They have a live band playing and they go around taking requests.  I don't know why I didn't order an all seafood plate because that is why I came . I ended up ordering a bowl that came with Carne asada, chicken, and shrimp. They served it with tortillas. I did like it but since they have  extensive seafood choices I should have went that route.   The service is fast but you need to know a bit of Spanish to order so I helped my husband order his Carne Asada plate. I would definitely go back when I'm in the area !"}
{"text":"Love this place! Shrimp cocktail so good. My hubby loves the camarones bucaneros. Great service and owners are super nice!"}
{"text":"Ok for being a hole in the wall the place is good. All the waitresses are attentive and good looking. The salsa is on point. Im a hige salsa fan and I have to say some of the best I got was here.  I had the shrimp cocktail because thats what I was craving. It was plentiful on shrimp but it lacked some Pico.  The place it self has a small fish market inside and a couple large tvs. If there is a happy hour I would be here more often. All and all im definitely coming back and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"First time here and I fell in love. my husband ordered a seafood cocktail, and he loved it. I'm not into cold seafood so I ordered the camarones zarandeados, BEST shrimp I've ever had. So tasty. The only bad part was the shell on them, but I know it adds to the flavor, so that's not a real complaint.  On the menu it looks like you can only order them as an appetizer, but just ask and they'll create a dinner plate for you, totally worth the money. My friend ordered the camarones consentidos, they were AMAZING! not as much as the zarandeados, but still enough to write home about. they were in a tasty salsa, that's hot, but not too hot. just perfect.  everything here looks great. the ceviche looks amazing, but I will never pass up the opportunity to have a hot shrimp plate.  do yourself a favor and don't miss out on this little gem. go there now if you can."}
{"text":"Came in with my bf & his parents at around 4 pm on a Monday afternoon. We were greeted when we came in & were seated right away. It wasn't crazy packed but it was pretty busy. Upon entering, there is a group of musicians going around the tables playing music. They ask you if you would like to request any songs. According to my bf's parents, it's apparently $10 for one song... that's pretty steep lol. Nonetheless, they were pretty good!   So if you don't speak Spanish & aren't with anyone who does, ordering will probably be difficult for you. The whole menu is in Spanish (which is probably a good indicator that this place is authentic?) & there are pictures but not every single item has one. My bf helped me out with the menu & the ordering. We all got different dishes & I personally ordered the shrimp tacos. They give you a complimentary basket of chips & a side of salsa & beans while you wait for your order. The 'rents got an appetizer & I think it was called langostinas? Or langostins? Idk lol but HOLY SEAFOOD IT WAS AMAZING! The sauce, the meat, how it was prepared... srsly obsessed & I will keep coming back for that dish. The shrimp tacos were pretty good; my only gripe about the dish is that each Taco only came with 2 small/medium sized shrimp... for $14 I deserved more lol.   The service was good! They were very attentive & always came & checked up on us. The lady servers were also very pretty *heart eye emoji*. I wish this place was closer to home & not almost an hour away lol; otherwise, id be here allllll the time."}
{"text":"Legit! Took my family and friends for a birthday and we ate like kings! Portions out of control, great seafood options and fantastic flavors. Keep in mind you might have to wait a bit for your food, but your patience will be rewarded. Seriously great staff and a perfect place to go Loca!"}
{"text":"We've finally found a Mexican restaurant that doesn't taste TexMex. That's truer to Mexican flavors. If you love seafood this is the place!  Langostinos al Rey are the best!! The flavor of the juice in that dish are amazing (if you've had al mojo de ajo it's similar.)  Then it's El Molcajete Azteca! It has all grilled Chorizo, chicken, ranchera y costillas de Res, nopal, queso with a not too spicy salsa but enough to get that fix. They bring it HOT and sizzling! It's about $20 for 1 person and about $30 for 2 people but honestly the one person molcajete has enough meat for 3 or 2 people depends on your hunger. We just order extra tortillas.   The employees here are pretty nice and also very stressed on weekends. I think the food is worth the wait. If there is any mistakes on your order they will fix it right away, no need to be rude. You could knock it down a few stars for the wait on a busy day but the food makes up for it. If you like your food fast like McDonald's don't come here. Food is 100% here.   Good to bring someone on a date as well.  Forgot a gift? People come around selling roses and sometimes there's live music you can request a special song for $$. All Romantic stuff with little effort just more $$$."}
{"text":"The restaurant is delicious. My favorite thing to order is the Molcajete Trio with corn tortillas. The 1 person order is enough to feed 2, maybe 3, people and I eat ALOT so I always get the 2 person order so I can take some home. The price is definitely worth it though. All the other dishes are great as well. They have a live music playing at times and you can request certain songs. The weekends are very busy but worth the wait. The only downfall is the parking is limited especially on a busy day."}
{"text":"I had the mixed appetizer and molcajete mix. It was good i recommend this place. Idk why someone said it was tasteless well fuck you bitch."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite Mexican seafood restaurants in town. I love shrimp ceviche and theirs comes closest to my mom's. The tostada has a generous amount of delicious ceviche. One is enough to fill me up and is relatively inexpensive.  I tried their chilaquiles and they were decent. Very spicy, but they weren't too flavorful. I wasn't too impressed with their rice and beans either. They weren't bad, but like the chilaquiles, they lacked flavor. I did enjoy their fish tacos though. I guess you can play it safe by ordering their seafood.  I find it difficult to stray from my usual ceviche tostada, but I look forward to going back and trying some of their other menu items. Definitely a place I'll visit when I crave ceviche!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant it has some of the best food in town! I tried the Molcajete and it was Yummi Yummi I also recommend to try the seafood here that's their speciality ! The place is clean and nice also the service was good ;)"}
{"text":"Such an amazing place.  I was driving the area and noticed the parking lot was full in this business center. Upon arriving I saw no one was at the other places all were here. Lol  As I walked in the smell, music (mariachi band was playing) and decor was more than I could have envisioned.  So authentic is all aspects.  I was seated promptly by the hostess, the complimentary chips and salsa arrived in a minute and the waitress was just as quick.  I ordered a Modelo and the Camarones al mojo as ajo (garlic shrimp) from a previous review.   The food was amazingly delightful and the portion size was huge. The garlic sauce was on point and the overall experience was spectacular.    Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to get a michelada or any mariscos. Love the service!! Micheladas are the best ones I've tried."}
{"text":"I went with my family of 6 & we ordered 3 of the trio molcajete bowls. They were huge!! We got to two person ones so we paired up and two people shared a bowl. It was more than enough!! It was amazing! Best mariscos I've been to. I also ordered culichi (which wasn't on the menu but the chef still made it) and its a creamy green sauce served with shrimp and fries to dip! I highly recommend both dishes! The server was awesome and very helpful and cooperative especially since no one in my family spoke Spanish. Very clean place, live mariachi band, and such great food."}
{"text":"Super good micheladas. I recommend Los camarones caporales. I had them yesterday and they were delicious !"}
{"text":"I've never been to a place like this!!! I think this is the best Mexican restaurant. It's even better than my experience at Javier's at the Aria. The only thing is I had to go with my Spanish speaking friends and its location was a far reach for me.  Initially I took a pic of the food but I felt like it didn't do enough justice for the presentation of the steaming hot food. So it was worthy of a video! I can't tell you want we order but I can show you. I can't tell you that our meal for three was enough for ten. It was all under 60 bucks?!?! It felt like a mini Mexico in there. The server was full of smiles and very courteous! It's not fine dining seafood but honestly what good is the atmosphere and surroundings if the food sucks.   It was so good I just want to tell everyone about it. Anyone even considering this place is in for a treat. You could be like me and be a returning customer for sure."}
{"text":"Food poisoning alert!! Came here to eat some great seafood since im coming from orange county i had been here before once it was good last time , but this time horrible service and i say horrible because we sat next to a couple who got there before us and he kept asking what time his food was coming out couple waitress ignore them so they took off , i was shocked i felt horrible because as we were getting our food they left ... Anyways i had camarones bucaneros they had a funky taste but i didn't think much of it i thought thats how it was supposed to taste and my hubby had some langostinos ... While we were eating ive seen a group of people come in to eat and they waited soo long for their food until this lady asked them for their food and they brought it out immediately it was menudo.. I guess the lady found something in her menudo because she returned it and they brought her a new one.. So it was time for us to ask for our bill but it literally took us 30 minutes to get a waitress attention we left and after we left we went to a casino to play and omg in the middle of my good game i had major stomach ache so i had to run to the restroom and yea it was the shrimp i had here at Mojarra loca after that we left the casino and my husband started feeling sick so our rest of our day was sicknesd due to the food .. Never again ever i saw two cases of bad customer service plus our food poisoning that ruining our mini vacay .. Never coming back to this restaurant i will stick to las islitas"}
{"text":"Mi filete a la plancha, excelente! Los filetes empanisados de mis hijos y de mi suegra, fabulosos! Mis niños se lo acabaron todo, y eso no sucede muy seguido!  Los que nos atendieron fueron muy atentos y amables tambien!"}
{"text":"Great seafood!  They offer different types of Ceviche. Great Mechelada's. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love eating here it's filled with an authentic atmosphere(the music,the furniture, the food!) what I really enjoyed was that it was very good food for a GOOD PRICE! I believe I had \"camarones a la diabla\" and the dish was about $16 with a drink? My meal was about $20 which I think is a great affordable price for seafood! Don't miss out I extremely recommend, not to mention they also offer unlimited hand maid corn tortillas that make me want to come back every weekend!(:"}
{"text":"Love this place it looks small from the outside but its a real good size inside. The food has always been amazing the last time i went i ordered the crayfish marinated in butter limon and chile i forgot whats it called... anyway it was amazing! Service was amazing too. My daughter doesn't like chicken nuggets but she loved the dinosaur chicken nuggets and French fries. The price is a little more the the other marisco places around but it wont stop me from going again."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!... Came to Celebrate my wifes bday... The food was great and the service as well. The amount of food was just perfect. Reasonable prices and great quality...  Very Satisfied and will definetly come back. Definetly try the micheladas ..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for mariscos (Mexican seafood), everything is fresh and delicious. My favorite dishes are the camarones de ajo, which is shrimp with a garlic sauce, amazing! They also have really fresh shrimp cocktails that you can get with shrimp or mixed with octopus.  P.S. Just a heads up, the menu is mostly in Spanish, but they usually have someone there to translate for you."}
{"text":"First time coming here, La Mojarra Loca did not disappoint. The location is very far from my house, so my expectations were somewhat high.  When we first walked in we were greeted with a smile, and walked over to our table without having to wait. Throughout our whole meal the waitress always had a smile on her face and checked up on us regularly. I would suggest maybe bringing someone who can read in Spanish because the majority of the menu is in Spanish. I had to order for my gf because of this. Now let's get to the food!  They gave us complementary chips with salsa and beans. The chips were fresh and crispy, the kind of chips that get you full because you can't stop eating them. For our appetizer we ordered Langostinas Al Rey, the shellfish was perfectly cooked and bathed in a delicious spicy broth. The broth was so good I actually used it as a dip for my entree. If you like boiling crab, you will absolutely love the dish.  I ordered the steak fajitas (fajitas de res), it wasn't anything new, but the meat and veggies were delicious nonetheless. The portions of the meals were extremely big, nothing wrong about that. I ended up having to take mine home.  This place has a great authentic feel along with delicious food to prove it!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location before but this will most likely be my last visit. My family and I showed up right when they opened and they were having an employee meeting in the middle of the restaurant. They were VERY loud and arguing the entire time. Our waitress was walking back and forth from our table to theirs. We ran out of tortillas and chips and we needed limes and some  drink refills but she was preoccupied with the arguments going on at their table. We had to yell \"excuse me\" to get her attention. We waited for the check for about 15 minutes because like I said before, they were all too bussy with their arguments. She was very friendly but she was very very distracted. They should have their meetings while closed."}
{"text":"This is our second time here for breakfast this week.  This little chain has grown to 3 locations.  They have a great chilaquilles and eggs special for $6.99 comes with beans and potatoes.   It was pretty good and large portion although I did add some extra crunched up chips to mine as I like a little crunch in mine like I have had in some parts of mexico.  Very clean place, a fish counter to pick out your own fish to have cooked.  Included some pics of our breakfast.  We now need to try it for dinner. Since this is a seafood restaurant the prices run from around $14 to $22.  They also have lots of platter for 2 and more people."}
{"text":"I've been to this place quite a lot with different members of my family the food is good don't get me wrong but the most recent time I went with my wife was horrible we sat down and instantly I get treated differently from when I walk in I'm not sure what their issue is but it's been the past few times that they treat me differently has to be my ethnicity which i think is complete crap that they judge me as soon as I walk in when I've actually probably been to different parts of Mexico then some of the employees this time we sat down they served us chips and salsa as usual. They sat a few other guests down an took their drink within five minutes when we were there for longer then 15 minutes with out being asked for our drinks we got up and left I hope the management sees this and adjusts it somehow I've spent a lot of money in this place but won't be going back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fresh sea food one of the few local restaurants here in Vegas . AguaChiles con callo are too die for .  Grilled Shrimp is a fantastic appetizer to begin with it's the best I had . Reminded me the food from Mazatlan in Mexico ."}
{"text":"Definitely a family environment! I would come here if you are looking to for fresh Mexican seafood! They have big tables for big parties however on the weekends it does get busy and sometimes there is about a 15-20 min wait. The park lot also gets filled, you might need to park on the street. On The Weekends they also have a mariachi that charges you per song, however it does get very loud when others pay for a songs. It's hard to hear between your group without speaking very loud. They usually charge $5 per song. Price point is not bad for seafood and the portions you get are good it's good for sharing family."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Seafood restaurant in Las Vegas!!! The food is absolutely delicious, you will find unique flavors... A lot of variety,  so much on the menu, my faves are langostinos, recuerdame shrimp, pasta with shrimp and a special spicy kick!!, oh and did I mention homemade tortillas..!! Wow!!! Visiting this place is a must!"}
{"text":"I always like to try new places and this time it was a big mistake , the seafood doesn't even taste fresh and authentic mexican, I will say the best thing they have is the tacos , and to end the desapoinment the food takes for ever to get out is ridiculous. Not going back ever"}
