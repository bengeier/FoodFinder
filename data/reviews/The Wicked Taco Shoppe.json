{"text":"Decided to check out the new place after getting a flyer on my car. First, neither the front counter clerk nor the cook knew what the menu items were!! How can you have a meat on your menu and not know what it is??!! We ordered one basic chicken taco and a 3-pack of steak tacos since that seemed easy. 10 minutes later we saw food placed on the counter.  Not under a heat lamp. Another 10 minutes later...the counter person brought that food over to us. Our tacos were ICE cold. Yes...ice. I think the corn salsa was in ice and throwing it on top of the meat was just gross. We asked for our money back and the counter clerk was very apologetic. That was the only good thing about this place. Oh yeah...while we were there we heard them talking how they gave the wrong food for pick up to another, soon to be, unhappy customer. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Decent. They have vegan options including tofu and beans. They didn't have them marked as vegan but they were willing to look at the ingredients for everything to make sure it was and they even assured me that they cook it separate from animal-derived ingredients. All-in-all a great experience employee-wise.  The food was good, not great, but good. The prices, not too bad, and they will deliver to my house, which is always a plus. I will have to try their tacos soon."}
{"text":"We recently moved here and were excited to see this place open up in our neighborhood. We are originally from the SF Bay Area and have spent the past 10 years living in a largely Mexican neighborhood of Chicago. We must say that The Wicked Taco Shoppe definitely has the closest thing to the San Francisco style burritos we have ever had in the Midwest! The size and shape of the burrito and the ratio of rice, beans, and meat was perfect!   We couldn't give 5 stars because it seems like they are still working out some kinks; the burritos were wrapped a bit loose, they ran out of carne asada, forgot to put salsa and crema on my husband's burrito and the carnitas were a bit dry. But I had the chicken and it was really moist and flavorful. I also had their cilantro lime pesto and it was great.   We like what this place is trying to do and we look forward to frequenting it and seeing how they settle in to their groove."}
{"text":"I had to cancel an event with The Wicked Chafer at the beginning of August, 2015 for an event set on November 13th, 2015. Per the company's refund policy I followed their rules in a timely and respectable manner - wrote and mailed a formal letter officially cancelling the event (the letter was approved by the company so that I would receive a full refund). I also gave the company AMPLE time - falling within their 90 day cancellation policy. WHAT IS THE ISSUE HERE? I have been ignored and lied to repeatedly.   I have several email and text correspondence from both Kevin Spring and Derek DeVoe apologizing and promising me my refund \"promptly.\" I have been more than patient with these people. I completely understand the frustrations of cancelling catering events, as I have worked in this industry for 10 years, however, my cancellation should not have inconvenienced anyone considering the amount of notice I gave. Where is my money? The moment my refund letter was approved that money became mine again so, as far as I am concerned, this company has stolen from me.  I paid $1,132.77 on March 9th, 2015, was approved for a refund in mid-August and told I would receive my money back within 14 days....it is now November 12th and my money is still nowhere to be found.   Email from Partner of the Company Monday, September 14th:  Hello Hannah,  Extremely sorry for the late response we have been working day and night to open our new concept The Wicked Taco Shoppe in Cleveland Heights Ohio.  We did receive your letter and we will be cutting you a check for the deposit you had given us, all I need is your mailing address so that I can send it to you promptly.  Thank you again for your time and I hope all is well.  Derek DeVoe Vice President of Operations   Wicked Brands of Ohio Inc The Wicked Chafer The Wicked Egg The Wicked Wrap The Wicked Taco Shoppe The Wicked Ramen and Pho  114 Barrington Square Suite 233 Aurora, OH  44202  Emails from CEO Thursday, October 15th and Friday, October 16th:  Hi Hannah  You have my apologies for our failure to communicate and resolve this some time ago. My cell is 619 646 5945 should you have any questions.  I will send your deposit out first thing in the morning and will send you a tracking code via my PA.  Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I will find out where we failed and rectify it immediately. In your case, I will make this right tomorrow in the morning.  Warmest,  Kevin Spring CEO / Corporate Chef  Wicked Brands of Ohio Inc The Wicked Chafer The Wicked Egg The Wicked Wrap The Wicked Taco Shoppe The Wicked Ramen and Pho  114 Barrington Town Square Suite 233 Aurora, OH 44202  Not a problem what so ever. I do apologize for the lack of communication and failing to return the deposit in expeditious manner. I will look into it and ensure that it never happens again  Should you have any questionswhat so ever, please call me at 619 646 5945. That is my personal cell  Refund has been issued and you should recieve it within 3 days. I am sorry to hear that you had to reschedule your wedding. But all great things sometimes are meant for later. When the stars align and it is meant to be, all the doors will fly open.  I am not concerned if you were within the refund policy or not, this company would not have kept ny of your money. Only when the food is purchased ( 2 days before) is when penalties apply. You are absolutely fine and I wish youtwo all the best and happiness that life has to offer. Congratulations on all the great things happening for you two.  Warmest and sincerest,  Kevin  *Update 11/24/15 - I was contacted by the BBB informing me that they spoke with Kevin, last week and he was planning on handling my refund but has yet to do so. Kolby, from Thumbtack, has been working to get my money returned to me, and contacted me yesterday informing me that Kevin said I did not fall within their policy for a refund, which I have multiple documented communications proving that I did.   This thriving company, that just expanded their business, has robbed me of $1,132.77 of MY hard-earned money. I am sorry I am no longer getting married. I am sorry for being patient and handling my cancellation exactly how your company asks. I am sorry for wanting my money returned to me like I have been told now for months. These people are CRUEL. I am being evicted from my apartment because I have been depending on this money to pay my bills, college debt and trying to get on my own feet as a newly single 28 year-old. Going through such a devastating process as a cancelled engagement has been hard enough, this company has made my life a living nightmare. I wish they actually cared about what $1,000 is to a person. Obviously they will take anything from anyone."}
{"text":"I was soooo excited to try this place, but i can only give them  3 stars....the food is decent but it was LUKE WARM at best.  We got a burrito, a couple of tacos, rice and beans, and sopapillas (flat churros). The burrito was gigantic 2-3lbs. The rice was mush.  The carne asada was good but the carnitas didn't have much flavor.  Finally, check your orders!! The kid at the counter was super nice but seem unorganized and did not know the menu-- They forgot the soda and rice & beans which come with a combo order.  Chipotle doesn't have to worry.  I will try this place again- they just opened."}
{"text":"This is a new Mexican street food restaurant. The food was great, prices reasonable. They were out of several toppings, but as a new restaurant I can understand how that might happen. We would definitely come back.   The tacos were a good size and not too large. All 3 meats that we tried, the carne asada, carne molido, and pollo oaxaca were all delicious and well spiced. The toppings were fresh and the red sauce was very good."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night and I wasn't impressed.  There was only one other guest while I was there and yet the food was slow in coming out.  I had a fish taco and a shrimp taco, neither of which lived up to expectations.  The fish was alright, the shrimp seemed to be precooked and then reheated rather then cooked fresh.  Both tacos were way over sauced and could have used some more vegetables to add some crunch.   The whole place feels kind of thrown together and not well thought out.  There are much better options the this."}
{"text":"The tacos here are amazing.  The staff there was super helpful and friendly.  I ordered one of each type of filling they had for tacos and they were all perfectly marinated/spiced and toppings were fresh.    They are traditional street-style tacos and are a little smaller than the overloaded tacos you find at other restaurants, so order appropriately.  Great place.  Make sure you give it a try."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this restaurant twice. First time after an hour they called and said they couldn't deliver due to kitchen issues. Tried again today. This time after an hour they call and say they don't have a driver. If they don't have the capability to deliver then they shouldn't offer it. I'm hoping it's because they're new and not at full staff, and not just them making excuses."}
{"text":"This is the kind of food that the neighborhood has been missing! Great service and huge portions. Very fresh tasting with enough meat/protein and topping options for both authentic and more out-there Mexican street foods. Definitely going back to try some more of the menu items. Already a game changer but if you can start doing tortas... :O"}
{"text":"So far, it seems they have one big important thing right at Wicked Taco: The Food! The tacos were excellent. I recommend authentic style, if you want to have real, simple tacos with a real shell. (though only single wrapped, I prefer it that way!). For those talking about the warmth of the food, its a small amount of meat and lots toppings. Tacos are usually served that way, and open-faced. If you want something hot get the burrito or ask about what is warm. I will say the interior of the place really needs some more love, but its not the decor that you come for: its the tacos!"}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito with green sauce and hot sauce added to each bite is the best food I have had in recent memory. It is also the size of a baby"}
