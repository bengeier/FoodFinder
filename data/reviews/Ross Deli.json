{"text":"Great beer store, impressive selection. Growlers and various taps for your pleasure. The staff is goofy and friendly. 

Make sure to ask about \"Baltika\""}
{"text":"stopped in today to look for a particular microbrew. great selection. really nice customer service. they didnt have what we were looking for, but told us another place we might find it. dont see that too often. good neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"Great spot for spirits and craft beer!!!! My 2 friends and I had a craft beer draft and it was great!!! The patio outdoor area is where we sat to enjoy our Friday afternoon. Coming from chicago, this is a great spot for craft beer and the staff was friendly and helpful!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! 

The staff could not be nicer or more helpful. I have had so many conversations with them about beer and it's always really enjoyable. They have a great selection of beer on tap to fill up growlers, which is awesome. You can also make your own six pack and the selection is pretty good for that! Lots of other beer and wine to choose from. 

I heard about this place from Melt, by the way. They mention on the menu that you can find the beers they have at this place, which is why I first went here. Now I live nearby and go here fairly regularly. It's awesome!"}
{"text":"So the owners have since canned the tall idiot who worked here. The place hired a few new faces, and I have to say that I eat my words previously posted. It's local, cheap, and the staff is way knowledgeable in regards to the products they sell. The current manager makes me feel like my own local \"cheers\" bar theme. They even will get beer or other products just for you if they don't currently have what you need. Try it out and tell me if I'm wrong."}
{"text":"Awesome and friendly place. They are so helpful and their knowledge of wine / beer is incredible. Great growler station and make your own 6 pack."}
{"text":"Finding Ross' Deli was a shock.  How did I live in Lakewood this long and NOT know I could buy my favorite beers by the growler?  Beyond that, a growler usually has a savings of 10-20% off the price of a 6-pack!

You do have to pay to rent the growler from them, I think it was a couple bucks.  However, once you've got one they'll exchange it for a clean one each time you return for a refill.  This is a great way to save on seasonal specialty brews that can get expensive.

They also have a wide variety of bottles and wine if memory serves.  (Which it rarely does, but who cares! GROWLERS!)"}
{"text":"Probably the best beer selection in Flakewood and thats saying something.  They have pretty much all the standbys and a few rarities but the rare stiff doesnt stay long.  A sign of the times, I guess.  Everyones an expert now.  Also,  another sign of the times is that the price of beer has gone through the roof.  Sucks.  This place is on the higher end of beer prices.  I miss the 6.99 for a sixer craft beer days..."}
{"text":"Yeesh, within the past few months, this place was recently renovated and not for the better. The indoor tasting spot is gone; replaced by just some open space and a door to their office. 

Their beer selection has also decreased remarkably. Their selection isn't bad but it's not noteworthy or distinct from other Lakewood beer stores like Rozi's, or Cap n' cork. They still have 5-6 coolers of singles - organized by style (nearly American micros, but nothing that uniquely distributed) and heavily focused on IPAs with some more expensive bottles $10+ from the Ohio breweries but their overall selection still had decreased from the past. 

Their selection was great but now it's a-okay. If I cared enough, I'd argue Chas that Rozi's or somewhere probably has a larger selection... 

The space for wine has increased but if their changes to beer are any indication; don't bother making a special trip here; you can find the same product at most other stores in the area."}
{"text":"I thought this place would have a larger variety of beers, but it doesn't seem to have anything more than usual. They have all of the standard beers in bottles and cans. I was looking for particularly special bottles for their bottle caps but wasn't able to find anything I hadn't already had before. It's a fine store, just nothing special about it. One thing that they really should invest in? Better lighting. The coolers are so poorly lit and the flickering of dying lights doesn't make it any easier to find what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Owner remembers and values every customer. He must take good care of his staff too, because they have a sense of ownership about place and they also treat customers well. Easy parking in back. The growler station and the customer service make this the best place to buy beer.  Huge selection of micros but also carries Miller High Life."}
