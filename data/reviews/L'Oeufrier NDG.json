{"text":"An adequate eggs Benny.   Pleasant service and surroundings. Unfortunately just same old.  Four or five resteraunts are within 3-4 blocks.  This space was Agora  for many years.   An above average Greek cockney place with big portions and reasonable prices. Peter who owned it moved on and since it's been another Greek, Indian and now brekkie place."}
{"text":"It opened in May 2016 and just celebrated its one year anniversary. Loveliest couple in the world run the place. Service is terrific, food is comforting and consistently good. I hope the neighbourhood embraces this very pretty and quite trendy spot. I go at least once a week and I'm always happy  :-)"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot,  quick service, huge portions, and friendly staff.  Just wished this chain was in Ontario, but we silk be back"}
{"text":"I've been to other L'Oeufrier locations but will make a point to steer clear of this one. The owners insist on service customers themselves when they reeeeeally should stick to managing. Their service skills are abysmal. The food wasn't as good as other locations, and when issues were brought up (such as neither of us ever getting out toasts) they got defensive and accused of us telling them we didn't want toast (a total figment of their imagination). They don't understand the flow of service, nor did anyone ever check on us once our food was dropped off. We witnessed similar issues with tables around us (tables being sat but having to go get their own menus, large group asked for the childrens meals asap when the kids meals only came after the adults). Overall the owners need to step back and hire proper wait staff."}
