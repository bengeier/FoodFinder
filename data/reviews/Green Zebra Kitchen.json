{"text":"The food is dairy and gluten free, very flavourful and fresh!  Good options for a la carte and delivery in evening is a plus for working people.  They are quick to respond to your questions and very personable.  I trust this company. \"Fresh\" is important to me as I have tried a few other food delivery services and the food definitely was not fresh.  But, I do find that some of the main meals need to be supplemented with rice or beans as the portions are small.  The best food delivery service I have found in Toronto."}
{"text":"We have tried 2 weeks of meals and are very pleased. The food has been fresh and delicious. Best tasting kale side  salad I have ever had."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan. My diet is semi-vegetarian and I like to consume lots of vegetables, nuts and beans. I ordered a week's worth of a la carte and was happily satisfied. Spaced dishes between lunch and dinner and still had plenty of leftovers. The Banh Mi Bowl with portobello mushrooms, tofu, broccoli & Miso dressing, the Pad Thai zoodles and kale salad with beets, carrots, sunflower seeds & sesame-ginger dressing were by far my favourite three out of seven. Advantages of ordering from Green Zebra are not having to cook, clean and meal prep, having fresh and tasty options, plus it's a healthier alternative compared with other more boring meal delivery services in the GTA. Useful for working professionals who don't have the time or energy to cook!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from Green Zebra Kitchen a few times for their meal delivery services. There aren't a lot of vegan or plant based options in town for meal delivery and was pretty excited to find this option online. You have to order by Sunday at 8pm and they deliver your meals all at once on a Tuesday at a time slot you select.   They offer a small plan (each main meal is 2 cups and side dish is 1 cup) or a large plan (double the amount), or you can pick and choose which meals and what quantity you would like to order. The meal plans are set, but if you order ala carte you can choose which combinations you want.   For the entree's everything I have tried has been really delicious. For the salads the only one I liked was the kale salad (they make it every week) so I decided to skip further ordering any set meal plans as I found the lentil and quinoa based salads a little too bland and dry to stomach. They do try and pair a salad and an entree and suggest what order you eat your meals on.   Some of my favourite dishes is their mac and cashew cheese with roasted cauliflower and the \"moussaka\" and anything with their tempeh in it. I would prefer if their pasta wasn't the gluten free type as it does get a bit too overcooked once you reheat it, but maybe they are trying to accommodate everyone. Although they don't say their meals are vegan or dairy free they are. They also will try and accommodate food allergies as well. I'm not sure if there is a reason they are marketing without mentioning the meals are plant based, gluten free or dairy free, but i'm pretty certain most people would enjoy their food regardless of diet."}
