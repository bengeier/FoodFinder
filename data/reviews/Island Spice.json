{"text":"The food was ok the customer service was terrible and the line takes 40 min to buy Chicken!!! It's not fine dine   I paid 43$ for oxtail and chicken, a little expensive ?    The customer service is garbage  The more you buy the more they yell at you and get mad  at you.'?!                    F-    Food not worth the 40 min line  up Even if you pay for food  they act  like you are asking it for free   Complete ignorant people  running the front"}
{"text":"This place is a definite 5 star and it's real authentic Jamaican food. Hard to find food that's seasoned and prepared this well anywhere. I always get the BBQ Jerk with the HUGE festival or rice and peas with oxtail gravy.  Keep up the great work!!!"}
{"text":"Best jerk chicken in the city bar none. Their daily special is a great deal, giving you two pieces of chicken, a generous portion of rice and gravy, and coleslaw. However, the parking lot is a bit of a mess and they are closed on Sundays. If you have a car that's is low to the ground, be wary of the plaza's driveway (my old '08 Acura TL managed to scrape on the entrance now and then)."}
{"text":"Their jerk chicken is the best I've tasted by far. Worth the travel just for the chicken"}
{"text":"Definitely a top, must try jerk chicken spot in the Scarborough area. The jerk chicken is constantly delicious, spicy and full of flavour. I typically get the jerk chicken special with rice and peas and oxtail gravy and I am always left with extra food, as their servings are quite generous. Service is always fast. And the quality and quantity of food you get in a special definitely exceeds the cost. Only notable downfall to this place is that they do run out of jerk chicken by the end of the day - so make sure you go hours before closing!"}
{"text":"This place has really great food! Just like any local Caribbean restaurant. It's tiny and they only make enough food for the day, so once that batch is done, you're out of luck. I usually get the jerk chicken which is amazing but today I tried the tilapia. Omg it was so tasty! I'm Caribbean so I know good fish when I taste it--seasoned well, perfect soft texture, and not overdone with a million different spices.   As for service, it's the kind of service you would expect to get at a non mainstream Caribbean restaurant, so I'll leave it at that. Lol.   I always get the lunch special which is just over $6. With that you get the choice between rice and peas or a big dumpling (aka fried bake) along with your meat. It's the perfect size portion for one person.   I look forward to my next meal"}
{"text":"Hands down the best curry goat I've ever had, and I've had lots of curry goat.  The seasoning and spices were perfect.  A little on the expensive side ($19.20 for large) but worth it.  Service is also a bit slow but I think they do it on purpose to give you a more authentic island vibe :)"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my go to spots when craving chicken of any sort. The prices are amazing, the people are kind and the food is nothing short of fantastic!   The most common meal people purchase when going here would be their daily specials which include one type of protein, varying from fried chicken, bbq chicken, jerk bbq chicken, jerk chicken and traditional style fish dishes with your choice of rice or dumpling. Dumpling is simply fried dough that has a hint of sweetness. With tax this meal comes up to about $9 & it it really filling. I would say you can share, but if you have not eaten you should probably each get your own.   My favourite chicken is the bbq jerk, it has the spiciness of the jerk chicken with the sweetness of the bbq sauce to make the perfect balance. The jerk chicken for me is too spicy, as I'm not a fan of spice. The bbq chicken can get very sweet after the first couple of bites, but still amazing if you're in the mood. And the fried chicken is good, but you might as well eat something that has sauce with it.   I have also tried one of their other meals, they serve traditional Caribbean dishes including king fish and ox tail. We tried the oxtail, which sadly you can only buy in large. It comes with rice or two dumplings. The flavour was amazing, however for the whopping price of $18.99, your money is better spent on other items on the menu.   Overall though, island spice never disappoints!"}
{"text":"The flavor of the jerk chicken and oxtail curry is sooo rich and deep, one of my favorites around. The price went up a for the daily special, which kinda sucks but I understand it, will keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"We live in the neighbourhood and often frequent Island Spice for our jerk cravings. Make sure you ask for coleslaw, as they don't automatically give it to you. Lunch specials are a good deal.   Parking lot can get busy, and it's a bit of a weird layout. Closed Sunday's.  They moved to a bigger locations a few doors down in the plaza, but the last couple of times I've been there they got rid of the chairs and tables... So be expected to do take out- or stand and eat?"}
