{"text":"This unassuming family-run restaurant is a terrific lunch spot and is well-worth the trip if you're looking for quality South Asian cuisine. There's plenty of Asian options if you're not interested in Malaysian food, but you really should try their Laksa, a traditional Malaysian dish which they execute extremely well. The beef rendang is  also quite good, especially when paired with coconut rice.  The restaurant itself is fairly bare-bones and somewhat stark, with old wooden tables, cheap chairs, and a dated color palette. The restaurant was fairly empty when I came for lunch - perhaps it was an off day - which makes the place seem more sombre. Importantly, the service is excellent - your teapot will never be empty and the owner (who took our order) is more than happy to explain in depth what particular dishes are all about.  Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Great food especially beef rendang laksa so good. Personally i like this more than seafood. Yummy"}
{"text":"As a local I appreciate this family a lot!  I have had four of their dishes (Beef ball Laksa, Mee Goreng, Seafood Laksa, and Nasi Goreng) all were fantastic. As a white male I can not comment on the authenticity but the flavours and food combinations are savoury and delicious. The laksa (lv 5) has me sweating but is still very enjoyable. The noodles and rice dishes have been crisp and flavourful. Very quick preparation time and low cost. Highly recommend it for people in Hidden Valley as well as any one looking for great Malaysian food."}
{"text":"Mamak Dang fusion Malaysian cuisine are taking over tropical delight. Who wanna try out some Malaysian foods you are welcome.  Oct 1 our business hours is tues to thurs 11am-3pm, 5pm-8pm and sat sun 12pm-8pm . Hope to see you guys"}
{"text":"As every other reviewer says, the standout on this menu is the great Laksa, a seafood and noodle soup with spicy coconut broth, tofu, egg, and few token cruciferous veg.  If you haven't had it, try it!  The rest of the menu is quite minimal, with some of that small set appearing to cater to unadventurous workers from the surrounding industrial park (e.g. spring rolls and sweet and sour chicken), just to pay the bills. Evidence of this is that the server was visibly excited when we ordered both the Laksa and the Nasi Lemak with Beef Rendang (one of only three off-the-beaten path options). The Nasi Lemak is a coconut rice infused with lemon grass, and topped with green onion and crispy anchovy bits.  This was a nice change from regular rice, with the anchovies definitely adding some punch without being really overpowering.  The beef rendang was also quite good, a mild red curry that paired nicely with the rice...though I give the edge to the rendang at Indonesian Kitchen in my Ultimate Pan-Restaurant Menu.   If this was a food truck, they would get away with just these few good ethnic menu items, but as a restaurant, it falls a bit short on selection, hence my 3 star rating. The prices seem to have gone up recently. I selfishly hope they're squirreling the extra cash away to bring us a full menu, in which case 4 or 5 stars will definitely be in order!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderfully fast and cheap lil take out place. Relative to the other Malay places in town, this is best price for portions and quality. But again it is only take out. There were a few counter seats if you just want to eat and go. I called and ordered Sea food laksa, curry chicken laksa and Stir fried flat white noodles. The whole thing was well packed and no leakage occurred. The soup is packed separate from the laksa contents, which is how its suppose to be done. They only needed 10 minutes to get the whole order done.   The laksa were heavy on grease, but that's Malay food, same as other places. It was great heaping portions, very savoury and not spicy at all. The chicken had bone and skin, which was fine for us. The flat noodles were flavourful, but nothing too special.   They only take debit and cash. No credit cards.   We will definitely try the place again and some of the other laksa/soup dishes."}
{"text":"Best Laksa in Calgary, the staff is friendly and cares about people enjoying thier food. They serve the Laksa in various levels of spiciness, level 1 is regular and 10 is just off the charts, the most I could handle was a 5, but to enjoy it, I would recommend a 3. FYI, Take out only."}
{"text":"I'm really glad my first experience of Malaysian food was here, because they truly live up to their name of being a tropical delight!  Being that it's take out only, the menu is short and sweet and really decently priced (most dishes range around the $10 mark)  An order of deep fried wontons, seafood laksa and fried noodles and we were on our way. The captivating smells of the food on the ride home make you even more excited to eat!  The portions are quite large, each dish can easily feed two people! The laksa is amazing here - notes of coconut tone down the spiciness just a touch and they don't skimp on the seafood.  I've been back a few times and haven't been disappointed (well except on Wednesdays when they're closed and I have a craving for Malaysian food lol)"}
{"text":"My most favourite takeout place in Calgary. Solid Malaysian food for reasonable prices (around $11 bucks per dish). Portions are large.   Beef rendang is delicious, laksa, tom yum soup and wat tan ho are some of our favorites. The family that owns it is very friendly and provide great service. They are closed on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"First time I ordered takeout from this place (they don't have a dining room).  I was pleasantly surprised how good it was.  I ordered the Curry Chicken Laksa Soup (#4), WonTon KoloMee (#9), Stir Fried White Flat Noodles with Sauce (Wat Tan Ho #11) and the Pancakes with Beef Rendang.  They were all good.  The laksa noodles were a bit soggy by the time I brought them home.  My kids loved the #9 and #11 because they are not spicy.  I loved the pancakes (roti)."}
{"text":"How can i live without you?!!! A n b r my fav go to. Owners super friendly n d menu is comprehensive. Best winter food ever!!!"}
{"text":"I wish this place was a sit down restaurant still but this hidden gem makes the best authentic laksa. It's definitely a must try and if you love spicy.. then this place will not disappoint.   I usually get the seafood laksa and their flavours are out of this world. Definitely worth the drive"}
{"text":"This place is just....so good!  Salivating while writing this.  The owners are wonderful, and the black pepper beef.  OMG."}
{"text":"Tropical Delight Noodle House is a Malaysian restaurant located in the industrial area right off McKnight Blvd on 12 St NE. This humble mom & pop serves up some delicious and legit Malaysian food, most notably, their wonderful curry laksa.   Lunchtime gets busy as they offer up a simple combo lunch menu featuring items such as their beef rendang. When I see diners come into a place like this and order the 'safe' items for the combo, I get anxious, wanting to recommend the laksa. Yes, it's all about the laksa here.  Laksa has a few regional versions and this one is one of my favourites. It's a big, hearty bowl of chewy rice noodles in a spicy coconut curry broth, pungent with the bold flavours of shrimp paste and their housemade spicy sambal that will slap your tastebuds. Add to that, some fried tofu to soak up that aromatic broth, fresh prawns, fishballs, and a glorious hard boiled egg and you're in business. This is one my top 3 favourite noodle soups right up there with shoyu ramen and pho.  If they decided to close up shop, open a street stall with just their laksa, I would be there in a heartbeat. Just give me a pair of chopsticks, a little plastic stool to sit on and stand back.   The sad thing is that they are all the way in the NE, and if you don't find yourself there that often, it's a shame. I love Tropical Delight and I hope that they are successful in sharing their beautiful culture and cuisine."}
{"text":"I had the laksa here today.  Wow, delicious.  I knew when I walked in this was going to be good;  there was a line (for takeout) and a good crowd in the restaurant (it was lunch time).  However, it was not overcrowded and we were seated quickly and eating almost immediately after placing our order.  Lunch was fast, cheap, and excellent.  I'll definitely be going back to try more things on the menu.  Be warned, the laksa is spicy!  It was full of perfectly cooked noodles, fish balls, faux-crab meat, and some other seafood, as well as tofu and something leafy.  Yum."}
{"text":"Review #7 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012.  Food: 3.5/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 Service: 3/5 Overall experience: 3/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  The Tropical Delight Noodle House is a mom and pops restaurant serving up traditional Malaysian food. It is fairly small with about 8 or so tables to one side and a large open area for takeout near the door. The decor could definitely use an upgrade; it reminded me of an old cafeteria. The servers were friendly and offered to answer any questions about the menu.  I would have never known about this place until my Malaysian friend mentioned it on a post online. She suggested trying their specialty, the \"Spicy Laksa Soup\" with shrimp, tofu, egg, fish balls, and rice vermicelli ($7.50). The dish is a good individual size. The soup was tasty ...the combination of heavy amounts of chili oil and coconut milk was unique, but I've had better spicy soups elsewhere. For the price and quality though, it will hit the spot if you're craving spicy noodles. If you can only handle mild spice, then this dish might be too spicy for you.  I also ordered the \"Nasi Lemak\" ($8.99) with coconut rice, anchovies, hard boiled eggs, sliced cucumber, Sambal Nanas (pineapple chili paste), and a choice of meat. I chose the Malaysian Beef Rending (other options were: black pepper beef, curry beef/chicken, sweet and sour pork, ginger beef, or satay chicken/beef). The Nasi Lemak is true home cooking. It was like something my mom would make for me on the weekend. There was a neat pile of lightly flavoured rice with a scoop of super tender braised meat. The flavour is quite hard to describe, but it was mild, with hints of coconut milk, ginger, and warm spices typically found in Asian/Indian cooking. The texture of the dish is similar to a thick stew (not like a watery curry).   The rest of their menu was minimal with other items like beef subs (~$6); spring rolls; tom yam or wonton soup ($7.50); and roti chanai with curry beef/chicken (~$9).  Overall, if you're looking for cheap home cooking or want to try new ethnic foods in the NE,, I recommend Tropical Delight Noodle House. The food was good but not really memorable. My friend on the other hand who is from Malaysia said the restaurant had the best Malaysian food in Calgary which I can't vouch for."}
{"text":"Excellent food especially beef rendang laksa and curry chicken. The owner is friendly. Prices are so decent, $10 for most dishes. Service is quick! Eat here if you like delicious authentic food."}
{"text":"Who would thought that I could find a small, family-owned, Malaysian restaurant in the middle of industrial jungle in north side of Calgary? Well, I did and I am glad that I did.  I had their Laksa today for lunch and it was one of the best laksa's I've ever had.  I grew up in Indonesia, and lived in Malaysia for a few years, so I am familiar and crave good South East Asian food once in a while and this one definitely hits the spot!  I will be going back tomorrow to try their Kolo Mee."}
{"text":"LAKSA LAKSA LAKSA!!!!!!! So darn delicious! The broth smells like heaven and taste like it too!!!!!!!! Small hidden gem in Calgary! Its a must try!"}
{"text":"Another quick update review.  It seems like they have corrected the shrimp issue from my last review.  I also found that the portions seemed to be slightly larger than before, which is always welcomed.  Added a star back."}
{"text":"I was told that this place would blow my mind.   In my opinion, the only thing it blew was chunks.  As a huge fan of noodles I found this place highly disappointing.    I recommend you don't go here.   If you do,  you won't pass go or collect $100.00  Or something.   Go eat pho at T&T if you want to live."}
{"text":"This place has been in my neighborhood for a few years and just tried it...I am truly glad I did not try it sooner.  It is sooooo good.  There is so much flavour and delicious.  The owner was so friendly and provided recommendations.  We had their signature dishes which are the beef rendang laksa soup and the stir fried egg noodles (MeeGoreng).  The soup is amazing and the noodles dish is fantastic as well.  Although the noodle dish was a little too spicy for me and I like spicy.  Potion sizes are huge and the price is great.  A must try!  I would recommend going there and ordering your food as it comes out very quickly.  This is takeout only.  Enjoy!  I know I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Don't trust amazing reviews of this place. They are pretty old. I used to buy my dinner from this place and it was pretty decent. But last week I bought the same dishes, they were nothing, but garbage! After having a few bites we all threw our meals away! The day after when I woke up as if I had slept in a trash bin. Terrible smell surrounded the kitchen! Only a few hours after eating that awful dish my stomach started aching! I can't believe I ate that garbage!"}
{"text":"So my cousin found this hidden gem in Hidden Valley. She brought #13 Spicy Stir Fried Egg Noodles and #3 Seafood Laksa Soup over for a girls lunch the other day and the four of us were pigging out. It was SO GOOD!!! That was on Friday.  Today (Monday, a few days later) I was craving it so bad that I ordered the #13 (MeeGoreng) and it was just as good as it was on Friday! They are like spaghetti noodles with a sweet tomato like sauce mixed with some Malaysian spicy sauce with eggs, bean sprouts, shrimp and fish balls. The flavour is unbelievable and spicy which I love. Delicious is an understatement. Wanted to order the Laksa Soup too but it would've been way too much food for one. Now I have leftovers for days. The portions are extremely generous as others have mentioned. There was four of us girls that Friday, and we still had leftovers.   The owner was very friendly, polite, and helpful. He suggested some other popular menu items and I'll definitely be back to try. It's \"Takeout Only\" and \"Cash or Debit Only\" which is fine."}
{"text":"I was so sad when this place closed but it has resurrected and is now located in the far north as a take-out only establishment.   They are known for their laksa and I ordered the seafood laksa along with the stir fried egg noodle with sauce (Wat Dan Mee) and stir fried rice (Nasi Goreng).  The fried rice was quite tasty and I wasn't crazy about the noodles, which were a bit hard but the sauce was good.  I remember the seafood laksa being better at the previous location though I'm sure it would've been great if I ate it at the restaurant rather than have it sit in my car for 20 minutes during the ride home.    I think I will definitely go back and give this place another try."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty! The owner was talkative and pretty interesting. He introduced us to a few tasty dishes. However, the dishes we ordered were all quite spicy. The portion size was not bad but definiteWill come back again for the tasty noodle!!!"}
{"text":"My dinner dilemma turned into a dazzling, delicious, deeeelightful experience thanks to Tropical Delight!   As the exhausting work week comes to an end, we've all been faced with the tiresome question of \"What's for dinner?\". Our thoughts float to the take out option.   While at a friends house in Harvest Hills on one of these said weeknights, he recommended Tropical Delight as his go to. I tried Tropical Delight at their previous location but couldn't remember much of the experience. I was also hesitant to give Malaysian cuisine another try after my poor experiences at Banana Leaf.   Oh man, I'm *SO* glad I didn't listen to myself.   It's a take out joint. The menu is short and sweet: about 20 items with different varieties of laksas (wonton, chicken, seafood, beef balls) and fried noodles and rice. Most of the items are $10.   The service was quick; we picked up our order of fried rice, and two laksas within ten minutes of ordering. The packaging was secure and nothing leaked.   For $10 a dish, you get A LOT food. The take out bowl couldn't even hold the laksa broth and noodles; I had to transfer them into one of my own bowls. The broth was fragrant and coconuty yet was not overpowering. Prepare for sniffles because it's also spicy. I'd say it's a 3/4 on a scale of 1-10. The toppings were generous, fresh, and I liked that the rice noodles were the thicker kind, like Asian spaghetti. The entire dish was the perfect mix flavors and texture.   I didn't get to try the fried rice. It was for my friend's dad and I didn't feel like he and I were close enough to share food. Sorry my social awkwardness failed you, Yelp. It smelled good though.   Tropical Delight is a welcome oasis in the middle of Calgary suburbia. They have restored my faith in Malaysian cuisine and I envy those who live close enough to relish the delightful experience on a regular basis. I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Malaysian has to be one of my favourite cuisines to eat. It seems I always want to hit up Banana Leaf every time I'm in Calgary because there's nothing like it back in Edmonton. However, they're not the only Malaysian spot in town as there's two others that I've yet to visit. I've known about Tropical Delight for far too long but their out of the way location and tough hours make it slightly difficult for out of town'ers to try.  Well, I finally was able to on a Sunday night before the long, fog filled car ride back home. They're located in a pretty deserted strip plaza where a Petro Canada and 7 Eleven reside. Random but a for sure good sign. This place is the quintessential definition of the word \"bare minimum\". Seriously, there is nothing inside except for three chairs and takeout menus. Pretty unfortunate that there's no room to sit but it's probably for the best. The heat inside from all the woks is seriously toasty.  - Curry chicken laksa soup (#4) ($10.00) - curry chicken, tofu, egg, lettuce and rice vermicelli. You choose the level of spice you want (from 1 to 10) and I opted for 7. The lady seemed slightly shocked but I assured her I could handle it. A level 7 has a good kick to it so be prepared, mentally and physically, for that. You won't die from it but your insides might be burning afterwards. I'd probably get a 6 next time. I like that they actually give you the level of spice that you want and don't tone it down. Not enough restaurants do that.  As for the laksa, the broth was tasty but not as rich, creamy and complex as Banana Leaf's laksa. However, the chicken curry was delicious! For $10.00, you get a lot of food - I had enough leftovers to eat the next day.  Wish I could have tried more items to do a better comparison but I can say with ease that I would definitely be back if I want Malaysian food to go. It's great that all their prices stated includes GST already so what's on their menu is the exact amount you pay! Legit. One last thing - make sure you bring either cash or debit to pay."}
{"text":"Fantastic Malaysian food.  Consistent quality.  Laksa and Beef Rendang are a must. I always boil the broth again when I get home; it makes the Laksa that much better. Trust me, it's worth the hassle. I also put the noodles into a proper bowl and not use the styrofoam or else you will most likely burn yourself."}
{"text":"I'm probably going to get a lashing from the Calgary foodie community who seems to be gaga for this place, but I just don't care for it! Yes, the laksa is flavorful, but the amount of grease in it puts McDonald's to shame (unless you're looking to flush your system out).  Fine, maybe the oil is part of what makes laksa, but couldn't you just add in a bit more than a few pieces of processed meat and iceberg lettuce?     I've given this place numerous chances in the hopes that because it's so close to me, it'll be better next time  but it just hasn't. I really wanted to love it and I've even tried multiple other things but the end result is the same - grease, processed fish balls, lacking fresh veggies and the need to drink copious amounts of tea to remedy the ensuing tummy ache."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times and have sampled the menu, its the real deal.  Tropical delight is a take out only Malaysian food place, one of its most famous dishes being the beef randang laksa noodle soup. The business is family owned and operated and they're always cheerful. Call in before you order and have some sort of large bowl at home to eat this!  The beef randang laksa is coconut based broth with cooked shrimp and satay to enhance it. It's not spicy at all, but you can ask for them to add spice to it (its sambal)"}
{"text":"Tried the beef rendang laksa soup. Absolutely fantastic with tofu, lettuce, egg, beef and a huge portion of noodles. The bowl was enough for two people. Soup was a bit greasy but you can skim it off. Broth was very flavourful.   Also ordered the Wat Tan Hor and was less impressed. The noodles were mushy and once the sauce was overly slimy for my taste.   I can't wait to try the chicken curry soup next time! Do note it's a take out place and they do an excellent job of wrapping everything so there's no spillage. Also loved the friendly man at the front counter, such good service with a smile!"}
{"text":"Very good laksa, and great beef rendang. It's a hard to beat combination. If you come at lunch, it can get a bit crowded but calling ahead for take outs solves that problem.   I knocked off a star for not accepting credit cards. Otherwise Tropical Delight is a 5/5."}
{"text":"One of my favourite lunch places... Try the beef Rendang ... Best I've had!  The couple who own and run the place are super nice as well.  A must try if you're into Malay food.  It's a small place but it's usually busy and packed at lunch.  They close early (5-5:30pm) so it's mostly a lunch venue.  The portions are generous and the flavour and aromas of the food titillate your senses.  The price is just right as you can stay within $10 usually."}
{"text":"They're bbbbbaaaaaaaack!! Tropical Delight closed down in the summer of 2014 at their old location but are now back in a Hidden Valley strip mall.  Although they've trimmed down to only do take-out orders, they've picked up some slack by adding more menu choices.   Among the changes to the menu that I noticed on my first visit back:  -Added more variety to the famous Laksa soup.  There is now curry chicken as well as wontons as a protein option.  This is in addition to the seafood and beef ball that they had before.  I haven't tried the new curry chicken laksa soup but sources say it's an excellent and different flavour.  My wife tried the wonton and she enjoyed it.  I stuck with my staple, the seafood laksa and it was exactly how I remembered it.  -The Mee Goreng is new to the menu.  It is a stir fried egg noodle dish with shrimp and sliced up fish balls.  The owner was so kind and was happy to see us back he gave us a sample to take home.  Upon first bite I was sold on the sweet and hot flavour of the sauce and the consistency of the noodles.  They weren't clumped up and stuck together.  The sauce evenly coated all the noodles.  -Beef rendang and other meats are now sold by the pound ($15/lb).  A good rule of thumb is to think of half a pound per adult.  The beef rendang was just as good as I had remembered.  Dinner last night was great!  All the tasty memories came flooding back.  As well, the owners of the place are the nicest I've ever met.  I don't only feel like a customer but a friend when I go to see them.  They aren't interested in getting rich, just being happy and making others happy with their food.  More people should think like that, especially other businesses in Calgary."}
{"text":"I liked that it felt like there was a big slow cooker in the back with delicious sweet beef simmering away and then they assembled the rice and put some great salty fried anchovy on top of the rice and I ate it happily. The rice was perfectly cooked and the beef was great. I could have eaten more but I liked that it didn't really fill me up. If you want more meat or more food you should probably order the plate with two items plus the rice. It's like a simple, not fancy hole-in-the-wall type restaurant with good food and happy positive servers."}
{"text":"Excellent food that is worth the drive. It is take out only where food is packaged with care.  What a great neighbourhood gem."}
{"text":"Yes, Tropical Delight Noodle House is INDEED OPEN again!  Today is their opening day.  The only difference is that it is a Takeout Restaurant.  The address is now changed as well:  10089 Hidden Valley Dr. NW, Phone: (403)-475-6886.  Ah Meng and his family are back!  I'm so happy to be able to eat Laksa, Beef Rendang and some new items like Mee Goreng and Char Kway Teow (Fried Flat Rice Noodles with Black Sweet Soya Sauce).    May I say I truly miss Tropical Delight?!?  The food item I missed the most was the Laksa.  That cream, spicy, red broth of coconutty laksa soup brings me back to Singapore!    I love the Char Kway Teow - it is so good!  Good value for your money.  Now, needs \"Hum\" (Manila Clams :0)  )  Oh, the Mee Goreng - it is so tasty!  The same taste as when I was growing up and buying Mee Goreng from the Indian hawker outside my house.  Gosh, memories!    My family and I will be back!  Kam Sia! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Decided to try something different at Tropical Delight: - Wor Wonton Laksa - just that delicious Laksa broth with loads of wonton, shrimp, fish balls, lettuce, imitation crab legs, tofu, 1/2 hard-boiled egg - no noodles - Chicken Curry Laksa - I understand from the owner, Ah Meng, that the laksa broth is mixed with chicken curry.  The broth is a little thicker than the straight laksa broth.  In addition to the usual laksa, all the trimmings and lai fen, there are 2 chicken drumsticks.  Very tasty!  Must eat with the sambal (chili sauce).    Of course, we had to have the Wat Tan Hor - flat rice noodle with the yummy gravy and the ever-delicious, Mee Goreng.   Thanks to Tropical Delight for a delicious dinner!  You're the best!  Super Shiok!"}
