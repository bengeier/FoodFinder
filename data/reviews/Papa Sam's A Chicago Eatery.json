{"text":"How tragic... we ordered two pies, zucchini and cheese sticks... Ugh the pies were soggy, zucchini was soggy and the cheese sticks Ugh... If that wasn't bad enough the lady at the counter was so bad... I'm going back to Ray's Pizza..."}
{"text":"Best service ever-  had a bad pizza being super salty let them know and they not only did they give us a free pizza on our next order but our meal we always get .  Best SERVICE.  Free pizza free wings and free soda.  Loyal customer always !!  Pizza amazing HONEY HOT wings the best.  Staff is all around the best !!"}
{"text":"I see lots of mixed reviews here but our Supreme Pizza on thick crust was the best pizza we've had next to Casey's taco pizza in Kansas! Crust had great flavor and cooked to perfection and loaded with toppings and lots of cheese, not sure what Chicago pizza supposed to taste like but we loved this one, wouldn't suggest to dine in though, very small area and too hot in there but employees friendly and didn't take long for our order, definitely will go back and order same!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing ! Grinders and the Poutine fries  almost had every sandwich on the menu it's all good"}
{"text":"The pizza just didn't taste that good. Other than that, I got two pizzas, one was overcooked - crust on bottom too hard and dry and cheese on top too brown. The other had a topping I didn't ask for, which probably doesn't sound that bad to most, but I find sausage disgusting and digging it out and loosing cheese is no fun. One of the pizzas was supposed to be \"double cheese\", but there was no difference in the amount of cheese between the two. ..... The service is not that great either, they were kinda rude on the phone."}
{"text":"Love this place. Finally a pizza you can eat and not feel stuffed afterwards. My daughter and I went there ordered the chicken margarita and Greek salad. Nice thin crust and crispy just like I like it."}
{"text":"We are new to the neighborhood. Ordered here for the first time for delivery. We had the Papa Italian sub with Onion Rings and the Gyro with a Greek salad. I ordered my gyro and salad very specifically and not only did it come right but everything was SO good. It was a lot of food for 2 people and we ate it all. We will order again! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great pizza but be careful if you order delivery the girl that takes your order will always screw it up"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever delivery driver forgot wing sauce was over charged pizza over cooked management was rude told them wouldn't return management didn't care not recommended"}
{"text":"Waited an hour and half for my chicken and they didn't call to inform me that my order which they said 45-50 mins. Prob the last time i oder from here. Spoke woth manager i he did nothing help me."}
{"text":"The pizza is very good. Great flavor! Be careful of the online menu. The prices aren't accurate, I was charged $1 more per item than advertised. It's only a few dollars but very misleading."}
{"text":"I have received delivery from this restaraunt three times.  The first two times went well and the food was very good...even once when they ran out of ribs and phoned me to ask if they could substitute broasted chicken for a half slab of ribs, the customer service was great and the chicken was really good.  However, the third time I ordered food from this location did not go so well.  I ordered an 8 piece chicken combo meal.  The menu advertises this meal as two of each piece of chicken (breast, thigh, leg and wing) and two sides, but that is not what I received.  I received 4 thighs, 3 legs, and 1 wing...yes that adds up to eight pieces of chicken but not as advertised on the menu and included no breasts.  Also, I ordered the macaroni salad as one of the sides...mind you this is for an eight piece combo dinner...I received one 3.25 oz container of macaroni salad, which is the size of one container of salad dressing.  The menu also states that the combo dinners are served with garlic bread, which was not included in the delivery.  I will reiterate the food is good thus the three star rating, but the attention to detail was not adequate.  I will order from this restaraunt again because the food is good....if the order comes as advertised on the menu, I will chalk this last experience up as a fluke and will improve my overall rating for this restaraunt."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it more but the pizza just didn't live up to the billing.  

The Good:
Wings were very good and super hot on delivery.  Right amount of sauce and tried the honey hot which had just enough kick to match the flavor.  Ranch was below average and put in the container so it was warm when it arrived.  Prices are fair.  Online ordering available and decent specials.

The Bad:
The pizza had ample toppings, but the crust wasn't quite right.  It lacked flavor and crunch.  For a Chicago thin crust it was on the doughy side.  I've had better, more consistent from Rosatis (which their menu looks like a knock off of) and still prefer Half Moon Windy City to all others in Phoenix.  

We will probably try them again and see if it improves."}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times, I was never disappointed. great pizza at a decent price; they are among the best.
I just don't understand the one star rating; it is like we are reviewing two different establishment."}
{"text":"Yup yup ....not bad at all ....thin crust pizza was damn near like home.  (Chicago)  Haven't tried anything but the pizza yet but plan too ....cost, service and pizza all on point !  Asset to the neighborhood !"}
{"text":"Pizza Science! Papa's food always tastes so good! It must be his personal touch, secret ingredients, and passion for excellence that makes his food addicting! I could eat Papa's food morning, noon, and night!  You must try for yourself! Highly Recommend Everyone to start from the top of Papa's Menu and try everything! Always coming back for Chicken Wings in my favorite tangy sauce, Calzones, Pasta w/homemade meat sauce, fried Zucchini, garlic bread, and always down for a slice of Pizza! Amazing Food!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Chicago thin crust pepperoni and hot wings. Was just ok. Nothing special. The crust was had a good flavor and had just the right amount of crunch. However it seems they skimped on the toppings. Was mostly crust and hardly any sauce cheese or pepperoni. 

The hot wings were big as I noticed another reviewer noted. However, they also had hardly any sauce on them. I found myself trying to scrape the bottom of the container for what little extra sauce there was. 

This place is right down the street from my  new home and it would have been great if I had a better experience. This could have been my go to take out pizza place. Not sure if I'll give them another try..."}
{"text":"Since it changed from Sam's to Papa Sam's I have ordered them 3 times, 1 time we picked it up for lunch which was VERY GOOD, and two times for dinner delivered BOTH times it took forever and BOTH times the pizza looked like it had slid around in the back seat and it was cold and rubbery.....it's too bad the night shift sort of ruined the place for us!"}
{"text":"This place is awful.
 
I ordered delivery and the man who brought me the food was a foreign who could barely speak English. He didn't have change for a $20 even though the people at the restaurant (I called) said he would have change. He started to yell at me and asked why I didn't have anything but a $20 bill LOL. I live in an apartment complex so we went down to the front office so I could ask for change. While we were heading there he started saying things to himself in his language, they were probably insults to me because for some reason he thought the situation was my fault. Nonetheless I get my change from the front office and I pay my order and, despite the awful service and rudeness he gave me, I tip him. He doesn't say anything and just gets in his car and speeds away. 

The food was just as bad as the delivery experience. Extremely cold and soggy onion rings, and the Philly cheese steak sandwich had a very weird spice flavor to it, which I did not like.

10/10 would never order from this sad excuse for a restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"That Italian beef sandwich is insanely good. Hands down best in town. Super friendly staff, specially Jason"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery over the phone.  Got a special of two hand tossed pizzas with 2 toppings each along with 30 wings, 3 different flavors, and a 2 litre of soda for $30!  I was expecting a \"get what you pay for\" dinner.  It was the best delivery we've had so far since moving to Phoenix.  Crust was crunchy and chewy.  The cheese was still stringy and melty all over the place when it arrived.  The wings were meaty and flavorful.  I can't complain about anything and will eventually give it a 5 star after i eat more of their food."}
{"text":"Under new management!!! Have been going here for pizza for a long time. Had the pizza tonight.... and no way man. They kept that name papa sams but changed the pizza. It use to be so fresh and delicious. Now you take a bite and the whole top slides off. The pepperoni are tasteless. The cheese is cheap. The sauce is tasteless. The dough is so hard. The best way I can describe the quality now is elementary school cafeteria pizza. Card board. Bring back the old recipe or Change the name because this is not papa dames pizza! Very sad!"}
{"text":"really good, I've had the greek salad twice and it's perfect. lots of olives & feta, dressing is good too. I had the Italian beef sandwich and the au jus is good enough to drink!! also ordered the cheese & pepperoni bread sticks and they were ok...blend of Moz and Cheddar? (some kind of orange cheese) and pepperoni, nothing too fancy but decent. ordered online through their website, delivery was within the time they promised.."}
{"text":"How is a pizza place out of pepperoni 

Seriously disappointing.

I'll try it again when I'm feeling a like cheese pizza."}
{"text":"We got a circular in the mail, and I checked out Yelp and saw some bad reviews. But then I noticed most of the bad reviews were made by people who were too lazy to go get their own food and wanted it delivered. My Wife and I ordered for self pick-up. Their Pizza and Wings were OUTSTANDING. We got the Honey Hot Wings, they were crispy, saucey, and cooked to perfection. We also got a large thin crust sausage & pepperoni Pizza that was hot and full of flavor. Since Papa Sams is so close to my house, this will be my new GOTO Pizzeria."}
{"text":"It's hard to make bad pizza, but Papa Sams makes bad pizza. You take a bite and the cheese slides off in a sheet of cheese. It almost like the cheese isn't even baked on there but microwaved? I tried it twice to see if maybe I got a bad pie, but they were both terrible. Chicago style? I think not."}
{"text":"First timers eating from here and the pizza was DELICIOUS! Ordered for pick up because we're so close. We ordered hand tossed and the crust was amazing. We will definitely be ordering from Papa's again!"}
{"text":"I have seen this place change owners several times. The new owner, Jason, has stayed true to old man Sam's recipes. It's newly remodeled, the staff is super friendly and they have great food! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings. Very good Chicago dogs. Good ones are hard to find outside of Chicago."}
{"text":"To whom it may concern, 

I ordered, online, a 10 inch Meat Lovers pizza and 6 wings at 3:24pm on November 1, 2017. I was quoted an hour delivery time, which was ok with me. The order was delivered within the time frame at approx 4:30. I paid cash. Once I opened the pizza box, I realized the order was wrong. The pizza was only cheese. I immediately called back and spoke with a representative who said that he was very sorry and that next time he would take care of it. I told him that I didn't want it to be taken care of next time - that I wanted a new pizza (the correct pizza) and I was willing to wait for the time it took for the delivery. I waited until almost 530 for the delivery, which never showed up. I called back and spoke with another representative (who gave me the name Frank) and he said he had no idea what was going on, that he just arrived to work etc etc etc. I asked him if the pizza was in the works, to which he replied again that he had no idea what was going on. He said he was very busy and didn't have time to handle this. He continued to interrupt me and then hung up on me TWICE. TWICE!!  I called back, he didn't answer. Then he called me back and said \"I have the game going on, I'm very busy, I don't have time for this.\"  I did ask him who the manager was to which he said there isn't a manager. I asked him for the owners name to which he said his name is \"Jason\". 

\"Eat Street\" called at 6:05pm saying that PapaSams called them and said they are making another pizza and will be returning my $$. The total was $22.18 and I gave the delivery driver a total of $25.00. 

I have been in the restaurant business for over 17 years and NEVER have had an experience like I had tonight with your establishment. I will never return nor will I recommend this store to anyone. The customer service was absolutely horrendous and disrespectful and uncalled for. 

I asked \"Frank\" for his managers information. He said he was the only one there. Frank needs a lesson in guest relations, as that is actually what his job title is and entails. 

(The pizza just showed up @630 but it is COLD)

Best regards, 
Kristen"}
{"text":"Wow - what a steep drop in quality! So disappointed in our pizza last night. We hadn't ordered from here in a while and decided to give it a try since we had loved it in the past. Bad idea.

We ordered a 14 inch sausage and pepperoni and there was maybe 7 pieces of sausage on the whole pizza, heaps of flavorless sauce and a light dusting of cheese that didn't even come close to the edges - the outer ring of slices were pretty much only bland crust and tasteless sauce.
We also got a 16\" mushroom and sausage/pepperoni. This one did have more cheese and a fair amount of sausage still, the heavy hand of bland sauce just killed any flavor. It was almost like a pasta sauce instead of a pizza sauce (yes there is a difference). Plus, the crust on this one was doughy/undercooked and sorely needed simple salt and pepper.

Wings (12 garlic parm. & 12 hot) looked the part yet were dry/overcooked. Bummer.

I'm not sure what happened here but, after spending nearly $50 we will have to look elsewhere for our chicago pizza fix..sorry guys.."}

Service is so good and food is so amazing litterly the best i am obsessed 10/10 recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place has 8 chairs and 80 menu items.  They seem primarily setup for to-go and takeout.  The food was good, but the way you order it makes a big difference in price.  Pay attention to the combos and specials."}
{"text":"Our first time trying and we were not impressed. We ordered dinner at 5:30 and was told 45 min to an hour. An hour and a half later we still had not received our food. I called to ask and did not even get an apology but was told the driver was on their way. We live about 10 min away and a half hour later the driver finally got there. The fries were cold and the sand which was nothing special. My husband liked the calzone but that was it. Staff definitely needs a course in customer service"}
{"text":"Place has gone way down hill, was a favorite of ours for years but recently has been gross! 

Pizza lacks flavor, honestly do yourself a favor and get a frozen pizza from the store. Will taste much better trust me. 

Wing sauce was so nasty, hard to even describe but the flavors are way off. Won't be back. Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and Italian food.  Love the new owners."}
{"text":"Unfortunately i cant bring myself to give this place a 5. The pizza was very flavorful. Very hearty on the sauce and cheese. 
The wings were pretty good. Meaty and saucy. Ranch could be better ( home made). I liked the honey hot. 
Now to why this isn't getting a 5 
The baked fries buffalo chicken tenders. 
What? More like greasy sauce, over cooked tenders, mushy fries. I think i got a F'D up stomach from those freaking fries. Kind of mad about spending all that money and my fries (only thing i was eating) was inedible. I Ate a few bits, my bf ate a few bites. The flavor was on point but the consistency was not. Then we were like, i dont like those tenders. Still ate them because we are stoners who dont waste food. I am regretting that now. I would love to call and complain but my bf wont let me. He gets embarrassed. I SPENT 29.52 on your so so food. Id like to be credited or refunded."}
{"text":"We recently moved from California and searched for our next favorite pizza place. Well, we found it at Papa Sam's! Awesome, delicious pizza consistent every time. We've tried hand tossed and thin crust - both are good depending on your preference. Since discovering Papa Sam's, I would never call a chain restaurant.  We've also had Greek salads which were yummy and calzones - excellent!  My 84 year old mom said tonight, \"darn this is delicious pizza!\" That says a lot coming from her - believe me :) We highly recommend this restaurant! From, Melissa Morgan"}
{"text":"Just not good. I've ordered delivery twice. Bread was so burnt I threw it away. Sandwich stale,  coleslaw gross. Fries were good.  Wings soggy."}
{"text":"The overall experience was quite poor.

We had:
Italian grinder
2 Chicago dogs
Some salad
Italian beef

First of all, I'm from Chicago. I'm used to a specific standard. That being said, I didn't expect this place to meet that standard because no where except portillos does (outside of Chicago)

But this was bad.

The hot dogs are NOT Vienna. The hot dogs were prepared incorrectly, and the first one I got looked like it had sat in the sun for 3 days and then was microwaved. Sonic has a better Chicago dog. Seriously. Though I will say the bun was pretty good.

The Italian beef was cooked in the oven I think. It was not very good at all. I asked for it dipped, and was told they could do that, but instead they just dumped a little bit of gravy on it.

The grinder was heated up. Nothing is more gross than subpar quality deli meat thrown in a microwave (not even that hot dog).

The best part about the meal was the fries."}
{"text":"Ordered several items for delivery.
Delivered quickly.
Food was hot.
Food was just ...Meh.
This is my note to self not to order from here again.
Far better tasting food at the same price elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delivery was on time. But I'm not sure if my order was correct. I ordered medium wings but they were pretty spicy! But even if it was accidentally hot I still loved them! So much flavor."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worse experience on a delivery order. Person on the phone said 20 mins. Thought that was unreasonable, but ok. Will give it 40 mins. 90 mins latter! I called them, \"it's on its way.\" Another 30 mins, called back and cancelled order.  I understand it's a Friday night, busy busy busy. But you HAVE  to be reasonable on delivery time. Especially on a order of 50$ plus. Person on the phone was short and long on attitude.  I absolutely hate stiffing a delivery guy their tip, I know how hard it is. Ripped up the menu. Never again."}
{"text":"Can't speak to the service as I ordered online. Delivery was fast and food was hot. However, the quality of the food left a little to be desired. The pizza didn't have much flavor (ordered Chicken Margarita), the salad was really boring and they had used sliced processed American cheese on it, blech! The wings were the highlight, we ordered hot and honey BBQ but got spicy BBQ instead. They were good but disappointed the order was wrong. And it was expensive, so we'll probably will just stick with Barros for future pizza delivery."}
{"text":"We has the chicken parm, pizza and meatballs. The sauce and meatballs were delicious. The thin crust meat lovers was amazing. The new owners have done a wonderful job with the place. Love that it is a dine in now. SECOND TO NONE!! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"We order from there regularly. Jason always gives us great pizza deals. The pepperoni sandwich is fantastic."}
{"text":"by far one of the best pizzas i had. i had a great experience. i enjoyed the staff and how kind they where to me and my kids. we will definitely be coming back soon"}
{"text":"The first time we ate there we walked in and got a large one topping for 8$. It was good and we wanted to try it again.  
This time I ordered online, which ends up going through a third party.. After I dealt with the difficult website and finally ordered and paid, I got a call about 30 minutes later from a rep of the third party telling me that the owner had called telling them he didn't have a delivery driver that day. Pick up wasn't an option for me at that time, so I cancelled my order and they refunded me. I was disappointed and hungry. 
So a few weeks later I decided to try one more time. I had to call three times before someone even answered the phone. He was rude and had sub-par customer service. Didn't even ask my name. I chose delivery, they had a driver that day.  I got a pizza and a sandwich. Each were 7.99$ but somehow my total was 24$ and I was not given a receipt or explanation why. The driver didn't speak English so he couldn't even tell me.  He was nice. 
The food was OK.  My \"chicken, bacon club\" was cut up chicken nuggets and pieces of bacon.  It was ok.  The pizza was OK as well.  I probably won't order from them again."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Chicago.  This place is the closest I have found to Chicago pizza.  Plus they have a broasted chicken that is out of this world!!  His Veal Parmesan is the best also!  I highly recommend this place for all the food.  I have not had a bad meal from here yet.  When this new owner took over, he was a bit slow in getting things going.  But now our food arrives in 35 minutes tops and is always great!!  Give this place  a try.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Although the pizza was tasty, it was pretty pricey, and we didn't get what we ordered.   We were ordering \"healthier\"  pizzas,...I know that sounds funny, but we usually order meat lovers or pepperoni  items.   We ordered  1/4 of the sausage on one pizza and  a chicken margarita pizza.    For the Margarita pizza....The menu says grilled chicken, however after we got home, the chicken on the pizza was clearly fried chicken strips that were chopped up and put on our pizza.  (old order not served and they wanted to use supplies?)  Very turned off by that."}
{"text":"It was a decent pie, not great by any means but about what you would expect from a take out pie. Staff was very friendly, and everything was ready quickly enough.

I dont think the cheese is very good to be honest. The buffalo sauce I asked for was great.

Can't eat in, the dining area is to small to be comfortable."}
{"text":"This is probably the best pizza we have had delivered in the Deer Valley area. The quantity of food you get for the price is appropriate. The mild sauce for the wings tasted much more \"ketchupy\" than most but had different yet good flavor. The Caesar salad had shaved parmesan instead of grated so that was a nice surprise. The food was delivered quickly and our special modifications were done correctly. I would order from them again."}
{"text":"Worst pizza slice i ever had,
Very little cheese , very dry crust, 
What offend me is  they using the Chicago name, and  not even close to Chicago food, what a fraud,

I would have a frozen tombstone then this place,
Hope this review helps, if not you'll find  out yourself,"}
{"text":"Food is gross, waste of money, time, and appetite. Will never return. I couldn't believe I wasted money on this terrible food. Customer be aware, you will be very disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome thin cracker crust pizza. Toppings are very fresh tasting. Also highly recommend the cannoli. Been looking for a neighborhood pizza place that I could regularly call for delivery and I think I finally found it. Very nice people towards customers as they offered to take our pizzas out to the car which was very unusual but all very friendly. Nice experience and really tasty Pizza."}
{"text":"New, not so friendly owners from Chi-town.  They get mad if you ask about Pizza on sale!  I'm really not sure what happened here?  I placed an order on Saturday night with not a soul in sight,  the lady asks if I want hand tossed or thin.  I say thin and receive hand tossed.  She asks what toppings I would like.  I say pep and sausage.  I receive a pizza with bacon on it?  French fries were burnt that came with my Italian beef sandwich.  I will say the pizza is better under new ownership."}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for a long time.  This place has the BEST pizza, I think it is the best in the area.  I will no longer be ordering from Hungry Howies or anywhere else around here.  Their Italian Beef is delicious too!"}
{"text":"The most terrible service I have ever experienced, ordered food from them, first off the woman that took my order was SO FLIPPIN RUDE! Then they tell me it will be 35 minutes....2 hrs later they showed up to my door (which I live right down the street from them) with cold food in hand...I said \"I'm not paying for that, you guys are 2 hrs late and the food is cold\" the delivery guy looks at the food and says \"Soooo, you don't want it?\" Smh horrible horrible first experience."}
{"text":"I rarely, if ever, write a review the first time we try a new place. Papa's was no exception, and twice now I've had some of the best pizza in the neighborhood. 

We have family in from Illinois, they wanted pizza, so I thought I'd throw them for a loop and get the same Chicago style thin crust they get just blocks from their house.

It worked, they couldn't tell the difference and my order was delivered quickly, the pizza/wings were hot, and all is well. Think most people are quick to offer up their negativity, but are short with compliments. I've got nothing but good things to say about Papa's!!

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Wow! Real Chicago food in Glendale. I stopped by as I was shopping for a motorcycle helmet and noticed the Vienna Beef umbrella and thought I'd give it a try. The pizza was perfect. It tasted great and the crust was nice and crisp. I highly recommend this place and I'm glad they deliver! They also have really gear lunch specials."}
{"text":"I ordered online for pick-up using their website and not only was the wait time inaccurate but the order was incorrect and the customers service was so so poor. 

Customer Service 
When I placed the order online requesting pick-up I ordered the Broaster Chicken (4 piece) and I asked for dark meat only the Family appetizer sampler with ranch dressing. When I confirmed the order I received an email however it does not tell you the projected wait time and had a number at the bottom to call if i had questions( kind of defeats the purpose of online ordering to me). I called and the lady who answered verified the name on my order and stated it would be about 20-25 minutes so I waited 20 and then headed over since it was about 5 minutes away. I entered the very small 2 table restaurant and waited while a family w children was eating ,I promise no exaggeration,  at least 5 minutes before one of the women from the table stood , approached me and asked me if I needed help. I told them I was there to pick-up to which the women went to the back. The a man came out and said \"you here for pick-up? What did you order cause I don't see names here?\" After me reading what I order to him he said it was not ready and would be another 5 minutes for the chicken. That 5 minutes turned to 10 minutes and while I was waiting the women came in to ask me to pay. After paying and taking the order home I opened the box to find 2 Breasts and 2 drumsticks, so I called immediately. I explained that I received white meat instead of dark and she said \"hold on\" and put me on hold for 5 minutes because I was still on hold pulling into their parking lot again. She came back on to ask if I wanted a credit or from the to remake, to which I replied neither and I would prefer to return and get a refund.  I tried to explain to the young lady working the counter what this experience was like and she never apologized and just began to walk to the back after giving me the refund. 

The Food
I cannot give you my honest opinion of the food because I returned it for a refund without touching it. I can say however the sampler basked looked like it was all covered in the same batter and was a little dark. The chicken was hot and looked crispy cause I could feel in through the box but I don't see how it couldn't since that's what I was apparently waiting for.

Final Thoughts
Based on the reviews and my personal experience I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemies. I left with a bad taste in my mouth and never even tasted the food."}
{"text":"Lowest rating I've ever given out. I ordered online with a lot of advance notice for delivery. The restaurant is 13 minutes away according to google maps. Food arrived 45 minutes late. The wings were soggy and without much flavor, I ordered Dr. Pepper and they brought Diet Coke, the fries were soggy and cold and the hotdog tasted slightly undercooked and the bun was soggy and fell apart when I tried to pick it up. Pretty disappointed as I was pretty excited to find a Chicago food place in the area, but not worth it by any standard. Save yourself some time and money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great wings & Pizza! I've been coming here for about a year now, and love the food. It is a small business, so of course their prices are a bit higher.. I often get 12 wings for 10-12 bucks here, and am never disappointed. My fiancée loves the pizza and since making this my regular spot for wings, we have moved about 10 miles away.. The distance isn't a factor when it comes to quality, we'll continue to come here, support the small business."}
{"text":"You can ignore Nicholas H's review. He clearly only visited Chicago and someone introduced him to deep dish or something. 95% of Chicago pizzerias make thin cracker like crust and use corn meal. They also cut it in squares, called pub style or sometimes party cut. If you like Papa John's you may no t like this. It's more like Rosati's."}
{"text":"Does Not Have Chicago Style Pizza!!! 

It only has thin crust, Chicago is known for Deep Dish Pizza and lady was really confused when we were asking for Deep Dish Pizza. Do not go here if looking for Chicago style deep dish pizza"}
{"text":"Ordered for first time from this place, delivery was supposed to be an hour. It's been hour and ten min and still don't have my food. Called to find status and all dude says was my driver is on the way and hung up. Needless to say this is the last time I patron this establishment."}
{"text":"First time I have ever ordered from here and will probably be the very last time. I had my food delivered so I didn't expect it to be piping hot, wasn't expecting it to be frigging cold either. Nothing sucks more then getting cold fries and the cheese isn't melted anymore I ordered the mama fries a cheese steak sandwich and hot wings all cold like not even put under a heat lamp or on top of the pizza oven to keep shit semi warm. Bad part is I ordered thru grub hub amd left a 5.00 tip on top of the already embedded 2.50 delivery fee. 
Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Well if u want the runs the night of and the next day excellent choice ! The pizza itself from a \" Chicago style pizzeria\" was nothing of Chicago style if u have ever been there .

{"text":"White pizza is great! Went in for pick up and noticed the expansion. Decided to dine in since the baseball game was on. Good service, fun night."}
{"text":"My culinary experience was not that delightful. I ordered the \"Sweet Chili Chicken\" sub with grilled chicken and extra-crispy fries. First, the fries did not arrive extra-crispy. Second, my order was delivered to me in a plastic \"to go\" bag, even though I was dining in. Third, the chicken and iceberg (yuk) lettuce proceeded to ooze out of my sandwich with each bite, so I asked the staff for a fork. I was told by the sweet young lady working behind the counter that she could not find a fork. What? No forks in a restaurant? HOWEVER, the man that came in immediately after me ordered a salad, and guess what he was given with his salad? That's right folks, a pre-wrapped cutlery pack with a napkin and a plastic fork! Fourth, tables were not clean. In fact, the red and white checkered table cover on the table where I sat between the door and service counter was filthy dirty. Fifth, Papa Sam was no-where to be found. It appears to me that this is not a family owned Italian pizzeria, but simply a financial investment."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place?! My wife and I moved here from the Midwest and quickly found this place. The pizza is great (thin crust) and always a family favorite. Always cooked perfectly and full of flavor! Staff is also very friendly when I pick it up. Must say, our favorite pizza joint.

{"text":"Pizza - what's up with the dough? Not a fan of the crust at ALL.
We ordered two pizzas and got an order of wings.

We still have one and a half pizzas leftover.
The wings were pretty decent though!"}
{"text":"I hate to do this. I do. Because I was ecstatic I found another good place to fill my belly. But unfortunately the past few times, the quality of the food has been bad.

I don't know what gives! I've ordered pasta previously and it was amazing! And although it came in a tin container the presentation was great. Penne pasta, sauce on top. Unmixed. With cheese and parsley. The way it should be at your prices!

The most recent order, the pasta was way over cooked. Most of it was broken. And the sauce was so watery and it was all mixed up with no cheese. 

Also, I ordered their BBQ wings...the sauce made me want to puke! It was sour! It didn't taste like BBQ sauce at all. It even smelled sour.. Ive ordered your wings before, and they were perfection. No other words to describe them. They were crispy, and they had plenty of sauce. 

And if you're going to charge almost $5 for a piece of frozen tirimisu...it should at least look decent...

And they changed their portions as far as the poutine goes. In the past Ive paid $6 for poutine and got a huge circular tin of it. This time, the tin is half the size and its hardly even full.

Lastly, the fried zucchini. Zucchini is NO where near being expensive. So you charge $5 for (I shit you not) 5 strips of fried zucchini?? That's crazy.. I used to get a least a handful or so from you guys. 

I waited a long time to give an update. We used to order from these 1-2 times a week. Cause I was really hoping that these guys were just having a rough patch.. But it appears another gem in the rough lost its sparkle. 

Im done with these guys."}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery. I ordered the chicken philly, the antipasto salad and garlic bread. 

After about an hour, no food yet, I called the restaurant. I was told the driver said no one was home. I figured he went to the wrong address. The lady on the phone said she would call him. After another 10 minutes and still no food, I called back and was told the driver returned to the restaurant. I asked that he return, but to please remake the sandwich. The driver showed up after 75 minutes with the food. When I answered the door, the driver immediately went into a rant about his experience. He lied when he said he heard my large dog bark the first time he tried to deliver. The dog was by my side the entire time. 

The sandwich was decent. Not great, but okay. The salad dressing was missing and the garlic bread (6 pieces $2.99) was actually a gross pizza thing. 

I regret wasting $23, but I will not make the same mistake again."}
{"text":"This pizza was delicious, ordered the pepperoni sausage and mushroom almost ate it all bye self. Owner is very professional, great pizza guys!"}
{"text":"Been a frequent customer to Papa Sam's and was pleasantly surprised by their expansion of the restaurant. Had a great three item pizza which was their special for 899... Great flavor"}
{"text":"Had to-go 4 times now. Its really hit or miss. Thursday -Saturday Evenings I won't order. However mid day weekends and weekdays I'm happy with papa's .  First order on par. Delivered everything  I asked for. Gave me hope. Ordered again 75% of my order was wrong. Or didn't include  additions I payed for. Time after same result. However I ordered wings and onion  rings mid day on a Sunday 8/23 and they delivered my order and then some. Was just as happy with them as the first time I ordered.  If they could bring me this quality every time I had ordered food I would give them 5/5."}
{"text":"Thought I would try this place since it was in the neighborhood, needless to say I will not be going back ever again. Terrible customer service, girl at the counter was no help and seemed annoyed she had to her job. Worst white pizza I have ever had and the wings were under cooked. Prices too high for the poor quality food $31 for medium pizza and 18 wings."}
{"text":"Gave it 5 stars because price match the quality and I have to say it wasn't that bad... mushroom and pepperoni pizza had flavor and was filling and was for a good price.  Have I had better?... yes.  But it was worth what I spent."}
{"text":"The Italian Beef was Awesome! I ate 1/2 for dinner and 1/2 the next day for breakfast. The delivery driver was really nice and everyone's food was hot!
Thanks for dinner! We'll order again!"}
{"text":"I don't think they even deserve 1 star... last time we ordered delivery they messed up our order, missing sauces which wasn't too big of a deal but they were apparently out of some ingredients and instead of calling to let us know, they substituted the items and it was horrible. I called to complain and Emma said that we would have a discount on our next order. I tried to place an order and the person had no notes in the system about the issue or discount and Emma no longer works there. No apology or anything to try to make it right. Definitely will not be going back there!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I have tried it all from the pizza, Chicago dogs, wings, and desert etc. and I have never been more satisfied with a restaurant. The food is always hot and fresh and they are always on time with deliveries. And the whole staff treat me and my family like royalty. Definitely a place to go to if you are ever in the Phoenix/Glendale area."}
{"text":"So far the girl that is taking the orders does not like job.  You have to get her to answer questions. We ask how many cannoli in order and she just looked at us and say I don't know and just stood there and looked at my wife. It wasn't until my wife said can you please ask.  She made a face like OMG.  I haven't even tried the food and I already have a bad taste of this place."}
{"text":"So I had a craving for some good wings and found  this place on yelp ! Thought I would test my luck and give it a try.  I ordered online for pickup seeing it was nearby. 
It is kind of tucked away in a corner of a strip mall and when you walk in, it is surprisingly  very tiny, BUT DON'T  be mistaken  ! I haven't  even finished my wings and stopped  to write  a review. I got the  medium flavor...and  man! Are they good! 
I suggest trying this place."}
