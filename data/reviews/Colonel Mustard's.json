{"text":"The one star is for the friendly waitress and alright service. 

Where to start...

OK maybe one point five but no half star ratings on yelp.

Went for a family meal here. And was not too impressed.

Most restaurants offer free refills on their sodas, or even if you need to pay, they ask if you would like another drink, but our cups ran dry, half way through our meal, and stayed that way. Our server was not super busy, she spent a considerable time socializing with a table right by us.

Food was at our table in a timely manner. But...

Wife - she was impressed by the gluten free menu, and had no complaints on the schnitzel.

But...

My son had the kids burger. A little charred for a child. And the bun it was served on was stale, hard as a rock. It seemed as though the burger was burnt (cooked) earlier and reheated in a nuker, based on how hot it was in the middle, steaming hot, he had to wait a bit to eat some of it as it was way too unnaturally hot.

I had the caeser salad and daily special of the ribs. Definitely was not impressed. The salad, advertised with real bacon bits, was served like that, but they were burnt to a crisp. And I was wondering which there was more of, the dressing or the powdered parmesan dumped on the salad. It was drowned in dressing. Overkill. And it seemed the lid may of fell off the cheese shaker, or something of the sort. A horrendous  heaping of powdered parmesan to drown the burnt bacon and swimming salad. 

Now the ribs, big and beefy. They looked appetizing. But... Someone needs to tell the cook you need to remove the membrane from the back of the ribs or at least 'score' it. The proper way is to remove it altogether. It was a struggle to get the meat, as the membrane binds it, and the fats don't cook through, rendering the meat a bit too chewy still. But... The icing on the cake was the ribs tasted as though they cooked a piece of fish right on top of them. A tad off putting. 

I had read great reviews about this small franchise (I think there are three of them) and was looking forward to trying this, and ended up walking out disappointed. 

But like I mentioned off the start, our waitress was friendly and the service was alright 

May revisit either this location or another one. Eventually.  But with many other restaurants to sample and a primarily negative experience, I know I won't be rushing back any time soon."}
{"text":"The worst food I've Ever had!  The cottage pie (sheppards pie) was disgusting....very dry with no gravy and the mash potato topping was horrible wallpaper paste...the mushroom soup was lumpy and the wings were very plain....none of the food had any seasoning what-so-ever....had to use half a bottle of salt to add flavour! On the plus side the long island ice tea is really good made from scratch."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. The food was absolutely disgusting and the service was pretty bad too. The portions are extremely small for what your paying for and it tastes horrible too. The drink glasses smell like moldy drying towels and the place looks like is hasn't been properly cleaned in awhile. It also gave everyone a stomach ache afterwards. Avoid this place, eat somewhere else"}
{"text":"With the exception of the friendly service, the food here was lacking. More specifically, their wings, which is a shame considering it was their wing night.  

The size of the wings were nice and big however they were not properly cooked.  Flats weren't bad but the drums were way overcooked and dry.  Even with sauce, it was still dry.  2/5.

Note to Management: Kindly advise your cooks to fry the wings about 3 to 4 minutes less for the right amount of juiciness and crisp.  Trust me."}
{"text":"Always enjoy coming here. Great food. Nice friendly staff. Good atmosphere. My kinda place. My kinda people. My kinda food. My kinda beer on tap. 
If I could change anything. Maybe a bigger better desert selection. Maybe a half pitcher available. 
Otherwise perrrrrrfect !!! 
Looking forward to next time."}

2.5 rating

Apparently under new management. Checked online it still says 79 cent wing on their website but menu says 99 cent.

The environment feels the same, the food seems a bit better, the service doesn't seem like it changed much.

Came on a game night, it was a 45min wait time at St. Louis but no wait here. 

They have a good variety of Molson beer on tap.

Tuesday is 99 cent wing night with a purchase of a beverage. Dine in only and does not include carrots and celery sticks due to the special. The wings were ok sized but dry. I felt like my wings were re-fried.

The service was okay. Wasn't greeted when I came in and waited for my seat. 

The bathroom is downstairs.

Overall if it's game night and I don't want to wait for a beer and some wings I'd come here but won't expect too much."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of this place at all. It seems to have a crew of surly regulars, and the food is sub-par pub fare. The tables were sticky and the washrooms were dirty -- this is not \"good divey;\" it's just a dive in a plaza."}
{"text":"This is a local pub in my area that I have been to a few times now.  A warm atmosphere accompanies very tasty, reasonably priced food.  Most importantly to me is that this restaurant is totally wheelchair accessible!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch a few months ago.  It's very run down and can use a complete makeover.  Wallpaper is peeling off, electrical wires hanging out of wall, holes in wall, ripped chairs..

Food was average, typical pub food that won't have you saying \"wow\".  Our server was attentive and friendly.

To end, good service, average food."}
{"text":"3.5 stars, but I can't give halves. This place is 2 blocks from where my boyfriend lives, so at the end of a long day at work, this place is the go-to.

ATMOSPHERE
Yeah, the decor is outdated. Honestly, that doesn't bug me, but if you're looking for a a gorgeous place to eat, you shouldn't be at a pub anyway. 

CLIENTELE
This would probably be what turns me off the most, but honestly, it's not the Colonel's fault. This is Highway 7 and 9th Line... a place where not too long ago was pretty much farm land. These people aren't Bay Street bankers. So I can't blame them for getting a little rowdy, loud, and wasted. In fact, I'd prefer rowdy, loud, wasted suburbanites to rowdy,loud, and wasted 20-somethings at a club downtown. 

SERVICE
There are some really great servers here (maybe 2), but some are really awful. The good ones you can tell have worked there a while, can list the drink menu at the drop of a hat, and ordering is a breeze with them. Once in a while, you get someone who can answer none of your basic questions about the menu. But again, not high on my priority list when it comes to a go-to late-night pub meal. If I want great service, I'll go somewhere where I'm paying more money,

PRICE
This is what gets us to come back over and over. For an app, 2 meals, dessert, and 2 drinks, the tab is in the low $50 range. Awesome. 

FOOD
For what we are paying, the food is great. The soups are PHENOM, and homemade. HOWEVER, I hated their French Onion Soup... no bread, too much cheese, and they add brandy to the broth, which to me tastes awful. But seriously, every soup of the day that they've had was great. And we have always enjoyed our meals. Cottage pie is to die for.

Dessert - white chocolate cheesecake with raspberry coulis is probably the best thing that has ever entered my mouth (no inappropriate jokes, please).

FINAL REMARKS
Never go on a holiday. We were here on Monday for St. Paddy's Day, sat down at 7:55. Ordered at 8:10..... DIDN'T GET OUR FOOD TIL 9:20. I get it, they were busy. And considering this was the first time this had ever happened (and we are here at least twice a week), I let it slide. But we will not come back on St. Paddy's again."}
{"text":"Tues wing night either all-you-can-eat at $14.99 or 79Â¢ each.  10 flavours to choose from."}
{"text":"Colonel Mustard's is a popular bar in Markham, and for those that want to stay local this would be one of your choices.
Its nothing fancy, but your typical bar that serves up some pints and pub fares. They're known for their music karaoke nights on the weekends.  In terms of foods I've had their nachos which were 'alright', however wings are quite good.  The service ranges from good to terrible, depending on how busy it is. 
This place is more of a dive bar, but its popular since its always crowded. 
In terms of cleanliness, its about a 2.5/5."}
{"text":"The pub that time forgot. Hunter green outdated decor, stickey menu that has never been wiped down in years.Was there at dinner time, Monday night 5:30 to 6:30 and there was only 12 people of which 3 of them were regulars up at the bar drinking. When I walked in it was like walking into Miss Kitty's saloon on gun smoke.People looked at and others turned around and gawked at you.
Ordered the teriyaki salad, took 15 mins to get, after 1 bite I was asked by the manager\bartender how it was.
I advised her that the greens were fresh, the chicken was good but the salad was Luke warm, and not cold. Temped.
No response back from her whatsoever.If you ask I will be honest. Delivery of my response could not have been moe diplomatic.
I had to ask for my bill once I got sick of the empty plate in front of me, and I walked out after tipping 1.95 on a 19 dollar tab.
Do yourself a favour, go to Tim's next door and have a Caen and fresh sand which. No surprises"}
{"text":"Typical pub fare. Service is a bit shotty. It took a long time for us to flag down a server, and when we finally did, she told us she wasn't our server.. waited another 5 minutes for our server to come help us.

We ordered wings and fries, the wings were good. Meaty and delicious. We got lemon pepper and salt and pepper. I don't really like saucy wings and these were a great alternative. Our fries never came.. but at least it never showed up on the bill."}
{"text":"We ordered from the brunch menu.  The omelette tasted quite acceptable.  I switched the house fries to salad.  The waitress didn't have an issue.  The salad was fresh.  BF ordered a beef pie with salad.  He said it tasted okay.  The portion of both was reasonable as lunch.

The decoration is dated yet clean.  The washrooms are on the lower floor.  There is an accessibility washroom on the ground floor.  It is considerate for them to have one."}
{"text":"I usually come here on Tuesdays for their wing deal. The wings are good and I have tried all their sauces and would recommend the hot or suicide sauce with blue cheese on the side. This makes a great pairing. However was very disappointed in the draft beer. I had it on many occasions and it was always very slightly above room temperature. I want a cold beer with my wings! Definitely order a bottled or can beer it's much colder and more enjoyable with your wings! Oh yeah and they have dart boards which is always fun after a nice meal!"}
{"text":"We've been there a few times. If you are \"Old School Canadian\" you'll love this place. Small town vibes and hearty Anglo standard dishes. My son loves the Mac and Cheese. The portions were great as were the prices. The only thing that really bothers me is that wait time for a meal isn't great and the booths and tables aren't as clean as they should be, menus and things left on the table too (ketchup, s&p) It all needs a good scrub, not just a quick wipe after a customer leaves."}
{"text":"Popped in at 11:30pm.  Found out that they don't even serve half of the items on the menu.   Only the late night menu.  Was looking for fish & chips and apparently they couldn't serve it because their kitchen was closed.   Tell me one thing, how is this place still in business?!"}
