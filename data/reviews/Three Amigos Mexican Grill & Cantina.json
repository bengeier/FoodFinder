{"text":"This place never disappoints. The nachos I got were ginormous! And so much meat and toppings, it was outstanding. I've gotten several different dishes here, and the portion sizes are always generous and the quality is top notch."}
{"text":"Awesome! So glad they opened up over here. Good and service are very good. Attentive but not pesky servers. We're going back! Welcome to the hood"}
{"text":"Day one fan of Three Amigos, so congrats on their new location!   Poprock Tonya & I checked on the new digs last night & we had a blast.  While the space is small, much like the Central location, the staff are just as friendly & efficient.   I had ground beef tacos (that cilantro & onion - owwww!) & a small margarita. The chips & salsa were on point, like always!   Parking is decent & prices are affordable."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican. Good flavor and large portions. The location leaves something to be desired, but the food was good at a great price (used a yelp deal)"}
{"text":"I'm so sad to say I pulled in this evening for delicious Mexican food only to find out that this location has closed  not sure why but be sure to check out their other location off of Central Ave. it is just FANTASTIC with excellent service!"}
{"text":"Amazing, just like the other locations. Incredible quesadillas. Delicious drinks, great service."}
{"text":"And with that, another Three Amigos - perhaps the last, if you believe Dalton - is now open, this one in Noda.  It is almost impossible to capture the essence of something and recreate it elsewhere. Nothing else can ever equate to that hole-in-the-wall charm, or make you feel the way when you first had your meal there. This location is also different from the much more sanitized version in Highland Creek.  Instead we have a converted Arby's (you can tell by the sign that remains on the door, inviting you to return on your next visit), but what is inside is like an improved version of the Central Avenue location - larger and still intimate. A most excellent bar and even a private room for parties that need it, without the suburban feel of Highland Creek. Nicely done.  The food is like that of the Central Avenue location, with only a couple noticeable differences - a monstrous bottle of Mexican Coke (presumably because you can find them everywhere, 3A needs to stay a step ahead by offering the larger size) and the same great chips seem to be just a tad thinner than they normally are, breaking more easily.  Other than that, if you know Three Amigos, you'll be comfortable here with some of the best Mexican food in Charlotte. Even the menus are the same, and all-you-can eat enchiladas are on Thursday. Hurry in to get your name on the wall before the target is out of reach.  What's more, the staff is as friendly as ever - perhaps even more so - making it well worth a visit."}
{"text":"I've been to the Central location of Three Amigos many times.  The new location on North Tryon did not disappoint.  My girlfriend likes their margaritas, as she puts it \"they don't have a lot of BS in them\".    Chips and salsa are always fresh.  I had a tostada and enchilada this time out, both great.  The marinated pork is excellent.  We also ordered the mix of enchilada's.  I still think my favorite dish is just the pork tacos with a little lime.    Congrats on the new location, we'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"At the recommendation of another Yelper, I decided to check out this newest location of Three Amigos.  For anyone looking for it, It is directly across the street from the Historic Rosedale Plantation.  I don't remember what was in this space immediately before but judging by the sign as I exited the door it used to be an Arby's at some point.   This is a much larger space than the original location. They have a small bar and plenty of seating. it was sad that I was the only customer there during my visit except for someone picking up something to go.  The menu is the same as the other locations. My problem lately with most Mexican places in this town is that the vegetarian options are very limited. So I opted to eat meat this occasion and went with the enchiladas rojas.  While I was waiting, I was enjoying a good craft milk stout from Left Hand brewery and my complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were good and the regular salsa was flavorful but mild. I asked my server for the hot green salsa that always packs a nice flavorful punch and I was not disappointed.  The roja sauce on the enchiladas was wonderful - so flavorful and spicy!  The chicken was tough and chewy like it was sitting around for a while so I was a bit disappointed. It also came with a nice salad on top as well as the usual beans and rice.  Nothing to write home about with either of those...just typical of what you would find in a Mexican place.  So I am not quite as impressed with my first visit here as some of my Yelp friends but the service was good - Being the only customer, I guess it had to be.  But I enjoy what Three Amigos does and I will probably return sometime in the future."}
