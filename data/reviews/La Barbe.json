{"text":"Found my favorite place,La Barbe, the food taste like home. I had a pork tenderloin,potato salad,cauliflower for $8.00. It was so good went back,l had breaded porkchops with homemade mashed potatoes,veggie. My husband had stuffed cabbage with mashed potatoes. Tonight l had ham barbecue, fries,n,slaw. My husband had a roast beef hoagie n homemade macaroni salad. These meals were $8.50 each and out of this world. Call for the hours but don't  pass it up,not many places make their own side dishes ! Best food ever!!"}
{"text":"Love this place however Linda the bartender is very rude and needs some customer service training for sure. Thankfully Mary Anne is really a sweetheart! I believe she is there sat-mon and she is the only reason I will be coming back to La Barbe's to enjoy their food and drinks."}
{"text":"Cozy, comfortable and inviting.  I don't frequent this place as much as I would like, but when I do, I leave feeling all warm and fuzzy!    What a sweetheart of an owner!  The woman is in her 80's but has more spunk and energy than someone half her age.  Very endearing and so gracious to see her patrons enjoying themselves.  La Barbe  menu is basic restaurant fare, but their daily specials and features are not to be overlooked. Their homemade soups and dinners will remind you of having a meal at grandmas house. Wholesome, hearty, satisfying, and served with love!  If you are unable to visit your grandma, you owe La Barbe a visit!  Cash only."}
