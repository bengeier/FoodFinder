{"text":"the food is tasty, but the restaurant was so dirty. I got free ice tea with my lunch combo, but couldn't get myself to drink it after I saw the container it was in."}
{"text":"The people working here are nice, and the food is great. I have only ever gotten takeout from here, and my favorite is the Honey Chicken. It's the closest place I have been able to find that serves it. The prices are good for the amount of food they give you."}
{"text":"In town from Connecticut. Stopped by for a quick meal. The food and service was excellent.  Loved the General Tso's Chicken very tasty."}
{"text":"Hard to find really good Chinese take out these days. This place does it right. General Tso chicken had rich thick sauce, not the flavored water that seems to be \"normal\" these days. 

Egg rolls were awesome. 

Highly recommended from someone who's a bit snobby about their Chinese take-out! 

(They could use a new ice machine, but I got a Coke in a can, so no worries there)"}
{"text":"I order the orange chicken, 10 crab Rangoon and sweet and sour chicken. The orange chicken is delicious. I haven't tried the sweet and sour chicken yet but the crab Rangoon are absolutely a disappointment. I dont know what happened but on like 3 of them had any filling. I dont know where the filling went and its unacceptable, especially after leaving a generous tip. Ill upload a picture of the atrocities."}
{"text":"I like them. Have tried a bunch of different ones. These are the best I've found of about 6 other places in the area."}
{"text":"Service is kinda slow but food is amazing
Simply amazing I ate all my food in one sitting its hard to finish Chinese food on one sitting but it was soooo delicious. You can get a very reasonable price on everything. The eggrolls are to die for."}
{"text":"Good food, great value, friendly staff, fast.  I've been here many times.  I wish they offered brown rice."}
{"text":"This restaurant always provides a great experience. We always get takeout because the dining room is pretty small, but we prefer takeout anyway. The sesame chicken is a classic, and they do it well. Their egg rolls are always crunchy on the outside and great in the middle. Their prices are extremely affordable and they are always really quick when it comes to making orders. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"It's a Chinese take-out.. What do you want? If you want the best Asian take-out, hit up Asian Garden in Cramerton. Don't want to drive? Then this will do for the General Tso's Chicken midnight craving you've got. When last checked, the health score was a 92. I'm relatively certain that isn't because they serve cat. The ice machine looks questionable. I didn't realize mold could grow in sub-zero temperatures. Actually it was the exposed portions that look questionable. Best bet, take your food and eat at home where (hopefully) your place is a bit cleaner. Your stomach will thank you for feeding its fix for fried rice and an egg roll."}
{"text":"Great take out food.  Enjoyed the friendly service.  The chicken wings were large and delicious."}
