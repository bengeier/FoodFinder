{"text":"Paradise is good. Wildflower is better. But there is no Wildflower in Surprise, so Paradise it is! 

As others have said, the tomato soup is quite delicious. I'm also a big fan of the salad with cranberries....but the name escapes me right now. The turkey wrap is average...lacking flavor. The breakfast quiche is also average. I think mine had been sitting out for a while, so maybe a fresh one would taste better? Cookies are good, but it is hard to screw up cookies. 

The salads are gigantic. Seriously, who needs a salad that big? I guess if you want it for lunch, dinner, and lunch the next day, what a deal! 

It can be a bit confusing the first time you are there since there are two lines, but you figure out that one is for the bakery, one is for the rest of the food, cafeteria style.

Why do I like Wildflower better? I think their sandwiches are better, and the soup as well. The only soup I like at Paradise is the tomato soup. The others are lacking. I need flavor! I like the ambiance at Wildflower better too, although there is much more seating at the Surprise Paradise vs the Goodyear Wildflower. 

Overall, not a bad place to get a fresh salad for lunch."}
{"text":"This Paradise Bakery deserves better than one one star review. A recent visit here late one afternoon, but before the dinner hour rewarded us with our favorite fire roasted tomato soup. Indeed, I like it so much it's hard for me to order anything else, especially paired with a grilled cheese sandwich. Nothing better! This time I tried the asiago steak sandwich, which was good but a bit dry. The soups and salads look wonderful, and the turkey chili and Greek salad are other favorites.
The wait staff were helpful and not unfriendly, but I did notice a bit of laxness at the checkout. Nobody there and customers with trays wondering what to do. I also observed people coming in not seeming to know what to do. There is a large \"Pay Here\" sign over the register, but no sign saying, \"Order Here\". 
Of course we'll be back. It's a welcome stop after shopping, A more prominent hostess to greet newcomers would be helpful."}
{"text":"As is the norn, the food  was super. However, the manager, who was taking our order, was rude. He kept talking to another  employee  while taking our order. Yep, he got it wrong, and as we wanted to order more items, they continued  their conversation. We just gave up on them."}
{"text":"The food here was fast and delicious but the manager horrible. I was completely ignored when trying to order and when asking about the menu wasn't bad enough, the lady(Norma) who was taking my order was actually the manager. No eye contact, no smile, and just plan rude."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped by for a late lunch yesterday. The menu and the food were the same as other Paradise locations. This location wasn't nearly as busy as the others which provided a nice and quiet meal for my mom and I. The onlt downfall was that I have experienced friendlier staff at the other locations. But overall, it was a decent dining experience. 

The thing I love about Paradise is their consistency. The food always tastes the same each and every time. And I have yet to find anything I don't like."}
{"text":"Second time here. First time it was clean and very good food. This time...meh.
The place looked like they needed a few more employees cleaning up. the tables and floors were dirty. Perhaps it was because we came after the lunch rush? Got the Noodle bowl and a half sandwich. Portions are good and the meal comes with a chocolate chip cookie. I wish they had told me that as I ended up buying cookies! I hadn't been here in a few years and forgot. The cashier should tell you this. The sandwich was just ok. As I write this I cant even remember which one I had! That is how unmemorable it was. The Noodle bowl was very good and I took it to go. 
If you are looking for a fast meal this is ok. Get the cookies though! They are the best part of the visit!"}
{"text":"Super nice staff.
I love the Thai Chicken Salad, and Tomato Soup.
I go there 3 times a week mainly because the food never disapoints."}
{"text":"Was not happy with this location/most of the employees that I dealt with the past few experiences I've had here. I work in the area and on occasion stop by on my break for my dinner. I order my food to go always. I don't like how the new set up (order at the front/ pay) and then just wait around for the employees to stop talking with eachother and actually get around to getting to work and having your food ready. I think the old set up gave the employees behind the counter an opportunity to stay busy and give customers  the experience they deserve. The last few times I've been to this location in the evening, I've noticed only a few people actually being productive and the rest of the employees treating their job as a social event where they laugh, talk, and flirt more than anything else. I am still young enough to understand working and having friends, but when someone is being blocked physically from bringing me my food and he tries to walk around the other side of the counter (island) area and the girl runs over to the other side to block him again...All while I'm watching and waiting for my soup. She was treating it like a playground and  he seemed annoyed that she wouldn't give him space to do his job and he saw that I was waiting.  I saw a group of probably 5 people standing around in a circle chatting by where they make sandwiches, while only one/two employees was making food and one/two was at the register and there was a line of people waiting to order. There was also 2 employees standing by the drinking fountain.  I tried getting the tea I like and it was empty so I went to another type instead.  One of the two of them, then walked over and started looking in the tea containers, but didn't say anything to me or offer to go get more of the type I wanted. I honestly love the food (especially the soup), but  will try to go to other places instead just because of the immaturity of the employees, the lack of management presence (unless they were there and allowed that), and the overall lack in customer service in general. This makes me sad because it used to be one of my favorite places to go. The specific incidents from my latest experience was on Tuesday, October 14th in the evening."}
{"text":"I find this Paradise Bakery to be very clean and inviting.  It is a very comfortable place to sit back and visit with friends.  It's also a good place to come if your internet at home is down because they offer free wi-fi.

The cookies are divine.  I tried the chocolate chip and peanut butter, and while these can tend to be pretty plain choices, these cookies were anything but plain - they were moist and chewy!  I went on a Monday and they were buy 1, get 1 free.  Don't know if it was a special or what, but I was happy to get 2 cookies and a soda for about $3.

I need to come back and try some of their soups, salads, and sandwiches and update later.  If their cookies are representative of the rest of their food, I'm sure I'll enjoy it very much."}
{"text":"South west chicken !!! Lol i love the south west chicken salad, half, with the other half being a variety of sandwiches. Its always well kept, clean, neat so i appreciate that. Ihad no tried this one before so i was a little skeptical but there was no need! Lol"}
{"text":"Cookies are great. They always mess up our order. Too expensive."}
{"text":"They don't have the chili aka my favorite \"soup\"."}
{"text":"This one is always busy, but what Paradise isn't. I finally succumbed and started one of their rewards cards. Still waiting on the chili/cornbread to come back."}
{"text":"Great menu for me. Healthy choices. Ideal for my restricted food choices. Large portions. Will put this on my Phx stop list. Would have given 4star but server unfriendly."}
{"text":"A little bit louder than i would have liked but they have pretty good tea with free refills and free WiFi that is excellent quality."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. My lunch break is at 8am in the morning and they always let me make a greek salad early in the morning. Food is always fresh and service is awesome!"}
{"text":"This location has gotten worse over time. This last visit my husband got the classic grilled cheese (which took forever to get) and it was literally a piece of (I think) american cheese in between 2 slices of bread. It had the consistency of processed cheese food. The bread was good, but for $6? Really Paradise? This location is also always the slowest. We went in when there was no one in line. My hubby ordered the tomato soup (which is good) and it was cold by the time he got his sandwich. We decided this was the last visit. There are always so many employees working at one time, I don't understand why they are always so slow."}
{"text":"Lots of PBCs all over the valley and the Denver airport and a few other cities we travel.  Paradise still has one of the better and dependable chocolate chip cookie regardless of location.  

The foods can be hit or miss.  A lot of time we get the SW Caesar without chicken and chicken ends up in there and we have to go back and re-ask for no chicken.  The tomato soup is pretty dependable and the breakfast is good.  I like that you get quite a few options for bread, but I wish they had a few more sandwich choices for vegetarians.  I always think a place like this could just add a grilled cheese to the menu, but I have not seen one.  

Usually most of the PBC's and this Chandler one especially have plenty of seating for groups and even have a few nook/coffee style areas with leather comfy chairs.  The cookies are always dependable and the carrot cake is very good.  I would give this a solid 3 as it is quick and they use good ingredients and typically friendly.  There is a slight difference between the full restaurants and the mall or airport versions, so if you have the option, go to the full restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was good, once they got my order right. Mistakes happen I get it! The staff was very helpful once I explained my order was wrong. Well, almost all the staff...seems like the busser was too busy watching videos than to actually bus tables. During our whole time here, there he was standing in a tray return area watching a movie. On. Full. Blast. I forgave the mistakes made by the kitchen, but this completely ruined my experience. I will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"Great food! My order was messed up though and I was over charged. I was very specific about my order too, so it was weird. Make sure you are very specific as to what you want. While I was waiting I saw two other people cone back with messed up orders. They need to get their act together."}
{"text":"The Paradise Bakery off Ray & I-10 is always courteous and consistent. I enjoy being able to have sometime to work in the morning in a great environment without the MUSIC BLARING like it does at other Paradise Bakery locations!"}
{"text":"We enjoy the salads and panini selections. Love their chocolate chip cookies- so chewy!!!"}
{"text":"Great for breakfast, ok for lunch, dinner leaves a bit to be desired with so many sandwich shops in Surprise. Menu seems to be semiseasonal so while they have regulars you might miss out or discover a new favorite. To be blunt, every less than good experience has been that Surprise staple, the \"holy cow how did you drive here you mummies\" who think they are the only people here, are usually rude, and may try to run you over in the parking lot or the snowbirds which sometimes are the same people. Be warned, coming in here is a gamble that you might have to wait for a seat for the explosion at the Q-Tip factory to fade out or crumble to dust. Try the tomato soup!"}
{"text":"One of several locations in the Phoenix/Surprise/Glendale area, Paradise Bakery offers primarily sandwiches, breads, soups, salads and pastries, all made fresh and daily.

(Scales are 1-5, same as Yelp ratings)

Atmosphere: 5

There is plenty of seating, even during peak hours. This is not a take your date out type of restaurant, but it's not a dump. I describe it as somewhere in between. The area is clean and there is plenty of parking.

Service: 5

You enter the restaurant, fall in line, one of the employees will ask you what you want, you pay at the cash register and you pick up your order. The service is prompt and attentive.

Food: 4

I have only tried their sandwiches, salads, cookies and muffins. All three are above average, especially their cookies. There could be more variety in the soup and salad selections, but they make up for some of that with the sandwich variety and ingredient control. You can buy half sandwich/salad(or soup) combinations and the quality and quantity match and sometimes exceed the price. Plus, you get a cookie with your meal. Which brings me to their favorite item: cookies. I am a cookie fiend and their cookies are exceptional. Soft and chewy, fresh and delicious. Even the cookies they add to the meals are pretty good.  

Their muffins are also top notch. 

Cost: 4.5

Their prices do not change from lunch to dinner, so a meal during lunch may be relatively costly. 

Pros: Well prepared, tasty sandwiches. Good atmosphere and service. Well above average pastries.

Cons: Slightly more costly during lunch. Needs more soup and salad variety.

Best Entrees: Vegetarian sandwich. Cookies!
Worst Entrees: None so far. 

Sample Size: I have eaten here over 3 times in the past 2 years"}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be. BBQ Chicken Salad is just ok. They brought me the wrong sandwich, but it took so long to get it in the first place and the line is so long I don't dare go back up there. Cashier is a little snooty. Don't need to ever come back here again."}
{"text":"This is a great alternative for fast food when you're out and about and feeling famished. They now offer some true vegan options : a miso broth with soba noodles and edamame or quinoa and lentils. I had the soba noodle option and it was delicious - a rich, smoky flavour loaded with edamame, carrots, spinach and red peppers. It was a perfect size for lunch just on its own but for $3 you can add a half sandwich made on Panera bread. I had a veggie sandwich with all the fixings and hummus spread instead of mayo, sans feta. Yum!  I will be coming here again. Thanks for offering us vegans something other than a salad."}
{"text":"Went in at about 30 minutes before they closed with my friend. Most workers already seemed checked out already and not paying much attention. They almost seemed annoyed we were there.

We had a simple order that they seemed very confused about and unsure how to execute. They then told me they were out of the soup i wanted, so i asked for a different one. Then, after waiting for another minute or two, a manager comes out to inform me that they were out of the second soup as well. This wasnt a problem, they just took forever to inform me of an easily solvable problem. Then After being rang up, they had forgotten to give us our breadbowl and an order of mac and cheese. Overall, it was a really unnecessary ordeal."}
{"text":"I normally go to the Paradise Bakery in Scottsdale and have never had any issue with it. But a visit to this Bell Road location was a complete fail. First off, they have implemented their new \"Panera\" ordering system which means I order my food at the register but have zero ability to watch them assemble my food. As a person with severe food intolerances, it has always been a benefit of eating at Paradise Bakery to be able to watch to be sure they aren't putting cheese etc into my food. Second, if I could have seen the bowl of fruit salad they were going to serve me I would have never ordered it. It was disgusting. The pineapple was so old that it was dark yellow and half shredded. The rest of the fruit was saturated with juice and looked and tasted really old. Nasty, couldn't even get my husband to eat it (and he never wastes food!). My husband said his tomato soup was like drinking pasta sauce and it didn't look like I remember it. Our server forgot to bring us forks and then disappeared to allegedly get forks for us and was gone so long that I went inside to get them myself.....only to find that there is not a single piece of silverware (even plastic) anywhere within a customers reach. What is that?! Why do I have to get someone's attention behind the counter to get a stupid fork?!  
All in all the only good thing was the cookie. That's it. Won't return to that location ever again.....and I don't think I'll ever be able to convince my husband to go to any other location. Too bad, it used to  be a healthy option for food."}
{"text":"I had the french onion soup, and it was great. Definitely going to try the bread bowl next time. And the snicker-doodle cookies were glorious!"}
{"text":"Pair of Dice Baked-ery
By The Rue

I usually don't eat breakfast in the morning,
Although I'm hungry and pretty horny,
I decided to stop today and pick something up,
I got some sort of breakfast sandwich, what?
It was loaded with eggs, cheese and peppers,
The workers there didn't treat me like a leper.

When I usually go I'll eat outside,
Lunchtime yoga girls, you cannot hide,
I'll stare at you as you go in and out,
Yes I'm \"that guy\" cat calls I won't shout,
Though it might not look like I'm looking at you,
Trust me I noticed the tramp stamp tattoo.

Needless to say I'm a big fan of Paradise,
Breakfast and lunch, I'll eat here twice,
If you see a creepy guy outside eating alone,
Don't be afraid to get his number or take him home,
I'm really not \"that guy\" if you must know,
I should be in showbiz and produce my own show.

Bing!!!"}
{"text":"CONSISTENTLY bad service. Always very slow and employees often forget to make food; I've had to go up and remind them several times. Just tonight they forgot all the meat and cheese on the woman in front of me's sandwich, and gave me the completely wrong order."}
{"text":"This place blows, mostly because it's owned by Panera Bread.  This place is a Wildflower imitation and a cheap one at that. Oh wait, I mean it's over priced and the portions are pathetically small. The cookies were pretty good, and the salad was decent. The only saving grace was the service, but even that was lacking. Nobody checked back on us and they forgot half our order. Over-priced bland food. Save yourself and go to literally ANYWHERE else in the area."}
{"text":"If you haven't had a chance to get by this location, GO! They do an amazing table service now, and you order right as you enter! No more waiting for people in front of you to slowly progress through the long line!!!"}
{"text":"The best place to eat the best tomato or tortilla soup and a great sandwich or a wrap. I used to go so here often that Tony invented me the Fernando sandwich. I really enjoy going here, their pastries and everything it's just succulent.

All the staff is super friendly and they are a jewel in the desert."}
{"text":"I thought it was about time I did a 2-star review so I picked this place. I used to go to Paradise Bakery all the time (Wi-Fi being the main reason) but the past year or so it's gone way downhill. Worse quality food, bad service, etc. I had the same experience at Panera in California."}
{"text":"Got asked to leave because daughter left her shoes at home and only wears volleyball shoes on the court. I think that's awfully petty."}
{"text":"This location is awful and i enjoy paradise bakery very much. First, this location screws you over on how much you get. Other locations will fill your salad and pack your sandwiches full. Not this place.
Ordered a chicken cobb salad. Got the whole size and they gave us a half size. It came with one hard boiled egg, not cut up or anything it was literally the whole egg, two slivers of avacado and ZERO chicken!
Ordered a Mediterranean sandwich and they made it with the entirely wrong bread which A. Made it taste like crap and B. Made it smaller so again i got screwed on portion size.
Also every location i have been to gives cookies to everyone with their meal. Got no cookies for either meal here.
Service is a joke the kid up front just wanted to talk with his friends.
All i can say is im glad the kneadery across the street is open cause i seriously doubt ill return here"}
{"text":"This place is a joke! Food was disgusting, tables were dirty, and the employees are in incompetent. My order was messed up twice!!! Instead of attempting to fix it the first time, they just made us pay for it again....and still got it wrong the second time around. The ordering system itself is ridiculous!!! Nothing like any Paradise Bakery I've ever been to. This location is a shameful representation of the Brand. Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Most of our experience with Paradise has been carry-out meals. The food is always good, but they rarely get the order right. They usually leave something out, but every once in a while they give you the wrong items. If they can get their orders right, this could jump to four or five stars."}
{"text":"I always go to paradise bakery and today I stopped in at a different location because I was in the area. I usually love the food but today everything I ordered just missed the mark. My Cesar salad had so much brown old lettuce I didn't really want to eat it and the paradise pasta taste really wasn't great. It was as if I were eating plain pasta. The people are nice but I guess I felt super rushed at the register. Before I could even tell the cashier thank you she was calling over the next person, as I'm trying to get my wallet back into my bag & get my food situated the next customer is already right behind me give their order as they're reaching over me. I really do love paradise bakery but this location missed the mark today. I most likely won't be revisiting."}
{"text":"I like Paradise Bakery in general but this location has really terrible management. The staff is always rude and seems annoyed by you being there. Tonight, I came 20 minutes before closing to get a soup to go and had to wait for someone to stop cleaning/packing up to serve me. Then, when I paid and was leaving, one of the staff wouldn't stop sweeping to let me pass, so she literally swept stuff onto me as I walked by. I don't know what's wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Always good and fresh! Lots of free cookies here and there to sample; \"thank you very much don't mind if I do!\""}
{"text":"Had coffee and muffin. Very nice staff. Sat within earshot off an interview taking place. Very impressed with their employee screening process. If you want a job here be ready for a great interview."}
{"text":"This place is going to go out of business. They are understaffed and no longer have fire roasted tomato soup."}
{"text":"Items I have tried recently that were delish:

-Asiago roast beef sandwich, I normally don't like horseradish sauce but it's amazing on this bad boy!

-White cheddar mac & cheese, freakin yum!

-Coconut chocolate chip cookies, better than the regular chocolate chip cookies!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite paradise bakery location. It's always clean and all the employees are kind and helpful :)"}
{"text":"Apparently they have been sold to Panera Bread. Cookies tasteless, sandwiches not as good. I miss Paradise, no one has chicken salad like they do. There are a few still around in good courts."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Paradise baker. This one in San Tan is also fantastic.
They have something for everyone. You can have coffee and cookies or soup or vegetarian sandwiches. Can't beat it. 
If you are in San Tan Village do not go to the food court. Go here instead. Much better food."}
{"text":"Okay I usually don't write yelp reviews but I feel like I need to for this place. I love Paradise Bakery . I used to go to the one in downtown Phoenix until it closed down I decide to try this one out and I was very disappointed. 
I went in to eat at 9 just to beat the crowd. I order the pick 2 items and they came out very slow ! It took them about 20 minutes to bring me my food. I was sitting at the table waiting while the guy across from me said he has been waiting for 20 minutes also. The staff just sat back and talked while we were all waiting. I asked the waiter how  much longer it was going to be and she ignored me.  So I asked the next person and she ingored me as well . when my salad came out it was very dry! I asked for more dressing and they looked at me like I was weird.
I don't recommend anyone  to go to this place in the morning.  I will try again and see if it works out in the afternoon."}
{"text":"First timer 
Many choices to pick from 
Affordable and tasty as well 
Loved the chipotle chicken 

Paradise over your Subway alternative any day 
Give it a shot"}
{"text":"I often used to stop in here for lunch and have not had any problems with the quality of the food. However- the employees frequently mix up orders and have the audacity to sneer at you and act rude to you when this happens.  This place is too expensive to be treated like a nuisance when you walk through the doors. Like other reviewers have mentioned before, the employees like to huddle in the back and gossip while they ignore you- putting you in a very awkward position where you have to ask to be acknowledged.  After they begrudgingly serve you they give you attitude the entire time.  I thought that this was just an off-day, but every time I came back- I received similar treatment. Needless to say, I do not spend my money here anymore."}
{"text":"This is my second time in Chandler for work, and I've been here about four times.  I've basically come here every day during my visits.  It's a great place to have a casual meal and get some more work done.  I like the food and the friendly service, and also refuse to pay for the wireless in my hotel room (even though my employer would reimburse me for it).  Plus, I like the relaxed, community-esque feel of this place.

As for the food, I'd recommend the Tuscan Chicken sandwich - the Ciabatta bread it comes on is really quite delicious, but make sure it's fresh.  salads are simple, but pretty good, and everything tastes fresh.  The chocolate chip cookies are to-die-for.  

The people who work here are very friendly.  One guy was particularly helpful and helped me as I contemplated for about five minutes what I should get.  He then came to check how my food was, even though this is a self-service type of place.  

I would not recommend the half-sandwich half-salad combo if you're really hungry.  Somehow a whole sandwich seemed more filling to me.

Even though I avoid chain restaurants, I really like this one!  Maybe it's because we don't have one in Northern California, so it still makes me feel like this is \"something different\"."}
{"text":"Love this place. Mmmm cookies have that fabulous home made taste. This is my fast food choice. If only they had the value menu. Lol. The staff is always friendly and the food is fresh and quick. I love that you can order coffee and meet there for business. I do my interviews there."}
{"text":"The food was very good. I had the Asian Sesame Chicken 'combination two' with a bowl of black bean soup. The quality was outstanding, the black bean soup was just served. No crackers, a dash of cheese, no anything to give that added panache without significant additional expense. 
It is 6:55pm on Saturday and it is not busy,  but many tables are dirty with trays and crumbs left on them. The floors are scattered with crumbs as well. If they are allowing the restaurant floor to be dirty is kitchen in the back dirty too?"}
{"text":"Incredibly crappy service from management!! Female mngr and male mngr very rude when getting a complain that I have everytime I go there ! I no longer will be going here I will not be treated badly after spending a lot lot of money here! I highly suggest kneaders !!! When a customer complains and has came to you as a mngr several times and she just looks at you like Dah and smiles it's rude! Your not doing the best lady you reAlly really need to learn some mngr skills and customer service skills ! So do you sir!! You about to loose Lot of customers over this. Your store is dirty all the time the lemons look so bad I would not let my kid get one. Gross!!! And gross service!'! No thank you!"}
{"text":"I've never been here before, but when I walked in I was very confused on how to order. No one directly helped us and I was puzzled on the whole process. After obtaining my food Chicken tortellini Alfredo, I was shocked. This \"chicken\" was nothing of the pollo family.. But instead a PIG! THERE WAS HAM IN MY TORTELLINI. After being disgusted and ranting to my friends, I proceeded to write this review about how bad my first experience or paradise bakery was. Amen."}
{"text":"Arrive at 10:35 and try to order a breakfast sandwich.  Order taker says no can do because we stopped serving breakfast at 10:30.  You turned away a customer because of this?"}
{"text":"First timer here.  Poorly organized ordering, drink area was a mess, food was nominal.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Paradise makes great food- I can't argue that. I absolutlely LOVE the Asian Chicken Salad. It is delicious! I will usually pair that with a half turkey or half chicken salad sandwhich. Can't go wrong! But I just can't give them more than three stars because of the prices. They are pretty high considering half of my $13 meal is lettuce and bread. I do love going here once in a while as a treat, but it is not somewhere I care to go on a regular basis."}
{"text":"My favorites were the chicken kabobs and gyro plate. Also the gyro sandwich was amazing. Also the pita and hummus were so good!!"}
{"text":"They changed how you order food. Now instead of going through the line as they make it, you order and go sit and wait for it. I wouldn't have an issue with this but why change what isn't broken? When they brought me my salad it seemed as though they just threw the ingredients into the bowl without mixing anything. My boyfriend's steak sandwich was mostly spinach. I liked how it was before when you could actually watch what was going on. Sigh."}
{"text":"Horrible experience and will NOT return. Totally disorganized. Most of the empty tables were unbussed. Three lines merged into one and orders were not taken correctly. Workers were standing around with dazed looks and unwilling to help - they simply pointed to a different person when asked for assistance."}
{"text":"No pride in ownership at this location.  Don't get me wrong, I know that the staff are probably all wage earners, but management needs serious corrective discipline.  Unfinished food was left on an adjacent table for the entire duration of my meal.  The cookie was solid as concrete.  If you want repeat business, throw away the old cookies instead of serving them to your next victim.  The sandwich was seriously unbalanced.  A quality sandwich will have consistency in each bite.  i.e. one bite had no pastrami while another bite has almost all pastrami with no salami.  When you put three slices of onion on a sandwich, separate them instead of tossing on three concentric rings.  It takes a serious, \"I don't give a sh*t attitude\" to serve food this bad.  This place is absolute garbage."}
{"text":"This place used to have great food now it's just fair.  It takes too long to order and the staff is rude.  Employees look like they hate being there.  Starting to look dirty and always out of cups or napkins.  This used to be my favorite place so I hope they read their reviews and turn the place around!"}
{"text":"I love paradise bakery. This location is always clean with friendly staff. I like getting the black bean soup and a half cuban sandwich. Good bread and good coffee if you're there for breakfast."}
{"text":"I visited Paradise Bakery On Feb 26th, located in Surprise AZ. While on line waiting to pay for my order, I witnessed an employee, with a dirty pink rag in her hand, cleaning all around the top of the salad bar. She wiped the top of the bar, and then proceeded to push the salad that was left on top, (after salads were prepared), back into the rest of the salad, with that dirty pink rag!! It was disgusting to watch. She did not care, that she did it right in front of customers.  I brought it to the attention of the cashier, and she said she would talk to her, but the whole while I ate my order, (after what I saw, begrudgingly) I noticed no one said a word to her, and she continued with that disgusting pink rag all over the counter, where the salad was being prepared for others, and also used it to clean other parts of the areas preparing food.  I don't think this business will make the Dean's list. If I saw that right out in the open, who knows what goes on behind the scenes.  I emailed my complaint about this on their website, but only received a reply, that it would be brought to the attention of the  Management of that business. I've heard nothing back.  I have not been able to go back into this eatery since."}
{"text":"I've never been so disappointed as I have been today picking up my lunch at this Paradise bakery location. I called in my order waited 20 minutes as they had asked.  When inside they made me wait at the end of a very long line to get my order. I could tell that my sandwiches had already been made. I took a look at that sandwiches and some of them were soggy, messy, and lacked the ingredients that were so accustomed to getting. Doubt if I'll ever come back to this location again."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast. Menu extremely limited and wound up with muffins and bagels. Both were fresh with good taste but overpriced. Notice that bagels have different prices based on the type you choose. An Asiago bagel is 40 cents more than a sesame bagel! Cost of cream cheese is ridiculous.  Service was prompt and place was clean."}
{"text":"Since the \"merge\" I do not like this....bad food, lots of mixed up orders....won't go back."}
{"text":"Did not have a good experience at this location.  Little Asian boy attempted to take order, had no idea what he was doing.  Later, they had him cleaning off tables.  Place was disorganized, big line back up.

Ordered a new Thai Flat bread.  That was horrible.  Mostly shredded cabbage and sauce on a flat bread.  It was gross.

Too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"We started coming here since the Dana Park one converted to Panera.  I come here because I can order the sandwiches and pasta salad early in the morning.  I love the frontega chicken panini and paradise pasta. Please don't convert to Panera! They don't give you the delicious free cookie with your meal and they don't serve the paradise pasta salad.  The one thing I would change is the coffee.  For some reason I don't like their coffee here but that's just me being picky."}
{"text":"I love love love paradise bakery. I usually go to the one on bell, which is so much better than this location. The food is never bad, but the staff is just a mess. 
They are almost always out of forks, its so weird.
The number one reason I don't like this location is because of their organization. They rush you at each station and if you even begin to talk about a salad in the soup section they just look at you like you're stupid. 
I love paradise and its much more worth it to drive to the one on bell."}
{"text":"Over priced bakery. They always seem to run out of stuff in the early afternoon. I noticed three times I asked for a bread bowl and there are out of them. Lame. Bakery ? More like a cafeteria that doesn't have anything and over priced. Will now go to Kneaders down the street."}
{"text":"The food is really nice but its a bit over priced...service is really good..they have great personalitites..."}
{"text":"Food was terrific. Waitress was having a bad day or she might have just gotten the new Samsung note II because she did not remember it was a family friends birthday which I told her in the beginning and after the meal...  That aside,  great place to eat!  

Food 8/10
Service 5/10
Experience 5/10


-Cheers-."}
{"text":"This is a great location, staff is friendly and helpful. The service was fast and the food was great and was consistent with other locations I've been to."}
{"text":"I watched an employee refill the utensils, a fork fell on the floor & he picked it up and placed it back in the bin. Yikes. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop for some cookies tonight and for some other sweets. The selections were really low and cookies looked as if they had been out all day.  I got a dozen and was disappointed they were a bit over cooked or just sat out all day."}
{"text":"Pardise has recently become one of my go-to places, I've tried many things on the menu and they were all amazing.  Their ingredients are always fresh and their menu has more than enough options to satisfy the needy."}
{"text":"Service was very slow, I had to repeat my takeout order several times.  When I got home, I was missing a third of it, but it was on my receipt.  I called, waded through all the recorded choices, pressed 5 for a manager, got a recording saying they were too busy to talk with me if it was mealtime, but I was calling after their \"busy\" hours, so I stuck with it. It rang for a long time, then hung up on me. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Very disorganized. Stopped in a breakfast and coffee. Food was good but staff does not seem ready for customers. Coffee was empty, and then quickly emptied again. Staff seemed surprised by this. Why?  It is morning after all! Tables not cleaned off. Patrons are moving dishes to sit at a table. This location is now a Panera and just not to the level I expected from Panera or Paradise Bakery."}
{"text":"I went there today because the last experience(also my first) with Paradise by my house was absolutely delightful and everything was great however, this time my sandwich was so drenched in sauce it was mushy (which it only took me 2 minutes to get it home) and my soup was awful. Along with my boyfriend who had the chicken tortellini.. He took a couple of bites and pushed it to the side. I took a bite and let me just tell you the only word that came into my head was \"disgusting\". I will NOT be going to this location again.
The only good thing they had were the rolls, so if you're only eating bread rolls maybe stop in here. Otherwise, Definitely not worth the stop. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I want to give a better review, but unfortunately today's experience was too poor to overlook.

Bad experience today... Low inventory, really slow service, their signature breakfast item is the muffins. While I was standing in line they ran out of almost everything and apparently weren't prepared with any new muffins baking. 

I walked out instead of getting breakfast"}
{"text":"I must say when I was first invited to go here I was dreading it as I thought we were dining in a regular bakery.  I am not able to eat that type of food with diabetes but I was with a large group and didn't want to be the wet blanket so figured I'd get a little something and a drink and move fake it.  What a surprise I had coming. Such a nice clean and friendly place  with a friendly staff. The line was lunchtime long but moved very quickly.  I get nervous having people wait for me to decide so I saw a fresh salad list and (didn't have my glasses on) saw a chicken salad so would order that. As we waited to order a fine looking young man was asking who in line would be ordering a sandwich and looked like he would start their order so it would be ready. My friend I was next to in line started giving me the 411 and BOY there is a lot to chose from including delicious soups!  She ordered the Cobb Salad and ...well I changed my order PRONTO! You can chose small or large size and they are both nice sizes. She requested extra blue cheese while they were building her order and they were more then happy to oblige.  When I told them I would have the same thing they first asked if I also wanted extra cheese or any special additions or whatever. That is something you don't get or expect much anymore. I was able to customize my with no attitude..YAY!  Since our order was easy to be made we didn't need a # for our table and the cashier was very pleasant and welcomed me on my first visit. Our large group took up the outside patio and the staff was always aware of our drink needs and removing any dishes.  My meal was fantastic and the wonderful bread,soup and sandwiches everyone else had looked amazing. I can't wait to return...probably next week.  The prices are great for food that is by far fresher then food I get in pricier restaurants.  I also hears lots of \"Umms\" and Yummmy\" from those around me with delicious desserts.  So if you are like me and didn't know, it's not a little bakery but a wonderful Cafe type eatery.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Paradise Bakery location for several months and I've always been very pleased.  The service is good and employees are friendly, and best of all they're pretty efficient when it comes to serving my food quickly and accurately.

The menu appears to be the same as all other Paradise locations in the area (except for the soup types, changes depending on the day).  I've always found the quality of the food to be consistent and prices reasonable compared to similar types of eateries.  The salads and sandwiches are pretty good, but the soups are awesome (and I'm not a soup person)!

The best part about this place is that I've been able to sit here for hours, literally, doing work on my laptop.  Nobody ever asked me to leave and I feel safe leaving my computer on the table to grab a free refill of my soda or go to the bathroom.  The booth seats are comfortable enough to sit on for hours, and they do have some areas with outlets for power.  This location is also MUCH quieter and less hectic than all other paradise locations I've been to."}
{"text":"Really unpleasant overall experience here.
On arrival, the fellow who greeted us to take our order was super friendly.  We went to the salad area and picked our our salad and then went to the cash register.  There was one lady in line ahead of us and after she paid, the cashier just walked away and went thru a door into the back.  We waited about 4 minutes, she didn't return and noone working in the prep area noticed that we were still there...so we went to sit down and eat our salad.
The sandwiches were delivered and they were fine, not great, just fine.
The busser running around cleaning was doing a great job and was super friendly.  
Finally, after finishing our lunch, I went back up to the cash register to pay for our meal.  The same cashier, came over with her purse slung over her shoulder.  She curtly asked what I wanted and I told her that I wanted to pay for the meal we had already eaten.  She plopped her purse down on the counter right down on the food service area, on top of a plastic covered tray of baked goods, no less.  I mentioned that putting her purse on the food and service area was really gross so she picked it up and put it down on the floor.  She really was quite stunningly rude and completely unapologetic about ignoring us the first time that I tried to pay.  
I asked, and she said her name was \"Vicky\".  

I'd say, lose the rude, unhygienic employee \"Vicky\" who is not the slightest bit interested in good customer service and this place would gain a star, maybe two.  Perhaps she's related to the manager?"}
{"text":"There nothing worst then getting a salad that has been drowned in dressing. Just about 30 mins ago I popped in and got a Mediterranean Salad to-go. They were cleaning up so I was not able to watch them make my salad. Well, needless to say the dressing was not on the side. My salad in drowning in it's dressing. I don't live close to them so I can not take it back to have them make it right. They need to put a rule in place that all to-go salads have the dressing on the side. I'm trying to wash the dressing off and it's not working. :("}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly people. Except, for some reason the lady checking us out. Supposed to be the same company as Panera Bread, and while it is pretty much the same menu, Panera has just a little more finesse and I MISS THE BAGUETTES!!! :("}
{"text":"The new way to order sucks and is stupid. You have 6 people behind the counter just standing around talking waiting for orders. If the set up was like it was everyone would be busy. Not pleased and not coming back!!!"}
{"text":"the food is great but CORALYNN was a mess, she said she was ready to take my order so I told her and then she took two minutes to do something and then asked me two more times for my order? She didn't know what came with my meal either and her name tag said she was an associate TRAINER."}
{"text":"Almost every time I've been here they get my order wrong.  Tonight was the last time I will go.  They put a hot sandwich wrapped in paper in the bag.  Sauce and cheese resulted in a really soggy dinner.  I paid for a full sized sandwich, but received significantly less.  I took photos and will try to post them here.  I went up to the counter to ask them about it and they literally just stood there staring at me until I walked away."}
{"text":"I come here for the cookies and muffins PERIOD. Super flavorful...lemon cookie and the coconut chocolate chip are my favorites. As for their salads and sandwiches...not bad tasting but definitely not worth the price. $6 for a half salad with a couple slices of chicken. I'd rather go to Which Wich for a sandwich or lettuce wrap!"}
{"text":"The employees act like they are really busy doing something else, and I am interrupting them to give them my order. They are rarely friendly. On one visit, they were training several new people and were grouchy with them, which was very unprofessional, within earshot of a customer. So many of their employees are in a bad mood, I would have to guess it's not a good company to work for.

I like most of the food, although I would agree it is a little overpriced."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of paradise bakeries. This one was near my parents house and seemed like a convenient place for lunch. Compared to most Paradise bakery is this what is subpar. In general it seems Paradise bakery has been going down a little bit the last couple years. I heard it's because another company to come over but I'm not sure about that. What I am sure of is that even Adam early lunch they were out of a lot of stuff and the service was poor."}
{"text":"I am a recent PB convert.  I can't say for sure why I never gave it a shot until a couple months ago, but I'm glad I changed my tune!  

I like stopping in here for a quick, healthy meal.  It's not as cheap as fast food, but it comes without the guilt.  I'm a fan of the 1/2 salad, 1/2 soup combo; any variety you choose can't go wrong.  The french onion soup is full of bite-sized pieces of onion, so you don't get that long, onion-like noodle issue!  

I still haven't quite worked out their system... it seems like different employees have different stations, so you order your salad and soup from different people.  But sometimes one person sticks with you clear to the end.  Either way is fine, I'd just like them to be clear about what they need me to do.

This location is pretty large, with ample parking, an indoor dining room, and a spacious patio.  The night shift folks on our last visit were really energetic and friendly, easily welcoming us in to their silliness.  There's another PB closer to home so I'll likely stick with that one overall, but this is a great option for the Ahwatukee area!"}
{"text":"I went in and bought breakfast, iced coffee, and two walnut chocolate chip cookies and when I ate one of the cookies I but I to something and almost broke my tooth. They said it was a walnut shell and they took my information down and I haven't heard from the company. They didn't even do anything. They said \"oh we're so sorry\" and that was pretty much it. I usually love their cookies but I'll never eat one again because I'm worried that I'll bite into something again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday afternoon and ordered the turkey & avacado sandwich, 1/2 a turkey sandwich, which was ok I could have made the sandwich at home, it was turkey, lettuce and tomatoes had chicken & wild rice soup ( soup was good) and cookies (cookies were good) I guess I am used to The Wildflower Bread Company.  
Overall food ok, prices are like dinner prices at a restaurant and customer service good. 

Had my order to go, really not a spot to wait for to go orders, waited awhile and they yell out your name, if they have it right."}
{"text":"always fresh, always a home run with whatever sandwich I get (do I even need to mention the cookies).. And a trip with the toddler revealed some AMAZING kids mac a cheese that I now must get even when theres no kids with me, although I am the biggest kid of all."}
{"text":"I had visited this location over the years however, upon visiting on a week day afternoon, I noticed that the cafe was a bit behind on their; clean up due to further noticing that a variety of their tables were not attended after customers had left. Their service was fair however they had always been \"tip top\" in attending you quickly and efficiently. Their food quality remains to be outstanding as usual. The cafe may have had a short hand of personnel on the day that I had recently visited yet I believe that they have the potential in providing improved customer service for future days."}
{"text":"Not so great experience at Paradise.  Waited in line with my two children to get something. By time it was our turn, woman smiled and said hello. Another woman in a blue shirt (assumed she was a manager as it appeared she was training this other person) turned to me in a rude manner and stated she would be right with us. It was obviously so vital and critical to leave me waiting and to be treated so rudely. She then proceeds to explain to this other employee about these products down below the counter. Over 7 minutes with now both of their backs to us and taking their time discussing/explaining this so critical information that was more important than a customer. I told my children that we were leaving since the service seemed to be terrible. Nobody addressed me as I was leaving and we walked out. Very disappointed in this experience."}
{"text":"Great place for a healthy breakfast or lunch! Grab to go or dine in. Friendly staff and great food, you can ask for anything better then that! Try the new power chicken hummus bowl, it's a new twist on how to eat hummus and so tasty! If your more of a sandwich kinda person try the new steak and white cheddar panini...it will melt in your mouth and put a smile on your face! Cheers"}
{"text":"Been going there for few times now...... the last three weeks it has been Blah ! Muffins are to dry ,I bought Blueberry , Mandarin and Cinnamon walnut Muffin and all of them so dry they crumble . Ask for a hot latte and the machine is broken I mean both machines .. so the third try they come up with we do only cold latte ... and it clearly say's now serving Hot latte's ...yeah right. Most of the food looks like I can make it at home and kinda pricey for easy food you can make....  Im out not going back, no more Paradise for me, going down hill guys.... Oh by the way , I went to STARBUCKS for a Hot Latte, why did I even bother to ask in Paradise ...  See ya !"}
{"text":"The food at any Paradise Bakery is great. Occasionally at this location the employees will ignore you for a little bit while you're waiting at the counter. The other day, however, I left my debit card at their location and when I called they had it. The person who was cleaning the tables must have put the card aside and kept it for me. I was very pleased with the honesty!"}
{"text":"What I love about this location is their soup selection...they have all of them, every day. Broccoli cheddar is excellent. As is the fire-roasted tomato. That's all I ever get because everything else is rather over-priced."}
{"text":"If you are under 50 years old, you don't golf, and you happen to find yourself in Sun City Grand, treat yourself to a cookie from here. Or 12. Really their cookies are amazing, and you won't have much else to do than eat them, anyway. Check the coconut chocolate chip and the peanut butter chocolate chip.
They have some okay salads, too, and I like their set up (you can watch them make your side salad and tell them what to put on it). The apple balsamic vinegar dressing is also worth trying."}
{"text":"I'm from New York and we passed this place on the way to our hotel from the airport.  

I'm assuming it is owned by panera bread or this place would have a big lawsuit coming their way.  EXACT same menu.  

The system of ordering is dumb.  I work in a restaurant and let's be honest...it just isn't user friendly.  Thank god we were the only ones in that place bc we all looked like morons walking back from station to station.   If corporate is reading this- CHANGE THE SYSTEM!  People like simplicity.  Especially when you already have a bunch of food and choices to choose from.  

Food was good.  My frontega chicken seemed a bit undercooked but I just some of it out no biggie.  

The cookie they give you is dangerously good."}
{"text":"Well, it's been 20+ years that I've been a regular customer of Paradise Bakery. I've purchased most of their refillable cups/mugs and even have an original very faded one that has the old turquoise and purple colors with the palm tree design/logo. I've loved them from the beginning. What's not to love?! Fresh baked goods (LOVE the ginger molasses cookies, mandarin orange muffins and scones. Their sandwiches, soups and salads made fresh to order have never disappointed. I could go on and on but my Paradise coffee is getting cold and the muffin is calling my name. Always consistent, ALWAYS Paradise! To be continued . . ."}
{"text":"Food is always just fine but at times the service is severely lacking especially as of late."}
{"text":"I really like Paradise Bakery, I was at this location every morning for about 2 years. The staff was always friendly but sometimes the line can get long if a lot of people come in at once. It can be a long wait to get served. Being a big muffin fan I always loved the apple cinnamon and blueberry muffins and they are consistently good.

The Paradise rewards are a nice perk, compared to other coffee shops it is easy to earn free drinks and food if you are a regular and would spend the money anyway.

The only reason this location looses one star is the sometimes pushy home business folk that take over every available booth and camp with their laptops. This is during the week. On weekends you get whole families with screaming kids. This does not seem to happen at the other locations in the area, could be the proximity to the hotel next door."}
{"text":"Love me some Paradise Bakery & those soups are so yummy. I love the tomato. It's the best if you ask me. Just sayin'. The chips cookies definitely don't suck wither. I also like that they have both Diet DP & Diet Dew. Always pleasant staff & consistent yummy's."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. My wife had a salad and all the lettuce was limp. I had a medium bowl of pasta which was fine. Our out of town guest had a sandwich and a salad. Same complaint on the salad. Most frustrating part was finding a cleared off table. The bus boy (  a teen) was walking around twirling his towel in the air while several tables and booths were unattended and with many used dishes and cups. I finally caught up with him and asked him to clear a table so we could sit down and eat our meal. Not a good experience and not good food."}
{"text":"Dear Sharon,

Your Paradise Bakery is by far the friendliest Paradise Bakery. Ever. I'm disappointed it just opened because I will be moving to the other side of town at the end of the month and now I know the best PB is right here. I went to your location tonight and I fell completely in love with your staff -- they are amazing. Everyone smiled, asked how they could help, and even asked if we were having a good night. 

Now I'm going to name names: Christian the greeter was very engaging and couldn't have been more helpful. He checked on us to make sure our dining needs were met. Cassie let my mom sample her soup of choice and was a complete sweetheart. David was sure to go over the menu with us and was very accommodating with our breads of preference and Chase was also extremely courteous. Your entire staff was perfect; do not let them go. 

Everyone was professional, up-beat and obviously happy to be working there, the smiles never ended. And that really makes your restaurant paradise. 

Cheers,

Naomi"}
{"text":"Love Paradise's food but this location has changed from a line order system to place your order at the register and then sit down. I understand that probably makes it seem nicer BUT you can't see and customize your food as its being prepared. Also the majority of the tables were in serious need of being bused and wiped down. (I heard others with these same complaints while I was eating.)"}
{"text":"Legit one of the most poorly ran restaurants I've ever been to. 40 min to make broccoli cheddar soup?"}
{"text":"Just went into the newly remodeled Panera Bread on 7th St and Bell.  For all their ads about fresh carved, the turkey bravo sandwich is made from turkey breast you would find at any deli. The one strip of bacon on the sandwich was one of those precooked you can buy at the grocery store.  I threw the sandwich out, probably should have taken it back.  Sorely disappointed!  I don't think there was an improvement from Paradise Bakery to Panera."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery is AWESOME!!! I love the freshly tossed salads, like their Southwest Cesar Salad and a cold cup of their refreshing Mango Tea!!! 
DELICIOUS!!!! The service is always fun and enthusiastic!! 
 I give them an A+ for sure!!"}
{"text":"Went there this morning and service was super slow! It took 30 minutes for one breakfast sandwich and the order was wrong.  The manager Barbara seemed like she had NO clue what was going on."}
{"text":"This location went downhill fast with all their recent changes. Seems like a bunch of kids running the place that weren't trained correctly. Ordered a Mac and cheese in a bread bowl to go. Got to the vehicle and decided to check the bag and found just a regular Mac and cheese with no bread bowl (which I paid extra for.) Went back inside and the told the food prep person about the missing bread bowl and they sold \"oh that's what in a bread bowl meant\"...um duh? Also asked for a chicken salad sandwich with no tomato and a chicken poppyseed salad with no blueberries so of course when I got home I discovered tomato on my sandwich and blueberries on my salad, my bad for not checking those too before leaving I guess. Lesson learned, If you order something with a substitution or special request make sure you repeat yourself a bunch of times and double check your order before leaving if it's to go because it's most likely going to be wrong."}
{"text":"I love the cookies. The sandwiches are usually good, but sometimes they get a little crazy with making EVERYTHING too spicy. The soups are usually really excellent. Every time I've ordered a salad it's fabulous. They used to be one of the few places where you could get PibbMax from the fountain and then they discontinued it. The noise level is nearly deafening most of the time so you have to be ready for that."}
{"text":"This place use to be something special. Not sure if it's because they are switching over to being a Panera, or what, but portions, quality, service all going downhill. It's like they gave up? The food was still okay, but not like it use to be. We didn't even mind the construction stuff while we ate. They got our orders wrong, but were quick to fix it..and they served my bf a coffee, even tho he ordered an espresso. I only give 3 stars because they fixed our food (somewhat), otherwise I would give only 2 stars. Sorry to see them go!"}
{"text":"Chicken walnut on croissant bread is my favorite ... If only the service was just as great. Love Paradise Bakery, but this one, without fail always seems to mess up orders. Whether its forgetting that bacon goes on the club, undercooking steak on the panini or giving the wrong bread even though its written on the receipt, they're always on top of getting it wrong. My support goes to PB, but not this location."}
{"text":"O...M....G! Orange scones! Do I really need to say more? Ok they're sweet and moist and about as opposite a dry crumbly scone as you can get. Their coffee mixes, yeah, wonderful. So what their inside a mall, little noisy sure but soooo convenient. My tummy was happier afterwards than if I'd had sabaro or subway. Thank you for being a better alternative."}
{"text":"I do not like the new system. I can't make sure my salad is made correctly and I feel like they skimp on ingredients. My boyfriend ordered a steak sandwich which turned out to have way more vegetables and bread than steak. Miss the old Paradise."}
{"text":"I usually go to the PB on McDowell and Estrella and I still prefer that location.  The food here is just as good and so is the service.  Just not too fond of the layout.

Great sandwiches, soups and getting a \"free\" cookie is definitely a plus!"}
{"text":"Just a warning, the chippers are totally addicting! B&W chippers and Oatmeal Chocolate Chip, tiny little cookies that disappear very quickly when I bring a box to the office! Other excellent choices - 
-SW Chicken Caesar Salad (ask for a little extra dressing, it's awesome and they never put enough on)
-Walnut Chicken Salad sandwich
-Fire-roasted Tomato Soup with tortilla strips and sour cream

Paradise bakery also has some of the best iced tea in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I've been here a plethora of times, but I am very disappointed with the recent changes. Instead of going through the line and ordering your items you order at the beginning and then sit down and all of your food is brought to you. They did this in an attempt to make things faster, unfortunately it took the good customer service out of it. The ordering process is much more complicated and you are unable to see the menus. They give you a printed menu to combat this, but it isn't as simple as the ones that are hanging and divided by station. Trying to make specifications on your order, which used to be so simple, is now complicated and the staff taking orders clearly aren't trained well on it. To top it off, my food came out wrong, which is indicative of the poor way the ordering is set up.

Trying to get someone to clean off a table for you to sit down during busy times is clearly too much to ask for. The food is good, but I will no longer continue to come here. If this is how all Paradise Bakery locations function now, I won't be going to any of them. You have lost a very loyal customer and I know I'm not the only one."}
{"text":"We order from here at least once a week.  It is great cause you could eat there every day for a week and always get something different.  Just keep an eye on your take out orders, we've had a few items either messed up or missing.  Otherwise awesome place!"}
{"text":"We were introduced to Paradise by a local realtor, who took us to lunch on our first day of house hunting.  The salads were very fresh and all the ingredients were top notch.  I would say you can't go wrong here!  We will be regulars here after we relocate."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and visit the PHX several times a year. I ALWAYS look forward to going to Paradise Cafe. I have to go at least twice on every visit and sometimes hit the one up at the airport. I give this location a generous 3 star only because I love the restaurant as a whole. Almost every other Paradise I have been to has been 5 stars. Unfortunately this location was some what of a disappointment. I saw the site about a new smoothie B-green. I thought it would be a nice change. Well by the time I got to the end of the line to pay they bring me this drink that was grayish in color. They informed me that they had ran out of bananas (which is the base for the drink) and made it wi yogurt instead. I informed them that I was lactose intolerant and they ask if they could make me the same drink without the yogurt or a different smoothie. I asked what ones were dairy free and was told they all have yogurt. Umm ok I was thinking to myself why would they offer me something they know I can't have. I asked for a refund and that was that. 

  After sitting down I noticed that the staff was sweeping the store. I noticed that they had swept everything into a line in the middle of each walking area. It seemed that the lines of dirt and food crumbs were there for quite some time after sitting down. It was there long enough for me to eat my salad and have to look at filth swept into a pile. Finally the staff member came by with a dust mop and got all the dirt line in the store. Still sitting and eating after the sweeping was done I wondered why he even swept in the first place or if he did. There was still food, napkins and other things under most of the tables in my section. 

Again don't get me wrong I love this chain. The food is ALWAYS great and it one of the place I look forward to going to each visit. I just wish it was a cleaner like the rest of the Paradise's I have visited."}
{"text":"Just when I thought this place couldn't get any worse, it did. Eating lunch on Saturday, lukewarm soup, dirty spoon,  the rolls are inferior compared to PB and service ( when you get it) is slow..may not be back again...very disappointing."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. Originally, it was meant to be a two star review, with complaints about an extremely unsavory visit. I actually put in a complaint with corporate, who emailed me back promptly. But what really made me change my mind was the manager who called me a few days later. He went above and beyond any customer service standards and truly made me, as a customer, feel like my business was appreciated. He was kind and professional and even offered coupons for free sandwiches and such, which I did not take because my complaint wasn't to get any free stuff, I just wanted to let them know. He let me know that if I ever changed my mind they'd be there. I've gone back several times since then (never used the coupons) and each time has been a pleasant experience with satisfying food as well as customer service. Completely changed my mind about this place. And now I have even become somewhat of a regular customer, with some of the employees knowing my order by heart now. Definitely a delightful place in the heart of surprise."}
{"text":"Yummy lunch.  Not closed!

Best soups and sandwiches!

Try the chicken salad with a soup.

My son loves the turkey plain with chicken noodle.

$20 avg for two people."}
{"text":"Written by my 7 year old:  The grilled cheese was delicious!!  I like how they get a cookie for the kids meal!!!"}
{"text":"Have been eating here for the past three days only because I'm working at San Tan temporarily. 

I've eaten at different times ranging from 12pm to about 2pm. Every time I've been in the place is super busy. There are many tables to pick from but for the most part they are overflowing with trash. I'm not sure why ppl can't clean up after themselves Or maybe have the employees keep better watch. 

The food was okay, I've had better tasting food at other Paradise Bakery locations. For some reason my soups have been warm,  not hot."}
{"text":"Very rarely can you go wrong here, my 800 calorie lunch is a testament to that!

Within the past year they changed their look and added to their menu. I love the grilled chicken sandwhich I had, and their baked potatoe soup, while not as good as the Corner Bakery across the Loop 101 to the East, is still great.

Their bread bowls are fantastic, but they tend to run out of them at night time hours.

I love the veggie omlet if you make it for the mornings,
and my favorite cookie, their ginger molasses....I can eat those all day!!!!"}
{"text":"My friend's sandwich took 15 minutes to be brought out. By that time I had nearly finished my salad. It wasn't even busy that day, there was hardly a line. When the sandwich did come, it didn't have any kind of dressing or condiments. Who wants a dry sandwich? I successfully garnered a side of mayonnaise to remedy the situation. The manager was informed about the long wait and dry sandwich and nothing was done about it. Salad was good,  but the inattention to detail and customer service were disappointing. I'll probably go back but not for a while. The salad was good but they need to get their sh*t together."}
{"text":"If there was an option for no stars I would have given that. Everybody in here was rude today and just seemed like they had something better to do. I should have went next door to five guys. At least they like their customers. Between the first girl rolling her eyes at me and the cashier rushing us to pay, we sure didn't feel very welcome."}
{"text":"Went in to order a flatbread sandwich and a cup of broccoli cheddar. No flatbread and no broccoli cheddar (both were still advertised). So, I ordered a flatbread sandwhich on sourdough and my husband ordered half a pasta and half a sandwhich. We also got the buy one get one cookies. Our total was just over $17 and I found out they only gave me a half sandwhich as well by the time we got home to eat. This location is no good. Plenty of other places to choose from around here so don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I have to give it a four because their prices are pretty outrageous. I could get a sit down meal for the same price as soup and a sandwich here. But speaking of sandwiches the tuna is great. Not heavy on the mayo like many other places and there's a nice variety of soups and salads. They automatically give you a chocolate chip cookie but I feel they should ask before putting it in the bag as I always throw them away . Maybe a second cookie option would be nice."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.
All the tables are dirty and needed to be bussed. 
The table we sat at still needed to be wiped off.
The Cobb salad had brown avocados in it.
We will not be returning to this location!!!"}
{"text":"I come here quite often for lunch breaks at work and I normally either order the Greek salad w/ chicken or the cranberry turkey sandwich, both very tasty by the way! They are normally very quick for to-go orders and I always try to call ahead to guarantee its ready because it does get very busy at lunch time. Only complaint I had was a cranberry turkey sandwich I bought a couple weeks ago was super soggy once I took it out of its bag when I barely picked it up minutes prior. But all in all its a clean place which friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this particular location but I've been to a lot of paradise bakeries. Though the prices are extremely high the food is awesome. I love their breakfast."}
{"text":"I gave this place so many chances and they failed so hard each time. Found a piece of plastic in my food once. The food itself is always so bland that it's mind boggling. A cheap TV dinner has more flavor than their food (which is probably made up from cheap TV dinners) and the prices they charge? Like, 8 bucks for a tiny tiny portion, a tiny little half assed excuse of anything that is the blandest thing you'll ever eat.

As if that is not bad enough, the service is downright terrible. There's been a few locations where the ladies were halfway friendly, but this location has had a few who act like you should already be fully aware of their stupid, pointless, dumb as hell little ordering system (that makes no sense) and that if you have a question you're a huge inconvenience.

If I was given a free gift card to Paradise Bakery for free food, I think I'd either sell it or just throw it away. I've been to Panera Bread and Wildflower. Both are awesome, for some reason this place fails hard."}
{"text":"One of the dirtiest paradise bakery I've been to.  Rude employees. Food poorly prepared. Was given attitude when I asked about remaking my sandwich. Finally just asked for refund. Will not be returning to this location, and recommend to not waste your time and money at thi location."}
{"text":"The kitchen is very unorganized. Just sit back and watch the chaos. Every time I visit there is a long wait in line to pay and to get your food. I love their menu choices otherwise..."}
{"text":"This place gets the job done if you want inexpensive, tasty food. The service used to be far faster, especially during lunch on a weekday when everyone stops in for a quick lunch before heading back to their 9-5. The past two times I have gone in it is extremely slow, almost as if no one is prepared for a lunch crowd. First you see everyone moving slowly then scrambling like it was unexpected. I always feel for these young people who work here and just want to help them. Hopefully they can hire more bodies in there and get a better system in place. 

Service - 2 stars for taking 20 min to get a cold sandwich made

Friendliness - 4 stars since they are always polite and apologetic

Food - 4 stars since the food is delicious and you know what to expect

Hopefully someone can get them some help at this location so they aren't so behind each lunch shift!"}
{"text":"Just tried the new Panera menu and it was good. Soup and sandwiches are good and the service was great. And you still get cookies with your sandwich order. Good place to eat!"}
{"text":"I love their Mediterranean chicken flatbread, fire roasted tomato soup, and their big kid grilled cheese! Always clean and pretty good customer service!"}
{"text":"I rarely come to places like these, but I was looking for somewhere to stop and enjoy some nourishment while I allow traffic to die down. I ordered the Tomato soup, which was not normally served at 730am from what I gathered. Jennifer was the epitome of customer service. She talked to the cook staff and asked them to make it for me, she brought it to me, and even grabbed napkins, and utensils for me so I didn't have to get up. She made me feel completely welcome. For a guy that was coming in not expecting much,  just a cup of Joe, and a something light to eat. I left feeling compelled to compliment the service here! Thank you Jennifer ;-)"}
{"text":"Fantastic as usual. I don't get some of the comments on here other than people having axes to grind. Had the ham and Swiss on eye and a cup of chicken noodle. Both just as expected. And it's refreshing that this place actually has fresh brewed ice tea. You can taste the freshness in everything. Super friendly people here too. I'll be back."}
{"text":"What is it with this place?  Why do these particular employees of this store have such a weird attitude towards customers?  My husband whos the most mild mannered guy goes into the store to order a salad today .  There were 4 people behind the counter over by the pick up area.  They were talking or milling about who knows.  Waited 10 minutes then you had to finally say hey can I order something?  They said oh sure did you want to buy a paper?  He said I wanted to order some food actually and the girl says oh.  So that was enough to piss him off he said screw it I will go over to Wild Flower right next door.  Apparently they had just screwed up 3 orders and my husband overheard someone asking hey whats with this order whats with this one and each person behind the counter replied I dont know, i dont know, etc.   So all of that was just not worth it to him.  He didnt want his order screwed up too.  just wanted to get that out there because the experience is almost always the same there oh and I am PISSED because I wanted a fuji apple salad!  I was mad that my husband didnt take the torture and get me my salad so I now put the blame on you Paradise.  Do something about your people or your processes.  Teach your employees to greet people and to treat each person that comes in as if they are going to order something!  Make it so that it is not uncomfortable for us to go into your store and try to interact with your unwilling and uninviting employees.  Teach them some teamwork.  Why do each of them act like oh thats not my job.  That is so weird and even gross behavior."}
{"text":"Well I guess you can't accuse Paradise Bakery of contributing to the obesity epidemic in America. I'm not sure the breakfasts could get any smaller, but they will likely try. I really enjoyed the sides of white bread and the foggy iced tea with the look and consistency of thick, creamy apple cider though..."}
{"text":"DO NOT GET ORDERS TO GO!  Why can't these people get to go orders correct?  This is the third time we have ordered lunch for the office from this location...and the third time they have screwed it up!  2 of us got the Crumbly Blue Cheese salads WITH CHICKEN, paid for the salads WITH CHICKEN but when we took them out of the bag, guess what?  NO CHICKEN!  We also ordered cookies, paid for cookies but these cookies didn't make it into the bag.  Don't even get me started on the errors with the sandwiches!  Since this is the third time this has happened in the last few months, I'm familiar with the poor attitude of the Paradise Bakery folks who handle disgruntled lunch eaters such as myself.  I am not willing to subject myself to this attitude in order to get this resolved.  I will not go back.  In short. if you want your to go lunch order to be screwed up, order from this place!"}
{"text":"Food is always decent to good. Always fresh and clean. Good taste with \"better\" quality ingredients A nice change from any fast food or the run of th mill greasy sppon joint. Healthier options and all around OK."}
{"text":"If I could leave zero stars I would. Very dirty, bathrooms not kept up, prices exorbitant for what you get, terrible service, ordered no mayo and sandwich sure enough came with mayo and when returning it to get one without mayo it was as if I was putting them out."}
{"text":"If I could eat a southwestern Caesar salad once a day, every day, I think I would. This is one of my favorite salads...ever. Paradise in general is a little overpriced but one in a while, I'll bite the bullet and splurge. My only complaint is their lack of vegetarian options. For a restaurant that specializes in soups, salads and sandwiches, it would make sense to have more than one or two options in each category suitable for veggies."}
{"text":"Awful customer service! I believe the sandwich boy of the days name was Harley... Well it took Harley over 20 minutes to make a turkey sandwich, Pretty basic & he managed to mess it up. The line wrapping towards the door didn't seem to speed the staff up either as they just stood around and the manager didn't do sh%+ either."}
{"text":"One star? This place is awesome!!! 
The best cookies I ever had! 
The lunch was fat, fresh, and cheap. The combination that never happens. 
The atmosphere was super nice too. 
Def. coming back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Clean, staff is friendly, great selection on the menu. On our recent visit to az we ate here three times. First time I had a turkey cranberry sandwich and BBQ chicken salad, second time rigatoni bolognese and salad, third time French onion soup and a club croissant. Everything was great. Fresh food, salads mixed to order. The choc chip cookies are melt in your mouth delicious. Wish we had PB in Minnesota!"}
{"text":"Always rude & annoyed with every customer .. Always forgets food .. Only thing good about this location is the food ."}
{"text":"Never a clean table to be found; this continued throughout my hour-long stay. Food was really awful. One person's food was not prepared correctly and had to go back. The chicken on my salad was almost inedible. Fatty, gristly. What bothers me the most though is how unclean it is. If it looks like that out front, I don't want to know how it is in the back prepping and cooking area. I will never return this particular location. Having been in management, I tend to feel it is the fault of management. Get a danged employee to go clean tables!"}
{"text":"I love this location!  I am there every Fri morning for my business meeting. The staff is always friendly and the food is always great!  Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Over the past couple of years the service levels have really dropped.  Ironically, it seemed to be about the same time that they stopped putting the survey on the receipts.  Whenever there is a line, they just can't manage it effectively.  It gets backed up in one place or another, the sandwich area, the salad area, the soup area, or the cashier area; there just aren't enough people working there.  The managers always seem lost and are late to step in and assist when assistance is needed.

I noticed that right when it was announced that Kneaders was coming that Paradise adjusted their hours to match.  Sadly, the service wasn't improved.  If you're trying to keep people from deflecting over to Kneaders (probably due to long lines and  mediocre service), you might try harder.  

Who had the bright idea to remove the list of ingredients from all the menus.  If I don't know what is in something, I have to ask.  Before I could just look at the menu and decide.  I'm not the only one doing this either, and it is part of the reason for the slow lines.

Oh, and would you fix the lights in the parking lot already!?  They've been out for months!"}
{"text":"Went for father's day breakfast...will not return!
Poor attitudes through out staff...poor food..."}
{"text":"I stopped by this Paradise Bakery location today and ordered a half sandwich and salad, roasted turkey artichoke and chopped chicken cobb, to go.  When I got home I attacked my salad with the fury of 10,000 screaming Dothraki raiders...  it didn't last long, the salad was delicious.  That's when the horde, that was my hunger, turned its attention to the isolated and vulnerable half sandwich.  The attack was over as quickly as it began.  It came as great surprise that the half sandwich had erected impenetrable stone defenses otherwise known as bread.

Sad day you say?  I think not!

I called the location to voice my complaint, the bread on the sandwich was burnt and rock hard.  By this time the store had closed, but the very sweet manager not only offered me a whole sandwich to replace the concrete half sandwich, but a full refund as well.  I drove back got my sandwich, a refund and a bag of free cookies.

The food at every Paradise Bakery I've been to has been good, but the customer service tonight was incredible.  That to me is what sets any establishment apart from the rest.  The food at any random place could be great but if the service is lacking and unfriendly I will never return.  I will be back."}
{"text":"It must have been shift change time when I stopped in for a small snack. The manager was taking orders and then ran down the line to work the register while I saw three employees lounging about in uniform. The register was so backed up that my order came while I was still in line and the gal plopped my dish onto the counter in front of the register. How classy."}
{"text":"It's about time I review this place.  I am pretty sure everyone in here knows me (possibly even by name) since I frequent here weekly on my lunch break.  I am always impressed with how attentive all the staff is, and appreciate how they try to move things along quickly when it gets busy.  I hope they never switch to Panera!"}
{"text":"Short version: If you can help it, go to another Paradise Bakery.

Long version: Of all the Paradise Bakeries I've been to this one is consistently the worst but it's the closest to home. Had my heart set on a Chicken Walnut Sandwich tonight but the guy said \"we are out of molasses bread\" and just stared at me. No apologies. Just stood there and looked annoyed at me for picking a sandwich they didn't have the bread for. My bad bro. Admittedly I don't come here for the service but common courtesy would be nice. 

We get catering for our monthly meetings at the one at Biltmore all the time and they seem to be better."}
{"text":"Worst $11 I've ever spent. I usually make my own salad since not many of there's have a lot of vegetables in it. Sorry I gave their menu a try. The tomato soup was too potent. The Thai chicken salad seriously only had lettuce and chicken....sure there were nuts, but again that's it??? Never again. I'll stick with Wildflower were I can get at least two or three vegetables in my salad."}
{"text":"Not bad for a sandwich shop.  Far superior to Subway."}
{"text":"Arrived at 10:25am and decided to grab lunch to go and take to the office with me. The place was essentially dead so I thought it would be a quick pick up. The young gal who took my order was very nice and helpful. And then I waited....and waited....and waited. I finally flagged down a nice lady who appeared to be in management and asked where my order was. Then I waited some more. Finally I got it and once in my car decided to check in the bag. Glad I did. I ordered a small caesar to go with my sandwich and got a small caesar with chicken. So, I walked back in with the wrong salad and asked for the correct one. The young man who appeared to be in charge of making the salads seemed especially irritated. He also did not apologize when he finally gave me the correct salad. All total, to get my complete \"to go\" order of a tuna sandwich and small caesar and leave there, 25 minutes. Completely unacceptable. I won't be back to this location. Clearly my order was just too much for them."}
{"text":"Ordered scrambled egg breakfast and received grey eggs!  I was afraid to eat them! 2 pieces of paper thin bacon with a small cup of 7 pieces of fruit with a cup of coffee for $9. Disappointing. Maybe paradise bakery should look into why? I will not get eggs here again."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped in recently to pick up some dinner. The staff was friendlier at this location than other PBs I've been to. My mac and cheese was nice and hot and the food was ready to go by the time we finished paying our bill. Would come back to to this location again. :D"}
{"text":"Being new to the area, I didn't know this but... Paradise Bakery is Arizona's Panera.

I ordered a You-Pick-Two with a turkey sandwich and side salad. The sandwich was delicious and identical to the Panera equivalent (sierra turkey); the salad was also quite good and not something I'd ever had from Panera. It was a standard salad with a vinaigrette dressing.

The ordering process was a bit awkward to me with the salad bar (this is NOT like Panera). It seemed a bit unnecessary, but that might just be my Panera fandom talking.

The prices are akin to Panera in that... it's overpriced. Don't get me wrong though; the food and service was all great, but it's just difficult to swallow a $10+ price on a half-and-half lunch combo.

BOTTOM LINE: Pricy but delicious. I won't come here often, but only when I get a craving for Panera."}
{"text":"Great salads/sandwiches/ cookies are the best.. Nothing super special, very consistent, same thing every time. Changed, food good service is very bad I hate panera. Which is what they are changing to.

Update went for dinner 5/6 tried again to give the another shot and they messed up my order again. I asked to speak to the manager who is like 20 and she blamed the incorrect order on their new system. The one that is by my work has switched and I never have this problem."}
{"text":"The last 2 times I've been here, I ordered my usual: Sierra Turkey and the Mac and cheese. Both times I sit down with my number and wait. And both times I wait some more. I see them bring food to people who got here after me. Finally I go up and ask, and it's like they totally forgot my order. What is it about me? Is it my big blue eyes that are deep and intense like an ocean swell? Have I offended the turkey Gods? Whatever it is I'm losing my patience.

Anyway, when I finally get my food, my sandwich has no cheese on it! I go up to fix the problem, and the guy at the counter tries to tell me the Sierra Turkey doesn't come with onions. Well if that's the case who do I thank for hooking it up the last 20 times I was here? Because a sandwich with meat and lettuce is no sandwich at all.

Anyway the food is decent, service sucks. 

/rant"}
{"text":"I really don't like giving bad reviews..but really, I need to.  The food is fine, not exceptional, but the service is pretty poor.  I could be spoiled though.  We used to go to Panara Bakery in KC, which owns Paradise Bakery here in the valley.  I was expecting the same sort of service and food. We went to Paradise one Sunday afternoon and  I was trying to figure out what to have, and well, yeah, I do count calories.  I asked how many calories in a specific item and the guy behind the counter said he didn't know, and said, \"Here\", and pushed their giant book of calories over to me.  He really was rude.  Anyway, not everyone there is like that, but honestly, it left an impression on me. There ya have it."}
{"text":"This place should not exist outside of a mall.  They literally have no organization to ordering. This was my first time here and I walked up until I get between the \"salad and sandwich\" menus before encountering any employees. Then they ask if I want a salad. That presumptuous. But then again I did pass a beverage, bagel and breakfast menu board (without finding any employees). Because I ordered a sandwich she walked back to apparently that ordering area where they, I guess, should have employees. Ok, so the service/ordering sucks. 

I order a sandwich (turkey avocado) small drink - $11:48. Yep, the price of a waiter style burger (Red Robin) or other service style restaurant. Not this cafeteria style one. 

Skip this place unless you're at the mall."}
{"text":"I don't really go here for the food, but I DO enjoy the Asian Chicken Salad when I visit. Their cookies are pretty yummy, too (but cookies ARE pretty hard to mess up LOL). I've had consistently good, friendly service from the staff. 

This location is near the barn where my daughter leases a horse and takes her riding lessons - it's a great place to hang out while I'm waiting for her. Spacious, comfortable booths (each with an outlet to plug in my laptop) and free WIFI means I can settle in and get quite a bit of work done. I'm very glad for this convenient neighborhood annex to my home office! 

This is not the place for a quiet interlude. Most times I'm there, it's pretty noisy. Since I often have my almost-three year old in tow, we fit right in with the happy chaos. It's located in the San Tan mall so my teens can set off and window shop or get some ice cream while I'm working. Great place for meet-ups, too."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh sandwiches, soft gooey cookies, sweet moist pastries. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"The staff here is always rude and just seems like they don't want to be there. They also have been dishing out smaller and smaller portions every time I go. I'm not sure if they're trying to save money or what but I paid $6 for a salad that I could see the bottom of the carton before I even ate any of it. The only redeeming factor from my most recent trip was Nick. After the guy who was taking sandwich orders walked away as I approached, Nick came up to drop off trays and realized I hadn't been helped so he assisted me. He is the nicest person I've ever dealt with here. He was very pleasant and communicated well with me. If it wasn't for him I wouldn't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"I'm being generous to give this place four stars. However they are still slightly above average. My wife had the hot Chai tea. It wasn't too bad. I've had better but I've certainly has much worse. I ordered an omelette that was pretty good. I was disappointed with how small it was. I expected it to be larger. The fruit on the plate was super good. I could not find ketchup and asked for ketchup....ok..who in the heck does not have ketchup when you serve eggs? And they weren't just out. They didn't have ketchup. I thought that was odd. However, the food was still good. The service was fine. The establishment was clean. I would go back."}
{"text":"I've been here when it's busy and when it's slow, I don't have any huge complaints but I went to lunch with my friend and they completely brought her the wrong sandwich! Breakfast here is busy, the to go orders seem to take some precedence over in store customers which can be annoying if I'm in a hurry! Food is delish but cookies can be dry. Wondering if they are going to turn this Paradise Bakery into a Panera bread. They have done this with a few locations nearby."}
{"text":"I love everything about paradise bakery! I've never had any problems with the food or the service everyone is so nice and helpful and the food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"As expected, good food and decent prices. Try the half and half special and buy 1 cookie and get 1 free! Friendly staff, ample parking and lots of seating."}
{"text":"I go to Paradise Bakery fairly regularly in Surprise and while it's not perfect, the Chicken Walnut Salad sandwich and the chicken with wild rice soup call my name from time to time and I was taught to always come when I'm called.  I was heading out to the Wigwam today and stopped in at this Paradise Bakery location for a bite.  Lunch starts at 11. I stood right in front of the sandwich station watching a worker still making omelets and purposely said nothing, wondering when or if she would ever look up at me.  I do this from time to time to test the service and this PB failed. 

I knew she knew I was there but she made a point not to make eye contact with me until my friend came over from the bakery side after ordering her smoothie to ask me what the hold up was. I then said very loudly that I was still waiting for someone to take my sandwich order. It was 11:15. The omelet worker never did look at me when she asked someone to come over and take my order.  I placed my order for my sandwich and then got my soup. I had to wait for an employee to wander over to the cash register and then realize she didn't have a cash drawer in order to pay. More meadering employees before the cash drawer came.  I didn't get my sandwich until 11:30. I ordered a 1/2 chicken walnut salad sandwich. Nothing special...no changes to it. It took 15 minutes to get it and that would be 30 minutes after changing to lunch. That's unacceptable. 

I will skip this location in the future not just because of the slow change-over to lunch on a slow day but because the employees were just indifferent and slow and this is often indicative of a poor management team. I can spend my money at better places."}
{"text":"The service was friendly. I figured out a way to order a salad I like without being (over)charged for items I take off of it.  The food was fresh, salad was excellent, they have several iced tea choices (which I love) and they always give a free cookie. Who can complain? 

Hint-instead of an Apple Fuji salad minus chicken and onions, I got the crumbly blue and switched the dressing. I missed the apple chips but it was worth not paying $1+ more for a half salad."}
{"text":"While not a fan of the new layout because I find it confusing, the quality of the food is consistent. Appreciative of free wifi too.  The girl at the register was a tad snippy- too busy rushing to listen to customers nets questions or answer politely - thus the 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is generally a good place to go for a nice ladies type lunch. They have lady-fare with sandwiches, soups, and salads. Men get dragged here from time to time, but when you go in, it's mostly the ladies who are here cackling like hens in the hen house. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. My favorite is the chicken walnut salad sandwich. I get it on a croissant rather than the dark grain bread. 

This visit though, I came for breakfast. I've had their bagels and muffins but this time I ordered a vegetarian omelet. This came with fresh fruit, toast, and I ordered orange juice. The juice was fresh squeezed and it was delish. The fresh fruit was nice as well. The omelet...not so much. 

It was a good sized omelet with a squeeze of sour cream on it and some feta inside. It appeared well made with the right fold to it. I cut in and that's when the disappointment began.  When you order a vegetarian omelet...you expect veggies. This omelet had diced tomatoes and broccoli. That's it. Now I know that Paradise Bakery has more veggies than just that so I was moderately disappointed about that. Yes broccoli and tomatoes are veggies (well tomatoes are a fruit, but I digress) but if you call something a vegetarian omelet, PUT MORE THAN 2 VEGETABLES IN IT! 

What made me put out though was the fact that the broccoli was raw. It wasn't even remotely cooked and it was only slightly warmed by being wrapped up in egg which means that the broccoli was tossed on top of the egg which was then folded over to make the omelet shape. This means that the diced tomatoes were also raw as well. Not good.  So, I bring this to the attention of one of the service people who is nearby cleaning tables. They seem confused by what the problem is. I'm trying to explain about cross contamination, etc but it's clearly not part of the vocabulary of this person. So then I speak to the manager.  He at first argues with me that the broccoli is just al-dente. Now, I am a trained chef. I know the difference between al-dente and raw.  How he could even make that claim was beyond me because you could tell by looking at the broccoli that it was raw. I make him taste it. It's then he agrees that it was raw. We discuss cross contamination, safe food handling...He then just says well that's how we do it here. I see this conversation is going no where. I set my fork down, thank him for his time and tell him I am not interested in eating this omelet any longer. He offers not a refund, not a new omelet, nothing. 

I like PB for their sandwiches and soups but now that I know how they handle food at breakfast, I'm probably not going to go back there for lunch. They are an massive diarrhea episode waiting to happen and I don't have time in my life to risk that chance. So based on the raw food and the manager's inability to satisfy a customer, 1 star. And that's generous."}
{"text":"I usually really like Paradise Bakery, but this location is not so good. How do you mess up a chicken Caesar salad?  You put old croutons that are all stuck together on top of flimsy lettuce.  Then instead of fixing it, refund the old salad and charge for a new meal. What? Yeah lets inconvenience the customer that just got a gross salad. That's a good business practice."}
{"text":"'Bout time I wrote a review of this place, being as I'm here every few days. Surprisingly, it's my kid that asks to go eat here after school each day. His name for it is \"The Cookie Place\". He loves their PBJ sandwich along with the cookie (of course) and squeeze yoghurt included in the kids meal. I dither between two meals - either the ham and swiss sandwich with a small paradise pasta salad, or else one of their Fuji Apple Chicken salads which are freakin' delicious. With the sandwich I always ask for extra dijon vinagrette - the Fuji salad's special apple-flavoured dressing is almost worth buying a separate bottle of.

There's really not much else to be said about Paradise Bakery. The staff are reasonably familiar with me and if you have one of their loyalty cards, every 10th or 12th meal is free. Definitely works for regulars like us. They've got free wifi at the location and it's amazing how many people bring their laptops in - like Starbucks. All I do is check in with Yelp. And hey, I'm the Duke (at time of writing). Woo hoo. If only that actually MEANT something.

Consistent food, quick service, friendly, the place is clean, it's local to me, and every member of my family likes it. Makes it a five star establishment far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service ever. Rude young people in a hurry to get out of work. Salad thrown together with a no regard to what she was doing. When she didn't see a scooper I was afraid that she was going to use her hands without gloves. I will never come back to this location."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the dark roast coffee and cranberry muffin."}
{"text":"The Chicken Cesar salad was delicious and my toddler devoured most of her buttered noodles. The prices are rather steep for the items served. $4.95 for a small bowl of buttered noodles is a bit steep, don't you think?   Anytime I've been here, the line that develops and how it's handled by the staff is rather chaotic. Neither staff nor customer seems to under how the line is organized. No sandwich means I go in front of the people ordering sandwiches? Just wanting soup means I go in front of those ordering sandwiches or salad? Tis confusion."}
{"text":"Been here many times but stopped going because they time how long you can use their internet (short time) and then it turns off. Doesn't matter if you are with a large party and everyone is eating. Internet is times and management cannot turn it back on. Too many other places want my business and will provide Internet so I can work. Won't miss Paradise Bakery."}
{"text":"I still go to Paradise Bakery but I need to take it down a couple of stars due to a couple of reasons.  Filth and the need for more staff.  

Not to long ago this place was my the place to go for a good healthy meal.  But it seems that keeping the place clean is not longer a priority for management.  A little bit of soap and water would do this place a great deal of good.  

And it seems that with all the extra people in town, keeping the place adequately staffed would be somewhat important.  I was in Paradise Bakery 2 days ago and the line was out the door - and only one cashier and not near enough staff was available to prepare the orders.  

I'm sure it will improve once the ballgame crowd is gone and the snowbirds are back home but for now - one of my favorite eateries seems to be struggling."}
{"text":"Ugh. Just close this location and put it out of it's misery. Horrible service. Dirty tables, floors, patio. The cafe line sits abandoned, which was a large part of what made Paradise a great place. Watch your salad/soup being created, faster service. The Panera buy-out sucks. Stopped in for a last-minute cookie run for a school event and the counter person was put off that I was taking all of her cookies (3 dozen) and she would need to make more."}
{"text":"This is how it all went down. I thought it would be nice to go out really quick and have a Mommie and Son dinner. Kinda rude staff, whatever I shrug it off and chalk it up to Holiday customer service blues. Then I get to the register, I am carrying my 15 month old, they bring all my food to the register, I get a crappy, half assed \"Um, do you need help to your table\" \"No, I've got it, thanks\" THEN I go find a highchair, WOW nasty doesn't begin to describe them, I opt for the somewhat cleaner booster seat. Dust off the crumbs on the only available booth (The junk in-between the cushions, as well as the mystery smears on the wall next to the table should have been a clear sign of RUN) we sit down to eat. I'm finally calming down about the high chair situation, eat my half a sandwich, get half way through my salad, then, wait, did my lettuce just move, (set fork down) WHAT THE HELL!@#!! (see photo) I take my salad plate up to staff and tell them that I'm not upset but that they may need to throw their lettuce out, I get a sight eye roll and a \"Why whats wrong with it\" Then I said \"look at the fork \"OH MY GOD!!\" she calls what I assume is the manager over, he's sitting at a table in the dining room chatting up some girl, he so professionally replies \"WHAT DO YOU WANT\" she told him through her teeth that he needed to come over. He saw what was up, then he followed me to the cash register and offered me, get this, a BAG OF CHIPS, I told him \"things like this happen, forget it\", I gather my things to leave, turn around to see if they are doing anything about the lettuce, didn't seem like it, I did hear one of the staff tell the girl the manager was talking to \"Oh, it was only a lettuce bug\"  I can understand the bug, things happen, I'm a pretty calm mellow person, but the attitude and the way they treat their customers is really sad."}
{"text":"I tried the big kid grilled cheese with a side of tomato soup. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"With fresh baked breads, crisp veggies, amazing sandwich creations, and some of the best cookies in town. Paradise is one of my regular lunch spots. Often two to three times a week!"}
{"text":"They need to take a serious look at their employees behavior. I made a comment to the manager about adding a little milk to the disgusting oatmeal and the little hipster went off about they have half and half at the coffee station.  I guess he missed customer service 101. Overall it is a nasty disgusting place that I can't believe San Tan Village allows to stay open."}
{"text":"Recently went here with my kids and some other families and we were not too impressed.  While the food was good, the service was pretty bad.  The food runner kept forgetting to bring items for all of the kids meals.  It made for a somewhat unrelaxing meal."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Paradise for about a year. Was fairly good until they implemented a new ordering system tonight.

Nothing but a headache!!!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed the service last night! The cashier was friendly, quick and welcoming."}
{"text":"Paradise Lost.  Got the order wrong, food bad, dry dry bread, avocados like rocks, never again.  18 buck lunch (no drinks).  Friend ordered a whole chicken/walnut on croissant, got a half dry wheat bread sandwich with a small scoop of chicken salad, they did it over.  The receipt was correct, apparently they can't figure out the tickets.  (3pm, store was dead)  My Cobb salad had avocados so green they were hard and inedible and a half an egg.  What kind of Cobb is that?  Also ordered a half turkey/cranberry.  Pictures say it all . . . more of that dry dry brown bread, one folded-in-half Safeway Farmer John's plastic package turkey slice, 2 thin tomatoes, lettuce and maybe 1/4 tsp cranberry.  Ick.  And the staff seemed clueless.  Ate the salad, took the sandwich home for a Kodak moment and a souveneir.  As my friend said \"I'm really glad we went here today so I know to never ever go back again.\"  Yeah."}
{"text":"Ordered turkey sandwich minus the bacon...got home still found bacon and had to drive back...hostess asked me to keep the bacon sandwich which confused me as why would i keep something i did not order...just wasted my time driving...oh when i called the phone they refused to let me talk to a manger telling me manager is busy...."}
{"text":"When I arrived I stood to the side so I can figure out what to order. Once I decided I went up to the register. A girl looked at me but was too busy talking to the guys making sandwiches. I thought maybe I was in the wrong place to order. She didn't say anything to me so I moved in front of the sandwich making station and still didn't get acknowledged. The girl who looked at me earlier told someone else she can take their order. I then  moved to the soup serving station. I was finally acknowledged and told that section of the restaurant was closed and needed to go to the register. I told her the girl ignored me even after making Eye contact with me. She said well that's where you need to order if you want food. The girl who had ignored me just smiled at me and didn't even apologize.  Her customer apologized to me though. She needs to work on her customer service skills."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Standing in line with my one year old baby, and he burps up maybe a straws worth of liquid..I get out of line to ask the cashier girl for some napkins to clean the spit up, so other customers don't slip/fall on it. The young teenage girl hands me TWO napkins! Never once did she offer to have someone help clean it. So I'm standing there with spitup napkins in my hand, looking for a trash can, something/anything to get rid of it, so I could order. Nothing around...and the same teenage girl is looking at me, giving me the \"I don't care it's not my problem look\".  By then I'm so 
pissed off, I walk out, not even ordering food. 

By the looks of it from other reviews, I guess this is what anyone can expect from visiting this establishment, crappy service!!!!"}
{"text":"This Paradise Bakery is one of the few spots to grab a healthy salad in the fast food Bell strip through Surprise. Their cookies are excellent and their salads are great.

One of the employees even loaned my an iphone 6 charger which really saved the day.

Great service
Great food
Nice ambiance

Caveat....get here early on weekdays and on Saturday's and Sundays this place is a human zoo! 

Does anyone work in Surprise?"}
{"text":"So glad this made it to North Phoenix, if only it had happened while I was growing up there!

TONS of options for breakfast and lunch and everything is delicious and enormous. It's a little costly, but when you see how much you're getting, it makes sense."}
{"text":"I'm  only giving one star because it's required in order to leave a review... This was by far my worst experience at a Paradise Bakery. Normally, it is one of my favorite places to get soup and salad. Today, it all changed.  

I ordered a chicken ceasar salad and french onion soup. Seems simple enough, right? Well they got it all wrong. For starters, the lettuce was brown at the edges and the green pieces were limp. The dressing was bland, same for the chicken. My soup was luke warm at best. The cheese was clumped together at the bottom of my bowl and the croutons were soggy upon arrival to the table. I can only assume it was already prepared and had been sitting out for awhile. My boyfriend ordered the meal, except he had the black bean soup. He stated that his soup wasnt terrible, but had the same issue with his salad. We asked for pepper to add some flavor to our food, but they were all out of pepper and pepper packets. How do you run out of pepper? To top it off, no cookie with the You Pick Two...

My food was so terrible that I doubt I will ever return... Unless someone else is paying and I have no other restaurant options."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see this new Paradise Bakery  so close to home. 
Not only is on the way to many things we do and a Super Target  it is near my husband's work , so we technically could act like we are meeting him for dinner but really just want Paradise.   
So far the food here seems to be still being fined tuned. On the day we 
stopped in they seemed to be inconsistent in portion size  and service. But I have faith in them that will soon have that figured out! 
This is a super place to meet for lunch or have a bite to eat away from work ."}
{"text":"I came here for 3 or 4 days in a row during our first week in our new home - we didn't have internet set up yet and I had to work.  So I brought in my laptop got some coffee and set up my little mobile office.  Great coffee and great environment, and the free wireless internet is a bonus.  I also like the free samples as you come in!  Lol.  I'm sure I'll be popping in here again in the future when I'm shopping at the mall."}
{"text":"1/2 a California turkey on paradise bread hold all spread (pesky mayo, aioli or pesto whatever fancy name you want to call it) and may I please have a ginger molasses cookie instead of chocolate chip? 

My staple this past week & 1/2 for lunch. 

I like it...I really like it."}
{"text":"Handy place to meet a friend, being right of I-10.  We had a good meal and enjoyed a big booth that gives some privacy and break from all the noise.

Food is good and the service is what you might expect from a glorified cafeteria. They do have bus staff that are very friendly.

And a free cookie with any sandwich!"}
{"text":"I went to this cafe today at 5:50 and ordered a salad. When i opened my bag i saw I didnt get dressing, a fork, or the free cookie they give. I called because I spent $5 on a salad im now not going to eat because no dressing. The manager anwsered and said \"okay, do you want a free cookie.\" I said i guess, obviously not pleased and he just hung up. I work in food and have worked at Panera Bread, i thought this was ridiculous."}
{"text":"The cookies are still wonderful, but they changed the bbq chicken chopped salad and I don't like it.  Instead of fresh tasting corn, they now have a sort of southwest corn mixture with onion and bell pepper.  I really don't like it at all.  Also, the chicken isn't really chopped... it's cut in strips.  I wish they would go back to the old way of"}
{"text":"Their coconut chocolate chip cookies will set you free!"}
{"text":"Place is OK, I'm just not a big fan of what they have to offer! It's funny reading some of the complaints! People get a grip! Food is good, place is a cafe style, so your service is really up to you! Cookies are really good, my wife enjoys their sandwiches."}
{"text":"I grew up eating at Paradise Bakery in California - it is funny because there aren't any left in No Cal, but they are in AZ now!!??!!  I come for the nibblers, my kids go for the Mac and Cheese.  I am not a fan of the \"free cookie\", I am not a big chocolate person - WHAT - I know!!  And the cookies are chalked full of chocolate.  Otherwise, I love the place.  Can't complain - which makes it a great day!!"}
{"text":"I like Paradise Bakery. They have a nice breakfast variety as well as lunch/dinner menu of salads, sandwiches and soups. I particularly like the tuna salad and often pair  a half sandwich with a half salad. The nice touch is also the chocolate chop cookie they give you. I know it's always a welcome sweet treat after every meal there.  They have a nice assortment of baked goods as well. One of my favorites is the banana chocolate chip muffin. It is delicious. I feel like Paradise Bakery is well run and almost every one I go to is very similar in taste and quality which makes it nice that you can expect a good, consistent meal every time."}
{"text":"Terrible chicken ceaser, they made me return it, and buy something else instead of just exchanging. Wow."}
{"text":"Very excited yet another PB that opened and super close it's about time they came out this way! Fire roasted tomato soup and some Paradise pasta I devour the stuff!! Dont hate...appreciate! The cookies and bread are good yumgasm's alone. Who wants to come with me next time!?!?!"}
{"text":"Always a Good Choice 

Paradise Bakery has always been a great  place to grab a quick bite to eat.  The food is delicious, fresh,  and Paradise has so many diffrent options. 

The salads and sandwiches are tasty.  My nephew enjoys the Macaroni & Cheese and so do I.  The macaroni & chrese is creamy and taste as if it was home cooked.  The soups and salads are equally delicious.

 We always end our meal with a sweet treat and Paradise has some of the best after meal treats.  The baked goods are the best!! You won't be able to choose.

 This staff at Paradise are always friendly and  eager to accommodate your needs."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery is not always at the top of my mind when picking places to eat. But, when I happen to be driving by or fellow lunch mates choose, it is always a great option.

Everything is pretty much freshly made. The salad options are almost endless. They are constantly changing up the seasonal specials - so there is always something new to try. Pair any of the salads with Jalapeño Corn Bread - and you have a winning combination!

TIP: This one - being in a retirement town - fills up quickly with the older crowd at lunch and EARLY dinner. So expect a long line - but a short wait as the staff always handles the rushes well."}
{"text":"I usually compare Paradise Bakery  to Panera...and rightly so. Panera has purchased 51% of the company and is slowly changing it over to their type of bakery. 

 What I enjoy about the Paradise Bakery  is the easy way the restaurant is set up. There is a cafeteria line around the outside of the place which made it easy to select and order items in a logical fashion.

The food from the Paradise is always fresh and made to order. You even get a free chocolate chip cookie with some meals and the cookies are delicious. I think Paradise Bakery is a little on the pricey side as compared to similar shops however, the food is always good.

You can't go wrong with the Paradise."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing cookies of course!  Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Salads, soups, sandwiches, and cookies with a nice assembly-line-type set-up.  You do get a cookie with each meal, it's large and it's clean.  They have breakfast in the morning.

This just isn't my favorite place to eat - nothing is terrible, but the ingredients are pretty blah and the resulting meals are, as well.  On top of all that, they're not at all inexpensive for what you get, and the service is as bland as the food.  

I only eat here when there are no other options."}
{"text":"It's what you would expect.  A good turkey sandwich, side salad, and a cookie.  Not rocket science.  It's clean and pretty fast.  A convenient place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"This is a review of the giant cookie. I ordered one recently (snickerdoodle), and it wasn't very good. The cookie seemed like it had too much flour in it. Very doughy (not raw-doughy, too much flour doughy). As a result it was also pretty dry.

And they never asked about color for the icing design. I should have thought of it myself, so I have to take some of the blame. They picked a ridiculous color combination (red and zinc chromatic green) for me.  For an order like this they take your phone number, but they never called me to say \"hey, you didn't specify a color\".

I don't think I'll be ordering one from here again.  I had better luck last time at the Paradise at San Tan Village."}
{"text":"First time @ this Paradise Bakery location & it will be my last! It was not busy me & my sister were the first ones to stand in line. After we placed our order & paid then the crowd started to roll in. Ridiculously slow service just to make 2 sandwiches. I mean come on REALLY!!! Our order was finally finished until the employee started to pick up trash off the ground before handing me our food! What ever happened to good costumer service??? My sandwich was not even good, dry with no spread & they messed up my sisters order. Horrible service & work ethic."}
{"text":"A little on the pricey side for sandwiches, but the food is fresh and the atmosphere is comfortable and clean."}
{"text":"When this location opened, I went BANANAS!
I love, love, love PB. I am learning to accept the merge with Panera. I came from Panera-ville originally to PARADISE (bakery)-land, and I liked that I had my \"back home place\" and \"new home\" place.
I've probably eaten the chicken walnut salad 30 times from this location. (well over 200 times cumulatively). Never fails to wow my palate. Perfect amount of chicken, never drowning in mayo, lovely crunchy walnuts. Gets even crazier (nuttier?) if you get it on a croissant instead. 
The new turkey with avocado sandwich is also fantastic. And it's a real avocado, not that nasty preservative filled gross green paste other places try to charge you $2 for. Also love the chicken chopped cobb salad with avocado, hold the piggie (bacon).
Caesar salad is easily one of my favorites. Lettuce is always fresh, and the dressing is so tasty! You are welcome to make your own salad if you don't want one of their suggestions. Just let them know.
Lemon chicken orzo soup=good enough to eat even on a hot day!
Fire roasted tomato soup is another favorite, never too acidic or salty, and that's hard to manage 100% of the time, but somehow, they do.
Mac n cheese for kids (or kids at heart.....ok now my pants aren't fitting again...)

I miss their Strawberry Peach decaf iced  tea (yes, I'm a veteran customer), but I like the new Mango and Acai iced teas.


The free cookies with sandwich are downright evil. I can't resist their soft, chewy goodness. Darn you, cookies! (You can get something besides chocolate chip if you ask)
I also come for breakfast and get either a muffin (the free ones rack up quickly with their Taste of Paradise card) or an egg sandwich. Power sandwich or steak and egg on a bagel is muy, muy delicioso! Fresh squeezed orange juice, fresh fruit, black cherry smoothie. Okay, I've had every breakfast item they have. No complaints. Republic of Tea hot tea!

i don't have enough time to write about all their menu items, because I pretty much have tried everything! But I will say that the only thing I don't prefer is the new tuna salad, compliments of Panera. It's just okay, not wowza like most things.

ANd please bring the green iced tea from Panera over! Hot diggity, it was like nothing else. 

Okay, it's not cheap, but again, you get what you pay for. It's not subway!

I come here at least once a week!!"}
{"text":"This location is a bit bigger than some other locations, offering free wifi as usual.
It's always crowded during lunch but never a long wait and never a sacrifice on quality.
I get the chicken walnut salad of course, or sometimes the new turkey with avocado sandwich, and the chicken chopped cobb salad.
It's been open longer than a year I think, and still looks brand new. Kept up very well.
I haven't experienced them running out of anything at lunch, although I have only come during dinner hours a few times. Always during the week."}
{"text":"Everything is so bland and over priced. This place is only OK for a salad or the baked goods. Skip on the food.. Especially if your a foodie like I am... You'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"I love their food but the set up is ridiculous. It takes forever to get through the line and there's lots of people asking for you order over and over again. They need to visit a Panera Bread and take a hint on how to set up service."}
{"text":"GRRRRREAT!

I am a  big fan of the Turkey Cranberry Sandwich here... it is always so fresh and tasty.... 

Fair Prices
Good Service
Good Food......

Give them a taste!"}
{"text":"Stupidly slow service, everyone here is just chatting it up and taking their time putting together orders. Prices are reasonable and their organic strawberry lemonade is good. Won't be coming back though."}
{"text":"West coast's Panera Bread!  What's NOT to lve!"}
{"text":"Lots of great sandwich and salad selections. Baked goods selection is superb with a free chocolate chip cookie coming with all sandwiches. FYI if you ask they'll switch your chocolate chip
Cookie for another variety."}
{"text":"While the food was decent and space clean; the prices are a bit up there. Two of us has a VERY modest lunch ringing in at $19 and change.
The service on the other hand was absolute crap. Having never been before and stating that to the staff, they all looked as though we had insulted their families and provided no direction to the flow of the restaurant. Only after asking explicitly \"where/when we pay\" and \"how do we get our food\" were we given any answers."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for the first time at this location. It's right around the corner from where I live and I'm in heaven. I got a wonderful Cobb Chicken salad and I couldn't ask for more. Wonderful service and great atmosphere. The Decor of the place is great and relaxing. Great place for dinner or lunch and even breakfast for coffee etc."}
{"text":"Dreadful.  Croutons and rolls were stale.  So bad I asked for a refund and went somewhere else.  I have eaten here many times in the past as is close to my house. Was always ok.  What happened?  How do you screw up a salad this much?"}
{"text":"If I could leave a negative amount of stars I absolutely would. This place is horrible! The little girls that run the place in the mornings are rude and I think, brain damaged. If that's true I'm sorry but there was 9 people standing around doing NOTHING! When I asked if they had anybody working they acted like I had something coming out of my forehead. I recommend going anywhere but here! Yelp is a great resource and if you tell it what you want it will tell you somewhere better than this! Support local business!!!"}
{"text":"The steak and white cheese sandwich is my go to. I am not a giant fan of this place but not for any other reason than I do not like paying for sandwiches and soups, but the wife loves it so we go here. Happy wife happy life."}
{"text":"Can you give half a star? Ordered the club sandwich and it was awesome for the first several bites and then I found hairs in my mouth:/ not so bueno. I called the store manager and explained the situation and she said she had no idea why anyone would pull out 3 hairs from their head and place them in a sandwich. I said Hey! I'm pretty sure the hair fell off their head when they were making the sandwich. The manager said so it was 3 hairs? I said I wasn't counting the exact amount of hairs that made up the blop that I pulled out of my mouth. She said she could offer me a free sandwich to make up for my experience. At this point I thought I was being punked, I started looking around for Aston Kutcher . I said I'm not calling for free food, I'm calling for the next person so they don't go through that experience and you're welcome. The manager was clueless and I was really frustrated that she wouldn't listen to me. 
So buyers note to self, this is not the type of dental floss we want for ourselves, beware of hairnet-less."}
{"text":"This Paradise Bakery is the worst I have ever been to. I have been here 3 times now hoping it will get better and it never does. They have awful customer service. I went with my husband at 7 pm and they had run out of 2 soups and bread plus the dinner rolls. We were 2 of 5 people in the whole place and it took about 20 minutes to get our food. When they served us, a young man said they were out of dinner rolls but would like to bring us another type of bread. We told him what we wanted and he completely forgot and never brought anything out. Meanwhile he sat and chatted with friends. 
The food was bland. The only good thing was the cookies which are always amazing.
Customer service was awful. Expect to wait and not be helped until the employees are done with their personal conversations."}
{"text":"I walked in preparing to order breakfast. Not keeping track of time, the young lady Tallin informed me  they stopped serving  breakfast 30 minutes ago. After seeing my sad face she said \"let me see what I can do\" and asked me what I want. They took care without an issue. AWESOME!!!! All the employees were happy, joking around, with smiles, all while taking care of customer. OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!"}
{"text":"I arrived in the mid afternoon when it was dead but had a lot of employees.  I started at the sandwich station and no one was there.  They looked at me and walked off as I went down the line.  The manager saw me arriving at the cashier with no order and asked what I wanted, so we went back to the beginning.  I got my order in and sat and waited.  I realized again there were no employees behind the counter but my sandwich was there.  My ten dollar sandwich was made then set by the trash.  Two different employees chucked things into the trash (three times) and cleared my sandwich, but had to have seen it plainly.  They need to instill in their employees that when people pay ten bucks for a sandwich they should act like they care."}
{"text":"Food is not very tasty, the you pick 2 combo is misleading as it does not make any discount but simply adding up the prices of the two items in the combo."}
{"text":"Management changed recently and is evident in customer service and customer relations. Portion sizes seem to be shrinking. Not worth the money.  I don't care how good the cookies are!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Paradise Bakery for years and with each visit they have progressively gotten worse. 

I went there is morning hoping for a nice cup of coffee and breakfast sandwich and was thoroughly disappointed. 

The coffee was bitter and the sandwich was horrible! I ordered the power sandwich, the turkey sausage and spinach. There was barely any turkey on it, the spinach was piled up on one side, it was luke warm. On top of it all it didn't even taste very good."}
{"text":"Paradise bakery is good food a little bit over priced but good food.  Very good service and friendly people. . Behind the counters....A must do is try their cookies. .best cookies"}
{"text":"Was so-so on this day. Ordered the split Mac and Cheese and Chicken Tortellini Alfredo, French Onion soup and a frozen lemonade.

It was lunch time and about half the tables were open. Usually not a problem but half of those weren't cleared. There wasn't a staff person in sight clearing tables with peak lunch hour approaching. French Onion soup was warm, but not hot. The Mac n Cheese and Tortellini when it arrived was barely warm. Flavor was okay and the Tortellini was very good...even cold. They didn't bring my drink which necessitated a trip back to the register where it wasn't even made. Had to wait for that to be made.

They just seemed overwhelmed this day. Maybe they didn't have a full staff but sending out food less then a perfect temperature is unacceptable."}
{"text":"been a customer of paradise for years. love the food the used to have, but with menu changes and changes in how the lines and ordering process works, it just plain sucks now. I heard they were merging with Panera, which is also great in its own right, but that doesn't make any sense for why the food is outrageously priced and the ordering just doesn't work. super lame. won't be back until they figure it out."}
{"text":"I watched the sandwich maker use the mustard and mayo packets to smear the condiments into the sandwich instead of a knife..... Pretty gross.
I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is now known as Panera bread .. I work right across the street and our office loved to eat here when it was Paradise Bakery, the food was better and the staff was a lot more helpful and nice.We do not go to have lunch here anymore now that it has changed and now my husband told me he tried to place a pick up order recently and was rudely told he could no longer do this and all orders would need to be made online.. well we will just go across the street to the new Kneaders restaurant.. Better service and food!.. hopefully there will still be some Paradise Bakery restaurants throughout the valley"}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery is awesome and provided you like sandwiches, soup or salad you can get something you'll love. If I want to get something healthy I will get a classic salad with chicken, corn, pecans and corn/bean mix. If I don't care that day I'll get a 1/2 sandwich and tomato soup. I don't like tomatoes but it tastes like Spagettios.

Plus sandwiches come with a free cookie. Ask for no cookie then get any cookie (instead of chocolate chip) you want.

I have never had anything I didn't love, the selection is great and the iced teas are awesome."}
{"text":"I've been a fan for over ten years but the menu has changed and a lot of my favorites are no longer options. The salad menu is sparse. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad today. Decent portion but the dressing had an overwhelming flavor of mayonnaise, which was unappetizing."}
{"text":"I can't help but compare this place to Panera! I know they get alot of their ingredients from them and they have a lot of the same menu items!

The restaurant itself is very big and inviting! Perfect place to have lunch with a friend. The staff is sooooo friendly! Great customer service.

I ordered the roasted turkey avocado blt on sea salt focaccia which is what i always get from Panera, compared to Panera's though, it didn't taste AS good for some reason. Still good though. All sandwhiches come with a free cookie, which is cool but I like how you can get chips at Panera (their sea salt kettle cooked chips are excellent!). I got a chocolate chip macadamia cookie, it was pretty good.

Overall I would come back, because it's in the area and the nearest Panera is 20 mins from me. I prefer Panera, but this is a good alternative!"}
{"text":"Bad service got my lunch for free soup was cold waited 20 mins for a turkey sandwhich."}
{"text":"The soups, sandwiches, baked goodies, and salads are always great!  Comfort food...  Need to try their breakfast menu one day!"}
{"text":"BUSY BUSY BUSY Place!  It is the same as all the PB.  Clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"We don't live in Arizona, so having our relatives take us here was aaawesome!  The place was great.  So great that we went back like two more times during our stay in Arizona.  LoL  One of the first things we did was google to see if there were locations in San Diego...we found one in El Cajon.  We have not been to that one yet, but it is in the plans at some point.  The food was fresh, portions were great, and was not overly pricey by any means.  Reminded us of a Panera....which come to find out it is a sister company of sorts.  Great food here."}
{"text":"Why does it seem like the employees here hate their own life. Honestly speaking I have never in my life experienced such a negative atmosphere from the people working here. Ages 18-27 that work here and when you walk into the restaurant you have to greed them. 

I will not be coming back to a place that feels so dead and not in the mood to work. 0/10 stars for service and quality of food."}
{"text":"Found my back-up to my fave today--my fave sandwich that is.  I earned a freebie meal after coming umpteen times.  I strayed out of my comfort zone for a hot Cuban, panini sandwich for takeout to work for lunch.  This sandwich was great.  It will never displace my chicken walnut but, its nice to have a stand in in case the chicken walnut needs a break.  Service here is always friendly strong and consistent."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in Arizona I stop in Paradise Bakery because they have a few favorite items I like to get. However, they're now crossing their menu with Panera and the quality is not the same. They used to mix your salad in front of you. Now you get it in a box, not mixed together, just like Panera. They've also gotten rid of all the sandwiches I liked, except for the club. I don't understand the transition. If you've been bought out, change the name and menu and call it a day."}
{"text":"Paradise is ok if you aren't looking for something amazing. I can easily make the same quality sandwiches and soups at home. But I like to go out sometimes and have a sandwich somewhere else. Don't get me wrong they beat subway easily but they aren't great by any means. There is a young girl there who is too cool for school but everyone else is super nice. I will always continue to eat there, but not with high expections."}
{"text":"This place may have new management. Service is slow, they are out of forks! Og and several of the sodas are out. Mention it to them and are told they will get right on that, still waiting. I used to love the roast beef bit I guess it lost out to one of the newer chickens. We don't all want to eat healthy, a good rare roast beef now amd then would be nice. Not sure I will come back...paneri here I come."}
{"text":"I did speak with the manager about this. Twice today (9/18/2015) while coming and then going, I noticed a dog left unattended in a vehicle parked outside this restaurant. I was able to locate one of the dog owners who was very defensive. The manager found the second one. I suggested that they put up a sign at the entrance stating that if children and dogs are left alone unattended in vehicles that they will call the Police and report the license plate number. This may help the situation. I live in the neighborhood and see this quite often; it's very disturbing. The manager said they could not put up such a sign. I think if others request this then it will happen. I am giving them two stars because I enjoy their coffee, but upset about this situation."}
{"text":"So gross. Seriously for a corporate chain this place needs so much work. Fork filthy, and bowls disgusting.. Restaurant 101. Let's learn how to wash our dishes. Song even get me started on the rude in- friendly staff. Ugh, I usually enjoy paradise locations but this one is just too much. Eww. Clean up your act tempe location"}
{"text":"This place is pathetic. I stopped here last week and the customer service was nonexistent. No one available to check me out. Like a fool I gave them another chance. Stopped by to get iced tea to go. Stood at the register... and stood and stood and stood. Finally some gal hollers at me, \"Do you want something?\" in a most unfriendly tone. \"Um, yes I'd like iced tea\". Response: \" Well that register's not open \". Period. Walks away. So I left and went to Starbucks. Ironically I had just come from a conference where the speaker told us to never, ever cater to a business that does not want you business. OK. I get it now."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and just happened to stop by this place after a baseball game in the afternoon to soak up some air conditioning and let me tell you.... the food in this place is awesome. Very tasty and perfect portions. Definitely stopping by here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The 'You Pick 2' is the answer to my indecision!

It's just too difficult to pick between my 2 favorites, the turkey and cranberry sandwich & the chicken BBQ salad. The combination of 1/2 servings of each makes for the perfect amount of food so that I'm not starving within the hour AND I'm also not wishing I'd worn elastic waist pants, lol. The fact it also comes with a cookie (chocolate chip unless you ask for something else) doesn't hurt ;)

On the rare occasion that I stop by during breakfast I do favor the mandarin orange muffin. It pares perfectly with coffee!

The servers here are always so nice and patient.
The place always looks packed, it makes me wonder if anyone ever goes to work, lol. It's not an issue because both their parking lot and the dining area are big. The only issue is the line you'll need to stand in if you visit during their busier hours. Still, well worth it!"}
{"text":"This location is inside of the mall food court. Given its location it usually has a line no matter what time of day, but they move through it quickly and efficiently. This last visit I decided to have a half order of the Greek Salad with Chicken. I waited a few minutes, and they whipped it up fresh and it was boxed up in a container you could either eat out of immediately or take away for later. 

I've had their cookies on other visits, and they are always fresh and tasty.  The service at this one is consistent and they are always moving with a sense of urgency, so if you're in a hurry, don't be deterred by a line here.  

Overall: A
A good food court option!"}
{"text":"Love the food here, but is not easy to pick up at all. A lot of time when I try to pick up lunch for my office I will call and get a busy signal several times. One time when this happened I decided to just go through the line and order for everyone. When I was ordering the sandwiches I mentioned to the guy taking my order (he looked like a manager, was wearing business clothes) that I tried calling a few times and kept getting a busy signal, and I just wanted to let him know. I wasn't looking for him to do anything, just a simple \"oh thank you for letting us know\" would have been nice. Instead he said \"well, we're really busy\", and that was it. It also is not a very good value for the food that you get and they have messed up our orders a couple of times."}
{"text":"I love Paradise Bakery, especially the artichoke panini and the fire roasted tomato soup.  Plus, any place that just gives you a cookie with your meal will always get my stamp of approval.

Atmosphere and food are great but most of the times during lunch at this particular location, the place turns into a bit of a daycare.  So if you're looking for a quiet atmosphere away from kids, this might not be the place for lunch."}
{"text":"The food has always been good [enough], but the service has always been so-so of the many times I've been here. The minimal required sense of friendliness & urgency to help customers for the sake of keeping their doors open I imagine. Luckily the only reason I continue to come is because I like the food and it's close to my house but I would like to see them do better in the customer service department."}
{"text":"Food is always great. 3 stars due to your new ordering system in store. Takes longer, staff seems to be working less efficiently. In the end it took more 20 min to order a to go salad with only 3 people in front of me in line.
Raised my concern about the ordering system with the staff. Their response: \"It is what it is.\" 
Indeed."}
{"text":"It's been years since I last tried Paradise Bakery, so today I decided to give it a try again, which as it turns out was not a good idea.  When I arrived I noticed that they had a 2for? special so I thought I would give it a try.  The nice girl at one of the counters took my order for a Turkey Panini, and the line moved me along so I ordered a small soup.  The total around $9 for a half sandwich and soup, which is a bit high, though not horrible as long as there is some value.  Unfortunately I ordered for take out so I did not notice until I got back that the nearly $5 half sandwich was pathetic.  The sandwich consisted of  rubbery turnkey, cheese and panini sauce - I thought it would at least have lettuce or something (they never asked if I wanted anything on it).  Really disappointed that they did not even ask if I wanted anything on the sandwich since it would have at least improved the taste.  The turkey was not even as good as the Pepperidge Farms sliced turkey I buy in the store, it seemed to be similar to Subway's turkey.  The cookie was good however, and the soup was OK.  

There are much better places to get a good sandwich for a similar price (Dillys Deli, Jasons, even Wildflower). Needless to say I won't be going back to \"Paradise\"."}
{"text":"Wow we just had lunch at Paradise Bakery today and the service was great but the place was really messy. There are 5 of us and we could not get a booth due to all the booths were occupied or the tables were left a mess. More messy tables than occupied tables! 
We were a bit surprised by this and will likely be passing up lunch at Paradise Bakery in the future. This is not a great experience as I am wondering how everything else is being maintained???"}
{"text":"Awesome food and prices this place is good place to eat at and tomato soup is yummy and good"}
{"text":"I will start by saying i eat at Paradise all the time, I'm over 80 visits on my rewards card. The location at the San Tan mall is the best in the east valley. Service is consistent and friendly. I love the pumpkin muffin and quiche muffin for breakfast. For lunch the Southwest Caesar is a must and the southwest chicken is the best sandwich, except they have made it a seasonal item, and it is not currently on the menu. The other sandwiches are solid and the best part is you can get everything made to order the way you like it. Add as many veggies to your salad as you want, at no charge. Great place for an early lunch, I go in at 9 or 10 am all the time. Ice tea is also great, go 50/50 on the regular and mango breeze!"}
{"text":"I used to love Paradise Bakery...

...and then Panera bought them. 

They have gotten rid of the two things I LOVED there - the Chipotle Turkey Wrap and the BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad. It's probably just my bad luck that those were two of my favorite items, but it's still disheartening. 

The service at this location is not good and the prices have increased. Sadly, I don't think I'll ever be returning to Paradise Bakery."}
{"text":"Food was good.  I always order the tomato soup and a half salad.  This location seems to be a bit slow than other ones that I have been to.  

It's in a good location at the San Tan Village Mall, so there is plenty of other activities to do after grabbing a bite to eat."}
{"text":"This place is like Disneyland... Wait in a really long line, pay lots of money and get a great but small payoff."}
{"text":"My Stars are based on Two Things Only!

The Quiche Pie and the Chocolate Chip Cookies! Especially when you go early and they are coming out of the oven! MMMMMM!

Breakfast of Champions!

{"text":"Went here for breakfast. I love this place. I do not have one at home. My friend and I each got a breakfast sandwich. They were super fresh as they were too hot to eat for a few minutes.

I also got 2 cookies and I got tea. I love that they have 3 fresh brewed kinds!"}
{"text":"Don't ask for the fans to be turned off (even if it's only 60 degrees out) unless you want a rude reply... (Thanks Cathy.)  Paradise, you're going downhill 

Also, I always ask for a vegetarian salad and they always say, you can just order it without the meat. As a vegetarian, why pay for meat when I'm not getting it?  Seriously!"}
{"text":"If you like overpriced food in tiny portions, this is the place for you. We had never been here before today, and we won't be back. We had the bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and was so disappointed when it was delivered. It wasn't a sandwich at all. It was more like a small appetizer that cost almost $12.00."}
{"text":"First time and last time customer at this location. We rushed in today hoping to get a breakfast sandwich before they stop serving at 11:00 (which, on a Sunday I think is a little harsh!). We got in there at 10:53, phew, we made it..walk to the counter..nope. The worker looks to her left as another worker shakes his head to her and says something which I later found out was \"no more breakfast.\" So we start to place our order, with SEVEN minutes to go before cut off time....and the worker says \"we aren't serving breakfast anymore.\" We were angry and asked why, to which she replied \"manager's orders.\" So then we asked if we could at least get a bagel and she said she had to go ask her manager!! We left. 10:53 is not 11:00. How hard is it to make the breakfast stuff anyway?! It's all the same microwaved crap."}
{"text":"The bread they give you that's included with the soup on the side, my girlfriend and I both had our own. She asked me why I didn't eat mine. I said \"it smells like dog\" while eating my soup. She sniffed hers and made a disgusted face. Nasty!!! Idk if their bread has been sitting out or whatever the case may be but it smells gross and tastes gross. This happened to me the last time too. The broccoli soup is good. I'm nervous for us to try the 2 cookies I bought today. Ugh. I will never go back if these cookies are nasty too."}
{"text":"Despite multiple bad or questionable reviews.

I've been here multiple times and have been pleased with the service and food.

I usually get the Mediterranean veggie sandwich and classic salad.  Today I ordered roasted tomato and mozzarella panini and it was delicious!

My only complaint about paradise bakery is price, but I know the prices and order here anyway.

My visits are always on weekends."}
{"text":"Paradise is one of my favorite spots for a quick bite. I love almost everything on their menu, which is mostly sandwiches, salads, and soups. They also have a bakery counter, which serves all sorts of goodies (brownies, pastries, cookies, parfaits, etc). But, as a special treat, when you order a sandwich, you get a free chocolate chip cookie on the side. 

This location is in SanTan Mall (if you enter off Williams Field Rd, turn in at the light and head straight back- it will be on your right about a block into the mall). Parking is somewhat difficult, as it is located on the outskirts of a mall, but if you have other shopping to do, it makes it convenient."}
{"text":"The cashier is too busy giving out Instagram advice to take orders and when I do finally order it takes 20 minutes to make 2 pb &j kids meals.. They had 6 employees leaning on counters and not helping. I'd rather go to wildflower downstairs or cafe zupas across the street next time for sure."}
{"text":"Tomato soup is absolutely wonderful. Creamy, not to think some small chunks but not huge. Great flavor. the grilled cheese was a bit lacking in the cheese department. The thick slices of bread over shadow the 2 slices of cheese they give you."}
{"text":"This place has been going down hill for a few years now. Used to be good awhile back, now everything is always being changed around, things that were once on the me u aren't anymore and the staff was super rude the last time I came in. Step your game up paradise"}
{"text":"Horrific service.  Chimpanzees could make a sandwich and ring me up quicker."}
{"text":"I am generally a huge fan of Paradise Bakery, but my last visit was a bust! 

I went here with my sis for lunch a week ago. I ordered the creamy chicken and wild rice soup, it was spectacular! I also had a half a ham & Brie panini, I have had this sandwich before and it has always been great, but on this day it was down right terrible. I took two bites and that was all I could muster. Seriously don't know what went wrong but this was not a good sandwich. 

As far as service goes, the place was slammed but the line went quick and the food came out rather quickly as well."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakeries going downhill. 
Each of the 4 locations that I have visited in the Phoenix area seem to be lowering their standards recently. Fewer personnel, less attention to customers, out of muffins at 7:10 in the morning, no coffee.  Seems like a regional management thing."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for breakfast while we waited for the mall to open.  The prices are reasonable and lunch is always tasty, so why not?

I was shocked at the level of service we received. We weren't greeted, and we were simply stared at while we looked over our options. My husband, who is a diabetic, asked if they offered a sugar free option of their pumpkin spice latte. Instead of a simple No, or even an alternate recommendation, he received a lecture about how they would never offer such a thing at a organic restaurant. It was rude and condescending, and frankly unnecessary.

We will no longer visit this restaurant to be treated this way."}
{"text":"Food was good but the tempo is at a crawl. The efficiency is low and urgency is nonexistent ... 
I think the one on pebble creek is wayyyyy better !"}
{"text":"This location is now a Panera. I have not been to Panera in 6months or so. They have changed and it is better. I had the strawberry poppy seed salad and half of a Turkey Avacado blt. It is very good. 

I will start coming back to panera. I stopped going because at several locations the food quality and menu had gone downhill. If this location is any Indiction I will start trying them again."}
{"text":"I had a great sandwich for a reasonable price.  The cookies were great.  If you looking for a quick meal fix.  This might just be the ticket for you."}
{"text":"I love paradise/Panera's food so I frequent this location a lot. My only complaint is the service at this one can either be great or terrible depending on who's working. There's a girl named Alyssa (I believe- she appears to be Asian) who is consistently rude. She has an impatient energy and cuts you off when you're speaking and grabs your card from your hand in an aggressive way. Once I started to tell her what salad I got and she cut me off mid-sentence by saying \"yeah did you want a drink.\" I resumed my sentence and she did it again! I never have issues with servers or the like, but this girl pisses me off everytime I'm in there. There's a new girl though who seems very sweet and eager to help customers. My suggestion would be for management to tighten up on their employees and watch them closer for how they interact with customers."}
{"text":"First of all, it happend like 1 hour ago. I went to the shop to buy fresh cookies, but the cookies were not fresh (it may be due to the timing, but I am not complaining). However, I got very bad customer service. I first accidentally asked for suger cookies, but I wanted the one beside it. The girl was taking it out and at the same time talking with two other customers and her colleagues. I tried to bring her attention towards me but she got upset with it. I asked her what kind of cookies are those. She answered very rudely. I bought the cookies, she put them in a box and slided the box towards me on the counter. It was very rude. But she was talking with others properly. I felt it was may be due to my skin/ethnicity. I am never going back there."}
{"text":"What do you do when you order one thing and bring home something different?
The Pick 2 Combo of an Adult Grilled Cheese came home looking like a plain grilled cheese.
It is 830 when I walked in and they don't close until 9 p.m.  You would've thought it was 855 p.m. cuz they had everything put away and was working hard on clearing the rest.
She couldn't even find the cookies that go with the sandwich orders.
Yeah um, don't come into a restaurant to order food during business hours."}
{"text":"Had a lunch date here.  I was pleasantly surprised.  But get here early!  By noon the line was nearly out the door.  I went with the chicken and pasta.  I was surprised how good it was.  Portion was good and I got a cookie."}
{"text":"Ah Paradise Bakery, how you make my tummy full with all your delicious treats!

Love this place. Relaxed but vibrant atmosphere, excellent selection of sweets and savories, and great customer service, from the order taker through to the gentleman that cleans your table (what a character!). I don't believe Surprise has gotten into the habit of celebrating excellence, so I'll make a start here. This place does great food, has great staff, and cookies that will make you have to buy a gym subscription if you're not careful how many you eat! :)"}
{"text":"Really good taste but the service is so slow, they drop my sandwich and forgot to do it again a lot of people where waiting for their food its just not organized."}
{"text":"I could not think of a place to go to lunch so I saw Paradise Bakery and said to myself I have not been here for years let's eat healthy.  The line was 13 or so people deep so I waited and saw what I wanted I ordered the you pick two half of a sandwich and a cup of the Fire roasted tomato soup. The way they run this place is like herding cattle with not directions it's a cluster F. The best part of the meal was the cookie and the pretty girl I spoke with in the line we had both not been here for about two years and both said we could see why.  I will be back to buy cookies there they do have killer cookies that's about it."}
{"text":"Summary:
Food: Incredible Oatmeal cookies/Good Black Bean Soup/ Blah salads and onion soup
Beverage Selection: Caffeine Free Diet Coke (great!)
Service: Spotty. Today's prompt me to write review. (more below)
_____________________________________________________________
After signing up to Yelp, I have found myself wondering what great restaurant would be my first review.  It seems that Paradise Bakery, and my not so positive experience, will be the first of what I hope are many reviews.  

Why would Paradise Bakery not charge $.25 for an individual chipper escapes me.  I don't want to buy (eat) 6 chippers. I just want to (should) buy 1.  Normally, I am offered a complimentary chipper when I offer to buy one.  \"Oh no... have it on us\" is the typical response.  

Today, however, the courteous girl behind the counter explained she could not sell one to me and she could not give one to me either.  

Frankly, this makes no sense.  I would more than willingly spend $.25 on a chipper yet Paradise will not take my money or sell me their product."}
{"text":"Always have to drop a note about Paradise Bakery - simply one of my ALL TIME FAV. places to go.  If you have never tried, then you must go.  I love everything they have.  soups, salads, sandwiches, COOKIES .... YUM

Took some pics this time, and it was packed ... even at off lunch hours!  Crazy!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to AZ and I was bummed to find out that they didn't have a Panera in this state. My boyfriend then told me about Paradise Bakery and I was pleased to find  out it was owned by Panera Bread and basically the same thing! 

When we walked in my first impression was that it was very clean, everyone was really friendly and they had great music playing in the background. They also had a lot of selection to choose from!

I ended up getting the Tomato & Mozzarella panini and my boyfriend got the Fontega Chicken panini with soup. Everything was so fresh and delicious. Plus both came with a Chocolate Chip cookie that was seriously to die for. 

If you ever want a tasty sandwich/soup/salad I would definitely hit up Paradise!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for my lunch break the other day because I wanted something some kind of semblance of being healthy.  Decided to go with the half sandwich and cup of soup meal so went up to the line to order.  The girl working didn't really smile when she acknowledged me and seemed a little bored.  The next guy to help me at the salad and soup station actually was very friendly so it made up for the first girl.  He gave recommendations on things and let me try a couple of the soups when I couldn't decide.

The food itself wasn't great.  I liked the clam chowder, it wasn't mind blowing by any stretch of the imagination but it was good for being ordered in the middle of a desert, the Club Sandwich just tasted weird.  I wish I could describe it better but really it was just a strange flavor, I didn't even finish the half sandwich.  The meal came with a chocolate chip cookie too which of course was great but I really was disappointed with the sandwich.  Guess I'll just have to make sure to pass on the club next time."}
{"text":"I previously worked at Paradise Bakery for 3 years so I know how everything is supposed to run, the past 2 times I have been there I have been extremely displeased with the lack of urgency to get my meal to me so I can get to work.

The most recent was my most upsetting experience. 
Arrived to PB at 8:30 hoping to get to work by 8:50 (I work walking distance from paradise), no one was in line in front of me nor  behind me. I ordered a sausage, egg and cheese on a bagel and calmly sat down to wait for my to go items. I watched my ticket come out of the expo machine and at the sandwich station (which is where the expo machine is). At the sandwich bar stud a girl bagging cookies and another standing next to her talking.
Now to make my food, you take pre cooked egg, sausage and a piece of cheese, put it on a bagel and throw it on the presser. Not rocket science. 

After about 12 minutes I finally got up and asked one of the register girls to please ask the girl bagging cookies to check the expo machine for my ticket. 
She walked over, whispered in her ear, both girls stared at my like I was asking way to much. The girl bagging cookies walked to the expo machine, pulled the ticket, looked at me and smiled and went back to bagging cookies. 

Finally the sandwich maker came out of the back with stuff from the walk in and made my sandwich. I got to work with 1 minute to spare before I opened. 

1. Girls like that will never progress in any industry because they have poor attitudes and have the \"its not my job demeanor\".
2. The food was not that hard to make and if they had attempted, things like that put you in the running for cross training.
3. IF YOU CANT MAKE IT GO GET THE EFFING SANDWHICH MAKER!!!!

probably wont come back. Too mad."}
{"text":"Went up tonight - so confusing.   Line is closed,  everything is changed but no one says anything.   We finally ask and are told they're changing to Panera.  So sad - Pantera menu is much more limited.  I'm vegetarian and no good choices.  When someone finally comes to take order,  old menu still being used so we order and pay - then they don't have this and that but can make do with other things.    Never mind - we canceled.   So sad -was a regular so for us - guess not any more!"}
{"text":"I just recently found out that Panera Bread acquired Paradise Bakery and Cafe. I'm a fan of Panera Bread so this place was definitely something to look forward to during my travels in Arizona. Sandwich and salad was bomb (as usual) and cost a little above $10 with the \"You Pick 2\" option. Overall I would come back here again. Never can go wrong!"}
{"text":"Try the Southwest Chicken salad!"}
{"text":"I used love this place when it was Paradise Bakery. Now it sucks! It's more expensive. It doesn't taste the same!"}
{"text":"The food here is always good, and consistent. I like the selection, and I like the different teas.

I don't mind paying 10 bucks for a meal from here, as it seems to be good value. I like the half sandwich/salad combo.

The reason for three stars is because of the service.

60% of the time I am there I have to tell the employee how to make my salad. They always forget something. If I want to omit something from the salad, I usually have to say so twice, the first time they never get it. They have also stopped asking if you want the dressing mixed in, so if you like it that way be prepared to request it.

There seems to be a decent turnover at the place, so that probably explains the trouble with remembering what goes into the salads.

I went there for dinner today, and I understand it was a Holiday. They were not particularly busy.

All the employees were standing at one end of the counter talking. This was not an issue right away as they took my sandwich order.

I then proceeded to the salad area, and had to wait as the salad guy (wearing someone else's nametag, as I doubt his name was \"Jennay\") wandered over. I had to repeat my no onions request twice, and request mixed in dressing (like usual.)

 He seemed confused about what went into the salad (like usual) and did not seem too happy I interrupted his conversation with the co-workers.

I then was at the register, and had to wait for the cashier to come from the back. None of the employees at the counter felt the urge to go let her know I was there waiting to pay.

It wasn't horrible, but it was slightly frustrating. Hopefully they can get the small issues resolved."}
{"text":"A better version of Panera bread! Lots of menu options and the line, which was awfully long, goes by fast. I love cafes, and this one does not disappoint. Paradise offers free refills on yummy iced teas and coffees, healthy choices, and a free cookie that comes with your sandwich! Every server was extremely nice, and even the customers who dine here were nice every time we came (which was literally four times within two days). I wish there was a Paradise near me."}
{"text":"My wife and I went your store in Surprise,  AZ tonight on bell rd. We waited for over 15 minutes for someone to take our order but no one did. There were 3 employees up front and all saw us and just ignored us. We finally walked out and went somewhere else to eat. Seems like your company has been going down hill for a while now. Gets worse and worse every time we go."}
{"text":"Large open area to sit and have your lunch. But just ordering your food seems like a hassle.  The time that I went to have lunch there was not a friendly face to help.  My friend was in the middle of ordering her sandwich by maybe someone that did not know what was on the menu then in a split second someone took over and asked to repeat order all over again.  I then proceeded to order and felt like i had to hurry up or else.  I ordered the disgusting new soup and half a dry plain tasteless turkey sandwich just thrown together like they did not care.  There are several cash registers that had someone standing next to them so I just went to the one at the end of the line to pay just to lose my spot and wait in another line to pay with a grouchy old lady.  I wish I did not come here to spend my money or waste my time. My soup which looks good on the mailings that i receive in mail (yakisoba) was bland. I would rather eat paper.  Sorry Paradise Bakery you are not what you used to be years ago when you had delish sandwiches."}
{"text":"Rip off!!! $24 for a couple with two sandwiches, two soups and two drinks. The soup was very salty and tasted like any crap from old country buffet. The sandwiches were equally unspectacular. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. Not sure why this place has such a high rating. Maybe people feeling they are cool for finding an alternative to Panera"}
{"text":"A restaurant chain is only as good as it's weakest link. I've eaten Paradise Bakery foods before, including OK sandwiches, salads, cookies and so on. But my visit to this location was for one thing: a bagel. 

I love bagels, specifically everything bagels. So I ordered one toasted with roasted veggie cream cheese to go. It only took a minute for my order to be ready and I immediately took it out to my car for the drive home. Imagine my surprise when I found out (traveling down the interstate) that the bagel was 1) barely toasted 2) not warm and 3) the cream cheese was in a container for me to spread on myself. 

Of course, being a safe driver, I pull over to a parking lot to put together the bagel that, ordering to go, I thought would be ready-to-eat. The veggie cream cheese had crunchy veggies in it (not as roasted as I would assume), the bagel didn't have much flavor, I had to assemble it myself, and it was cold. 

Remind me why I didn't just go to a grocery store and purchase a bagel and cream cheese for about 1/4 the price? Suggestion: if it's ordered to-go, it should be ready-to-eat. Bagel rant end."}
{"text":"Addicted to Caprese style sandwiches so I wanted to see if Paradise Bakery & Cafe was making such a thing.  Although they do have a specialty sandwich with mozzarella and tomato/basil smoosh, it was a disappointment.  Soups are always great and the mac and cheese is a once in a great while yummy, comfort foody worth it.  Servers are not well trained and just stood around talking to each other while I waited with no line.  Youth is no excuse for neglecting customers.  For fast food Paradise Bakery is a good choice if you are like me and refuse to eat fried, greasy fattening fare the other fast food joints serve, so I take the good with the bad."}
{"text":"Very basic, tasteless food. So disappointed...I realize this isn't Paradise Bakery but they kept many of the same menu items because they were popular. Only problem is Panera change how they prepare those menu items. The tomato soup used to be so good. The added sour cream and tortilla chips really worked well. Now you just get the soup. And it's virtually tasteless. I ordered a half grilled cheese, one side was stone cold bread-not even a hint of \"grilled\". They evidently don't understand the term \"grilled\". It is actually a panini maker being used. The bread is cooked dry-no butter or oil and what appeared to be a single slice of cheese. Again, so disappointing.  The staff while friendly, has no clue about anything. This location has been open long enough that they should be running a little smoother but that was not the case. I first ate at a Panera about 6 years ago in Chicago and since then, their quality has greatly diminished. They seemed to have cheapened out on their product and it's a shame. They did have a good thing at one time. Perhaps they sacrificed quality for quantity."}
{"text":"This location is very busy during the lunch hour, but service is pretty fast so not much of a wait in line. Their menu has changed somewhat but you can still find great choices. I enjoyed the chicken cobb salad."}
{"text":"Traveling for work and this Paradise Bakery was right next to the hotel I was staying at.  Walked over to grab a bite to eat for breakfast.  It is a large space, similar to other Paradise locations, and was clean and inviting.  Overall the staff was friendly enough.

The downside was the wait.  There were two people in line in front of me, and the place was not overly busy.  After placing my order (breakfast sandwich and a coffee), it took a good 15 minutes to get those two items (the server apologized that they had to make more eggs- ran out of eggs at 7:45 AM??). Multiple servers stopped by asking if the food they had in hand was mine (it wasn't!).  As they give you a number plaque to put on your table, they should know what plate goes with what number...seems pretty easy.

Once my sandwich and coffee arrived, the sandwich was good and came out hot.  The coffee was good, but came out lukewarm at best.

Overall the food was tasty, but the service and timeliness has something to be desired..."}
{"text":"I never had been to Paradise Bakery before. I know, you must be thinking which rock I crawled out from. Seriously, I never really had the finances nor the resources to venture out into the \"unknown\". I thank my co-workers who have shown me the \"unknown\".

So, one day we decided to go to this Paradise Bakery that is tucked away in a corner next to a 5 & Diner and in the same building as a barber shop. Now, it doesn't seem all that inviting unless you know that it's there. 

The first visit, I ordered a paradise club, which is really good. I'm a sucker for croissants. I stuck with that sandwich for a while then tried the tuna, the Thai chicken wrap, pasta salad, paradise Greek salad and their fruit salad. They are all very good. However, I'm not a fan of eating cold chicken but I guess you get used to it.

The pro's for this particular place is the food and service. However the cons are the customers. It gets a little pushy and crowded during lunch hour. Some are really impatient and they cross over your comfort zone. Then when it comes to the soda machine they hog the whole area making you and everyone else wait to fill their cups or get a lid and straw for your cup or whatever you are waiting to get. I understand its lunch time but still show some consideration to other customers as well."}
{"text":"Amazing!! And the cookies are the bomb.com, haha. The menu is great and you never get served something old or gross. Everything is fresh to the taste. Great place for any time of the day, breakfast, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Slow. The store wasn't even that busy. My sandwich took 15 minutes to be ready. I can make a sandwich faster at home. One of the workers wasn't very friendly and the other one was deaf. The focaccia bread here is a little underwhelming. Wildflower bread Company has the best I've ever tasted. Maybe they set the bar too high. The roast beef on the sandwich was good so at least they have that going for them. I don't think they need to cake on the mayonnaise on the sandwich but they did. Don't people come here to eat healthy? They do have the best cookies I've ever tasted in my life though. You have to try the snickerdoodle and the gingerbread cookies."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with the Paradise Bakery. I have been to Paradise Bakery several times throughout the year and this was a major disappointment. The Tuna Fish Sandwich which is typically flavorful and delicious was disgusting. I felt there was a very thin layer of tuna fish spread on like a spread of mayo. Even though I spoke with the cashier about this concern, she basically thought that the layer was generous. If I wanted a disappointing Tuna fish Sandwich, I would have gone to Subway (well a least they put an actual scoop of tuna on their sandwich). Anyhow, I do not have much interest in coming back to this restaurant which is too bad because it was one of my favorite. I will be leaving a similar complaint on Yelp (but apparently there are numerous other complaints that already beat me to it). If you can not find anyone else to eat this food, maybe you can donate the product to the puppy store which is also located in the mall area. The dogs might find this product more enjoyable than I did."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Panera Bread.  I had a breakfast sandwich and a frozen caramel coffee and both were very good.  They had some really nice looking muffins and cookies but I didn't indulge."}
{"text":"Probably the last time I'll come to this location . It used to be good but the last few times was awful. Service is rude and slow. They were out of broc cheese soup and panini bread mid afternoon. I just feel like it's gone downhill and I've been a regular customer for years"}
{"text":"Visited restaurant while attending a conference. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Felt right at home with the food. So glad I decided to give it a try. Definitely would visit again and recommend to others. Had enough food to take back to room to eat later. And I didn't feel guilty after eating it."}
{"text":"This is your standard Paradise Bakery. A little over priced but good food, good service, and clean."}
{"text":"Nice place to sit and check mail on your laptop with a muffin and some tea.  Lemon Poppyseed was awesome and the Chai Latte hit all the right notes.  Will be back for sure!!  Look forward trying some of the sandwiches that other reviewers suggested."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner by myself one evening. I feel like this is somewhere I should have been before, but can't remember ever eating here before. It was overwhelming for me (didn't know you got a tray and moved from section to section), but all I wanted was a sandwich so it was no big deal. I got the cuban chicken panini, which was good, not anything extraordinary. The staff was nice, and I'll definitely come back to try something else."}
{"text":"Awful service, they never get your order correct. The portion sizes and cuts of meat on the sandwiches is always too small or they forget to put meat on a sandwich. Always out of plates and bowls. 

The staff is absolutely clueless, don't come to this one the other ones are better"}
{"text":"Wow,Paradise Bakery used to be one of my favorite places to eat. However, don't think I'll be eating at the one at The Villages at San Tan Mall anymore. Store has been reconfigured. I guess they don't want customers to no longer be able to customize their salads. Portions are also ridiculously small. I paid for a large salad and when I questioned the amount of lettuce in it, I was told it was 2 cups worth. Yeah, right. Whole Foods got in a lot of trouble for this type of customer fraud. Personally so should Paradise Bakery. At least the cookies are still good."}
{"text":"We arrived at about 6:40am not knowing this place opens at 7. To my surprise, the manager opened the door, invited us inside and offered us coffee and breads. We were so thankful after having had a rough morning at the airport. Very high quality service. Thank you Alan!"}
{"text":"It's your standard bakery & cafe. The line on a Tuesday at lunch was pretty long - took 10 minutes to order, then another 15 to get the food. 

The menu looked good. I ordered a half  bacon turkey bravo sandwich, as recommended by the employee who took my order. The tomato basil bread is fantastic - best part of the sandwich. Oh! And it comes with a cookie!"}
{"text":"Great management, great service.  Excellent food!  They have a delicious Italian combo sandwich."}
{"text":"Their are only a few items I like here: 
\"Chicken Frontega panini\"
\"Chicken Walnut sandwich\"
\"Thai Chicken salad\" 
....Those are it. I don't like the cookies, the other sandwiches, or the other salads.... and I have tried most of them all. The cookies are a little bit too sweet, which is fine, but after I eat them, I feel sick to my stomach. I believe its because its super unhealthy. The other sandwiches I've tried there are overpriced for what they taste like, and could be easily made at home for less than $2. Depending on who you get to make the salad, the amount is always inconsistent. One worker will give you a lot.... while a different worker would give you too little amount. It would be nice to get consistency. 
The drinks are nothing to rave about. Maybe I'd get a vanilla ice coffee, but it really depends who makes it. There are times it tastes good, but sometimes it doesn't"}
{"text":"This is a typical and daily lunch place that I prefer to go, if I have time. I always enjoy their food (soup, salads, and sandwiches)...and the bakery goods. 

You can't go wrong here !!!"}
{"text":"Love their soups, love their salads. The sandwiches are a little strange for me, so I don't really enjoy those.
This is right in our neighborhood, so we go here..A LOT. Breakfast is good, and that menu changes every so often too.
Ample seating, clean and friendly service.
Get the frequent customer card-you rack up points for free meals, muffins and coffee.

Also for you moms out there, there's a changing table in the restroom that is in the big stall and there is plenty of room to maneuver a stroller in here. 
Hooray!"}
{"text":"Rode the bike in to have breakfast before the AZ August heat set in.  Every - and I do mean every - table was dirty.  We walked around and took a seat in the cleanest dirty booth they had.

Aside from the lack of cleanliness, the food was decent.  If we come again, it'll be out of hunger and not because it's our destination.

PS ~ Coffee was really good!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to have lunch or early dinner any day of the week.

Being that it's a bakery the bread, cookies and muffins are very good.

They have sandwiches, fresh tossed salads (tossed right in front of you) and soups.

I enjoy the Tuscan chicken which comes with an olive tapenade that is very yummy, so much so I ask for more.  Fresh chicken, tomatoes, cheese and basil makes it one of my favorites.  

Every sandwich or sandwich combo comes with a chocolate chip cookie (this thrill seems to be consistent with me if you've read any of my other reviews).

Every time I think of broccoli cheddar soup I feel like I'm eating cheese sauce, but their version is has slivers of carrots that make me feel just a little bit better.  A little.

Wide open seating, free wifi, great food makes this a great spot to get a bite and stay just a bit longer to lounge and let your food settle in."}
{"text":"*sigh*  Why did I come here?  I think it may have been the lack of coffee in my system, or maybe the heat has gotten to me already.  I really had such high hopes for this place, and honestly, I feel a little depressed after leaving this joint.

For starters, I feel like the place is wwwaaayyyy overpriced for what thier serving.  I don't think thier food is anything that special, and for being a bakery, thier bagel selection SUCKS.  I really wanted a bagel and coffee so badly, and I walked in there, and all they had was like a few bagels saran wrapped in a basket on the counter.  WTF??  

I then stared at their muffins for a while, and contemplated the meaning of life.  While doing this, I finally decided to order since my stomach was poking at me to put something in it. ugh!  

So, I got  a blueberry muffin and a small cup of coffee for $3.83.  That was 3.83 to much!  The coffee was okay, and the muffin was mediore. It felt really heavy in my arm taking it to the table, and I think I hurt my shoulder doing it.  My shoulder hurts anyways, but the heavy muffin just aggrivated my pain!

Anyways, while I was sitting in a booth drinking my coffee and 1 ton muffin, a busboy walked by my table and asked me if I was doing okay, and wanted to know if maybe I needed a glass of water.???  Do I look that bad?  I mean, can you tell my shoulder is killing me?  Do I look sick? *sigh*  I told him I was fine, and continued reading my book and eating my muffin.

This place does have a great amount of seating, and I like that.  Booths, tables and the like throughout the place.  You could come here with people and not feel like your tripping over anyone. Bonus for that!

I finally left.  Thank goodness for that."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to sit down and work... and people watch. The staff are friendly, food is great and WiFi (though finicky at times) is free. Since I work from home, I love to frequent this locale to refocus when distractions pop up. The staff here is courteous and doesn't mind me sitting here for hours on end refilling my drink for free. This is my choice for an office away from the office."}
{"text":"Good quick healthy options. Went with the small applewood salad with apple chips, pecans and such. The small was not your typical small. Great size and it tasted amazing. Clean with good service. Wish they had more than one water spout to get water. Always a line ."}
{"text":"I like their soup, but this was my first time having breakfast here.
1. Too expensive. I spent $10 on a Breakfast Croissant and a coffee.
2. I asked for a café latte (double expresso shot, I know the coffee in the US is not very strong, usually). The coffee tasted like milk. It was like colored milk. I asked for an extra shot since I didn't like it. And it still tasted like milk, yuk. So, for me, this was  really bad coffee. I couldn't drink it. It ruined my morning, I love my coffee in the morning so much.
3. The croissant was ok, but for the price it was not memorable."}
{"text":"I do love me some Paradise Bakery! This location is the convenient one to my office. I like it very much!

Lots of space, great for when it gets crowded at lunch time, plenty of staff to help, and everything is neat and clean. There is even a little guy running around the dining room refilling drinks and removing dishes and trays. They take time and put care into their food, and I always enjoy relaxing on my lunch break on their patio!

They ahve the best iced tea right now too - acai! Try it! And the chippers are always amazing!"}
{"text":"There's no better way to find out about a new eatery than to receive a gift card to one you've never been to (or heard of, for that matter). This happened to me when I received a gift card to Paradise Bakery. Being new to Phoenix, of course I Yelp'd it to find one nearby. I located this on on the SWC of Bell Rd and 7th Street while up at Sam's Club. 

Paradise Bakery has sandwiches, salads, soups, sides, and of course -- the bakery items! At this location, you can eat in or take out. I like the Turkey Bacon Bravo or the Turkey Cranberry with a side of their excellent mac 'n' cheese and a drink. Getting this combo also scores you a free cookie! 

This location is in the shopping area with a huge Target and many other stores, so the parking is hit or miss, depending on the time of day/week. And PB's prices are just a bit steep for what they serve...good food, but still a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Get the Thai chopped chicken salad and the chipotle chicken panini and all your  slightly spicy robust flavor cravings will be satisfied. I found that meal to have a very south American flavored Thai food feel haha!!! No that is not supposed to make sense its just fantastically delicious"}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery is one of my favorite sandwich places, also helps their cookies are good too.

My favorite order its the following:

Walnut Chicken Salad Sandwich - I could not even begin to describe this as well as Kelly R. (You go girl!!)

Paradise Pasta - Always yummy and their oil is never too over powering.

Fire Roasted Tomato Soup - OK I LIVE for the crunchies (Its a technical term), and sauce they put in this..and I do mean live, it is utterly fantastic!!

Lemon-aid

The lines are always quick, they greet you with a smile and they are consistent, thank goodness for that. Doesn't matter what location I am at, I always know what I am getting.

All in all it is really a great place and somewhere I never hesitate on eating at."}
{"text":"Ordered for pickup. Fast, quakity ,great food no issues. Excellent customer service! Highly recommend the tomato soup, steak and cheddar panini, and crumbly blue cheese salad."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery is a good place to meet a friend for hours of chatting or have a mini meeting without hogging up a Food Server's table at a full-service restaurant.

They have fantastic cookies, muffins, and overall baked goods. Coffee is decent.

Service is friendly at this location.

Prices are pricey for the overall value food ratio. If they were more reasonably priced, then I'd probably eat here more often. It's almost $7 bucks for an OMELETTE, I think you get some bread with it (I was never asked what type...I don't think it's even toast, just bread)...no hash browns or bacon. That's not a good value for breakfast.

It's a better deal to eat breakfast at Mimi's or Denny's....or for a few bucks LESS at McD's or any 'Berto's breakfast burrito.

Overall: I think Paradise Bakery has pricey ok food, I can think of many other places I would eat at first. I know people who are crazy in love about this place...I just don't get it."}

{"text":"I don't like to write 1 star reviews, but a dirty restaurant deserves 1 star.  

We arrived around 4pm for a late lunch/early dinner (on Thursday) and to work on a group project and ended up staying till 7pm.  During this 3 hour period I can attest that I wasn't just there during a shift change or slow period (like other reviews suggested).  

When we arrived the line was condensed to the area by the baked goods.  They only had 3 menu boards up on the wall (maybe they are in the process of being changed?) so I had to look at the menu when I got to the register, which annoyed the person taking my order.  They politely brought out my sandwich and it was fine - nothing amazing.  

But when I went to put away my tray, the return bin was overflowing with gross dishes and trash - it looked like it hadn't been cleaned for hours.  And there was a surplus of employees.  The drink stations were littered with trash and spills.... and this didn't change when I went to fill up my cup with water at 7pm before leaving.  Tables were dirty too. 

I know I'm not their ideal customer - staying and working on a project for 3 hours, but  I'm still a customer.  By being there for that long of a time period and to witness no change in the dirtiness, there are no excuses.  

The only saving grace of Paradise Cafe is that they offer their Iced Coffee in a canteen and it has free refills - great for working on projects!  So, I might try a different location."}
{"text":"When it was paradise bakery my husband and I would come every weekend, it is now Panera bread horrible horrible way pricier and all the food items changed the cookies are hard and are no longer buy one get one free stay away from this place Panera bread is not good at all."}
{"text":"Today my family had what I would consider the worse experience one could imagine when it comes to eating a meal, there was a large bug in my wife's Fugi Apple Chicken salad. On site she talked with an associate and he only refunded the salad... After leaving I shortly called and spoke with a manager and the entire meal was reimbursed on the card (which it should of been the 1st time without question!!). Not sure we will return back to any Paradise Bakery given the poor handling of food to remove bugs or any related items from a salad and lack of how they will be addressing going forward to ensure no one experiences the same thing! 

Simply disappointed with the entire experience & now we have 1 less 'healthy alternative' when it comes to dinning out!"}
{"text":"The food is great but the staff is not friendly at all. I still come for the food but very rude staff. They really seem like they don't enjoy working there. No smiles just shortness and rudeness. I don't enjoy coming in. If I can find somewhere else to go I would just to avoid the unhappiness in there."}
{"text":"Like the sandwiches and salads, the soup is just ok.  The free cookie is delightful and my daughter likes this place so I'd say it was kid friendly.  It is easy to order and check out but the staff is lacking as far as I'm concerned.  Some are friendly but I've come across some snobby behavior and some condescending attitudes as well.  The place is clean and comforting and I've seen quite a few people hanging out on their laptops so it must be a casual and relaxed atmosphere.  Pretty decent prices and I like the real plates / silverware.  The salmon salad was delish!"}
{"text":"This place is exactly what it should be--a fast food way of getting your soup and salad fix on those long work days. Its the kind of place where you get on a cafeteria-like line and pick up the food you want, then pay at the cashier, and then take your seat. Nothing too fancy, but the food is good. I got the Asian salad with chicken and apples and a french onion soup. Everything was delicious, aside from the dried apple bits that were in my salad, as opposed to fresh apples, but that just may be my taste. 

Overall, great place to grab a quick (healthy) bite!"}
{"text":"Shrinking portions + So-So Baked Goods + Friendly Service

Stopped by for lunch at this Paradise Bakery as it was the choice of our daughter on her birthday. Very friendly staff, but I was surprised how every little thing seemed to have a special charge. Heart cookie instead of chocolate chip? Extra $2. Cheese on ham sandwich? Add $0.50. Croissant bread instead of sourdough? $0.75 additional, yo! Even the staff complained about the menu changes last year and having to nickle and dime customers.

On top of everything, the baked goods aren't as tasty we recalled. My wife complained about the severe lemon flavor in the heart cookie. Chocolate chip cookies we so average that none of us finished ours. And we NEVER leave cookies unfinished!

At least the food was good. Small servings mind you, but maybe they are hinting that we Americans eat too much and need to adjust our portion sizes down. Fair enough if that's their aim."}
{"text":"Food is good. Kids menu lunches don't come with a drink which is a bummer. Cashier not very helpful but bus person very helpful."}
{"text":"Cookies

If cookie monster had not been arrested in Times Square recently I would say that you could find him here eating all the yummy COOKIES.

I like to stroll over here and devour a few dozen cookies now and again... I guess you could call ME a cookie monster (legal).

Everyone here is so friendly and sometimes even gives me FREE COOKIES when I order 2 they give me 3 etc...

I've eaten other food here a few times, chili was good, but no tabasco was available to make it better.

Never had a sandwich here so can't say. I will say it one more time though:

COOKIES (no one judges you for it)

{"text":"This location used to be good... Great customer service and great food... Today I came in and the place was in shambles, first impression... We go and order and pay... The girl asked for here or to go? And we said for here of course... If your restaurant is a mess we wanna eat there... She also spelled my name \"Toni\" which is the female spelling of my name... I am very manly. After waiting 20 minutes for our food I went up front to notice everyone was standing around playing backgammon... I asked when my food would be ready and they all looked confused, then they realized it was sitting there for 10 minutes as a to go order.... I went back to my seat with my food and noticed my sandwich was rather cold and hard, which is the opposite to the way I ordered it. I asked them to remake it and 2 minutes later I was brought back the same sandwich which was regrilled and burned... Kudos to having a messy, disorganized restaurant and a staff that fits right in!"}
{"text":"Since this place has transitioned to Panera, everything has gone downhill. The kids' meals no longer come with drinks or cookies, so you end up paying $8 per kid to get it! What a joke! They've discontinued our favorite items and reduced their sandwich sizes too! You no longer get what you pay for here. With all the money they're saving, you'd think they'd be able to afford to reupholster their seats which are totally cracking and falling apart in the booths. I don't think we'll be coming back to Paradise bakery now that it's Panera. Sad to have lost a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum!! Check it out now, funk show brotha... ok I'll stop.

This place is G - double O - D. Good!

I LOVE their strawberry smoothie (I prefer it over Jamba) and love the Mediterranean Egg White Sandwich (breakfast) and the Tomato Mozzarella is pretty good too. I haven't tried much, but it all has been good so far. A little pricey but it's healthier than most places so I don't mind.

The only thing I don't like is that it's confusing! Their organization is weird! Where you order, what you order where, I've been sent to different counters for different things, different registers, etc. and I'm pretty \"with it\" if you know what I mean and even I get confused when I walk in! lol. I also don't like that I can never find a trashcan! Random I know, but I've been there multiple times and I still can't find it! lol annoying, but ah well.

I like this place and I will continue to go there as long as they're around. I've been to the location in Goodyear also and the food was good there too! If you're around go check them out!"}
{"text":"The soups were pretty pedestrian, but the French onion just had tons of onions in a broth and croutons galore with a flop of cheese on the bottom. I miss good French onion with a cheese crust on the top. Also, the soups were barely even Luke warm. The sandwiches had okay flavor, but for the price they were so small. I would have rather had a big sandwich and skipped the mediocre chocolate chip cookie. The roll that came with the sandwich (odd) was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood paradise bakery. I've been coming to this location for over 2 years maybe even longer because it's right down the street from my job. I'm pretty sure that I've tried every item on the menu and I have yet to be disappointed! The staff here has always been nice and somewhat energetic. Even though my order has been incorrect a few times, every time that I come back to get the ocorrected they have no problem fixing it and comping me for the meal.

I love the rewards program, it keeps track of your visits, drinks & meals you order.  So once you get to a certain amount of meals or drinks you start getting free deals. 

All in all, paradise bakery feels like family. I know that sounds a little weird however from the amount of money that I put into this place I should be a shareholder.  I will continue to come and be a happy customer"}
{"text":"Not impressed with Paradise at all. I got half a sandwich and a tiny bowl of soup and asked for another cookie and it was $10!! The sandwich was alright and the soup was meh. For that amount, I  can go to Zupas and get a entire soup, a big bowl of soup or salad, a cholocate dipped strawberry, and a piece of bread, and a drink!!! Don't waste your time and money, if you want a a good lunch go to zupas!!"}

Not a healthly place, like subway?  I know the sandwich is full of flavor and with that calories. Also the cookies they give you with your sandwich is most likely not on a healthly diet.  
I come here for a good tasting sandwich and the great tasting cookies however.. You should also :)"}

It really does mean a lot and she goes out of her way for me EVERY YEAR! Thanks girl. Never had a bad experience here. will be a lifer!!"}
{"text":"Ehh this used to be a great place for lunch. It is a little pricey, for a salad and a tea in my opinion. Plus this location has been under some sort of remodel/construction.... maybe a change in entity ownership for almost 4 months now.

All I know is the change is not very speedy... the ordering process is always different each time I go in, there is no consistency."}

{"text":"This place reminds me of Panera Bread from back east!  

Location & Aesthetics - Located at Litchfield and Bell in Surprise.  
Lots of parking space and the restaurant is spacious, clean and well lit.  Noise level isn't too bad.

Menu - very extensive and spans about three walls.  What's nice is the soup menu is clear and separate from the others, e.g. salad, drinks, entrees.  They're all on separate menus.

Service - Staff was super friendly, helpful and answered any questions we had.    

Food - I ordered along with my party, ordered the Pick 2.  I had the newly released flatbread - Thai Chicken with the bowl of salad and the Strawberry with Ginseng smoothie.
The flatbread reminded me of a taco and one in my party said it reminded them of a Naan bread.  It was well toasted and filled with lots of chicken and other stuff and there was that definite Thai taste of mixed sweet, tangy, spicy taste and it wasn't even that spicy might I add.  The bowl of salad - the strawberry, poppy seed was very taste with all fresh vegetables and fruit....very crunchy!  The salad dressing was a hint and wasn't overwhelming!
The strawberry with ginseng smoothie was low salt so you don't get that sugar high yet it was still smooth and very cold!  Very tasty.  The meal comes with a complimentary cookie and despite not liking the one I was already given - chocolate chip, I was given one that I preferred - oatmeal raisin that was free!

Will most definitely be returning to try many of their other items on the menu and to also try their to-go service!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food and the selection since they moved from Paradis to panera bread company has gone way down hill... Not to mention that the cashier with all of the makeup is one of the more rude people I have ever been waited on. I was left with the impression that we were bothering her so much by being here that I won't be back.  At least Miranda the food delivery person was polite and nice. That eeked out an extra star."}
{"text":"Jorden is great!! Always super friendly and helpful;)"}
{"text":"Food is good as expected. Looses 1-star for slow staff cleaning tables, too many patrons clearing tables themselves or running down staff trying to get a clean table. Too bad!!"}
{"text":"AVOID THIS LOCATION LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!

We went here before a training class since it was close to our hotel.  Our group arrived about 6:45am thinking we would have plenty of time (class at 8, 5min away) ready for some breakfast and good eats, but instead we were greeted with awful service, an extensive wait, and ultimately no food.  It took an eternity to order because of their inefficient process and when I asked an approximate eta, all I was told was that they were doing the best they could.  After 45min of waiting, we ended up canceling our order and leaving.  Don't go here!!!!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with paradise bakery! Sandwiches are tasty, tomato soup is on point and a cookie with some coffee add a nice finishing touch! This location only gets four stars because they always run out of something. \"what? no roll for my soup?\" \"no tomato? you're kidding.\""}
{"text":"I was so excited to find this location near my work. Love the Classic Salad with Chicken. Within 3 visits the layout changed. Now you have to stand in line and at some point you will have access to a hand-held menu. Very awkward - why not just menu boards like before?

Now you can't just go through stations and get what you want or need. You have to go out of your way to ask for and wait for butter ??? Lemons for tea ???  The whole restaurant now seems chaotic and disorganized and I hate going there.  Seems like the prelude to going out of business to me."}
{"text":"I'm so excited Paradise Bakery finally came to me!

A really great place to get different sandwiches, soups, and salads extremely fresh.  The turkey cranberry sandwich is my true favorite.  It's Thanksgiving in a nice little molassas bread package.  And how can you go wrong with a free chocolate chip cookie?  Soft in the middle, chewy crisp on the edges, and oodles of melty chocolate chips.

Chocolate good.

The fire roasted tomato soup is also a nice sweet and tart warm treat complete with a little sour cream and crispy tortilla strips served on top.

Since this is a new location however, everyone in Surprise has now flocked over, so it's highly suggested you figure out what you want to get before you get there.  It felt like I was at a cow auction, everyone yelling their orders over the counter.  Yikes, can we say sardines in a can??  The staff was good natured and fast, so it made up for the tumble of people.  Plus samples of their tempting delights awaited you as you slid your tray down the line.

Free stuff good."}
{"text":"yes its true i do like paradise bakery because of the salads, paradise pasta and of course the cookies.  what i could see that could be improved here are two categories- what they could realistically improve and what they don't have control over.

what they could realistically improve: i dislike the order at this station for sandwiches then order at this station for salads but wait you get your food now and pay at the cashier station.  the lines can get out to the door on the weekends and can be confusing for people that have never been.  the food is considered \"quick food\" but normally those lines can cause a huge wait. 

what they don't have control over:  the clientele -(not the regulars) are darn right rude and impatient.  I have had some bad experiences with folks here trying to cut in line.  we decided to eat here once and a senior citizen man asked if he could take half of our table since it was just me and my husband having lunch. I thought that was so strange and you would think he would ask management for a request like that. since we were almost done we agreed but i still thought it was overbearing of him. of course we didn't let it ruin our day.

overall why do I subject myself to this? salads. it's always to go now but i don't like the lines and madness that goes on here on the weekends. :/"}
{"text":"We love the food here!  But the service is pathetic. There is a line for every type of food (salad, sandwich, soup, bakery). However there are no signs to tell you this. You just have to figure it out on your own. The lines overlap so you end up waiting forever OR skip to the right place and people give you nasty looks!  We have given up going here even though we like the food!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here trying to get some bread to take home and make a sandwich with.  When I walked in, the only \"bread\" they had were bagels really.  This is more of a soup/sandwich/salad type casual restaurant.  Good to know!   I could not leave empty handed though.  I saw the display case full of cookies.  Buy 6, get 6 free?  Sure...lets do it!  I got 4 chocolate chip, 4 coconut chocolate chip and 4 peanut butter.  Just over $9.00.  These cookies were fantastic!  Nice and rich and buttery and loaded with toppings and nuts.  They are $1.45 each but the dozen deal is easily the way to go.  These pair well with a glass of milk.  I'm getting all my bad eating out of the way until my wife moves out.  I may have to stop here once more for these cookies.  They are heavenly!"}
{"text":"I work in the mall, this is one of the better choices of places to eat. Most of the gals who ring me up/take my order get it right. But one. I'm guess she's is the manager. She never pays attention to me when ordering or forgets what I say. She also butchers my name. But, the food has improved since my last review."}
{"text":"I like Paradise, don't get me wrong.  They've got some good salads, and they don't blink an eye when you start asking for more of this and less of that as they're putting them together but if they want more stars, they're going to have to bring back that chicken (or was it turkey) sandwich with the chipotle aioli, avocado and jicama slices.  THAT WAS SO GOOD!  Back in the good old days when I worked at the interior design company we were out tagging furniture at some model homes for reuse and we ate at Paradise two days in a row because that sandwich was so good.  Alas, no more sandwich and only three stars.  You bring back my sandwich, I'll give you your stars."}
{"text":"The chicken walnut sandwich on molasses bread is great."}
{"text":"I always like to stop at Paradise bakery because I like their tea only today I purchased a muffin.  I just wished I didn't have terrible allergies right now because well I couldn't taste it.  

This review is based on service.  The staff is pleasant and nice.  They were all working together to get our order completed."}
{"text":"First time here and it doesn't really make me want to come back. I got up to the counter to order and someone quickly came over. I got the standard hello greeting. I old her I wanted the pick 2 with tortellini Alfredo and a Caesar salad. He asked if I wanted chicken and I told her no. She then handed me a yellow paper and said thank you. I assume I was just supposed to walk down to the register. Another girl had walked in after me am started ordering from a guy in my path in front of me. Is that normal? The girl at the register was super friendly. I think her name is Joie. That's what my receipt says. She offered me soup and a drink. I took the drink. When I sat at my table they brought me a small bowl of pasta and the man asked if I needed anything else. I said no and that I ordered a Caesar salad as well. He said ok and walked away. Ten minutes later and no salad. Then I realize my receipt doesn't show a salad. So I paid nine dollars for a handful of pasta and a drink?! Plus the pasta was very cold on too and luke warm on bottom. Not a great first impression."}
{"text":"We stop at this location every time we come to visit our daughter who is nearby at college. Their food is fresh and the service is top-notch. We usually get a salad and soup. While our main entrees are always tasty, the primary reason we come here is for the cookies. The Snickerdoodles are out of this world! My husband says they are better than his moms, who happens to be a killer cook. (Hopefully she doesn't read this review.) We usually buy a dozen to last us a few days. Considering having my daughter bring them home st Christmas got my husband. Give the place a try. Can't go wrong if your looking for a healthy, fresh, tasty lunch."}
{"text":"My first time going to Paradise bakery, lucky by boss treated us, cause if i was spending my money I would have went down the street.  The food was OK, I tasted better, but the customer services was sub par at best.   The Manager (looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there) lol  Had kissing lips tattoo on his neck?  How professional is that ??  The cashier was plain rude and special needs.  For the amount on money we spend 30 bucks I would have went down street to red lobster. Good Food excellent customer  service.     Will I come back Probably Not."}
{"text":"Great food always, Great service.  Jorden was helpful in making a great salad decision and very polite."}
{"text":"The salads are very good here everything seems fresh... The prices are a bit high in my opinion and the serving size is way too big even for half a salad I end up having to get a to-go box to take the rest home. I do love that they have an option for ice coffee where the beverages are and it's really good!!"}
{"text":"Came here just for some cookies today. 
usually get a chicken walnut at the Scottsdale 101 location which is delicious!
however this location's service is not near as good. walked in, wasn't greeted, walked to the counter and bought my cookies and the cashier was very rude. probably won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"This location always weirds me out a little. They don't use gloves on the salad station. Instead they use tongs -- which I sure hope are sanitized between each salad -- and grab a little of each ingredient with the same tongs. The germaphobe in me worries about food safety for people with allergies. You're just cross contaminating all the ingredients there. Plus they don't all have to wear hats here, apparently. So whoever is making your salad is free to shed into your food.

I do enjoy Paradise Bakery, but I'm a bit weary of the food at this store. This was probably my last visit to this location."}
{"text":"I love this place, the only complaint I have is that every time I come here for lunch, they are sold out of snickerdoodle cookies. I'm sure this is one of their top sellers, so I would think they would be prepared for the afternoon lunch rush and ensure they do not run out. Unfortunately this has not been the case the past 4 times I have gone here for lunch. All in all the service is usually really good. Food has always been really good!"}
{"text":"Typical Paradise Bakery experience - - - fast service, friendly staff, good bakery items (cookies!), and decent sandwiches. 

I typically frequent this one, when I'm on my way to Tucson and need to grab something quick to eat. 

At my last visit, they told me that they're merging with Panera Bread... hmmm. :) (But I can't use my Panera card here, just my frequent Paradise Bakery card.)

Favorite cookie: Coconut Chocolate Chip :)"}
{"text":"I have tried on numerous occasions to like this place, especially considering the general lack of breakfast options in Surprise, but the utter lack of expediency in this place just ruins it for me. Three times I've placed orders that have taken over 20 minutes to fill. Today alone, 33 minutes to get a sausage and egg Ciabatta to go!!! 33 minutes?!?! And of course, standing there for that long I got to watch the chaos in the prepping area as the staff attempted to figure it all out. And I wasn't even the one complaining. That was left up to several other guests who hadn't even waited as long as I had! Like I said, this isn't an isolated experience either. I have watched the same manager repeatedly offer less than sincere apologies to upset customers and not even so much as a smile. Although today she did offer one ticked off lady some free cookies...cause who doesn't want cookies at 10am???!!! Get it together Paradise cause you're anything but!"}
{"text":"Why do people love this place?  MommaKat insisted on snacking here after a hard day of shopping, and I am not impressed.  AT ALL.

I had to coerce the boy behind the counter to make a salad my way, not the normal recipe.  It was like pulling teeth.. no seriously, no cheese.  and I want this dressing not that dressing.  

We stood in line for over 20 minutes at 4pm on a Saturday.  There were 2 couples in front of us.  LAME.

There were no forks, and the cashier forgot to give me my brownie, and i thought he was going to have a conniption when I asked twice.

Bathrooms were very nice and clean though.  Outdoor seating is very limited. 

Lame excuse for a panera-"}
{"text":"Average service - not one person said thank you.  And they were out of black pepper packets. What kind of a restaurant runs out of black pepper?  The food is good here, but the service has never been  above average."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it a 2 star because I absolutely think Paradise bakery is idiotically overpriced. Yes, the food is good but we had a breakfast sandwich and a small salad...no chicken, two drinks and it was almost 18 dollars. 
My husband had a mozzarella and tomato sandwich and I had the SW Cesar salad. I really like this salad but again this place is completely over priced for a sandwich shop. 
Maybe if they reduced all their items by $1.00 and not run their a/c unit as if they were chilling meat...it maybe a bit more bearable."}
{"text":"This is the third Paradise Bakery I've reviewed, so it's apparent I love the place. This is the cleanest one I've been in. Still haven't had anything other than the Bleu Cheese crumble salad, but I'm a creature of habit. :-)  I did take a couple of bites of the husband's Southwestern Caesar, and it was pretty good too. It has quite a kick so if you don't like spicy I don't recommend it. He doesn't like a lot of heat and it was too much for him. Paradise is a good \"I am not sure where to go so I'll stick with what I know\" sort of place to eat."}
{"text":"I was visiting surprise arizona for the weekend, and what a surprise I was really hungry Sunday morning before having to head back to LA and needed a good bagel breakfast sandwich. Since this area seems to be up and coming and doesn't have to many bagel shops I found this place on Yelp. Luckily it was just like Panera and the prices were about the same. 2 bagel sandwiches, 2 cappaccinos was $22. Yikes, very steep. But I just needed to fill up the belly before the 5 hour drive back home. The food like whatever and the capaccino had very little foam but when you are out of town you can't expect much!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was inviting,  but very cold,  the food was fresh and tasted OK,  but nothing special.   The issue at my visit was the staff
  I had never been here and didn't know how it worked,  the staff was not cordial nor helpful.   Young and very little customer service skills.   For the price it isn't really worth it.   I would rate a place higher if the food was medicare and the staff was more inviting.   Here the food is slightly better than mediocre and the staff... Well they could use some customer service lessons."}
{"text":"Food--The fire roasted garlic tomato soup is excellent.  They sprinkle tortilla chips for garnish over a tiny dollop of sour cream.  Mmmmm.  Yummy.  The mixed green salad with albacore tuna is also a delightful choice, as is the turkey wrap and CA Chicken sandwich with pesto mayo.  Drip coffee and espresso drinks are good, too.  Overall, everything tastes great because it's made fresh.  No pre-packaged items here.

Seating--Lots of booths and tables inside and out.  They have a cozy little set up with what looks to be 'lounge' chairs that accommodates 6 with swivel tables perfect, for savoring your beverage of choice.  The rest of the dining area looks like it has capacity for about 100 people, if all seats were filled despite a placard declaring the maximum capacity is '311'.

Peak times--avoid lunchtime during the weekdays.  It would appear that all of Surprise is feenin for a sandwich or soup/salad special from PB during 11-1PM.  The lines are long and you can forget about getting back to work in under an hour if you factor in commute time, food prep & consumption.  IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.  The only time service has been 'fast' is during breakfast.  I've been there for a breakfast networking event and on a Saturday.  During these times, I received my order promptly and had little trouble locating a table.

Free stuff--this would include WiFi, bread samples with tasty spreads, muffin and/or cookie bits.  Bonus points for free stuff!

PB is open Mon-Sat 7AM-9PM and Sun 7AM-6PM."}
{"text":"This a great place to grab some real food. Don't be intimidated by a long line.  They are quick and organized.  Staff is always friendly and the food is delicious... except the grilled cheese. Stay away from the grilled \"cheese\". They don't deliver,  but they do cater and they also have a points reward system which can quickly result in a free menu item.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"So be aware paradise bakery just got bought out by Panera.. Pretty much the same thing though except for the way you order your food. Today was my carb day so I was super excited to get some lunch at paradise bakery because I have been CRAVING broccoli chedder soup for the longest time!!! I walked in and the whole process changed on how you order. I went up to the counter and ordered my soup and salad and was told This was their full first week doing their new process. I went and hung out waiting for a soup and salad.... and I waited.... and I waited..... Manager came up to me after semi- patiently waiting for 15 min. She offered to get me a treat but I respectfully declined since I don't eat much sugary treats these day. She said she would just on my order and then came back and asked for my receipt. She offered me a full refund as a courtesy since I had been waiting for SOUP AND SALAD to be made. Lol... She was very kind and I appreciated the gesture. Next time I will be ordering online since this burned pretty much all my lunch."}
{"text":"Great place for salads...BUT falls short of its parent company Panera. Unlike Panera, Paradise does not offer, nor do they have bread selections with their salads, with the price about the same. Additionally, unlike their parent company Paradise does not offer a pastry at a reduced price (99-cents) when you purchase a salad and drink. Good place to eat, but disappointed if you are thinking about Panera."}
{"text":"Your salads keep getting smaller and smaller. I ordered a half Chicken Caesar salad to go and the employee fill the box half full. I just got half of a half and paid $5. A head of Lettuce at Fry's is 99¢. Should I bring a head of lettuce to them and ask them to make me one?"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed here was the price, holy cow was it expensive. But I heard it was good so I tried it. I ordered the turkey avocado sandwich. It took a decent amount of time to come out, and the girl who rang me up went back to check and see what was taking so long. I appreciated that she felt it was taking longer than normal, and acted on it. She came back to me with my sandwich and a cookie, and explained to me that they were short people that day, which happens anywhere. Overall the food is  really good, with good service, but a little pricey."}
{"text":"Location: it is located at a big shopping center. The restaurant has lots of seating areas and is relatively clean. I love the seating as it is relaxing and comforting. I don't mind hanging out here enjoying a delicious soup and a sandwich. 

Service: staffs are friendly and patience. When business is getting busier, I can see other staffs immediately step up to help each other out. 

Food: I ordered half a sandwich and onion soup and it was OK. 

Rating: overall I think its average. The restaurant is a great place to hang out but I can't say the food is amazing."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Paradise Bakery.  

Primarily, when I think about Paradise Bakery, their baked good come to mind.  I love their cookies and muffins.  Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal Raisin are two of my favorite cookies, and the Blueberry Muffins are outstanding.  I recently tried some of my wife's Cranberry scone and became a quick fan of those as well.

I've also taken my family for lunch or dinner here a few times, and each time I'm left regretting the decision.  The kids menu is very limited, and none of my kids have been able to find something they like.  I've tried a few items from the menu, and I liked one of the sandwiches (primarily the Turkey Cranberry).  Most of the other items were okay, but nothing terribly special.  With the high prices, it just doesn't make sense.

Bottom line: great place to get some treats, but I'd pass on lunch or dinner."}
