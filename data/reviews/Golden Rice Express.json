{"text":"Inexpensive and reliable Chinese take-out. Most dishes are around $7 and the most expensive dish is $9.  It's in strip mall right next to Fry's Grocery so the atmosphere is very basic, but clean.  The Hong Kong style pan fried noodles were authentic--crispy noodles and the sauce was neither too heavy nor too sweet. The lemon chicken and the lemon sauce  tends to be too sweet and gooey and most Chinese restaurants, but this was not the case here. W. likes the mince beef fried rice here as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the BEST!! The garlic chicken and orange chicken are delicious. The good is prepared when u order, always great tasting and staff friendly.  Excellent customer service and safe food handling. The restaurant was remodeled so very modern. The prices are great too. This is the best chinese food!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and always delivered exactly as ordered and I customize everything. Sometimes delivery takes a while but as a frequent customer I know when that happens it is because they are busy. Hard to criticize a place because they are busy. To me that is a good sign when a restaurant is busy. Also regardless of time of delivery food always hot and fresh . I normally have delivery but when have stopped in for carry out Sandy has given me a ride home!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken chow fun for lunch today. Flavor was good but a little lacking as well as a bit on the greasy side. Came out to about $8 and the serving size could probably feed two."}
{"text":"I've been going to Golden Rice for quite some time.  My Mom introduced me while she worked nearby back when I was in high school.  She used to order me the sweet and sour chicken noodle bowl.  Freaking amazing.  How do they get their chicken fried like that?  I eventually started ordering other things.  Their egg foo yong is the best I've tasted.  You can't really go wrong with anything on their menu.  Their fried rices are really good."}
{"text":"When I used to live around the area years ago this place was really handy. Cheap and reasonably good food for what I paid. It was never OMG I can't wait to get certain things out of this place. I was recently around the area and amazed the place is still open. I was hungry and wasn't feeling like eating salads so I ordered mixed veggies and rice. The food is ok just like before nothing special but it's hot so I know they cook it then when I ordered. The other thing that is a bit of a put off for me is the location around the restaurant. It feels a bit grungy."}
{"text":"This place sucked. Ordered Orange Chicken with fried rice and could hardly stomach it. Some of the worse Chinese food I've had in awhile.  Service was nice and friendly, place seemed clean enough, but done on the cheap."}
{"text":"I ordered using the Yelp Eat24 app. My order confirmation for pick up from the location was 6:36pm. I arrived at the restraunt at 6:46pm for them to tell me they did not start the order yet. This is beyond ridiculous and inconvenient. I even went to the grocery store in same plaza to kill time. This is not good customer service and I definitely won't return."}
{"text":"The food is awful! And very confusing. My husband's order came with a tortilla? We were very confused about the tortilla lol my orange chicken came with the sauce separately, which I thought was neat at first but the chicken was very hard and ended up tasting like rubber. The low mein did not taste like low mein. The only thing I liked was the white rice."}
{"text":"This is a really great Chinese place. It's family owned and the owners are so nice. Love eating here whenever I'm nearby. It's a hole in the wall place but those are always the best!"}
{"text":"For being basic as it gets. Great value for the money, excellent service, and the food was great. My only complaint is there's no soda fountain. Boo..."}
{"text":"Had the chefs special with pan fried noodles, shrimp, chicken, and beef with a egg roll on the side.  It was 9 bucks or so for the meal.  Everything came out piping hot and the portion was HUGE!   The noodles were pretty good but the meat was just ok.  The sauce was okay too.  The egg roll was right in the middle of the road.  I would come here again but its not on my hit list by any means.  Too bad they dont do half portions.  That meal was too big for any one person to eat.  Honestly it could have filled three grown men.  No lie.  Id rather of paid half the price and received half the food if it were an option.  Next time I will be sure to bring a friend to share it with."}
{"text":"It appears slightly run down from the exterior, but when you enter you are greeted by a friendly spirit, just like any family owned restaurant in town. I arrived in time for the lunch special, I ordered a teriyaki rice bowl with veggies added. It was piping hot!! The meat was actually quite good, no odd/chewy meat parts, the flavor was comparable to Mandarin Chicken from Panda Express. They added a nice variety of complimenting veggies, and the sauce poured over my meal was delicious. I must mention that there was an over abundance of sauce added. Portioning was great, there was enough for leftovers (considering that I didn't have a big appetite). My boyfriend said it tasted burnt, but I would have to disagree and say their teriyaki is as tasty as Panda's, and is worth a try!"}
{"text":"I can't explain well enough how gross it is to try and eat Chinese food and question the meat! Should be zero stars. Ordered chicken teriyaki bowl. Many people use frozen \"chicken\" but they work well with it this not so much. Even tasted rancid. Also ordered hot and sour soup....so oily and just wrong flavor completely. Will never return. Tried this place before remember the nasty meat husband ordered not remembering had to write this since its all worse. I rather drive 3 miles past this place to get the good stuff.    -You have to know you're not doing your best."}
{"text":"The pork egg foo young was fantastic and the service is quick and friendly a must try again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Not only are the people so very friendly but the food and service is incredible!   I eat here once in a while, maybe once a month or once every 2-3 months, and I have never been disappointed. All of the food is just spot on delicious!   I have no complaints whatsoever. It doesn't take too long, the people are always nice, the location is good, and the food is perfect!  Got this for Mother's Day and they gave us a bunch of free almond cookies! Delicious and so nice of them!"}
{"text":"I really like this place a lot for so many reasons. One it is right outside my complex and two the food is yummy but best of all the portions are very good. I love the pork fried rice with shrimp chop suey and the fried shrimp is very delish too. The staff is always so friendly and helpful plus they deliver for those days I can't even move because of pain :)"}
{"text":"The sesame chicken was covered in a brown sauce that was so sweet it was like candy. Yes sesame chicken is supposed to be sweet, but not this sweet. The curry chicken was spicy without the flavor profile of a good curry. The crab puffs were barely edible and the wontons were not edible at all. The only decent thing we got were egg rolls. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Not good. I remember my parents complaining about the chicken tasting rubbery here and that food did not taste good.. I still ended up trying this place anyways and my friend and I both got sick from it.."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place several times for their 3 combination plate.  I always get the seseame chicken with the fried rice and add $2.00 worth of shrimp.  It's the best I've had since I've been here in Phoenix.  I've also order shrimp fried rice and love it.  Great place, decor not that great but very good food.  Will continue going there."}
{"text":"The food is great and cheap. Cheaper than panda. You can't go wrong with the rice bowls, they're around $5. I always pick up so I dont know about deliveries. I recommend it."}
{"text":"I've lived in this area 16 years and was afraid to try this place bc I have tried other chinese restaurants that were not taste appealing.  I ordered the Moo Shu Chicken it was very good and probably way better than the other Chinese restaurants such as Big Heng which it has gone downhill.  Golden Rice Express Restaurant has been here as long as I lived here probably longer.  It is a clean and decent fast food takeout.  They do take their time which tells me it's not sitting in the corner somewhere like most Chinese restaurants around here.  The service is awesome and most of the other Chinese restaurants the service staff are rude, not GRE they are hospitable and have a friendly smile."}
{"text":"Sesame Chicken is always my default choice from this spot!"}
{"text":"Golden Rice Express has become my favorite go-to Chinese restaurant! I was referred here a couple of years ago, and have been going ever since.   It's a small place great for grabbing a quick bite or ordering take out and the food is always ready within 10 - 15 minutes. They also do delivery, but I've never experienced their delivery service since I live close by and am not lazy.   Portions are large, food is really good and authentic, and the prices are cheap. They also get 5 stars from me for their excellent service - the guy who is always there (who I think is the owner) is super nice. I'd recommend trying their chicken with garlic sauce or sesame chicken."}
{"text":"I have lived near this place for 15 years and never went in because the outside wasn't appealing.  My husband ordered delivery one night and I was absolutely wow'd by the food!  The egg drop soup is amazing and so is the curry chicken!  We have ordered several times since and the food is always stellar and super fresh."}
{"text":"Ok so this was my first time going here. I had always seen this place since I've lived in Glendale for so long but I never ventured inside. My total meal cost was about $11 for a two item combo with chow mein and six crab puffs.   Teriyaki chicken - This is more like a sweet soy sauce chicken. The sauce was not very thick at all. The chicken came in huge chunks  Kung pao chicken - Wasn't very good at all. It had a lot of water chestnuts and what looked like very minced up meat. Was not spicy one bit.   Chow mein - Tasted like it has been cooking in a pan that has been used over and over and over again. Lots of carbon or charcoal type taste like if it came off a barbecue grill.   Crab puffs - These barely had any cream cheese or \"crab\" I couldn't believe how most of the times I would bite into one and there would be barely anything in it at all.   Overall I will definitely not be going back here again it was really sloppy really greasy and didn't come as expected. The only reason why I gave it a two star rating is because the guy on the phone was actually able to comprehend English when taking my order. Great and now my stomach started to hurt!"}
{"text":"This place is about 4 doors down from where I get my hair cut.  I decided I wanted something different for lunch after my hair cut this time.  For some reason I expected it to have some worn edges because it has been here so long, but it doesn't.  While being very plain, it is very clean and orderly.  I was the only one eating in on this Friday for lunch.  Two single take out orders also were processed.  It may pick up a bit later, I arrived right after they opened at 11.  I had the garlic chicken lunch special ($4.25) and an iced tea ($1.50).  The chicken also had onions and other veggies.  Even though the plate did not get served with chopsticks I would have expected the chicken to be cut so it could be, several pieces of the chicken were quite a mouth full.  What may have been not enough heat for some in a spicy dish was just right for me.  They note on the menu they can adjust the heat on request.  To me there were no off flavors and I left full."}
{"text":"Not awful but not good either. Fried rice lacked flavor and salt. Sesame chicken had a weird taste to it. Pot stickers were huge in size but bland. Lo mein was the best item, great flavor. Overall I felt it was a waste of money and a chain like Panda Express is much better, mind you I'm not one for chains. I feel bad that I don't have nicer things to say about the food as I was hopeful since the place looks run down which to me is often indicative that I'm about to get my taste buds blown away (in a good way). The man was super nice though and offered great service."}
{"text":"Well, the place was clean enough and the price was alright. They have good lunch combos and their egg rolls are better-than-average. Had a Sweet/Sour chicken lunch combo, came with a little fried rice, one egg roll, and two fried wontons (whole)  However, their fried rice has almost nothing in it, just a little egg and it is a little brown but I don't think it has really been fried. There are no vegetables in the fried rice like you see at most other places, so -1 star.  Another -1 star because of their soy sauce. This is my biggest gripe about Asian take-out; they use the fake 'Panda' brand soy sauce that is artificially flavored and tastes like plastic. At least if you dine-in you can get the naturally-brewed Kikkoman soy sauce. If you get take out, ask for an empty sauce container and a lid for it so you can pour some real soy sauce out of the bottle before you leave. This wouldn't bother me so much if it weren't that if I can taste the difference, I KNOW they can."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have eaten here.  It is just ok.  It accomplished what I set out to do...eat fast, eat cheap, eat Chinese, and counter-service.  Mission accomplished.  I order the 2 item lunch combo of Chicken w/ veggies, S/S Chicken and white rice. There was no soda fountain, only canned soda. I opted for water. I was give a 6 oz styrofoam coffee cup filled with ice and water poured from a plastic bottle. The total was like $5 or $6 bucks plus I tipped a $1.  Bathroom is ok...light switch was dirty and seat was left up.   Food came out ok time wise; piping hot and this place had NO A/C.  So I lost weight sweating while eating lunch. ugh.  The food tasted ok. Not great; not the worst (like buffet). I like the S/S sauce, so that was a plus.  I got a HUGE mound of white rice, which I could not eat all of, and all but one piece of broccoli could not be chewed though.  A knife might have been a nice to have, but none was offered.   I would probably go back in WINTER for my next visit."}
{"text":"Garlic chicken has too much onion and sauce was way too sweet. Very little chicken and too saucy."}
{"text":"This place is nothing to get too excited about. I ordered the sweet and sour pork dinner size and teriyaki chicken combo, which came up to be around 17 bucks. The teriyaki chicken was bathed in a watered down sauce and lacked some flavor. The rice that came in the combo was a poor excuse for fried egg fried rice. The sweet and sour pork came in a much smaller portion that what I expected. The breading-to-pork ratio was way off, I'd take a bite and would get a mouthful of oily breading with a small chunk of pork burrowed inside. The sweet and sour sauce was a lot more sour than sweet in my opinion also.  What I did really like about this place is the communication between the restaurant and customer. I myself work at a Chinese place down the street and am impressed with their transparency. As soon as you walk into the dining area, there are signs posted everywhere and pictures of dishes, which is rare for a Chinese restaurant. The lady working the register was very friendly. AND they serve you filtered water rather than tap water, always a plus in my book."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been coming here for years and the food and service is always spot on ."}
{"text":"Wishing I got the food other people on here reviewed but unfortunately I don't know what we got. Hardly any cream inside the crab puffs that at first I thought they sent them just fried.  But my son loved them.  The orange chicken wasn't tasteful and the chicken was hard and over cooked and therefor dry.  They got two stars for not messing up rice and for quick delivery. I ordered through Yelp, I did think that was neat.  I'm still questioning if it's really \"chicken\" teriyaki that I'm looking at."}
{"text":"We decided to go here instead of eating out.  We walked in and placed our orders of what we wanted.  I said the house special chicken meal and she ordered the orange chicken meal.  We were pretty specific with what we wanted.  A few times he asked us, but we kept explaining to make sure he got it right...  After paying $40 for the food and walking out, we headed home and opened the food to see that all the orders were wrong.  No house special chicken at all. and the orange chicken could serve a small child only.  Pretty unhappy, we called and they guy on the phone said we didn't order the meals, but only the individual servings.  Are you kidding??   I didn't think this was Panda Express.  They delivered and while we wanted them to do that, I decided I just didn't want to deal with them again.  The food we did eat was ok.. nothing amazing."}
{"text":"Pretty bummed out and I'm in a great mood today.  I feel roobbed. Came in around 7:50 pm (closes at 9:00) and ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl with extra sauce. Was told it be ten minutes or so....people were very nice but that's where it stopped. The  bowl was $5.50, my total was $6.26 since I paid for extra sauce. I got barely any sauce, I got barely any chicken....well, I got chicken but it was inedible pieces I wouldn't even feed the animals. What was supposed to be a bowl with chicken, rice and extra sauce, ended up a rice box with enough teriyaki sauce to possibly fill three thimbles,four if you're lucky and this nasty dry chicken foreign parts that I'm sure get sold for horrible dog food brands. I had to play doctor, add my own sauces at my house and supplying my own chopsticks and napkins also...pretty bummed :("}
{"text":"My wife and i have ordered here twice, first time i wasnt hungry and i didnt order anything but as soon as my wife answered the door i smelt the food and it was amazing. They have an extremely tasty sauce they put on the general tzo that is sooo good. The texture of the chicken is a little chewy and mushy but its not bad at all. Their serving sizes are really large so we actually shared the dinner entree and the rice and made two little dishes out of it. Next time we ordered there the food took an 1 hr 1/2 to arrive, and we had to call 2 times to check where our food was. The owner then said he was going to bring it personally. We live 5 min up the road so we had no idea what happened. I think it was a thursday night. But regardless things do happen the food was good i got the house chicken special and it was really good. Flavors were nice but a little mushy texture. A bit pricey also"}
{"text":"Seriously overpriced Chinese food, which is not as good as any random Chinese buffet food in Phoenix. The fried rice was just way below my expectation. Won't go back even it is a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"I love Golden Rice Express...I've been eating here for like 15 years, the food has always been consistent, generous portions, and darn good!  This place is NOT fancy, (but it is CLEAN) it is a quick sit down place to grab lunch or order take-out for dinner. The prices are very reasonable for the portions. The beef is very tender (most places have chewy or tough beef, NOT here!)  Try any of the entries from the \"Chef's Specials\", many are different stir-fry dishes served over rice or pan-fried noodles. My favorite is the #815 (shrimp with veggies)... for $6.25...WOW! The portion is very generous!   The service is ALWAYS friendly! (which is very rare at Chinese restaurants)...eat here and you'll become a regular!"}
{"text":"How many of you out there are a fan of sweet and sour pork ? You probably then know how its is supposed to look and most importantly how it is supposed to taste. Well the sweet and sour pork I got from this joint tasted like \" a la the old built up grease off the grill\".Look please relize i'm not getting paid for this, therefore would not lie, I call em like i see em in this case like I taste em. When I got home and started grubbing I thought maybe I got caught in a time/space warp continuem or some shit and got the food from Waffle house in 1953.It was barely edible. The vegetables were not crisp and i always thought bell peppers were  med to dark green in color. I ASKED FOR and paid the man for extra vegetables and he acted like he had to put me through college, cmon bell pepper, pineapple, onion, and carrots are cheap I know it and you know it.So on to the special house fried rice....what part of the house did it come from ? Survey said, \" under the house\". I didnt exactly have to fight my way in through the entrance, down one of two lanes and up to counter to place my order. Wasnt anyone there when i arrived as when i left. With that being stated would it place the restaurant in bankruptcy to put a little more meat in the so called \"special house\" rice. Rice is cheaper than a ass kicking. I been up to the asian market, you can buy a 50 lb sack for probably under 20.00. Unless you were a cook in the armed sevices or the midnight mission very few of you all can fathom just how much a 50 lb bag of rice can actually produce. Probably enough to fill the bed of your XL350 OR G3500, I dont really wanna think about it. Anyhow the cook needs to get with that \"brutha\"... what's his name ? Oh yeah Uncle Ben. The texture of the rice was clumpy, for lack of a better world and to me it had no flavor. Lastly, lets talk about the spring rolls. Normally springs that I've bought else where in N. Glendale where inch and half in diameter 4 to 5 inches long. The once i bought from express where big around as your pinky. I could live with the size if they tasted good, again l tasted old grill grease. Probably the worst portion of this whole dining experince was the return. I actually dreaded having to go back because 1- I knew we would communicate poorly and 2- I knew that the man would think I was just trying to get over on him. Being a seeker of truth not always justice I had to go back. I kept it cool as he ran down his speel and we agreed on  HALF ORDER OF EACH to compensate me. A couple of minutes later the lady handed me a bag it contained a pint of fried rice and one packet of soy sauce. Now let's see how your reading absorbtion and comprehension levels are currently ? Do you think I'll be going back to G.R.E. ?"}
{"text":"Not the greatest both greatest. Went there twice and wasdisappointed both times."}
{"text":"They cook the food to order here, you do have to wait a little but it's very worth it. So fresh and authentic.  I usually just get takeout and eat at home. The lo mien is awsome and they take special orders as well for the picky eaters. Very reasonably priced. I wanted to make sure others could see the menu better cause nothing was posted that's clear to read here yet. So here ya go! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Love the fresh steamed broccoli and chicken at this place! The food is always piping hot and neatly packed up when I pick up my to-go order. Food is always ready fast.  The owners are sweethearts too :)"}
{"text":"Ordered food for delivery. The driver came and tried to add more money for an out of area delivery. Their website clearly states we are in their delivery area. I scratched it out and made it the correct price. When we sat down to eat our food I bit into a dumpling and the meat was raw. We were missing food items. The food was terrible I was disgusted. I called back and the \"manager\" called us liars. She was extremely rude. I asked for a full refund and offered to take their food back. They sent a driver to pick it up and when he got here he took the food and called us fat liars. This was the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant. If you want terrible service and possible food poisoning from raw or undercooked food this is your place."}
{"text":"Wanting Chinese delivery bad, I went to the nearest one...that delivered that is. I didn't expect much, even from a place I never ate at before, and not surprisingly, Golden Rice Express didn't let me down.   The food was...okay. I've had better. The shrimp, however, both fried (separately) and within the House Special Combo, was very good. And the delivery was super fast. They said 45 minutes, which didn't shock or disappoint me,  but it took roughly 20 minutes, for which, I tipped bigger. The nice delivery guy said it was slow on that Sunday night. Well, it was slow at my house, as well, or I wouldn't have been ordering the takee outee.  I try to be as detailed as possible, but everything was so average, that I really can't add too much, especially since I didn't visit their establishment.  Overall, if I absolutely must order Chinese food, and I've had a few - i.e. I'm not driving anywhere, including the superior Panda Express, I'll get them again. Only, you should wait until payday. Otherwise, with delivery costs, taxes, tipping and their policy on ordering $15+, you might as well get a payday loan prior to ordering from them."}
{"text":"I used to like the place (a lot). But now they think they can save money by skimping. They used to load up a shrimp dish with shrimp, now though, JUST THREE SHRIMP. I feel cheated an I will never go there again. Do not be a sucker steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"I love Kung pao chicken here. They have authentic menu options and authentic food. It's fast food style so not a huge focus in ambience but food is great, fam owned, Chinese cook!"}
{"text":"My go-to place for Chinese delivery.  I like the 2-item dinner combos.  They have great lo mien, egg foo, and I like their house chicken (I guess similar to General Tso?).    You can eat there, but I would recommend carry out or delivery only."}
{"text":"Very friendly service each time. I'll admit that this isn't my favorite Chinese spot but because they are so warm & hospitable, I'm good with coming back. The lunch specials are cheap, $5.50- $6.50. I've never eaten here for dinner so I cannot say much on that. The lemon and orange chickens are really good without overly heavy sweet sauce. Rice is always perfect. The one time I ordered Lo mein, I thought it was too salty. That being said, I think just about all fast food is too salty. They don't have fountain drinks; instead they offer canned and bottled sodas and teas. If you dine in, they give you a real metal fork to use. Wonderful! (Given my silly phobia of cheap plastic bendable cutlery) ;)"}
{"text":"The worst I have had. Then I read in the New Times they received a D rating on their last inspection. Looked it up and sure enough they did. Never again."}
{"text":"Aviance- 1 or 2 Food 3.5  I loved the egg roll and crab puff. Delish! Sweet and Sour soup was only fair. Not bad and friendly service. Just not a pretty place, maybe more for take out. Cheaper for lunch. If you eat for dinner a bit overpriced."}
