{"text":"My hotel wasn't too far from here, and I didn't feel like grabbing a Taxi, so I zoned in on \"Thai nearby.\"  Upon walking in and seeing that 1) It was ten minutes until 9pm on a Friday and 2) Not a soul was in the place my first thought ran to, \"Bad Sign.\" Then a young lady appeared from the back; I asked if they were open and she said they were taking to go orders. It was Grey Cup Weekend...so maybe football fans don't exactly get into Thai food too much. Who knows?  I went with the Tom Ka soup and Glass Noodles with Shrimp as an entree, prepared extra spicy.   Everything was great! The noodles were bursting with flavor --although not spicy at all despite my request-- and the soup was spot on!  Much much better than the typical Thai Cuisine available in Dallas.   If you are nearby, and aren't too much of a Thai Food snob, this place is sure to please!"}
{"text":"Used to be clean, now dirty.  My girlfriend and I sat down at the table and the first thing I noticed was dirty cutlery waiting on a clean napkin to be used!  I went to switch it with another set on the table and it was dirty too.  Unwashed, sticky with food on it.  Not run through the dishwasher with spots, actually unwashed with sticky food.  The waitress was embarrassed, apologized and took them away.  The Hot and sour soup was 6 out of 10, as it had too much broth.  My girlfriend's soup had pieces of vegetable that looked old and one of the dumplings tasted flat out bad.  She was sick later with the trots.  Coincidence.  Most likely not.  Not a good experience and not what I remember form a couple of years ago."}
{"text":"The vegetarian dishes I ordered were great. No ambiance No Music so I was a little bored listening to the chatter of tables beside me. The vegetarian food I ordered was very good so yes I would go back but probably for take out......"}
{"text":"Absolute fantastic, very friendly service, super clean, good menu. You have to try 'Magic Pad Thai' with a Singha Beer. Very authentic food with good quality for normal prices."}
{"text":"I sort of accidentally ate at Galangal last night. We were trying to go to the Thai place that used to be at this address, but it's closed and Galangal is the new thing. I always approach things with \"fusion\" in the name with a great deal of suspicion, but we were hungry and lazy, so we stayed for dinner anyway.  Dinner reinforced my fusion skepticism. The space is nice enough - clean, nicely decorated (Thai theme, obviously). Our server was accommodating and trying really hard, but still managed to mix up drink orders, leave us sitting with empty glasses, and wait far too long to do a quality check (which left me sitting far too long without the hot sauce I desperately needed to add to my food).   The food was meh. I started with spring rolls - which were deep fried and fine, but definitely not impressive. For dinner I ordered a noodle dish with beef and Thai brocolli - which arrived as a mushy pile of noodles (and a small pile, at that) with a few limp pieces of green stuff mixed in. It was nicely flavoured, but disappointing. And, despite the fact that I requested it extra spicy, it was bland bland bland. My friend's pad thai looked like it had more character than my dish, and she said it was ok, but neither of us was particularly impressed."}
{"text":"As a repeat customer for a long time, I returned recently to find the restaurant is under new management. This is a new change, and maybe part of my disappointments will be improved as the new staff get used to the recipes and dishes.   Now, the food is still good, but it's just not the same. The Massaman beef had no potatoes in it, there was overall less bamboo shoots in every dish, not a single pepper in each dish (which I actually liked), and the ingredients didn't seem as choice as they used to be, for instance the chinese broccoli in the pad see ew was mainly broccoli stalks. The pad thai that used to be covered with a delicate lattice of fried egg, was practically wrapped in an omelette.   Overall this was a disappointment to me when compared to what this restaurant used to provide for, let's be honest, a couple dollars per dish more than many other thai restaurants in the area. My previous review described this place as incredibly authentic, and right now, while the food was still tasty, it's just not the same. I hope that this is just growing pains and the new management will get in sync with the menu and thai flavours and presentation soon."}
{"text":"Comment dire. Nous avons découvert ce restaurant un peu par hasard quand nous avons rencontré les propriétaires au détour de nos déplacements en région. Curieux, nous avons décidé de rendre visite afin de saluer l'initiative de ces deux jeunes qui se sont lancés à la conquête de la cuisine thaïlandaise.   Ce fut une grande déception. Ces jeunes, ni-l'un ni l'autre étant d'origine thaïlandaise, semblaient ne rien connaître à la cuisine outre une connaissance superficielle de leur propre menu. Quand nous avons demandé à l'un des propriétaires de nous faire une recommandation, nous avons eu droit à un 'tout est bon' ...   Notre repas fut très inégal, de qualité moyenne et sans aucune passion. Nous sommes partis déçus, notamment du fait qu'aucune réduction ne fut proposée pour un plat particulièrement insatisfaisant."}
{"text":"Since we moved to the downtown east side area we've been testing out all the Thai restaurants that are within delivery distance. Sorry to tell you that this rated the worst for both of us. We ordered the red curry beef, pineapple rice and chicken pad thai. Verdict? Lousy, lousy flavour."}
{"text":"During Friday lunch, my co-workers and I walked over to this place for a team lunch after hearing glowing recommendations about their Thai food. When we got to the place, we saw a government notice on the door ordering for restaurant closure.. no wonder they weren't picking up their phone.  Not sure if we dodged a bullet here!"}
{"text":"As far as Thai food goes this one is fairly good.  I'm writing this review specifically to review their pumpkin soup. I wish I could order this by the gallon. It is amazing. We go there especially for this soup. I suppose Thai pumpkin soup should be spicy.  This is not but I simply do not care. It's wonderful! Go get some!  Forgot to mention - they have renamed this Ah Nam. Same food. Same super sweet waitress."}
{"text":"Finally! A legit, authentic Thai restaurant.  The place recently opened in Feb 2011 and is co-owned by two sisters and a friend, all chefs originally from Thailand.  I went in on a whim and was blown away.  Everything was so flavorful and tasty.    I went with Tom Kah (Coconut) soup to start, very delicious with a hint of lime.  Then ordered their Magic Pad Thai - the dish was cooked to perfection, the noodles were cooked properly (soaked beforehand) and the sauce had just a touch of heat.  Finally for dessert, the mango mousse, which was out of this world.  Oh and their prices are very reasonable.  I highly recommend this place and will be coming back for more..."}
{"text":"Overall I wasn't impressed.  The service was wonderful, but the food was terrible (and there was no soap in the bathroom, which always sketches me out).  The service was great. Very attentive and friendly, but regardless of the quality of service if I go out to eat I'd like to have a good meal. Nothing tasted homemade. I might as well have bought something from the frozen food aisle and reheated it myself. With the hundreds and hundreds of restaurants in Toronto to choose from, I don't see any reason to return to this one."}
{"text":"I ordered from Galangal this evening.  About $40 worth of food after tax: Seafood red Thai curry, Magic Pad Thai and Tamarin chicken.  Ordered for pick up.  The good thing is they throw in free spring rolls for orders over $30.  Unfortunately, they weren't very good at all (no taste).  More importantly, they stuffed up the order and gave us chicken red thai  curry AND sea food red thai curry.  I only found out by the time we drove home.  Very unsatisfactory. Called to complain; the guy said he would ask the manager about what they could do and call me back (I gave my details).  Surprise, surprise the manager did not call back.  The food is also very ordinary for Thai food.  Nearby Golden Thai is better, but it is also overpriced and the portions are small...."}
{"text":"They seem to have inconsistencies with what is described on the menu and what they actually make. I've been here twice and have tried to order something heathful that has come out much differently than described on the menu.   My first time here, I ordered a salmon and rice dish that had a convenient picture of the presentation of the plate on the menu. It came out looking completely different and was not what I was expecting-as I was looking for a healthy dish, and it turned out to be fried rice with no vegetables (exactly the opposite of what was pictured in the menu).   The second time, I ordered a shrimp salad. On the menu, the shrimp was described as 'grilled' but when placed in front of me, it was tempura battered and deep fried. Again, I had been looking for a healthy option and this was the exact opposite.   Also, there was no soap in the bathroom, which grossed me out.   However, I will admit, their chicken satay appetizer was fantastic. The peanut sauce is sweet, spicy and savoury. In addition, the service is friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a chance due to its convenient location and the fact that it opened fairly recently (Feb. 2011). When I'm in this part of town, I usually go to Golden Thai, or sometimes Mengrai. But my DC and I didn't have that much time and I thought this place would be a bit cheaper and faster, because it seems more casual. In the end, I won't likely come back here. The prices are on par with Golden Thai, but the food quality is definitely subpar.   PROS:  - Clean, simple decor  - Not busy (not really a \"pro\", but at least it was easy to get a table on a weekend) - Sweet server (my DC spilled a tiny bit of soup on the table while pouring, and she came over with a washcloth to wipe it up without us asking)  - First Thai restaurant I've seen that has a kids menu. Cute.  - Menu has photos of every dish  CONS:  - Food is overall unremarkable: bland pad thai, 'meh' green curry chicken that was low on vegetables. The fresh rolls were okay though. Banana spring rolls with chocolate was just weird and really oily.  - Not authentic at all.    ETC: - Weird \"fusion\" dishes on menu, e.g. stir-fry pasta (fusili)  - 10% off if you pay cash  I really like to support newly opened businesses that are just getting started, but unfortunately I can't get behind this place."}
{"text":"I'd recommend this place for lunch. For $10 you get a saucy thai dish, a spring roll, and hot and sour soup. Great value and pretty tasty. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"VIBE  I was hungry. And I was craving something savoury so since this place was a new discovery, I decided to try it. There was one couple in the restaurant at around 5:30.   Service was welcoming and friendly. That said, they should have been a bit more attentive. I spilled pop on the table and wiped it with my napkin. They noticed the dirty napkin on the table and I even put my empty coke can and napkin wrapper beside it and it wasn't gone. Not a big deal, but come on!   I ATE  The Magic Pad Thai. If it ain't made by David Copperfield, it's not magic. In fact, it had no flavour whatsoever and only two pieces of lemongrass. So much so that I had to ask for salt and pepper on my pad thai. I felt awful but it was not good! I don't even think the shrimp was fully cooked. (You know when something has a frozen taste to it?). Oy. I even told the waitress/owner this. They were very receptive to the feedback, however. And they gave me extra peanut sauce (extra peanut sauce is always a good thing).   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  I wonder if M.I.A would eat here because she sang a song called \"Galang. Galang.\" Things that make you go hmmm. Also Urban Dictionary defines \"galang\" as \"go along.\" Interesting interpretation. http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=galang  If you're interested, here's Wikipedia's version for \"Galangal\": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galangal  That said, I won't be \"galanging\" back here any time soon. I think Khao San Road has spoiled me for life."}
{"text":"This place has weird hours! Sometimes it's open on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, and sometimes its not. The sign at the window with their hours on it has no bearing on the hours they actually operate."}
{"text":"Service was extremely friendly but... I ordered the Tom Yum soup with shrimp (my complaint here is the shrimp still has the tail shells on and for a soup this makes things a bit difficult). I had the Masaman curry lamb for my main dish and the potatoes were, how is this possible?, dry. The awkward thing about the service, however, was the waiter coming to the table and seemingly not knowing how to place to the food at the table with the different plates in play."}
{"text":"We went before a concert at the ACC. We chose it because of its convenient location. Neat decor.   We advised the waiter that we were in a hurry. They don't mess around - the food came within ten minutes of us placing the order. My companion had the Pad Thai, while I enjoyed the sweet and sour pork. They were both delicious.  Not sure if I would choose this place amongst all other Thai spots, but it was just fine for a pre-event meal. We left the car parked nearby and walked to the ACC, so we only paid for parking once."}
