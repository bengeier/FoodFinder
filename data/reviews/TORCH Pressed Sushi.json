{"text":"Find a new sushi place?just in front of the bus station of everyday i pass. Today i decide to walk in and try?Very nice and clean place. Staff are friendly? good time to try their buy one get one free promotion now till the end of December. i am sure will come back? looking forward to have more promotions."}
{"text":"This is the best pressed sushi place in North York period. We were walking towards Daldongee kbbq restaurant when I noticed the pressed sushi takeout spot.  From their diagrams, they looked pretty intricate like ones you find in Miku. Naturally I wanted to try this place out.  A week later, I came back with my wife and tried every piece on their menu.   Pricing was reasonable for the quality. They tasted as good as they looked.  My personal favorites were Red Snapper, Salmon and Tuna.  I will definitely be back. You can get great pressed sushi as partial of the price you pay at Miku and get 90 percent of its quality.  It's a definite must in the neighbourhood. I'd recommend getting 2 pieces of each item on the menu."}
{"text":"Came in on a weekday with a friend, and while it's mainly a takeout place, there are still a few seats to sit at if you want to eat in. We got the tuna and the spicy salmon sushi. Both were delicious and came with miso soup, a salad and a drink. While delicious, it was a bit pricier than expected at $12.95 for 6 pieces. But the staff were super friendly and the fish was good, so I can't really complain!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like torch pressed sushi? It's great to have @torchpressedsushi so close to home. Oshizushi means 'pressed sushi' which originated from Osaka. Our favourite is the torched red snapper pressed sushi (left) with tempura shrimp, tempura crab sticks inside, top with tobiko (fish eggs) and torched to perfection. The rice ratio to the red snapper was well balanced. Service was very friendly and everything were made to order. We found the rice was a bit hard to our liking and the mayo on the shrimp pressed sushi was a bit overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Fought through a snowstorm to get takeout, but it was well worth it! It smells a-m-a-z-i-n-g as soon as you step inside. We got the unagi, shrimp, spicy salmon, and snapper, and all were very good. It's a little pricey for every day eating, but is worth the splurge once in a while."}
{"text":"TORCH is a small walk-in spot on Yonge, featuring torched pressed sushi and poke bowls. Although intended for take-out, there are a few stools and tables available for dine-in.   My bf and I decided to visit and take advantage of the last day of their soft-opening BOGO special (buy 6pcs pressed sushi, get 6pcs free / buy a poke bowl, get a bowl free).  For two, we ordered 24pcs of torched pressed sushi: 12 spicy salmon, 6 unagi, 3 red snapper, 3 tuna. We also got 2 miso soups for free with our order. The ratio of fish to rice was perfect, and the combination of ingredients used for each selection was well-paired. I would prefer less mayo for both the tuna and red snapper, as it overpowered the fish. Regardless, it was seared to perfection, fresh and delicious overall.   Despite the long 40min+ wait, the owner was sincerely apologetic with customers, and patient and helpful with other staff. The meal was well worth our time and money, as it seemed they placed customer service and quality of food over speed and volume of orders. Will be back to try their poke bowls!  Note: there are very limited parking spots available! We had to park elsewhere and walk over in this freezing weather."}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to drop by this place to try out their torched sushi. It's a very small place with 10 spots to eat there. Most of the customers called ahead or ordered online for takeout.  It was an okay experience but based on the previous reviews, I was expecting more.    Food: Based on the previous reviews, I was disappointed. I ordered the torched salmon sushi, spicy salmon rice bowl and yam banana torch sushi. Sushi orders are made fresh as you order. The quality was okay but not as spectacular as some of the reviewers describe it to be. For this price, I could go to other places with better seating and more quantity. The torched salmon flavour was not enough.  Also, the spicy salmon bowl tasted the same as my regular salmon sushi,  no spiciness which is strange. The yam banana torched sushi was better, taste complemented well together and unique."}
{"text":"It's a small place, bright and clean, with about 8 stools for sitting. Had the salmon and unagi which came with a free pop and soup takeout. Not the cheapest place to eat at but quality is great and both were simply melt-in-your-mouth goodness. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The storefront is very very small and has seating for less than 8 people. This was annoying as it was hard to sit and eat and the open concept space meant that the fumes from the torching was very strong.  In terms of food, I've had much better aburi oshi (blowtorched, pressed sushi) at both a much higher price point ($17 for 6 pieces at Miku) and a much lower price point ($14 for 10 pieces at Arisu). Here, it was very expensive. 6 pieces cost $16 after tax and my friend who got 9 spent over $24. There was a very thick layer of sauce which made it creamy but the fish itself (we tried salmon, tuna and shrimp) was left raw and completely uncooked."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place I have been in toronto. They poped up on my social media and it looks very fancy so I decide to give them a try. I usually don't like eat raw food but their torched sushi impressed me.  My favorite one is the spicy salmon. Salmon was extremely fresh and thick for each piece. I also try other torched sushi and I end up eating 18 piece in total. Their price is not cheap but totally worth in. I wish they will open one in downtown soon."}
{"text":"good sushi like the shrimp one a little bit expensive dont have sashimi to eat"}
{"text":"Haven't been to THE actual store because I always order from uber.  Food is always fresh and their staff is so nice. They actually called us and told us about how our order was not correct. Apparently my boyfriend didn't want mayonnaise......Because he was afraid that it would fatten him up... this is completely our problem but they still tried to explain to us whyvmayonnaise couldn't be waived."}
{"text":"One day I pass by here and went in to buy take out. It was incredible! It's really surprised me. A small restaurant and make a very high standard. Very impressive! Keep the good work!"}
{"text":"Must Try: Torched Salmon, Tempura Shrimp, Torched Tuna, Torched Fantastic Four, Torched Surimi   Rating: (10/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (10/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness  My Experience:    An amazing little spot on Yonge, that focuses on quality above all else. Came here and was captivated by the minimalist and clean restaurant. They had some in-house seats, but mainly works as a take-out spot.   We tried all the sushi options, and all of them were delicious, with a few stand out stars. The fish was fresh, the torch was just right and the ingredients works together perfectly. Although we didn't try a Torch Bowl, I have no doubt those too would also be delicious.   Being innovators, they have recently added a torch sandwich, which I am excited to try on my next visit.   Torch is definitely premium, so the sushi is a bit more expensive than normal, but what you pay for the quality you receive.   This Walt Disney quote sums up TORCH perfectly: \"Whatever you do, do it well. Do it so well that when people see you do it, they will want to come back and see you do it again, and they will want to bring others and show them how well you do what you do.\""}
{"text":"Everything we ordered tasted very good. Rich and flavourful. Will for sure come again if nearby!"}
{"text":"So really very YUMMY!!! Ordered surimi+tempura. It`s very unique sushi 'sandwich'. Real delish!!  and fantastic torch sushi, and spicy salmon torch sushi are also delish. The place does not have many sushi selections. But they are top quality!"}
{"text":"Although the food is pretty good, I find the location a bit deterring.   The sushi was pretty good, but definitely on the more expensive end for something that's fast casual. I've been loving torched sushi ever since I had Aburi at Miku. The torched salmon (12.65/6 pieces) was good, hard to go wrong, while the tempura shrimp was alright and not too exciting - however I really liked the aburi salmon bowl.   What I got (in photos) was good for two people.   There's not a lot of sitting area, so it's more of a quick and easy meal. There's a few bar stools. Not really somewhere you'd go a sit down meal.   It's just south of Yonge and Steele's, which means that parking is a bit limited, there's a few spots around the corner and directly to the right of it. If you go during a peak time such as weekend at dinner you might be out of luck and have to park further (maybe the Tim Hortons lot a bit further south)"}
{"text":"TORCH showed up on just about all my social platforms. Eventually, I gave in and went to try on their last day of the BOGO promo.   Did it live up to the hype? Ehhhh. It was okay.   Staff was friendly, parking is a disaster.   It's good but given their price point, I wasn't blown away.   We ordered 24pcs in total, varying in: - Spicy Salmon - Salmon - Unagi - Red Snapper - Tempura Shrimp  (We didn't get any pop or salad that's included in the 12 PC promos)  The best? Spicy Salmon/Salmon. This was definitely the most flavorful. The worst? Tempura Shrimp. Like another reviewer, I found it unique at first, as you don't usually see this in pressed sushi. However, in tasting it, it fell behind. It's literally tempura shrimp on rice.   I would also suggest opting out on the Unagi. Seeing as how Unagi is already cooked, torching it didn't do anything for its flavour profile. Unfortunately, it tasted like regular Unagi nigiri to us, and definitely not worth the premium.   What you also won't be thrilled about? The wait. We arrived at 4, to find them CLOSED until 4:30. TORCH had closed to take their lunch and prep for future orders.   I get it? We were lucky to have a car to wait in, but I feel for those who traveled all the way there without a vehicle, to wait in the cold or be turned away.  Even after they reopened, they took 3 orders of 12-24pcs and all others had to wait an additional 30 minutes. People weren't ordering party trays (that I'd understand).  DEFINITELY call ahead.   Would I go back? Probably not.  It's a unique takeout place, but on top of the price, the wait isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Ordered the spicy salmon bowl.. it was alright. Definitely not spicy at all and lacking flavour imo. I would just stick with their torched sushi next time. It came with a miso soup, which was very regular, honestly was expecting something more unique as they seem to advertise quality food. Service was friendly and the place is very small, definitely a takeout place.  Generally their prices are on the higher range, but that's the standard price for torched sushi anyways. But 3 pieces of sushi for $7... So figure. I do like the tuna aburi though. Very flavorful and addicting. Would come back if I want to splurge a bit and not have to drive to Miku or something."}
{"text":"I love pressed sushi and I was so excited to try this place! The prices are as expected, pretty average with other places.  The quality is not as good as other pressed sushi that I've had, I don't think my sushi was torched enough. The rice was also a little soggy and the sushi kept falling apart. However the service is so so so nice and the people working there are so friendly.   I was a little disappointed with the quality since my expectations were so high. I really did think this would be my new go-to spot. It is also REALLY hard to get parking, we had to circle around a few times."}
{"text":"Tired of having to go to jabistro or MIKU for your luxury pressed rolls?? (Aburiscious plz) then swing by TORCH...  Insane attention to detail, (down to little seasoned seaweed flakes on the bottom of the unagi roll which hits your tongue as nom down!), great flavours and lots of great comps (yelp checkin for drink, providing free miso soups because I wasn't alone) makes it a worthwhile visit.   Rolls are expensive though - just like the high end places downtown, however the flavours are competitive. For $6.75 you can nab three pieces of spicy salmon sushi.   TLDR; I know I will have fully embodied/achieved the Canadian dream when I can eat here without having to calculate $/per sushi."}
{"text":"Incredible hidden gem in North York! This is without a doubt the best pressed sushi north of the city and at a reasonable price given the superb quality and unique flavors. The fish to rice ratio is perfect, the rice is fluffy and tasty and the fish is super fresh and juicy. My mouth is watering just thinking of the lunch I had earlier this week. My favorite is the snapper, followed closely by the salmon and shrimp. Highly recommended and will return soon!"}
{"text":"I like the food - warm, crispy tasty. they offered some great deals for the customers. The only thing I would suggest to the business is to avoid arguing with the staff when you have customers eating in front of you. Its a common sense-it doesnt make good impression."}
{"text":"TORCH is a small little shop located on a very multicultural Yonge St.  Went in with my girlfriend on a cold, Saturday night.  Seems to be Chinese-run and not Japanese, but don't let that turn you away.  The food will speak for itself.  They were quite busy and understaffed, with three staff preparing food, and one, presumably the owner, running the till.  As the name suggests, it features an array of torched, pressed sushi (aburi oshizushi), as well as poke bowls.  My girlfriend and I arrived on the last day for their opening promo: a generous buy one get one free deal; that is, buy a bowl, get another bowl free, or buy 6 pcs, get another 6 pcs free.    When we arrived at around 6:45 PM, we were told there would be at least a 30-minute wait for the food due to a backup with orders, which we didn't mind.  In hindsight, it seemed like nothing, considering people after us were told they would have to wait upwards of 45 minutes to an hour, and eventually later customers were politely turned away entirely.    We ordered 12 pcs of spicy salmon, 6 pcs of unagi, 3 pcs of red snapper, and 3 pcs of tuna.  Everything was made to order and tasted delicious.  Each piece had very good presentation and you can definitely taste and feel the texture of each ingredient they put into every piece.  The sauces had really good flavour; my only complaint was that, at times, it seemed to overwhelm the taste of the fish.  All in all though, a great meal and well worth the wait.  The prices can get a bit steep, however, with the promotion coming to an end.  For 24 pcs of torched sushi ringing in around a $30 bill, it was well worth the money and left our bellies full.  But without the promotion, it would cost much more and definitely turn away some customers.  With other options available across the GTA for a similar regular price, it will be interesting to see how they do in the future, considering their location and customer target.  Hopefully they will have more promotions in the new year.  Will definitely come back to try their poke bowls in the future.  A side note: The man who ran the till, presumably the owner, was very pleasant and patient with the customers and communicative with staff.  Always a nice thing to see at any business."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the torch bowls. Got a torched spicy salmon and a poke bowl. Both were really delicious. I really enjoyed the torch salmon one. The torched sushi really brought out the flavour of the salmon. One thing I didn't like is that the rice of both bowls was a tad too sweet for me and eventually made the bowl a little too much sweetness. But in general it was good and I would go again."}
{"text":"The restaurant is geared for takeout since there are only a handful of stools and stool tables that you can eat on if you were to dinner in the restaurant. Parking is also scarce if you're planning on driving to the location, so be wary of this when stopping by (there are only 4-5 parking spots in front of the store).  As for the sushi, the taste is ok for the price. The rice was nice and flavorful and not overdone. I had ordered the torched spicy salmon and the torched tuna. The torched spicy salmon had a nice balance between the fish and the slightly charred spicy mayo on top.  The same could also be said for the torched tuna, the wasabi mayo compliments the tuna's flavor.  You also get a side of miso soup, which is a very nice touch.  Overall though, I would probably rate this higher if it weren't for the price and the portions. The portions, in my opinion, are too small and the price is too steep for the amount of food that you are getting.  The otherwise great sushi is overshadowed by the high cost and small portions."}
{"text":"Second time at this place. First time was when they first opened and I must give 5 stars. My coworker and I decided to come here for weekday lunch despite the commute. Well, it's torched sushi and there's none in Markham, so why not! It's a small shop and most people order take out but there's still some bar table seating.  They ordered the spicy salmon poke bowl but I hardly eat spicy so I ordered the torched sushi. I ordered the shrimp, unagi, salmon and tuna. All of these were finished within seconds. Really good flavour for all, nice balance and blend for all the ingredients, and surprising it's pretty filling. Unagi is my favourite. I was convinced by friend to have some spicy salmon poke bowl, for those who cannot take spicy, it's acceptable level of spice if you want to try.  I must say it's a brilliant idea to have torched sushi without breaking the bank! It's affordable price. Looking forward to their new menu!"}
{"text":"Cute petite jap restaurant mainly catered to takeout. There are bar seats that could prob seat approx 10-12 people. Clean and minimalist decor. Enjoyed the spicy salmon torched bowl & their torched red snapper sushi the most. Overall good decent pressed sushi. Price point is relatively high but good for a quick bite when you are craving for jap fix. Friendly staff as well. Do not recommend the yam&banana, tempura shrimp and the torched tuna."}
{"text":"Have been meaning to try this place out for a while.  It did not disappoint! Great tasting flavors and very fresh.  The service was very quick friendly and efficient as well!"}
{"text":"Pressed sushi is one of the new food trends of 2017 that I love.   There is no better place to enjoy the trend than this place.   Innovative recipes at reasonable prices. Super nice staff.   The only downside is that the seating area is small, but it's easy enough to order takeout and enjoy the food at home if you have a large group."}
{"text":"Visited Sat Feb 17.  I wouldn't think that sushi pressed into rectangles and torched would taste good, but the quality is very good. They seem to be doing a lot of takeout business.    Pros Ordered red snapper, tempura shrimp, yum & banana and spicy salmon bowl which were very flavourful and fresh.     Cons  Parking very hard to find in this area. Not sure how they can fix this problem. Seating for only 6 to 8 people on counter seating.   Messing with individual soy sauce packets and wood chopsticks is a bit messy.  High prices make this not worth the money $2 to $3 per piece.   Protip - Get a free pop for checking in on Yelp.   Damage $43 for 12 pieces of sushi and a sushi bowl."}
{"text":"This is a new 10 seater, fast food style pressed sushi. The salmon ones were okay. But 12 pieces and the bill came to approx $29, I thought the prices was a bit steep. They should have combo instead. The sauce tasted good but the rice was a little too moist. Very friendly and helpful service."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! Definitely one of the best sushi I've ever had! It's not the cheapest but worth your money."}
{"text":"While the quality cannot compare to Jabistro or Miku, price is better and does the job for satisfying torched sushi cravings. We got the sushi combo set and all the flavours were great! Spicy salmon was the crowd favourite. Note that the place is kind of small; good for takeout but limited seating for dine-in."}
{"text":"pros: tastes awsome in general. Nice interior and great service. cons:price to portion size is not the best. only eat here if your looking for a snack and nothing more. inside is small and not for groups."}
{"text":"The food was quite good but what really stood out at TORCH was the impeccable service. Orders came out quickly and our server (and presumed owner) was very accommodating and friendly. The sushi and dons were tasty and priced accordingly but what will keep me coming back is the amazing staff."}
{"text":"Best new pressed sushi in town! Great for take out not so much for dine in as there is only a handful of seats. We tried most of the pressed sushi flavour and the torched salmon poke bowl. Our faves were the red snapper, shrimp and spicy salmon pressed sushi. Delicious and quick service if you order takeout. Staff were also super friendly. I would most likely pass on the torched salmon poke bowl next time, nothing special and kind of bland.   Tip: order 12 piece pressed sushi and get a miso soup and seaweed salad for free! Also can check in on yelp to get a free pop! Why not ? ;)"}
{"text":"Good ..owner provides excellent customer service   Got the 12 piece ...came with salad miso and pop....totals is $32 ...but price depends on which sushi you get ....minimum 3 PC for each type of sushi   Got the unagi ...torched spicy ...tuna ...and fantastic four"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and decided to give this a try. When I arrived, they were backloged with orders but not many people waiting. It could be due to soft opening and their bogo offer this month. I decided to order the poke bowl while my friend ordered the spicy torched salmon for takeout.  The wait was 30 min but we were warned beforehand. Seems like they are need to reduce the menu selection or get more efficient. In terms of the poke bowl, it was average with salmon and tuna plus a variety of toppings on white rice. My friend was disappointed with his since it only had torched salmon on sushi rice.   Not sure if I would return if they wait is that long and they dont improve on the bowls. There is parking in the plaza but very inconvenient location especially for people without cars."}
{"text":"Seating at on high top counter style, place looks simple and clean. Their utensils and soy sauce are placed in a wooden organizer. They have light and regular soy sauce packets also wasabi packets.  I got the M.A.S bowl and just like the name I had the most mangos, avocados & cucumbers and very little Salmon. I wished they had more salmon.   Their torched sushi was good. We got the salmon and tuna.  FYI yelp check in back get you a free drink!"}
{"text":"Wow!!  Just wow!  It's a tiny little take out restaurant with some bar chairs and counters to eat.  Nothing here is Pre made.  Everything is made fresh to order.  The rice tastes like it is from a high end expensive sushi bar.  Perfectly seasoned!!   The torched sushi has that delicious bbq flavour.  Very unique.   The menu is small, but unique.   Came in to try a few pieces as people were talking about it and left saying that we will be back for sure.   Some of the best sushi that we have had (we are huge sushi buffs) Well done!!"}
{"text":"I went to Torch on 12/30 before the BOGO free offer expired. I'm so glad I did because I'm not sure if I'd pay full price at TORCH and not because the service is lacking nor because the quality is subpar. Both are great but to pay 20 bucks for 6 pieces of sushi to me is not worth it.  I got the regular shrimp, the tempura shrimp, the snapper, and the spicy salmon. The only one I thought was meh was the tempura shrimp because it wasn't as crispy as I wanted my tempura to be.  I like the regular shrimp one a lot because it has a burst of freshness from all the lime zest. It really helps to cut some of that butteriness and richness from the spicy salmon and snapper. There's even filling in the pressed rice like shrimp tempura, avocado, and imitation crab meat which takes their pressed sushi to the next level.  There aren't many seats inside the establishment so it's better to order it to go. If you're driving to TORCH, there aren't many parking spots available in the parking lot and once you back out of the tiny parking lot you're on Yonge St. It's better to park on the side streets."}
{"text":"To start: The food here is delicious.  I've gotten from this place a few times during their opening special and I think the food is fantastic.  They've definitely created a menu that is well thought out, with some really amazing flavours.  And the staff (I think the owner - usually the main guy you talk with) is really nice and friendly.  A few of my favourites that I would recommend: - Red Snapper - Tuna - Unagi - Tempura Shrimp  They are really great at adding those little touches like Yuzu mayo, lime zest, black pepper that really show how well crafted the food is.  My one gripe is that it's really quite expensive, especially for this type of take-out place.  There's only a few seats at a bench table, so you're expecting more of a take-out price.  The sushi itself is quite small, so you would need at least 12 pieces for a meal (and you would still feel hungry) - but that's about $25 dollars.  I think I'm really looking at $50-60 for a 2 person meal, that we are taking out, in a white plastic bag, plastic containers, plastic forks, and wooden chopsticks.  It's a tad much, and not sure if those prices are really going to cut it in this neighbourhood.  Sure, I know you need to pay for quality, but still... finding it difficult to justify that cost... and will probably not be a regular thing."}
{"text":"Best torched sushi around the area. I would rank this second (or maybe on par) with Miku.   Unfortunately this place caters more to take out as they have very limited space.  Price is a bit high in my opinion but the quality makes up for it.  Will definitely visit again (and have so for many times)."}
{"text":"The sushi here is fresh - they make it right in front of you!  It's a TINY spot with just a few bar/counter seats so plan on take-out.  Best to park on the side street or better yet in the plaza across the street.  I ordered the torched spicy salmon; torched red snapper and the torched shrimp based on the previous reviews I read.  I wish the spciy salmon was a bit more spicy, but everything tasted fresh and delicious.  the best part is you can order in 3 pieces or 6 pieces of a particular kind of sushi so it let's you try out a variety.  It isn't particularly cheap but it's very good.  Service is super friendly.  I had to wait about 15 minutes for my order (was told of this when I ordered so not an issue at all).  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Tiny hole in the wall that's definitely worth trying. I've been hard to find a place for poke bowls north of Finch and was excited to hear that Torch had poke bowls in addition to their pressed sushi.   Heads up - this place has super difficult parking and can only really fit around 8 people total for sitting in. I would recommend coming with one or two other people or taking it to go. Parking - we parked at the Tim Hortons plaza across the street and jay-walked. The interior is super simple and minimalist with mainly white decor and high bar seating - one row faces the windows and the other faces the kitchen. The owner is super friendly and was open to feedback on his food, which is always nice to see.   I ordered the poke bowl with spicy mayo sauce as well and since it's torched sushi, I had to try the torched tuna (I got the set of 3). Total, it came out to $23.55 for the two orders together and it was definitely worth it. The poke bowl had a perfect ratio of toppings to rice and all the flavours were so well balanced. The sushi was phenomenal and I haven't had torched sushi like that before. Sometimes, I find torched sushi to have too much sauce or to be too torched where it doesn't preserve the rawness of the sushi, but this was a perfect mix of rawness, torched-ness(?), sauce, and rice. It melted in my mouth and it made me want to try the other ones.  I will definitely be back here - though I might subway/bus/walk so that I don't have to deal with the parking."}
{"text":"WHAT I GOT: - Torched Salmon, Torched Unagi, Torched Red Snapper, and Torched Tuna. A promotion of buying 12 pieces led to an additional salad, soup, and pop for free.  TASTE: [4/5] - I'm a big fan of blow torched sushi and pressed sushi. I liked how their menu had options I haven't seen at other sushi restaurants. Each type tasted unique and my favourite had to be the Torched Salmon and Torched Red Snapper. Both had toppings and sauces that complemented the torched flavour. Additional ingredients were tucked away inside each pressed sushi which kept every bite interesting and flavourful. The Torched Unagi also had an interesting seaweed seasoning on the bottom of each piece.  PRESENTATION: [4/5] - At first I was questioning why it took about 10 minutes to make 12 pieces of sushi but once they came out, I found that each type of pressed sushi looked unique and skillfully assembled.  SERVICE: [5/5] - The cashier was attentive to the details of my order and kept me updated on how soon our food would come. He also went out of his way to provide additional servings of the sides (e.g. salad and soup) for my partner and other guests in the restaurant. But wait there is more, they ran out of simple salad but made and offered us seaweed salad instead. They went above and beyond for us and other guests in the restaurant.  THE LAST WORD:  - I would come here if you like blowtorched sushi and pressed sushi. TORCH has types of sushi you won't find at other restaurants and therefore deserves a visit. Expect friendly service, beautiful pressed sushi, and interesting flavours with every bite."}
{"text":"I got 12 pieces with 3 torched unagi, 3 torched spicy salmon, 3 torched tuna and 3 shrimp tempura. It comes with a salad, a miso soup and a pop.  2 out of 3 sushis had their fish slightly burnt. Apparently, the sushi chef didn't not top enough sauce/cream was one of the reasons, not good at controlling the flame is another one. I was going to give it a one star, considering this was the worst torched sushi I have had, but the service was pretty good for a place meant to be for take-out."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! I am a big fan of pressed sushi and this place definitely satisfied the craving. Came to Toronto for a short family visit and was by the Yonge and Finch area so decided to give this place a try. I thoroughly enjoyed all the pressed sushi (torched spicy salmon, red snapper, torched tuna and torched shrimp) we ordered. Service was friendly, restaurant was clean, and flavours that rivalled Miku & Minami (Vancouver). Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. It's been 2 months already, their food is still in good standard. I hope next time I come back, it will be the same or better."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and service!!!   We arrived around 1:15pm on a Friday. The place is pretty tiny, but only about half the seats were filled. However, there did seem to be a lot of customers getting take out, so they were also busy fulfilling those orders.  The wait time for food is absolutely worth it. The staff make each order fresh on the spot. I would sacrifice time for high-quality food, and with the open kitchen, you can watch each step in the process.  They had a \"buy one get one\" deal going on, so my friend and I ordered two poke bowls and two 6-piece rolls for about $28:      - torched spicy salmon bowl      - poké bowl      - torched unagi      - torched red snapper The bowls are a little smaller than other poké bowls I've tried, but it ended up being a solid amount of food for two people. Sushi was torched to perfection, and the bowls tasted delicious as well.   The boss was quite attentive to us throughout our meal, and didn't seem to mind that we spent around two hours eating and chatting. The restaurant became quite empty after 2:30pm.   Right before we left, a photographer came in and appeared to be working with the boss on some promotional material, so keep an eye out for those! Would highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"I went here a month or so ago with my dad and we ordered 1 salmon bowl, 1 eel, and 1 poké. What drew me to this place was the name. I was actually really craving torched sushi and they happened to have it right next to Finch! The website really sold me on the place. It's done superbly and looks gorgeous. My favorite was the salmon, the fish melted in my mouth and it paired amazingly with the seasoned rice. Also tasted yummy with the miso soup. The poké was my next favorite. It's very colourful and you can choose from many sauces to have on it. I think we got the spicy mayo. This is the bowl to get if you want tuna and salmon! All the ingredients pair well together and the rice really ties everything together. You know it's good sushi if the rice is good!"}
{"text":"This place is more for a take out. The spicy salmon bowl is so so delicious! And the waiter is very nice and friendly! Would visit again."}
{"text":"This is a solid 4. The torched salmon and tuna were so so so delicious! Loved every bite. Its a very small resto. It can fit just a few people at a time. Its not a full service resto. Im not even sure if there is a washroom for customers. Also, its a bit pricey considering the former points I made. Despite those drawbacks, I would gladly come back because it taste so good! 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"Not sure if I would really come here without the BOGO discount. I think it's quite pricey for a take out place.   However, I thought the sushi was quite good, lots of fish on each piece of sushi. I think there was a tad too much mayo though - a bit less and the fish would have stood out more. I found some sushi was better than others. The shrimp tempera one was alright but not the best (shrimp was small, wasn't torched, would rather eat dynamite roll), the unagi one was not great either (it's alright but nothing special). I would recommend the torched salmon and tuna ones. Those were great!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi! My friend and I got the combo deal where you get 12 pieces of sushi, a soup and a seaweed salad for around $28-30.   However, the only bad experience I had was while my friend and I were studying the menu to decide what we wanted, one of the workers scoffed while laughing and asked us if we needed any help. Maybe it wasn't his intention, but it came off as really pushy and felt like he was judging us for taking so long - when there was no line and not busy. But other than the one, rest of the staff was really nice. Another con is that there's not many seating areas. They have a few stool seats but nothing else besides that.   Would go again but only for take out! ?"}
{"text":"TORCH has become my new addiction! The sushi here is always fresh and made to order, so I can't rave enough about the high quality of the food. I've tried a number of the different sushi, my favourite is the regular salmon. Great flavour paired well with the soy, mayo and sesame. Melt in your mouth & delish!   As other reviews mention, the price point for the sushi is a bit high, but again, top notch in terms of quality. The price point for the bowls I would say is average and similar at other poke/sushi places. I keep raving about the salmon, and that won't stop, because I also recommend the Spicy Salmon bowl - a fair amount of salmon with your choice of sauce/mayo to accompany it.   I only wish they had the non-goopy non-packaged wasabi, but that's a small complaint for this overall delicious place!"}
{"text":"We were advised that they make good torch sushi so came to try.  First thing first we can't find any parking spot and so we end up parking at another plaza and walked over.  We find the menu was very pricy for the sushi and rice bowl they offered.  We end up order torch salmon sushi, yam and banana sushi, and spicy salmon bowl.  The place is small so we have to wait for a a seat to be available in order to sit in to eat there.  With the premium price, we expected high quality food.  The server was nice and follow up with our order.  However, the food is just so so.  The torch salmon sushi can be better.  The spicy salmon bowl is not spicy at all.  The yam and banana sushi was pretty good as a desert.  With the price we paid today, we could have add extra $25 and two of us can eat at another ayce Japanese restaurant with high quality torch sushi."}
{"text":"Very average for the price.  We spent about $70 and was still hungry after, so the value really isn't there.  Poke bowl was SO SMALL. What the heck. The bowls downtown are bigger for cheaper.  The torched fish sushi melts in your mouth, which can be achieved at home with a torch of your own purchased at any home hardware stores.  It's alright but it's not as amazing as the reviews have it.  The thing we most disliked was that wasabi sauce that came with our poke bowl was thick! It was hard to get out and it was hard to mix in!  Parking is horrible. Limited seatings. Would not come back."}
{"text":"This place is BOMB! The torched sushi at this place is really good! I came here on the weekend on there last day of their grand opening promo. Luckily I had 3 people (including myself) with me so I could pretty much order the entire menu and try almost everything they have.   This was my order: All torched obviously  - Salmon  (got extra 3 pieces from their promo) -  Spicy Salmon -  Shrimp -  Tempura Shrimp  - Unagi  - Red snapper - Tuna   - Poke bowl and torched spicy salmon poke   I would describe every single torched sushi on that list but then this would be a long ass review and take too much typing. Needless to say the best and my personal favorite was the salmon which I got extra of too. It was a great choice to get more of the salmon too.   The salmon is soft and loaded with so much flavor. I find that this place is also quite generous with there slices of sashimi that they give you. They do not pack the whole aburi with rice. The portion ratio of rice versus fish is well balanced.   My least favorite one was the tempura shrimp. I just thought it was very original and didn't have much creativity or much flavor to that one. Perhaps I should of ate it with some soy sauce but most of the time aburi's you rarely need to dip it into soy sauce since there is already taste.   Both poke bowls were outstanding! Very generous in quantity and I thought the size was perfect for 2 people to share or even 1 person ( if your super hungry). The torched salmon poke was the first I have ever eaten torched poke and it did not disappoint. The original poke bowl was very good as well. They give you really good toppings such as seaweed salad, corn, peas, avocados and a mix of tuna and salmon fish.   Very delicious spot for aburi's and poke in North York. Definitely would come another time and eat everything on my list all over again and maybe try the yam & banana.  Staff there are really nice and pleasant. Cool guys!   Parking is a tough considering this place is located right on Yonge Street. There is limited parking in the Katsuya plaza. Your best bet is to find street parking on the two side residential streets, but even there can be tricky depending on timing."}
{"text":"This is a good place to get takeout torch pressed sushi without the fancy ambiance that you'd get at a downtown or midtown restaurant.  They're still fairly new and seems like they're still trying to work out logistics and efficiency during busy hours, so it took about 15-20 minutes to get 9 pieces of torched sushi for takeout.  The total came to $22, which I thought was a bit pricey.  It definitely wasn't enough to make two people full, but we came to get a quick snack since we were in the area, and it was a good snack! The guy who worked there was very nice and apologized for the wait and gave us two free miso soups which was nice of him, even though we were supposed to get only one.  We tried the spicy salmon, unagi and red snapper, and all were flavourful but I think the red snapper was the best one in my opinion.  All in all, I'd probably come back here for a snack, but it's not in a convenient location as there is no parking. Best place to park would be on a small street or in a plaza near by."}
{"text":"The sushi here is fcken amazing. And me and my boyfriend have had ALOT of sushi around town and we are picky as hell when it comes to sushi rice and how the fish is cut. Everything is so proportional and delicious!! Very sad they had to take out red snapper bc of market price increase! :("}
{"text":"The best pressed sushi in North York. No doubt!! Everyone should try it, and the employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"awesome stuff and fresh food and organized environment."}
{"text":"I went again. Still love their food. Yet, it is always a long wait for the sushi. I waited 40 min for my order at the store today. Lol"}
{"text":"Have been searching for a place to get my torched sushi craving satisfied and I've finally found it! Quality, food, service, atmosphere - all good. A little store along Yonge with few seating, definitely more catered to take out, which is what I ended up doing. I orders 3 pieces of the torched spicy salmon, torched tuna, torched red snapper, avocado, and torched shrimp - the torched red snapper was my favourite out of the bunch. Because I ordered over 12 pieces my meal came with a some freebies: a miso soup, a salad and a can of pop.   I do have to agree with some of the other yelpers here, a little on the pricey side but it's definitely good and imo, worth it. I'm so happy to see a quick in and out torched sushi options here in Toronto, I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"We took advantage of the deal when Torch just opened. Was super impressed cuz it was sooooo yummy! How lucky were we?   Ordered the  Spicy Pressed Sushi - Holy can I have more? It was so fresh and torched perfectly.  Spicy Salmon Bowl - This is prob their best bowl imho. The Salmon was so fresh and all the ingredients mixed together was just perfect.  Would come back again... but wish they could have more deals cuz on a regular day, it can be pricy. Best for pickup cuz there's practically no seating. Parking available on the side street."}
{"text":"I love the unagi poke here and the classic salmon one, their sauces are made in house and everything tastes super fresh and delicious! Also you got to try their dessert sushi, the tempura banana and yam is so good"}
{"text":"Got the Salmon Bowl, its salmon...in a bowl, on rice.  Torched added little value.  Wouldn't pay $15 for it.  Taste was fine, portions were small.  Chinese owners if that matters to anyone.  Took forever (45 min) for them to complete 2 orders of fish/veggies on rice.  As if they decided not to prep before opening. Since they are purely a take out place they got to get their operations in order."}
{"text":"The place is basically a take out place and pricey for that type of arrangement. You need to order at least 6 of them not to feel hungry and they are about $6 each.  I compared it to Miku, where I had theeeeeeee best eburi style sushi and although the price was cheaper here but I can say the quality was still good. Not as great as miku, but I think we should not compare the two. Overall I say for a takeout place that serves the food in a disposable plates with min service, it's just a bit towards the pricy side, if you really wanna feel full. Small portions too.  I'm not crazy about it as I was still hungry when we left the place, but I think give it a try once and you may love it or not go back, but it worth the try (at least once) Th seats are not comfortable and it may take some time for them to prepare the torched sushi so make sure to get the salad too. From what I remember, once you order 3 you'll get a salad with it."}
{"text":"We had the torched spicy salmon sushi, torched red snapper sushi, tempura shrimp sushi and torched spicy salmon bowl. My fav there is the spicy salmon torched sushi  My boyfriend hates eating raw fish but he LOVED the torched sushi from here  They have BOGO till end of the month, but should go early cause they ALWAYS run out of fish  It's hard to find parking there .... Very limited parking space  but overall the food is very good and they are very generous with the fish, that's probably why they run out fast. Staff is very friendly as well! I tried going back today at 2 pm and they already ran out of food"}
{"text":"Stopped by for their bogo special! They allowed us to choose other items instead of just the salmon. Since we placed 2 orders for the special we also got free salad and pop! They were fully packed with nowhere to sit so we decided to get take out, the server apologized for the delay and lack of seating! We'll definitely be back to try some of their other items!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Food quality was great for the price.  Looking forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"Very good pressed sushi available in a walk-in store front! I tried every pressed sushi on their menu that contained protein and was really satisfied. The staff was super friendly and suggested things we could order to take advantage of their soft opening specials. Although the regular pricing of the pressed sushi is a little on  the pricy side for takeout  sushi, I find myself getting full quickly  with these rice pieces after about 6. The fish was fresh and their sauces are superb. This new place definitely deserves a visit if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"This place is quite small and no washrooms for customers to use. Not so much a restaurant, more like a grab and go or eat fast then leave restaurant. I first tried aburi sushi from Miku and thoroughly enjoyed it (but not the price tag). I tried JA Bistro but found it too oily. However Torch surprised me, the price is way cheaper than Miku, plus they give you a miso soup if you order six pieces of sushi or if you order 12 pieces, they give you soup, salad and pop. So very value for money. As for the taste, Miku is still better but given the price, Torch tasted very good, close to what Miku is offering. So I think I found my aburi pressed sushi place!"}
{"text":"I love this place I've been here twice now if I lived  closer I'd come here everyday.  I always get the spicy salmon and unagi love the staff"}
{"text":"I love Torched sushi, so naturally when I find a place that is dedicated entirely to torching their sushi, you can bet I'm going to try it (still haven't been to Miku though). Anyways, I came here on a Saturday evening and was thoroughly impressed.   The store is located near Yonge and Steeles. It might be a bit difficult getting parking for free, but there's lots of options. If you are patient, you'll definitely get something. The store is small - most people get takeout - however they do have about 10 barstool seating if you would like to eat in the store.   The store has a bright and aesthetic appearance, and you can see the kitchen as well which is a nice touch.   The staff are super friendly and will help you with anything - although the menu is very minimal.   Decided on a torched Salmon sushi bowl and a spicy salmon sushi set (3 pieces). It is a bit pricey for takeout sushi, but you can taste the quality. The staff were very efficient in preparing my order after just walking in.   The food itself was amazing. Great flavours...that torched texture and taste can't be beat. I'll continue ordering the bowls - those are a pretty good deal. Wishing TORCH success in their restaurant!"}
{"text":"First time trying ot this place. Owner was nice and friendly and explained the different type of sushi. Purchase total 12 pcs take out but it did take some time for it to be ready as they make it on the spot. Parking is horrible, had to have husband part in plaza beside and watch the car while waiting for it. Sushi taste good and good deal with the buy one get one but reg price may be a bit too much for the quanitity you are getting. Too expensive for takeout. So its more like a 3.5 star."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the quality and effort put into each piece of sushi. TORCH Pressed Sushi specializes in aburi oshi sushi aka pressed sushi, battera or sushi box. Unlike your usual rolls, aburi oshi is shaped like a box and torched on the top giving it a creamy, buttery and seared flavour to each piece.  Depending on the fish, you can choose from tuna, salmon, prawn, unagi, and red snapper. Vegetarian options also include banana and yam and avocado. Hands down, their Red Snapper and Spicy Salmon were to die for. Would highly recommend those.  You also have the option of poke bowls but I would suggest you stick with the torched sushi. It does get very busy so either you get take out or go during unusual hours."}
{"text":"2.5 stars - Reviewing based on my delivery experience off of Skip the Dishes. I ordered 6 pieces of salmon and 6 pieces of the fantastic four. With 12 pieces, I received 2 additional miso soups, which was nice of them to offer.  When the box came, I noticed that it was quite greasy. The pieces fell apart when I tried picking it up with my chopsticks, so I resorted to eating it with a spoon to retain its shape. The salmon was a little too mild for my liking, and I felt like if the salmon was just a little bit thicker, it would've been the perfect ratio of rice to fish. Again, for some reason, it was very greasy, which turned me off from it.  I tried the fantastic four as well, which I much preferred. The red snapper was a little overwhelmed by the spicy mayo, but the texture provided from the tempura shrimp pressed in the middle had a nice bite to it. If I was to come back, I'd order this again.  My only complaint would probably be the price to quality ratio of what you get. For me, I could've gotten away with ordering just 6 pieces to get full. However, I find that it's still an overall pricy meal. 12 pieces was $27 and that equates to each bite being $1 and a bit. It's good, but not good enough for me to want to go out of my way to come here.  Try it once and see how you like it type of deal. I'll try and visit again to see if it tastes better when it's freshly made, but we'll see."}
{"text":"Had to jump in on this buy one get one free promo!  Torched pressed sushi, depending on which fish you choose, they range around $6.50 for 3 pieces. I had unagi, salmon, tuna and red snapper. All were flavorful and had a decent ratio of protien and ricem. Red snapper was my favorite, in the middle it had pieces of tempura shrimp.   The poke bowls, range from $12-14. We went for the spicy salmon poke bowl, and the torched unagi bowl. The spicy salmon bowl was good, lots of protein and without all the other ingredients, like how real poke bowls should be. The unagi bowl was disappointing though, tasted like the premade unagis you buy at the grocery store and just topped on rice.   Tbh It's quite expensive, so I would definitely go now while they are doing their buy one get one free promo! Hurry, deal ends Dec 31."}
{"text":"TORCH is a newly opened little takeout shop featuring aburi oshizushi and don/poke bowls. My girlfriend and I visited during their soft opening promotion (December 13-31), buy one get one free.  We ordered their snapper, salmon, spicy salmon, unagi, shrimp, and tuna pressed sushi. For us first-timers, they threw in the TORCH 12 combo special for which we were given free salad and miso soup. The salad consisted of spring greens, sliced cherry tomatoes, and a light citrus based dressing. The owner informed us all sauces and dressings were made in-house. We found the unagi and tuna (pickled onions and wasabi mayo) to be our least favourites as they tasted more aggressive in the sauce, overwhelming the main topping---still not bad at all. Our favourite by far was the snapper. Mayo based dressing, pressed in between the layer of snapper and rice was tempura imitation crabsticks---delicious! Special mention for the shrimp: elsewhere, shrimp pressed sushi is typically paired with just a glob of Japanese mayo, but the flavour was lighter, zestier citrusy in addition to some mayo---a nice change.  Overall, well worth the visit at these promotional prices. However, I imagine many people will find it quite steep at regular price and would tend to lean towards say KAKA or VIPS for comparable torched selections. In a pinch for a craving for saucy, smoky/torched fusion-type sushi, it certainly fits the bill. Still, I hope to see more promotions, more combo deals, and perhaps options for customization in the future."}
{"text":"This place is already becoming quite popular, and I expect it to continue to be. Most of the time, aburi oshizushi is only available at somewhat upscale sit-down Japanese restaurants. Torch is turning that idea upside down, and offering take-out options for their pressed sushi and poke bowls.  ATMOSPHERE:  It's a tiny little walk in shop with a few stools and standing tables. Enough space for some to sit, but definitely intended as a pick-up option.  SERVICE:  I had to wait 40+ minutes to get my order, which I was not thrilled with. However, the staff member was sincerely apologetic and friendly. Also, it was somewhat understandable given how busy they were with the buy one get one free special they were offering to celebrate their grand opening. The wait time also suggested to me that they were not willing to compromise quality for speed/convenience, which is a plus for me.  FOOD:  We ordered the Salmon Pressed Sushi, Spicy Salmon Pressed Sushi, Poke Bowl, and Spicy Salmon Bowl. All were amazing. The salmon for all the dishes were fresh, and seared perfectly. The spicy mayo sauce that accompanied the Spicy salmon bowl went so amazingly well with the sesame seed white rice. The spicy salmon pressed sushi was also quite impressive (yes, I like spicy salmon).   VERDICT:  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"10 bar style seats in total here. I ordered 6 torched salmon sushi ($12.95), and 6 torched tuna sushi ($15.75). For the 12 you get a miso soup, seaweed salad, and a canned soft drink (or bottle of water). At over $30 after tax, it is quite expensive for just 12 pieces. The portion sizes of the sushi aren't too big, and you get a small bowl for the soup and salad. For the taste of the sushi, I'd give it 4 stars, but the value is around 2.   The salmon sushi is topped with a nice soy sauce glaze. When you bite into it, it's a nice buttery taste with the smoky flavour from the torch. However, a few of the pieces began to fall apart when picked up so that was a bit disappointing.   The tuna was really good with the wasabi mayo and pickled onion on top. I'd say they added a bit too much mayo as it overpowers the onion and slightly overpowers the taste of the tuna. Again, there is a nice smoky flavour to each piece.   Overall it's a fine place for sushi, though the steep costs are enough to deter me from making it a regular place to visit."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Every morsel was amazing. Fresh and tasty. Tried eel, salmon, spicy salmon, shrimp tempura, red snapper. Sooo yummy. I'd like to say I'll be back as a regular, but I agree with other reviewers that say it will be pricey once the promo is over. Hopefully management will take into consideration their customers thoughts on pricing."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: My friend was so generous and she treated me. The Buy 6 Get 6 free was a good deal.   I do love my torch pressed sushi (Aburi-style+Oshi Sushi). They were tasty and have great umami flavour. The sauce and the seasoning just perfect without being overboard.  But regular price at $13.50 for 6 piece of Spicy Torch Salmon at a takeout place?    Without the special deal, it would be just painful spending that much for so little food. I would have to eat at least 2 orders just as a light lunch.  Surimi Sandwich starting from $6.99?! It did not look too good as a takeout. I hope my friend enjoyed that."}
{"text":"This is a small place with big flavours on their torched sushi and poke bowl. They have a variety of torched sushi to choose from. My fave is the spicy salmon sushi they have! Their poke bowl is also definitely something to try! Overall this is a place that I will visit whenever I have cravings for torched sushi!!"}
{"text":"Melt in your mouth perfect aburi sushi. Was pure deliciousness in every bite. I can't wait to go back for another round of sushi. If you order 12 pieces, you also get a miso soup and small seaweed salad, which were great as well. The location is more for takeout than dine in as there are just a few stools, but it is perfectly comfortable for a quick meal. Congrats to the owner and chef!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this newly opened sushi restaurant on yonge, tempted by their soft opening special of buy one get one free, my boyfriend and I walked in. The interior is clean and well lit with lots of natural lighting. The owner greeted us warmly, explained their menu selection and the more popular choices.   TORCH offers 10 different pressed sushi, with choices of aburi bowls and poke options as well. We ordered salmon, spicy salmon, spicy red snapper, tuna, shrimp, and unagi; we also got complimentary miso and salad for free with the purchase of our sushi. The red snapper is definitely my fav, it has tempura imitation crab within the pressed rice, which gives a nice and pleasing crunch when you bite in! Close second would be the spicy salmon and shrimp. They make all their dressing in-house, which is a nice bonus. The salad dressing was superb; tangy and sweet, with a hint of lemon within.   Overall this is a good place more for takeout and on the run lunch/dinner option. However the downside is that without the buy one get one free deal, I feel this place is quite over priced for the quantity of food I'm getting (~$6.70 for 3 pieces and ~$12+ for 6 pieces.) Since this promo goes until the end of the year, I would recommend to try it at least once."}
{"text":"The pressed sushi couldn't have been more well done! Everything I tried was creamy. The salmon torched sushi is my fave! They also offer avocado pressed sushi, which is pretty unique as I've never seen it before. However, it tastes just as you would imagine - avocado with rice with a hint of mango sauce - nothing mindblowing but nice to try once for the novelty :) The staff is very friendly and provided excellent service.  However, the price per piece is very high, especially for a take-out kind of spot...  :/ For that reason I don't see myself coming back again unless there's a special promotion. There also isn't much seating available in store (maybe around 6 seats, all of which are counter/bar type seating)."}
{"text":"I'm a little late to the game but finally dropped by Torch Pressed Sushi to try their much talked about aburi sushi. I've had aburi sushi in the past and it hasn't always been my first choice as I've felt that restaurants sometimes use fish that is not quite fresh because they can disguise the subpar quality with the torching and the sauces. However, after trying the aburi sushi at Torched Pressed Sushi, I think I will have to change my tune.  I ended up trying three different types of aburi sushi. The Torched Salmon ($6.59/3pc) is definitely my favourite. A thick piece of salmon sashimi is layered with Japanese mayo, unagi sauce and topped with sesame. The fish and mayo were torched giving the sushi a nice smoky aroma and making the salmon delightfully melt-in-your-mouth creamy and accentuated the sweet, rich fatty flavour of the fish. The rice was nicely seasoned and the slight sweet acidic flavour perfectly balanced the richer deep flavours of the fish and sauces.  The Torched Surimi ($5.95/3pcs) is new on the menu and is a good option if you prefer lighter fresher flavours. The sushi is topped with a mix of imitation crab, cucumber, masago and mayo and then topped with some fresh diced mango. I enjoyed the sweet crab flavour mixed in with the creaminess of the mayo and the mangos on top gave it some extra tropical sweetness.  The Torched Fantastic Four ($6.59/3pcs) is probably the most Instagrammable and labour intensive. Pieces of tempura shrimp, tempura imitation crab are rolled into the rice at the bottom and then the entire thing is topped with a layer of tai and spicy mayo and finally topped with some tobiko and green onion. The tempura inside is still slightly crispy and the spicy mayo gives the sushi a punch of flavour. I liked how the green onions gives a hint of freshness at the end.  Prices here are on the more expensive side but the quality of food and service here is top notch! The cashier and the girl making my sushi were both really friendly. There was only one customer ahead of me but I think the store was preparing a larger order and let me know ahead of time that there might be a little bit of a wait. I was given my miso soup first (comes free with 6 pieces of sushi) and while I was waiting, the girl making the sushi asked if I wanted to try the surami as well and added that to my order with no charge. Location wise, it was a little hidden (actually directly behind the TTC stop - the TTC shelter blocked my view of it initially) but look for the samurai looking building (red and black roof) on the north west corner of Yonge and Connaught and you'll find your way there."}
{"text":": Spicy Salmon Bowl : I am in love with Poke bowls, after seeing this on the menu, it looked really different than a regular poke bowl so I decided to give it a try. Very creamy, with semi raw salmon, great combination in the poke bowl, salmon did not taste fishy which is great! : $14.63 after tax"}
{"text":"Really flavorful aburri. Only negative was the small and hot space. This is a takeout place -pure and simple."}
{"text":"Rating: 4.5/5 Aesthetics: 3.5/5 Food: 5/5 Service: 4/5 Recommendation: Torched Spicy Salmon Bowl if you're hungry, Torched Spicy Salmon if you want to try their pressed sushi!  Insta tip: get really close and personal with the pressed sushi putting focus on a forefront piece to really show focus on the detail and deliciousness of every single masterpiece!  Overall: Somewhat pricier for sushi, but it'll be worth every perfect and detailed piece of oshizushi!  Revitalizing the sushi scene around North York, TORCH Pressed Sushi is bringing some much-loved oshizushi to the uptown area. I give this small shop a 4.5 star because the food is really amazing here and a perfect blend between the flavors they mix together. The store itself is quite small with little seating area so it's not an ideal sit-down-and-eat place, but the food definitely makes up for the small area. Take out if you can!  The spicy salmon bowl blew me away because of the texture and perfection of their underlying rice - moist, but not wet, but still flavorful, but not overbearing. It blends really well with the perfectly torched salmon ontop and some light greens as well.   The torched pressed sushi (we opted for shrimp, spicy salmon, and snapper) is their signature style. Detailed to perfection with every single piece and a perfect chemistry of the flavors present. You can definitely see the passion put into each piece being made! Each piece is heaven once you eat it. I definitely recommend sharing a few different ones."}
{"text":"Very good quality pressed sushi. I would say they are better than higher end restaurants. We would love the way here more often since it is very close to our house but the price is pretty expensive for take out ($30 - $40 for two people). If there are more promotions we would like to visit more."}
{"text":"The pressed sushi was delicious here. I still love Miku more, but this comes pretty close. I prefer their pressed sushi over their poke bowls"}
{"text":"Torch Pressed Sushi is located a bit north of Cummer/Yonge. Parking is quite limited and can be difficult to find. It is also more of a take out joint as there were only around 9-10 bar seats available and no washrooms on site. I came by for lunch on a weekday. The place was quiet but I did notice that several customers came by to pick up their take out orders. The owners were very friendly and attentive. They explained that their most popular torched sushi items were the torched spicy salmon and the torched red snapper; he also stated that the torch shrimp was a lighter item as the shrimp had a citrusy, light flavour to them. The owner also suggested that if I wanted a snack, 3-6 sushi pieces would be ideal, if I wanted to have it as a meal, 9-12 pieces would be recommended depending on how hungry I was. I decided to get 3 pieces of each of the most popular items (spicy salmon, red snapper, and shrimp) and the total came out to around $22. Miso soup was included as well. The owner also gave me a free salad as I had waited a bit longer than usual for my food to be prepared.  All three torched sushi items were great! It was up to par with the other torched/aburi sushi places in Toronto. The torched shrimp sushi had a great citrus component to it where the mayo did not overpower the taste and flavour of the shrimp. The torched spicy salmon was just mildly spicy for me and there was a generous amount of salmon in the sushi. Lastly, the red snapper was the surprise out of the three; inside the red snapper sushi there were tempura shrimp and a slight spiciness in the sauce they used. Overall the components of the sushi worked well together making it a delicious bite to eat.   Overall, great addition to the neighbourhood, it's great that they offer torched sushi in small amounts (so either 3 or 6 pieces). The food is also made to order so you know that it is being prepared fresh. It is a bit pricey as it adds up so I'd only come back once in a while."}
