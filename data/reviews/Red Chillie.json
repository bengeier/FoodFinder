{"text":"I love the chicken fried rice, Hugh pieces of chicken breast every time! Delivery is very fast as well. I love that they can tell you what you ordered the last time- just in case you forgot!"}
{"text":"Everything tastes great. Price is reasonable for the quality. They have a huge menu to choose from."}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing!!  Every single time you order anything the food is spectacular!!!  Best Chinese in the west end hands down!"}
{"text":"I ordered Sticky rice, My shu tofu & vegetables, Thai spicy wings and Szechuan fried rice on May 16. The Thai spicy wings had very fat skins, but the other 3 dishes were excellent. The service is unfriendly though: when I went to pay and asked if they took debit cards, the guy nearly jumped down my throat and said they take credit cards or cash as stated on their website. I told him to take it easy, that I hadn't ordered from them before. I then I gave him a Visa card, and he sneeringly said that they preferred cash. I told him the card was it.   I probably will order from them again because of the food, but I will be on the lookout for another local Chinese restaurant that has good food and better service."}
{"text":"Next to City Wok, you will not find better Chinese food in the area. Consistently high quality menu items. Expect a wait on holidays as they are constantly in demand. Chinese food in the Oakville market has been very sink or swim. Red Chillie has outlasted the others and it's obvious why."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for Chinese takeout.  They are always willing to substitute.  Always quick, fresh and quality made food.  Great prices and options.  They always provide a good amount of sauce and are always friendly."}
{"text":"This place was great three years ago, the last three times I had take out from here it was awful, the fried rice was gross, it seemed like it was boiled, very bland. We also had the crispy chicken...it was full of fat, they should call it crispy FAT chicken. The egg rolls were decent and the chicken balls were just ok. The people at the counter were not friendly, I think i'll spend my cash elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, but They keep messing up my order which is very frustrating, every time I ask for thin noodles they send thick ones, and when I asked for shrimp they will send pork. Also the food has no consistency, I will order the same thing but receive it cooked or seasoned very differently then the last time, I keep ordering from Red Chillie because they really are some of the best tasting and best quality Chinese food in Oakville, but I just wish they would know their menu better."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food!  Take a look at the Peruvian / Chifa  Menu they have.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"\"Dennis\" the food was great. U should stay away from the phone. U come across like an asshole. And I've been told u are not that.  The food is amazing...always is..5/5 everytime!  But if I have a credit on my account for aomething, something u guys messed up with....don't treat me like I'm acting for a handout when u charged me for it and credited my account. Be a man. Be a good owner...and I hear u are...just don't be an asshole on the phone."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in GTA, hands down. I moved from Oakville to Etobicoke and will drive 25 minutes each way, on occasion, just to order from here, because I haven't found a suitable alternative in my area. Highly recommend it.   The original owners are still involved with this location (it's take out and delivery only) and the sit down restaurant in Burlington. The cooks have been there for 15+ years! Consistent quality.  Try the panfried dumplings with the peanut sauce, or the crispy shrimp in spicy seasoning. Cantonese chow mein is also excellent!"}
{"text":"This is literally the only place I will eat Chinese food from! Orange Peel chicken is amazing and beef hofun.    Not too greasy is why I keep coming back to this place."}
