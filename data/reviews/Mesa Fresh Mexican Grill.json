{"text":"I would liken this place to a McDonald's of Mexican food, or more accurately, it's a really awful attempt at a Mexican version of Panera. Everything I ate here was just so-so. But hey, it was Mexican food, so I wasn't too upset. I would recommend something larger scale, cheaper or more authentic then this place."}

{"text":"This place wasn't too bad. I'm from the SW so I've had my fair share of Mexican food. I had some carne asada tacos with rice and beans and they were pretty good. This place is nothing to rave about, but I'd come back here if I was in town again and needed a fix."}

Fresh means.....fresh

This place definitely had tables.  But all the marketing in the world isn't going to make this place taste fresh.

To be honest, I don't consider myself a Mexican food expert, since my experience of the authentic stuff was clouded by drunken weeks in Merida and Cabo - but I have had some damn tasty fish tacos on the west coast, hawai'i, hell even Denver.  The fish tacos I had here were just bad and really can't even warrant a comparison to those places.

The fish was greasy (but grilled), the tortillas were stale, there was the mayonaisse stuff squirted on top (odd)  and finally the pico de gallo was absent thanks to the current salmonella scare with tomatoes, 

but their 'made fresh daily' salsa was in full supply (not made from those same tomatoes? ?  maybe they roast them - who knows) 


and the 'hot' salsa was anything but.....and bland.

all said, this was a bad experience.  Not terribly surprised since this 'fresh' food joint was wedged in a strip mall between a Dairy Queen and a hardware store.

if you get stuck in this particular strip mall, pop over the the pizza joint and accept that it's a better option"}
