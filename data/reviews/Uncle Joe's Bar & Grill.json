{"text":"Spot was great.   A dive sure but a great dive.  Bartender can't remember her name but was a milf.     I'd definitely go there again.  Wings weren't bad either.  But yea bartender was a hot milf."}
{"text":"I would rate it a zero if I could. The food is overpriced and took forever. My burger was raw even though I ordered it well done and I waited over 30 minutes to get it. The bartenders were polite but unfortunately way more interested in getting drunk than serving guests. One of them was actually flipping off customers, disgraceful!  A domestic draft beer is $4.50 way overpriced Over all not a great place we won't be back."}
{"text":"Big ass burgers. Meat is fried, nothing special, but toppings were great. Miller Lites were $4 for a tall. Free pool on Tuesday and Sunday. Touch tunes machine playing all my Supertramp favorites. Fresh cut fries were great. Tater tots tastes like oil."}
{"text":"I had a great time @ Uncle Joe's. Every time I go in this bar I have a great time :) service was great. Bartenders are awesome.  They know how to put a smile on every face ! The food my friend got was great.he got a burger called the tower I believe , it was HUGE . I would say if you want to have fun in a great atmosphere and friendly ppl. Go to Uncle Joes. Its GREAT"}
{"text":"Worst bar ever. I can't even describe how bad the service was. We had a party of 8 and had to get our own warm beers after being seated. We ended up walking out after not having our orders taken for over 15 mins. Joe, this bar needs a lot of work"}
{"text":"The food is your standard, American pub far. There's nothing wrong with that, but it may turn some people off if you're looking for something a little more adventurous. The food was cooked properly, tasted good and was inexpensive. Specifically, the larger portion of boneless wings was extremely filling for just $6.99.
There's something to be said for the jukeboxes these days that aren't just one large computer touch screen. There's a box in here with mostly classic rock. Good stuff.
Bartenders were nice and cordial. I've seen complaints on other sites complaining of rude bartenders here - perhaps the real reason is the rude customer? Took orders, served drinks, etc, and didn't have any problems."}
{"text":"What a bar in Parma should be: friendly staff, bar food (fried bologna sandwiches?! Boss) karaoke on Friday and Saturday nights, plenty of space, good parking... Nothing glamorous, but that's not why you're going to a bar. You're going for cheap booze and fun with your friends."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! A dive bar in the best way possible. Service was incredibly friendly and fast. The burgers were to die for and only $5 on lunch special!!! Seem to be a ton of regulars and for very good reason. :) We just moved to the neighborhood and we were in search of a go-to bar. To top it off we were treated to shots by the owner. They were apple pie shots- the best I've ever had. So delicious."}
{"text":"The people is what makes this bar great.  If you're sick of the nonsense and overpriced foo foo drinks, go to Joe's, it's a real bar!  The cook makes a different homemade soup every day and it's delicious! Real food, cheap drinks, and as laid back as it gets.  There's T.V.'s with sports, a dance floor, and plenty of room for tables. There's something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Came to this place one night with my mom and a mutual friend. We chose this over our initial destination as they were closer and offered karaoke. Drinks are great and reasonably priced, with awesome monthly specials. Food here is good too---I highly recommend the ranch fries, but make sure you have someone to share them with or ask for a box, because you get a ton of fries! Service is quick and staff is always friendly, never snobby. Karaoke on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. If you're looking for a fun, laid back place that won't take a chunk out of your wallet, you've gotta check out Uncle Joe's!"}
