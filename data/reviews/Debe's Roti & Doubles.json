{"text":"Its a nice little takeout place.  The chicken and shrimp rotis were very delicious - generous portions and not oily at all.  Even the roti without pepper was really tasty.  Saheena, aloo pie and Doubles are all must try.  We are from Ottawa but we will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"My husband picked me up after work and we stopped by Debe's for a snack, which turned into a meal because the portions are large :)  the Doubles are SO DELICIOUS, you can taste every single flavour from lentils, chickpeas, mango chutney etc.,  considering they are a vegetarian item I could eat this every day. The Roti is literally giant, and my husband couldn't be happier right now trying to devour the whole thing. We will be back for sure yumm!!!"}
{"text":"Sign on door says closed until March 8th. Voicemail says closed until March 10th. It is March 11th and because it is a Sunday they are closed. On top of that they have been closed since February 18th. Poor service. Don't waste your time going here because they probably won't be open."}
{"text":"Tiny place in a shady plaza. You go in and it's terrible looking, like walking into a warehouse. But,  they've  got all day doubles. awesome warm hit the spot deliciousness. I've yet to try anything else , hopefully another day :)"}
{"text":"Always service with a smile and a nice large helping of food. Either the Chicken or Goat roti are my regular meals. They have a good Tuesday special and a nice selection of drinks as well."}
{"text":"WAT! This place is 3 blocks from my house and I *just* discovered it?!?! Deeeelish trini food. Roti SUPER stuffed and so yummy. Now I don't have to drive all the way to Roti Roti in Rexdale for my fix. Yum yum"}
{"text":"I got a great deal on great tasting doubles today!  First time visit after finding Debe's on Yelp. I called and ordered 5 doubles and was pleasantly surprised to be offered the special \"6 for the price of 5\"! Too bad though, only 4 made it back home. ;-) I will be back for sure!  So much more to try!"}
{"text":"I appreciate the food at Debe's and know the effort and love that goes into this food.  Hands down thE most smooth silk like dal puri ever!  The doubles are out of this world.  Spicy means spicy here so make sure you are prepared if you ask for hot.  They are nice here and have a loyal customer base.  The tomato choka is like home made.  Mmmmmm.   They don't drown food in oil here ... just a lot of flavor.  Debe's knows how to lift my spirits on a Friday night after a long week."}
