{"text":"Something is just off about this location.  Tucker's is usually pretty good.  The Burlington location is much better.   Here, the onion strips weren't cooked properly.  They were white, raw and soggy, when golden crisp and crunchy.  Things to try at Tuckers, the chili, the Potato Leek soup is the best soup I've ever had a restaurant. The made to order cheeseburger, with bacon and the desert section is decent.  I recommend Tucker's, just not this location."}
{"text":"A friend took me to this AYCE place last weekend, interior is nice servers check up on you when they not busy,okay the food was okay not that great, the only food i like was the chilli, roast beef, thai chilli fish, lamb stew, and the desserts were okay, otherwise this place is good but might come back or not"}
{"text":"Where do I start with Tucker's Marketplace?  I was invited out by some friends to Tucker's marketplace and I'm not sure why they chose this place, maybe its all the radio ads they hear.  Anyways, here is my run down on the place.  The food is nothing special and is really just your typical dishes - peas, corn, beef, chicken, pasta, salad, etc. really bland stuff with really no taste other than salt and pepper  The price is a bit expensive for the food they serve.  However, I do have to say their locations are nicely designed with really nice tables, chairs, dinnerware etc .. but its to bad they don't put the same amount of effort into their food.  I recommend this place only if your just planning on wasting a few dollars with friends and don't care what your going to be eating!"}
{"text":"Very average food. Very pricey for dinner (with tax and tip expect $25). Wide selection, clean, friendly, but kind of bland and not special."}
{"text":"Tucker's has been one of my favorite restaurants even since I was a kid. I've been there for about 4 or 5 birthday dinners as well as birthday dinners of friends and family (You eat free on your birthday). It is a buffet restaurant complete with a huge salad bar, their amazing chili, and food from your basic chicken, to mussels, and yummy roast beef as well as desert. Their brunch menu is slightly different from their dinner menu with more breakfast-y items served at brunch and also a bit cheaper. Staff is friendly, the cooks are great, and the environment is perfect for family. I approve this restaurant xD lol."}
{"text":"Came in today and didn't know you get to eat for free for your bday but price was definitely no issue... But ya,  my impression would be that it's friendly staff,  nice environment and overall service was great for that they get 3 stars but for the food I was far from thrilled.  My family's used to Mandarin as soon as we hear the word buffet but this was our attempt for some variety.   The food quality wasn't that great... They were fresh as I've seen them bring in new plates a few times and they're rarely empty but the selection was awfully small and the food wasn't at great.  The only thing we liked were the beets, Sweet n sour Fish and that was that.  Desert needs an update and overall variety needs... More.   UPDATE: This place went out of business last I checked.  Sad to see it but with what they got....I so see that coming."}
{"text":"Wasn't too big on the food. Breads were stale and rice pudding wasn't good quality either. Chili wasn't great either. The frosting on the brownies literally came off. What kind of brownie is that?! Mandarin is wayyyyyy better!"}
{"text":"I'm generally not all that big on buffets, but I've always had a fondness for Tuckers. I've done a bunch of family dinners there over the years, and have never really had a complaint.  The food itself really isn't anything really special, but it has its bright spots. I mean, I like the idea of loading up a plate full of the psychotic mix of ice cream sundaes, pizza, their terrific chili, roast beef, and alpha getty, and then go back for salad afterward, just to be weird.  The place itself is very easy to navigate, their servers very courteous, and the dining areas are nice. For 15 dollars, it really is a decent place to go.   It should also be worth noting that if you go on your birthday, you eat free."}
{"text":"I'm not a big buffet user.  I try and watch what I eat and not over-indulge.  However, Tucker's is my eldest daughter's favourite restaurant so we were there for her birthday recently.  The first thing to point out - if you have ID and show that its your birthday your meal is free.  Some people at a nearby table found out the hard way when their birthday was the prior day.  The food was ok. I had the split pea soup (B+), and then I went and sampled a little bit of a lot of the buffet.  You must visit the roasting stations - I had the roast beef and the riblets this time.  Both were well worth it.  All 3 kids loaded up on pizza, pasta and dessert.  I think my son single-handedly munched 12 slices of watermelon, and the 2 yr old got at least 6.  A lot of the bread and dinner rolls have been placed higher up, and my son and tiny daughter had to beg me to go and get them rolls.  We had a very attentive server (Adam) who took it upon himself to make sure that we were well taken care of.  He was constantly checking in on us"}
{"text":"Perfect place for birthday celebrations (birthday lad eats for free). Kid friendly, Gramps friendly, Toddler-in-your-arms friendly.   It's a buffet style restaurant, one of the better ones in Mississauga; miles better than Mandarin.  My picks for a weekday dinner, which I believe costs $18.99: 1. Soup, bread to start 2. Pesto salad nom nom 3. Instruct to make your own pasta at the pasta bar 4. Slice of medium rare beef and gravy and the pilaf rice - this is probably the best worth of your money 5. Mussels  6. Smores dipped in the chocolate fountain for dessert   I don't know what the hell people are complaining about. This place compares well to Hot House Cafe in Toronto."}
{"text":"Not the best buffet restaurant I've been to but...The best things about buffets? They are fast, you can try everything and you can eat your fill. At Tucker's Market the buffet features so call \"American\" fare and some international dishes. Everything is made fresh from scratch! For all you salad lovers their salad bar has over 10 different pre-made salads with an option to create your own. Just walk over to the \"cook stove\" and design your own pasta or stir fry dish. Can't forget about the Carvery. There you'll find roast beef, ham, rotisserie chicken and even made-to-order hamburgers! Walk over to the hot table for a selection of international dishes. Make sure to leave room for desert!"}
{"text":"Havent been here in a long time, but isnt really anything special. Staff was friendly. Food is okay - let's just say there wasn't anything i tried that i went back for seconds. Lots of variety of foods though"}
{"text":"Worst buffet I've ever been to.  I preferred the $5.99 China Buffet I tried once.  Food was very bland, selection was small, salads were wilted, no sign of vegetables anywhere, gravy was congealed and the \"roast beef\" was the size of my fist and then they slice off 2 paper thin slices for you.  Also was extremely overpriced at $19 on a Tuesday night.  Better off going to Mandarin."}
