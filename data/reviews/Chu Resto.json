{"text":"A complete business fail.  *this review is purely based on the business management, not on the food (we left after over 30 mins of waiting)*  Very very very poorly organized for grand opening. There are only a few seats available and they had not even set up the tables for customer use. We were lucky enough to get a table but we were not told to line up to order the food. The promotion started at noon and people suddenly filled the place. People were not lining up and everyone was crowding around the counter. All the employees looked very confused and not prepared for opening. They don't even know how to use the machines!! Some employees at the back were discussing and arguing about what to do. They clearly don't know how to run a business.   Some people ordered like six free noodles even though they only had two people, and the cashier allowed them to do so.  There's a storage/electric switch cabinet above the table at the back. While we were waiting for our food, they had to come open the doors to turn on some switches. They have done this four times. All the dust was flying out of the cabinet onto our table.  The group seated at the table that came in last managed to get their food first... we waited for 30 mins and still no food. There were at least three orders ahead of us. We asked for a refund and left. Their machines were already failing and they had to keep switching the electric switches. Their kitchen is very tiny, not meant to be a restaurant and it cannot support this amount of orders (keep in mind this used to be a ShareTea).  If you don't know how to run a business please spend more time practicing before opening up to the public. Clearly these people just opened up without any planning or business experience. Just because you know how to cook doesn't mean you can open up a restaurant. This location is not meant to be a restaurant given its size and design.   0/5 - No matter how good the food is, if you cannot serve it in a timely manner, no one will be able to try the food."}
{"text":"Love shumei? good taste  and I also like the hot dry noodles without any topping?lol it's a good time with my friends. Btw, the noodles is not enough for me."}
{"text":"I had never try something like this before. the noodles tasted so good and I will come back for sure. even I don't like something so dry, I still can finish it."}
{"text":"*I haven't been to the restaurant yet* BUT, I tried their \"signature noodles\" at the Taste of Asia food festival this weekend and loved it! I'm not sure if they sell it in store because I've been trying to find it on their take-out menu, but I'll definitely be visiting their restaurant to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"I've ordered the crab noodles, texture was good and the flavour is very good. There was a good amount of crab inside. I've asked what the sauce is, the waitress told me there is peanut butter in the sauce. Usually I don't like any sauce with peanut butter but the way they flavour the sauce is good.   I got my hubby a beef one for take out, he really enjoyed it and suggested he wants to take his friend from work to try! Grand opening is 20% on all noodles until April 24th 2018!"}
{"text":"First time being here in general. It was called Wuhan 1950 before and it has just recently rebranded itself. Friend and I came here for lunch, roughly 1pm. It was empty so the food came quickly so I can't speak for other times; the place is quite small, can probably only seat... 10 people maximum? Maybe even less.  Ordered the hot dry noodle, one beef one crab meat. The crab meat was on the side of being too little in my opinion for something that was $13.99, $4 more than the beef hot dry noodle which was $9.99. The regular signature one is $7.99. We also ordered a side dish, the Wuhan Shaomei and it was yummy.  It was delicious, however, I can't say I am a huge fan of the style/cuisine, and neither was my friend. But I am sure it's because my tastebuds were unappreciative of it. It was saucy in the sense that it has a strong taste to it. One I'm not too used to.  I recommend people to try it though! You'll never know if you do until you try it! :)  Since they've rebranded, they have 20% off all noodle dishes until April 24, 2018. Enjoy it while it lasts :)"}
{"text":"Wow... did I go to a different place? This is legit bad. What a joke.   First off this place is at a condo and so parking is a bit weird cuz the parking is supposed to be for the condo visitors.  Anyways, this place literally has only a dozen seats. U order the food and find your own seat.   We ordered a combo which include a bowl of noodles, egg drop sweet soup and a piece of sticky rice pizza. The combo was extra two bucks because we wanted the intestine noodles, making it 12.99. And we also ordered a chicken cartilage wide vermicelli for 10.99. I also checked into yelp to get a three piece shumei for free. Total it was $27.   All the food came in disposable plastic take out containers. Nothing like the pictures. But that's not a dealbreaker, let's talk about the food itself!  1. Chicken cartilage wide vermicelli. Some chicken cartilage are cold. They didn't microwave it long enough. Yes looks like they don't have a proper kitchen it's just microwaving. We heard the beep. And you can feel the tiny grainy bone next to the cartilage. And the wide vermicelli is essentially Ho fun ??. It was all mushy not appetizing at all. Take a look at a video I took. The taste itself meh, oily and loaded with the sesame paste with bits of preserved veggies that add a crunch. If u have microwaved leftover ho fun, this is exactly it.  2. Intestine noodles. I didn't eat the intestine but bf said it's not smelly. I tried the noodles. It's better(?) than the ho fun but it's also very greasy loaded with sesame paste, gunk sitting at the bottom, making it taste even a bit bitter.... 3. Sticky rice pizza is essentially a piece of ??? (the glutinous rice with chicken wrapped in leaf dim sum) cut into a square.  4. Wuhan shumei. Maybe I have never tried it wuhan style but the texture is truly off. It is so soft it's like dripping! It's essentially the same glutinous rice in a different format. 5. Egg drop rice sweet soup. In the fridge... cuz we were so stuffed from the greasy pasty noodles.   I mean.... it's TWENTY FRICKING SEVEN DOLLARS! For this price you are definitely better off eating at Sansotei for a jap ramen, MeiNung for a flavorful beef noodle soup, Wonton Hut for beef brisket wonton noodles or any hk style chachantang for a porkchop vermicelli. This is such a joke. Such a bad joke.   I decided to try it out as I saw that there are a few locations in Toronto already, thinking that it should be ok. But this is far from OK. Maybe other locations that have a legit kitchen would be better but I wouldn't wanna try.   Half a star for the cashier who was nice and explained the menu to me. Otherwise this would be a negative.  And we later found that the guy who occupied the most comfortable sofa seat by himself should be the owner/manager....(?) idk. Shouldn't the more comfortable seats be reserved for customers?  Don't go. You have been been warned."}
{"text":"I have to say this is a wonderful place to have some delicious and fast food Recommend shumei strongly!!!!!"}
{"text":"Another reason why i don't want to visit a new restaurant that all hype up on social media. Noodle is good, nice texture. Sauce is awesome. I got the crayfish and intestines. Like it both Ordered pan fried bao - came out the meat still raw  Server changed to another one, the last one i ate still raw They still charge me on the receipt Place is very small. Can sit like 8-10 people Server is not knowledgeable about menu, again, common problem with any other small new Chinese restaurant. She was eating lunch next to us too which is very rude because there are still customers coming in I dont understand where is there basic server manners"}
{"text":"This is a nice and relaxed place to feed myself some fast lunch. I ordered the basic traditional hot dry noodle, quick and yummy enough. But i always have something heavier for dinner, so maybe not here."}
