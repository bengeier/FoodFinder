{"text":"Delicicious! I had the spaghetti bacon carbonara and it was fantastic but I will defiantly try some gnocci when I go next time. It's a very romantic and dim lighted restaurant, take your gf she will be impressed. You don't even need to order an appetizer (although the calamari was awesome!) because you get bread with spread and peppers in oil. Amazing. And there is limited parking in the back because they share it with pizza 73 or something"}
{"text":"Delightful experience! Certainly didn't expect to find this gem in a strip shopping center. Started with a very tasty and plentiful minestrone soup. Then I had the veal scallops in a brandy sauce with mushrooms and was licking my plate. The house red wine was superb. And lastly, we enjoyed the Bananas Foster for dessert. YUM!! Best dinner of the three we had while in Calgary."}
{"text":"I'm shocked that there is NO Yelp review for this little gem of a restaurant! Ok here goes.   I've been there a few times  for lunch and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Its well located and there's ample street parking around. The ambience is very pleasant and the dining area spacious. It appears busy during lunch and the service ie prompt and attentive.   The menu is great with some excellent selections of, well what did you think? Gnocchi of course...with a variety of different and optional sauces. Yummy! Those of you who are unfamiliar with Gnocchi, it's simply a tiny potato dumpling...and you get lots of it, smotherd in Italian sauces that only your best ltalian friend's grandmother can make! Talk about fresh tasting flavours! from al pesto to da mare...my favourite sea food sauce. Creamy, rich, ricotta, decadent brandy sauce!   What more can I say?  Having grown up in a country making the finest brandies since1654...these culinary experiences, infused with brandy, cultivate a continuous love for the cute little Gnocchi dumpling.  What would the world be without the Italian influence?  Desserts served with Espresso and Grappa! A fine end to a business lunch!   I'm told that this is the most romantic restaurant in Calgary...I cannot comment on this assertion as I have not had the pleasure of eating there with a loved one! Definitely worth going to!"}
{"text":"The waiter suggested the blue cheese gnocchi. This was a good call and the food was very good.  Keep in mind before going in this isn't a spaghetti joint, they specialize in gnocchi. Great place for a date as the lights are low and she won't see you for the hideous  beast you truly are. Great experience."}
{"text":"A - List. Recommended. Fantastic Food. Awesome Desserts. Great Service."}
