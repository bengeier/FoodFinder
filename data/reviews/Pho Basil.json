{"text":"For the price, I would drive 5 mins more to Markham for more authentic Pho place. It's okay-ish being in Stouffvile area. Also, it doesn't come with free Tea unlike the place we go to in Markham."}
{"text":"They are not perfect or the best, and they might not make you dance in your seat from yummy-ness...but they're here in STOUFFVILLE.


If you want the best, then it'll take some effort for the drive out of town (as is true for any other Asian cuisine as well); but if you're just in the mood for a little Vietnamese taste, then it's all good because they're only 5 minutes away tops!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and pho the large House Special Pho. Portion size was good and it came out to around $10 after tax. Owner was very friendly and attentive. Not the best pho place I've been to (another person noted that the broth was a bit weak and I totally agree) but overall it was a good experience and it's in town. It's about time!"}
{"text":"Probably the best take-out in town!

I'm 10 minutes away, and I literally have to ask them to slow-roll my take-out orders because they're so quick. And the food is always hot and very fresh.

The pho is just ok, but if you get it sage style it's really tasty. The bun is really good--especially the ones with fried spring rolls.

It's kinda sparse as a sit-down dinner place, but if take-out is your preference you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really friendly and helpful staff, quick service, the food was really good, we ordered beef brisket noodle soup, sate chicken noodle soup and deep fried spring rolls."}
{"text":"Pho in Stouffville? That's an automatic plus. Pretty simple menu of beef noodles, vermicelli, rice and pad Thai. I had the pad Thai with beef, obviously I didn't expect it to be authentic or anything but it was still pretty good. My friends had their beef noodles and grilled chicken vermicelli, both were average they said. Owners were really nice.  Their food isn't special but not bad. Still, any real Asian food in Stouffville makes me really happy."}
{"text":"We order the Beef Noodle Soup, Pad Thai, Springroles and Lemon Grass Rice. None of the food we ordered was good. The rice was overlooked to the point it was mush and the pad thai was flavourless. I'm sure when you get pho at an actual restaurant it is amazing but here it was super bland. 
I do not understand why Stouffville loves this place."}
{"text":"The food was okay but restaurant atmosphere needs some work. The price for the food was great though! It is nice to have a new option that is close in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"We have lived in Stouffville for about 10 years and never thought we would see an authentic vietnamese restaurant in our town. 

I had to try them and the pho soup does not dissappoint. We no longer have to travel far for authentic viet food!"}
{"text":"Listen I'm not an expert Pho chef, nor am I anything close to Vietnamese, but factoring in everything including location, pricing, taste, service this place deserves a 4.5 and I'll round to 5.0 because it's located in my small town.

Been meaning to try this place for a while especially since it a) is a pho place and b) is a new restaurant in Stouffville, ON but for whatever reason I just haven't been able to find the time to do it.

i said screw it I'm going in for take out and giving it a shot on a perfectly cold, winter night. 

the place looks good and especially good in regards to the old Chinese restaurant that was here before.

Menu has all of the staples including the House Special and noodle dishes. what I really liked was the attentiveness of the owner who was friendly, fast, and very accommodating.

got two house specials and a pad thai. I know it's not the true traditional pad thai but the way they did it here reminded me of a noodle dish I had in university where it has a bold flavour and lots of meat.

pho was perfect. may have been the cold weather but lots of meat, flavourful, light and clean broth. can taste the freshness. onions and scallions included. tender as well.

for a pho place I'm definitely coming back especially when it tasted so well for me. hope more restaurants can open up in town as well."}
{"text":"Ahhh I was soooo excited to have a Vietnamese place in Stouffville finally.  I came here for the first time and here are my thoughts so far: 

1) Spring rolls: We ordered the fried spring rolls and unfortunately, there were way too many bean sprouts in there.  That's just not how they're supposed to be - I'm not sure if they were trying to cater to a more \"Western\" taste with the sprouts but I wasn't impressed.  Without the sprouts, it was actually quite good.  The fish sauce was, however, a little watered down and for them to just be starting out, you'd think they would have tried to start their game stronger. 

2) Pad Thai (beef): Again, way too many sprouts.  They also incorporated the sprouts.  The beef really lacked any flavour and the lowest quality cuts were used in there.  The pad thai had a bit of a kick of spice to it but really lacked in flavour - it was a bit bland. 

3) Chicken fried rice: The chicken fried rice was decent - they used white meat in there, which was nice.  I added fish sauce to a bit of the rice to make it a bit more flavourful but otherwise, it was okay 

To be quite honest, I really hyped myself up.  I think I finally thought there was going to be a decent Viet place here but as of right now, I think I still have to go down to Markham's Pho Metro.  I'm willing to give the actual Pho a try again but so far, I'm a bit underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Having eaten PHO in numerous restaurants, this is not very good. The vermicelli with beef was not really the bbq style served every where. It was thin strips thrown on a grill. Very disappointed, as the people running the restaurant seem very nice."}
{"text":"Vietnamese is Stouffville... Whaaaat? Yes people it has finally happened.

This place has only been open for a week and it is pretty busy. I have been here twice now and it is exactly what you would expect. No more driving to other areas for my Pho!!

I ate the Pho house special on the first visit.(Rare beef/tripe and beef balls)the broth was good. I was not disappointed. I have also eaten the cold shrimp spring rolls and the Vermicelli noodles with grilled beef, grilled pork and shrimp on bamboo. All dishes came quickly. The service is super friendly. I would say the people working here are very proud of their new establishment. Very clean.

I will be back again and again. Maybe I will see you there."}
{"text":"Now one can have a decent Vietnamese food in Stouffville. Pho Basil is welcome addition in the neighbourhood!!

Staff super friendly and enthusiastic enhanced the dining experience!

The interior is small but cozy. I did wait for 5 - 10 minutes when I dropped by for lunch.

Rare Beef Pho ($8)  has a good fragrant clear soup base which I really enjoyed. The portion size is good for the price! The large size might be too much for me. The beef though was really overcooked and lean which I did not like.

I am glad that Pho Basil can bring authentic Vietnamese food to this area. Not bad if you have a craving for Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Overall 3 stars but adding an extra star for service and the fact that it's located in STOUFFVILLE.
Lady owner was super friendly and accommodating. Service was fast and efficient. 
I had the grilled chicken with spring rolls vermicelli. Portion was large; chicken was perfectly done, not dry; spring roll was just ok. Vermicelli tasted refreshing for a summer day. 
I will come back to try the Pho"}
