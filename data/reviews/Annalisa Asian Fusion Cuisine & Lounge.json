{"text":"Service is ok, fish not fresh enough, like Derek comment, Chitose is fresher. Pho is the best one other forget it, especially Japanese food."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch  on a whim and very pleased I did. Nice decor.   Pleasant staff.   Lovely atmosphere.  Extensive Thai, Vietnamese and Japanese cuisine.  Please try the baked avocado.   I have got to get this recipe!"}
{"text":"The pad Thai was delicious, pho was not as good"}
{"text":"Had lunch here twice. especially love their spring roll - very authentic!
The spicy Thai beef noodles was great too!!"}
{"text":"This is my standard go to for all you can eat sushi in Aurora. The staff is friendly and remembers your preferenes when you're a regular.

The food is a slow to come out, but the quality of sushi is better then a few of the places I have tried in Aurora, which could be the reason why. 

While this place is a bit more costly at lunch, it is the same price for AYCE at dinner which is nice. There are also some fair maki specials if you don't need all you can eat but want a vairety of rolls.

They also serve thai and vietnamese dishes which is nice if you're feeling like sushi but your lunch date doesn't. Be careful how much you eat or you really will feel like sushi afterall."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Very clean and nice decor.   Would return for sure."}
{"text":"An AYCE sushi lunch for $21 should be outstanding, but this one misses the mark.  That would be in comparison to Golden Maki for $13, or Sushi Den for $16.  For example, Sushi Den includes sashimi, but here you add $5 making for a $26 AYCE.

Was the food exceptional?  No.  For example, the Salmon Hand Roll was soggy and only partially filled with salmon.  The sushi was heavy on rice.  The fish was fresh, but Chitose was fresher.  Red tuna was available, but it wasn't the rich red of fresher tuna.

Overall, this is not a bad restaurant, it just doesn't compare with others.  It would be a perfectly respectable AYCE for $14--not $21."}
{"text":"consistent and good, we always order from them and get delivery as well.  Good quality sushi and not cheap prices but the platters are great and start at $30 for 50 pieces, an extensive menu and they offer Thai and Viet dishes as well! we're local repeat customers!"}
{"text":"I had no clue this place even existed but when my friend suggested we give it a shot. She tried the all you can eat sushi and found a few things she hadn't tried. I had the pho (rare beef only) and was wonderfully surprised. 

The broth was light but flavorful, the meat served raw as it should be, and fresh greens and onions. 

I would certainly recommend a bowl if you are in the mood."}
{"text":"Neat place- has thai, japanese and vietnamese all rolled into one, and they were all done well.
Huge portions, food very nicely presented, very nicely prepared and was absolutely delicious.  Friendly staff, kitchy decor.  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Favourite sushi place hands down. Sushi comes out quick, staff is great, food is delicious. No complaints."}
