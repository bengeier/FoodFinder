{"text":"It's awesome that this place is it's open 24/7.  We've had a few specialty burgers and those are great, it's an actual burger and not something fake like at McDonalds.  The fried chicken is better than anything else you'll get in Lakewood fast food wise.  God help you if you decide to go to the KFC on 117th instead of this place, there's actually meat on the chicken and it's pretty damn good.  The best thing is every time I go there the guys are super friendly and kind.  Customer service is on point, I never dread going to pick something because they are always courteous and never treat you like your an annoying customer."}
{"text":"This place was terrible!! never coming here again!...... just kidding, it was the bomb! this ain't your average gas station food folks. Been here several times and have been satisfied with the food every visit! Would highly recommend the good burger, which is piled high with onion rings, mozzarella sticks, and grub sauce (similar to big mac sauce). even though I had about 8 heart attacks while eating it, still very delicious! plus they are open 24 hours, not sure if that applies to the kitchen as well."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I love to come here after I get out the bars  bc it's the only 24/7 place Ik that's good! Ps. Try the GRUB sauce"}
{"text":"I love the food selection here, I've ordered 3 different items on the menu on separate occasions, and all of it was delicious.

Shot sub- the quality of the steak on the sandwhich was great (not the cheap subway meat) with pastrami and a fried egg. Probably the greatest food creation put on the face of this earth.

Cheeseburger- the quality of the party also great, was cooked just right and I had turkey bacon and a fried egg. It's a fat mans dream

Fried chicken- it's unbelievable the selection of fried food that they have, chicken was the perfect golden crisp and had a great crunch. The jojo's or potato wedges had very nice flavor

Grub sauce- it is a house made sauce that I couldn't get enough of, I put it in all my food. I even asked for them to start bottling it up and selling it to me . They said hopefully in the near future"}
{"text":"This place has some great food. Friendly personable customer service . Clean and modern place. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Its real funny to rank a gas station 4 stars for food but my two food related experiences were just that...4 stars. 

Expectations met when I got the BOGO gyro special. Nothing to die over but pretty tasty and everything fresh. Their $4 for 10 wings...expectations exceeded. I asked for extra crispy and the guy knew what he was doing. He also took his time and really blended the wings and sauces together. He just didnt throw sauce on them..took his time...mixed some ingredients, coated them nicely, and aligned then in the container nicely. They were tasty and for 40 cents each, a true steal."}
{"text":"Just ordered here from UberEats, and boy was I impressed! When I ordered, I had no idea that it was a gas station. Wow!

$6 Double cheese burger was amazing!! - put in comments to add lettuce/tomato, and they did it no questions! Great deal!

For eats later I ordered 20 buffalo wings as well, called Wing Dings on the Uber Eats website. Thought maybe these were different than normal wings, given their name, but nope! Good ol' classic chicken wings! Very tasty, and didn't lose much being delivered.

I wish they would include an option to add ranch or blue cheese dressing to go with the wing dings, as I'm now sitting in my hotel with 20 wings, and no dipping sauce. In Cleveland on business quite often and will for sure order again. Thanks Grub Shack!"}
{"text":"well..ordered through skipthedishes.com..and the appetizers and others are 2 bucks more than presented..plus it was not a gyro..it was a pita and hamburger..dry..and for 3.99 i ordered potato wedges went all out at  i had 6 cold..soaked wedges..never again.smh"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! Witnessed several violations, but the worst of it is the guy cooking grabbed raw hamburger 4 times 4! Never changed his gloves once, never mind that he pulled up his gym shorts, or was drinking a open glass of water in the kitchen among many other things! Not to mention, we waited 25 minutes and never even started our food."}
{"text":"Chicken is always fresh and ready to go along with the cheapest gas in cleveland/lakewood most the time not your average gas station try it out the food one day you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"What sound do birds make? Cheap! Cheap!

This gas, and the petrol across the street at Circle K, is often cheaper than in the rest of Lakewood, and I've filled up here quite a few times when it was a few cents less than the Circle K (which it is right now, as of this writing... 2.25 versus 2.29). Lakewood isn't a cheap part of Cleveland to get gas in, but these 2 stations usually buck the trend. So unless you're down Akron way (where it's often 20 cents cheaper), this is where I'd get gas in the west burbs of CLE.

And despite the name Speedy, you can't buy methamphetamines here. Apologies."}
{"text":"I've had the hummus from the Sunoco in Olmsted Falls and enjoyed it so when I heard that Speedy's Grub Shack also sells it I knew I had to check this place out, especially since it is closer to me. 

I know a gas station doesn't seem like the best place to get food, I even read an article once where a lady ate nacho cheese from a gas station and got botulism, but that was is California, we Ohioans have sturdier stomachs. 

Anyways, I stopped in and picked up a dill pickle hummus and while I was there I decided to take advantage of the little kitchen area that they have. I wasn't sure what to order but got advice from staff and the couple in front of me who ordered this huge gyro and a corned beef sandwich that must have weighed more than a baby. They definitely do not skip when it comes to gut busting portion sizes. I decided to go with a chicken philly and a side of the cajun seasoned fries. 

Before I get into more details about the food, let me just say that everyone I interacted with was so just so friendly and pleasant! From the two employees to the couple of customers waiting for food just like me. Just some bonding over good food and banter that made us all chuckle. Also, the cook did an excellent job even with being so busy (they get a lot of walk-ins and UberEats orders). 

For the food well, after eating this gas station hummus that someone's aunt makes I don't eat store bought hummus anymore. The texture and flavor are just so much better! While I enjoyed the sample of special sauce I was given (kind of like Big Mac sauce), I preferred dipping my fries in the dill pickle hummus. The chicken philly was just okay, but still good enough that I want to explore other items on the menu. As for the menu, you're looking at fried things and sandwiches so don't expect fancy or healthy.

All in all I will be back! Good people at this gas station and I'd like to try the gyro and fried chicken! Mmm"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. Seriously this place rivals so many Lakewood bars bar food. Blows Sheets out of the water. They have Cleveland themed sandwiches. Chicken. And the grub sauce. Don't ever forget the grub sauce. Try something different and skip Taco Bell and swing by here. Guaranteed you'll be back. Everyone who works here is always super cool and friendly as well. Again the menu is huge and I've tried several sandwiches but not yet on the chicken which others rave about. I will be back and I will try. I def recommend trying this place for late night eats."}
{"text":"When I want to treat my self I go to Speedys. It's fast and fresh! Its always open so it can satisfy you any time!"}
{"text":"Speedy's has been my choice for several recent late night cravings.

The chicken tenders are amazing: big, tender, juicy, and flavorful.  I always buy them cooked to order, which only takes six minutes.  Also notable are the gyros.  The only thing I don't care for is the tzatziki sauce, solved by ordering with grub sauce and banana peppers, which was delicious.  I have also tried the Philly steak, a huge sandwich made the Philadelphia way with the meat and cheese chopped up and mixed together.  Yum!

Staff is always friendly, and I think always trying their hardest to make the food as perfect as possible.  Be sure to tip!"}
{"text":"We called to do a pickup order and the person on the phone asked if it was a \"big order\"? We said we just want to do a couple of burgers . They told us to hold on . Someone else got on the phone and said we don't have any burgers because the burgers are frozen. Well of course the burgers are frozen . Most fast food burgers are frozen . The place advertises pick up and delivery, but we were turned off by them telling us we couldn't get burgers Bc they were frozen . I'll go get my food from the Get Go gas station instead ."}
{"text":"Best local gyro!  Fast service. Convenient location. You won't expect it to be good but the gyro here rocks!!!!!  Oh!, you can get some gas or beer too."}
{"text":"Super convenient and made to order. Chili cheese fries were still crispy upon arrival. Uber eat"}
{"text":"Ordered for the Super bowl these guys really take care of you. Food was super fresh and prepared professionally. We're ordered about 200 wings and a 6 foot sub. It was amazing."}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab grub.. I like the grub sauce on the burger! The burger deal which is only 6 dollars, you can't beat it with a stick, I  use to like circle K but the grub  here is hands down way better and fresh! I would recommend it to my worst enemy,  stop on in you won't regret it.. Bomb digitty"}
{"text":"Very good food and pleasant atmosphere food was fresh and made fast and delicious, very nice updated place will be back soon"}
{"text":"Cheapest gas in town, and it's a great location. There is a little to-go food place inside called the grub shack that has hot food items, and the shelves are well stocked with snacks. Quite a step up from the old Marathon in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Honestly? Not bad for gas station food. Had it delivered by UberEATS at about 2am. They ran out of jalapeño poppers though. 4 stars."}
{"text":"Open on Christmas! I didn't have time to go to the grocery the other day so there's no decent meal in the fridge---and it's Christmas! I whipped out my phone and checked which restaurants are open; I used UberEats. Anyway, Speedy's was open. I ordered a po boy, chicken wings, and chicken tenders!

Servings were huge! The wings were decent- not as crispy as I want it to be, and needed more seasoning (personal preference). I guess it would be tastier if we got the speedy sauce with it---we ordered one speedy sauce (extra $1.00), but it was missing in our order. Also, on UberEats, we ordered a 2L bottle of diet pepsi, but we only got a small bottle for $3.00. Pretty expensive for a small pop.

 Other than the snafu with the wings,sauce, and the overpriced small diet pepsi, the hubs liked the po boy, and the kids found the chicken tenders \"tasty\". 

Are we going to give it another try? Maybe. Any time soon? Not sure."}
{"text":"Honestly really good food.  I feel bad for people that go to Taco Bell late night. This is gourmet compared to them!!!!"}
{"text":"I was drunk a couple weekends ago. I went to Speedy's Grub Shack. Friends have been raving about the 24 hour grub served at this gas station. I will be moving across the street from here, God willing and the creek don't rise and if seller of the house I am buying complies with my demands. I am hoping to return to Lakewood the way LeBron returned to Cleveland from Miami. They have gentrified me once again from Tremont. The gyro is good. The chicken tenders are battered and fried onsite. A great number of friends have stated the cheese steak sandwich is good. The burger combo for $6 is a good deal. The staff is friendly. Lakewood Heights Blvd is the most slept on street in all of Lakewood. Best tacos in Cleveland at La Plaza. Best shawarma at Ferris Deli. Best hillbilly bar at Kelley's Pub. And best gas station food served 24-7 at Speedy's Grub Shack."}
{"text":"This is a gas station on the outside and a deli on the inside! Def wayyyyy more food options than your typical \"gas station\" and they sell homemade  hummus from the Sunoco in Olmsted Falls, any Cleveland foodie is gonna know about \"gas station hummus\"- I stopped in here to grab some hummus and also got a gyro. The gyro meat was crisp (which I love!!) and the food was prepared hot & fast- the gentleman making my gyro was pleasant. There's a menu with a variety of deep fried foods, subs and snacks to order. There's also your typical gas station supply of chips, coke, and magazines. Location is very convenient- it's literally right next to I-90."}
