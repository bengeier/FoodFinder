{"text":"I've been to Tuvalu (formerly Indigo) more times that I can count and love it even though I don't drink coffee. We love their food and drinks, as well as checking out the local artists' gallery and the fair trade gift shop. Tuvalu also seems to be a hit with the kids, with a train table and dollhouse for the younger ones and games for the older ones."}
{"text":"My Wife and I stopped in Sunday around noon for a cup of coffee, The lady working in the kitchen area looked up from her tasks and didn't say anything.  We waited another 5 minutes before the waitress greeted us and referred us to the menu. We waited another 5 minutes for her to finish gabbing with a regular and decided to leave. While we were waiting the 10 minutes I noticed the lady in the Kitchen wearing a tank top was sweating and wipped her brow with her hand, then proceeded to finish that customers order... Gross! This is the second bad visit we've had in a row at Tuvalu and we won't have our time wasted there again."}
{"text":"Ordered a bottomless regular coffee (very good), a spicy mocha (pretty good), and a breakfast sandwich (just ok). The kids play area is a big plus. I was able to eat while my child played contently. However the food was only so-so for the price. Almost $6 for a microwaved sandwich. Sticking to just coffee next time. Cute shop though."}
{"text":"Over all good food. It was a pricy for what I got but I love the feel of the place and the art is beautiful! Great coffee beverages also."}
{"text":"I stopped by recently and had a great experience! Iced mocha with dark chocolate and soy milk was YUMMM. Got the boyfriend an iced coffee which he liked too.  Tuvalu has a really nice, chill vibe to it. Service was good, the decor is pleasant, and the place very spacious. I truly enjoyed my afternoon there. Great place to just hang out with friends, do some work, bring the kids or simply get good coffee/tea/even art&crafts."}
{"text":"Just happened into this cute popular place!  Wonderful lattes and my favorite kind of lunches - salads, sandwiches and wraps. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Try their mocha. It's genuinely good. The place has a relaxed, homely atmosphere which works very well with the whole independent coffee shop thing."}
{"text":"For the record I hate giving negative reviews, and I want to support local businesses. Tuvalu has good coffee and food. Lucky for me there is a coffee shop across the street.   I've stopped in several times in the past few months and can't say I've had a good experience with their staff. They are always stand offish, borderline rude. On top of which, the other day I watch as they deliberately made my order wrong since they had a certain type of milk out. I've been working in the coffee business for 10 years, I can tell if you if you made something I ordered or not.   I'm bummed but I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Great coffee in a laid back atmosphere. Nice kids area where little ones can play. Also has a little store in the back with artwork and jewelry from local artists."}
{"text":"Stupid new $5 minimum for credit cards. Never mind starbucks has built an empire charging people the same prices for coffee. I went down the street to quick trip and got the same thing for $ .50"}
{"text":"Their Basil Lemonade is the bomb. The. Bomb. Not too sweet, and it tastes freshly made. Delicious.  Their food wasn't too shabby, either. I had the Asparagus Quiche, which was tasty but had a bit too much cheese for my taste. I also got an iced coffee, which was pretty good.  Two points: Tuvalu is a great place to bring young, toddler-aged children. They have a wooden train set, chalk board, and other amenities that keep younger children occupied so that their parents are able to relax and enjoy a cup of coffee. However, I found the service there to be rather slow. We waited maybe ten minutes for our food, and I also had to wait what seemed like a long time for both of the drinks I ordered -- iced coffee and lemonade! They only had two people working there: one who made the food, one who made the drinks.   I would definitely stop in again if I was a parent with young children, because Tuvalu is the ideal place to bring them. However, if I wanted to work remotely or stop in for a drink to go, I might go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great little coffee house on Main Street and maybe 200 feet off of military ridge bike path.  Serves many local products.  The house made kombucha is delicious. There are a variety of pastries as well.  Staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee shop and cafe. Nicest staff and delicious food. Wow - definitely worth a stop every time you are in Verona."}
{"text":"Wow, reading the other reviews here, I can't understand how I had such a horrible experience at Tuvalu. It almost makes me want to give them another shot. Almost, because the place was so obviously mismanaged resulting is such abysmal value and customer service that I can't imagine ever leaving another dollar there.   We were really expecting a decent lunch after reading reviews, checking out the menu online, and walking in to see such a nice, welcoming space. It was about 1:30 on a beautiful sunday afternoon. It seemed like everything was in our favor. Right until we started ordering. The first thing I tried to order they couldn't make because they'd run out of tabouleh. Okay, places run out of things, no sweat. While I was re-deciding, I heard the clerk tell another customer they were out of tuna. I settled on the Tuvalu salad, at which point the clerk yelled over her shoulder, \"Hey, do we have enough greens to make a salad?\" After considering a head of leaf lettuce in a grocery store bag, they decided that yes, they could make me a salad.  We also ordered iced tea, which they were out of, and told us it would be 10 minutes for them to make more. We decided that would be fine. We felt bad for them.   So, we took our seats at a table, perused the gift shop area, which seemed to have nice things, and waited. And waited, and waited. There seemed to be an insane amount of activity going on in the kitchen area considering that there were about 5 people in the whole place and zero food coming out. Eventually our drinks came. About 15 minutes after that, we finally got our sandwich and salad, which were quite frankly pathetic. First, I could have prepared these things in about 90 seconds in my home kitchen. The salad wasn't even tossed! It was, for $8, a small plate of green leaf lettuce (not what I think of when I read \"organic greens\" on a menu), 4 giant unpeeled cucumber slices, a few slices of feta, and a pile of sunflower seeds and dried cranberries. On the side was a plastic cup of some kind of creamy dressing from a bottle that was certainly not the advertised balsamic vinegarette. My husband's sandwich was basically as advertised, besides missing the tomato that was supposed to be on it. Maybe they were out of tomatoes too and didn't feel like admitting that THEY JUST WEREN'T PREPARED TO MAKE FOOD THAT DAY. It came with a pile of lettuce similar to mine with the same silly dressing. We grimly ate and got out of there as fast as we could. What a waste.   Whoever runs this place clearly has no idea what they're doing. They were out of everything and it took so long to prepare our food that there can't have been any prep work done ahead of time. I hate to see  small business fail, but I just can't see clear to tell anyone to spend money here. $25 for essentially a side salad, a grilled cheese sandwich, and 2 iced teas. Ugh."}
{"text":"Bring  cash if you just want a cup of coffee.  $5 minimum order for credit cards .  Nice atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Tuvalu sells bulk Just Coffee beans and for this fact alone I'm a regular here.  This place has an excellent vibe to it like any great coffeehouse should.  I generally don't have time to get my coffee to stay, so I've not really had the chance to spend some time relaxing at a table or out on the porch - too bad on my part.  My usual routine is to walk in, grab a couple pounds of bulk beans, then fill up my traveler and get my punchcard stamped and pay.  On a good day I'm in and out within ten minutes.  In addition to coffee and bulk beans there's a small pastry case that has pre-wrapped items that can be either prepared there or taken with.  The breakfast burritos are pretty good, but my favorite is the spinach-stuffed croissant.  In addition to the usual coffee card (buy 10 get 1) they offer a bulk card - buy 5 lbs. and get a half pound free.    Parking can sometimes be a bit of a concern - yesterday I ended up circling the block searching for a spot.  It's located just up from Miller's and there aren't a ton of parking stalls in the lot, but during the summer the bike racks seem to be always full so keep that in mind if you're local.  Given the fact there was no parking I shouldn't have been surprised to see a long line of customers upon entering.  I don't generally order special coffee drinks but I do believe the baristas at Tuvalu may not be the quickest at turning around orders.  This doesn't usually concern me, but I did get stuck in line for the better part of fifteen minutes yesterday.  Aside from the coffee-related offerings I've found a good number of last-minute gifts at Tuvalu.  They've got a decent assortment of glass and pottery items crafted by local and international artists.  I've gotten a few really great presents just on a whim, including a set of hand-blown glass coasters and a tea set.  There's always FTO chocolate bars as well, just waiting for an impulse buy.  I also get pure Wisconsin maple syrup from Cazenovia, which even comes in a mapleleaf-shaped bottle - it's one of my father's favorite things and tastes especially good on buckwheat pancakes.  I've never gone here for lunch as I'm usually passing through Verona on my way down to my parents' place, but the sandwich specials advertised on the board by the counter have always looked pretty good.  Some day I'm sure I'll find out for certain, but until then I'll keep coming back for the excellent coffee."}
{"text":"Great little hipster coffee spot.   I've frequented for specialty coffees a few different times now. If you like flavor, this coffee house doesn't cheat you one bit. I've had the black and white latte, caramel latte, and the sticky...sticky something (caramel and toffee nut).   Pastries galore! They have a menu for breakfast items and a quick bite for lunch. Buy your own drip coffee is available if you're in a hurry. Place $2 in a bucket grab a cup and head out.   Great seating available. Several flyers posted of randomness. A good amount of trinkets and of course coffee related items to purchase. The baristas are always very friendly and pleasant. It would be nice to have a drive thru since it is located along a busy street or even a loyalty perk (punch cards). I'm a sucker for coffee perks!"}
{"text":"I love buying FAIR TRADE, ORGANIC, and LOCAL. This super cute coffee and tea house has all three!   My mom lives only a few blocks from Tuvalu. Lucky!! I have driven by many times and wanted to check it out. So when my brother suggested lunch before my drive back to \"the big city\", I suggested this spot.  Wouldn't you know...I was the hero once again. *proud beaming smile*  We walked into the spacious digs and immediately began roaming the plethora of handmade goods lining the store. Blown glass, brooms, framed and unframed artwork, tons of jewelry, bowls, kids woven sweaters, vases, honey, hot chocolate powder and the list goes on... It's awesome and they are all fair trade and local. Yippee!  Oh yeah..and the food was good too. I had a grilled cheese (cheddar)panini (on cracked wheat bread) which came with tomato plus I added turkey and avacado. It was only $7.25 and SO melty good. Really. The best sandwich I have had in a while. I paired my sandwich with their organic blueberry tea which was enticing everyone at my table with its fruity aroma.   All of my family members enjoyed their selections. Not a bite left on the plates! The women behind the counter were BUSY, but managed to remain friendly and kind. Love that!   PLEASE COME CHECK OUT TUVALU COFFEEHOUSE. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."}
{"text":"The best latte I have had...spicy mocha (dark chocolate and cayenne pepper).  Tingly! Good price too"}
{"text":"I have stopped in several times in the mornings and for lunch. Last time in we tried their new breakfast burritos which were generously sized, eggs, potatoes and bacon.  Friends had the oatmeal which came with extra toppings. Lunch is always good, excellent sandwiches and soup.  You won't leave feeling hungry. The coffee has never disappointed me."}
{"text":"I visited here several times while on a business trip to Verona. The coffee was great as well as the lunch. While I enjoyed the quiche loraine, I got this for an early morning breakfast and was surprised it still came with salad. Other than that, I enjoyed hanging out here to get out of my hotel and enjoyed the coffee as well as the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tuvalu's staff was very friendly. But their menu is hard to read, (too much color and unorganized) their prices are on the higher end, and my latte was just ok. There was a little bit longer of a wait that I am used to for coffee. I probably wont be back for their coffee. But they have the cutest little gift shop area in the back of the cafe that I will be going back to for a few gifts. I'd say check it out if you're in the area and have time to burn."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place... we stayed in Verona for the night before we drove further north. I knew from the reviews that this place had the vibe we were looking for- and would be cyclist friendly. I wasn't wrong, they are biker friendly but the food was just so disappointing.  It's a cafe with a knick knack shop and a toddler play area in it. Fine. We came for food and caffeine. The menu seemed to have some good stuff on it and there were definitely people coming in for drinks. We were hungry so we ordered two breakfast burritos. Not sure if they were short staffed, but once I saw the burrito and the microwave set up I got nervous.  We waited and waited and finally got breakfast. The burritos were terrible. I understand that they don't have a full kitchen and that it wouldn't exactly be fresh made but they were bad and  I regret spending the money. The tea and coffee were fine. The wait was just odd. No thanks."}
{"text":"Superb Coffee shop. Very nice place, great bakery goods, excellent coffee, and also always has reliable wifi."}
{"text":"I love this eclectic coffee shop! I always go in the AM but would love to check out their live music at night. I don't give them a solid 5 because their small food portions, while delicious, are over priced. Their 5 bite burritos are $6. But if you can afford buying two, do it!"}
{"text":"Love it. Everything is delicious and everyone is friendly. Feels like the kind of coffee shop I would come across in a quaint vacation town and wish we had at home (if that makes sense?). Love the kids play area."}
{"text":"I've been meeting my friends here once a month to chat over coffee.  Each time I've visited, I've never wanted to leave!  The atmosphere is relaxing and hip, and the coffee is super tasty.  This past visit, I had a shot of regular and a shot of decaf expresso in my latte in one of their adorable mugs.  Delicious!  I would love to return and eat breakfast one of these visits.  I know that Tuvalu has a fun play area for kids, so it would also be a great place for moms with little ones to visit."}
{"text":"Stopped in while on road trip. The latte I had was a perfect pickup for my long drive, so delicious!  The staff is also very friendly. They have a  gift shop that I hope to spend more time in when I pass thru again."}
{"text":"I like Tuvalu. I've been to many MANY coffee houses (my husband and collect them like trading cards), and I've got a pretty set criteria of what I want them to be.   Tuvalu has a lot of neat things. I wouldn't call it as \"trendy\" as the shops on the East side of Madison, but it is a comforting sort of place. It feels very homey from the moment you walk in. Tuvalu also includes a really cool little shop of handmade items ranging from artwork to jewelry to household items that serve as a fun gallery even if you're not interested in buying. There are lots of fun things to look at, and the artwork within the shop (also for sale) seems to rotate fairly regularly as well.  On Fridays, Tuvalu also regularly offers various acts. We came for a father-daughter team that offered a lot of current hits, often performed in a more soft-rock style well-suited to a coffee shop atmosphere.   Tuvalu also offers food, which is always something I appreciate in a coffee shop atmosphere. Some of their items are better than others, although I haven't had much. Some tasty items I've tried have included a spiced muffin and an EXCELLENT chocolate peanut butter pie. I was somewhat more disappointed by the breakfast burrito, which was small and had what tasted like canned salsa inside it. I have yet to try any sandwiches or larger items in order to comment on those. Coffee drinks (lattes) were decent but not exceptional.   Overall, a very solid shop that most definitely has a great small-town feel. It also seems like it is a great neighborhood gathering place--people coming into the shop are often familiar with the owners/employees."}
{"text":"Best coffee shop anywhere.  Fair trade coffee and local arts and crafts.  Check out coffee bar soaps and lip balms while you're there.  Best best best."}
{"text":"This is really a very nice coffee shop.  There is a gift shop and some unique coffee selections.   I haven't always had the best cup of joe here though so I have to drop it to 4 stars. Up one star for their support of the protest at the State Capitol.  Thanks Tuvalu!!  You have my business."}
{"text":"awesome chai lattes and breakfast burritos. I love the local artwork as well. and great music! I definitely will be back!! :-)"}
{"text":"They are lined up for food and coffee. I enjoyed my quiche, though it was warmed up.  amazing brownie!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here, I had an hour to kill and wanted coffee. I yelped the closest place and this was it. I am so happy I found this place! I love it!!!! They have fair trade coffee, many organic snacks, and homemade kombucha!! I've read some reviews about it being expensive, and I'm sure that's because their coffee is fair trade, which I don't mind paying extra for. The place is very colorful and comfy. They even have a little bit of a shop with fair trade, homemade gifts! I absolutely love this place, and I would highly recommend! I'm so happy I stumbled upon this coffee shop!"}
{"text":"We just stopped in on a cold, but sunny morning, on our bicycles to warm up with a latte and muffin. Hadn't read the previous reviews, but our experience was good. The lattes were good and served promptly, and the pumpkin muffin was excellent. I will go back again."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  The coffee is good, but you may have to wait a bit for it.  Cool place with occasional music as well.  Probably the only thing keeping me from giving this place another star is that no matter my mood going in, I come out a bit lower.  I am grumpy enough before I have my morning Joe, I don't need my barista going all Eeyore on me and bringing me down even further.  Cheer up, I am buying your coffee."}
{"text":"Tuvalu is a great little coffee shop that does good food and has good local live entertainment regularly. Love them."}
{"text":"Tuvalu is just ok.   The positive: cool vibe, small child's play area, local artwork, live music.  The negative: Service is a bit off sometimes, food is good but not excellent."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The good: good drinks and lots of seating space. The bad: 1)customer service  2) high prices (especially food items) 3) confussing chalkboard menu 4) no designated spot to get your drink 5)cash-only for drinks under $5 (drinks like plain coffees and small lattes)"}
{"text":"We were on the hunt for a good coffee rescue, and were pleasantly surprised by this local cafe. The broccoli and cheddar quiche was a nice bonus. Nice gift shopping area, very helpful and cheerful staff, and an array of comfortable seating. And, a very clean bathroom."}
{"text":"Loved the coffee! The food was pretty good. But the owner could use a better attitude. After all I just paid $20 for two small sandwiches."}
{"text":"Four shot dirty chai - amazing. Good find. Looks like a warm environment with super friendly and welcoming service. Looks like a great breakfast nook for a family. Cool fair trade sales of jewelry and miscellaneous items. Adding to favorites!"}
{"text":"Adorable coffee house. Love their fall drinks. Pumpkin chai...mmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"I like the homey feel of Tuvalu. The coffee is wonderful and the gallery is fantastic. The only negative thing about this location is that Moms seem to think its okay for their little ones to wander around and play."}
{"text":"I stop in to Tuvalu once a week for some hot coffee and a delicious bacon breakfast burrito.  Served with a side of salsa, this little gem is a great way to start the day!  I usually enjoy my breakfast and drinking a bottomless cup of joe Friday mornings when I can read the newest addition of the Isthmus."}
{"text":"2 stars for the comfy couch and the 1st cashier. (Explained in review)  My first time to TCH. Ordered a bottomless coffee as I planned on being there for awhile. Found a couch and was getting settled in. I decided to order a salad -- got the harvest grilled chicken salad omit the cranberries and bread as I am on a low carb diet. The tomatoes were delicious but the chicken tasted like it was reheated in a microwave as it had that dried chewy texture. The salad as on a small plate and so I couldn't mix the dressing on it. Not impressive for $8.  A meeting with an employee and 2 gentlemen started taking place moments after I finished. They had the option to close the door but chose not to so it was too loud to read. I decided to leave. Went to go get a coffee cup to go and 2nd cashier (hadn't seen her before) was quite snooty when I said I would like a large cup since I paid for bottomless. \"I can't do that\" with an irritated look on her face. The thing was, I had only drank a half a cup of of coffee and paid for bottomless. She said the best she could do was give me a medium and I poured the rest of my cup in that and topped it with fresh coffee. It's irritating that she gave me such a hard time about a to go cup when I spent over $14 there for a crap salad and a coffee.  Won't go back."}
