{"text":"The wings were so bad I had to make an account to write the review. Do yourself a favor do not get food from here."}
{"text":"Waited in a line of four people for fifteen minutes while cashier struggled to take orders. Got so bad that a guy in the kitchen was shouting, \"what are you guys ordering\" so they could actually get food out. 
I ordered a pork shoulder sandwich combo (sandwich, fries, drink, was charged around $8).
When my order came out, it didn't have fries. I asked for them but the cashier just got more flustered so I let it be. 

When I opened my sandwich though, it was mush. Literal mush. The one small scoop of cold, wet pork had soaked the slices of white bread to the consistency of raw dough.
It was inedible.

Just toast the bread!

Walked back but the other customers were already complaining as well,  so I still let it go. 

Barbecue is so easy. I hope they figure it out."}
{"text":"I work in Tower City and decided to try this place. I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the 3 peice snack and it was delicious! The wings were crispy, and the oil that they cooked them in seemed to be fresh. The fries were light and perfectly cooked. I ordered a side of baked beans and they were spot on! Sweet, thick, tender and good. The \"sauce\" was too tangly in my opinion but was tasty. I paid $7.5 for three whole wings, and handful of fries and 1/3 cup of baked beans...a little overpriced, but I would buy it again."}
{"text":"I had a whole rack of bbq ribs for $22 and 2 sides.  I chose fries and baked beans.  The sauce was great and that is about it.  The ribs were so so because the meat could be a bit softer.  The fries are average and the baked beans tasted like from a can.  Overall it was disappointing but I can see it being somewhat a fast bbq fix spot."}
{"text":"Food was ok...Nothing special. However I couldn't believe they served me old and stale bread. On top of that I paid close to $4 for a cake and it was also stale and extremely small. You ripped me off once but trust me when I tell you it won't happen again."}
{"text":"While in Ohio for a wedding a group of us took a train to Cleveland. The train station is also a mall with food court and most of us decided to get something at Anderson's BBQ. This proved to be a big mistake on most everyone's part. 

First off, you're in a food court on a Friday before Memorial Day at lunchtime. Not to mention on this day there is an Indians game as well as a Cavs playoff game (basketball, right?). I'd think you'd have more than two employees. Apparently, Anderson's didn't think this prudent or they had bad luck with employees calling out this particular day.  Either way, there was one lady at the register and a guy in the back. To be fair, the cook in the back seemed to be going as fast as he could. He was just back there by himself. 

I ordered a 1/4 lb. cheeseburger. It was a wait, but the burger itself was acceptable. Everyone else had to wait a while for their food but I heard no complaints except that the baked beans tasted like it came from a can. 

My boyfriend's uncle waited an unnecessary amount of time for his two burgers, but the worst wait was for my boyfriend's pulled pork sandwich. At one point the cashier even asked him what he'd ordered. Many people that had gotten there and ordered after us got their food before he did. A woman trying to make a decision of where to eat approached my boyfriend and asked him if he'd been waiting. He looked at the time he'd placed his order on his receipt and told her he'd been waiting exactly half an hour. She understandably decided to save herself similar heartbreak and went elsewhere. 

I was really hoping for his sake his sandwich would be the most amazing thing he ever put in his mouth. No such luck. What the hell kind of place makes a pulled pork sandwich with white bread?  Shit was soggy as fuck. 

Do you think there was an apology for his wait or at least an offer to get half his money back?  Free refill of his drink?  Nope. 

Save yourself the trouble."}
{"text":"It was a little after 7pm, and everyone else is closing.  Not the fastest place in the world, the Shoulder Sandwich, which is actually pulled pork, is not that bad.  It is on bread, not a bun.  They will ask you if you want BBQ Sauce, it is not BBQ Sauce.  It is still pretty good.  They will ask if you want cole slaw, make sure you say on the side, you will find it on your sandwich.  Not really awesome, nothing to write home about, but if you cannot find anything else, this place is all right.  Coleslaw is not the kind I care for, but you might like it.  Baked beans seem tasty.  The wings, pretty skimpy.  If you have time to go somewhere you may want to try somewhere else.  This place is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"So I decided to stop by here today for lunch...bad idea. I ordered the perch sandwich with fries. This order took so long that I contemplated just leaving. There was one person cooking another helping them bag the orders and another at the register. So after the long wait I sat down and ate the food. Let me tell you it was the blandest fish sandwich I ever had and the fries were hella dry even with ketchup on them. Only saving grace was the person at the register seemed to be nice. I wont be back though!!!"}
