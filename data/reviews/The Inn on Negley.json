{"text":"Went for brunch with a group of ladies and we had a great time!  The inn is really lovely and it's a great if you want to try something new or different for brunch!

Service is impeccable and the whole atmosphere is just so elegant!  The brunch service is basically a four course meal: fruit, breads, entree, dessert!  And you also have you choice of juices, coffee and/or tea!

All the things we tried were delicious!  There were so many things, I can barely remember.  


They also serve Afternoon Tea, which I'm sure is fabulous!!! So, that's definitely next on my list!"}
{"text":"The attention to detail at the Inn on Negley is simply impeccable! We had high tea here a couple of days before Christmas, and it was everything we hoped it would be! The overall experience put us in a festive mood and we look forward to going back again in the future! The service was outstanding, the tea delicious, and the Christmas decorations were quite lovely. The tea sandwiches, scones and desserts are why I gave the rating of four out of five stars. They were good, but could have been a tad more tasty. I agree with another review on here that the bread on the tea sandwiches was a little stale. We enjoyed the scones, but they could have had a little more flavor to them. And I would have preferred a different dessert choice other than a small heart shaped sugar cookie, which went along with a bite of gingerbread cake and a chocolate truffle. All in all, we went for the experience and the Inn on Negley more than delivered! The innkeepers were there and were very friendly and gracious. We took a tour of the inn, which is one of the original Shadyside mansions, and the rooms were elegant and filled with beautiful antiques. Again, the attention to detail in each room is like no other. I would love to stay there one day! We will definitely be back for tea in the future!"}
{"text":"First time having Afternoon tea time in the States. This place is very beautifully decorated. We had the Earl Grey and peach ginger tea. They were really good and the tea stand was AMAZING"}
{"text":"I often travel back to Pittsburgh for business, and have stayed in most of the hotels near Oakland and Shadyside; The Inn on Negley is by far my favorite place to stay. Great breakfast, great staff, great wifi, and overall an amazing experience.

Also, try out the high tea if you get a chance, definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I requested a stay at the Inn on Negley when traveling on business back to Pittsburgh.  I lived in town for 5 years and had not had an opportunity to return in more years than that I am afraid. This place was just what I needed. I sought a more personal experience than a canned commercial hotel could offer.

I was so grateful to get to stay in this pristine, classy, comfortable Inn. The staff was welcoming, sweet, helpful, and kind. The room was lovely. 

The best part was waking up in the morning! Breakfast made me feel like a queen on her birthday. The food was perfect. Gorgeous and delicious. The carefully cut fresh fruit salad, coffee, french toast option, and housemade pastries were top shelf! The  creative meals and fresh ingredients were professionally planned, carefully prepared, and out of this world! 

I bought my host a gift certificate for brunch in thanks just so he could share in how fabulous the treatment is. I'd return in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Went to a High Tea here on Sunday.  Although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming, the food was nothing special, in fact, it was bad.  We were served three tea sandwiches:  egg salad, which was bland (I make a better version at home), chicken salad, nothing special either, and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite.  Unfortunately, it was the size of a quarter, it was literally a bite.  But it was the best part of the meal!!!  (I don't think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread).

We were offered two types of scones:  cranberry and eggnog.   Neither was anything special, eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoever!

Then, the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop!  A pumpkin torte, again, fine.  And a chocolate mousse/brownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone!  It looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white, mouse separated from brownie.  Yuck.  

Oh yeah--I had a delicious tea from Harney and Sons (used to be sold at the Grand Floridian High Tea in Disney World), cinnamon spice!!!  Unfortunately, when I asked for more tea, they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag! 

I've gone to various teas so I feel I can give a good comparison.  Not impressed at all!  Will not go back there, ever!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a unique place to try for brunch this is the place to go.  Nestled in Shadyside on Negley Avenue don't drive by too fast as you could easily miss the small sign out front.  The Victorian home is a bed and breakfast and the rooms are beautiful with privates bath. I would love to stay sometime.  I have gone twice for Sunday brunch and both times have been absolutely amazing. While the food is delicious the experience of a eating a 4 course brunch  in a old Victorian home is worth the price. For $23 a person, the brunch includes a starter, pastries, entrée, dessert and unlimited tea, coffee or juice. The tea list is extensive and I recommend the mint chocolate-tastes just like the ice cream.  On our last trip we started with a small bowl of fruit followed by the pastry selections-these are always fresh and made in house.  This time it was lemon poppy seed bread and cranberry muffins. They were both absolutely scrumptious and I was wanting more as you only get a small sample.  Next up we got to pick our entrée-they don't have a menu and usually have 4 choices and then eggs any style. I went with the goat cheese, asparagus and leek omelet with potatoes and turkey bacon (loved that this was an option).  My date ordered the hash with poached eggs and regular bacon.  The omelet was amazing and had such great flavor.  For dessert we were all given extremely cute lady bug sugar cookies. The service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Pricey but worth it. They have a huge selection of teas, different options for milk if you like milk in your tea like me, and they're flexible if you have vegan or vegetarians in your group. Everything we tried was delicious, but the vibe is even better. It's in a home but everything is perfectly decorated and the China they use makes you feel like you're at a very upscale tea party. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I recently had High Tea here, and it was wonderful. The Harney & Sons cinnamon spice tea is incredible. It's a loose leaf tea, and even though I've tried to make my own at home, it just tastes better here. The tea room area is very charming, and our party of 5 was seated at a large round table, which was perfect for our hours (literally) of conversation over tea and delicious food. My group had several food allergies, including soy and nut allergies and gluten free. The chefs here accommodated everyone because it's all made in-house. Our waiter couldn't have been more kind and helpful. He was very informative (we asked a ton of questions), never rushed us (we talked for hours), always brought out new kettles of hot water, and he even took a picture (actually, several) for us (yes, we are THOSE people)."}
{"text":"I was the lucky birthday girl at a surprise High Tea party for eight at The Inn on Negley.  The service is as good as it gets.  We placed our first tea order (you can change it up however many times you like!) then the chef came out to explain the food she had made.  For our first tier we had chicken salad sandwich, egg salad sandwich, and cucumber dill crostini things.  The second tier had two types of scones and cantaloupe slices.  The third tier was mini cupcakes, brownies, and strawberries and cream sandwich type things.  Even though the food did not look like a lot it really was filling.     

The atmosphere was beautiful and comfortable.  Not stuffy or too formal at all.  We felt comfortable having a good time while being ultra ladylike.  The place settings were very pretty and just what I expected.  

The only reason I did not give The Inn on Negley 5 stars is that some of the food was better than others.  The egg salad sandwich was dry, bland and the bread was a bit stale.  The chicken salad sandwich, however, was the BEST chicken salad I've ever had.  

High Tea is definitely worth the experience at The Inn on Negley!  I'd love to go back and stay in a room for a little close to home treat some day."}
{"text":"One afternoon I begged my husband to take me out for tea. He was curious as to what was so special about high tea. I briefed him on tea sandwiches and treats and quickly insisted it was a 'girl thing' and suggested I should have a girls day out. I wasn't upset that he didn't want to go and was so happy I got to experience the cuteness with my gal pals.

Upon entering this beautiful Victorian home, I was greeted with a warm welcome. That's always nice! They offered to take my coat and insisted we tour the house before tea time. I obliged! The house is stunning to say the least. I wouldn't mind having a staycation there!

Once seated, they explained to us that each person gets their own pot of tea with a choice of two teas! The chef came out with a three tiered platter with sandwiches on the top, scones in the middle, and sweet treats at the bottom. All were quite delicious! Based on the pictures on yelp, it looks like the varieties change. Although the tea service is kind of pricey ($25/person), it was worth it.

The service was excellent. The food looked like it wouldn't be enough for me but I was surprised I wasn't craving a steak afterwards. It was perfect. The tea was ok. My favorite is the vanilla creme. I also had the green tea and was disappointed. Usually I like green tea but this was a bit bitter than I would have liked. There were other choices that sounded more appealing. But hey, it gives me a reason to go back! 

My overall impression of the Inn and their tea service was excellent! I'd definitely go back for another girls day out. I think it can also be a great place to have a bridal shower, baby shower, or take your mom out for tea on Mother's Day. Super adorable!"}
{"text":"The Inn is wonderful! I've been in every room and they are all wonderful-spacious, luxurious and sparkling clean. We stayed twice in the Empire. It's sooo comfortable. The bed has great linens and the jacuzzi fit both my husband and I , albeit was tight! 
The downstairs room is huge and great for folks who will have difficulty w the stairs (no elevator-3rd floor's a hike). It is however right next to the check-in area. Room pictures on website are exactly as shown. Breakfast was top notch! Chef Cody & Joshua couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. Worth every penny! 
To add-it's so nice to walk down the street and enjoy great little shops and cafes :)"}
{"text":"Without a doubt one of the nicest places I have ever had the pleasure of laying my head...

...having wine and cheese...

....or breakfasting.

The Inn on Negley is gorgeously appointed.  The individual rooms, all named for varieties of apple, are spectacular.  We were in the lovely Northern Spy.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable, the linens unbelievably soft and luxurious.  L'Occitane bath products smelled divine.  The Shadyside neighborhood outside of downtown is quiet but still conveniently located to all the Pittsburgh doings.

Breakfast each morning, cooked by the hospitable Chef Jackie, is pure pleasure.  Each night on your pillow a menu card appears; check off what you'd like in the morning, what time you'll be eating, and drop it off in the dining room.  The next day, Jackie is ready and waiting with a fresh fruit plate, the pastry of the day, and fantastically strong and flavorful coffee.  Omelets and fritattas are made with local produce and eggs.  Irish oatmeal is served with milk from a nearby creamery.  Toast bread changes daily but is always whole-grain and delicious.  Breakfast meats are lean and filling.  

Afternoons, iced tea and cookies are set out, and in the evenings wine and cheese served.  Enjoy them in a rocker on the front porch, relaxing on the back deck retreat, or in the privacy of your room.  

Staff is not only eminently professional, but warm and gracious.  Heidi at the front desk was beyond helpful in making suggestions for what to do in the city or where to eat (I will be forever indebted to her for recommending what was probably our best meal of the trip at Soba).  If you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh, lodgings can't get much better than the Inn on Negley.

That's probably sufficient gushing."}
{"text":"I went to the Inn on Negley with a couple girlfriends at 2:00 pm on a Sunday.  The food and tea were tasty, and we all really enjoyed the ambiance of the inn - the tea room was cute, calming and perfect for us to catch up over some tea and small bites.  My only recommendation would be that they offer more savory items and less desserts.  By the end, there were so many sweet items that it was difficult to finish them all (and we actually ended up taking some home instead), and we wished there were more sandwiches/savory bites to counteract the sweetness.  Make sure you make reservations, because they are required for high tea."}
{"text":"This place is adorable and quaint. It's a former house turned into a bed and breakfast plus a restaurant. I had brunch here. The staff was clearly very well trained and put a lot of effort into the details, while retaining it's cozy, intimate, homey feel. The food was also quality."}
{"text":"I went here because my sister had High Tea at Noon on her wedding day. It was such a cool experience! I loved it. I felt like a dainty person. Kind of. It was like we were in a different time in a different world. I love the decor. The food was scrumptious. And of course, the tea was wonderful! I'd love to go back to The Inn on Negley!"}
{"text":"We came here just for the high tea. It was reasonably priced and everything was delicious! The mint chocolate tea was out of this world. We will definitely be back. The only thing that I think could have been better was the service. They could have been a little bit more attentive for refills of hot water or anything else we may have needed throughout the seating."}
{"text":"Beautiful decoration & wide range of tea selection. costly though."}
{"text":"This gorgeous little B&B was our May stop on the ladies brunch tour of the burgh. I made reservations ahead of time so that there was not an issue. Glad I did as they had a large party coming in as we were leaving. Tip: Enter through the back doors.

The brunch is (for the most part) all inclusive for sbout $25. )We were offered beverages-coffee, tea, juices. We were then brought a fruit cup and a small plate of muffins/bread. The morning glory bread was full of good for you stuff and resembled a zuchini bread. The banana choc chip mini muffins were so yummy! We were then read the menu of the day which consisted of a french toast topped with berries and granola or an egg dish with veggies. We were also informed that we could request eggs any way we liked them with toast and breakfast meat. I went with the French toast and a side of bacon. The main course took a little longer than expected but, we enjoyed our conversation and sipped on coffee that was never left empty. When the French toast arrived, it was well worth the wait. Cooked perfectly and topped with yummy berries and granola. Yum, yum. After we were finished with our main course we were given a small lemon bar for dessert. The tartness of the lemon was a great way to finish our meal. Overall, it was a delicious experience in a beautiful place! Take mom, she'll love it!"}
{"text":"I often look for a place to have afternoon tea when I travel and this is one of my favorite spots I've stumbled across. The Inn itself is lovely and was decorated for Halloween when I visited. The tea room was quiet and refined. Me and a friend and only one other couple were there on the day I visited. The tea selection was excellent and the menu seasonally appropriate and delicious. The sous chef brought out the trays himself and explained everything on the plates along with their ingredients. You can also try as many different teas as you like throughout the time you're there. I tried the Pomegranate Oolong as well as a seasonal Pumpkin tea. Both were delicious and served perfectly. I recommend for those looking for a great afternoon tea in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"FIVE STARS!!!! Let me start with the amazing duo of Cindy (coordinator) and Liz (owner) who both made this luncheon/tea an occasion to remember. I wanted a Downton Abbey type of tea party, minus the crazy hats and Yorkshire accents. ;-) But, I live in another state, so I arranged this event by phone, and unfortunately did so at the last minute (not recommended) and these women were so understanding and gracious and pleasant and FUN, my family was BEYOND happy. ::: The ambiance/tea room was outstanding. No detail unconsidered. Including the amazing tea. ::: Now, I can't forget to review the food which was not only exceptional, but perfectly plated. Finger sandwiches, scones, mini patisseries, all brought out to enjoy at your leisure. We loved those scones so much, with the creme fresh and homemade jam, Chef Albert gave each of us scone recipes and talked us through ingredient substitutions if needed. ::: Bottom line is, If you live in Pittsburgh and overlook this gem, you're foolish. Take one afternoon, say no to the over-portioned, homogeneous chain restaurants, like Olive Garden and Cheesecake Factory, and go to the Inn to create a real Pittsburgh memory."}
{"text":"-Beautiful interior and Deck
-Courteous Staff
-Delicious leisurely brunch
* Greatly appreciated that the chef came outside to greet us and describe their brunch service.
-Affordable afternoon tea service"}
{"text":"I've never had the pleasure of staying here but this is where my boyfriends mom stays when she is in town. They've been very nice to accommodate my boyfriend and I even though we are not staying so I've had a few breakfasts here. They food is always delicious- usually a sweet or savory option plus a classic eggs, toast, meat, bread. The French toast is delicious. The bacon is so yummy crispy delicious. Coffee here is really good! 

They have a beautiful back patio and a station with coffee and tea out all the time. So I've spent a few afternoons enjoying that. All the staff has been very gracious to us."}
{"text":"After I got engaged, my mom asked me what kind of bridal shower I wanted. I told her I want a formal tea party.

Most of my family lives in Pittsburgh, so they took it upon themselves to plan the tea party. They chose The Inn on Negley for afternoon tea.

It was everything I wanted and more!

We had a side room with a round table that sat the 8 of us. It was very private. When the food came out I was amazed! There were little cucumber sandwiches, chicken salad sandwiches, crostinis, 2 types of scones, cheesecake, strawberry shortcake, and little bundt cakes. There were enough for 1 piece for everyone. The food was so delicious and filling! I usually don't like scones and think they're too dry, but these ones were perfect!

Everyone gets 2 different kettles of tea. Each kettle is about 3 glasses. For the first kettle, I had Wedding Tea (naturally) It was delicious! The second tea I had a vanilla cream. This was great too! I think everyone enjoyed all of their tea. My mom got a chocolate mint that she said tasted like Andie's Candies.

I thought the building and some of the rooms were so beautiful! My family loved the tea and whole experience. We decided to make it a tradition to come here every few years.

I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I met a friend for high tea on a weekday so we were the only ones there which we didn't mind at all given that we both brought our two year old children. We were served by Chef Jackie who I found to be friendly and informative. I was very impressed with the large selection of tea that included both loose and bagged options. We were told we could try as many as we wanted. 

I must admit I was a little disappointed with the quantity of sandwiches given. We were served an egg salad sandwich, a ham with avocado, and a take on a BLT which was bacon, tomato, and julienned spinach on top served on a piece of French bread. I wanted more. The second plate had fresh fruit and two scones- citrus and vanilla cream. Both were delicious but small in size. The final plate had a brownie, sponge cake, and small cupcake. Everything was delicious but I would have rather have had another sandwich or two over the last plate and larger scones. All of this cost $21pp."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh has a Four Seasons!

From Paris to Shanghai, London to Bangkok, the care with which this little B&B operation is run in Pittsburgh exceeds the best that I have experienced in any of these cities.

It may not have the conference facilities of a larger hotel, the business center, or in-house spa, but as a B&B, this is about as good as it gets. 

The structure in which the whole thing is held (do we call it a 'house'?) is old (perhaps we could say it generically to be 'victorian') with decor to match. These are far from our tastes, but they compensate (in our eyes) by taking good care of what they have. The TVs aren't even old flat screens, but they do stock the rooms thoroughly with l'occitane.

Where this place really shines is in the staff and the food. I actually find this aspect to be _better_ or even _much_ better than many celebrated big-city five-star properties. When was the last time that the night staff pulled some food from the refrigerator (gratis) after a midnight arrival caused by flight delays?

They make everything in-house and it is all extraordinary. On this last visit, I indulged in their traditional french toast with a side of eggs. I forgot that this all includes an additional course in advance with fruit (not just big grocery store chucks of melon) and house-made cookies and muffins. On each visit, they mix these up. For this December visit, they did gingerbread cookies (of course). The Chef (Jackie), from NYC, could be gainfully employed high up the hierarchy of any top big-city restaurant.

There is no elevator, so either pack light if you want a room on the 3rd floor or choose a 1st or 2nd floor room. The 1st floor room has double doors so I didn't find it any noisier than the others. You are in a city and on a reasonably busy street, so don't expect the charming home to be continued into a surrounding yard (although they do have an attractive new deck out back)."}
{"text":"What a wonderful location!  My sister's future MIL hosted her bridal shower here and with 11 people, we had our own private room.  It was tastefully decorated and beautiful.  The Inn on Negley also has a private parking lot in the back meant for their guests but street parking is plentiful around there, as well.

The tea room is simply gorgeous and the variety of tea is plentiful and delicious!  They even had a blue & yellow tea for us (the bride's wedding colors) and I loved the fact that we could request a different type of tea the second time around.  The food was delicious from the cucumber finger sandwiches to the apricot scones.

What a lovely spot for afternoon tea and I look forward to returning again to Pittsburgh - may want to stay there next time!"}
{"text":"Amazing!

I recently hosted my friend's bridal shower here and everything was absolutely perfect!  Heidi went above and beyond helping me plan from 3 hours away, including taking pictures of the tea room and promptly responding to my many many emails. The Inn itself is gorgeous, and the staff was extremely professional and accommodating. 

A++++!!!"}
{"text":"I had afternoon tea here and I find the scones unique because of the fruit used in scones. Service was good as well and a fair selection of teas. I would def be back when I'm in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"My partner and I had a fantastic experience here one afternoon. We'd reserved a table for High Tea. The service was excellent. We got to try a few different types of tea. The chef came out with sandwiches, scones and pastries. These were lovely too. The staff qas courteous enough to enquire about dietary restrictions while we made our reservation. It's a bit expensive (35$ for one person), but worth it for a special occasion or with a special someone."}
{"text":"My best friend and I try to do afternoon tea once a year during the winter months and this was our second time visiting The Inn on Negley. The first time we visited the staff that greeted us at the door wasn't all that friendly. They pretty much judged us from the get go as if we were too young to be having a nice afternoon tea. So after that we decided to give it another try and hope it would be better. Thankfully the staff was much nicer this year!

I've never had afternoon tea elsewhere to compare this experience to but I personally love it. They have a really nice selection of teas to choose from. Each table gets an assortment of scones, desserts, and appetizers/tea sandwiches. These selections change every day based on what the chef decides to make that day. Both times I thought the selection was fantastic."}
{"text":"We went for Afternoon Tea.  I made a short list of three goals to accomplish while stuck in the lower 48 states: Afternoon Tea, attend a city council meeting, and meet my friend's baby.  That's how important tea is to me.  I've put on my own five course formal teas, supped on the three-tier tower in Iceland, and gathered & dried my own wild herbs for teasanes.  So I'm a tough critic.  I will allow that.

Tea at the Inn on Negley was lovely and would probably wow the pants off anyone else.  There were five ladies celebrating an upcoming wedding and they looked happy.  They were super dressed up which made me feel dressed down even though I was dressed up, but hey, I get cut some slack because all I was celebrating was the fact that I was on my way to get an MRI.  Which I have to say...I was super relaxed thanks to tea.  I was worried I'd eat to much, but the Inn's tea is not as over the top, stuff-your-gut, explode your blood sugar as some I've had.  

The best dish was the little caprese sandwich on the top layer.  It had excellent flavor.  My other half survives through tea with me because he doesn't like mayo and has a lower sugar tolerance than I do.  He did ok with this tea.

There were two scones per person.  We couldn't remember what the chef said they were but one rocked and one was average.  Not sure how that happened, but maybe one was fresher?  We liked the little pieces of fresh fruit on the scone plate: sliced kiwi for me and oranges for him.

I thoroughly enjoyed my pot of Oolong tea.  This will make me sound trite, but half my brain chose it because it sounded like the most expensive tea on the menu (and you can pick anything you want).  Our waiter had told us we could change teas if we wanted at any point, but I didn't.  My oolong was very good.  I had it refilled.  In contrast, my husband was disappointed that the first tea he chose came in a tea bag.  Gasp!  A tea bag at afternoon tea!  And it was Stash no less!  I remembered the menu said something about using both loose and bagged, but it wasn't marked anywhere which was which.  Whoops.  We were both bummed by his tea.  And I felt guilty because I'd picked it for him because he'd liked black vanilla tea at another formal tea.  We strategized while we ate and I suggested he ask the waiter which teas on the menu were loose leaf and which were not but instead he ordered a grapefruit white tea off the seasonal menu.  This was also a bagged tea but at least it was Harney & Sons.  So, dear readers, if you want loose tea ASK.

I purposely took forever eating the tiny food and enjoyed myself, however the BEST part of tea was what came after.  The waiter had told us we were welcome to explore the Inn and we took that to its fullest logical conclusion and poked around every nook and cranny in that place that wasn't locked.  In addition to being a tea nerd, I am a B&B nerd so this was an excellent opportunity to do RESEARCH.  We started with peering at the art in the dining room and reading about the artists.  Next was the other eating room where they have happy hour for overnight guests.  And then a living room.  All of the rooms are tasteful and classic with gorgeous, stately antiques.  We really liked the pigeon hole desks.  Upstairs we visited a bedroom with two twins; downstairs an ADA accessible room with a big ol' four poster bed.  I salivated over the breakfast menu.  Downstairs they also have a little gift shop and a powerd room for tea guests.  They have miniature L'Occitane of Provence toiletries in the rooms and while I have seen their stores everywhere, I had never before touched their product.  They have a big pump of L'Occitane soap in said powder room and it was a game changer for me: it was the first soap I have ever liked (I hate soap).  The bathrobes and slippers are so luxurious you'd actually want to steal them and sleep in them for the rest of your life.

Besides axing the tea bags, the only thing that would have made me happier about tea is if they had included an Inn post card.  They charge 50 cents for them and I was too cheap to buy one for my scrapbook."}
{"text":"I went here again for Mother's Day with my mom and sister last Saturday. We got there a bit early but they let us in the dining room because there was this crazy baby shower going on it the rest of the inn and we had no where to even stand. The staff was very nice even though we were 15 mins early they got our tea and stuff for us earlier than are appointment time which they didn't have to do but it was very nice. All of our food came out very fast and once again the food was great and we all had a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely afternoon tea experience with friends at the Inn! It's cozy and intimate, adorned with Victorian style paintings, trinkets, and furniture. The atmosphere doesn't mandate dressing up, but you can if you'd really like to get into it. I think in these kinds of environments you'd typically like to anyway to fit the mood. $30 for the experience, 3 savory options, 2 scones, and 3 desserts.

(+) Make a reservation especially for large groups
(+) Tea selection: They offer a variety of teas: black, green, fruity, white, oolong, etc. My friends loved the Vanilla Creme Black Tea (thick, milky, tasty). I had the Pomegranate Oolong Tea and the Vanilla Creme Grapefruit White Tea. The latter is very sweet! Unlimited tea for the entirety of your time
(+) Savory options: hummus + burschetta, chicken salad sandwich, cucumber finger sandwich (in order by favorites); very accommodating for our vegetarian friend
(+) Scones: the vanilla scone is the best with jam + creme fraiche
(+) Service: the servers were so patient and helpful, offering to hang our coats and explain everything to us
(-) Desserts: lemon macaron, cinnamon apple tart, chocolate ganache brownie (in order by favorites); not terrible though"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved our stay at the Inn on Negley!! There is so much to review and not enough space to do it. We stayed in the Cortland suite which was so comfortable and quiet. It was a room off by itself which I was unaware of at the time of booking. That made it so much better. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom was spacious and the decor was spectacular. The only part I didn't quite like was the street noise early in the morning. The breakfast was insanely good with so many choices other than the typical continental. There were eggs, belgian waffles, pancakes, etc to choose from. Each morning breakfast began with a cup of fresh cut up fruit and a freshly baked pastry. The service was perfect with the proper amount of attention without being too invasive. The staff was one of the most polite and courteous I've ever encountered. Thank you so much for making our stay perfect. I hope to visit again some day."}
{"text":"Although a bit pricey, I've come here for Valentine's Day tea with some girlfriends (yay for Galentine's Day) two years in a row and have had stellar experiences both times. What really prompted me to come back the second time was how accommodating they were for guests with food restrictions. When making our reservations, I let them know that I was a vegetarian and they brought out a separate savory course with 3 different types of sandwiches, on par with the \"regular\" sandwich options. The food is divided into 3 \"courses\": one savory course of mini sandwiches and two sweet courses: the first one with scones and biscuits and the second one with deserts (tarts, macaroons, cheesecake, etc.) As far as the teas go, there is a wide selection and you can't really go wrong with any of the options. Some personal favorites include the Jasmine tea and Mango white tea! 

Additionally, everything is presented in a very classy manner and the overall Victorian decor is very intimate and classy as well."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped here for high tea as a pre holiday treat. The Inn is completely decorated for Christmas both inside and out. We were even allowed to tour a vacant guest room. It felt so warm and cozy inside. I was very impressed by the way the room and bathroom had been modernized yet had a homey feel to it.

The room where we were led also had a \"Dicken's Village display set up. It's not often I see one of those. So our very friendly waiter came over and explained the teas. I learned that the ones on the holiday menu are bagged teas. Their regular menu is all loose leaf. We were told we each could have a pot of our choice which was completely refillable. If we weren't happy with our choice then they would replace it with another one.

My first one was a chocolatey mint one which was one of their Christmas blends but I didn't care for it. I settled instead for a loose leaf pomegranate. My girlfriend was happy with hers. 

The place setting was set up with everything you need for tea and shortly the chef brought out our 3 small courses on a three tiered platter. The top platter had some tea party sandwiches. The second had orange flavored scones. The bottom had desserts once of which was pumpkin pie with pumpkin seeds on it.

On the table were jelly and cream for our scones. I didn't think that we would be full after seeing so little but indeed everything we ate was very good and extremely filling! We got our tea pots replenished several times and just basked be inside a cozy environment with it being so cold outside.

Street parking is available although it is permit for up to two hours so you can park during the day for that amount of time only for free. This is a perfect place to take someone for a special occasion. They also serve brunch here as well. You must call however, for reservations."}
{"text":"Had a lovely Saturday afternoon high tea date with my daughter. When we travel to the U.K. and Ireland, etc we love having afternoon tea. The Inn certainly lived up to our high expectations.
Yet another little Pittsburgh gem not to be taken for granted.
The tea selection is immense but not overwhelming. The tea sandwiches, scones and desserts are simply delicious. Refined, refreshing and elegant without being pretentious.
Beautiful Victorian home with rooms decorated to reflect the authenticity of a time gone by.
The guest rooms are spacious, very pretty and immaculate.
Teddy Bears adorn the rooms and hallways without being overdone.
Truly a must-see, must-do experience.
Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely adorable!  On my quest to be a refined English lady I've been on a hunt for the cities best high tea service.  Probably not the most popular past time, but you can't knock it until you've tried it!  And... You MUST try this place!

This is a proper setting for such an event, you almost feel like you need white gloves and a parasol!  And surprise, the Inn is actually an Inn!  Apparently it dates back to the olden days of yore (late 1800's) and is one of those old Shadyside mansions that was converted into an Inn at some point.  But if you have relatives who want something more unique in the heart of a vibrant Burgh neighborhood, I'd suggest here!

Let's get to the tea service though!  It's served from noon to four daily, which is nice for a \"ladies who lunch afternoon\" or a Saturday or Sunday outing for mom.  It's in a parlor, which is small but charming.  There's also an outdoor patio that would be nice if it's not too hot out (drinking hot tea in 80 degrees isn't too appealing).  There's a full High Tea Service for $20 per person, which seems a little steep, but for tea service isn't too bad.  There's also other combo's for around $12, but I'd say go big or go home!

The tea menu is VERY large and there were tons of choices. They give you the main choices between black, green and herbal, but you can also blend them together too.  I chose the caramel vanilla, which I guess is being taken off the menu sadly.  It was delish though... so maybe they'll bring it back at some point.  There were honestly a lot of different ones I would have been more than happy with too!

The one thing I think is very cool and very different is that they offer you a different tea selections with the different tiers of food.  I've never heard of them doing that before.  Usually you get one tea choice and that's it.  I love that you can pair the foods together with different teas for no up-charge.  Very unique and a definite perk of coming here.  

I've been to several High Tea Services and this one would definitely be on the light side.  The portions were small, but surprisingly filled me up for the entire afternoon until a later dinner.  I mean, it's tea service, not a five course meal!  There was a chicken and egg salad sandwich and a mushroom and cream cheese on a crisp baguette.  The winner was absolutely the mushroom and cream cheese choice.  It was amazing and I definitely could have eaten ten of those!  

There were two scone choices of blueberry/peach and lemon/lemon ginger.  Those were actually surprisingly tiny.  I thought they were both moist and fresh, but I would have loved them to be a bit bigger because they were so good and I love to slather clotted cream on them!   Oh, and there was also fresh fruit.  Which is great and all, but more scone please!

The last tier was the desserts.  Forgive me for not being accurate enough, but there was a delicious chocolate piece, cheesecake with lemon curd and blueberries.  Loved the chocolate, but I like my cheesecake plain.  While it was good it wasn't life changing.  BUT, the coconut macaroon was honestly thee best macaroon I had EVER had.  Again, ten of those in my possession would have been scarfed down in like 5 seconds.  I would buy a batch of those if I could!  Seriously, can I??

I can't wait to bring my mom here, total mom place fo sho!  But I also love it for myself too!  Or for a bridal shower... If I could do another one (since I'm married I don't think that's proper).  But it's a great place, that's what I'm trying to say and I'll for sure be back to get my proper English lady on!"}
{"text":"The Inn on Negley offers high tea by reservation daily between 12 PM and 4 PM.  A close friend loves tea so we booked a sitting for her birthday.  We were seated in the front room with the fireplace - the other room as taken by a larger group of people (we only had 3 people) and it was lovely to be in that room with a fireplace on such a cold and snowy day.  The Inn is a renovated Victorian House from the 1800s that has been lovingly restored to maintain the original moldings, skirting, and decorative plasterwork.  The furniture is an eclectic mix of Victorian- and Classic-styles that work nicely together to create a beautiful yet relaxed atmosphere for high tea.  I suspect that one could dress for high tea or more casually as we did (mostly because of the weather) because the Inn is more quaint than pretentious, which made for a comfortable time spent with friends.

Once we settled in at our table, our server took our tea orders - you are allowed 2 pots of tea per person and can choose 2 different teas or 2 of the same - they had approximately 30 options of tea from which to choose. Shortly after our first pots of tea arrived, the chef brought out a 3-tiered serving platter that had the finger foods to pair with our tea selections.  The top tray were the finger sandwiches (1 of each per person) which were a chicken salad finger sandwich, an egg salad finger sandwich, and a crostini with cream cheese and cucumber.  The second tier had 2 different flavors of buttery, delicious scones - a cinnamon scone which I paired with the creme fraiche that was on the table, and a dried-fruit and almond scone that paired nicely with the preserves on the table.  The bottom plate was the dessert tier which had a raspberry-filled sandwich cookie, a mini chocolate cupcake, and a rosewater French macaron all of which were heavenly particularly the macaron, which was sweet and fragrant from the rosewater.  Even though it might not sound like a lot of food, I was full by the time I finished my last bite of food and sip of tea - it was just the perfect amount of food for a light lunch.  I had lemon-ginger tea for my first selection and the Valentine's Day tea (chocolate with roses) for my second.  The lemon ginger was nice, but lacked the tartness from the lemon and the zing from the ginger that I've experienced with other lemon-ginger teas, but it was a pleasant tea to drink.  The Valentine's Day tea was delicious and I added a small bit of milk and turbinado sugar to that and it tasted heavenly and paired well with the dessert portion of our tea treats.  The cost is a bit steep at $25/person plus tax, but overall it was well worth it for the whole package, so please don't let the price deter you from going here because it is worth the price to experience a real high tea in such a lovely setting.  I will definitely be back and would highly recommend going to the Inn on Negley for high tea if you are looking for a unique and delicious experience that you cannot find everywhere."}
