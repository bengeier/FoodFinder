{"text":"The piece of haddock I got was paper thin and the portion was about half of what you would get at New Toronto Fish and Chips. I would definitely drive the extra 5 minutes next time. On a positive note the Chips were tasty."}
{"text":"Best fish n chips I've had in T.O., and I've been around. The service is great, everyone is really friendly. Also a family-run business, so the place feels really homey. However, I usually prefer getting take-out as the dining area is pretty small. The menu is pretty limited, but has everything you'd need. The food is also a little pricier than other F&C places, but as the food is amazing it's worth it."}
{"text":"I had been craving fish & chips all day so I popped in here for take-out on my way home. The place isn't much to look at, but the tables were full and there was a line-up for take-out so I figured I had found a gem and didn't mind waiting.   So wrong! The chips were mediocre and the halibut was overcooked and chewy. The coleslaw clearly came from a bucket and the tartar sauce was in packets! What kind of fish & chip shop doesn't make their own tartar sauce??  I won't be back."}
{"text":"ordered the haddock & chips & onion rings - the batter was crispy for the onion rings but OMG it was so greasy that I couldn't even finish it.   Fish - the batter was crispy but the fish was so thin that you can barely see it or taste it.  The chips was good colour & fully cooked but not crispy.  the only good thing was the chips. will never go back, was the worst lunch I ever had, waste of my hard earned money"}
{"text":"It's not bad. But I think that the portion size of the fish is a bit small.  And they should have a better combo menu, than just fish, chips, coleslaw and a piece of bread...."}
{"text":"Super crispy battered halibut and wonderful crispy flavorful fries.  Great service in a comfortable setting.  Give them a go."}
{"text":"Definitely needs a renovation, had a weird smell to the whole place. The bread that came with the meal was literally two pieces of Wonderbread.  Service was OK, I believe this is a family run business.  The food otherwise was good though, standard fish & chips and that's a good thing. May come back but only for take out."}
{"text":"My favourite fish and chips place in Etobicoke!  From the dated 70's decor - including murky fish tank built into the counter and framed and signed Captain Highliner photo on the wall - this place is a living time capsule!   But I come for the food and IMO the have the best Halibut and chips in the area.  Kingsway Fish and chips is a close second, and has a much nicer interior, but for a workday lunch - this is my pick!"}
{"text":"The best fish n' chips resturant in Toronto.  The service is great and the staff makes you feel welcome.  The place needs to be upgraded in their furniture."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Fish tasted  bland and dry. Fries tasted like frozen type. Coleslaw was mediocre. The bread was the saddest part. Two steamed slices of wonder bread. It looked like there was no effort or enthusiasm put into the meals. What would it take to offer a fresh baked rolls. The decor was outdated. But I wasn't there to eat the decor.  I've been to plenty mum and pop shops that looked sketchy but the food and service were great.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Queensway Fish and Chips must be doing something right, they've been around for like 40 years! It seems like they've got a loyal following of local customers. When it comes to serving fish and chips, it's very old school. But in this case, old school is cool!  Enjoy the batter on the halibut and haddock, it always has the right crispness to it. I don't know what it is about the packets of tartar sauce they have but it seems to be better than anything I find at the grocery.  This place is my standard for fish and chips in the city."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of these old school fish and chips shops. Nothing fancy and they have all the trappings from yesteryear, right down to the cheesy little yellow and white receipt book with the handwritten scribbles on it. The big plastic swordfish on the wall and the deep fryers out in open view with decades of patina worn as a badge of honour. The menu is clearly displayed along the top of the kitchen area, with halibut and chips as the highlight etched in the brown plastic. 'Please be seated' she says as I pick my drink from the varieties of pop cans in the cooler. 'I'll have a root beer please' as I turn to sit at the chrome edged tables overlooking the full front picture window high up in the strip mall overlooking the parking lot and the Queensway on a busy and gorgeous Friday evening. The service was perfect, as were the fish and chips along with cole slaw, 'do you have any lemon?' already knowing the answer because you always have to ask in these shops. 'O yes' she says, bringing one glorious slice on a plate. Perfection, I tell you."}
{"text":"Great fish and chips.  Family business.  Richard is there every day with a smile.   Get the halibut!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips. The staff are friendly and the service is fast. I really enjoy their shrimp and coleslaw. I would recommend this place to anyone because it is clean and respectable and they know what they are doing. you can get a small or large order. Have been going here for years now. So if you want great fish and chips this is the place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been here for as long as I can remember. They have delicious food and it's a classic fish and chips place. The service is great, whoever is working always welcomes customers and will converse with you if it isn't too busy. The restaurant is old but it gives that nice nonstalgic, memory lane, back in the day, good feeling. Whenever I crave for fish and chips, I just come here."}
{"text":"Does anyone have the batter recipe they use or a similar one? I know as a fact it's not a beer batter. Please help me out with this. I live in California and the fish & chips are terrible here!!"}
{"text":"I would not return to this place. The establishment seems dirty when you walk in and there are bugs.  The fish was overcooked and almost inedible with a side of tasteless fries."}
{"text":"First I want to state Queensway Fish and Chips provides quality food and services. Having been in the neighbourhood for 40 years they have an excellent reputation for great food and always maintain good standards. I ordered food from skip the dishes and watched on the app as the driver left the shop in less than 20 min this at 515pm the driver contacted me to say he was at my condo I gave him the unit number and entry code. he said he couldn't park. I gave  instructions. the driver continued to call me for over a 1 hour period asking for unit numbers how to park. at times he was in my lobby sometimes I could see he was driving about a mile away. I contacted Skip the dishes 3 times. once they said to go meet him in the lobby app showed his car 6 blocks from my home. The delivery arrived at 640pm. driver was unapologetic Skip the dishes promised a refund 3 days later Queensway called they were upset as Skip the dishes said I complained about the quality of the food and they were not paying Queensway and lowering their rating.  I did not complain about the food the driver was incompetent. The food was actually still ok but cold due to the drivers incompatice. I have not received a refund and do not think Queensway should pay! I will not use Skip The dishes again."}
