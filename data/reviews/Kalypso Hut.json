{"text":"A decent place with good, cheap food. Not a fancy restaurant if you're trying to impress a date, as it is probably due for renovations or a makeover, but if you're looking for an inexpensive meal and large portions this is the place for you.   Come hungry, or if you are a light eater you will definitely want to split your meal with a friend or even 2 friends! No I am not exaggerating.. the portions are HUGE! The waitress was also very nice and was accommodating for our large group.  Loud West Indian music plays in the background which is to be expected from such a place that also features live music and karaoke, so be prepared to talk a little louder than you normally would, but overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I've only had the lunch buffet but it's pretty good. You just walk in, fill up a dish and either take it to go or eat there. Buffet is pretty basic but good serving fried chicken, sweat and sour chicken, battered fish, rice, lo mein, bok choy veggie mix. If you're not a salt lover you most likely won't like this place."}
{"text":"For $8 the all u can eat take out lunch is hard to beat in terms of bang for your buck.  The fried fish is the best thing offered.    My usual includes the fried fish, fried rice, noodles, veggies,and the roast chicken.  The food is fresh and hot.  They went cheap and don't offer their pepper sauce when you take out anymore.  The only other thing I don't like about the place is the guy that works there looking over at you when getting the food. Hey, it's a all u can eat place;  leave me alone!"}
{"text":"First off, $6.99 lunch buffet is amazing. The selection of food isn't the greatest but the food is good. The staff are friendly and decently attentive but you might need to waive them down from time to time. Their hot sauce has a great kick to it so if you like spice you should try it.   I was able to talk with the owner and he told be that their take out and catering business has been increasing significantly. Haven't tried their catered food, but I might need to for my next event."}
{"text":"Keep in mind, when you go to smaller lunch buffets like the one in Kalypso Hut, you get what you pay for.   Im not saying its bad. Oh its not at all. I actually really enjoyed their food that Ive been back 4 times since I found the place last Monday. Its good for when you want just something cheap to fill you up to the brim.  There isnt a lot of options. They have the regulars: salad, fried rice, noodles, vegetables, fried fish fillets. And they have chicken entrees, that as far as I know varies. 3 out of the 4 times Ive been, there was (what I think they were) roasted chicken, bbq chicken, and something like sweet and sour chicken. Last time I went, this past Thursday, they had fried (non breaded and sauce on the side) lemon chicken, and curry chicken. Those two were probably the best ones Ive had so far. And the fish fillets are so delicious! The breading tastes like KFC! The noodles are a bit bland. So is the rice.  For less than $10, with a can of pop included, its a pretty good option for lunch!"}
{"text":"If you like west indian food this is the place. Low prices, and a cheap $6.99 lunch buffet.  My favourites are the beef fried rice, beef lowmein, and pepper shrimp.  Try the wings there extremely good, especially with lemon squeezed on it.  Try the \"chicken in the rough\", which is basically fried chicken thats not breaded but has the best tasting crispy skin.   This is definitely a takeout place, i dunno who designed the place but i think they went to a garage sale first. Also they have different chefs so depending on whos cooking theres a difference in taste, which kinda sucks"}
{"text":"Honestly what more could you ask for from a $6.99 lunch buffet. Fresh fried fish that has an awesome seasoning and crunch. Roast chicken that is nice and tender. Noodles and rice are basic Caribbean Chinese style. Mixed veg has carrots, cabbage, and bok choy. Salad is your standard iceberg lettuce w red pepper and a few other veg. Decor is spartan. Reggae plays on the house stereo."}
