{"text":"I stopped in after visiting the Doctor next door.  Wow!  This place is fantastic!  I was a fan of Subway but Togos is my new number 1.  Great food, wonderful and helpful employees and the place was so clean you can eat off the floors!  Forget about the other sandwhich shops in town. This place has the best food, good prices and delivers a great value!"}
{"text":"Just opened, so the crew has a learning curve- but I'm glad the classic California Togo's has moved to a free state!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time the other day with my 3 kids. The menu is very inviting and a gal that worked there was very friendly. I can't say the same for the owner/manager. He came out and took my money for the order. A little pricey for not many options of sandwich toppings. However I was hungry and ready to try something new.   I enjoyed my sandwich and so did my boys. My daughter however wasn't that hungry but the house salad was pretty big. I told the lady no tomatoes and onion and so se got lettuce and croutons. Not her fault she is just doing her job. I would eat there again but probably order the special."}
{"text":"I have been a Togos customer for years (Bay Area Ca) and was so happy to see them reappear in AZ after closing their previous locations a few years back. I love the #9 and love that they have Pepsi, price is a bit high in the sandwich market but they do give you a good amount of meat.. also like the chocolate brownie. I wish they had curbside, or a call ahead pick up window or a drive through."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying this place and I must say the service was above and beyond. I called in a pick up order and Britney happily took my order and ensured I had what I needed. She worked along side another gentlemen that was very welcoming. Great sandwich, great customer service, great overall first experience."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place until yesterday. Decided to try them out. Ordered the Italian and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I thought that maybe the Zesty Italian Vinaigrette was bit too zesty at first but it quickly envelopes your taste buds."}
{"text":"This rating is for the quality of service I received tonight.  The staff at this location need training! ! They are normally slow, but tonight was absurd.  There was only 1 other customer in there and it took 20 minutes for 2 people to make 2 sandwiches. It appeared they didn't know where to find pastrami or bacon, or how to heat the pastrami correctly since the kid was saying \"ouch ouch ouch\" and burning himself with it. It was over-nuked to the point it was inedible rubber.   Had to repeat 3 times \"no onions\".  Had to instruct the worker that the \"boom boom\" sauce goes on the boom boom pastrami, as advertised on the giant sign in the store.   Had to remind him that he forgot the cheese.   Had to remind him to toast the sandwich. (BTW - he toasted it with lettuce and tomato already on. ...soggy veggies anyone?)  Very sad that management left 2 untrained workers there.  It gives Togo's a bad name."}
{"text":"I was suffering from Togo's withdrawal from the time the previous franchisee gave it up, back in 2008 or so.  So I was thrilled when a new franchisee opened this location.  Service is great, very friendly and efficient.  The sandwiches are exactly as I remembered, tasty and generous.  The owner is very energetic and very appreciative of regular customers.  Hope it's here to stay."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a \"great sandwich\" I would not recommend Togos. It is the equivalent, in my opinion, to a subway. The bread does not taste fresh and the vegetables looked a little old when I went."}
{"text":"I have been to Togos 3 times now and I have to say it is very hit and miss. I am extremely bothered by the fact that each time I have been here, it is obvious that I am a novice, yet nobody will offer any information or  suggestions about the food. Once I ask questions, they are a plethora of information but otherwise they all just seem to stare at you until you ask  something. Case in point, the cheese. If they don't automatically put cheese on  there, why not ASK if you want cheese, so you at least know it isn't going to be there when you get your sandwich home? Then there's the bread..I LURVE sourdough but overheard the people next to me say that you have to toast the bread otherwise it is impossible to eat. So then it is my turn to order, and I ask for it toasted because I heard it was easier to eat that way, and the guy working goes \"OOOH Yeah it definitely is\" and I'm thinking it was a good thing I overheard the other customers, cause the guy making the sandwich sure as heck wasn't going to warn me, even though he emphatically agreed. (By the way, toasted or not, this bread is like tearing through beef jerky. All you can do is clamp your teeth in and fling your head to the side while you hope that not too big of a chunk rips off; meanwhile all the filling shoots out the back of the sandwich while you sit there like a caveman with leathery bread hanging out of your teeth.)  Perhaps the biggest annoyance with their lack of disclosure is the limited menu. Reading the above reviews, I couldn't help but think that it is not cute, or kitschy, or very good business practice, to only list 10 sandwiches on your menu when you have 40 more in your arsenal. That just pisses me off. The guy making the sandwich actually tells me to go home and look up the menu. Why? Why there is not a complete printed menu available just infuriates me.  Overall, I find the whole thing to be a bit pretentious. Sandwiches are good but overpriced, and the little \"Hidden Menu\" thing just makes me feel like there's some kind of inside joke going on and I'm not in on it.  Get the pastrami, don't get the sourdough, ask for cheese, and bring your patience because the people that work there will make you angry."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite and was so pleasantly surprised with the experience. Ordered the veggie wrap, which came hot, and was so flavorful! Friend had the pastrami and said it was one of the best sandwiches she'd had!!! Wow. Cheap and easy. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow, great food, great sandwiches, great salad wraps, friendly  staff,always smiling and making customers feel comfortable, I've Been to this location several times, this time I had the famous pastrami sandwich, it was fresh & meaty, fresh bread and produce, and I just discovered that they r having 5$ happy hour for the pastrami and Italian sandwich everyday after 4 pm. Great deal. Can't wait to come again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  Using my free birthday sub coupon.  I used to go to Togo's in California.  I ordered a pastrami sub.  Taking me back to the old days.  The sub was very tasteful and the bread was soft.  I will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love the hot pastrami  sandwiches, especially on Monday's when it's their sandwich of the day. Great prices and I really like the fact that they don't try and skimp on the meat. Their sandwich actually looks like the sandwich in their advertisements plus, it tastes great! I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I love Togos and nothing beats their #9 pastrami sandwich! But I have to admit that service hasn't been that great lately. The last three times I've visited Togo's have all been consecutively bad in their own way. The last two times I placed my order online, I arrived to pick it up and they just look at me dumbfounded and then say they didn't see the order. So it's completely pointless for me to preorder. The second to last time, I walked in and the store was empty but they were playing really loud uncensored hip hop music. Now I'm in my 20s so it's not like I'm appalled by the songs but it's just completely unprofessional. My last visit was last night and I'll take the blame for this one because I was unaware that they closed at 8pm and we showed up at 7:45. The chairs were already put on top of the tables and the employee saw my pull up and already had that look of dread on her face. I get it. But this is the only place where I can get the best pastrami sandwich. She was overall friendly, but sort of passive-aggressive. Right away I asked for two large pastrami sandwiches and she says we're closing in 10 minutes so it's going to be a long wait because we don't have anything hot. I said it's ok I don't mind the wait. She rolled her eyes and slammed through the kitchen door. As she was making the sandwiches she told me that I should've placed the order online so that they would have known that they would have to make pastrami. I explained that the last two times I did that, they forgot my order and she apologized for that. While I was waiting I noticed a sign that had the weight of what a pastrami sandwich should be. I wondered if those measurements were exact so when it came time for her to weigh the sandwich, I took a peak. It looks like we got shorted... by a lot! The sign said a large pastrami should weigh 6.8oz but ours were around 4.5oz. Like I said, I get that they were closing soon but if you're already doing the job, is it that hard to just do it right?"}
{"text":"The customer service here is great!  I came into the store for the first time for a late lunch, was greeted at the door by the employees and the manager.  The employees then proceeded to explain the menu to me and made recommendations based on my preferences.  I had the \"pick two\", half a Santa Fe salad and the pastrami sandwich, both very fresh and delicious!  I also found out about their catering option for events!  I would definitely come back again when I'm in the area! Too bad there are only two locations in Arizona!"}
{"text":"First time here and it's awesome. Great food for the price. The 9 inch is huge, so only get the 6 inch if it's just you. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"This place is on my way to go work since 2 years now, and I go very often to this place ! I always take the same think and I'm never disappointed, Asian Chicken Salad with extra Asian dressing. Little bit spicy but just enough :) I've been always served very nicely , I will definitely be back for my salad !"}
{"text":"Service sucks here 2 sandwiches and 1 salad  took 20 minutes to get made while 2 people are working the counter and 1 girl standing around talking and hiding in the back ... All she wanted to do was take the money ... No customer service what so ever !!!! 2 stars for the food"}
{"text":"Stop what you're doing and drive to this pleasant little suburb right this instant. The sandwich you will buy from this establishment will be worth it!  First of all, a brief history lesson is in order. (I say \"brief\" because I am too lazy to say \"extensive.\") In the 1990's there began the Great Togo's Debate. Though the chain of franchises had been around since the 1970's, an early-90's expansion had brought it to within walking distance of every surfer in California. And because Californians like to write their own rules of all things including the Queen's English, there emerged two camps of people: those who referred to Togo's as \"To Go's\" (as in \"take-out\"), and those who referred to Togo's as \"toe-go's\" (as in \"what those appendages at the top of your feet do when you walk\"). I kid you not, people came to blows over this Great Togo's Debate. Blood was shed, drinks were spilled, sandals were thrown...it was chaos.  Today I can say with full authority, and without flying sandals, that the correct pronunciation of this establishment is \"toe-go's.\" Let this henceforth be spread throughout the land!  Togo's did once have a small foothold in the East Valley. Rumors of a store in Tempe flourished, and I can confirm one did exist on Ray Rd in Chandler at one point. But they disappeared in time. And for the life of me, I cannot understand why. The sandwiches here are absolutely top-notch, and leave you wanting for nothing.  I caught wind that this Togo's was about to open, and showed up the day after it did so. The space inside is fairly cavernous. One television displayed sports, the other displayed the news with closed-captioning. Above that came the dull roar of Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" through the shop's speakers. There was good 90's music throughout my time there. It was loud enough to mask the sound of your chomping and drooling and cooing over your meal, but not loud enough to drown out the incessant gossipmongering of the teenage girls at the table next to you.   The music is part of the joy of being here. When I wore a younger man's mustache I frequented a Togo's that cranked up the radio on \"Disco Saturday Night.\" At one point they even had table dancing, although I cannot swear that was entirely condoned by the management.   Speaking of tables, no table at this joint seats more than four people. This is bad news if you're bringing the whole church choir (as I know you good little Yelpers tend to do) with you for Sunday Brunch. The tables can be moved together, but that sort of ruins the whole Feng Shui of the place, doesn't it?  You order your chow at a tall counter staffed by friendly folks. On all three of my visits, the staff has been excellent. They'll greet you at the door, walk you through the menu if you are uninitiated, and hold off from yelling \"Heretic!\" at you when you ask for a little extra this or that. In short, they understand that the customer has individual tastes and are not offended when you mess with their masterpiece.  And each sandwich really is a masterpiece. There is no skimping on meats or veggies. The bread is not made on-site but is trucked in from a specialty baker every morning. I know, I know, we've all been spoon-fed the Subway nonsense about how \"fresh baked is better\" for years and years, but I've never found that to be borne out in taste. Try this Togo's bread and tell me if you think it's better. I certainly do.  The listed menu is only a small portion of what they offer. In a fashion somewhat similar to In-n-Out Burger's \"Stealth Menu,\" there is more here than meets the eye. You order sandwiches by number, and there are officially around 30 sandwiches that can be ordered that way, even if only about seven of them are prominently displayed.   And here's how you can play the time-honored game of \"Spot the Exiled Californian.\" Did the lady next to you with the fake Coach purse just order a Number 27? Congratulations! She is a Californian-in-Exile! Did the man in the Hawaiian shirt in front of you call the clerk \"bro\" and ask for the Number Twelve? Yessiree, you've spotted yourself a genuine Californian-in-Exile! You see, there used to exist a paper menu that displayed every single available numbered sandwich. And folks who picked their favorite one have never forgotten.  And neither have I. For years I ordered the \"Hot 8\" (which coincidentally was my nickname in high school), and I would urge you to order the same. I absolutely believe you'll thank me for this at some point."}
{"text":"TOGO's is pretty good! I honestly really like the taste and flavor of the sandwiches; they fill you up too! I'm always adequately filled after eating a whole sandwich and the staff is really kind too. I always chat with the workers and they're super accommodating every time. I love the place!! It is right near my house and very convenient."}
{"text":"Great place - if you like a bread sandwich! Over-priced and under-filled sandwiches. It has the potential to be yummy - but it's hard to determine flavor when the sandwich has only 1 or 2 slices of meat & 1 slice of cheese. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich shop! So glad we finally got one in AZ. Been going to Togo's in CA for years...sandwiches are so much better than Subway or Quizno's. I've been coming to this location since the first week it opened and have made a point to go at least once a week...that's how good it is. I drive the 10+ miles just to get a sandwich from here! Well worth the drive, get tons of sandwich for your $."}
{"text":"Finally a sandwich place that you do not have to ask for more meat. There sourdough bread is delicious, I like it toasted. I had the pastrami sandwich last time and I couldn't believe how much pastrami they gave me. Today I had the tuna sandwich and the quality of tuna was out of this world."}
{"text":"So NOT GOOD.  I really wanted to love this place as it is close to my home and I love a good sandwich. So here it goes....the bread was huge dry and fairly tasteless.  Had two sandwiches, Italian sub on Parmesan bread, and a turkey cranberry on sour dough.  I took pictures of the sandwich to send to my husband so he could see how laughable the sandwich looked. There was nothing in it!  Lettuce is cheap....could I please have more than a few shreds on my sandwich?  Lame.  Could go on, but it was skimpy in every way, all bread resulting in a flavorless, sad sandwich and customer.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in TOGO's last night on an impulse to get a sandwich. Store is small (but the name is TOGO, so not expecting big, sit-down place!) but very welcoming, bright and clean. The 3 people behind the counter were friendly and upbeat - they all seemed to enjoy what they were doing and working together. Ended up with Santa Fe Chicken Salad Wrap. The pepita dressing was excellent and the wrap was a good size. Also really like their Egg Salad (easier than making it myself!). Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Thanks Grace for making our 2 hour trip to TOGOS worth the drive. Very helpful on explaining the rewards points and the sandwhiches were yummy :)"}
{"text":"Great service, fresh produce, no lunch meats in paper trays, and healthy portions.  I had a great Reuben sandwich with no complaints.  For those who complain about the price, remember you get what you pay for.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"First time here! Not going to lie I was super nervous to try a new sub place. But I was very satisfied!! If you want cheap go to subway but if you want fresh tasting and great quality you get your dollars worth at togo's. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Let me say \"I love Togos.\" This location has the worst service I have ever experience at any Togos.  The kid making our sandwiches took about ten minutes to complete them and we had to \"coach\" him on how to make the sandwich.  There were 2 other employees just standing around watching tv.  The produce had obviously been out all day and I had to tell the kid not to put the brown avocado on my sandwich.  I expect more from this place. What a let down. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good, but not worth the high price. I honestly think it's not that much better than subway, but it's double the price. Good if you want to grab something quick."}
{"text":"I'm really happy they put this one! I was born in Cali and that was the only place I thought you could get Togo's Sandwiches. When my dad found it, I was so excited. I love Togo's Sandwiches!! So good!"}
{"text":"I'm really not sure why this place has been getting mediocre/bad reviews, it seems mostly for service. It was empty when I went in tonight and our sandwiches were made quickly and well by the male associate who helped us.   The food tastes just like the Togo's in California that I grew up eating. It was delicious, well portioned, and blows all other sub sandwich places out of the water. I didn't mind driving from Central Phoenix just to get my Togo's fix and I wasn't disappointed! The quality and taste surpasses Jersey Mikes, Subway, and Jimmy Johns (the main sandwich places in the Valley)."}
{"text":"This place is awful! The bread is really thick and dry. The meat was processed and not fresh. The choices of ingredients is small and they were not fresh. My avocado was Brown and rotten tasting. I wrote a review the day I went and it was removed. I guess this place doesn't want people to know how bad they are. My grandparents live in the neighborhood where this location is and that's why I tried it out that day. Word has spread in that area not to waste $10 on the worst sandwich there is."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times. I am disappointed. They have never made my order correctly and for the price it hardly has any ingredients and very little meat in the wraps. I asked twice for olives and pickles. It sucks when your hungry and your meal does very little to satisfy you."}
{"text":"LOVE IT! I grew up getting Togo's every Saturday with my family back in California! I recently moved to Gilbert & I am so glad there is a Togo's near by!! I come at least once a week & often times being my pup along! If you haven't been, you MUST! The staff is also amazing & makes sure your sandwich is just the way you want it!"}
{"text":"Just a bit of history. Togo's was founded by a San Jose State student named Mike in 1975 who complained that the only place to eat in the area was the cafeteria at the college. He rented an old house a block away, hired a bunch of attractive girls, came up with a decent sandwich menu and the lines were long. I lived a few blocks away and ate there at least 4-6 times a week with the #9 and #16 being my regular selections. The original Togo's in Phoenix were franchises, one in Scottsdale and one in Gilbert combined with a Baskin Robbins. The Owner of the Gilbert store passed away suddenly and the family didn't want to continue in the business. The Scottsdale franchise also closed and there were no Togo's stores for several years. Having eaten in many different stores in California I must say that they were quite consistent in quality and service. The Guadalupe store is about average on my albeit not so frequent visits. Stick with the #9 or #16 and you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwich. Good service, and good price. I was not blown away. I will keep this in mind if I am in the mood for something very predictable."}
{"text":"Yay! I am so glad I found this Togo's! Having lived in NorCal - this brings back delicious memories of the #24 - turkey and avocado. The bread is soft and delicious, the avocado is tasty (they put so much on there - I generally ask to only have 1 scoop as it always seems to gush off) and the sandwich delicious. My only complaint would be the sandwiches would be better if they sliced their own meat (like Mr. Goodcents). However, a much much better option than that huge chain where their sandwiches are lettuce and bread."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches, had to take off a star for service. The person making my sandwich kept messing up, but other than that great quality sandwiches."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and have always loved togos, so we were excited to try this location. It's very clean, and the girls up front were very nice. However there apparently is a club in the back that was not advertised. You could hear loud music and thumping from the back, that was louder than the peaceful dining room music. I pointed out that it was very loud and the girl went in the back to turn it down, then it got even louder! Ya, not the best place to enjoy your meal. So if you're going for the club atmosphere then you hit it spot on. I will try other restaurants in the area from now on. My husband got the meatball sub and was not impressed, but again my soup/salad was good."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are incredibly good! The ladies who were working were incredibly kind. Can't believe I've never had these sandwiches but I will definitely be back!  I'd say get the triple dip, 3 hefty servings of meat, with cheese and veggies of your choice and au jus! So good!"}
{"text":"While driving around Chandler the other day, I happened to notice a Togo's delivery vehicle.  I thought, what?  Is Togo's back?  Well, yes it is - yea!  I have been eating at Togo's since 1979, and my favorites are the 21 (avocado and cheese) and 9 (hot pastrami).  In my opinion, none of the other sub shops - Jimmy John's, Jersey Mikes, Subway, Firehouse, etc. - come close to the quality and taste of a genuine Togo's sub.  I shall return soon!"}
{"text":"It was $7 for a 6 inch turkey sub. Now Subway has real turkey and charges under $5, so TOGO's needs to match that price. Nothing really stands out in the #3 (turkey and cheese), so there is no compelling reason to eat turkey anymore at this chain. Perhaps one final pastrami run in the future. The kids making the sandwiches also don't listen to what you want, so watch them closely. Not sure how many hours they pre-slice the turkey ahead of time, but no fresh slicing involved here either."}
{"text":"Every time I slither into this joint, there is no one there.....and I like that. Walk up to the counter, gather myself and then order something that I know I wont be able to finish but will never back down from the challenge. Their guac is very sexual (good). So, I suggest you put it on anything you order. You could just order a Diet Pepsi to go....put guac in it. I was pretty hungry when I ordered and all I could think about is laying on my couch like a slob and bearing down on the large portioned sub they always make. Before I knew it, I was still standing at the counter waiting for the artist to finish making the grub. \"Um yeah hello?.......did you fall asleep back there errrr...????\". this happens every single time I go there. The finished product is always good.....but....ya know.....15 mins waiting around by yourself pretending to make fake phone calls so you don't look like a creep gets kinda weird after awhile. Go get some food here, just bring a sleeping bag for a nap while its being made."}
{"text":"Ahhh..good old Togo's. This was my first visit in years since living in NoCal, where the chain started. The turkey quality doesn't look as good, but the chunky chicken salad is usually a safe choice along with pastrami. The salad on this day needed alot of help from the salt and pepper packets, but it was still a filling 6 inch sandwich. It's good that they put almonds in the chicken salad. Check in on YELP and get a free drink."}
{"text":"This place is within a 1/4 mile of where I live. I don't cook all that often and I still plan to avoid this place unless things get really desperate at home.  It is no longer really about the new-factor anymore in my opinion. The service is quite fine, but it's just the quality that turns me off from ever recommending this place.  I ordered a half chicken salad sandwich. I should mention that I am really pleased that Togos posts nutrition facts and uses light mayo in their chicken and tuna salads. Regardless, the salad itself tasted just bad. The scoop was tiny, and overwhelmed by the doughy bread it was served on. There was more lettuce and tomatoes than chicken salad on my sandwich so it just completely tasted like a waste of any chicken salad at all. What I did get from the chicken was just the flavor of salty mayo.   I try not to be high maintenance with my sandwiches and I'm just disappointed. Jimmy johns is a much better option if you're in a pinch for a healthy and quick sandwich."}
{"text":"I am so happy Togos is back in AZ they are a bit higher priced than other sandwich places, but it is worth the money! I love love the #9 hot pastarami sandwich and it is amazing every time i get it!!! I would like to suggest offering an extra large size drink though, seems Subway has them beat on drink sizes, but I will forever be a togos customer!!! Put one in Chandler!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend is from norther California and she was craving a slice of Home. TOGO'S is from the San Jose area and we are both big fans. This Arizona establishment is exactly what she was looking for! Big helpings of both meat and avocado go great with the San Francisco style sourdough bread! The staff was very friendly and made everything exactly how we like. 5/5 great chain in the TOGO'S line!"}
{"text":"This place was wonderful even though I've eaten at this location only a couple of times. The sandwich I got was the pastrami with avocado and it was fabulous. The young Asian kid made it for me and he even recommended the avocado saying it tastes wonderful with it, so I took a chance and boy am I glad I did! When I come back to Gilbert I'll definitely be going here to eat their delicious sandwiches. The older woman which I presume to be the manager rang me up. She was wonderful and always had a smile on her face. The device was great. Won't find a place like this, great service and wonderful sandwiches."}
{"text":"Not as good as the togos in California, staff was not very friendly music was too loud and dining area was dirty. Will not be back"}
{"text":"Do NOT go here. I just got cussed out by 2 employees and the manager did nothing.  I'm a doc working at a nearby clinic. I placed an order through their app. It was not ready. The manager told them to start making the sandwich. They were debating and blaming me for it not going through. I showed them the approval page. Then while making the sandwich, the female started correcting the young kid making my sandwich. A debate broke out about how many pieces of meat go on the sandwich. I told them to please do training later, and just finish my sandwich, I have to be back at work immediately; thus the pickup. This is where both the employees started cussing at me. Both were using Sh** words, F**** words, etc. HORRIBLE!! The manager did nothing! I am embarrassed for corporates sake. I am calling corporate for sure. Unbelievable. DO NOT GO HERE!!! Do not support this kind of business/management. I have received absolutely no appropriate communication or from corporate. I got a canned response that they would look into it."}
{"text":"Didn't know this TOGO'S was tucked away in here. Haven't been to one in two years.   I arrived at 12:15 on a Tuesday and it was 1/4 full.   I ordered the large Hot Pastrami Combo. They do not skimp on meats here. Stuffed full of hot, succulent Pastrami, fresh veggie choices and four types of bread. I have always loved the whole pepperoni option.   My lunch arrived as ready within five mins. I should've ordered the medium cuz I struggled with the large sandwich. So yummy.   There is a TV plus rather loud music."}
{"text":"There aren't many TOGO in AZ, but they do offer some good food at a fair price, and that works for me.   In truth, I really enjoy TOGO's Pepperjack Pastrami. Mind you, this isn't Chompie's or Goldberg's Deli pastrami, but it's decent.  I also like how generous they are with the amount of meat they put on their subs.  I haven't observed any scale here, it just seems they mostly eye ball it. Nice.   Expect to pay $7 for their 6\" and $9 for their 9\", or similar to Firehouse, or Which Wich prices.  So Three Stars, A-Okay."}
{"text":"I spent many years living in California and loving Togo's so I was happy to see one in my area in AZ again. Unfortunately it just wasn't the same. There was nothing wrong with the sandwich, it just didn't live up to my memory.  We ordered the #16 (the Italian), a meatball, and a tuna and drinks which came to $31.00. The bread was a bit chewy and they were a little heavy on the vinaigrette but otherwise everything was ok. My sons meatball sandwich was overloaded with meatballs since they had a couple extra but he was not complaining.  The service was slow but friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Great sandwich place! Very clean and inviting and the staff are friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service, Mark I believe, was phenomenal. He was friendly, informative and helpful.  The food was last really good. The cranberry turkey on wheat was flavorful and fresh, plus the portions were large. They had a nice selection of breads, cheese and toppings. The only reason for a 4 vs 5 star because it  as really good, but not \"the best\". That being said, I wouldn't hesitate to stop here again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I can say without a shadow of a doubt this was probably one of the worst sandwiches I've ever had in my life. To start with the prices are ridiculous. $30 for two sandwiches, two chips and soup.  The bread was the worst sandwich bread I've had.  I don't know if they overmixed it's, over proofed it, or under baked it. Whatever they did to it it was pretty bad.   And their so-called famous meatballs were the most bland pieces of tough meat I have had in a very long time. Their zesty sauce has zero zest and was too sweet for my liking. It was huge flavorless mess of hot, sweet tomato sauce and meat boulders.  The soup was gray. I ordered broccoli cheese and it was gray. It smelled terrible, and had a chemical taste. I'm glad I tasted it first. I ordered it for my toddlers and I would not feed it to them. I am sick to my stomach.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"My first time in the other day.   My first impression was \"what is that stink\"  This place smells horrible.  Don't know what it is, but something is not right.   Was going to eat there, but left because of the smell. The sandwich was ok.    No complaints about the food.    I was reading other reviews, and someone else commented on the foul smell.    My suggestion to the management, owner.   Find out what that smell is and fix it ASAP. The people at the gym across the street said that they don't go in there because it is too overwhelming  THAT HORRIBLE STINK IS STILL THERE.   SMELLS LIKE A DEAD ANIMAL IN THE a/c System. Disgusting!"}
{"text":"I love patronizing small, family owned businesses like this Togo's.   You find father/ daughter, mother/ son all trying to make it fun. They ask sincere questions and you get to know them as a person who wants your repeat business. That's what I found both here, and at Togo's in Scottsdale -- friendly employees, and owners.   Most sub places have a rule of limiting the amount of cold cuts, or processed meat, to either three or four ounces for their medium and large sandwiches.   At Quiznos, you can actually watch them add or subtract based upon what the scale is weighing. It's a real turnoff.    My rule of thumb -- always look for the bartender who is a generous pour!  But Togo's employees just grab the tongs the amount that feels right, all the while continuing their conversation with you. Wow, what a novel concept. Real people, real conservations.   Mind you, I don't go out to lunch expecting to make friends, or influence people LOL. But it's better than finding someone who's just killing time between classes and would prefer being anywhere else.   Now PRICES for these sandwich shops are going up, Togo is no exception. But their prices seem more reasonable when compared to Firehouse, or Which Wich.   Expect to pay $10-$12 for a large 9\" Sub and a drink; which is $3 less than the other two places mentioned above. Btw try their Pastrami, it's not bad. That's an east coast way of saying it's pretty good!  Again, this Togo's is Four and a Half Stars. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I had high expectations, apparently there are a lot of loyal followers of this CA sub shop. I decided to check it out today because I had a coupon. Needless to say I wasn't too impressed. I ordered the #1 chicken sub. The lady took about 5 minutes to put it togther, She wasn't much of a talker. She spent about 3 minutes taking meat on and off while the sandwich was on a scale trying to hit their magic mark, I understand the need for quantity control, but seriously! After making the sandwich, she whispered \"hold on\" while she walked in the back room a couple times for some unknown reason. If the food was good, the service would be forgiveable. I paid about $6.50 for the sandwich alone (the chips and drink were free thanks to the coupon). Without the coupon this would have put me in the $9-$10 range for a 6\" sub, a little pricey considering there is a sandwich shop on every corner charging less. Why the two-star rating? The bread was a little stale, this could possibly be because I think it was stored in a fridge, it was a little cold. You can't see the available toppings and the girl behind the counter is not personable enough to tell you what they got. I had a couple pieces of chicken that were unedidable and hard, not sure why, it wasn't bone but maybe ligament, ethier way quality food shouldn't be that way. They also tried charging extra for cheese (what other sandwich place does that???). On a positive note, the dining room is well laid out, very comfortable and plenty of seating. They have a nice outdoor seating area that is well misted. They also have China Mist Passion Fruit Ice Tea, which is awesome. I am still on the fence on whether not I will give it another try, I might come back to try out a salad or wrap, but most likely not the sandwich."}
{"text":"Bread was dry, veggies not very fresh. Like a worse version of subway with not as many ingredients."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have left disappointed here. The first is when they just opened. I will let that one go....   My boyfriend ordered first and this is where the problems started. He ordered the meatball sub.  The girl making the sandwich asked what type of bread he wanted (sourdough) and  confirmed he wanted provolone cheese then started throwing on the meatballs. The thing is, sourdough doesn't taste very good when cold and the warm meatballs were on top of cold cheese... She didn't even offer to toast the sandwich that is typically served hot! When he asked her to toast the sandwich to be toasted after she had made it, it was apparently an inconvenience to her and she just made a mess and STILL gave it to us.  When I ordered my sand which she was already over it, apparently. If I asked a question, I got a one word response.... I also wanted my sand which toasted, but again wasn't offered. I just dealt with the gross cold sourdough.... There are better options in the area... doubt i will be returning."}
{"text":"Love this place. The sandwiches are awesome, taste fresh and they pile the stuff on. The employees are always friendly and the place is always clean. Just a good sandwich place that's a better option than Subway."}
{"text":"The sourdough bread was hard and boring flavor. Broccoli cheddar soup overly processed.  Better sandwiches elsewhere, like Lox Stock & Bagels."}
{"text":"It might not be fair to say I was not only raised in Santa Clara, and That I also lived on Benton St, but it's my baseline for how I remember my favorite spot as a young man. I was witness as this chain grew and grew and grew. The Bay Area first, then SoCal, then Az. Once they opened in Az I tried many times at Town and Country and Shea but It was never any better then just ok. I have been getting social media marketing overload from the latest Az unit, but its out of the way and today was the day I finally made it in.  Upon entering it was noticeable that all 3 employees had set up camp in the lobby and had to get up to take our order at 11:30. I would think that should be a lunch rush, but the place was EMPTY. During our entire stay till around noon not another sole had come in and the staff resumed life at base camp in the lobby.  The sandwich... #9 has been craved for years, and oh I have eaten many from 1976-1985 near my Campus of Buchser High, and SCU. I also have many fond memories of a efficient, bustling, and energetic Togos. I remember the pans of hot steaming Pastrami that the sandwich makers would dip the tongs in to fill your sandwich. Today with modern technology a microwave is used to warm the cold pastrami as its ordered. The taste was close but it was the bread itself that was way off. The bread was probably better then day old and the crust cracked but not in a tasty crunchy way.  I tried again, and I do feel bad for the Arizona Franchise owners that have never found the magic of one of the greatest sandwich shops ever opened."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place multiple times. There is not really much options in the area for food. Not a main stream shop from what I am use too.  So today I was working in the area and decided to take a chance.  I am very content I did! There tuna sandwich is the best I have had in a long time! Taste is very satisfying , and the portions are healthy! Next time I am going to try one of there pastrami options.   Communication workers get a 10% Discount.  Grace is a sweetheart. Stop by and say hi."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and great service. If you haven't tried a Togo's Sandwich yet you have to go! The pastrami is really great, and the roast beef with the sriracha sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"A gem that I just found in the McCormick Ranch area!! Absolutely delicious, with great service and a great & varied menu!! This is my new place when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"We love TOGO's. There is never anyone in here when we come, so I'm not really sure how this place stays open. It's in the strangest complex and honestly I would have never even known about it had my friend not told me. They should relocate this place to a good corner for sure!  We always come for their special on Saturdays. I really like their bread, it's actually a thick decent size bread. Nothing compared to the nasty flat bread at subway. They do not skimp on the toppings either. Warning though, if you ask for extra mayo/mustard, wait for them to apply it first then decide if it's enough. They will literally drown your sandwich in it..... like A LOT.   My only negative so far is that I placed and order online to be ready at 3. My boyfriend went to pick it up and it wasn't ready. They made him wait awhile for the person with a large order in front of him only to find out they never even made our order. I thought that the point of ordering ahead was to have the sub ready to pick up when you arrive. It took them some searching to even figure out what I had ordered online. This was a little disappointing, and this was the only time my sub was also really sloppy like it was all just smacked in there quickly. I would think after the miscommunication with the order they would offer some type of coupon for a returning visit, but nothing."}
{"text":"Wow...what a sandwich! My husband and I took a chance on Togo's because we have never had it before. The sandwiches seemed on the medium size so I wasn't sure if would be very fulfilling. I was so wrong!  I had the turkey avocado on honey wheat  and he had the pastrami on honey wheat. There was so much avocado on mine, it was delicious and the turkey was carved perfectly and tasted very good. My husband's pastrami had a ton of meat and it was so flavorful. Also, the bread was the best bread I've ever had at a sandwich shop. Tasted fresh baked! We kept saying it was so much sandwich!  Needless to say we found out new place to-go...pun intended! ;)"}
{"text":"I am so excited to FINALLY find Togo's!  I have not been able to find a decent sandwich shop since moving here from So Cal so imagine my surprise to stumble upon my favorite place from back home.  They have great portions and prices to match.  Needless to say I will be heading back to Togo's again very soon."}
{"text":"I was on a relaxing drive Saturday afternoon and was in the mood for a Reuben, so I pulled up the trusty Yelp app and typed in Reuben sandwiches, a few places popped up and TOGO'S caught my eye. It was about 15 minutes away from where I was so I decided to peruse a few reviews. It didn't take long to chose  them as the place I would try. Why not? I enjoy trying new places and the food sounded good. I cruised in their direction, entered the building and was greeted immediately. The 2 ladies working up front were both so welcoming, pleasant and cheerful. They were almost as excited that it was my first time there as I was. Well, long story short, I loved my Reuben!! It was an amazing sandwich, I am so glad I looked on the app and found this gem. Honestly I don't live in the area the shop is and I probably never would have stopped if everything didn't align the way that it did, and I'm glad it did. Stop by TOGO'S if you're in the mood for a good sandwich, you won't be disappointed and if everyone that works there are as wonderful as the women working Saturday, you'll feel like you're not just a customer, but family."}
{"text":"My friend Georgie M has said of the quantity of Togo's meat and cheese in their sandwiches, \"always look for the bartender who is a generous pour!\" How true and how well this place matches that statement, thumbs up here.  Their pastrami, their best seller, is delicious and served heated to bring out all the flavor, a must try!  My wife had hers with pepperjack cheese melted into it with the extras (no extra charge) of lettuce, tomato, pickle, onions, and pepperoncinis.  I had the multi meat Italian sandwich that had mortadella, capicola, salami, ham, provolone & Italian dressing, served Togo's Style, wow, delicious and so filling, burp!  You can't go wrong here and you will be spoiled and not want to eat at any other sandwich shop."}
{"text":"I have visited this location many many times. I work nearby and place my order online. I decided to write a review today because I am getting tired of my order being wrong. I select the options online that are available yet they still keep adding extras to my wrap that I have to go back and pick off. The first time my order was correct, last two times it was wrong. Today I placed an order online and tried to call the restaurant afterwards to be sure that I wasn't going to get mounds and mounds of peppercinis and pickles like I have been. The phone line has a recorded message that the line is busy and it has said that for several minutes. I went to the restaurant to pick up my order and I asked the girl if the sandwich had peppercinis and pickles on it. She said yes it does. I asked her why it gets added since it's not listed as something that would be on the order, and she said that the system lists all the products. I told her that the phone line was saying it was busy and she said yes my boss is on the phone. Why would you tie up with the phone line during lunch hour when do you could potentially be getting lunch orders?    My husband refuses to go there because he said he hates how the manager or owner sets up shop at one of the tables by the register. Isn't there an office in back? He said he always feels like the guy is staring.   I will also agree with another reviewer that they seem to always be sitting at a table when I come in and rush to the counter.   Overall the food tastes good most of the time. I'm just frustrated with the process of ordering and the service. Such a bummer because I want to like them.   Also I should mention I order online so I don't have to spend time waiting for my order to be prepped since I only have a 30 min lunch hour."}
{"text":"I came in today because of all the great reviews.  I got the turkey sandwich on white and it wasn't all that impressed.  I was very disappointed in the topping selection (very few toppings).  I gave 3 stars because the bread was good and they do put an above average amount of meat, but other than that, nothing spectacular.  May try it again when I'm in the mood for a hot sub."}
{"text":"They put way to much dressing on my sandwich.  I tried rating it. Tried removing it but it didn't work. So the girlfriend went up and asked them to make a new sandwich.  I asked the guy should i toss my sandwich he says yes.  Then he tries to charge me for a new sandwich.  Why would i pay for a sandwich th ey messed up.  Why would you drench a sandwich in dressing.  The bread was soggy.  All i taste is dressing.  Guess i go to subway for now on"}
{"text":"So-so. It didn't stand out from other sub places. I wasn't impressed. I might return if there is absolutely no where else to go."}
{"text":"I just had a wonderful sandwich tonight, I also found out all the produce is grown locally. The sandwich was very fresh and tasty and the service was great,"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! They have lots of gluten free options and I think they are priced well! I go in at least once a week for their broccoli and cheese soup!! It's the best I have ever had!! And I alway have great service!"}
{"text":"No, this is not a gourmet sub shop.  It is probably the equivalent to a Jimmy Johns, better than a Subway.  They make a good, solid sandwich, but the main reason I write this review is how friendly the staff was.  I've never been to a sandwich shop with such friendly staff.   Very clean too!  I used to stop at Subway after my workout, but from here on out it will be ToGo's."}
{"text":"Found out that they had local stores, so had to check it out. Great memories of Togos from my college days in Sacramento.  Had the  turkey and avocado and the pastrami sandwich. Split them with my son. Tasted just like I remember. No five dollar foot long here, but the quality and taste are superior. I will be back."}
{"text":"After being a Togos fan for many years I think our relationship has come to an end.  The last two visits to get 2 sandwiches to go were beyond terrible.    My husband's pastrami was so bad it ended up in the garbage.   It smelled rancid and there were really no pieces of meat, just crumbs.    My turkey/cranberry was also bad.   The \"turkey\" had no resemblance to the taste of turkey and the parmesan bread was so stale it was crumbly.  The price of the sandwiches do not reflect the quality of years gone by.  Might as well go to Subway."}
{"text":"Love this place, great customer service!! Their chicken salad wrap is amazing!! 5 starseasily!"}
{"text":"My first time at a TOGO's and I definitely liked it. Happy to see a new sandwich spot in the 'hood. My 6 year old loved his sandwich, and I was happy to pay only about $5 for the kids meal. I look forward to returning to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are always delicious. Super fresh and good portions. Choice between a regular size and large for the sandwich and the regular is more than enough but I sometimes go large to have a second half to eat later. I wish there were more Togo's around!!"}
{"text":"Not the togo's i grew up with. This location does not honor the Corporate rewards deals. Do not waste your time. Your better off driving to palm springs togos. I predict this location will close like the tempe location very soon. Just not worth the drive 40 mile round trip to have bait and switch pulled on you. To say it has piss poor management would be a understatement."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Togo's by my boyfriend, orginially from California. I love sandwiches so of course, I was excited to try a new place. It's about a 10 minute drive from his house (about 20 minutes from mine) so we decide to head over from his place on a sunday afternoon. To my delight, it just happens to be my favorite sandwich as the daily special (turkey and avocado). How awesome!! We decide to order two sandwiches each, one for now and then one for later since the prices are great for the daily special. The sourdough bread is great but a little hard to eat so if you're looking for a softer bread, I'd go with the parmesean. Similar to subway, you are able to add your own toppings but cheese is extra. Sandwiches are stuffed full of goodies and just thinking about it makes me want to eat one now!!  The only negative (for me at least) is that it seems to take a long time for them to make the sandwiches. So, if you're in a hurry, I'd call ahead to order or just plan to be there a little while. My boyfriend and I now dub \"Togos\" as our sunday afternoon treat spot and have been several times since it opened. Staff is extremely friendly and the place is spotless. Totally love and will keep coming back!!"}
{"text":"Oh my TOGOS is back!!! Just like back home in San Jose, Ca. Great sandwiches. Delicious Broccoli Cheddar Soup!!! Ill be back!!! Great service too!!"}
{"text":"Togos is back in Chandler!! Had my favorite #24 and partner had toasted veggie wrap with avacado added...so good! Thanks for bringing back my California memories!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest with you, I love their sandwiches! I do. I am a TOGO's fan! I celebrate the chain's entire menu!  For my money, it doesn't get any better than when they make me a roast beef with pepper jack on sourdough."}
{"text":"Only sandwich place, I know of, to offer a gluten free wrap.  Usually have to order a salad, its really good to be able to have a sandwich.  The food is good and so are the prices!  Wish there were more locations."}
{"text":"Been to this location several times, figured it was time for a review. The sandwiches are huge here, I made the mistake the first time of getting a large, now a get a regular which is perfect..get the large if you're starving. My wife can't even finish the regular size. I always get the pastrami #9, never ventured from that yet but I probably should.. It's just so damn good.. Ha Be sure to check out their daily specials menu and join their member club to save some ca$h.   Been here several times and will continue to go there. The owner is a great guy as well."}
{"text":"Being a northern Cali guy. You know it's not going to be what you think from the old town. I ordered the # 9...OK CA you know the # 9 . I hate to scale weight, I'm paying  $ 8.00 for a foot long, bring on the meat. The staff were great. put up with my old story's of the original story me and my wife went too.  Problem: bad location, had to look to find in a strip mall.  But still good place to get a sandwich."}
{"text":"I was tired of the same old thing so decided to try TOGO Gilbert yesterday.  I am so glad I did!  I had the #9 Hot Pastrami the TOGO way.  Best sandwich I have had since I ate a hot pastrami at the Carnegie Deli in New York years ago!  I got their wheat bread which is terrific and it was piled high with the sandwich.  It was delicious!  I liked it so well, we ordered everyone at the shop sandwiches today!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, attentive staff, clean atmosphere.  A welcome addition to the army of sandwich restaurants in my area & perhaps the best quality of them all."}
{"text":"On my way to an appointment and couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the sign for Togo's!! I thought they were all closed in the valley. I was so sad when the one by me was closed...and have not found a good chicken salad sandwich since! To my great pleasure, I stopped in and got the #29 (still the same!) fabulous chicken salad sandwich. The mix includes sliced almonds and celery and onions too. Yum! I don't know when I will get back to that neck of the woods again, but I will be sure to stop in at Togo's!"}
{"text":"Stopped into ToGo's for the first time today for lunch. Walking in the door I was greeting by a funky odor. It didn't smell like bread, it didn't smell like cleaning products. Maybe it was the soup of the day? Maybe the ham had turned? Whatever it was, it should have been a sign to turn around.   I went up to the counter and the woman working said something to me about a dog and I was obviously confused. I said \"what?\" and she looked at me and said \"hi\" like I was the crazy one. Then the woman ahead of me in line came back and it turns out the dog conversation was relevant to her. So another guy came up, saved me from this awkward moment and took my order.  I got the turkey and cheese on parmesan bread. It looked good in the picture but this sandwich was awful. The bread is way too thick and dry. It didn't taste fresh at all. The turkey had no flavor. The mayo had no flavor. It was bland, boring and blah. I would have rather gone to Subway. And I hate Subway.  ToGo's? More like NoGo's."}
{"text":"Had Togo's for the first time this weekend. We came in early on a Sunday afternoon. I decided to order the French dip on sourdough and my fiancé had the turkey avocado which was the special of the day. The owner was there and she talked to us about how popular the Togo's chain was in California and gave us a little background history on the company which I thought was nice. She was very welcoming.   The French dip that I ordered I was not impressed with. The sourdough was a little bit too sour for my tastes and really overpowered the sandwich. If I ordered it again I would order it with a different bread but I didn't think that the meat had much flavor either. My fiancé had the turkey avocado and was not a big fan of that either. He had the whole wheat bread which he said was good and fresh but the sandwich did not have much flavor in general.  They did have Pepsi products which is a plus in my book. Customer service was very good. They have quite an extensive menu and I would give them a shot again to try a different type of sandwich. Overall first impression was that the sandwiches that we had did not wow me but I will give them another shot while in the area."}
{"text":"Today I tried there New Chicken Caprese wrap and it was great! Inside the wrap: grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella , slice of tomatoes, lettuce and some pesto. Everything wrapped in a spinach tortilla! So yummy! Normally I order the Asian chicken salad, great too!"}
{"text":"My mother up talked this business from here olden days in Cali. I like how they have a great selection of deli favorites and a friendlish staff just she seemed annoyed when my mother didn't order fast. New customers should be treated with respect. I just think it was the provider because I asked the guy and he was much nicer. I still prefer jimmy johns. I like when they put what they believe is the best way instead of picking and choosing. Maybe I just picked the wrong sandwich toppings but I was not impressed.  I won't be back unless my mom selects this on her way home, it's too pricey and rushed for the a sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Yes when I travel for my job sometimes it's the only place that's nearby that's cheap"}
{"text":"Every time I come in I get service with a smile. Thank goodness I have you guys down the street just like in California. Good looking location never too busy and always fast service."}
{"text":"Yes I agree, the girl didn't offer to toast my sub, however, they still pack a big punch with a list of 30 different sandwiches. Great selection, amazing watermelon tea, and an employee that really knew the menu."}
{"text":"Never been here only heard about it from people and i was missing out.  The staff was very friendly and walked us through making the sandwiches. Also letting us know which are top sellers.  The cranberry turkey I felt needed more cranberry and heates because I wanted it to taste like thanksgiving. The bread is fluffy and ingredients are fresh ."}
{"text":"First time being here! The services was amazing and I got the California sandwich and it was so good.. I will defiantly will be back :)"}
{"text":"Andrew stood out to me as he gave us such great service and went over and above to make sure we were satisfied with our order! Thank u for the wonderful service Andrew and for making us a great sandwich and salad!"}
{"text":"It have been a long time Togo lover from my California days, and I actually almost bought a couple franchises. Togo's had a cult following like \"In And Out Burger\" and should have went nationwide like subway, but for some reason never did when they merged with another company.  I hear they are on their own now and starting to grow again which is exciting too see.  I stopped in today and ordered the number nine pastrami like old times.  The young man at the counter was very nice and made a very nice sandwich and I did not have to repeat myself over and over like in other places to get my special order just right.   The sandwich brought back some great memories of a hot pastrami so delicious.   I love the way they now toast the bun, drain the water out of the Pastrami, and do any other special requests you have with a smile. The other nice thing is they still put a lot of Pastrami on it and  have deli mustard verses the standard generic mustard which is a must for me on a Pastrami sandwich.  Not many places even have pastrami sandwiches any longer unless you are fortunate enough to find a deli, so I am glad to have rediscovered Togo's.    I got the chance to meet the owner who was onsite and very nice and he was a joy to talk the history of Togo's and where they are going.   I look forward to my next Pastrami sandwich!"}
{"text":"I have come here many times, they don't have a rewards program, but the sandwiches are super delicious! There are many tables to sit at and they also have cute outside seating too. There is usually never a wait to get your food. The employees are so pleasant and nice. There is a tip jar at the cash register, I put a dollar change in it.       I love the tuna sandwich it has bits of celery and they give generous portions of meat and cheese. The chicken Salas's is the best I've ever had! (so far!) The Italian sub has so much meat in it, perfecto! Your choices are tomato, lettuce, guacamole, banana peppers, onions, and various condiments. The bread is SO much better than Subway's too!"}
{"text":"I been to this location many times and it never lets me down. I am a California native and every time I go in its a little taste of home with their amazing bread and packed sandwiches. If you ever had true San Francisco sour dough theirs is amazing! On top of it all the staff is amazing they really care about how your sandwich looks and tastes. Keep up the great work Togo's!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwiches. I really liked the selection! And I have to say it's refreshing to find a restaurant that has the calories listed next to the menu items! Great daily specials and they even have a daily soup. I got the pastrami Reuben and it was great! Yummy fresh bread."}
{"text":"Driving around Phoenix we decided to try this Californian chain.  Surprisingly the food was delicious and the staff was excellent!  They assisted  with the menu choices and put the perfect amount of veggies on each sandwich.  We got their albacore tuna, southwest salad, turkey Cheddar, roast beef, veggie wrap and roast beef sandwich, which were all amazing.  I would definitely recommend trying any other sandwich on the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here for lunch and were very happy with the meal.  We both got the daily special, which was the hot pastrami sandwich.  It was delicious and piled high with pastrami.  I liked that the bread was very soft because a lot of sandwich places have hard bread and when you bite into the sandwich all of the meat falls out.  Not the case here since the bread was soft.  We both got the regular size sandwich and it was definitely more than enough for each of us."}
{"text":"So, I had never been to a Togo's before and was pleasantly surprised at how loaded their sandwiches are. I got the (#9) pastrami sandwich and it was amazing.   As I was getting ready to leave I got up to use the bathroom and that's when this really unsettling feeling hit me. I looked down at the floor and next to the bathrooms, in plain sight, were two boxes dedicated to trapping insects/mice. The best part? One of them appeared to have little fecal pellets in them.   I get it- rodent problems in AZ, I just don't like to see it advertised. It may be a while before I can stomach coming back here again."}
{"text":"Was disappointed today. We went there and there was a line and there was one man helping a customer, one woman at the cash register and the other woman just standing there and not helping the customers. She eventually started helping after she saw the line grow. For that I think it was poor customer service. The sandwich I was disappointed in. I got the #24 and my avocado was just thrown on there and just a huge chunky ball. It was a huge sandwich for the price. I could only eat one half of the regular, but majority of it was bread and that's it. Probably never will go to one again."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Was not very impressed. Very bland sandwich. When compared to a sandwich next door at FRY'S, it isn't worth the extra money. Only positive is they carry Pepsi products.   Had the tuna and the roast beef. Not to much to talk about for a $6 sandwich. I loved Togos from Ca and was actually let down."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find a togos in Phoenix.  I grew up on togos in Gilroy, Ca. A great childhood memory.  A great quality sandwich shop that I highly recommend.  The best pastrami sandwhich I've ever had. Their ingredients taste so fresh. Lots of meat unlike some places. I will be honest that I love the pastrami sandwich so much that I haven't ordered much else from their menu. When you love something why change it. For those of you who haven't heard of togos go try it. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"So glad they opened one up in Chandler. I had the pastrami as usual with a half Asian salad. Its just like I remember from my college days and definitely did not disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. The employees have no idea what there doing.I used to work at a Togo's it's not that hard to make a sandwich. On my visit I ordered a Turkey and avocado sandwich the employee burnt my bread and blamed it on the sugar content and refused to remake my sandwich so I had to at for the sandwich witch was unadible I won't be back"}
{"text":"I ate here while I waited for my wife to do an exercise class at the LA Fitness.  I was very disappointed in the quality of the food here.  Subway is actually much better for about 2/3 the price.  I ordered the pastrami sandwich.  And because the sandwich is hot, they take the pastrami out of the refrigerator and microwave it to make it hot.  At least Subway uses a small oven to heat it and toast the bread.  The bread isn't even toasted.  Then the mustard is just the regular yellow mustard and not the spicy deli style.  Overall, not a good place to eat, on the expensive side and I won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"I have been a Togos fan for many years and when they disappeared from the valley I was very disappointed.  So when I found they were opening around the corner from my house you could well image my delight.  When we first walked into the new one I was a little worried because I remember the decor of my previous visits to the old shops being much more lunch counter and this one was more like the run of the mill fast food style. I recalled one of my favorite sandwiches was a cucumber and avocado but did not snow it on the menu but when I asked they said I could order off menu.  The sandwich was good - a lot less ingredients than they used to serve but it was still delicious."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place many times and have always wanted to stop in. Finally did today and was very impressed with the staff. Awesome people 100%. I got the Salami and Provolone sandwich and it's amazing. I will be back to this place for sure! Thankyou Togos!"}
{"text":"Service was great! The staff took time to explain the sandwiches and the daily specials they have. The pastrami sandwich was stuffed full of tender meat. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I found this location by accident one day when leaving my satellite office and dreading having to order another sandwich from the napkin tyrants at a competitor. I had seen advertisements for Togo's, but had never tried them, so I gave it a shot. What a difference! Great food, napkins a-plenty, friendly staff.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they still seem a little overwhelmed during the busy times, but my orders (whether hot or cold) have always been right (and good)."}
{"text":"Quality of Italian sandwich was awesome.   Great meat portion.  Lots of dressing and just regular size sandwich was huge.  First time there and will definitely be going back to try other sandwiches."}
{"text":"I like Togos especially their classic sandwiches.  Sometimes you can get someone who might not be as good as the normal employee but be patient, they will get up to speed."}
{"text":"I'd drive by this place every time I went to the Starbucks next door and always wondered what it was. Finally made the lunch stop to check it out!  It's another sub shop, where you enter and order at a counter while they make it for you, then grab your finished sandwich and pay all at the front. They have a big board behind the counter showcasing all of their different items. This location has a daily special (at least during the weekdays) which is a regular sandwich and a drink for like $7. You can add on chips for an additional dollar. I went for the special which was tuna since it was a Friday.   They have different types of bread (white, wheat, sourdough and something with cheese), but I just stuck with classic white. They added mayo, lettuce, onion, tomatoes and pickles to the sandwich and I was pretty into it! It had good flavor and was a decent size. If I had the choice I would definitely come here before subway, just in comparison. It felt like their ingredients were better quality than the slimy stuff you get at other places.   The store was clean and the staff were nice. I saw other reviews that spoke about employees and the owner/manager sitting at tables by the register and I did notice this, however it didn't really bother me. Just a disclaimer if you're someone who doesn't like that."}
{"text":"This is supposed to be an albacore tuna sandwich, really what I received when I came home was a bread sandwich with a lot of lettuce, A LOT of onions, the cheese and bacon that I paid extra for but I literally had to scrape away these Toppings to try and find the tuna fish which is supposed to be most of the sandwich.  Very poor especially for an $11 sandwich.  Tasted like bread and onions.  Further, the cashier (as sweet as she seemed to be) didn't really know what she was doing, had a lot of trouble ringing it up, and then gave me a WARNING that next time she was going to have to charge me for bacon and cheese, even though my Total included these extras which I was expecting to pay for.  Overall, you shouldn't be even making a tuna sandwich if you cant actually put tuna on it."}
{"text":"Togos of Gilbert Arizona, in short, live up to the Togos name and legacy. As I entered the restaurant, I was greeted by friendly employees and a cleaniliness that rivals many operating rooms in hospitals. I ordered a sandwich and left pleasantly surprised that they actually used fresh ingredients. The meat was quite... well meaty, and the vegetables were incredibly leafy, like I was eating the forests of Nottingham. The sandwich I had was amazing, rivaling those of more renown, like the giants in New York City and in Germany. Very good for a chain. The owners have done Togos proud, and I wish them much success in the future."}
{"text":"This is a real gem hidden away!  It is well worth searching for and not too hard to find.  We stopped in a couple days ago for lunch and my wife commented it is the best sandwich place we have ever tried.  She had ordered the turkey with cranberry and loved it! I ordered the turkey and cheese in a 9\" and was only able to eat half of it.  The bread is great and very fresh with loads of meat and cheese.    We went back this evening and ordered the turkey and  cranberry in the 9\" and an Italian special in the 6\" for only $3.50 since it was after 4:00 PM.  They weren't very busy tonight and quickly took our order and got us on our way.  This is a great place and has a great staff.  It is off the beaten path but well worth looking for!"}
{"text":"I grew up in San Jose and started eating TOGO's in 1974 at store #1. I have always enjoyed a #9! I am sorry to say it's just not the same anymore. The bread was stale and The Pastrami was just ok! It has only gone up in $$ but it also seemed the meat was on the lite side as it did not fill the sandwich the 'TOGO's Way'! Lake many of the TOGO's Loyal Tribe it's just disappointing when you go and get this Poor of a quality of a sandwich. I can get that at SUBWAY!"}
{"text":"First time at Togo's was in SanJose.  So was very excited about there being one in the area when we moved to Phoenix.   We have vome to this store a few times over a few years.  Service has always been good.  Sandwiches are also pretty good.  The bread is the best."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time and was quite disgusted with the place first it smells like dog food when you walk in and second one of the employees was sitting behind the bar where they make your food and had her phone sitting on top of it sitting on Facebook and eating her lunch bent over the bar (the one where your food is prepared) it was quite disgusting!  Nonetheless I bought a sandwich and am now quite hesitant to even eat it!  I won't be back."}
{"text":"TOGO's is about as good as it gets for a \"franchise\" sandwich, and this location in particular is the best one I've ever been to. It's huge, well-run, with very friendly service, fast when busy, and consistent in quality & quantity. About a million times better than Subway, and a far better value as you actually get a reasonable amount of meat in your sandwich, unlike the other guys, where you get about a metric ton of lettuce and other fluff ingredients, hiding some wafer-thin slices of generic grocery case cold cuts. Give it a try if you've never been, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been a huge TOGO's fan for decades, so I'm a bit biased, but this location (and its sister location in Gilbert run by the same owners) are very good. The only downside of the new Chandler location is that it's tiny and cramped. The Gilbert location is huge. But both are well-run and are solidly in our regular lunch rotation. My personal faves are the pastrami and tuna (not together!). Orders of magnitude better than Subway, in both quality of product, and the generosity of ingredients (no BS poster showing 3x the actual meat you receive, as Subway somehow gets away with - criminal!)."}
{"text":"Got 6 sandwiches. Got home and the bread was stale, sandwiches were dry and very unsatisfied. I come from the Bay Area where Togos is the place to go, I had to search for one here and I should have known when I walked in I was the only customer.. I also got soup, they gave me half a cup because it ran out and even that was cold and they microwaved it won't come back to this one."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find this Togo's by accident a few months ago.  I am from California and there are Togo's everywhere, so I kinda took them for granted.  Not this one!  I have been here at least six times and probably more.  Every sandwich is perfect.  Staff is friendly.  Place is clean and comfortable.  Prices are reasonable.  Can't ask for more.  I try to stop in at least once a week."}
{"text":"Had been excited to see this was opening in Scottsdale.  I used to live in California and frequent TOGOS often.  I loved their sandwiches.   I am not sure when this location actually opened, but it is obvious they are still very much in the training phase. While I could tell my sandwich maker was trying and was pleasant you could just tell he was overworked and didn't seem to have any support staff.  His section was out of items and no one was quick to help him refill.   He was extremely pleasant and apologetic - I really felt bad for him. It wasn't until I was eating my sandwich did I realize the bread was wrong, but so be it. I hope the manager / owner who was walking around can jump in and start organizing and training a bit better.   I think they can be very successful in this location if they can just pull it together.  I'll probably give it another try, but maybe not anytime soon."}
{"text":"OK....let me start with...I have never been to this Togos but I have NEVER been to a Togos that I didn't like!!  Truly...my mouth is watering for the #16...my fav, the #9 my next fav and then the classic #24.  This place ROCKS!!  I grew up on Togos in California and have missed it since living here in the desert but now I have found one  and it'll be worth the 45 MILE drive!!!  Really...you should all try it!  Yummy!!!  :)"}
