{"text":"I would actually give 1 or 2 star at most for their ramen, however, I really want them to stay in business and I need good ramen in Toronto! Can they do better??  I am from Kyushu, Japan (where Tonkotsu ramen is originally from) so I know my expectation for ramen is too high. Of course I am not expecting a perfect bowl of ramen in Toronto. I just want a decent one.   I had the Kakuni Ramen (tonkotsu base soup) the other day at Raijin.  Soup is too sweet and creamy (like milk!?) and not salty enough. Flavor is not just bland, but weird and watery, too, there is no depth to the taste. I hope they are not adding dairy like milk or soy milk in it!!!!! I don't want to sound mean, but it tasted like \"hondashi (katsuo dashi) in creamy corn soup (no corn, but like the sweetness that comes from corn and milk)\". This is not tonkotsu ramen soup, folks... and it does not taste good at all....  The kakuni, noodles, and everything else was fine. More than decent. Love their decor. Please just make some changes to your soup!"}
{"text":"Went here for a very late lunch on a Saturday - I was in the area and decided to try it. It wasn't very busy but it was a time between lunch and dinner. The ramen was good but not the best I've had in Toronto. I liked that they had 2 sizes as I usually find it difficult to finish a regular size bowl. However, I found the menu a bit messy and disorganized - it was a stack of papers on a clipboard with too many options. There were also discount deals for Ryerson students. I would recommend this place only if you're in the area with a craving for inexpensive ramen."}
{"text":"While I understand the restaurant just relocate with limited menu, for what it offers the ramen is so so. As was the house made almond pudding and the octopus takoyaki. Shredded cabbage and bean sprout with one slice of pork on noodles hardly justify the kind of price. Sensotei further north and even Miss Korea towards Bloor and Yonge offer much tastier ramen noodle soup for less if not the same price. $1.80 for a tea bag green tea is a bit steep. The only thing that is positive is the seating which is better than many downtown area. Definitely not a place I would recommend. There are a few more alternatives along the Yonge street strip."}
{"text":"No lineup around 7:30 pm on a chilly Sunday night. Was planning to go to Santouka but lineup was out the door. So decided on Raijin Ramen. Ordered the Noukou Tonkotsu Shio Ramen. Took awhile for the ramen to get to the table. Pretty stingy on the pork. Noodles were decent. The soup base is the backbone of any ramen and this is were it just failed. My friend and I could not drink the soup as it was just oily. Left the place totally dissatisfied. A good ramen is were I would finish the soup. Lets hope they will learn from the mistake."}
{"text":"I'm no expert but it was delicious!! Tonkotsu broth was very rich and not too salty, so as chicken base. Tried their octopus ball which were also tasty."}
{"text":"The prices are very reasonable and the service was very attentive and quick.  The layout of the restaurant is great as you can see the chefs at work and you can even sit at a bar that faces the kitchen for a front row view.   Having been to other ramen restaurants notably the one on Dundas St. E. this was is very good but not excellent.  The portion size is very reasonable and the noodles were very tasty.  We thought that they could have put more meat in the dishes but they were very tender and flavourful.  The broth is good but not as good as the restaurant on Dundas, it seemed to lack a fullness to its flavour and could have been more rich tasting. I ordered the spicy ramen that could have been hotter, I had to add more hot sauce to get the spiciness I wanted. We had the dumplings for an appetizer which were good, out only complaint was that they were cooked at such a high heat they stuck together and were very difficult to pull apart. We will go back again and try some different dishes, most likely the poutine that looked amazing."}
{"text":"Visiting for the first time since it moved locations. The new spot is hidden behind a Rabba.   The new spot feels smaller since there is now a long table in the middle of the restaurant that is positioned diagonally. The 2 person tables are also very crowded together, making elbow space and private conversation rare.   I got the tonkotsu ramen and gyoza, but the portions sizes seemed way smaller than before. The Gyoza barely had any meat and was not crispy. Also got the karage and had to ask for mayo dipping sauce.   The new spot is not convenient, and small portions don't make the trip worth it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice,  first time everything seemed pretty good,  the soup  was great and service was okay,  second time, bland, terrible service,  better off going to santouka  or sansotei.  great atmosphere though,  not crowded with people,  and nice calm music."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend today.  Great service, convenient location, comfortable seating & a much bigger ramen restaurant then Kenzo, Kinton, Santouka, Sansotei or Niwatei.  Raijin has both bar and table seating.  Tried the tonkatsu shio ramen (9.50) & it was very creamy & delicious.  The sliced pork was seared and done just right.  And the runny egg was just perfect.  The whole ramen experience was very good.  My friend had the bamboo charcoal miso ramen ($11).  The soup was totally black & didn't look very appetizing!  The taste however is interesting.  You can't taste the charcoal, but I definitely prefer the pork bone broth.  The hot gyozas had nice paper thin skins and were tasty.  And at $2.50 for 5 pcs, it was very reasonable!  Green tea was $1.  Definitely will go back again!"}
{"text":"Soup was too salty! Only 1 slice (3/4 inch thick) of meat ! There are much better ramen places in Scarborough / Markham !  spend your $ elsewhere !"}
{"text":"Delicious ramen! I suggest the combos that are offered. They usually come with a salad, a chosen rice bowl with meat and ramen of your choice. Such an unforgettable experience!"}
{"text":"Decent Ramen noodles, maybe a bit skimpy on their servings but reasonable prices & no line-ups!  Went on a Monday evening at around 8 pm, there was no line up and service was fairly quick. I sat at the counter, it was fun watching the chefs.   Tried the clear broth soup - toridashi shoyu - pork was tender, noodles perfectly al dente. However, the broth was extremely salty (had to drink a ton of water afterwards) and I felt they skimped a little on the amount of pork and only half an egg. The gyoza had very thin skin and were small, but at $2.50 for 5 pieces, it helped fill me up after the noodles.  I will return to try their Charcoal noodles (apparently a detoxer) because it sounds like a unique dish. My server hadn't tried it yet, so I wasn't convinced to order it on my first visit. At the end of the day, my favourite Japanese noodle shop is still Manpuku, but if you want to satisfy a ramen craving and don't feel like facing a line up (as you would at some of the other recently opened ramen shops), this is a good option."}
{"text":"This place has a very Japanese look. Reminiscent of Japan. I would recommend one with the spicy soup. That soup is good, so good."}
{"text":"The place is decent in terms of its food. The service was really great (it also helped that we were a large group with a couple of Japanese individuals). The dish overall was alright. I had the chicken shoyu ramen. FYI, the combo is good if you are quite famished.   What I really enjoyed was the torimayo don. I know it's super simple, but it was good. So overall, this place is decent and I would not discount it as a place to go for some cheap eats (relatively speaking)."}
{"text":"This place is our go to ramen restaurant. It's got good food and much more comfortable than the other ramen places. You never have to wait for a table, you get a full chair (instead of a stool), there's space to get out of your chair and go to the washroom. Just a much more pleasant experience. The food is fantastic as well. I had the veggie ramen which was very good. The hubby had the miso tonkatsu, which was yummier. And if you check in on FB, you get a free topping! Staff is super friendly as well. It will continue to be my go to ramen joint."}
{"text":"3.8/5. Ordered a miso ramen and gyoza, both were a bit on the salty side. I like how the noodles are just perfect, not too soft or firm, then the meat is amazing!! Melts in your mouth.! Soup is 3.5/5 if they put less salt is 5/5!  I am sure you will appreciate the noodles and meat here!' They are one of the best i have tried in toronto!  Gyoza (dumplings) are ok, crisp on outside and soft inside but the meat in there is not quite enough! Other than that, this ramen is pretty good! Dont mind to come again but wont crave for it!  I actually find that they are quite inconsistent, last time i had it their soup tasted so good! More creamy and less salt!"}
{"text":"Love the flavorful and rich broth but no so much the waxy textured noodle, especially for tsukemen the noodle is too thin to absorb the broth and flavor. Also, I wish their rice bowls can have less rice and more meat. Overall more like 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Great prices on appetizers. Can't beat their prices on those and their delicious.   Their ramen is on par with the other hyped ramen restaurants. Their soup is creamy and filling and different from the other places."}
{"text":"3.5*s   Great decor and friendly staff.  Came here on a fall Tuesday night and there were plenty of tables free.  This place has great pricing and cheap drinks.  Ramen noodles are decent but the broth can't stand up to Sansotei/Kinton/Santouka.   I'd come back when in the area and didn't want to wait for my meal."}
{"text":"What garbage. Noodles were unedible, $1 instant noodles would have tasted better. Service was terrible too, they were all so incompetent. Worst ramen place in the city that I've been to so far, stay clear of this disgusting place."}
{"text":"Love the noodles, broth is de-LISH, and the option of getting extra toppings to fill your bowl to the rim. Get a small size of noodles to enjoy a few side dishes. The gyoza skin is delicate and light and Char -su is super tender!"}
{"text":"Tops. Excellent broth, Gyoza is good.  Friendly and attentive service. A pint of Sapporo is reasonable.  There's space in there, so you're not crammed in."}
{"text":"First thing first.  This place is beautifully renovated.  Easily the most modern and classy ambience of all the popular Toronto Ramen-ya.  In the blink of an eye, you can easily imagine you are at a fine dining spot in L.A. or New York.   Interior reminds me of Ipuddo East Village. This is in total contrast of the previous BBQ property, which was worse than a dump.   Once they have the liquor license, it can become a hot hangout.  Next, the food.  Tonkotsu Shio is what I ordered.  Comparing to Santouka, which managed to burn my tongue with their \"soft launch Tonkotsu Shio\", the bowl was served at a perfectly comfortable \"hot\" temperature.  The broth is creamy white, somewhere between the obviously powder-mixed soup of Ajisen and the smooth simmered broth of Sansotei.   The noodle is the most \"Instant Nissin/Top Ramen like\" of all the current Ramen-ya.  If you miss the good old instant ramen college days, this noodle will satisfy.  Of course, it is a much more substantial egg noodle, with a very nice texture - not soft and soggy.  Along with a piece of Pork Shoulder Char-sui, you also get some black fugus (wood ear), half of a poached egg, and cabbage (didn't care for this, but it is a good filler), pile of chopped scallion,  and a dash of special flavour oil.  The oil creates a kind of interesting \"slick\" against the paper-white broth as you dig into the bowl; interesting but not too pretty.   Overall, the Char-sui is no match for either Sansotei or Santouka, but not as dry and stuck-between-your-teeth as Kinton's.  The ramen noodle is good, but definitely a grade below those at Sansotei and Santouka.  The broth was, together with the \"flavor oil slick\", very filling.   Unfortunately, it really lacked any pork bone/fish/seaweed taste, but it fills you.    In fact, I cannot get myself to finish the broth - and looking around, it appears to be a very common problem.   You do, however, get the illusion that it is great value - because you are definitely filled by the time you finished the noodle.   All toppings, including the half poached egg, are bland tasting - and added mainly for color and texture.    Pricing is very reasonable with respect to others in the city.  Bowls of ramen are all 9 dollars and change, and 5 Goyza can be had for an additional 2.50.  They are staffed to the hilt, probably for grand opening training.   But there were more staff there than customers during my visit.  The location and ambience are five stars for Raijin; Food is more than acceptable.  And I really hope it stays around for a long time.  But in the mean time, as long as the weather is not too cold - I am more likely to be found at the lineups of Sansotei or Santouka."}
{"text":"Went there today. The place is large and service is fast. But the taste of it's ramen is just so so and the pork belly is pretty tough. You can get better ramen in others places for same price"}
{"text":"Nothing really special about the ramen here, but maybe that \"humbleness\" is what I like about this place. There's a lot of space so wouldn't have to wait out side like at other ramen shops. My reco is the chicken based soup."}
{"text":"Best ramen joint in TO! Been to all other places but Raijin Ramen is my fave. Soup base is brothy and full of taste. Service is super friendly and attentitive."}
{"text":"I've filled out 2 loyalty cards already here lol  I'm serious... But I do live across the street. The spicy ramen is my go to, if I'm extra hungry I will add the teriyaki poutine. The fried chicken is solid here as well as an app.   The waitresses are super sweet and food comes really quick.   I don't have much experience with other ramen places, but this place doesn't give me any reason to look else where."}
{"text":"This is 3.5/5 for ramen.  The selection is quite nice. You can pick your broth, add extra meats for more $$. Some ramen has egg, some don't. You can combo with salad, other sides, and dessert or beverage to maximize your experience.  I got their 'Miso Chasu Ramen' w/ extra noodle ($1 extra) and extra chasu ($3 extra). The broth is a bit better than average i'd say. The noodle was cooked nicely. Mine did not come with egg, so a lil cheesed. The chasu (pork belly) was nice. I'd say it was one of the better ones I've had at ramen joints. The service was alright. They have quite a few tv to enjoy the games.  They have a nice beer pitcher deal, and lunch box deal if ppl are interested in that.  Would consider coming back if around area."}
{"text":"Came here after a Raptors game because it was the only one still open and we were craving ramen. The interior was quaint with decent decor. The ramen (broth) was too salty and portion was too small. Service was a bit lacking as we had to ask for water a few times before getting it (restaurant wasn't busy either)."}
{"text":"I was just telling a friend, the only reason I'm not finishing my food is because I don't like it. I know wasting was not good, but I just didn't want to keep eating that whatever ramen I had, I was so hungry, but I left 2/3 of it, last time it happened was almost 3 years ago, with ordinary noodles, I terminate them with no soup left. At Raijin, the topping was good, nice quantity, and the taste was ok.  But god it was oily and saaaaaaaaalty. Do you guys get your salt for free? save it for other customers please. so the only two reasons I will prob go back are the toppings(but they are only good at ordinary level) , and I live freakishly close."}
{"text":"Love the ramen special! Had it a few weeks back and plan to come back for some more! The atmosphere is great and the service was excellent. Thanks again and hope to come back soon"}
{"text":"I had a chance to try the restaurant last night.  The place is very nicely renovated and it's much more spacious than it appears out from.  Much better compared to Kinton on Baldwin for breathing space.    Service was prompt and courteous and ramen came out quickly.  We had 4 people and I order the chicken broth while another in my group ordered the pork bone broth.  I tried the pork broth but found it a bit heavy.  Preferred the chicken broth.  Lighter tasting and thinner.  The chicken broth bowls use a thinner ramen than the pork bone soup ones.  Broth was fine for both although bit salty but I think that's common for all ramen places in general.  You are able to ask to reduce sodium for the soup so you just have to ask.  Water was replenished often without being asked or disruptive.  I would come back again to see how consistent the food is but overall impression is quite positive.    There are a lot of ramen places now so they really have to keep on their toes.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"The only place I've ever had veggie ramen in Canada is Motomachi Shokudo in Vancouver, so when Raijin opened in Toronto, I was excited to see if it had, and it does! I'm not vegetarian but I fell in love with the vegetable ramen when I tried it in NYC at Totto Ramen, a more lighter and healthier version if I don't feel like a heavy broth and eating meat. The broth here is claimed to be vegetable based using mushrooms, lotus root, kelp other veggies. The toppings had a large variety: tomato, okra, carrot, radish, deep-fried pumpkin, lotus root and yam! I added a side of boiled egg for protein and it was just the right texture. The broth itself could be a less salty, but overall I will say I would order it again: 4/5. I wish there were more vegetables like Motomachi. I would even suggest adding corn, avocado, fungus and a strip of nori for the price, but one can't complain too much!  We also ordered the Kara-age and it was very well made. The chicken was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. We ordered a small (3 pcs) but definitely getting the large next time! 5/5.  The service was quite poor. We were sitting for 5 minutes without someone taking our order, then forgetting to serve us water (and severs would be wiping empty tables instead even when no one was waiting to be seated), and then not giving us utensils when the appetizer came out (at this point I would think the waitress would catch on that we need something to eat with considering she dropped it off on an empty table - no napkin, no utensil, no plate, no drink...ugh, what are we gonna eat with? I could eat with my hands but...) anyway, later the waiter realized and apologized and left us feeling at least acknowledged by the end of the night! Service: 2/5.  We also ordered the coffee jelly on milk pudding dessert sprinkled with matcha powder, and it was good, 4/5.  All in all, I would return, I just hope the service was a one-off and that we came on a bad night so I will update upon my next return. Would be back for the veggie ramen!"}
{"text":"High recommend! This restaurant franchise came from Japan to Vancouver and now to Toronto. You can get free topping for checking in on fb.   Noodles are excellent and as are the various toppings. This is our go to place for whenever we feel like ramen noodles.   Get a large with extra noodles if your hungry.   Pros -good service -excellent quality -$ -stamp loyalty card  Cons -seating may be limited."}
{"text":"Tasty, with both novel and classic Ramen choices. Perfectly al dente noodles, and a surprisingly rich broth, even for the miso soup which I had. Appetizers were good bang for your buck. Quick and smooth service."}
{"text":"Best noodle in the town, very fast service and sympathetic crew especially Memo :3 Yani arkada?lar gelip de yememezlik yapmay?n, efsane. En iyi Uzakdo?u mutfa?? net."}
{"text":"Decided to finally write a review after coming here regularly with my husband.   We're both from Vancouver and love our ramen there (Motomachi Shokudo (the cold ramen!) being my favourite, followed by Santouka's delicious warm broths). Kintaro, which is associated with Raijin, is ok there. I like Raijin more here.  The restaurant is big! I've never seen them use the inside room, but the front is big enough that there's not much of a wait. Although, if given a choice, pick the tables instead of the bar - the bar chairs are very uncomfortable!  Food-wise - the ramen is consistent. I like the tori-paitan shio. It has a good flavour and chicken is moist and delicious. I've had the cold ramen before too, and although it's one of my favourite preparations for summer time, Raijin's is not the best I've had. If you do try it, leave a bit in the end and ask them to pour hot soup in it - a warm and different way to end your meal.   My husband usually likes the pork ramen - and that's tasty too. We've never had the charcoal broth, but I don't feel like it'll be worth the price.  I've recently tried the appetizers and I love the poutine du japon. It was fun. The gyoza (I had a small - 5 pieces) was good too - freshly pan fried! I'm thinking it's house-made, which makes it even better.   The chicken karaage was good too.   We also usually order the salad - my husband likes it, but I don't like the seasoning - it throws me off. But I do like the corn in it.   Oh, and if you want a bit of extra something, I recommend the hanpa cha-siu - it's only a buck and worth it. :)  Raijin is good & consistent. I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"So tasty!  The gyoza is to die for. Apparently when they have a full menu there will be vegetarian options, but I went last week and it was not on there yet - that's my only reason for 4 stars. I will go back for sure, it's so close to me and the soup is delicious! Oh and the green tea is very matcha-y, I loved it."}
{"text":"I love their fried chicken! Sooooooo damn good. And their also have their pitchers of Sapporo on sale, only 10 bucks. The ramen.... emmm, actually I can't tell the difference among theirs, Santosei's, and Hokkaido's. But I will definitely go back to Raijin, the chicken and the beer are tempting enough."}
{"text":"This is one of the more spacious ramen restaurant that I've been to in downtown Toronto.  However, the ramen is not as good as the other places that I've tried, i.e. Kinton, Santouka, Sansotei.  We decided to come here since we were dining with a big group with kids.  We figured that this is the only ramen place that we can get a table for a big group without lining up (plus can accommodate strollers).  I have ordered & tried the following so far:  - Tonkotsu Shio  Ramen - I find the broth too creamy; I'm not a big fan of creamy dishes so maybe that is why I do not like it very much - Kakuni Pork Bun - I've tasted better pork buns in other places; will not order this again if I am ever back here - Gyoza - Not bad, but nothing special about it either.    The fact that it is spacious is a bonus when dining with a bigger group or if you are bringing along infants/ children.  We tried to call ahead to make a reservation but they said that they do not take reservations. We just arrived early to avoid any line ups. (With the huge space they have, I doubt that there are any line ups here.)  Will probably be back but it is not our top choice for ramen place in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Been to this place once, both noodle and soup base on are \"ok\", not the best comparing to Kinton and Sansotei.  The pork is a little too dry and not tendered at all, egg is OK but not the best again.  However I love the fact that they have more different soup base that you can choose, something that is different from a traditional ramen place which offers mainly sea salt, miso and shoyu which are all based on pork bone soupbase.  Note that their deep fried chicken is very very juicy and tender which worth a try~~"}
{"text":"Ramen was alright. Chicken karaage not good. But reason for one star is the terrible service and how it was handled. Found a hair in my tea and notified the server. Waitress said it was from myself and gave me attitude. Um ok?!? Reluctantly took it away and brought back a \"fresh\" cup. Flustered she also forgot some of orders. Disappointing experience won't be back."}
{"text":"It's 3.5. (This is my overall score from the 6-7 times I've been here)  I have been here quite a few times and it's an above average ramen place.  I had the cold yuzu shio ramen($10.95) recently and it was delicious.  Great chewy noodles.  Great cold broth strong yuzu taste.  Love the 2 slices of yuzu.  The chicken char-shu was okay. Egg was okay.  Rating: 4/5   Great place for ramen if you are around the area."}
{"text":"the food and place are decent, but I AM EXTREMEMY UPSET ABOUT THE SERVICE. Is it that difficult to find waitresses who speak proper english?! If you want to hire japanese waitresses I'm totally fine with that, BUT AT LEAST MAKE SURE THEY SPEAK ENGLISH!!! I cant explain how difficult it is to order something, especially over the phone. I am disgusted and fed up with trying to tell these people what I mean by spicy chashu don WITHOUT A COMBO and then order another ramen. How did these japanese people even get here without passing some sort of language exam?"}
{"text":"Best ramen place. You must try their japanese poutine it is heaven! There takoyaki also delicious."}
{"text":"We decided to come here on a Saturday night after trying another ramen joint where the line was out the door and around the restaurant. At Raijin, we still had to wait but it was only ~15 min if you were okay with \"sharing a table\" - it was a long table with chairs on one side so basically felt like sitting at the bar.  Ordered the miso ramen and the spicy ramen, both with egg. The food was slow to arrive and we were starving by the time it came...but to be fair the restaurant was fully packed. Can't say it's the best ramen I've tried in Toronto but it was still very delicious and definitely beats waiting in the cold for 1hr+ to grab some food!"}
{"text":"I recently came here for dinner with a group of my friends hoping to satisfy our ramen craving. I've heard good things about this place from some friends so I had relatively high expectations. Spoiler: it didn't end well for any of us.   Service was great -- we made reservations for 6 pm and we were seated immediately when we arrived. The menu is more extensive than most other ramen places I've been to so that was a nice surprise. The bulk of our party opted for the ramen combo that comes with a small ramen of choice, rice bowl, and salad. I ordered the shoyu ramen and chicken rice. I thought the portion size was fair for the price that you're paying. I can definitely see how some people might find it to be smaller than average but you get what you pay for. The ramen broth was okay -- I felt like it wasn't quite salty enough and fell a little flat. Was it creamy? Sure, but the flavour was lacking. The noodle consistency and texture was decent but I personally prefer the noodles at Sansotei. The rice was really disappointing mainly because the chicken was bland. Honestly, the highlight of my meal was the salad. I normally don't like to eat salad but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The vinaigrette they used was out of this world.    Okay, now flash forward to 3 am when I realized that I was starting to get a stomach ache. It progressed into diarrhea throughout the whole night until midday the next day. I didn't think much of it until I started talking to my friends and we realized that all five of us had diarrhea. The only thing that we had all eaten the same of was the salad and the ramen (the noodle, not the broth). Irony is so cruel. Why the only thing I enjoyed might have been the thing that given me diarrhea is beyond me.   Long story short, I probably won't be returning here again based on this experience. That being said, my visit might have just been a fluke. Had it not happened I would've given this place a 2/5. The food nothing spectacular but the price point is good."}
{"text":"They're the cheapest of the ramen stores in downtown. They're filling. My place to go for my belly to be filled. Consistant quality each time I've been."}
{"text":"I've been to almost all the ramen restaurants in Toronto (Santouka, Sansotei, Isshin to name a few) and Raijin is the one I consistently go back to. I can't say I know how the rest of the menu fares cause I'm exploding after my usual bowl of the tonkotsu spicy miso ramen.   I think the portion size at Raijin is pretty reasonable for it's price compared to some other ramen joints I've visited. I feel like they offer more toppings in each bowl compared to the other joints where you have to pay for each additional topping. If you're a fan of spice and the blend of toppings (esp. corn) I'd say give Raijin a try. I've been visiting Raijin for the last five years on and off and they have been pretty consistent every time I've visited. They've also expanded their menu and added many items/options as well.  Service here is the same as any standard Japanese owned ramen joint, not much to expect, it is a food where you eat and go."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend, who had been meaning to go since seeing the signs that Raijin was opening soon. The menu is short and simple, with an option for either pork or chicken-based broth, and all other regular ingredients you'd expect in a ramen bowl (noodles, nori, soft boiled egg etc). My boyfriend had the pork broth, I thought I'd try the chicken broth expecting a light alternative. The chicken broth was light as intended, the broth was clear and definitely less fatty than the pork broth. The fishiness of the base is more obvious within the chicken broth, which I didn't particularly like. The pork broth was tasty but a bit on the salty side. The noodles had a slight instant noodle texture to me, but my boyfriend disagreed.  The service was fantastic, we were in and out (voluntarily) very quickly, and the noodles came within minutes of being ordered. The restaurant has a more spacious feel than other noodle bars I've been to in the city. Overall, it's a reasonable meal that will do in a pinch. I still prefer my regular ramen joint for the same price, but Raijin will definitely meet the craving and without the queue."}
{"text":"I generally find ramen a little bland for my taste but the spicy tonkotsu has all of the flavours and just hits the spot. The portions are also more generous than a lot of the other ramen places.  The place is always packed with all the Ryerson students and people that work nearby but easy to snag a table if you're a lone diner . Hate the service though . Inattentive and slow."}
{"text":"This place opens at 5:30pm sharp for dinner. My friend and I got there at 5:25 and everyone was waiting inside while the hostess informed everyone to wait a few minutes.  Service is friendly and fast. I ordered Shio with less salt. The soup contained some kind of black speckles that I thought was soy, but the waitress kindly informed my friend and I that it was a type of garlic oil. It made the broth look interesting. The taste was pretty good, though perhaps next time I'll refrain from asking for less salt.  The pork shoulder butt (that's what it says on the menu... \"butt\") wasn't exactly tender. It was fairly thick, and I wound up using my hands to tear off chuncks that my teeth couldn't rip because, even with my \"superior\" skills with chopsticks were no match for that meat.  The veggies weren't that great. I think there was cabbage or something, but I noticed that they used Chinese Broccoli (Kai-Lan) too. Not a fan of that.   But at least the noodles were pretty good. My serving wasn't too hard or too soft, but it was a good texture. Great for slurping and making a mess, just as ramen should be.  The overall experience was good, but personally, I preferred the soup of Sansotei and maybe the noodles of Santouka. That shouldn't deter you from trying it out though. It has a nice and spacious interior, which means there is no need to wait outside in lines (compared to Sansotei and Santouka, which are comparatively smaller in size, and Kinton, where I waited over 90 minutes at, outside, during a blazing hot summer day), and when it's a cold winter night and you're craving for some hot ramen noodles, the last thing you want to be doing is waiting outside in the freezing snow. Even if you have to wait for seating, at least this place has an inside waiting area!"}
{"text":"Raijin is my second favourite Ramen restaurant in Toronto...oh it's so hard to decide I do love Santouka but I do adore Raijin's Iekei Ramen which is only available in limited quantities each day.   The pork practically turns to butter in your mouth as you chew it.  The Iekei Ramen is served with garlic, ginger, chilli bean sauce, vinegar and white pepper on the side with the Chef's recommendation of how much of each ingredient to add to the Ramen. It's enjoyable to eat it at first without any of these sides and then slowly add them to see how much the flavour develops in complexity.  Included for free by request is steamed rice, perfect for soaking up every last drop of this amazing broth."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for ramen. I love how creamy the broth is and the noodles are delicious! I've had ramen in Japan and I can definitely say that this place is comparable. They did recently change their menu, which was a bit disappointing for me, but overall the new items on their menu is still good."}
{"text":"This place had wonderful, attentive, and friendly service. The spicy tonkatsu ramen was delicious, with a creamy and well spiced broth, yummy noodles, and a PERFECT boiled egg (1.50$ extra). They gave me a large portion instead of the small I asked for, and they kindly charged for a small. The vibe here is comforting, spacious, and not too loud. The takoyaki is tasty, definitely above average!  They also have a small shop in the den of the restaurant with bento, onigiri (both 20% off for students!), snacks like pocky and mochi ice-cream and other desserts, plus ramune to drink!   This restaurant is wheelchair accessible with no step and plenty of room inside to navigate, but has no automatic button."}
{"text":"On this a very cold day visiting Downtown Toronto, and having just gotten over a cold, I was looking for something easy, satisfying, and warm.  Raijin delivers on all counts.  I'm no expert in Ramen, but I know when I see, smell, and taste things that I like.  Raijin's open kitchen lets everyone see how complicated something as simple as their dishes can be.  They have a very thorough menu with something for most everyone.  Pork belly and pork shoulder can always satisfy the hungriest stomach, in any of a variety of broth and soup choices I really think you can't go wrong.    Their small combo comes with a nice ramen bowl, a fresh salad with a very pleasant contrast to the hot savory soup, and even a choice of a small rice bowl too!  Pretty good bang for the buck.    The Chocolate cake-like dessert was the only thing I tried that was a bit disappointing.  Personally I find Japanese desserts to be a bit hit or miss anyway, and this won't deter me from going back to Raijin Ramen again."}
{"text":"Was shopping by myself in the area and decided to try this place.   I chose the Black charcoal dark miso ramen, which has a chicken broth infused with a black charcoal oil for an interesting flavour. Noodles were delicious, slightly firm and cooked perfectly, and the pork was very tender but not overwhelmingly fatty.  The atmosphere was great for a single patron - busy and lively, but not overcrowded. Still, like most ramen places it's probably a nice place to have lunch or bring a casual date, but not somewhere to linger for hours. I actually prefer the vibe here to Sansotei and Santouka, where I felt the pressure to eat and leave as quickly as a could.   I would definitely come back here to try some more of the menu, which is quite extensive for a ramen place. Also tried the Tako-Wasabi, which was quite nice, but could have used more octopus. For Japanophiles, they have a cute Anpan-man lunch special (for kids, but who's to judge.)"}
{"text":"My friend and I originally planned to go to Santouka that is only a few blocks away, but the line up for Santouka at 11:30am had us heading to Raijin. The decor was gorgeous, clean, comfortable, and modern. The waiting staff stood around, as there was only one other table at the time. We were greeted by the entire staff, like they do in Guu, and seated immediately.  The service was amazing, very attentive, possibly because they weren't busy. They're definitely ready for when it does get busy.  The ramen arrived at our table quickly and it looked amazing. We both ordered the Tonkotsu Shoyu, it had half an egg, nori seaweed, bean sprouts, scallions, and char-sui. The soup-base was creamier than I'm used to, it was good for the first few sips, but after a while seemed to lack something (different layers of flavour maybe?). I liked that the soup-base wasn't overly salty, but sadly the char-sui was way too salty.   The noodles were cooked to the perfect texture, not too starchy or soggy. The bowl seemed pretty big, it was very filling, and worth the 9.50.  I like it more than Kinton, but I prefer Sansotei. I'll have to try Santouka another day. I would likely come back if I want something good and filling, but mostly for the service and the short line up."}
{"text":"Raijin's ramen is the worst ramen I have ever had in Toronto. This time I ordered the pork soup ramen and compared to other ramen restaurant in Toronto, Rajin's pork based soup lacked an distinctive flavour that you would expect from a authentic pork ramen. It is also the most expensive ramen compare to the other restaurants in Toronto. In Raijin, a small bowl ramen with egg cost me 17 dollars, where as in Sansotei ramen With an extra meat and a side dish it only cost me 14 in total. Raijin by far is the worst Japanese ramen in Toronto because of their tasteless flavour and high cost. I strongly don't recommended their ramen."}
{"text":"3rd time back. There are more things on the menu. The egg is still the best part of the ramen. If you like milky broth, this is the place.   Family and big group friendly! And no need to wait!"}
{"text":"I have returned to Raijin a few times and they have been good, broth were flavorful and has body, noodles were not soggy , the pork was tender and the eggs are nicely cooked.   However tonight the ramen is a 2/5 stars (being generous) because the broth was superrrrr oily yet bland. I was hungry yet struggled to finish it because there was almost an inch of oil floating on top my ramen.   For the record I always order the Shio Tonkasu ramen, the 2nd one the list with the blacken garlic oil. Also there was practically no blackened garlic oil in my ramen today, only this yellowy brown oil. Really disappointing since a nice bowl of ramen was perfect for the rainy cold night tonight, but it was bordering on very gross. My husband who isn't very picky with food agrees, he was struggling to finish his bowl too due to the extreme oiliness.  Overall, I was previously baffled by the lowish rating on yelp with this place but after tonight I understand. Since 3 out of 4 times the ramen was good, and the service is always prompt and polite I will still give them a 3/5 overall. I hope tonight was a fluke that the ramen was so bad."}
{"text":"There is an ongoing debate in our household regarding who makes the best ramen in town.  While it doesn't quite make it to the top of my list (more on that later), my wife believes Raijin Ramen is the best.  So, here are my thoughts....  Raijin Ramen is tucked in behind a condo building.  You won't see it from the main street (Wellesley) as you need to traverse down a small laneway and take a short turn to the left before you the encounter the restaurant.  Once inside, you will find the restaurant to be a small but inviting space.  There are a mix of communal and individual tables and overall the place feels quite comfortable.  The service was pleasant and friendly.  The servers also seems knowledgable about the menu.  The ramen at Raijin is indeed very good.  We typically get the Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen and the Shio Tonkotsu Ramen.  In my opinion, Raijin Ramen does have the best noodles.  They are firm and \"springy\" or bouncy with excellent flavour.  The pork leans towards the lean side and the portion is quite generous.  We will also typically order the seasoned soft boiled egg which is also excellent and once again, Raijin makes one of the best soft boiled eggs produced by a ramen restaurant.  Arguably, the most vital part of ramen is the broth and this is where Raijin loses a point for me, but I admit, this is really all just a matter of personal preference or opinion.  While the broth at Raijin Ramen is always quite flavourful with good umami, I find it to be a little too rich.  The broth is opaque and creamy and it is very apparent that many hours were taken to make the broth, but I find it to be just a little heavy and rich.  It has that sticky, lip-smacking quality that you would expect from any good ramen broth.  In the end, as I mentioned previously, it really is a matter of opinion or preference as my wife loves this broth, however, I prefer my ramen broth just a touch lighter.  We also had the Kara-Age, and well, who doesn't like fried chicken?  It came out hot and crispy.  The chicken itself was also quite juicy and flavourful.  Overall, it was very good.  As I mentioned, my wife believes Raijin Ramen makes the best ramen in town, and if you haven't tried it yet, I would highly recommend it.  I agree that the ramen here is excellent, however it doesn't quite top my list for best ramen (indeed, it places a very close second for me).  At the top of my list would be Kinton Ramen, as for my tastes, I prefer the broth just slightly more at Kinton.  What is your favourite ramen restaurant?"}
{"text":"the fried chicken was great.  asahi on tap was nice and refreshing. i ordered their special-- Bamboo-charcoal dark miso ramen.  The portion is good.  The meat and the noodle was average.  the half boiled egg was perfect.  but the broth was just dead salty, which made the whole dish hard to eat.   i tried my husband's ramen which is Shio Tokotsu with additional toppings.  his broth was more flavourful but still really salty.  the pork belly was tender.   we agreed that if a person was to finish all the broth, he/she will be like a pickled person... when i was in japan i didn't remember the broth being so salty.  so i wish they had cut down on the salt for the broth. good services and no need to wait."}
{"text":"On Christmas Eve, we settled for Raijin Ramen since it was practically the only restaurant open. I remember seeing a review from BlogTO but didn't read much into it. Without much expectation, I ended up enjoying my experience at Raijin.  At 7ish, there was no one waiting for seats. The staff were nice and friendly - we were greeted and seated with free smiles which lasted the whole night :) By 8:30, more people came into the restaurant.   I ordered the Shio Ramen. Unlike Kinton, you don't get to choose how heavy your soup base was, but they made it just right. It's much lighter than Kinton's soup. The black oil they added gave the ramen an unusual charcoal taste which I quickly grew to enjoy. The portions are fitting for a small girl like myself.  We also ordered the fried chicken which was just average. There were 2 pieces served on a small plate (with a piece of lemon). The skin was kind of crispy, but that's about it.   For a ramen spot, the price is also average. Ordering 2 ramens and a dish of fried chicken came to approximately $30. I would definitely come back to try the other ramens.  Tip: Don't be fooled by the small seating area you see from the windows.. there's a 2nd level below!"}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant under construction a while ago and kept a mental note. I saw they were open for business and convinced a friend to go with me. Purely by chance, it happened to be their first day of business as well! They don't serve alcohol yet, but currently applying for a license. It is operated by Japanese kitchen staff and wait staff, if you were wondering. They will greet you in a manner similar to Guu.  The decor is beautiful inside. It's very well decorated and has lots of natural light. It is very spacious and not cramped like several other ramen restaurants in Toronto.  Unfortunately for vegetarians, they have no veg options available. Only options were chicken and pork in their respective broths. You can order without meat though.  We ordered 2 tonkatsu shoyu ramen, with one without meat, as I am a vegetarian. The price is slightly higher than its competitors, such as Kenzo Ramen, but I think its worth the money. Some places offer tea for free, here it is extra.  Service was quick. Portions were bigger, noodles chewier, with a bigger piece of nori, plenty of fresh bean sprouts, and half of a soft boiled egg that was absolutely fantastic.  The broth was rich and delicious, although I found it to be too heavy for my liking. Usually I will finish the ramen broth, but I couldn't this time. if it was slightly lighter, it would be perfect.  The location used to be several failed eateries. When I was still a student at ryerson, it had gone through 2 incarnations already. I hope they will be around for a long time."}
{"text":"I ordered the tonkotsu shio ramen in chicken broth. Nothing extra added to first get their basic ramen experience.   Soup base was very clean and light flavoured in terms or saltiness, which I love. Toppings included a soft boiled egg that was made in soya sauce (a touch of authenticity since most places don't have their eggs made in soya sauce). A little bit of green. Literally two of them. Lots of green onion which is a personal favourite of mine for ramen because it complements perfectly for lighter broths, adding that extra freshness kick to the broth. Last but not least, the pork was soft and I didn't have to worry about any of it getting stuck in my teeth. Definitely better than Kinton's pork!   Now, the noodles were of medium texture. That is to say, it wasn't soggy yet not chewy.   I would have rated their chicken broth ramen 5/5 if it weren't for my personal preference of more greens (only two leafs didn't fully satisfy me). I will be back to try their add-ons.   Now to atmosphere and decor, I love how spacious it is and my friend kept pointing out the staff's higher than other ramen shops' class. As in, Raijin has a higher class Japanese service than all the other ramen places, Momofuku included! This is all up to preference of which kind of atmosphere you would like. I think this is what will distinguish them the most apart from their fresher, lighter noodle broths.   Decor was simple and could have used a little bit more thought. I guess the decor is too simple giving a more bland flavour to the place and harder to notice the more sophisticated service they are trying to aim for.   I will be back for sure though. Maybe I can even hope they will open another one closer to the great restaurant area of Spadina and Bloor!"}
{"text":"Great costumer service, very welcoming from the minute you enter the restaurant to when you leave. Ramen was yummy, we also had a side of fried chicken which was especially tasty with the dip on the side. But the best part by far was the strawberry eclair for dessert! Not sure if that's just on the Valentine's Day special menu but it was DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I was eager to try this place and went for lunch. The menu was average, and I was excited to try their garlic miso Ramen. However, after waiting for awhile for my order to be taken, I called over a fellow staff member who looked like she was the manager.   I asked her if I could place an order with her, she said to wait and rushed away. The restaurant had maybe like 3 or 4 other tables busy with clients. The woman I asked earlier for help busied herself reorganizing receipts and the other staff members ignored our table. We weren't offered any water as we waited as we saw other tables been refilled with water. We felt ignored and unwelcome. No one came to our table. We left hungry and disappointed with the experience."}
{"text":"So I've been here 3 times now. All because Santouka's line is way too long and I'm way too lazy. lol.  I've tried (both from mine and friend's) everything on their menu. The miso base is the best. Their noodles are good, pork is as tender as other places, and the boiled egg needs a lot more work. The shio and shoyu were both too salty. The spicy miso is not spicy enough. And I can't ask for extra spice.   Their apps are great. The kirage, gyoza and poutine were all excellent. Again, I would come here just because there's no line. But it is not the best ramen place downtown. If you have the time and patience, go to (in this order) Santouka, Sansotei, or Kinton before stepping in here. However, they do provide big portions for its price."}
{"text":"I love their ramen and side dishes. Ramen isn't that special compared to most other ramen places in toronto, but their combo dishes are amazing (rice)! I love their chicken+mayo or soboro-don!"}
{"text":"Service: - difficult to call a waiter/waitress for food orders - there were a lot of empty seatings at the back of the restaurant, but it appears that they enjoy putting all of the customers at the front   Food: - ordered Tonkotsu Miso and it was extremely salty  Overall: - excellent accessibility for wheelchairs, strollers, etc. into the restaurant - clean and spacious - although I find the washrooms to be freezing compared to the rest of the restaurant - expensive in a long run even if they give you a student discount punch for each time that you come in"}
{"text":"One of my favourite ramen places in downtown Toronto. Another thing about it is it has a big space so I don't have to line up and can come with a big group of friends."}
{"text":"Best ramen I've had in Toronto. The broth is FANTASTIC. This is my go to place in the neighbourhood, I'd eat it everyday if I could. I love the way they greet you when you arrive and leave the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the hottest place in Toronto  for Ramen"}
{"text":"Tired, cranky, a sock wet and hungry I went out for a walk to see what food was around.  I wasn't sure what I wanted but I was thinking some comfort food and came across this Raijin.  The place looked busy and also looked nice so I decided to drop in.  The hostess sat me by the kitchen by the bench seating.  I had a chance to talk to some of the cooks and had a look over the menu.  Looking around the place I thought it was very nicely decorated.  I heard nothing but Japanese around me which was very cool as that's not always the case in other cities when you're at Japanese restaurants.  I ended up ordering a bowl of ramen with the basics and some fried chicken.  I looked around some more and the place was over 3/4 full and it was close to 11pm mid week.  The fried chicken was solid.  It was slightly dry but wasn't oily which is the worst thing with fried chicken.  I'm pretty sure I could eat a whole fried chicken from here.  The ramen wasn't bad at all.  I found the broth slightly rich but besides that the rest of the bowl was delicious!  With some delicious ramen in TO, it might take me some time before I'm back but I wouldn't turn it down the next time my socks are soaked and I want to get some food in ma belly."}
{"text":"I come here all the time. Takoyaki balls are bomb. We ordered like 5 plates of those.  You get seated right away and the food comes in no time.   Also, how considerate of them to put mouthwash in the bathrooms!"}
{"text":"Went there on friday,  location should be the best one for now i have been to many others. Very convenient at yonge and a quiet corner on gerrard.  The whole shop's environment and atmosphere providing you a comfort mood. Its different from traditional japanese tiny ramen shops' style, they have large capacity with also a drinking bar and snack kiosk,  also an iconic raijin sculpture where interrior impressed me. All staff behaving a strong team spirit for greeting as well and both nice.  For food,  i will say the noodle is a bit hard and dried.  Soup is oily but ok for me, but not rich, layers are simple. Topping are jus nice, the whole bowl was not really impressed me but is ok so far.    Sometime we eat the mood rather than the food, will b back soon."}
{"text":"They mixed up our order, but otherwise, service was good.  Ramen was very good and since I don't normally eat particularly salty foods, I was very happy that it was the right level of saltiness. You get a really big piece of pork too. Only wish that the nori was shredded instead of one big piece. Big fan and would definitely go again."}
{"text":"We came on a rainy Friday night. Less then 10 min wait. Spicy miso ramen hit the spot. The broth wasn't too spicy or thick and the noodles were perfectly cooked.  Would definitely come back. Yum!!"}
{"text":"4.5/5 stars.   Came here for the first time after watching a TIFF movie with my boyfriend. It was about a 5 minute walk from Ryerson Theatre, and a completely spontaneous try. My boyfriend wasn't in the mood for ramen but compromised as he wasn't as hungry as I was. When we got there, they initially turned us away stating they were just about to close, but then called us back saying they'd happily serve us as their last customer. Very nice :)   I got the special combo with pork broth and pulled pork on rice. It also came with a small side salad. My boyfriend opted for the small spicy pork ramen (which was a great portion).   Both our orders came out relatively quickly and we dug in. My boyfriend immediately exclaimed that he loved it! I, too, loved my dish and it was an incredibly large portion for the price. We enjoyed every bite and left nothing on our plates/bowls.   Needless to say, it completely hit the spot. Price was right, place was clean, service was friendly, and the food really tasty and of good value (they didn't skimp on the meat, and even the salad was delicious). Oh and bonus point - really great interior look.   My boyfriend left happily expressing that this was a great decision - and he wasn't even in the mood for ramen/that hungry initially. We would definitely return and recommend!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this ramen shop when looking for a place to dine in for dinner and was pleasantly surprised! I'm usual not a big fan of ramen but out of the few ramen places I've been to this is my favourite.   Service was really good. The waiters were kind and attentive throughout our whole meal. Seating was comfortable and we got a table for five within a few minutes. They sometimes yell out \"welcome\" and etc (I'm assuming) in Japanese (also assuming) like they do at Guu Izakaya. Overall it felt very welcoming.   Prices were fair (can be found on their site). I got the tonkotsu tsuke-men with the cold noodles. The best part was the egg!! We loved the egg so much we got an extra order at the end. The soup/dipping sauce was really salty so make sure you dip your noodles in them and don't slurp it as a soup like I did in the beginning. My friend got a regular tonkotsu spicy ramen and it wasn't spicy at all but the soup was amazingly creamy. Two others ordered the tonkotsu miso ramen. Personally this was my favourite soup base out of all the ramen orders we had, it had just enough flavour and wasn't overwhelming or too salty. Lastly, we also ordered the tonkotsu shoyu. Unfortunately I didn't get a taste of this but the person who ordered it seemed to like it a lot!"}
{"text":"The fish stock ramen is delicious. A little bite over price. But the ramen is so good. Who care the price."}
{"text":"Firstly the service was impeccable especially for an Asian resto. They were friendly and efficient - the two things I look for in wait staff. Ramen was good. I had the pork miso dish with gyoza. Both were very good although the gyoza was very salty tasting. Could definitely use a reduction in sodium.   The Good:  1. Staff. Very friendly and fast.  2. Ramen. It was a very good dish and I will definitely order it again.   The Bad:  1. Sodium. The sodium content on this stuff is out of this world.  2. Menu. Very small selection.  Recommendation: Take my review with a grain of salt ;) - this was my first ramen experience!"}
{"text":"I've been to it's other location on Gerard a couple times and really love the ramen here.  I'm a ramen snob - so my standards are quite high when it comes to this type of food.  I always get the tonkatsu ramen with the egg.  It's extremely flavourful and the pork is very tender every time.  I have a big appetite, so my only complaint is that the portions are a bit small even after you upsize with the extra noodles.  It's also a bit on the pricey side - but hey, everything is about this price level when you eat in the downtown core.  Staff are super friendly and helpful, and they give you shoutouts when you come and go to welcome and thank you.    I always come here for lunch, and bring my friends here all the time.   I like it here more than the other options nearby (Sansotei or Kenzo), although my fave dt ramen spot is still Isshin (YUMMM!!).  Would def recommend!! :)"}
{"text":"I went to Raijin with a friend upon her recommendations.  I had the miso ramen; large portion, good noodle texture, the soup was pretty average. Restaurant had a nice atmosphere, the service was nice, good ambience."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a quick bite. I liked the taste and texture of the noodles. The pork base soup was creamy and intense. The service was friendly and quick. There was no pressure for me to leave but 1 appreciated the quick service since I was in a hurry. I felt the earn was as good or better than the other downtown Ramen places."}
{"text":"The first thing I have to say about this place is that it's very spacious! It's the biggest ramen restaurant I've been to compared to the other ones in Toronto. The service was good and the prices are reasonable. However, I found the food to be decent, not the best I've had at a ramen restaurant.     Appetizers: 4/5 My friends and I ordered the Japanese poutine and a large Chashu platter. The poutine was surprisingly good! It was topped off with cheese, mayonnaise, oyster sauce, and seaweed. The Chashu platter included pieces of meat such as pork belly & shoulder which was good.  Ramen: 2/5 I ordered the regular Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen with extra meat, egg, and noodles. The noodles were good; comparable to Kinton's noodles. However, I found the broth to be too salty for my taste. Sansotei's and Santouka's soup bases are way better compared to Raijin's. Because of this, I could not give Raijin's ramen a high rating."}
{"text":"Just soooooooo delicious. The best ramen I have ever eat. I ordered a chef's recommend ramen. And that just soooooooo delicious.  Definitely gonna eat here again."}
{"text":"I walked into Raijin Ramen when I was craving for ramen and couldn't go to Santouka.  I got take out and must say the broth was really good but the noodles seemed a little under done. I know its supposed to be 'al dente' but this one required to much biting.  Its good enough to satisfy a craving but not the best you will have."}
{"text":"Have been a fan to this ramen house. It is now at anew location at the back ow 24 Wesllesly St West. The entrance of the restaurant is more trendy. The interior design of the ramen house is quite upscale. The size of the restaurant seems smaller but it has a new corner section for buying take out, like bento box, drinks and rice balls etc.  I ordered a deep fried chicken. Still delicious and crispy as it has always been. I will give it a full score of 5/5.   Also ordered a new item on the menu, it is the ramen in fish, pork bone and soy sauce soup. The soup tastes rich. When the ramen came, it does have a layer of sparkling oil on top of the soup. It's like the noodle in the northern part of Japan. The soup tastes rich, but a bit salty to my taste. The noodles are the thick one and the chashu is not bad. I will give it a score of 4/5   Will definitely come back for the carbon with garlic soup based ramen next time. It has been my all time favourite."}
{"text":"Came here on a particularly cold night so I probably found the noodles tastier than others. Usually at ramen places I prefer to try the regular soups just to compare, but I tried the vegetarian pumpkin soup option and it was surprisingly great! The pumpkin soup option probably isn't popular and doesn't have its own page like the other pork soup/miso soup options but I liked it over the spicy noodles.   The restaurant isn't big and it feels like they're wasting some empty space in the middle of the  restaurant (accommodating for the raijin statue in the middle) which is fine on a non-busy day. Most seating is the counter seats or around the raijin statue and very limited table seats.   Also, didn't see this until my way out, but checking in on Facebook gets you a free topping."}
{"text":"Not much to complain about here. The service was great, although we came in a few minutes after it opened. I got the lunch set which, at around $12, is a really fantastic deal. Ramen good, salad good, rice topped with pork thing, good.  The tonkotsu ramen (shoyu) is definitely up there with the good ones in Toronto. The slice of pork could have used a few more layers of fat. It was a bit leaner than I am used to. Come to think of it I dont think there was any fat at all. The noodles were firm, the broth was at around the same level as the best you can get around TO.  Overall I'm fairly happy with this place. Solid meal."}
{"text":"Love their selection of different ramen bowls. Service is consistently good and the ramen bowls are larger than most other places around town. The prices are comparable and I have never had to wait in line since their restaurant is significantly larger than other ramen restaurants.  They also have a small Japanese grocery store in the back where you get purchase various snacks, bento boxes, sushi and etc."}
{"text":"I definitely have a bias towards any restaurant with authentic Japanese service and this one doesn't disappoint. It is a model of efficiency, good taste and manners. The atmosphere is nothing special but it has a certain warmth and vitality due to the open kitchen and the din of the usually packed house.  The menu is small and simple. Only 3 or 4 main variations of ramen. I like it that way. I've tried the chicken broth and also the charcoal broth. The ability to add ingredients like seaweed or muer mushrooms adds some nice variety to the rather simple and pork-heavy soups. The charcoal ramen is quite a curiosity. It tastes good and is a bit like burnt sesame. I wonder what they make the charcoal out of actually. I think it does have some strong health benefits. I always feel great the next day after eating a bowl of it.  Another standout is the BBQ pork appetizer. Two different cuts of pork are cooked perfectly and seasoned just right.   The price of all this is very cheap considering the quality and quantity of food.   I did find everything a little oversalted, but maybe that's just me. I tend to eat my whole dish and it gets pretty overpowering by the end. Also, vegetables are short on the offering so this is not the place to go for vegetarians or those that like to keep a more 50-50 meat/veg ratio to their meals.   I think Kenzo offers a little healthier and more variety ramen but the atmosphere is not as good. Raijin is a good addition to the ramen scene and I will go back regularly."}
{"text":"Came to here for a casual dinner on Sunday night. I had the Tori Ship Ramen Combo with Torimayo Don Rice bowl and salad. I have to say this store didn't wow me. Taste was pretty average for a downtown ramen store. The chicken ramen soup didn't have the deep flavorful broth that you would be expect. I don't think I would visit again. I would much rather have santouka or Kinton ramen"}
{"text":"Ramen was very good! I was seated without a wait, and since I already knew what I wanted  from the reviews, I ordered right away.   The Shoyu ramen was good! Noodles were just right without asking for firmness. I got black garlic sauce on the side (no charge) which was nice. Chasu was on point, the egg was perfect and runny on the inside, the broth was very very good, but slightly too salty.. I had overheard the couple beside me say the exact same thing before my order came..   The sapporo was perfect, with the beer glass icy cold and the beer tasting good, as per usu (although credit would have to go to sapporo for this one )."}
{"text":"First off, the place is a lot bigger inside than it looks from the outside due to the extra rooms in the back.  The ramen noodle is just average as is the broth.  I got the spicy ramen option, which actually was just mild, which may have to do with their water down broth.  It wasn't horrible, but it's just not worth venturing out to if you have other considerations at your disposal."}
{"text":"A quick student (price) friendly ramen joint located near Ryerson. Larger than most ramen places so wait times are shorter than most, I frequent here if I need to quench my ramen rumblings. But I don't expect the ramen to blow me away. Noodle consistency, broth fragrance, cuts of meat are all decent but I wouldn't come here to showcase the best of Toronto ramen."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem! Upon entering, you are greeted by the entire restaurant. The servers are very friendly and attentive! This place is my favourite ramen place!   My favourite dish is the tsuke-men! I've tried tsuke-men in many other ramen restaurants, but I find other restaurants tend to make their broth a little too salty. But at Raijin, it is PERFECT! And it is always served with a perfect boiled egg!  If you're looking for something to have on the side, I recommend their takoyaki! It is made in the right consistency, crisp outside and gooey (but slightly firm) dough inside.  They even have a mini shop in the back for japanese snacks or food you can buy to take home.   The only thing I'm not a big fan of is the tables and seating spacing is a little bit cramped, but nothing too bad to get by because the food is delicious!  And just a tip for prospective customers, they don't serve any beef here. Just chicken and pork, but still very delicious!"}
{"text":"Ramen Raijin was previously on Gerrard (which was a blessing for me because it was so close) but has relocated last month to its Wellesley location. It is not exactly on Wellesley but it is very easy to find. When on Yonge, turn west onto Wellesley and you'll see a large 24-hour store called RABBA on the north side. You should see a Ramen Raijin sign telling you to turn into the small side street. Essentially Ramen Raijin is on the back side of RABBA.   The space has changed. The kitchen looks bigger. The dining area consists of a huge long table, with side tables as well as single seats at a bar. There is now also a small area like a convenience store selling bento boxes and Japanese snacks like mochi ice cream! Service is the same, very friendly and perhaps the waitresses are too eager to take your order (which is way better than not being attended to).   The food is the same, same price as before and same quality. Others have mentioned that the price is quite steep and I agree. You don't get a lot of toppings for the price and additional toppings will cost you at least $1.75 which is pretty crazy. But I think the quality is excellent. The noodles have been perfect for me everytime. The soup is piping hot and very rich.  I like to order the Gyokai Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen which is very flavourful, fatty and not overly salty. I order a smaller portion of noodles because the broth is very heavy (price = $10.50 for small and without egg). The only toppings were one slice of cha-shu, bean sprouts, green onion, nori and canola. Ramen Raijin is my #2 ramen shop in d/t Toronto with Ramen Isshin being #1.   For the sides, I have tried the karaage twice and both times it was crispy and delicious with mayo and lemon.   Menu is on their website: http://www.zakkushi.com/raijin/menu.php"}
{"text":"Other than their tasty ramen, their side dishes are pretty good too, personally love their takoyaki and gyoza!! And they have summer special from May to August - $9.90 for a pitcher of Sapporo!! =D"}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular about this place. So-so food, but that's all I got from my first experience here. I ordered myself a large plate of Japanese curry, and it only came with TWO (rather small) pieces of chicken :(. I think the bill came up to 10$ for it, leaving me unimpressed. I felt the value of that dish was rather poor-- it came with two pieces of chicken, about three heaps of rice, and two scoops of curry. The curry tasted good, but it wasn't amazing or as savoury as I hoped it would be. The plate DID leave me full, however, so that was good (probably because of the rice lol). I just wish it came with more chicken or at least more toppings because the curry itself was just a plain sauce. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing; maybe I should have stuck with their ramens; so I'm willing to give it another try!"}
{"text":"I discovered Raijin Ramen while walking down Gerrard street and noticed the big statue they had in the dining room. Decided to give it a try on a cold winter day.  We were greeted and seated right away with all the staff saying hello to us in synchronized Japanese fashion. Service was good but not great.  We ordered gyoza dumplings and ramen (of course). The gyoza was delicious but the ramen was just mediocre. I like being able to customize my ramen like they let you do at Kinton.  I don't think you'll be blown away but it's a good place to escape the cold."}
{"text":"I never knew about this place until I was brought here by my friend. It's very close to Ryerson University (which is probably why they have student discounts specifically for them).  The restaurant is small in scale, just like most ramen locations downtown. It's also convenient and near the subway station. The interior is actually quite cool too as they have a big japanese statue in the middle.  I got greedy and wanted to try multiple things at Raijin, so I ordered the dessert combo for $14.50 which includes a bowl of ramen, salad, drink, and dessert.  The salad came with ham bits, corn, and lettuce. It gave it a crunchy texture. I thought the salad dressing (not sure what it was) was tasty and refreshing.  For the ramen, I chose the Tonkotsu Shoyu pork ramen. The noodles was a bit different than the normal ramen I've had. It's more chewy with a rougher texture. The pork wasn't totally pork belly either but the meat was still very soft. On the side, there was one slice of seaweed and half an egg. The egg was not bad but not the best yolk-y type. However, I liked the soup base - it was savory and just right, not too salty even if I drank it alone.  Got a decent sized glass of Nestea for the drink. I believe you can choose between pop and tea.  Lastly.. DESSERT! The dessert was delicious! My choice was a cheesecake with raspberry sauce. It tasted much like tofu cheesecake with its super soft texture which totally melts in your mouth. However, interestingly enough, the top and bottom of the cake crust was still solid. Great for a cheesecake with that standard!"}
{"text":"Yes, I still ate it because it was warm and even mediocre ramen is still pretty satifying. But it took about 25 minutes to get served and the end result was not impressive. Chicken broth tasted fishy and watered down. The egg was a save since it was moist and perfectly cooked in the broth. Better options not too far away."}
{"text":"Definitely the best ramen place around! My coworkers and I have tried several others in the area and we all voted this one the best and we there regularly. We originally went to the Gerard St location and the soup base was exceptional, after a long awaited opening at The Wellesley st location we were a bit disappointed which encouraged us to venture and try others in the downtown core. However, we all agreed that Raijin Ramen is the best!! A definitely must try!"}
{"text":"It was certainly a plus that there was no line up, and service was also pretty quick and attentive. We got a poutine du Japon to start and I got the 5th element ramen (or something like that, don't really remember), and my bf got the shoyu ramen. Overall we were more impressed by the appetizer than the actual ramen. The chicken and pork belly from our respective bowls were very meh, and so were the soup bases. In addition, since it was an open kitchen I noticed that they charred the pork belly before it's served, meaning the pork belly wouldn't have the nice bqq'd flavour that the sansotei pork belly has since it wasn't cooked via bbq. The poutine however was amazing in my opinion (since there was mayo and I LOVE mayo). The fries were also perfectly fried; crunchy and didn't become soggy under the toppings. I also like how they give you a tiny serving of meat to munch on if you order a beer neat touch,  Though the ramen was a bit disappointing, my bf and I decided that this would be an awesome makeshift izakaya for those who don't feel like forking out the big bucks at Guu or Fin. Their appetizers are all really reasonably priced and appear to come in a good portion. Their beer is also on the more reasonable side of pricing when compared to other Jap drinking establishments. Put the two together and you get an affordable makeshift izakaya experience! =)"}
{"text":"It's that time of the year again, the leaves start to fall and all you're craving is warm soupy noodles. Cue ramen noodles.  Up until a couple years ago, my definition of ramen noodles was Mr. Noodles or the some sort of .97$ variety from the local grocery store. When I moved out west, my friends there introduced me to a ramen shop and I was hooked, a couple years later, I went to Japan and well, it's safe to say I've been eating real ramen noodles since.   The key to good ramen is 1) the ramen noodles texture, you want the noodles to be cooked, but with a bite to it and 2) the soup base. Rijian does ramen right.  I ordered the Tonkatsu Spicy Miso ramen (small). I should have gotten the regular, it was so good. The broth was creamy and delicious. Things dreams are made of. For the faint of tongue, it wasn't very spicy, so don't worry about that.   Every bite was incredible. It came with corn, cabbage and a generous portion of char siu (pork).   Honestly, if you haven't had real ramen before, you've got to try this!"}
{"text":"Got a miso ramen. Was too salty and lacked flavour. Noodles were me. Definitely paid too much, would've been happier with instant noodles at home."}
{"text":"Wow.  This place was not good.  The soup wasn't tasty at all.  The chicken broth was meh and the tonkotsu had zero flavour.  The gyoza filling was so mushy, the ingredients were unrecognizable.  You want to know what should make this place a zero star resto?  As we were putting on our coats to leave, we noticed something in the kitchen.  They actually scoop one ladle of water from where they cook the noodles, DIRECTLY INTO SERVING BOWLS.  Afterwards, they topped it with the actual broth!!!  We were shocked!!!!!  This can't possibly be standard for ramen shops!!!  If you're going to water down broth by 50%, maybe you should just close your doors now.  The resto is pretty much dead anyways, no line up at all.  (I thought it might be because the resto is so much more spacious compared to sansotei and santouka.)  NEVER coming here again.  What a waste of time, money, and tummy space!!!  NEVER AGAIN!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I have been to Japan, spent 2 weeks there, and this ramen restaurant made me feel like I was in Japan eating homemade ramen!! Very pleasant atmosphere. When you walk in, all of the staff greet you with a big hello, Japanese style, and help you to your seat. There was lots of energy in the room. My waitress was perfect, very courteous and explained everything to me. I wish I had room very desert, but I slurped down all my ramen. Can't wait to go back to this place next time I'm in T-town."}
{"text":"noodle was not cooked well enough(for me N my mom) only one piece of chashu pork whereas other ramen restaurants usually offer more than that. good service tho But there are always better choices for ramen in Toronto"}
{"text":"-- My First impression --  I love Japanese ramen. Since I was in downtown and my friend told me this ramen place was awesome, I decided to give it a try. Their location was very convenient, it was around 5 minutes walk from Eaton Centre (Yonge side entrance). There was a line up there (around 8 - 10 people in front of us). I think the way they assigned table was quite messy. I saw customer randomly walked in front of us and got a number. By the time I put my name on their waiting list, the server told us the waiting time was 15 minutes. We got our table within 15 minutes and I found it quite reasonable.    -- Food & Drink --   I ordered a Tonkotsu Shio Ramen dessert Combo (comes with a small Ramen, Small rice bowl, salad, coffee/tea/pop, and a dessert). I picked a Chicken Torimayo Don for the rice bowl and Coffee Jelly for dessert, my husband ordered a large Bamboo Charcoal Dark Tori Miso Ramen. I liked how their salad had a lot of corns, other than that it was just an ordinary salad. My husband could not finish the ramen because the soup base was just bland and the colour was not appealing at all. The most disappointing item was probably the coffee jelly dessert. The coffee jelly was very bitter and they were layered on top of the milk custard. The cup was too tiny and you could barely scoop out the milk custard with the jelly. They claimed there's matcha powder on top and the quantity was less than a pinch.   -- Service --  Servers were not very attentive. We had been putting our hands up for service. We had eye contact with the servers, and they just simply ignored us.  -- Overall --  I would not come back to this ramen place. Santouka Ramen, Sansotei Ramen, and Kinton Ramen are way better than Raijin."}
{"text":"When people talk about the \"big 3\" ramen restaurants near Yonge/Dundas (Sansotei/Santouka/Kinton), they don't include this place. Maybe they should. This place is severely underrated. The decor is by far the greatest of any place, and there is actually ample seating. You'll never have to wait for a seat in here.  The Japanese poutine with mayo and seaweed is excellent, probably even better than the ramen itself. Its presentation makes it look far more expensive than the $5.50 it costs. Fries are great because the oil is very clean. It's a must-try.  When I first went to Ramen Raijin, they didn't have a spicy ramen bowl. Now they do. It costs $10.50, and extra noodles are $1. Just like all the other ramen joints except Sansotei, there is no egg included. The extra noodle portion is generous but not quite as generous as Sansotei or Ryu's.  The bowl is overloaded with bean sprouts and lettuce, which prevented me from finishing the broth. You get one piece of pork belly, and a little bit of ground pork. The noodles have a very distinct bite and flavor to them that I can't really describe. Is this the flavor of actual fresh in-house noodles?  The broth is the weakest part of the ramen. It's watery and there isn't much spiciness to it at all. There's no heat like Ryu's, nor is there a complex taste like Sansotei. If it weren't for the reddish tinge in the broth, you could've told me that it was regular ramen. Because it's quite watery, the broth doesn't infuse itself into the noodles very much.  Despite the flaws of the ramen, I still think it's better than Kenzo or Kinton, in which my review was filtered.  The Japanese poutine is what makes this place worthy of a visit. Otherwise, expect a decent-but-not-amazing ramen, but at least the price is right, and the portions are filling. I'd visit this place over Santouka and Kinton, so perhaps the \"big 3\" should be expanded into the \"big 4\" and include Raijin."}
{"text":"The Poutine du Japon saved it! It was delicious in and super yummy.  Too bad that's all I can say about the food. I got the Tonkotsu Shoyu, the broth was ok but there was only a few slices of meat. I was super hungry afterwards. My friend had the Spicy Miso and it was pretty good. Cha-shu Plate was okay.  The ambiance was nice, this would have been a good restaurant if it had more meat in the ramen so I'm not hungry and cranky and write bad review.  And the $1.00 tasted just the same as the free teas in other Japanese restaurants.  Food 2.5/5 Service 4/5 Ambiance 4/5 Value 2/5  ========= Overall 2.7  Follow my adventures on twitter @iamSharky"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a very hidden area, took a bit of time to find. It's a relatively big restaurant. It has a small shop at the corner of the restaurant for some small shopping after or before dining (Japanese snacks, bento and drinks).   We ordered the Chichen Shoyu Ramen and Gyokai Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. Chichen has a light, but oily soup base, and Gyokai Tonkotsu has a heavy soup base.   I am not a fan of the Chichen Shoyu Ramen because its too oily. However, the taste/flavor of both soup are delicious.   Recommend: seasoned soft boiled egg !!!!"}
{"text":"I am getting worse at reviewing ramen places because they are literally ALL the same. Raijin has the same owner as Kintaro Ramen and Motomachi Shokudo, which are super popular restaurants in Vancouver. As you might have read, Raijin is not one of the best Ramen places in Toronto and is often overlooked. I had shitty expectations for this place but because it's close to Eatons Centre I thought I would give it a try. The service here is okay except they don't know their products that well. When we asked about the different portions and sizes, the waitress did not bring out any sample bowls she simply told us the weight. Not helpful at all. I asked her about the different soup bases and all she said was \"one is saltier than the other\". I was hoping she could elaborate and not give me one word answers. Anyhow the place was packed even during lunch time on a weeknight and I suspect that most customers are from Ryerson University.  To my surprise, the service was fast (other users did not agree). The soup is hot and I was amazed that the broth actually had some taste. My friend ordered the tsukemen and wow, it wasn't bad. When compared to Ryus Noodle Bar, this place obviously is a winner. The noodles for the tsukemen are smooth and easy to slurp. The broth itself is not TOO salty and and actually had more flavour than expected. Overall it was good but not amazing. Would I come again? Probably. My standards are still the same, nothing beats Sansotei."}
{"text":"As I understand Raijin is a spin off of Kintaro ramen in Vancouver, which is really good.  I've been to Raijin multiple times, and this is usually because the line at Santouka is too long, or I don't feel like waiting for noodles.  The Kintaro location in Vancity is definitely better.  This is probably the largest ramen restaurant in Toronto other than Ryoji (which is more a Japanese Tapas place like Guu or Hapa).  The prices are also the cheapest I found.  I've tried most of their options including the ramen in the black broth (black charcoal I believe), which wasn't all that great.  Stick to the classics. They give you larger portions, but the broth is a tad on the milky side.  Gyoza is a good deal - you can get a large order for around $5.  All in all, a good place to get your ramen fix if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"Ramen newbie and intermediate shared a steamy lunch on a nostril freezing day of shopping and exhibiting in Toronto. Traditional Tokyo Shoyu and all its ingredients was pungent and salty. Buttered miso ramen was creamy goodness. Noodles in both dishes had a bit less bite than we'd like. Eggs in each were cooked perfectly--held together even when opened, but the yolk still sunny and soft. Seats many, has indoor waiting, and cheerful staff."}
{"text":"My fav spot in the city for ramen. Delicious gyoza, good specials, and oh so rich and deluxe soup bases.   Pitchers of Sapporo are $9.99 during the week (not Fri or Sat)!!"}
{"text":"\"Bless your heart,\" said my inner 80-year-old grandmother when my table tried to talk to the staff at Ramen Raijin. The struggle was real.   The staff are quite nice. But their English is quite bad. No one speaks English fluently. Things like \"water\", \"see\", or \"move\" need to be repeated or accompanied with hand motions. I understand that English is not their first language, but it was still frustrating.   Remember to like and check-in on their Facebook page to take advantage of their specials. For the combos, it's a free topping. When we ordered, someone else in my party said we wanted the same free topping for both combos and the server said \"No, not two. He will want something else,\" referring to me. When she turned to me to get my topping order, I ordered the same topping... So, I just didn't really understand why the server said what she said. Question marks all around.   The food was pretty good. A regular size is a decent portion. Large if you're starving. They only give you one slice of meat, which seems a bit lacking, but if you don't care about how you get full, it doesn't matter. The salad and rice that come with the combo are very small and the dessert is a decent size. We shared our combos but if you were to eat it all by yourself, you would probably explode.   The broth is also pretty good. The soya sauce and salt-flavoured broths are a bit on the too-salty side, but still very tasty. The spicy broth was the perfect amount of spicy for me, as in not so spicy that you look disgusting in public and the flavour albeit a little strong was very good.   In general, Ramen Raijin was good. The language barrier was quite frustrating at times, but the servers are nice."}
{"text":"This place's noodles are pretty shitty. They taste like not even done yet. The only good part about this place is that they let u add more meat and stuff.  If i am going to use fast food ramen Su and Shi as benchmark then this place is definitely a below."}
{"text":"Went with: - group of 4, including one foodie and one japanese person  Had (prices available online): - tonkotsu shiyo; charcoal miso ramen special, japanese poutine, gyoza  Pros: - lots of options you can't find at the other Toronto ramen spots - e.g. Japanese poutine (japanese mayo, teriyaki, nori); charcoal miso ramen special - on the whole, is a \"cheaper\" ramen spot (especially when you throw potion size into the mix), not that it's cheaper by much (although, the gyoza is a total steal at $2.5/5 pc) - lots of space (much bigger than the other spots) - a \"lighter\" options (given that this is ramen we're talking about), like the clear chicken soup base instead of tonkotsu (pork bone) and their pork shoulder is not fatty at all  Cons: - a \"lighter\" option - one of my friends considered it too light (prefers the fattier pork & soup at Kinton/Santouka) - relatively more salty - not a lot of choice in ramen (i.e. can't choose soup richness like at Kinton), although there's lots of toppings you can add; and no \"sets\" (think Santouka)  Overall impression: - personally I would come here more often than Kinton and Santouka, because on a general basis, I prefer lighter soup bases (less rich, fatty). However, if you don't care about that, then the soup base is actually much tastier at Santouka and if I wasn't eating ramen a lot, I'd pick Santouka or Sansotei, which has the best balance IMO. - if you did come, would suggest the charcoal special over the pork bone soup base. - portion sizes are closer to Kinton than Santouka (i.e. larger)"}
{"text":"I am wanting to edge up Raijin to other ramen competitors in the general downtown core area. Love that rich broth.  I was recently on a \"ramen rumpus\" and compared tasting bowls at Santouka, Sansotei and Raijin. I had already been to the other two,but had not heard as much about Raijin and went in fresh. I enjoyed their tonkatsu shoyu ramen the most of all the bowls I tried that day. Everything from the broth, noodles, eggs and meat was super tasty and I had to hold myself back from finishing the whole thing. I had a lot of ramen to consume that cold day.  Santouka definitely had the prettiest presentation; their meat is superior to all and I appreciated all of the accoutrements (sesame seeds, chives, hot powder etc.) and miso broth. Perhaps it would be the overall winner if I were to measure up all categories of competition.   However, based on pure, visceral tastiness, it's Raijin all the way!!! Sansotei was my last pick (As an aside, I hear it's less traditionally Japanese and catering to Chinese palates), but with that said, all the places are pretty solid.  In terms of other ramen spots, I've had Kenzo a bunch (king of kings always!) and Kinton. I have to try Isshin on College St and see how it stacks up."}
{"text":"The ramen was delicious as well as the gyoza and chicken karage. Ann approves. We will definitely come back... But beware, don't drop the credit card machine!"}
{"text":"I had a hankering for food noodles and this was the closest place at the time.  Since I was dining alone, I sat at the counter where I could watch the cooks at work (or more accurately, avoid all eye contact with everyone by staring deeply at my phone). The chairs were sort of low compared to the counter, which was good because that made the meal closer to my face, but bad because I felt lik an 8-year old at the big kid's table.   I thought the meal took a bit long, considering it was really just noodles, broth and other stuff.  I ordered the pork shoulder with seaweed noodle soup in pork broth. The broth was extremely salty, there was one slice of pork shoulder and one sheet of nori. This seemed a bit scant for the $10 price tag. The noodles had a great bite and the pork was cooked nicely, but the salty broth almost killed it for me.  Service was friendly, but I don't see myself rushing back here again.  You can steal free wifi from the Big Slice in this place."}
{"text":"This is a really decent ramen place. They offer a widevariety of ramens and rice dishes. They also have drink (alcoholic) specials throughout the summer, so look out for that.  I got the shio pork bone-stock ramen. The noodles were good, not too tough or chewy. The soup base was very flavourful. However, it didn't have a strong taste that overshadowed everything else. I didn't like the fact that the pork slices were cold when i ate them. I think they expected the warmth of the soup to have heated up the meat by the time it got to the customer, but it didn't.  The overall store is spacious. I like Japanese food, but I can't say the same for cramped Japanese restauarants. I Hope more Japanese ramen places can be like raijin and embrace the Canadian values of personal space!"}
{"text":"Ordered a ramen bowl for dinner and it wasn't too bad, probably a second to Kinton.  The broth was rich, and the noodles felt like ramen.  Also lots of great customization options available.  Would return to try the different options."}
{"text":"There was literally 3 tables. 3 TABLES and the server FORGOT to put our order. Wtf?  We waited 30 minutes for our ramen and poutine while the people who came much later than us already finished eating ramen.   This was 5th time coming here and i really enjoyed the spicy tonkatsu ramen but i wont go back again"}
{"text":"I have been trying to go to more ramen restaurants in order to better understand the flavour profile of authentic --or as close as authentic as you can get-- in Toronto.  I must admit that although this place is incredibly convenient for me, I find the place sub-par in comparison to some other places I had visited on Dundas Street, the suburbs and elsewhere. Do not misunderstand, the food is not bad, it is just that I had better.   The restaurant itself is small but cozy with a few modern cues and the selection is not bad. You are able to mix and match certain items on the menu like the broths along with a number of (slightly overpriced) add-ons. However the portions although ok, also left something to be desired. They were a tad small for the price.   I can truthfully say that many a time I have left a Ramen restaurant feeling full and satiated, however at Raijin, the moment they served me my soup, I knew that I would have to make some food when I got home as I would probably be hungry shortly.     It is not a bad place, I just had better and I am sure I won't be the only one saying that. About the best thing to say, specially when considering the steep competition between Ramen restaurants in Toronto is that unlike other places, you won't find long lineups here.   Take that as you will."}
{"text":"I'm not well versed in the Ramen world, to be honest, but it was a great dish.  I had chicken with egg, the small was just filling enough. The food comes quick, prices average.  Good place, will def check out the new location."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and I ordered a small Tonkotsu Shoyu ($8.95).  The flavour of the soup base was alright, not bland nor salty but it wasn't the best. They normally give you 1 slice of pork shoulder and 1/2 of a runny egg, which I thought was lacking compared to other renowned ramen places in the area such as Sansotei, which give you the entire runny egg and at least 2 slices of meat.  The only upside to this place are two extra deals that they offer, one of which is only limited to Ryerson students (holla!). The other deal, which is open to everyone, is that if you check-in at their store on your Facebook account, they allow you to choose from a selection of add-ons to your meal for an extra $2. I chose the deep fried chicken kara-age and my friend chose the gyoza dumplings. The chicken was awesome in my opinion. Not only was it crispy, juicy, and tender, they also gave a generous portion that was definitely worth the extra $2! The gyoza on the other hand was just alright - like regular pan fried dumplings. The deal exclusive to Ryerson students is that upon showing your student ID, you get to choose a second topping for your bowl of ramen and after a quick calculation of what optimizes my reward, I chose an extra slice of chicken breast char-shu meat (which tasted alright).   The staff was friendly, following the traditional customs of screaming \"welcome\" in Japanese while you are being seated, and the atmosphere was nice.  Overall, I wouldn't come here solely for the ramen (since I'm more fond of Sansotei's), but if I'm with a bunch of fellow Ryerson friends and I'm feeling like a small side order of fried chicken, this place could be a plausible option."}
{"text":"I'm fairly new to the ramen trend and had read about this place in a magazine so we decided to give it a try.  Without any real other experience to compare it to - these are my thoughts..  Like:  The portion size and prices.  I had a miso soup with pork and it was so large I couldn't finish it and very tasty.  Very salty - to be expected.  Combo platters seem to be a good deal for a few extra dollars and you get the added rice and salad dishes.  Dislike:  My first menu item being unavailable after carefully reading of the menu - especially when it was full of simple ingredients.  A switch to a second item may have ended up a better option anyways.  I'd go back for more anytime.  Staff was very friendly, even the typical shout out for hello and goodbye.."}
{"text":"I went here for the fist time 2 nights ago, I must say I've really enjoyed my experience here compared to other ramen restaurants. They get +1 for spacious area, comfortable seating, and short wait times. It was great that I didn't have to sit elbows to elbows next to a stranger!  Appetizers: Karaage was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. Good portions. Gyoza were small but tasty.  Ramen: I ordered the Tonkotsu shoyu ramen. Broth was creamy and rich, very tasty. Egg was cooked perfectly, just wished it was a whole egg instead of only half an egg. (you could order extra toppings though) The pork belly was melt in your mouth! Noodles was a good texture, just enough bite and chewiness to it.  Clean washrooms. Good service. Overall, great place for ramen, I'm not sure about the old mixed reviews about this place but I can say it has improved a lot from my recent experience."}
{"text":"Happy Canada Day!!  Feeling like ramen after watching yet another weird Jeremy Iron and Tom Hiddleston film at the Carlton (High Rise).  Great open space with a combo of tables and bar seating around the Raijin statue. They  take your name down and you wait to be called.  Friendly service although it can take awhile to get them to take your order but the food comes pretty quick after that.  Ordered the tonkotsu miso ramen and the gyokai tonkotsu shoyu ramen which appears to be their best seller.  Oh and gyoza ...gotta have gyoza!!  Also tried pineapple calpico just because...  The gyokai ramen was amazing.  It has 5 types of soy sauce and I'm not sure if it's the soy sauce but the depth of flavour in the broth was amazing and makes it stand out as unique from all the other broths at all the other ramen places in TO.  The tonkotsu miso ramen was also equally yummy with a creamy pork bone broth with bits of ground pork that you find at the bottom which you can't resist spooning up with the broth to get every last bit of goodness.   If you order the ramen with egg you get the whole egg and not just half an egg.  It is cooked perfectly so it has a gooey yummy runny yolk inside.  Gyoza is also pretty darn tasty.  Crispy pan fried thin delicate skin enveloping a juicy meaty filling.  If you like ramen you will like this place.  If you have room for dessert check out the back of the resto as there's a little shop that sells Japanese and Asian snacks, ice cream, and meals to go.  Amazing!!"}
{"text":"As a ramen lover, today I took a detour and ordered a tsukemen. Namely you dip your noodles in piping hot, rich soup that is generally saltier than the normal tonkatsu ramen soup. Or that's what it was supposed to be anyway. The soup didn't come out hot enough at all. Just..... Kinda warm? Didn't even have steam coming off. :(  Next the toppings. Soft centres in the egg is a show of real skill and if you see in my picture, didn't happen. Egg yolk was completely cooked and even showed signs of hardboiledness. Second, the pork was not finished off by the torch nearly enough. Zero singe on the pork fat and the meat was generally under seasoned.   Noodles were Ok.   If you do come, don't bother with the tsukemen. Stick with the ramen. Better yet, head down the street to Santouka or kinton. Only plus is that this place is huge and the few times I've been here even at lunch time I've gotten a table with little to no wait. Yay. Ramen craving satisfied anyway."}
{"text":"Toronto has been going through a Ramen craze in the past couple years. Raijin is yet another place that offers authentic Ramen experience. The authentic experience includes real Japanese staff, and broth that has been prepared traditionally. Staff will shout in Japanese to welcome you just like Izakayas.   I'm not a huge ramen fan but I'd definitely come back when I have a craving. Prices are somewhat reasonable. I'm a big eater and frankly even a large doesn't fill me. But that's just me. My dining partner finished a medium and felt full. If the noodles don't fill you up, drink the soup!   It could be just me but I don't find much of a difference between all the new Ramen places. So while it's good, I don't have a special reason to come to Raijin over another place."}
{"text":"Love love love this place, and go there every time I'm in Toronto for work.  The staff are friendly and the ramen is *delicious*.  I always get the tonkotsu miso, and I always ask for menma - it doesn't come automatically, so you have to ask for it, but the menma here is especially flavourful and yummy.  I honestly don't understand why the rating here isn't higher - it's the best ramen I've had in Toronto, and easily better than any ramen in my own hometown (Victoria)."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this restaurant is their Japanese inspired poutine with the mayo. It's really good and it's definitely a good concept. What I didn't like:  - soup gets so salty - my friends ordered the charcoal broth Ramen and they didn't like the broth at all. It was too bland and th charcoal taste lingers and makes it worse - service wasn't at all great. It took some time for the server to get back to us - noodles had a weird texture. It didnt look appetizing at all  Overall, it was not a great experience compared to other Ramen places out there. There's lots of things on the menu, but they don't seem that great. A lot of people had great reviews about their ramen. Unfortunately, I was left a little disappointed. It lacked quality and taste."}
{"text":"I had gyoza and I loved it!  I knew I don't like the broth from here but I ordered it anyways and still don't like it lol. The pork was good though."}
{"text":"The spicy tonkotsu ramen is wonderful, though not overly spicy. I got the small size and split a side of the chicken karage with my friend - we were completely stuffed after. Service was fast and friendly.  Only thing not a fan of is the dish doesn't come with that many toppings and adding more can really add up. Even just green onions and bamboo shoots are a dollar each. The base price also doesn't come with an egg."}
{"text":"I first went to this ramen restaurant a few years ago and I recently tried it again at their new location at Wellesley on a day off with my bf.  I found that the quality stayed the same, unfortunately.  To put it simply, the ramen here was decent.  There was no \"wow\" factor, but at the same time nothing was terrible.  The service was pretty good, the broth was on the saltier side, and the prices were about a dollar more expensive that other restaurants, but I have no major complaints.  When I observed other clients around me, I noticed that they seemed to enjoy the establishment and their food.  My advice, however, is to avoid the spicy tonkatsu miso ramen (I may have mixed up the order of the name), as it only tasted like fat and chilli - there wasn't enough depth to it.  Try opting for a simpler broth, like the shoyu variety (which was the smarter choice that my bf made), as it was lighter, yet more flavourful.  I would still recommend coming here if you plan to go ramen hopping/crawling!"}
{"text":"Place: We went there on the New Year's Eve, this is the few restaurants open on that day. The restaurant located nearby Young St. So it is not hard to find. It is about 10 min walk from eaton centre. It is a really big store although facade looked not big.   Food?we ordered ramen, curry bowl, takoyaki and the cocktail. The plum wine is nice, takoyaki is not as well as I tried in another ramen bar. Ramen is the signature one we tried. The soup is fresh and delicious, there are many different size for the ramen. So you won't worry if you cannot eat too much. The curry bowl as well. You can also choose different size if u want.  Service: the service was enthusiastic, they welcomed us since we first came at the restaurant. All servers said \"welcome\" in Japanese to us. But later on, the service was a little bit slow. Maybe the New Year's Eve was busy. They forgot our order once. But after a while they made up for that. Overall, the service was not bad."}
{"text":"Interesting decor. Right off my campus, so very convenient. But most ramen places don't do it for me. Traditional ramen dishes are too salty and otherwise bland. Which is what I found my dish to taste like here. Therefore, this is not the joint for me.  However, they have non-pork options (chicken ramen dishes) as well as a vegetarian option (which is broth-less). The service is very fast and efficient. And if ramen is your thing, then I would check this place out. They close at 11pm, and last call is at 10:30pm."}
{"text":"2.5 starts, inconsistent quality, oily and salty soup.  I've been there a few times simply because there was no lineup. I've ordered the bamboo charcoal ramen twice. The first time I got the straight thin noodles, the second time I got the wavy thick noodles. I also tried the chicken soup ramen, got the wavy noodles again. The next time, I asked for straight thin noodles for my miso ramen but was told that they couldn't accommodate that because, according to them, straight thin noodles are only for chicken soup ramen!? WTH, I just had the wavy noodles last time in my chicken soup ramen!? Aside from the noodles quality control issue, the soup is always too oily and too salty.   I doubt I'll go back there again. There are reasons why there is always no lineup at this place...."}
{"text":"My only ramen stop in Toronto.  Found this place randomly.  At first I thought \"is it another wannabe ramen shop like in NYC?\".  Answer...no...no it's not.  You know it's authentic when there's a huge statue of Akuma (Street Fighter) staring at you while you're eating.  I'm a safe ramen muncher and don't really like the fancy stuff.  One Tonkotsu Ramen for me please!  And wow, was this tasty.  Not light at all.  Super creamy, super thick, salty...perfect for a snowy night in Toronto.  Add an egg and a butter topping too.  You won't regret it.  The staff is also extremely friendly.  Started a friendly chat with one of the waitresses and learned she likes to visit NY.  Maybe I made a friend?  Nvm, this review is about Raijin...not the waitress.    Raijin, next time I'm in Toronto, I'm coming back for more."}
{"text":"Their ramen is definitely not the best, but for the price, I still really enjoy it. I like how you can get a combo set with a salad and a rice bowl. I love love love their salad and rice bowl, probably moreso than the ramen. The ramen is mediocre, it's too salty for my taste and the meat is often dry and bland. But compared with the price of other places, you get a lot more for your money here and it is a pleasant experience. Service is good."}
{"text":"It was just OK for my liking.   My order: Tonkatsu shio black (Small) + Ginger Ale   Total: more or less $18+ (with tax and tip)  Pros:  - Ramen noodles were perfectly cooked and chewy  - Tonkatsu shio black oil soup base was just OK  - The servers were very nice and polite. Took down our order right away and smiled as well.  Very kind service.  Cons: -  Stuffing that they include in the soup are pretty much nothing. You have to pay for everything.  So basically your paying for soup, noodles and 1pc of thin meat. -  Would be nice if they added more green onions, bean sprouts, etc as free stuffings to begin with and then charge extra for more. Because the bowl literally had nothing in it except for soup, noodles and 1 meat. -  Pricy for the size you get even as a small bowl. Been to better ones then this downtown. -  Pricy for students. Poor students! Lol    Overall, would I go back here? Maybe ... but only under the circumstances that I happen to be in the area and there was nothing else to eat. But I wouldn't think of going back here just for Ramen.  Because I'd choose another better place that gives you more for your buck."}
{"text":"Sat on the stools right by the kitchen which is fully open, so part of this experience includes watching the entire cooking process.  These guys work in unison, everything flowing like a well oiled machine.    It's a relief to go to a Japanese restaurant that is actually run and employed with Japanese.  It's clear because they all speak to each other in Japanese.  It's hard to tell if they are yelling at each other or just typical frantic conversation.  What a cool language, wish I could speak it.  I went straight for the Kakuni ramen, since I like anything with pork belly.  Good sized portion, not too fatty and well cooked.  Wasn't crazy on my choice of broth, I'll go for a clear broth next time, but it was still good.  All in all the restaurant provides a unique experience and I will surely be back."}
{"text":"Tried the charcoal miso ramen. Very salty. Nothing special flavour from the charcoal. Will try pork soup base next time."}
{"text":"Was just ok...pricey for university food.  They yell out welcome for every entering guest but to me it gets annoying after a while,  especially since the turn over rate is high.  I hate how they charge you for an egg...really...it's an egg that probably costs you $0.10. Not much meet in the ramen.  Just another ramen place."}
{"text":"Ramen joint with Japanese chefs and no line ups. I'm in. However, the actual ramen and broth weren't as tasty as Sensotei and Kinton.   Also was disappointed by their \"Curry fries\". Didnt know it meant it was just fries with a very light dusting of curry powder? Small portion too.  Also not sure why they charge an extra $1.5 for adding ONE boiled egg to the ramen when other places come with an egg."}
{"text":"I got the small ramen and rice combo. The little side salad had a great sesame dressing. The rice bowl was shredded chicken with a mayo and teriyaki type sauces drizzled.. It was good, the rice was cooked well but nothing too amazing or it wasn't too salty either. I will try the curry rice next time.   My spicy miso ramen on the other hand was delicious. I've been going around the city to try different ramen bowls. This one might be tied for the top spot. It was rich,  full bodied and flavorful, a good amount of spice for my tastes. You know it's good when you drink the broth!  I would have preferred a seared piece of pork and in smaller pieces instead of one large piece.   My friends enjoyed their Shiyo based broth but thought the spicy miso was better. We also got the karrage (fried chicken) which was delightful from the large pieces of chicken.   I would definitely go again.   PS  Our table was under a leaking pipe in the back corner."}
{"text":"It was very spacious, unlike the other ramen joints in the area.  There was no need to line up for tables. Yay!  I've ordered BAMBOO CHARCOAL DARK MISO RAMEN ($11): Pork Shoulder, Bean Sprouts, Green Onion, Canola Flower, Seasoned Soft-boiled Egg, Chili Pepper Powder.    This broth was quite tasty and less greasy than other ramen choices.  The noodles were chewy but not tough.  The pork shoulder was a little dry with its thick cut.  The portion was quite big, so I couldn't order any other dishes.  I will come back again to try other items on the menu.  Service is okay.  I didn't have any problems at all.  Ryerson students can get discount when they show their student IDs. :-)  Friendly reminder:  Don't order bamboo charcoal dark miso ramen before any date or interview... you don't want to show off your black dirty teeth LOL.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Quite nice and good portion size. The setting was very nice and overall solid but it did not amaze me."}
{"text":"Hands down best go to ramen spot in the city. Very consistent unlike Kinton which use to be great. Broth, pork and noodles are perfection, unlike others in the city when one is always laking. Huge seating area in the back so you never have to wait in line! Must try on the menu, blackened bamboo no other place offers this yet and it's delish!"}
{"text":"My favorite place. I was never a big fan of Ramen, what's so special about these soup noodles, that taste overly salty or just nothing special? Until, I came to Raijin. Their spicy garlic is my favorite, I can't get enough of their creamy soup base. The portions are good, reasonable pricing, they provide discounts to Ryerson students (yay) I love how the noodles are just perfect, I prefer mine more firm and they do it just right.  I tried Sansotei as well and found it quite bland compared to Raijin. Raijin will forever be my favorite ramen place, a bit sad that they took cheese away as a topping, but I'll just bring my own lol."}
{"text":"I've visited this place twice. The food and the service was much better the first time. During my last visit my friend and I waited 25 minutes to be seated even though there were clearly empty seats in the restaurant.   Fortunately, they serve your food relatively quickly so we didn't have to wait too long after ordering.   Unfortunately, the ramen I got during my second visit was a little disappointing. I decided to try their vegetarian ramen, which tasted mostly of miso. Although the ramen wasn't great, the teriyaki poutine tasted good. Their non-vegetarian ramen probably fare better in terms of taste, so consider one of those to avoid disappointment!"}
{"text":"I got the Tonkotsu shio. It was okay. I LOVE instant ramen so I figured i would really enjoy getting the real deal. The broth was too creamy for me. I only had a few bites and unfortunately there's no way for them to wrap it up for me to go. I also had the Raijin poutine and it was actually SO delicious. I want to go back just for that!"}
{"text":"First time I came here was fantastic, total 5 star. Got the charcoal ramen and it was so fascinating, with the black coloured oil swirling around. The atmosphere is nice and the side order of gyoza was delicious and cheap (there was a special discount happening). A couple months later, I came again and something changed. I ordered the exact same charcoal ramen, but this time, instead of the juicy thick pork slices you usually get, I got these lean, flavourless pieces of meat. I'm not sure how the quality can change for the worse so drastically and so quickly. I haven't gone back since but recently a friend of mine went and also came out disappointed. What happened, Raijin?"}
{"text":"After hearing a lot of good things. we went to this rajin ramen place expecting quite a bit. So i went with a party of 4 on a wednesday night. we ordered a variety of things. there was a spicy ramen, Karage Large(popcorn chicken), and a boiled chicken don rice bowl.   The place was large in the interior and pretty nice looking. the menu was expansive. and had a variety of choices in size. This is where the good part ends. The karage large was ridcioulously small. It was so small i had t double check if it was large to make sure. because it had 5 pieces of chicken as a large which is crazy compared with all other Japanese places. and on top of it. the chicken was overcooked and dry. if small has 5 pieces i assume small comes in 1 piece. because the large cost 7.95 and was inexcusable.   on top of the ridiculous portion and taste, the rice bowl, was disappointing. because it was not good at all. they tried a different flavor, but it came short , as the flavors simply did not work.   the ramen was the only thing that was okay, it was a typical ramen affair, nothing special. but was serviceable. although i would say for the price of 12 dollars, which after tax and tip is 15 bucks and extra money for egg. it is definitely a waste of money and not worth the price.   overall rajin ramen, has been a large disappointment. the flavour being the biggest, the price and portion being another. I would recommend against people to try it. as its not worth it."}
{"text":"ITS GOOD. Got the spicy Tonkatsu ramen and date got the tsukamen. Overall, the Tonkatsu broth was rich and creamy without feeling overly heavy, and a lot spicier than other places in Toronto! The tsukamen was pretty flavourful in terms of broth - but could be a little thicker."}
{"text":"Food was good. The spicy miso was excellent. Had these little pork buns that were very tasty but not saucy enough. Gyoza was good but nothing groundbreaking. Will return."}
{"text":"had the small size Kara-Age dish and it tasted wonderful. the sauce was amazing! friendly staff, great pricing, the location is great. those are enough reasons for me to go back there!"}
{"text":"I ordered the one with the black sauce (forgot know the exact name), and it tasted really bad. Very wired taste. Don't order that one if you're going!!!"}
{"text":"from the front, this place looks like it could be very small, but there is a HUGE dining area at the back behind at the kitchen (in the middle) and near the washroom. I wonder if they seat people back there, every time I go, only the front is full. The use of space/design is not very well thought out.  The menu has changed a bit, I went with the \"add meat\" option for 3.5 more on my ramen and it was still not a lot of meat. It's on the pricey side, and they are stingy on the soup (it was a good soup, not too salty when asked for less salt & msg)  if there is a parking spot and no line up, I would come back again, otherwise I will keep driving."}
{"text":"Having been here about three times so far whenever I'm in the Eaton centre area, I'm surprised I haven't written about them yet! Anyhoo, what pushed me over the edge to write a review about Raijin ramen was their $11.95 ramen, salad and rice special.  It was bitterly cold when I went in so it was perfect ramen weather.  Their ramen is on par with ramen heavyweights such as Santouka and Kinton.  I'd say it's a three way tie if Raijin were to go up against them.  The ramen I had was the tonkotsu shoyu ramen, which featured a medley of beansprouts, green onions, a seasoned soft-boiled egg, naruto, nori, and melt in your mouth pork shoulder. The noodles had the perfect texture and bounce as I was expecting.  Finally, the broth was milky and was the proverbial cherry on top.  I enjoyed every sip, slurp and bite of of this meal. Oh. So. Good."}
{"text":"We are lucky to live in Toronto. The best city in the world for food. Where else can you get an authentic Argentinian chicken empanadas for breakfast then real Tokyo ramen for Lunch then real Lebanese for dinner and then Canneles de dordeaux for dessert.  NO WHERE ELSE.   Just came back from Tokyo on vacation with the family, got a little spoiled with the food especially ramen.  Missing Tokyo so headed over for lunch. This place is the real deal, Japanese chefs and servers add to the experience. We had the basic shoyu ramen. The pork fatalistically flavored with perfect amount of tenderness and bite. Ramen firm and soup was flavorful.   I bet you a bowl of ramen that you would have a very difficult time telling the different between their ramen and a bowl of ramen from a Tokyo shop....  The only complaint or observation since we were sitting at the bar and had a full view of the kitchen, was that the chefs or cooks were not very tight and not working well together. Usually in Tokyo the chefs and kitchen staff seem to be more precise with their movements, almost to the point of perfection, like a dance every movement had a purpose, these guys seemed a little off. Yes I am being ridiculous, but ramen is taken very seriously by some....ok. ok I will chill out.  At the end of the day, it is about the Ramen and it was great. Service was good too. Check it out."}
{"text":"Nice try.  I had the spicy miso ramen..  Wasn't that great,  tasty-ish at first but got too strong.  There are these little red things in my soup that reminded me of fish scales. They tried to make it creamy like by adding milk or something and it just wasn't that pleasant..   The ambiance is quite nice and cute but the food was disappointing and not yo to standard.   Like I said,  food was OK,  I wouldn't chose to come back."}
{"text":"For a Sunday night, this place was p a c k e d ! We were in the mood for ramen and wanted to check out a place that we've never been before so I opened my Yelp app to find a place. At eight o'clock, the line was long and went on to the sidewalk.   It was a little chaotic; I have a broken foot so I was dropped off in front of the restaurant. I tried to find a staff member so that I could leave my name on the waiting list; however, no one was in the area. After about fifteen minutes, a staff member finally surfaced. People were budding in line to try to get to this person and leave their name. A n n o y i n g. From the outside, this place looks quite small, but it's quite spacious. There are a lot of tables. We were seated in the back of the house at the booths. The menu is quite extensive with both tonkotsu and chicken based broths along with a number of flavours. They also have other izakaya style menu items such as karaage, edamame, and various rice bowls. I opted for the rice bowl combination: small shoyu chicken based broth ramen, torimayo rice bowl, and a little salad. We also ordered a Japanese poutine, which is basically poutine without gravy and teriyaki sauce instead (unique idea!). The food was all pretty good.  If you're jonesing for fast food and specifically ramen, check out this place.   Good for: ramen, groups, fast food"}
{"text":"We're big fans of this ramen house. The staff are friendly, the service prompt and professional, and the food is delicious. The bamboo charcoal ramen soup is outrageously delicious, and their gyoza and kara-age chicken are our go-to appetizers."}
{"text":"I have come here many times for Ramen. I have to say by far this place is one of my favorite ramen places in downtown Toronto. I have been to different ramen places. I find that I like this place because the seating is comfortable compared to other ramen places. The servers here are also very nice and friendly. I also think that their prices are reasonable and the menu choices are larger than other ramen places. They even have combo sets so that you can have more than just ramen with your meal. I think my favorite item is their broth, the flavors are just right. I am definitely a fan of this place."}
{"text":"Portions are very small. Fairly large menu that offered a variety of combos.  Ordered the small ramen + small rice + salad combo. The curry rice is literally just rice and curry sauce. The menu stated there would be pork but there definitely was nothing but curry and rice. Very disappointing.  The tonkatsu shio ramen was flavourful but only came with half an egg and one piece of pork. I ordered the small, my friends ordered regular and large and all sizes only include half an egg and one piece of meat. So disappointing.   The restaurant is fairly large and has three different seating areas so no need for massive line ups outside. The place is quite dingy and kind of dirty. Lots of paint chipping off the walls. Furniture doesn't look very well kept.   Service was fast and courteous.   Overall, nothing too special about this ramen place other than their combos."}
{"text":"Stepped into this ramen resto for a quick lunch before an afternoon of rock climbing.  Staff are super friendly and that's not surprizing for a ramen shop in Toronto (don't ever stop).  I think this is one of the first places to serve charcoal ramen within Toronto so that is what I opted to order.  It claims to be good for your skin and overall health.    The noodles were cooked just el dente and still had a bite of bite to them which made me glad I made the choice for additional noodles.  The broth with the charcoal powder mixed almost made it feel a little earthy with some heat.  The soft-boiled egg and two healthy slices of pork belly brought the hearty bowl together.  All-in-all, a great place to drop-in for a meal."}
{"text":"Shared with a friend a Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen, a Tonkotsu Shio Ramen and a Tako-Yaki side dish. Love the rich and creamy broth of both ramens. Got free Seasoned Soft Broiled Egg by checkin on Facebook. Tako-Yaki was good with the exception of one piece that was cold inside. The place was a bit loud since they scream to welcome each customer. Good environment for group dinner, not so for a romance date."}
{"text":"Love the new location of Raijin. Casual ramen house atmosphere. Service is good but they get busy quickly. The tsu-kemen dipping ramen is rich and a welcome change from your regular ramen experience. Gyoza skin was delicate and bursting with flavour, nice dipping sauce too. Juicy and super crisp karaage, no complaints. They have a small grocery inside too. We picked up onigiri for lunch the next day: 2 for $3.50 for the reg ones was a bargain."}
{"text":"This is one of the largest ramen restaurants that I have visited downtown.  I've only been once, so far, and had the shoyu ramen. The broth was amazing -- thick and rich, and extra tasty. The regular size bowl left me feeling really full, and cost less than $10 (before tax/tip).  I'll definitely be returning to try some more of their offerings."}
{"text":"Best gyoza in the hood for sure. I eat out here frequently. The ramen is first rate (possibly my favourite in Toronto). Make sure you enjoy every meal with a pint of Sapporo! They keep the glasses frozen to make for an extra enjoyable beer."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly disappointed with the food quality. I ordered the yuzu chicken broth cold ramen, and was promptly food poisoned. It was not a pretty sight, and I was in the washroom for at least 30 minutes battling explosive diarrhea. I probably won't be able to go to work tomorrow morning because I made the poor choice of coming to this restaurant on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"EVERYBODY STAY AWAY FROM RAMEN RAIJIN... THIS IS MY SOULMATE, AND I HAVE CLAIMED IT. Stay away immediately!!!  This is my favourite ramen place of all time, right on the corner of yonge and gerrard. The first time I came here, I was not a fan because they were super busy and kind of ignored us for awhile. After that though, the service was great and it continues to be today. You're greeted immediately and they help you find a seat asap. One good thing is that this ramen place is huge, compared to so many other ones. There's an entire back section, and that's good because it rarely gets filled to the brim, like kinton, where it's spilling asians out of the door.  The food is super amazing. The ramen broth is creamy, milky and has the right flavour without being super oily or heavy. The ramen noodles are texturized and thick. Yum! The prices for ramen are $10+, which is standard nowadays. They also have combos, which is rare and you can mix and match a lot of food for a set price. They have combos for individuals and combos for sharing with friends. Perf. I also love the 'pink beer', which is sapporo + raspberry lemonade? They use real lemonade so you can taste the chunks a bit- which is great, until you get to the very end... then it starts to taste like the metallic taste of blood... what?? I don't know..  Still, this is the best ramen I've found in toronto and I LOVE IT. So... stay away from my bae."}
{"text":"The selection of ramen dishes are pretty slim and although the broth is passable, the actual ramen noodles and toppings are much to be desired. I ordered the spicy ramen bowl and the broth was barely spicy at all, not even close to what you would find in tom-yum soup. They include 2 thin slices of pork shoulder, half an egg, and some seaweed to go with noodles which looked like something out of an cup-of-noodles.  Nonetheless, the dish over $10 and I still felt hungry afterwards. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen was one of the best. Great spicy flavour with quality noodles. We also ordered a Large chicken Mayo bowl. The large rice dishes are not large at all, maybe for lunch but not for a dinner. We suggest to order a side of delicious Kara-age and mayo. The hojicha pudding was a nice dessert to wrap up the experience.  There is a giant share table in the center of the dining area. Expect to be placed there during busy meal hours, but we opted for the bar tables in front of the kitchen instead.  While it can be loud when all the staff greets and thanks each and every customer in unison, the environment is pleasant, spacious and airy.  Overall a great meal and a nice change from the usual joints."}
{"text":"Friends and I came here for dinner after board games. The entrance to this restaurant is a bit hidden so you have to really follow the signage near the restaurant that will point you in the right direction. Even using Google maps doesn't necessarily get you right to the restaurant. When coming on Wellesley, it's actually around the back of the condo building and you really have to follow the signs to get to the restaurant as you can't go through the condo to get there. It wasn't too busy when we arrived so we were able to get a table for 6 people. It was quite the cold day so ramen was the perfect choice for our dinner. I ordered their signature ramen dish was the Gyokai Tonkotsu Shoyun Ramen with Egg. Our ramen bowls came out pretty quickly. Good amount of noodles, the egg was good and the overall dish was seasoned nicely. My feedback for them would be to include more meat. I felt it wasn't enough meat in the ramen bowl. Service was good and the staff were friendly. They also a small snack shop located in their restaurant that sells a lot of authentic Japanese snacks. Overall, a pretty good dining experience here and good quality ramen that's not too salty. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place - I don't even remember what I ordered, I don't think it was anything fancy, but it was delicious! The regular size was pretty filling, and the broth was better than some place in Baldwin that I had been to previously. It wasn't complicated to order, either!  Check it out if you're in the area and craving ramen!"}
{"text":"Great place to have some nice ramen, and many other dishes with friends. Service it also very kind when greeting you and see if your food. Definitely one of the best ramen I've tried out of overall 6 ramen places I had tried in the GTA"}
{"text":"This review is based off  Tonkotsu Shio Ramen small  ~$8.95 in comparison to my other ramen experiences!  Each page of the menu displays details of each ramen bowl available, with different combos that include (and/or ricebowl/salad/dessert/drinks)  Soup: pork bone and fish dashi flavour was subtle and was primarily a slightly more salty, but creamy soup. The surface of the soup had black bubbles which I assume to be black garlic oil, was not overwhelming. Even though you cannot customize the flavour of the broth, it was a very consistent broth that wasn't overly salty to the point of dehydration! I was looking for the \"soup sand\" (ground up bones), but there was barely any.  Noodles: They were edible, but mostly hard and dense. Not my favourite.  Toppings: green onion, canola flower (tastes like chinese broccoli), kikurage mushroom were all finely chopped and freshly prepared. They gave one decent slice of pork shoulder, with only small portions of fat attached to the meat, which would've been better if it was torched. The texture of the meat was well put together, but I've tasted better with better seasoning.  The restaurant was spacious unlike a lot of other ramen shops around the area, but alike most yelpers' experience here, the language barrier was strong, despite their attentiveness.  Regardless, the small was sufficient as a full meal, as well as to fully savour the soup, considering that I hadn't eaten for the whole day"}
{"text":"I went to this place expecting a lot. Ramen being one of my favourite things. Was here on a wednesday night with a few friends. i was really looking forward to the ramen.   i feel the interior design was nice and spacious  i ordered a spicy pork miso ramen. the soup in the ramen was very salty, and MSG taste. basically i couldn't drink any soup becuase it was really over salted. the noodle feels like instant noodles. and the pork is average. the egg was good, which i had to pay extra for. The ramen was really missing a lot of toppings and literally this regular sized ramen only had 1 piece of pork. my feeling is for the price they are charging, and the flavour it wasn't worth it. The taste is not good. and the portion is not a deal at all.   there are so many ramen places in the area. which is why i'm surprised why this one had such a high rating, because it is really not good or worth the money.   i would not recommend this to anyone, as there are much better ramen places in the area, and as well in the city. it is not worth it taste wise or price wise"}
{"text":"Took me a while to find the restaurant after it has moved. It is at the back of 24 Wellesley West, and that's the reason I couldn't spot the restaurant when I drove by. The restaurant looks trendy. I like the glass door and windows which I could see the inside of the restaurant from the outside. As I went in, the restaurant has a separate section for buying take out, like drinks, rice balls and bento box, and candies etc.  They have a new menu but they don't have many choices of beer. So I only ordered a local beer.  For food: I ordered a Karate - deep fried chicken (score 5/5) It is crispy and delicious. It is not greasy at all. Highly recommended.  Ramen: (score 4/5) This is a new item on the menu, pork bone, fish and soy sauce soup based ramen with chashu. The presentation of the ramen is nice. I could see a think layer of oil on top of the soup which made my ramen looks sparkling. The soup tastes quite rich. I could taste a special taste other than the pork bone. I believe the soy sauce in the soup made the ramen a bit salty.  They use the thick type of noodle with sprouts and a little of green veggie in the bowl. In general, the ramen is not bad."}
{"text":"We were craving a hot bowl of soup noodles and we were pressed for time, so we decide to give Raijin Ramen a try.  (Primary decision factor: we did not want to wait, so I decided to suggest Raijin over Sansotei or other smaller ramen locations that had a great reputation)  I came to the restaurant after reading some reviews, so I expected no wait lineup, good tasty ramen, big portions and fast efficient service.  Raijin met expectations in all those areas.  We ordred the Tonkatsu Ramen, the Dark sesame looking Ramen with chicken, a chicken rice bowl, and Takoyaki (squid balls).  The tonkatsu ramen was tasty and well seasoned, though I found it slightly salty.  The portions were large and the prices were reasonable.  I've had better ramen and also had worse, Raijin's is about average.  They get extra points for tasty Takoyaki, efficient service, and big portions.  A good place to go if you are craving a hot bowl of noodles and no lineup!  Overall 3.3 / 5.0"}
{"text":"I love this place so much!! Of course the ramen taste is amazing. Appraisers are also delicious and fresh! Also cost performance is good! I think raijin ramen is the best ramen restaurant in toronto."}
{"text":"Wayyyyyy too salty but the broth deserves it's praise for  flavour.  Noodle was probably the best thing about this dish as perfectly done to my liking. I'd still say this place is 2nd to santouka as it is the best place IMO but for sure,  broth taste much better than kinton."}
{"text":"Since there are many good ramen joints in Toronto, it can get hard to chose the best one out of all. In the end, I believe that it all depends on the preference. I am not too picky about ramen as I can't really tell the huge difference anyways unless I order exactly the same thing from different places.   Raijin Ramen offers good ramen overall, and I like how it is very spacious compared to other major ramen places in downtown. If the line-up is too long for Sansotei or Santouka, I recommend this place as an alternative. The location is convenient too for those who are shopping in Eaton Centre. Service is friendly but a bit slow although the place was not packed.   Overall, good food and good location. I haven't seen a line-up for this place yet so if you are not patient enough to wait for other ramen places, just go to this one!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on a Wednesday during lunch time. We got seated and served quite fast even though they were a bit busy. We ordered a small tonkotsu shio ramen and a small vegetarian ramen. The soup for the tonkotsu was good! It was creamy and flavourful. But the noodles was only alright because I think it was a bit hard and tasted like the ones from instant noodle..  I was 75% full with the small so if I do come back next time, I think I would get a large size.   The place is very spacious and waiters/waitresses are very friendly.   Overall experience I would give a 4 star!"}
{"text":"Wow, this restaurant was awful. Not to say it doesn't have promise, but right now, it's worse than Kenzo, which isn't even run by Japanese people (then again Japanese people run the zero-star Tokyo Grill.)  Ordered tonkotsu miso. The pork was much thinner than Kinton. The soup was really fishy, which means that they put too much Dasshi in it. It was also oddly rich, which I figured out later was because they put too much oil into it. It wasn't rich because they put a lot of pork bone into it, that's a different kind of richness. Probably comes from the ground beef and cabbage (WHY?) that the cooks put directly from wok to noodle bowl. I could see the oil dripping off it into the soup.   Did not taste like any of the ramen shops in Vancouver (even the awful Ezogiku) even though it's supposed to be a branch of a Vancouver shop.  Menu very small. Reviews said they had things they didn't have - I came wanting Tsukemen and all they had was the three \"standard\" ramens with some variations. Why give stuff to reviewers THAT ISNT ON THE MENU??  Service was both too slow and too fast. Soup took forever to come, and then I put down the chopsticks for ten seconds and already the waitress was asking if I was done. I say yes, and within three seconds I get the bill. The place was half-empty so I don't get what the rush was.  Very chilly atmosphere. Waitresses are a bit too artificial. Yes, they might be \"family friendly\" because they aren't a grungy cafeteria like Kenzo or a hole in the wall like Kinton but don't take your kids here. They will grow up thinking that ramen tastes like cow droppings.  Very disappointing. If you want ramen, Kinton is pretty much the only good place in town still, sadly."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place! And the ramen is pretty taste and flavour! The pork ramen I got melt in your mouth  the only thing about is  the ramen was a little too salty and the restaurant itself was very difficult to find, It's very hidden! And also the topping should be at least a few cents extra not by a dollar honestly!   Nevertheless I will be going again if when I'm in the downtown core again"}
{"text":"Easily the best ramen I've ever had. Granted TO is a ramen town and I'm from DC where it's harder to find but I'm a big fan and this exceeded the very good ramen in DC in every way. I got the tonkotsu miso broth which was creamy and complex and just delicious. The soft seasoned egg (slight upcharge) was just perfect. I also tried the plain tonkotsu broth which was super flavorful as well. Service was friendly and enthusiastic and there was more seating than most of the other ramen shops I spotted nearby. $12.99 specials on Sapporo pitchers during the week too! Prices good overall for the quality of good ($11-14 per bowl which was huge). Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"It was a ramen kind of night and we decided to go to Raijin. I heard about their yummy gyoza and was determined to try it. My friend who has been here a few times ordered the Tsuke-men, which is something different I don't see at a lot of ramen places- essentially, dry ramen with the soup on the side. My other friend and I ordered the Noukou tonkotsu shio ramen.  I enjoyed the ramen and the soup since it was rich and creamy but not too overwhelming. The noodles were chewy and made just right. I also liked how you can choose the noodle sizes here and how the EGG is not an additional cost. At the other ramen places, I always get the egg even when it's extra, so coming here was definitely a bonus. I have been to the very popular Santouka and Sansotei and I highly recommend them as well. However,I actually quite enjoyed Raijin though there are more mixed reviews. I am really interested in their ramen with the chicken broth especially since my all-time fave ramen in NYC is at a place that serves the pork and chicken broth combination.  I will be back for more since there is quite a bit of variety. One other thing is, every time I come downtown for ramen, I always have to wait a long time, I was very glad to see how Raijin is a lot bigger, but still very busy!"}
{"text":"I only come here for their spicy miso ramen. Thats about it. Other people find it too spicy or too salty but I like it. Its all a matter of preference. I like a kick to it that might be over the top to some people.  I like their combo menu as well.. if am particularly hungry its good to order it but usually I skip it now when I go there and opted to just order kaarage paired with my ramen.  If your complaining about the size portion, you have to come back at least more than once to figure out the difference between small and large to figure how much you can eat. I normally can finish a bowl of a small ramen because thats enough for me.  Overall, I recommend this place because they have a good seating area for a large group of people as well as pairs...and the place is well ventilated, clean, and the staff is efficient."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this place, we got there 5 mins before they open at 11 am on friday, as soon as we entered the place everybody welcomed us and we were seated, people start coming in like crazy, 15 mins and the restaurant was full even the back. They were super fast at bringing food and it tasted amazing! The noodlea and the broth were perfect, we were very happy we tried this place. From all the ramen we have tried, this is our favorite now and we are definately going back.  Awesome place!"}
{"text":"3.4/5  I don't understand why this place been getting bad reviews. I have been to most of ramen places in Toronto and this is my third favorite place for quick ramen fix! First is Santouka but due to their horrible service (been 5 times and each time I had bad service) and my thin wallet..   They offer decent portion for reasonable price. My favorites are spicy miso, tori and bamboo charcoal miso. If you are not a huge fan of fatty ramen, go for spicy miso. It's mildly spicy and spiciness kills fatness of ramen a bit but you will still taste their delicious silky pork & chicken miso broth. If you like something creamy and smooth but tired of pork miso broth, go for tori. It's milky chicken broth is clean but full of flavor. If you like garlic and want to try something different, try bamboo charcoal miso. This one has a bit of up and down days but if you are lucky, you will get to try smooth rich miso broth with smokiness of bamboo charcoal and perfect touch of garlic oil.   I find out their regular miso is bit boring so won't recommend it. Most of time they are quite consistent with their ramen.  Also they have a large space at the back so it's good for large group.   Due to low staff members, service can be little unattentive and slow. And some staff aren't really good at English so you might have little challenge with communicating with them. Other than that, it's pretty good place to check out."}
{"text":"Thinking that this would be another typical ramen place, our party of 3 decided to try it out on a Friday night. How completely wrong we were! They were full, but service was terrible. After we were seated, we didn't get any water or any service for another 10 minutes. After struggling to flag down a server, we got our order down completely. Food took almost 20 minutes to come, which is pretty long, considering the kitchen was in full swing when we went and we ordered appetizers as well as 3 bowls of ramen.  There was nothing special about the ramen, if anything the broth was saltier and thicker than other ramen places I've been too. The kara-age, Japanese fried chicken, was nice and juicy, but a handful of pieces of fried chicken for $7 seems excessive. Interesting concept about their menu that mirrors those in Japan, are that they offer rice and ramen in the same \"set\", so you can have a bowl of ramen and a bowl of rice in the same meal. This set would definitely appeal more to those who either want to split the set or tend to eat larger portions.  Considering the slow and lacking service and mediocre quality of food, we probably won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Unlike the expensive and overrated Santouka, Ramen Raijin actually recognizes it is within the Ryerson campus precinct, and will offer students a small discount on their meal. Or you could go for their weekday lunch specials. Also, no lineups!  The menu is short, and ranks on the upper end of affordable. On my first visit, I had a shio ramen, and it was okay. Service is also okay, if not at the least attentive. Another time, I went for their Bamboo charcoal dark miso ramen ($11). I have never seen broth that black, but don't let that impression deceive you on what a medley of taste this specialty of theirs is.  It occupies retail space that has a reputation in the Ryerson community for being 'cursed'--a few other business have set up shop at 3 Gerrard E and quickly disappeared during my time at Ryerson. Raijin has been here for quite a bit, and shows no sign of going away thus far.   For the food and atmosphere, it can easily hold its own amongst the city's plethora of ramen houses and chains. Raijin is a good place to have some decent noodles if you are in that part of Yonge or the Ryerson campus (or just want a change from Salad King).  {TTC: Walk your butt off to Gerrard from either Dundas or College stations}"}
{"text":"I arrived around lunch time to Raijin Ramen. One weird thing I noticed was throughout my waiting time, I saw at least 5 people leaving the restaurant but none of the staffs came to tell me there were seats available inside... (I was the next person in line for a seat) It just felt weird as I know there were empty seats but they didn't do anything and the line was just getting longer for no reason. I don't think it takes them 30 minutes to clean tables, right?  After all the waiting time, they finally told me there a seat available and that I can go in. When I entered, I noticed there were at least 4 seats available but they only called me in... I didn't really appreciate this as I don't get why do they do this? It felt like they want people to line up...  They have a wide variety of Ramen with chicken or pork based soup and the waitress recommended me their \"Gyokai Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen (blend of 5 types of Soy sauce)\" and their \"Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen\" (which is also their #1 selling ramen) for spicy lovers. The above mentioned ramen are all pork based soup and she recommended their \"Chicken Shoyu Ramen\" which is made with chicken broth. I opted for their Tonkotsu shio ramen (without egg) because I prefer pork broth and the slow roasted garlic oil really attracted me. I regretted not ordering it with egg since a bowl of ramen without a marinated soft boiled egg is incomplete!   My ramen came in a bunny bowl and it just made me happier as I love bunnies! The garlic oil really made the ramen more flavorful but overall it got a bit too salty when I was finishing up with it (yes, I know I ordered a Shio ramen, so it's normal that it was salty). I loved the broccolini inside my ramen, it was something new and it went well with everything else! The meat was really tender and the portion was quite big compared to most of the ramen restaurants in Montreal! Their noodles were really chewy and not too soft! Next time, I think I would opt for their Tonkotsu Miso ramen (with egg), which should be creamier and less salty! I also really want to try their Karaage!  Raijin is placed as my #3 ramen in Toronto. I would go back to Raijin Ramen but I really think they should improve their service. The waiting time is ridiculous considering there were seats available and they still make people wait in the line. I wouldn't be complaining if the restaurant was jam-packed, but they weren't... And also, I asked for a glass of water when I placed the order since I told the waitress that I'm a bit scared it would be too salty. However, my glass of water never came until I asked for a second time (and by that time, I was almost done with my ramen)."}
{"text":"Updating my review. Just went for lunch and I was pressed for time so I asked the server to pack up my meal to go, I had only literally eaten about 1/4 of it. Waited and nothing. So I went to the front counter where they told me they threw it away.... The server apparently didn't understand English and thought I was finished my meal. This was super annoying. Who throws out a whole meal? If he didn't understand me then why not get a server that does speak English? Also... Why are you employing someone to interact with customers if they don't understand the language? So I had to ask for a card saying I get a free soup next time which isn't what I wanted, I wanted my soup to go so I could finish it tonight. Disappointed. Perhaps I'll stop coming here and go to santosei instead from now on. An additional note is that the last time I came I tried their special collaboration ramen and it was ridiculously salty. So much that I had to switch with my dining partner. That's also a strike against this place."}
{"text":"Having an over-abundance of ramen in my life has made me a bit spoiled and picky - this place is totally fine...above average even! I'd rate it a solid 3.5 stars if I could, and my rating is largely based upon my selection and pricing.   Came here after work one weekday evening with 2 other friends, and got seated quite quickly despite a busy night. Service was warm and friendly, as well as prompt. We ordered the chicken karaage which was crispy, juicy on the inside, and not oily, although we all felt that it lacked some sort of dipping sauce. I ordered the seafood broth ramen, which was delightfully creamy and rich, but not quite as flavourful as I've experienced in the past. The quantity was appropriate, although as other reviewers have commented, a bit of extra meat (e.g. more than one piece) for the price would have been appreciated. The extra $2 for a simple boiled egg was a bit of a turn off.   Overall, I would definitely come back and try some of the other selections. And not sure why people had such a time finding this place - google maps people!"}
{"text":"I ordered the tonkatsu shoyu ramen with karage on the side and it was delicious! The restaurant is located in a really weird area, my friends and I had to walk through an alley to get here but it was worth it! The inside of the restaurant is very nice and the staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"We came here after a shopping trip to bed bath and beyond across the street.  Since I'm currently on a noodle kick, I had to try it.  It was ok, but I prefer Kinton as well.  The décor here is nice, the tables are big, and there isn't a line up.  The service was ok, not too slow or super creepy Chinese take out restaurant fast.  Overall, it's good if you're in the area and having a craving for ramen."}
{"text":"*sluuuurrp*  Raijin has a good amount of toppings. It's not just noodles with a lot of soup. The pork is not too fatty, nor too dry. I think it's pork shoulder. I also like the amount of bamboo shoots. They are not stingy like some other places.  Soup base selection is different, but in a good way. The \"blackened\" oil adds a nice smokey flavour to the plain pork soup base. It's a must try.  It's my favourite ramen place so far."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen places in Toronto!  I tried their Tan Tan Men and the flavor was full of umami. Reminds me of the quality in Japan!   The price is relatively reasonable compared to other more expensive places in Toronto. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The miso ramen was good, but it was a little too salty for me. The corn and cabbage toppings were really sweet, but didnt really go well with the ramen.. The annin tofu was really good and i was tempted to order another one."}
{"text":"My son and I had the Spicy pork ramen and gyoza, it was absolutely delicious.  Service was great, table by the window...even the green tea was good."}
{"text":"Ramen raijin seems to have gone downhill recently.  Though the noodles are flavourful and the combos are reasonably priced, the soup is too salty, the noodles are too hard, and the meat is a bit tough at times.  I do like the many options on the menu and the amount of food you get is worth the price.   Make sure you drink lots of water, though."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place two stars because honestly I probably would not return. There was nothing particularly bad about the experience but I was not impressed. Firstly, I really did not like the set up.. it was a weird set up. The place also didn't look very clean. Secondly, the ramen was not bad but it was way too creamy and heavy. Maybe it's a personal preference but I don't like super creamy ramen. Thirdly, service was meh. Not particularly friendly or attentive but not terrible."}
{"text":"First time to come to this shop.  At 1pm on Thursday, no line up and guide to the seat immediately.  Placed an order for a large side of basic ramen #1 without egg.  Wait, wait and wait. After 25 mins, asked the waiter how long will I have to wait more and discovered that he hasn't put my order in.  This is a bit ridiculous. They work there daily and should know how long to cook for a noodle. And able to see me sit for long time without asking or checking the order status. I wonder if I don't ask, how soon they will discover my order is not in system.  Anyway, new order replaced and came in very short time.  And only took me 5 minutes to eat .  A bit salty, but for one slice of meat and seaweed and little veggie (and no courtesy on anything due to their fault) Really waste my 25mins waiting time.  Sorry, you lose another customer."}
{"text":"Doing my first review on Yelp. First time at this restaurant, just happened to be in the area. The broth was amazing. Service was great. will definitely come back to try other ramen."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: quite spacious, I like how your not sitting shoulder to shoulder like other ramen places, the chefs also greet you as you enter and leave   Price: $9.00-13.00 Food: Tonkatsu spicy miso: super delicious! The amount was perfect, noodles resembled Kintons (crisp and not overly done) there was a mix of bean sprouts, corn, cabbage, which made it different from other ramen places. The meat was tender, and soup full of flavour.  Chicken karage: crispy, with the insides being tender .  Overall: I'll definitely be back! Service was good! Definitely one of my top 3 ramen places"}
{"text":"There wasn't a line here when we visited and I think now it's apparent why. While the ramen had some highs, overall it was a bit disappointing. I don't have complaints about the service, environment, speed..etc. Everything seems to be on point. Knowing these guys are part of the Zakkushi empire kind of explains the slightly high prices. Overall, it's worth a try to say you've tried.  Ramen is really of 2 parts; broth and of course the ramen (noodles). It's all about texture and flavours. The rest of the stuff on it are just the fixings (cha siu, egg, sprouts...etc). These guys make a good broth though I would argue the flavours can be a bit bolder. My black garlic broth wasn't too garlicky and maybe just a little on a creamy side. It also could use a little more depth but despite these faults, it was still somewhat balanced. Cha siu was on point; tender and tasty. The egg was also nicely done with a slightly runny yolk and bit a sweetness to it. However, my partner's eggs tasted a bit funny -- too much sourness from a bit too much mirin. The noodles.... I was unfortunate to get the extreme yellow noodles (I didn't pick them, it just came with it). I love yellow but just not yellow in this case because yellowness in ramen typically means too much kansui (ya! I dunno how to translate this but it's lye/baking soda water basically). Kansui is often added to ramen to alter it's PH hence giving it an almost crisp, bouncy, springy sort of texture. It's a technique very frequently used in Asian kitchens. Yes, those tender, springy shrimps in your stir fry have been bathed in baking soda. Anyhow, back to the noodles. Kansui has a distinctive iron-ish, odd taste to it. These noodles had a lot of it and you definitely taste it as it was very overpowering.  Maybe the next time I visit (if ever) I will ask for noodles that are not so yellow? LOL This place is alright but with so many cheaper options nearby I question whether it's worth it."}
{"text":"Came In on a Thursday night around 10 Fast service great price food came out quickly. Combo set is a real deal!"}
{"text":"The saltiness of the shoyu ramen soup was too strong. I'm generally lenient about food taste, but this time my threshold was crossed. I tried eating the noodles only and avoided drinking any of the soup, but this strategy was inadequate. I've been to other ramen restaurants that don't go overboard on the seasonings, so I know this place is the odd one out.  Other than that, the place is pretty nice. The menus are easy to understand, even with the ramen + rice + dessert combos. The decorations and the staff are authentically Japanese. Service is fast and friendly. Wi-Fi is password-protected, but free if you ask nicely."}
{"text":"Was walking past Dundas and passed by another ramen place that we wanted to try...it was a major line up. So we give Raijin a try. There was a slight line up but we were only 2 people and hostess asked if we mind sharing a table. We were fine with that so we got a table shortly after.   The restaurant itself had 2 sections front and the back area has more seating and also had an area where they sold Japanese frozen and refrigerated & dried snacks.   Looked through the menu and most of the ramen. If you wanted more stuff in it, then you had to add extra money for the add ons. Since this was the 1st time here, I decided to order the regular with no upgrades (or there was even a downgrade of a smaller size, minus $1). My husband opt for the larger version, so he added $1 for a Larger Size. I ordered the Dark Miso Ramen, which was a Chicken Broth with Smoked Bamboo Flavour. My hubby ordered the Gyokai Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen.   It was really quick service. Not long after ordering, our ramens arrived at our table. Mine was regular, so regular only had 3 very thin slices of Chicken, a bit of Green Veggie (possiblity it was spinach), maybe 1 cup of noodles,  I think some threads of Saffron. The broth was rich and flavourful and noodles were al dente. I pretty much finished almost the whole bowl, just left a little broth left.   I had room so I ordered a Japanese Pudding (can't remember the name), it was really creamy and soft. It tasted like a really soft and extra creamy panna cotta. The pudding itself didn't taste like much, slight sweetness and possibility it we tofu base, with a small dapple of red bean paste, & whipped cream. But I enjoyed it anyways :)"}
{"text":"If you like really creamy soup bases, you'll love Raijin Ramen. However, I'm not a huge fan of really creamy soup bases.  I found the taste of my spicy tonkotsu ramen too rich in cream and less flavorful. I'm not exactly sure if it is because of this one instance or if it's just how the soup is, but I didn't like my meal.   I will say that the service was excellent and we were seated quickly when we came in at around 3:30PM."}
{"text":"I've visited the old Raijin location twice before they moved; this was my first time going to the new location -- it's a bit hidden for those who don't know where it is (I was following my friend lol).  When we got there, they location was actually closed for most of the day due to a water outage (maybe something to do with plumbing upgrades?).  They had tweeted they were opening at 6pm that day, but we didn't actually get in until around 6:30pm (the door was locked, but an employee had come outside to let us know they needed a bit more time to set up).  Luckily it wasn't raining to heavily, so my friend and I just waited outside for them to open.  Due to the water outage, they were only serving their appetizers and some of the ramen (3 types).  When we finally got in, it appeared this new location is much smaller than their previous one, but they kept that iconic statue they had in the new location.  There's also a tiny convenience store near the entrance, but there's nothing really special there -- the prices seemed standard (or possibly a little bit more expensive than J-Town prices).  I got the Tokyo Shoyu Ramen with Egg and my friend got the Gyokai Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen. Both came at the same time, and it was good -- though keep in mind that ramen has a lot sodium... I ended up being very, very thirsty as the night went on.  Adding an extra $1.50 for egg is a bit steep, but I got it anyway because I was hungry.  I'll come back here again later to try out other things they have on their menu.  For now, just be warned that you might end up really thirsty after your meal!"}
{"text":"This is my second vist to this restaurant. Good location. Fast friendly service. A bit underwhelmed with the quality of the noodles both times."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of ramen generally, but this pace is the exception. Love their ramen, the broth, and appetizers. Also, the greeting when you come in an leave is so adorable. I've also bought snacks from the tiny little market they have in the back - love me some mochi and rice balls! So much better than Sansotei."}
{"text":"One of my favourite ramens in Toronto! I always get the spicy miso. The soup is so rich and flavourful and creamy, noodles are chewy, and the pork is fantastic. I always want to drink all the broth but have to restrain to avoid overdosing on my monthly salt intake.  Ambience is warm and lively - you can watch them make the ramen if you sit in the front. Service is fast and friendly, and of course, they shout at you in Japanese when you arrive and leave.  Check in on Facebook for a free topping! The egg is pretty good."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends and a friend told me this was a real Japanese place.  It took a little while to get seated.  I noticed poutine on the menu and was shocked that a ramen restaurant would offer poutine. A friend of mine ordered it and four very small plates about 2x2 inches came for the four of us with a set of chopsticks for each of us. The poutine did not have melted cheese and didn't taste very good at all.  Service wasn't bad, as soon as the servers notice your drink is getting near empty they're very quick to get you another or refill your drink. (Bottomless drinks are not offered at this location)  The ramen was okay but nothing special, I ordered mine with chicken and the chicken broth. The broth tasted disgusting, similar to Karen's experience - the broth tasted watered down. Seaweed and an egg - for the side - the egg didn't look appetizing at all, I skipped eating that.  The bill wasn't rushed and overall it wasn't a great experience.  2/5 - the extra star is for the service or else it'd be a 1/5.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Spicy ramen is awesome, and their takoyaki appetizers are quite tasty as well.  Pricing is reasonable for a downtown Toronto establishment."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night at around 8. No line so went right in.   Ordered a tonkotsu shio ramen regular with thick noodles. And my friend ordered a charcoal one. I think the pictures on the menu for mixed up for the tonkotsu shio and shoyu. Because my shio didn't come as black as on the picture . Anyhow, I was pleasantly surprised with the soup!! It somehow tasted like Chinese shark fin chicken soup!?!?! The noodles was al dente. The egg wasn't as runny as sansotei. And it only came with one piece of chashu which was a bit stiff and not fatty. Overall I think it's pretty good.   FYI: my fav ramen restaurant has always been sansotei. I feel that raijin is a bit less msg-y than sansotei. It's a little bit ($1-2) more expensive Than sansotei."}
{"text":"We have been Raijin Ramen multiple times - both the old (Yonge/Gerrard) and new (Yonge/Wellesley) location. The ramen at the new location takes much salty than the old location. Menu is also different. There is Tsuke Men in the new menu, which I haven't seen it in other ramen restaurant in Toronto. It is a very special experience as you can dip the ramen in the soup instead of having the ramen soaked in the soup. All other ramens are pretty salty...except the Tokyo Shoyu Ramen. I would not recommend it unless you live in that area."}
{"text":"Everything is good but nothing too special honestly.  If you never had Ramen or if you are into Japan then this would probably be 5/5."}
{"text":"On a cold, winter day, it is always nice to go in and have a hot bowl of ramen especially at Raijin Ramen. The tonkatsu shio ramen was delicious especially the broth. The texture of it was creamy which surprisingly tasted good with the ramen. Also, I don't know if it's just me but the egg tasted delicious! Definitely not your typical boiled egg and I say this in a good way.  The portion was also just right. The other day when I went to Santouka with a bunch of friends, I remember the portions being quite small especially for dinner which was definitely not enough. We had to go out for more dinner/dessert afterwards. Also for those, who do not get full from having just one bowl of ramen, I highly recommend getting the combo with the rice especially the Torimayo Don and salad. I had a bite of my friend's rice and almost ate the whole thing. Of course, I had to stop myself but I would probably order it again the next time I go. Maybe dinner?"}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times since I am a big ramen eater and I also love pretty close to this place. I am only writing a review now because I feel like I can give a somewhat accurate review now.  So I have ordered many things at this place but I do not have pictures for all of the things I have ever ordered. I tried their Gyoza (pan fried japanese dumplings), spicy tonkatsu ramen, curry rice with karage, karage, takoyaki, and I think that's it. I like all of these things and they do a pretty good job at making all of them. I wouldn't say one stands out as being the best in Toronto or the best ever, but they are tasty and good. Takoyaki has a decent amount of octopus inside, not overlooked, crispy on outside and soft on inside. Gyoza are fine, just regular fried dumplings (although my favourite are the ones are Ryu noodle bar on Baldwin). Ramen comes in three different size options (small, regular, large), the ramen is always cooked to perfection, the additional cabbage and bean sprouts and corn and pork they put on it makes the whole dish work really nicely, and the broth i think is terrific too. The curry is good, nothing extremely special about it, it's a good Japanese curry. And the karage (japanese fried chicken) is moist on the inside and crispy on the outside too, it also comes with a side of Japanese mayo.   The broth they have at this place (especially for the spicy tonkatsu ramen, since that's the only one I've tried at this place) is richer and very flavourful. Some people like their broth really light, so if you do I don't think you will like their broth. But I think everyone should give it a try cause it really is good and hearty and very very flavourful!   This place also is constantly on the hunt for new inventive ramen and just today I saw some new ramen thing they are offering in collaboration with some famous chef in Japan I think. I want to give this a try next time.   This place isn't overly expensive and is pretty student friendly in my opinion. Especially compared to all the other places to eat downtown for students, this place is one of the good ones. I'll definitely keep coming back and so should you."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm becoming a ramen snob, but I was highly disappointed by the ramen here. I should've known when something was fishy when I got here at 6:30 on a Tuesday evening with absolutely no line up and countless tables unfilled.  There weren't many selections. Shoyu, shio, or miso for tonkatsu or chicken. I ordered myself the pork miso ramen + an egg.  Broth was a little too \"milky\" (yeah, \"milky\") for my liking, and then the noodles weren't the greatest and really heavy. The vegetables in the broth was a huge disappointment as well. If they have to put napa cabbage in it, then it's not going to be that great.  Disappointed? Very much so. However, if you're looking for a quick fix for ramen, this place is better than Kenzo."}
{"text":"After a few visits to the joint, Raijin has become one of my favourite ramen places in Toronto. I ordered the Gyokai Tonkotsu Ramen with egg. The broth was excellent and made me wanting more. And what good ramen can be without the pork belly. It was one tender piece of pork belly that was so good that I had to order another piece.  Aside from the food itself, Raijin - unlike most ramen places in the city - is quite spacious. Sure, it may not have the charm of small shops like how they are in Japan, but at least we won't have to wait twice as long for a delicious ramen bowl!"}
{"text":"Their Spicy Kiramiso Ramen is good but I prefer Sansotei's spicy tan tan. Santouka is also a better option but a lot more expensive. Raijin is good if you're in the area. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Having been to Raijin Ramen a couple of times, I think this restaurant deserve some mentioning about it. So far, the standard has been set from Sansotei Ramen just a couple of streets away. While Raijin doesn't necessarily compete with Sansotei, it still is one of my favourite ramen restaurants because of it's value and location.  Once you step into Raijin, you'll be surprised at how big the venue is. Often times when I come here as a group, there were plenty of space for all of us to sit comfortably in the dining room. The only gripe is that the back dining room does not have any windows, but a TV will suffice.   The menu at Raijin is both elaborative and diverse. You can choose one of many types of the traditional ramen base, but you can also choose to have it in a combo, complete with rice, salad, and soup. The value of the combo cannot be understated, as it provides a good sized portion of side dishes and ramen for less than $20. The ramen and side dishes themselves were also pleasantly rich in flavour. My favourite bowls of ramen is the Tonkatsu and Spicy Shoyu, both not too creamy and tasting delicious. The ramen toppings are generously provided, and the side dishes were also plentiful for the palette. As for the service, it has always been fast and efficient. The staff is courteous and respectful.  At the end of the day, if you're looking for a bowl of ramen (or even more) at an incredibly good price with great flavour, look no further (and definitely not Kenzo...). This is the place to go."}
{"text":"I like this place (more than Santouka too). You might have some doubts because there is no line, but its good.  Ordered the miso ramen like I do in all the ramen shops I frequent in Toronto. Its nice. Their pork is quite lean compared to the other shops so, it is more dry. As you finish, you will feel a bit nervous. The ramen shop is quite spacious and there is a waitress at each corner of the room, waiting for the right timing to go ask for your bowl after you finish. It is intense. I would come again especially if I do not want to line up. It feels a bit out of the way because it is another block north from Dundas (on Gerrard), where all the other shops are about."}
{"text":"The ramen was alright. I had the spicy ramen and added a boiled egg and black fungus.  The broth was just a tad bit too thick/heavy for my liking, and the noodles a little thick/possibly undercooked?  Spicy was also not spicy enough for my taste, but to each their own and I probably could have just asked for more sauce/chilli oil.  I wouldn't choose to go back if I had the option. Definitely a sansotei fan girl, apart from their ridiculous line ups.  My friend and I went right at 11.30am for lunch and Raijin did fill up fast, I must say. Definitely recommend planning ahead, not sure what the line ups/wait times would be during peak hours."}
{"text":"The noodles were pretty good and the soup as well, but apart from it's competitors, it didn't really speak to me.   The place is big and their way of taking order is through paper menu that you check out .  From the entrance, the space looks limiting but then they show you the back and there's a whole other space behind it for more seating. Oh and the kicker, when I was heading to the washroom, on the other side, they have an in-house Japanese grocery/snack room store. Now that's different."}
{"text":"updated review: their food + ramen is of really great quality now! They've improved significantly from when they first opened and I'm loving everything that I order from them. Notable items: gyoza, pork shio, and chicken shio"}
{"text":"I have a hard time rating this place. It's definitely more than 3 stars (i.e., average or \"A-OK\" as it says in the review form), but I kind want to reserve the 4 stars and 5 stars rating for the really special places. So having said that, this place is good, and I like the ramen there. And each time I go back, I like it a little better. The first time I went here (during lunch time), service was slow. I waited  a while for my food, and I noticed some people waited for theirs too, while some tables got their food, etc. pretty quickly. I figured that's not a big deal, but after I got my food, no one came by to see if I needed water or wanted anything else, etc. And when I finished, I sat there and waited patiently for someone to ask if I wanted anything else or to give me the bill.   Anyway, the lesson I learned is that maybe to avoid them during lunch time! Because the other timees I've gone there, the service was fine! The important thing: the ramen's pretty good. It's hard to compare the ramen here vs. other places in Toronto because I kinda like them all for different reasons. The spicy miso here was particularly good, but so are the other ones. Their happy hour menu is a good deal too: ramen + karaage + drink was like only $10).   Long review short: it's pretty good!"}
{"text":"Man, Toronto has the best lunch deals!  I was in town on a Monday and caught up with two Toronto friends over lunch.  We were craving ramen and since last time I tried Sansotei, my friend had a new place in mind that he really likes: Raijin Ramen.    The place was busy but not too packed, a nice change from most of the ramen places that I've been to.  Spacious is the word that comes to mind and Raijin has a nice, relaxed, modern vibe to it.  We were seated by the big statue and did not have to wait (sweet!).  I did some research beforehand so I knew I wanted to try out the lunch deal. Two of us got the \"Special Combo\" lunch deal and the other ordered a special bowl of ramen.   The Special Combo includes a small ramen, rice bowl and salad (sesame and soy sauce dressing).  Price is amazing ($11.95 for all that). We ordered:  Special Combo #1 -  Bamboo charcoal dark miso ramen (extra $1.50 for this type of ramen + $1.00 to upgrade to regular size).  The broth was very flavourful and had half an egg (cooked perfectly) along with one piece of pork.  Delicious! -  Torimayo don - boiled chicken and mayo, green onions, sweet sauce and nori seaweed on rice. Nothing crazy but a nice, simple dish to compliment the ramen and salad.  Special Combo #2 -  Toridashi shio ramen (chicken broth salt ramen)  -  Soboro don rice bowl - chicken soboro, nori seaweed and scrambled eggs on a bed of rice  -  Tsuke-me ramen ($15 after added extra meat/egg/vegetables) with side bowl of Tonkotsu Shoyu-dare (dipping sauce). This comes on the side and lets you dip your noodles in them separetely.  My buddy only orders this every time he goes.  Go for lunch, awesome deal!  Plus they have a loyalty program where each time you order ramen, you get a stamp for each bowl.  Would definitely go back to check out the other ramen bowls."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday, was sat down immediately. It looked really small at first but when I have visited the bathroom, there were even more seats in the back. I really like the atmosphere and the staff were great and friendly. The food on the other hand was ok compared to some of the other ramen places I've been. The fish broth is ok, although I do prefer beef or chicken. I didn't finish theyre broth like I normally do and the amount of meat that came with my dish was only two slices of pork. The chicken sure dish was much better and added more meat to my dish."}
{"text":"Winter is coming (WAY too early) and everyone needs to ctfd about their pumpkin spiced lattes.  However, as much as I want to deny that this white stuff is lurking around the corner, my body tells me that it's time to put on those sweaters and eat those super hearty hot lunches again.  Gone are the non-existent handful of summer days we had this year - THANKS mother nature.    So normally, I'm not a ramen type of gal but when it's super cold, I do enjoy a bowl of this hearty meal and this warm bowl of goodness really satisfies my tummy.  Raijin Ramen was quite delicious.  We came here around noon time for lunch and we got our noodles really quickly - we were in and out of the place within 40 minutes.    My ramen was very flavourful and the soup base was done just right.  The boyfriend had the pork bone broth and it was equally delicious too.  It was definitely a delicious fall lunch.   Overall, I would definitely come back here.  It was delicious and quick place to eat at and a great work lunch time spot!"}
{"text":"3.5/5  I've tried the big 3 in Toronto, so it's time to take it down a notch. I've known Raijin for a bit now, but never had the chance to try it since I heard mixed reviews from my friends. Out of pure coincidence, I was by the area today and decided to give it a shot.  This place is great if you don't wanna wait for a table a la big 3. The interior space is huge and goes deep in the restaurant; when I arrived at 12:30 the place was only about 3/4 full. Unfortunately that's about it in terms of reasons I would not hesitate in going back.  Service started very good, as the waitress took my order rather quickly. However, by the time I finished my food I couldn't find anyone for a good 15 minutes, to the point I wanted to just leave my money and leave.  As for the food, I ordered the miso tonkotsu ramen in a small bowl, as I wasn't hugely hungry. The cha siu was pretty good, not Kinton standards but better than Sansotei's at least. The ramen was actually very similar to Kinton's, which is okay but I do prefer Sansotei's. However, the broth was the big loser in my bowl, as it was simply too salty for my liking (and I'm pretty tolerant when it comes to rich broth, case and point Santouka).   Considering the fact I accept this place isn't as good as the big 3, my experience here was overall decent. The ramen is passable, with improvements that can be made with the broth being too salty. I definitely wasn't expecting Kinton-level service, and the level I got was decent, but of course it would've been better if I had been attended consistently."}
{"text":"Super delicious ramen, cozy atmosphere, super nice staff that greet you and says goodbye to every patron, fantastic!"}
{"text":"Delicious, filling, hot....these are my basic requirements for ramen which Raijin Ramen more than met. I found the service upon entering to be very friendly and the spicy ramen was quite delicious. For $14 for lunch, overall a very good deal."}
{"text":"I love Raijin Ramen and always recommend it as the ramen place to go. I love their creamy soups and chewy noodles. My only complaint is their egg - wish it was more soft boiled than hard boiled. What's surprisingly good is their chicken karage. It's so moist and juicy and comes out piping hot. I find the servers are always nice and I enjoy that there is space to breathe unlike other ramen places.  ***  ETA: They have changed their menu and sadly no long have their Raijin plate which was my favourite item to order. They also changed their chicken karage which used to use dark meat but now uses white meat and is less juicy. However, their boiled eggs are not as hard boiled."}
{"text":"Noodles has a very strong alkaline water taste. Noodles are under cooked, making them very hard. Soup is tasty. Ehhh not the best I had so far"}
{"text":"One of my favorite ramen spots :) We ordered the Gyokai tonkotsu shoyu ramen (5 types of soya sauce) and the dark miso ramen combo with chicken mayo bowl. It was a hot day and they let me get cold noodles for the Gyokai ramen. They basically separated the sauce and noodles. It tastes better when it's served as hot noodles though. Everything was yummy. The chicken mayo bowl is really good. The jump from their small to medium bowl is huge. So keep that in mind lol."}
{"text":"I meant to write this review a while back.  I dropped by for a lunch last week so what better time to write one now.  Pros: Extensive menu Mix and Match combos  Cons: Portions could be better  I came to this place a couple of times when it first opened and it's very different since then.  They've added quite a bit of items on the menu since then.  The ramen now comes in small medium and large sizes.  Another difference now is they offer you different types of combos to choose from.  There's a dessert combo where you choose a dessert, rice bowl, salad and drink to go along with your ramen.  There's many sub types to choose from in those categories as well.  The combinations are endless.  Other combo options are ramen combo (ramen, rice bowl, salad), dessert set (ramen, salad, dessert, drink) and beer set (ramen, gyoza and beer).  Having all this choice is definitely a good thing in my opinion.  I ordered the tonkotsu miso ramen and my GF got the tonkotsu tsuke-men.  I wasn't too hungry so I opted not to get a combo.  I definitely would of if I was.  The ramen came to our table quickly and hot.  The noodles were pretty good, not the best but pretty good nonetheless.  The star of the show was the broth.  It was by far the richest tonkotsu broth I've had.  It was really think and creamy.  My GF's tsuke-men is a ramen that comes without soup but you get a dipping type sauce to dip everything into.  The sauce was a bit too salty for my and my GF's liking.  You get a very large amount of noodles though if you order it.  One thing that has changed for the worse is the portion size.  It's a lot smaller than it was when I first came here.  You only get one piece of pork with your ramen now.  It used to be 2.  I was lucky I wasn't too hungry but if I was, I would of definitely been disappointed.  I'm usually an extra noodle and extra cha siu everytime I go for ramen.  I would of been at least 17-18 dollars if I added on everything I usually want when I go.  Raijin was one of fav spots for ramen and it still is.  I like how they've added a lot of choice to their menu.  I just know if I'm really hungry, I need to to get the large ramen at least."}

{"text":"The ramen here is pretty good - the broth is super flavorful and creamy but a little too heavy for my taste.  I usually get their miso or shoyu tonkotsu ramen. The noodles are pretty thick and really fills you up! I once ordered a regular size ramen combo (with salad and small side of rice) and almost passed out from itis. I would say that if you're going to order sides or a combo, a small ramen would be enough. Last but not least, you MUST try their poutine with teriyaki sauce!"}
{"text":"Despite the friendly service, neat decor and flexible menu (combos, customizing) the actual ramen here is really average. I was really underwhelmed by the food.. perhaps it was an off day for the kitchen.   They have an open kitchen with poorer ventilation than many other ramen shops--  you will definitely leave smell like food.  Might give this place another try and eat here again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great at Rajin, but first impressions was that the servers didn't seem very polite. We ordered the gyoza to start, was disappointed since only 2/5 were crispy. I ordered the Shio Tonkotsu Ramen in small and they had a fb/ig check in special so I got some pork belly for free. The ramen was so delicious in the beginning, the pork belly melts in your mouth and the cha siu was nice and tender. Texture of the noodles were great and the soup was delicious. But as I got to the lower parts of the bowl, I think I got a huge pocket of baking soda that they add to the noodles - that made my whole ramen taste like chemicals. It was completely inedible and I only finished just over half of my noodles. I was dining with a coworker who loves this place so I didn't bother to complain. They also weren't able to split the bill properly for us, so I was extremely unimpressed by the whole experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very difficult to find. I followed address on yelp and still couldn't find it. But good thing I called the restaurant and was given specific instruction by the hostess, or else I would have really missed this gem. There's a kenzo, sansotei, kinton ramen around Wellesley subway station. But out of all of these ramen places, raijin is my favourite.  The broth is very flavourful. We both ordered the most basic ramen, which is the one menu item that can help you distinguish ramen stores apart. We also ordered extra meat on the side, that came with veggies. Dumping all of these into my ramen is the most satisfying thing ever.   Also, most of the customers who came here on a Saturday are Japanese, so that must speak to the authenticity, right?"}
{"text":"Like any other ramen place, when you walk in, it feels like you are the star athlete and the whole place is cheering for you:) The waitress was very quick to bring our water and menus.  I ordered the miso vegetarian ramen with an egg and my friend ordered a cold beef ramen.  I was quite excited to try the vegetarian broth, however, I was quite disappointed:( I find the broth both too salty and sweet... And the noodles itself is a bit too tough for my taste.  My friend enjoyed the cold ramen a lot, it's a great dish to have on a hot summer night!"}
{"text":"I was very hungry the day I came. it's a little bit hidden. Wasnt as easy to find. The place is very nice, service was ok. I ordered the Assari toridashi Shoyu ramen (chicken broth) and a japanese style poutine. I liked it. Dont know if i will purposely come back for it. I think i just like my spicy miso and tonkotsu"}
{"text":"I went there with my partner and we both ordered a ramen with a rice combo. The ramen turns out to be too oily that pays me and my partner a visit to the bathroom after we go back home. Overall, we both agreed the only pro of their food is the meat quality in the ramen. It is  by far one of the best when compared to other ramen restaurants. However, it is not good enough to bring us back for a second visit.  Please note: They offer a small Japanese grocery store at the back of their store and also bento take out. My partner is tempted to try out their bento in the future. Will posted an updated review later."}
{"text":"Dropping in for a quick lunch between classes, this small ramen joint is fairly busy. Our waitress was a bit of an airhead. We order two Tonkotsu Shio Ramen, I may have butchered the name but made sure to point out the dish in the menu. Yet the waitress brought us two orders of another ramen. It wasn't a big problem as she quickly took the mistaken dishes back the kitchen and we didn't have to wait very long until our corrected orders arrived at the table. At the time I did have a it of a cold but both my companion and I felt like the ramen wasn't anything special. Personally I felt like the broth was good but the pork belly was a bit tough to break apart with my chopsticks and the noodles were a tad on the bland side reminding me of instant ramen noodles."}
{"text":"After so many let downs from other ramen shops in the city, I must say I've really enjoyed both of my experiences here. It was super spacious, no wait times, clean washrooms, and the service was great. Raijin has chosen a prime location for both students and hungry shoppers from the Eaton Centre.   What we ordered:  Tonkotsu Karamiso Ramen (spicy miso flavoured) + egg - $10.50 + $1.50 Tonkotsu Miso Ramen + egg - $10 + $1.50   Unlike other places, their portions are large and the regular size bowl of noodles were very filling. Your options are small or regular, and you can add extra noodles for $1.50.   Considering the number of ramen options that Toronto has amassed within the past few years, I wouldn't put them at the top of my recommendation list, but tied with Ryoji Ramen & Izakaya for the number 3 spot. Their noodles were nice and chewy, which I liked, and veggies were plentiful, but I still favour Sansotei's egg, and their creamy and rich broth is unbeatable. On the plus side, if you can't stand waiting in line (in some cases, out in the cold) for a bowl of noodles, then I'm sure Raijin will be able to seat you faster than any other ramen shop nearby. This place is underrated. I'll be back.  My ramen soul searching continues ...  Parking - street Hours - 11:30 am - 11:00 pm Vegetarian options available"}
{"text":"It was my second visit to Raijin on a Wednesday at 12 p.m. Unlike a lot of other ramen places around Ryerson, there was no line-up, which was great. A lot of tables were open since lunch basically just started. Raijin is also located very close to College Station (about a 5 minute walk).  For both of my visits, I came with a friend. It's much easier to grab a spot if you have about two people. I decided to just get the regular-sized Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen. The broth was thick and creamy, so there was a lot of flavour to it. The noodles also had a great texture and were not overcooked. Although I do disagree with some Yelpers below that Raijin gives the same amount of noodles as Kinton; this not true. As someone with a big appetite, I definitely would get extra noodles if I wanted to be more filled up or perhaps even order a large size. Unfortunately, Raijin only gives one piece of meat, unlike other restaurants that give two. I was also a bit disappointed since the meat had a lot of fat to it as well. My friend ordered the Tonkotsu Miso ramen, and felt that this was also a disappointment for her as well. However, the meat did have a good texture, but it didn't exactly melt in my mouth. I'm also a really big fan of soft-boiled eggs, but I would've preferred it if the yolk was more runny, like at Sansotei.  I did get the ramen combo during my first visit, and I remember that it was pretty filling although it only comes with a small ramen. The rice bowl was a nice addition to the meal and the salad had a nice dressing on it.  The service was pretty average. The server provided us with water without us having to ask for it. Our ramen also arrived pretty quickly.  Overall, although the ramen did taste good, I felt that it was more ordinary compared to other notable restaurants like Sansotei, Santouka, and Kinton. I would definitely come to Raijin again if I didn't want to wait in line during a busy lunch or dinner period. However, I would visit the other ramen restaurants around the area if I had time to spare."}
{"text":"I used to adore this place before it moved north off Yonge. Went every couple of weeks. But when it moved a couple of months ago, it also changed the menu, paring it down dramatically. My three favourite dishes disappeared. It's one thing to change location, but when you change the menu at the same time, it becomes a different restaurant. So disappointed. I won't be back, sadly. Idiots."}
{"text":"Pretty huge selection of ramen. So far, Tonkotsu shio and shoyu are my favorites. I love it!"}
{"text":"The main menu is still the same, however Raijin have changed their combo over the past years - most likely to accommodate students. My friend and I decided on the dessert set, which consist of a small ramen; salad; dessert and coffee/tea/pop for $14.50.   -Tori Shoyu Ramen:   I got the chicken ramen and the overall ramen is flavorful, not too salty and the broth is clear! I don't understand how chicken ramen at Kinton or Touhenboku is always oily and rich, I felt like I was drenched in oil after having their ramen. I also liked how the soft boiled egg is not an additional cost in Raijin. At other ramen restaurants, they always charge extra for the egg and since it is an essential ingredient for ramen, I always get the egg even when it's extra...sighs.  The noodles was a bit different than the normal ramen and I actually enjoyed it. The noodle is more chewy with a rougher texture, similar to Ryu's noodle bar but that's just my preference lol. Chicken was soft and tender, and HOT, which is unlike the Kinton's version.   -Cheese cake This cheesecake isn't like the Japanese cheesecake where it has a fluffy and sponge-like-cake texture. I thought it was okay, the cake was a bit dense and those 3 dots of raspberry sauce on the plate were a bit awkward lol. What am I supposed to do with it? Why not pour the sauce on top of the cheesecake, or at least give me more sauce on the side!  -Tonkotsu Shoyu Ramen:  I didn't get to try this, but friend said the broth was not oily and very creamy. He also preferred the Kinton's cha siu over Raijin, as at Raijin the pork meat was a bit tough and didn't have that nice seared on top like Kinton :(.  -Coffee Jelly:  The bottom layer is a milk pudding, which is really sweet but it had the layer of dark coffee jelly to bring down the sweetness. I actually liked this dessert as it was a refreshing way to end the meal after a heavy bowl of ramen :).  -Raijin Poutine:  The Japanese poutine is a bowl of french fries with some cheese curds, drizzled with a teriyaki mayonnaise sauce and topped with some seaweed. I used to like this dish, however the quality have gone down.. I mean, look at those blocks of cheese curds, they didn't even melt at all, this cannot be called a poutine!! The fries are decent, not greasy and still soft on the inside with a nice crunch.  Overall I found the food quality of Ramen Raijin have declined over the years. With the abundance of ramen joints around the area, there are simply better options out there to have a hot bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"So I just accidentally came across this restaurant today. It was pretty chilly in Toronto that's why I submitted and thought that I should give it a try.   Tried a different broth this time, I guess it was chicken broth. It gave a different flavour compared to the other pork ramen that I have tried in the past. It's not that flavourful, but it tastes good.I also tried their version of a pork bun, it tastes good but the meat was kind of dry and too thick, I believe.   The service was great! The servers were very attentive and at the same time, I like the concept of an open kitchen.   Hope this review can help =)"}
{"text":"Really a wonderful place for Ramen.  Given how many ramen places I've visited over my account on Yelp, you'd figured I would get sick of it, or have the whole \"well they all taste the same\" syndrome.  Nope.  This place is excellent and my only regret is I wished I knew this place a lot sooner.  It's at the intersection of Yonge and Gerrard, where it's also near a place where it's near and dear to my heart (psst...it's Kaiju Curry, go there!) and surprisingly accessible (I had this odd idea that it was really far and out of the way).  This ramen place is actually pretty spacious, where there's a front and back of the room of this ramen place and yet it was still pretty busy overall, a friend and I barely got a table for this.    The menu, it's actually laid out really well, where they offer few bowls, but offer a variety of combos, and different sizes.  I went with a Ramen combo, Tonkotsu Shio Ramen, and it came with salad and a curry rice bowl.    I have to say, if I have to rate the experience and the taste of the food.  These guys have the potential to be the absolute best in Toronto. And overall, I highly enjoyed the food overall, so the following will sort of be minor nitpicks but I think these guys can take #1 position easily.  I'll start off with the major positive.  The broth.  I don't think any place has nailed a broth so accurately like Raijin, there's a creamy taste to the broth, and it's nowhere near salty as the other reviews are suggesting.  If you want salty, I can name other places that you can go to, but I won't do that.  They...NAILED that broth.  It's tasty but not salty and the taste itself isn't overly aggressive, but it's really wonderful.  They unfortunately didn't nail the softboiled egg...I could easily separate the yolk (even it was semi liquidy) from the actual egg white, so while it taste great, the running yolk wasn't all the way there.  On top of that the noodles, as much as I like al-dente noodles, dare I say it, they were a tad slightly undercooked, like maybe 30 seconds longer in the boiling water.  Again, I want to make this clear, these are minor nitpicks and does not take away that as a whole the dish itself was DELICIOUS.  They cut up the black fungus in little strips, which is my preference, because I'm normally not a fan of it, but I found myself enjoying it here, as well as the cabbage that was incorporated in the dish.  Overall, yes, minor nitpicks, a solid solid dish.  Heck, even the salad and curry bowl were delicious too and deserve to be noted here.  Service is wonderful as well.  They're pretty attentive and despite it being busy, they're quick thinkers and always have a smile on their face.  Thought that was something I wanted to point out and thought it was pleasant to witness.  Overall, I'm conflicted.  A lot of ramen places are just simply stepping up their game and this one is definitely on my radar for good, excellent ramen.  While ramen grows more in popularity, I implore you guys to give this place a try.  Over and out."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of Japanese friends when we decided we didn't want to lineup at the new Santouka (where I'd already eaten).   I actually got the lighter, clear chicken broth rather than the usual tonkotsu, because I wanted something lighter and the waitress recommended it. I wasn't a fan -- way too plain! Everyone else in my group got tonkotsu pork broth though, and the general consensus was that it was just okay. Common criticisms seemed to be that it's not as rich or flavourful as it should be. If ramen is normally too strong and shiokarai for you, you might really like it though, as one of our group did.  The inside is pretty big, so the nice thing is you probably won't have to wait for a seat."}
{"text":"I came here on opening day for lunch with my vegetarian friend (who, incidentally, has written a review for this restaurant before me). Decor was beautiful and light.   I love the large open windows and single bar-style seating they have. The open kitchen, where you can see the chefs cooking, is a great authentic touch. My friend and I were seated at a booth table and we really loved the way the staff were friendly and engaging. Very awesome to walk in amidst shouts of \"welcome!\" or \"irrashaimase!\" (Japanese for welcome)  We ordered tonkotsu shoyu ramen. Unfortunately, no vegetarian-friendly options available at this restaurant, but perhaps they will add it in the future! Gyoza is very affordable as well.  The noodles were chewy, the soup was filling and flavourful, the beansprouts crunchy, and the tonkotsu was delicious. I didn't finish my whole meal and it was definitely very satisfying, but soup was a little too rich for me. Compared to other ramen places in the area, I find that you get more value for your money at this restaurant.  I just hope that this place stays! :D Definitely a must-go for the cold winter months coming up! Everyone thanks you as you leave, so you know you're really appreciated!"}
{"text":"This was my first stop here after landing in Toronto for vacation. We ordered the Poutine de Japon fries and chicken karaage for appetizers. The chicken karaage was perfectly crispy on the outside with a lot of meat on the inside. The Poutine de Japon was definitely a very Asian/Japanese version of poutine. It was basically fries topped with seaweed, mayonnaise, and a soy sauce based sauce on top. Both were quite delicious!  I got the tonkatsu with spicy miso ramen with extra toppings and boy was I stuffed after the meal. I liked the spice level of the soup. It wasn't nearly as spicy as some other ramen soups I've tried but it had a rich quality to it that paired well with the noodles. The pork was tender and they were fairly large pieces. The corn was an added plus for me because it's not often that ramen places add corn without making you pay extra for it.   All in all, a very filling and delicious meal and a great opening to my visit in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner here with a good friend, we're big ramen fans and are always up for trying a new place. I ordered the Spicy Tonkotsu ramen and she ordered the Gyokaitonkotsu Shoyu ramen. We also got the gyoza as a starter. And to our surprise, there was a drink special; $3.50 for a pint of Sapporo, so got that as well!   A tip for everyone coming here is to CHECK YOUR UTENSILS before using them. I casually pulled a spoon out to use with my ramen and as I turned it to dip into my soup, I noticed half the spoon still had old rice stuck on it! Couldn't throw it away fast enough. Good thing it didn't touch my soup yet!  Now onto the food. The gyoza was pretty average, nothing overly special. The ramen I found wayyyy too salty. Great idea to get the beer with it. In terms of the toppings, I found the meat to be a bit overcooked dry. It otherwise only had sprouts and cabbage, not sure if they forgot corn (cause it's in the picture). The noodle texture was good, chewy, cooked just right!   Probably will not make a point to return. I think their competitors have beat them out in terms of quality. For their price for a bowl of ramen, I expected a decent meal, but overall was not wow-ed. If you're in the area and looking for an average bowl of ramen with no line up, this would be an ok place."}
{"text":"Quite enjoyed our experience here. Came on a Saturday and it was busy. But wait was only about 10 mins or so. Btw I had no idea how big this place was. Very spacious tables. The staff were very efficient and friendly. The ramen came very quickly.   I ordered the regular Tonkatsu Spicy Miso Ramen. Loved everything. I had asked the spice level to be not too suicidal spicy so it was still edible and it was perfect. Loved the soup base as it was a bit creamy. I kept drinking and drinking it... even though I should have stopped as it's probably full of MSG. Sodium overload !   There were also combos with small ramen, rice bowl, salad for around $14/15. Pretty decent deal.   I would totally come back again!"}
{"text":"Decent ramen restaurant, but I find the majority if their ramen to be too salty. There new location is quite convenient, with lots of light on the summer. They also have a mini shop to purchase Japanese snacks"}
{"text":"Nice decor, tasty ramens, friendly staff. Overall a great place to hang with your friends and close ones and enjoy some Japanese..."}
{"text":"I found this hid away restaurant when running away from a rain on a cold spring day. The place is nicely lit with ambient light and is warm enough to make me feel cozy and relaxed. I ordered a tsukamen (hot ramen with dipping sauce). Good presentation. Generous portion. The noodle was thick and perfectly chewy. The slides of pork shoulder melted on my tongue. My only complaint is the dipping sauce which was very salty ... and sweet ... and sour. Imagine mixing one spoon of salt with one spoon of sugar with perhaps half a spoon of vinegar and put it on your tongue. Hmm. It's literally mouth watering. Lol. I drank two whole bottles of water afterwards. Now going for my third bottle."}
{"text":"Been here twice. This time I had to wait for more than 5 mins before getting seated although I am by myself, and the place is literally empty bc it is Sunday of a long weekend. There are like 100 employees here and everyone excelled at looking away. Brilliant.   The noodle is OK. I liked the richness of their pork broth, it is not too too salty like some bad bad noodle place, but still wayyyyy saltier than what I need. If the kitchen resorts to adding more and more salt to bring out the flavor, you need to go home. I personally much prefer sansotei, they are just more professional about it than these diletanttes."}
{"text":"Ramen Raijin has relocated to 24 Wellesley West, hidden in a small residential street at the back of the building of Rabba's convenience store. I came here on their opening weekend.  The new location has a nice open space, with communal style seating in the middle and tables around the sides. Overall it is smaller than the old location, and can now only accomodate around 40 diners. The menu has also shrunk a bit and contain only the more popular items from before, but I was assured that their summer cold ramen noodles will still make an appearance (Whew! Those were my favorite).   This location also has a mini shop selling drinks, desserts and snacks, but the shop is smaller as well. I can't help but think this little shop area would be much more useful as additional seating area, as I hardly see anyone buying anything from there. The items on sale are available elsewhere, so there really isn't any reason to be both a restaurant and a super mini convenience store at the same time.  For this visit, I ordered the Tokyo Shoyu Ramen, which my waitress said was her favourite. It is a more classic style of ramen and they do an admirable job at it. Personally, I found the broth just a tad too salty and did not finish off the soup like I usually do at my favourite ramen shop. I remember this being the case as well on their take of my favourite style of ramen - the tonkotsu style ramen, where their broth was just a tad too overwhleming. Having that said, I know that this saltiness level is perfect for others.  I think Ramen Raijin can definitely improve on their pricing, as there are some pretty competitive ramen places out there that either give more generous portions of toppings, or is a dollar or two cheaper. Expect to spend just under $20 after tax and tip for a bowl of ramen with 1 or 2 additional topping (usually egg and extra meat are my go-to's)  Despite being at a new location, the staff were seasoned enough both in the dining room and the kitchen such that food arrived quickly. I was also happy for them that it was packed on their opening night, so clearly they have a very dedicated following who loves what they do and offer.  Overall, Ramen Raijin is a fine place for a good bowl of ramen and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Been here before but first time trying the Tonkotsu Spicy Ramen, I ordered a small and added an egg.  The soup was creamy, flavourful, spicy but not so much that you wouldn't be able to drink it. The noodle was cooked al dente, the egg was between soft and hard boiled (set but tender yolk), the chasu was decent but there was only one slice.  I also tried a small Karaage (3 pieces), it was meaty and slightly on the chewy side.  The meal was not bad but it was overpriced for the amount and taste they offered."}
{"text":"Excellent ramen! Excellent staff! I went there after lunch time on weekday but it's crowded inside. Gyokai tonkotsu shoyu was excellent. I loved it!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and forgot to post a review. Had the spicy tonkatsu ramen today and it was very good. I got it without noodles (I am on a strict diet) and extra egg and canola. I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Woo hoo Raijin!!   I am in LOOOOVE with this spot.   In a world with so many ramen places, why is this one my favourite?  1. Excellent service! The servers are attentive but not obtrusive, and kind of adorable.  2. Ambiance! What a cute little place, and I never have to wait for a spot! I usually end up sitting around the bar around the totally random statue, which I love. And by little place, I mean this place is actually huge but they normally have one section of it roped off - I assume they seat people there when it gets busy!   3. Food! Their ramen is excellent and everything is always cooked to perfection. Everything I've tried is so good and all the flavours are really distinct - all of the broth options are great!   4. $9.99 PITCHERS OF SAPPORO ALL SUMMER LONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Number 4 is clearly a highly influential factor, but honestly this place is so great I'll continue to go after the beer special ends!"}
{"text":"Raijin is finally open after almost a full year of being under construction! I finally make my way down to the restaurant after being so lazy and I must say, I'm really impressed with how the place is laid out and the kitchen looks to be very organized. Might I also note that there is a nifty little \"grocery shop\" before you walk in on the left.  I ordered the Gyokai Tonkotsu Ramen with extra pork belly cha-shiu (i typed up this review as I'm eating and forgot the name, sorry if it's wrong!) and received the bowl less than 10 minutes after I ordered. As expected, pretty quick since there were only 2 other people in the restaurant. After eating half the bowl, I noticed the noodles are great, chicken is very soft, pork is nice and firm, but the broth is creamy and has a lot of garlic. Not really a fan but this does make or break the review in giving it a 3 or a 4 star review.   My friend ordered the Hokkaido Miso Ramen and says it is good with nothing else to follow.  To end off, Raijin was NOT a let down. No reason to deduct stars and no reason to make it a 5 star Ramen place but I will give it a 4/5 since the service is great, servers are polite and I do like the atmosphere of the restaurant. I also want to note that my ramen was a bit more expensive than Kinton, which I gave a full 5/5 star."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is good. I just don't like their tab water. It's a nice place for a small group of friend. But if you make reservations ahead, they could accept bigger group too."}
{"text":"I came here to try the spicy tonkatsu ramen with the egg, and I wasn't disappointed!   The flavours were so rich and the soup base was very creamy. The texture of the noodles were perfect and chewy. The egg was seasoned very well and was a great topping to the noodles. The soup could've been spicer but it had a good kick to it.   The only downside was that this ramen place is extremely pricey compared to other places like Sansotei and Kinton.  It was $17.20 before tax for my ramen with an egg (its $2 less without the egg).   If I were downtown, I'd still make an effort to come here because the flavours were on point!"}
{"text":"Pretty good meal special. Definately very filling. Although I didn't like the broth too much. Lots of seating but a bit squished. I like sitting where you can see the cooks do their majic. And he food came pretty wuickly after ordering."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my friend. I've been here a few times but with so many other ramen joints around, I'd give this a try.   Food came very quickly so idk if they were pre made. I ordered a regular shoyu ramen where my friend ordered the shio. My noodles slightly aldente and the soup base can do with a bit more flavour. Towards the end, the soup base got a little more salty. What was a little disappointing was that there was only one piece of meat; I would have preferred to have more or at least in thinner cuts.   They have a huge statue in the middle of the room, which isn't always the best cause they can maximize floor space better, plus I like to face in front of the person I am sitting with during my meals. They do have larger tables though for groups of 4ish. Wifi doesn't work ughghghghgh. They also use a stamp card loyalty points system.   Great for students especially for lunch!"}
{"text":"One of my top ramen places in Toronto. Usually there is no line up (even durinf peak times). This place is fairly big unlike most ramn shops are small. I like they have hooks around for your jacket if you sit on a stool seat. I do find prices are a bit high compare to other ramen places. Service is sometimes really good or alright (sometimes you do need remind them fill up your water)."}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTING!   I have tried the best ramens from Tokyo and some ramen here in Toronto and their spicy ramen was just okay for me. It was not that spicy, noodles are good, pork slices are good, but too OILY for me.   There was so much oil floating on my bowl. I seriously don't think the ramen needs that much oil. I haven't seen that much oil in my ramen in my entire life, only here at Raijin Ramen."}
{"text":"Great ramen with really fast service. It's a great option for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Try it last night with a shio noodle. Kind of disappointed on it.  The soup was not hot, and a bit salty. But the noodle was slightly under cook."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite ramen places in the city. Having tried a ridiculous number of ramen places already, I always come back to Raijin. My staple has been a large spicy shoyu ramen (large is $1 more).  The soup is flavourful, thick, and has just enough kick. The pork is expertly torched. The noodles are just chewy enough, and take up the soup well. Another favourite is the Pork Shoyu Ramen: the soup is very good. If you do drink the soup, remember to hydrate after as you will be super parched later on.   In the summer, they have a $9.99/pitcher of Sapporo which an amazing deal, so bring a friend. They honour their \"Buy 10, Get 1 Free\" cards, and let you combine multiple cards (something that other places refuse to do); and these cards don't even seem to expire anymore).  Service is super friendly and the staff are super cheerful. They are quick and attentive, so it's always easy to get what you need. Also, there is a ton of seating so you will never have to wait too long (or at all). Ridiculous/amazing wooden thunder god statue in the middle of the restaurant too."}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed in their ramen. The broth and noodles were ok. I felt weird in the stomach 30 minutes after I had left the restaurant. Perhaps other dishes on the menu are worth a try, but I would not be back for ramen, that's for sure. I'd rather go to Ajisen Ramen next time, since it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this ramen spot near my house, but slightly disappointed. The prices are a lot higher than the average ramen spots I go to. The flavor was meh, I don't even remember which I got but it wasn't special. They added some chinese spinach in one of the ramen bowls which was a weird top off..  The spot is hidden so it was hard for us to find but the service was okay"}
{"text":"well well well... still a good place but their almost constant efforts to give it a more modern touch is ruining the concept... the back room is simply awful, unnerving loud TV constantly broadcasting hockey (who cares in a ramen restaurant!!??), combo menus everywhere and the staff there is blandly not attentive to customers anymore.... the food has not improved... whereas they were close to the same quality as the father-place in Vancouver, they are going again backward... Sadly but surely DOWN on the list of ramen places in Toronto..."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for lunch today, because I found out that they have Tsukemen on their menu. So I wanted to give it a try.  My husband had their bamboo charcoal chicken ramen and the broth was quite tasty. A big improvement to when we first came when they just opened. The noodles were also not overdone like before.  I was given a choice of cold or hot broth for my Tsukemen and of course I went for hot. It is winter out and freezing cold! I needed something hot for the warmth. The broth had a nice thin layer of fat, and the broth underneath was piping hot. I love the touches of seaweed and greens on top of the noodles unlike santouka which you only get a plate of noodles. But don't get me wrong, I love santouka!!  Overall, my husband and I was glad to have given Raijin Ramen a second chance. So we can see their improvements and of course the service was amazing. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I noticed they have more menu options than other ramen places in the area, like more ramen offerings and multiple combo options. I chose the dessert combo with tonkotsu shio ramen and the gojicha pudding, which also came with a drink and salad. The ramen broth was pretty creamy and the noodles were decent but what I liked most was the pudding! It was only mildly sweet but the dollop of red bean added a touch of sweetness that balanced it out nicely."}
{"text":"The new Raijin is better than the old location. I love their new summer special yazu cold noodle. It's fresh and opens my appetite.   Their rice ball is good too. Better and cheaper than h mart. Good for take out and I rather get raijin rice ball than timmies bagel for lunch now."}
{"text":"UPDATE: After a year of ramen soul searching, Raijin has come out head and shoulders above competition.  What can I say? I eat a lot of ramen and there's a lot of competition in Toronto these days. Given that the standard's pretty high, it's futile to differentiate between the \"best\" bowl or ramen in town because at this point, you're splitting hairs. Toronto has matured beyond the usual Tonkotsu Shoryu broth (still one of my faves), and Raijin offers numerous tasty broths from chicken to black miso.  So what has elevated Raijin into my coveted 5-star club? VALUE! VALUE! VALUE! Their ramen bowls are way more reasonably priced than their competitors and their lunch combo is, quite possibly, the best thing ever. From 1130 to 1500, you can get a small ramen, small rice bowl and a salad for $12. YOU. CAN'T. BEAT. THAT. They also have a stamp card - you get your 11th ramen bowl FREE!  Coupled with some great side dishes (their CHAR SIU PLATTER is meat heaven, and I would recommend getting this instead of paying for extra meat if you're really hungry).   And finally, because they have so much space, YOU NEVER HAVE TO WAIT. When it comes to ramen in Toronto, the best ones are the ones you don't need to wait for."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my partner.   The dining area is nice - some private booths with some big shared table areas. It can get quite loud (not in a bad way) as the staff greets those coming in and exiting the restaurant. Good and friendly service.   We ordered Tsuke-Men ($13.50) and the Tonkotsu Miso Ramen ($12.25). I wanted to try the Tsuke-Men because the soup is separated from the noodles so it doesn't get soft as it sits in the broth. The soup was definitely too salty! Adding water to the soup made it better. The Tonkotsu miso ramen was better! The noodle were delicious but we didn't think the soup and pork slices were anything special though. For the prices of these, we will likely try other ramen shops next time."}
{"text":"I walked by Raijin Ramen on a Sunny Sunday afternoon... With no line up and I was not full, I know I want a ramen!  The decoration here is nice and spacious. The staffs here are plentiful and friendly. I counted 10 wait staffs but I do wish they are more proactive as a lot of them were just standing around not too sure what to do!  The kitchen though was really slow. It took longer for them to cook my ramen than the time it took me to eat it?! That's long...... Hope when they worked out a system soon as it really don't need 5 cooks in a small space trying to cook some ramen?   Noukou Tonkotsu Miso Ramen ($10) + Soft Boiled Egg ($1.50) - The most expensive Ramen on the menu but has the least toppings.. - The milky broth was lukewarm when served and cooling down faster while I was eating it! Though it is rich and not overly salty! - Noodle though has great texture and bite, the star of the ramen - Pork shoulder a little dry and really thinly sliced - Portion wise it is great!   Hopefully Raijin Ramen will improve over time. Hotter broth for winter? or Maybe I should try the Chicken Broth?  Slurp!"}
{"text":"they increased their price now, if you trying to order Tempura curry rice just save it, came with 4 little Tempura with sticky rice and lot of sweet curry, not worth $13.50 for that, you can buy ton of Tempura from Metro for $10."}
{"text":"While I am not a ramen connoisseur, Raijin Ramen was recommended by my friend's Japanese Registered Massage Therapist/Acupuncturist, as the best ramen in the neighborhood.   Slurping loudly is one of pleasures of indulging in ramen! It is a sign of respect for the chef's hard work and dedication.   I ordered the Dark Miso Ramen ($9.95).  Unfortunately, it did not induce as much slurping as I had hoped.It was saltier than I would have preferred. While the chicken broth was not as creamy as it's rich tonkotsu counterpart, a hint of smoky bamboo flavour did came through. The chicken cha-shu was juicy and tender.  Kara-age ($4.30) was decent. It was piping hot. Perhaps it is the potato starch to flour ratio, it was not as crisp as other restaurants.   Raijin Ramen earned some respect after I sampled my friend's Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen ($12.25). It was very slurp-able. The broth was rich, smokey, and creamy. No wonder it is the #1 best seller at Raijin. My friend ignored the advice from her acupuncturist and puts her life at risk (grossly exaggerated) by ordering spicy ramen when she was cough excessively. Judging from the satisfying look on her face, it was well worth it.   Who can blame her? Salty-spicy goodness with sweetness from the corn to balance the savoriness of the broth - slurp away! Any food lover would have done the same! I will be back for the Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I used to swear by this place. It was my go to ramen and I would go once or twice a week. The last couple of times I went, it was horrible.   The waiters forgot about our table, which yeah it happens. But we were literally waving our hands trying to get someone's attention. After the table next to us got their food, ate and paid, and after we waved at them a couple of times we finally ordered.  I got the bamboo charcoal chicken ramen because I have been feeling health conscious lately. It was not very charcoaly and I swear the cook must have been in love or something because it was the saltiest ramen I've ever had.  So so disappointing. This place used to be great and now it's really gone downhill. So, now I'm looking for a new ramen joint. Any suggestions?"}
{"text":"Raijin Ramen is yet another ramen spot in a sea of competitors in Toronto. That's its biggest downfall. There's just so many great ramen restaurants that being okay isn't enough. I got the spicy ramen with extra pork. The pork was pretty delicious although a few pieces were almost cold. I'm not sure if that was a mistake or that's just how they do it. It was decently spicy, but the broth was crazy salty. Like salty enough that I couldn't drink the broth which I usually like to do. Also, they don't offer noodle customization like some other ramen places. The portions are huge though and the service is friendly and very efficient. They also offer a lot of good combo options where you can get a rice dish, dessert and drink all in one. It's a good spot for a quick bite but don't expect the best ramen in the city."}
{"text":"Extremely salty!!! Every Ramen I tried is extremely salty. I live close to the place and gave it so many chances to impress me. It turned out not the way I expected. I guess it's a good place for Ramen noobs because it's so flavored with salt and strong soy sauce."}
{"text":"I came here around 1:30pm on a Saturday and it was pretty busy. We were seated quickly at the bar. I had the miso based ramen ($15 w/ egg, 13.5 w/o egg) and the karaage to share ($.8.50 for regular size). Food came out really quickly. The karaage was really good but I thought the portion was a little small for the regular size, I can't imagine how bit the small size would be. The ramen was unlike ramen I've had before. I was a little disappointed with the soup as it was really watery and corn heavy. I liked their egg a lot and that was probably the best part of the ramen.   Overall, an OK experience but there's definitely better ramen in Toronto."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I waited 40 minutes for my order... Normally, I wouldn't be upset about waiting but I was on my lunch hour then, so I was pretty upset. Second time around, the wait time wasn't too long. The ramen is good and comparable to santouka. Price is very good, one of the less expensive ramen places I've had. Would come back but definitely not during lunch hour around 12"}
{"text":"This is probably my 4th time at Raijin Ramen and each time have been different. I love the Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen (Pork belly), and their selection appetizers.  They added more seatings, or I have never seen the back room before with a huge TV. I have always sat outside with the giant statue and the open kitchen. They provide such a unique Japanese experience such as when we leave, they thank everyone for coming each time. It takes hard work, dedication and commitment for them to bring together such a well balanced bowl of ramen.   I love the corn to balance the spiciness of the Tonkatsu Ramen. Definitely will come again!  If you do come to this place often, they have a loyalty card that offers a free Ramen after 12th or so Ramen bowl you buy."}
{"text":"Ramen Raijin (@ramenRAIJIN), another Vancouver ramen emporiums Kintaro and Motomachi recently open following Santouka (see my post here) which is another Vancouver favorite.  Named after the god of thunder, Ramen Raijin occupies a much larger space compare to the other ramen joints in Toronto.  Gyoza $2.50  They offer both tonkotsu (pork bone) broth as well as in the rarer toridashi (clear chicken) broth in shoyu (soy sauce), shio (salt) or miso flavours    Noukou Tonkotsu Shio Ramen $9.50 ~ Pork Shoulder, Green Onion, Canola Flower, Black Fungus, Cabbage, 1/2 seasoned soft-boiled egg & Housemade Black Oil Toku-Mori +$3.00 ~ extra Pork Shoulder, Pork Belly, Nori Seaweed, Seasoned Bamboo Shoots No steam coming up from the bowl when it arrived which is a terrible sign, major points are taken off when soup is not pipping hot. Then I thought there was something odd tasting but not sure what it is and since I'm not sure what black oil is, I am assuming it was that.     Bamboo Charcoal Dark Miso Ramen $11.00 ~ Pork Shoulder, Green Onion, Bean Sprouts, Canola Flower & seasoned soft-boiled egg + $1.50 for Seasoned Bamboo Shoots  This is their signature ramen, it is believe that bamboo charcoal absorb toxins from the body when it goes through the digestive system. Not sure how this was suppose to taste but it was on the sweeter side and lukewarm once again.   Verdict : While it wasn't bad, it wasn't memorable and nothing memorable/stood out to us plus the lukewarm temperature that it's been serve doesn't help either I don't think I'll come back anytime soon"}
{"text":"There's nothing like ramen for a cold rainy day! There are so many ramen options downtown now but I would highly recommend Raijin for the following reasons:  1) they take reservations! Most ramen shops are tiny and walk-in only, but Raijin actually takes reservations and can even serve large groups! I came with a group of 13 and they were very accommodating.  2) good menu selection- besides all the yummy pork soup based ramen, they also have chicken and vegetarian options for those with dietary restrictions.   3) the ramen is delicious! I've tried a few different kinds of ramen here and they were all scrumptious. The soup is thick and flavourful! I would definitely come back to try their dipping ramen.   Highly recommend- especially if you are not a fan of waiting in line!"}
{"text":"Walking to the restaurant late at night was sketchy AF. I really don't understand why it gets so eerie north of the Eaton Center. Anyway, would I risk my life again for ramen at Raijin? Most likely not.   The inside of the restaurant was quite spacious and clean, and includes a mini convenience store near the back as well with Japanese snacks.   I ordered the dark miso ramen and my friend had their tonkotsu ramen. So glad I didn't order that tonkotsu ramen, it was extremely salty and my friend kept downing glasses of water. The dark miso ramen tasted ok. Seems like all their ramen dishes lack ingredients. My ramen came with 2 small slices of pork, ramen noodles, and onions, and that was basically it. Everything else was charged as an add-on and they don't have much options either.   Students, don't get lured into coming here! I know they have a buy 10 get 1 free stamp card but the price really doesn't justify what you're getting out of it!"}
{"text":"Summary: nice ramen with good portion Tip: social media checkin could get you a free topping. Also, remember to get point collection card.  I went to this new location with my friend after pride parade. This new location is a bit hard to find. However, the renovation here is clean and the staff is friendly. I like the noodle and booth here. I order the Spicy Tonkotsu every time and I still like it. My friend ordered a large bowl with extra noodles, it was a big portion. I recommend this place if you are in the area and want to have a big meal."}
{"text":"Great service, good but average food.  I want to like this Raijin, but it was more or less an average experience.   SERVICE - Excellent!  As you come to expect from a Japanese restaurant, my friend and I were warmly greeted and shown to our seats. Ordering was easy, and the food arrived quickly, even with several other customers dining at the same time.  The staff was very accommodating when I asked for the chicken breast to be replaced with char siu pork.  As we exited, we were also warmly bid farewell. So the atmosphere was great!  FOOD - Average...  We ordered the following, for a total of $37 after tax, before tips.  1. Bamboo Charcoal Miso Toridashi Ramen. Broth and noodles were both nice, and portion size was perfect when I ordered Small. Now, that char siu pork I ordered earlier... It actually was very bland. It was hard to chew, but most importantly, lacked seasoning. 7/10  2. Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen. Pretty good, not overly spicy, and not super greasy or salty either. To be honest, saltiness seemed fine for both ramen. 8/10  3. Salad. Fresh, but lacked dressing or flavour. I guess I'm more used to the basic cabbage salad, so this Spinach and Egg salad was interesting, but bland. 5/10  4. Takoyaki. Good, but nothing outstanding. I do appreciate how the octopus chunks are larger than at other places. 7/10  5. Chicken kara-age. Not bad, but the mayo... I guess it's an in-house mayo? It tasted different than the usual Kewpie Japanese mayo I'm used to. Again, bland. 6/10  Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the food (except the char siu pork, which I think Ramen Isshin makes the best), it's just not spectacular.   The Bamboo Charcoal is a must-try though, because you can't get it anywhere else in Toronto, as of writing.  Overall, the place is pretty good, probably HEALTHIER than some other places in terms of salt content and freshness of ingredients, but I found flavour to be lacking for several dishes."}
{"text":"With the exponential growth of ramen joints in the city, this one remains one of my faves.  ATMOSPHERE: Your typical modern Japanese restaurant set-up. Clean, contemporary feel. I love that it's larger than all the other ramen joints in town - which means NO lines! And the general spaciousness makes for a better dining experience in my books. It's really a big plus for them versus other ramen choices, where space is very limited and peoples elbows or chopsticks are constantly in the way.  SERVICE: Friendly and efficient. Food served at a good pace.  PRICE: Average. Ramen bowls range from $9.50 - $10.50. Appetizers and desserts range from $2.50 - $7.  FOOD: I was here with a friend, who had recommended this ramen joint as one of the best. It doesn't have her absolute favourite ramen - BUT seating is almost guaranteed because it's a larger space than most ramen bars that only fit up to 20-30 people.  I shared the:   1. Kara-age: LOVED this! Thick juicy pieces with crunchy skin. 3 pieces for $4; Large is $7.  2. Poutine de Japon: Very tasty. Fries topped with cheddar cheese curds, teriyaki sauce, mayo, green onion, nori seaweed.  3. Tonkatsu Ramen with shoyu broth: So good. Highly recommended.   On another visit, I also tried more appetizers:   4. Fire Crackers: six deep fried cheddar sticks (wrapped in wonton skin) served with choice of honey, ketchup or salsa. Meh. I'd pass.  5. Gyoza: 5pc for $2.50; 10pc for $4.50. These were tiny but delish.   I've definitely been returned for more ramen, and will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Rich (yet not too salty) broth, chewy and stringy noodles (with a mild odor), gracious (and salty) pork portions. Quick and courteous service with relaxing ambience. If you can overlook the somewhat over detailed and redundant menu, then you'll find an overall authentic and delicious ramen bowl"}
{"text":"The noodles and soup aint bad! Love the fact that it's roomy."}
