{"text":"Ice milk popsicles are great.  Pina aqua fresca is fresca.  Oh, and they have fresca.  The Fresca from the 70's.  The Mexican version.  It is a sketchy area, so be careful.  You'll be offered an iPhone in the parking lot."}
{"text":"My favorite Paletas! If you're looking for good Mexican paletas and desserts this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"good selection of paletas, also has ice cream, licuados, mexican snow cones, cockteles de fruta, as well as tortas. I've only had their paletas, which appear to be made on the premises. the pecan one was great!  I only wish there were more people here.  in the right location in the right city, the store would be booming."}
{"text":"Not as good as the original in Mexico, but as good as it gets for the USofA.  Great paletas."}
{"text":"I will never go back there again! I was heading over to get some elote and when we was pulling up into the parking lot, my boyfiend and I got hit by a truck. The guy refused to hand over his insurance and took off, little did I know the guy owned the store and only came back because I called the cops. He the worst person to deal with and he claimed he didn't even hit us when there was definete paint transfer!"}
{"text":"Best place for raspados  anytime of the year.  Plus you can't miss Carnival Mirror.  Place is clean."}
{"text":"Great place to stop by and grab an ice cream with the kids. It definitely beats other ice cream spots. The prices are not too bad, depending on what you get. I got the strawberries and cream or in Spanish Fresas con crema. They were delicious! No too sweet. They can also add different toppings like shredded coconut or granola, I chose not to add any. I will definitely be back next time I'm on this side of town. Oh, they don't only have ice cream. They have other goodies like raspsdos, Aguas Fresas, fruit cocktail, shakes and tortas."}
{"text":"Best elote in the cup I've had in town!!! The staff was very polite and helpful too. Definitely will be going back, they have a huge selection of treats."}
{"text":"So yummy! The diablito and tornado are delicious! I would totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love everything they serve at this place EXCEPT FOR ONE THING THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE. The ladies that work here should atleast have a smile on their face. Other than that the food is good the place is clean and neat."}
{"text":"Place looked a little sketch outside but one you got in it was clean and the desserts were delicious!"}
{"text":"Just meh. I went for a diablito because I didnt want to drive to 59th ave  & McDowell. What I got cannot even compare to what I usually get at other places. The ice was like chips and there wasn't cacahuates or all the other mexican candies. I can't speak on any other menu items, but I probably wouldn't return considering there are water and ice and raspado places all over the city."}
{"text":"A relaxing place to sit and fulfill a sweet tooth.. Or even a snack. The elote has a different type of cheese that's really good. My bf enjoyed the fruit... The lady was sweet and the environment was chill. If I lived In Phoenix I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Raspados were not tasty. The space is large so that's a plus...I would be OK not returning. The service and food we ordered were below average."}
{"text":"Loved this place. They have all sorts of Mexican chucherias aka Snacks. Price is great and the quality of service was too! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Upon reading reviews on raspado \"shaved ice\" my curiosity lead me to this place. Originally was to try the one located in Mesa but was in the west side so decided to try this place. The two raspados I tried were delicious. I had the mango and the gf had the strawberry raspado. Not that sweet but enough to hit the palette. Would recommend this place to anyone that is in the area."}
{"text":"I love going here with my friends, I still have to bring my boyfriend here one of these days so he can try some good Mexican ice cream, a diablito, or fresas con crema. All the desserts here are great, I haven't tried their food yet, but i'm sure that just like everything else it must be great."}
{"text":"Scoops of heaven. Staff was polite place was clean, service with a smile. Ill be back."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has no reviews!  I found it on Yelp when we were on the other side of town and craving some helados.  They had lots of Mexican desserts on the menu and on display to get our mouths watering.  We chose ice cream and strawberries with cream.  The ice cream was really good,but the strawberries and cream was one of those desserts that I will never forget!  Amazing!  The vibe in the place was very casual and very cool with murals all over the walls and families hanging out and enjoying hot food and desserts.  We can't comment on the hot food, because we didn't try any.  But, we would love to go back and try and of course, save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Great place. It was exactly what I was looking for and have yet to find a place that makes these treats as well as them. I got the Mango Diablito but they have a variety of stuff to choose from and a nice seating area for you to sit and enjoy your treat with whoever you take or by yourself haha"}
{"text":"07/01/10  After my overall disappointing meal (had high hopes after reading rave reviews) at Tortas El Guero, I decided I'd check out the ice cream here- thanks to the recommendation of the TEG server.  Again, the Mexican rep behind the counter didn't speak English, so it took awhile to convey my wish to try a couple of flavors before settling on one (she kept asking if I wanted the flavor in a cup or a cone!).  I was at the point of giving up and just walking out when she finally figured my question out...  Both flavors were so good, I really had a tough time deciding!  Ah, but I do love coffee ice cream, so...  I still dream about the coffee here, so a return visit is in order very soon!"}
{"text":"This place has fairly price deserts. Haven't tried many of their dishes but I tried a \"mangoneada\" and it was delicious  would come back to try different treats!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They were so friendly and the restaurant was so clean! I had the elote and It was fresh and so good! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Since arriving to PHX I have been exploring my local barrios for a location to get some of my favorite Mexican treats.  As I was rolling on 16th, I saw the sign...now if you blink you miss it.   I usually look for the big purple Dulceria across the street first and slow down as I near.  It is located in a strip of buildings that have seen better days, pero yo no tengo miedo.  I have stopped in 3 times to date.  On my first visit I picked up un grande Agua de Pina (Pineapple \"water\") and a few Paletas, fresh fruit/fruit juice popsicles (coco, pina, sandia y limon).  While the selection and the quality is not as extensive as one of my favorite places in Albuquerque (on Central just south of Coors) .  I have to say it is close.  At least my Agua de Pina was fresh and not the hyper yellow processed stuff I get sometimes at Pro's Ranch Market.  On this visit there was also a lady inside selling fresh hot homemade tamales for $5 a half dozen.  *Score*!  On my second visit I went in for another batch of paletas, and this time I also left with 2 Aguas Medianas de Limon y otro de Pina.  MmMMM....I liked how the Limon was still quite tart and just sweet enough.  The Pina I put in the fridge for later.  I also decided to try a Raspado de Mango (Mango snow cone) to which I allowed the addition of a little Leche Condesada/Azucarada (Sweetened condensed milk).  Not as much mango flavor as I was expecting but refreshing and tasty with nice little pieces of fresh mango.   I need to go back to try the nieves/helados (ice cream), and  Escamochas (mixed fruit served with coconut and drizzled with sweet condensed milk or sometimes honey and sprinkled with granola or pecans, usually fixed up to taste) or the Pico de Gallo (in this case it is a plate/cup with a combo of any of the following like cucumber , watermelon, canalope, honeydew, pineapple, coconut chunks, mango, jicama sprinked with red chile and served with lime wedges).  They also offer some baked items like bolillos, pan dulce, and other pastries."}
{"text":"Best raspado in the PHX Ã¡rea, in my opinion. Decor could be better but it doesn't take anything away from the raspados."}
