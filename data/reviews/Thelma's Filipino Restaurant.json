{"text":"Hubby and I love this place and a regular haunt for us.  My Hubby's fav: adobo fried rice and spam musubi.  My favorite: pinakbet and Thelma's special.  This is a must try for anyone craving Filipino food."}
{"text":"The food was fine and the staff was friendly.  I got a pork and pumpkin dish and it was really juicy, tender pork with slightly crunchy pumpkin slices.    The lumpia were pretty small... about the diameter and length of my finger."}
{"text":"I literally had the best breakfast in my life here.   I've traveled a good portion of the world and I have been to all 50 States.   Until I had the chicken adobo garlic fried rice with two eggs over easy at Thelma's, I've never had anything so good for breakfast. I normally dislike rice but this rice is different.   I ate here several times over my week in Vegas and I will definitely do so again."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!!! It's anytime food. Best service from quality and genuine people! If you don't try it you will have bad luck for a whole month!!(Jk;))"}
{"text":"This place is very clean and has a friendly staff. Our favorite was the sisig. Too bad they took it off the menu. Their sinigang and lechon kawali are delicious."}
{"text":"Best Filipino restaurant I've found so far. Yes the white rice portion was smaller than I wanted, but my waistline doesn't need more either.  Have been craving food like my Lola made & I finally found a place to get that fix!  Will definitely be back when I'm in town"}
{"text":"This was my third and last trip to Thelma's. I waited about 40 minutes for an order of garlic fried rice and banana lumpia. This was due to what appeared to me to be a lack of organization in the kitchen - where the cooks were cooking orders one at a time instead of trying to stack them or figure out how they might efficiently cook the orders. Not worth it. Never again."}
{"text":"I LOVE Thelma's! The food is absolutely amazing and the customer service is great! I'm not a big fan of filipino restaurants...the portions tend to be small and the quality of service is not that great...but Thelma's has been the best filipino restaurant I've ever been to. It's simple and casual, but high quality. The food is delicious, and the people are nice and friendly. I've been to the location in Hawaii, and both of them are good, but the service here is better!   The restaurant is deceptively not easy to find, even though it's practically across the street from the Station Casino. It's basically in the back of the shopping plaza, so you don't really see it when you're driving down the street. It has a nice and simple decor on the inside, with a tropical hawaiian-filino theme going on throughout the restaurant. When you enter, you wait in line and place your order and pay, and then they cook the food fresh and bring the food to your table. The menu is posted above the counter, kind of like Jollibees, except the food listed on it is way better. ;) One thing about it is that some of the dishes lack a full description, and because I'm not filipino, I don't know what a lot of it is. However, the friendly staff at the counter is more than happy to help you order. One time I was even offered a sample of the pork guisantes because i wasn't sure if i wanted to order it. It ended up being my most favorite dish at Thelma's!  My favorite dishes are the pork guisantes, which is pork and peas cooked in a tasty seasoned tomato sauce; mongo beans (the BEST mongo i've ever had), which is mung beans cooked with lechon in a rich, but light and flavorful sauce; and of course Thelma's special, which is chunks of lechon (roasted pig) with fresh diced tomatoes and onions in a soy and vinegar sauce.  Everything else I've had there is also quite tasty. That includes the shoyu chicken (chicken braised in soy sauce), kare kare (oxtail with veggies in a peanut sauce), adobo (pork or chicken braised in vinegar and soy sauce), pinakbet (mixed vegetables like onions, green beans and bitter melon), and fried rice. ALL OF IT=DELICIOUS!  Great food, good portions, reasonable prices, and excellent customer service makes Thelma's a great filipino restaurant. I believe this is a pretty new location, so definitely check it out!!"}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent. I haven't tried too many Filipino restaurants but this place is right up there close to being number 1. I had the three entree plate, it being dinuguan, beef and tripe soup, pinakbet. It wasn't very pricy."}
{"text":"good eats if ya like filipino food from hawaii...."}
{"text":"I don't know what's the hype about . We didn't like the food and Price doesn't justify the food as well."}
{"text":"When my parents come to town, this is the Filipino restaurant I take them to. I come at least twice a month anyway. The pork adobo and fried lechon are my standby orders, and the flavors are always consistent. The Thelma's special is good too. The food comes within 10 minutes of ordering. It's not gourmet, but it's not buffet either. It tastes like how I recall most of the Filipino potlucks I've been to--like my Auntie's cooking. It's easy to get to in a little complex in the Sunset Station parking lot. The dining area is blah, but the Filipino food is the reason to come anyway."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!!!!! The fried pork is an orgasm in your mouth!!!!!! Everything is wonderful, I haven't had this good of flilpino food since a friend!! You must go here"}
{"text":"Awesome adobo fried rice!  Thelma's Special, a must try dish!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty far from the strip but so worth it. Our entire family went there for lunch and we were so glad we did.   We've been to several Filipino restaurants while in Vegas, and this is by far the best. We ordered and shared the dishes family style: pumpkin guisado, lechon kawali, sinigang, oxtail soup, adobo fried rice, garlic fried rice and bangus.  The pumpkin guisado was everyone's favorite. I'm still craving it now as I'm typing this! Of course we were curious about what our parents thought, since my mom was taught to cook by my auntie who went to culinary art school. She loved it and appreciated how the food wasn't so oily like it is at most filipino restaurants are. Dad proclaimed that he has never been so full in a good way in a long time.   Hope to go back to this location or the one in Hawaii!"}
{"text":"This is some good Filipino food. Kare kare, adobo fried rice, and Thelma's special. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Good Filipino food.  If I lived closer, I'd go here instead of others.  They also have t.v. The staff is nice and friendly.  Great portions that we had to pack to bring home.  Come dine here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife's a chef, and sometimes gets off too late  to make the filipino food she used to make for us. Thelmas is a great alternative for real home style filipino food with a touch of Hawaii food. Service is awesome too. Definitely stop here for any meal of the day."}
{"text":"Thelma's Special is a must try, so ono, just like the Waipahu, Hawaii location.  The food is great, location is clean."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and for lunch it was only $10. Service was very good and the place was clean. Overall happy with lunch. Food was simple and could have been a little better, but I'm satisfied."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place got good reviews.  We stopped by for lunch and waited 40 minutes and did not get our food. They were so disorganized sending plates to the wrong tables.  Our plate was last at a table for ten minutes and then the waitress bought it to our table we refused to take the order. We left without eating and wasted an hour.  Would not recommend. Don't go"}
{"text":"I was craving Filipino food today but lazy to cook it myself. I found this place and it did not disappoint. I got the Kare Kare, one of my favorite dishes. It was creamy, had plenty sauce, and plenty of oxtail and vegetables. I will be coming back to try more of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Had the mix plate with thelmas special ( roast pork with chopped tomatos and onion with a soy sauce) it was alright , needed some punch vinager or some kind of acid. Pork giusantes; stewed pork with peas and pimentos and tomato very tender and flavorful my favorite of the three, also had the pancit very thin rice noodles , good flavor.  Overall it was good  , nice  portions and flavorful if in the area would not hesitate to stop by , but would not make a special trip like I did this time . Service was friendly and prompt"}
{"text":"Food is good.. Service not so much.. If you want to add food on your table you forgot, you have to stand up and wait in line again for it to get ordered and settled.."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a year now and their food is fantastic.  The local Hawaii twist to their Filipino food keeps me coming back. The food is not too salty or oily.  I absolutely would recommend anyone and everyone to visit this place if you are looking for delicious filling Filipino food to eat."}
{"text":"Went to Thelma's Restaurant in Henderson and I their food is sooooo good. If you're skeptical about going to a Filipino resto I recommend you try Thelma's.   Well worth it. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Best Filipino food in town. I come here when I want good island food. The prices are reasonable and the wait is never long."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Filipino food at Thelma's! We had the pancit, lechon, and adobo. The breakfast there is by far my favorite! Everything for breakfast is awesome! I could eat here every week!"}
{"text":"Very good food! I always get the same meal every time which is pork adobo (their chicken adobo is good as well), pancit, white rice and mac salad. For dessert banana bread with coconut ice cream on top, yum yum!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here once before and was very satisfied, but yesterday did a take out order.  I had the pancit and mongo beans.  OMG===horrible. Pancit was ok but mongo beans tasted like soap. Made me gag.  I think Elena's is sooooo much better."}
{"text":"Thelma's special plate for lunch with the in-laws. It was good, but heavy on the onions; had to separate out about half (and some are a bit raw - fine if you like onion flavor). And if they don't ask, tell them if you want rice & mac, or all rice - I wanted mac, but got all rice."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars except one time I was there my order was forgotten. I ordered a simple breakfast plate and got it 45mins later. people after me got their food way before me. other than that I love this place. the owners are very nice. they know me by name because I go there so often. I definitely recommend this place to all my Filipino friends who needs a good \"home cooked\" meal. adobo fried rice is my favorite :)"}
{"text":"Thelma' s has never failed me. Been here many times especially for the fried pork (yum yum) and for Mark it's their lechon kawali (triple yum). Their service gives them the five star. Great food great service what more could you ask for !!!!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place. They overcharged me at the cash register for rice. Adding $6.99 to my meal , which included rice  , I ordered the Moco Loco.   I questioned the price and the lady had to get another person to verify my order. Then they corrected it.  When the meal came it was not all that tasty , very bland.  For $7.99 plus an upsale of garlic for $1.75. I felt it was overpriced and under flavored."}
{"text":"The reason I rated this place a 3-star is because for the price I paid is comparable to the one in Hawaii, but the difference is it's not a buffet.  The food is as awesome as the one in Hawaii. If you wanna try Filipino, this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"Thelma's special (lechon kawali with diced tomatoes & onions), adobo rice with egg topping, bangus sisig satisfied our palates."}
{"text":"Halo halo is one of the well known desserts for Filipinos. As I sat here and mixed my halo halo together I noticed that it consisted of nothing but ice, milk and a teaspoon full of beans and jelly. Talk about stingy. The Toron was ok. I wish I would of just driven to jollybee I swear it would of been worth their 5$ halo halo instead of this 5.99 halo halo that was probably the best ice and milk combo \"Filipino\" restaurant."}
{"text":"I come here every other week. The food is always good and fresh to order. Unlike some restaurants where the food sits there for hours like a buffet. Here, you order your food at the counter, pay, sit and wait for a few minutes, then a server drops of your food & drink. :) The only item I don't care for is their \"turon\" fried bananas wrapped in lumpia wrapping. The banana was too ripe...eek!, it tasted funny. I just threw it away. Every other items on the menu is pretty good."}
{"text":"Oahu, Hawaii's long time favorite & family owned filipino restaurant finally comes to Vegas! We were so excited once we found out this was opening up close to my home in Henderson.  Food is as good as it gets BUT i must say... not as great as the Hawaii's location.  But i'm still a fan! I guess it all depends on the cooks.... The Thelma's special is what their known for which is THA BOMB!!! the portion... not too much for $8 but it's STILL sooo good when you wanna satisfy that craving! I've been craving pork igado for awhile living in Vegas & out of all the filipino restaurants out here, they had it! It all depends on who cooked it though to be honest. One time it would be soo good & perfect & another time it would taste totally off. Unfortunately on my recent stop here, it's not on their menu anymore.  I asked the lady (who always took my orders since it opened btw. Super nice & bubbly filipino gal) said it wasn't too popular so they took it off their menu.  Too bad because all they needed to do was work on the recipe & it woulda been totally popular.  Restaurant is always clean, they serve you, & the workers are really really nice. Not once did I ever have any workers act like they didn't wanna be there.  A must try for all you Vegas locals for your filipino cuisine.  Oh! Another dish to try is the adobo fried rice. So gooood..... There's actually quite a bit that's good. You won't be disappointed. =)"}
{"text":"My son and I have different opinions about this place.  he thought it was outstanding I thought, so-so.  they need to be more descriptive on their things, for us people who like to try new things but, aren't filipino.   I had Thelma's special.  a little to fatty for my taste, my son had pork adobo he loved it.  it looked to scary for my taste,.  The macaroni salad was so thick I wished I had gotten 2 scoops of rice.  again my son liked it. so I'm giving it an A-ok I would of said 2 stars but, he pushed for three."}
{"text":"First time trying Filipino food, and \"yah, I'm a fan.\"   My dad let me pick the restaurant tonight, so I turned to yelp and it came through!   We tried the pork adobo fried rice and the Thelma special=a fried pork pieces with this fresh salsa thing. It was good. I would get both again and recommend others to it!   I wanna try the pork pumpkin soup next time. And there lunch special looked really good. something like a dish, drink and fruit salad for around 7 bucks"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends for lunch and found it to be decent. A lot of the other Filipino places in the area tend to be incredibly oily, but I found Thelma's to be a little less greasy. They have a pretty well priced lunch special that comes with rice, an entree, a drink and fruit salad. The fruit salad isn't anything special. I ordered the pinapaitan lunch special since I was craving some warm soup! I wasn't too impressed as it was a little bland and not hot enough. I did have some of my friend's sisig and would definitely come back for that. I'd say this place is hit or miss, but can definitely satisfy a craving for Filipino food if you choose the right menu items."}
{"text":"Ok.  I have seen 3 owners at this location.  I think this current owner is my favorite.  Place is clean, doesn't feel greasy and the owner is behind the counter and holds a very good conversation.    I had the pancit and the sisig.  Both were flavorful and not overly greasy.  They had a very good selection of food behind the counter.  Servings are generous.  Price is right too.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is the slowest restaurant i have been. Im the only customer and took them 30 minutes for 2 orders. Really??? Food quality is not great why taking u so long??    Will definitely never come back"}
{"text":"Stopped by here because we saw a yelp check in deal. We ordered the Lechon Kawali to share. Seeing that it was around $10 we figured it would be big enough for the both of us. Wrong! Our order came out and it was 4-5 pieces and a scoop of rice. The lechon was cold and hard. Maybe I'm just used to Cali filipino food because everyone rates this place highly or maybe I just came on a bad day. but I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"Worst Filipino food I ever had in Las Vegas! Slow service, rice was cold and hard. The Palabok was very bland. The pinakbut was under cooked and only had ginger as seasoning. The canned coconut juice & Lumpia were good."}
{"text":"I stopped by the restaurant based on the great reviews. I ended up order the trio of the chicken adobo, Pork Gisantes, and a lo mein style noodle item. I found that both meat items were cooked very well technically, i.e. they were fall off the bone level tender/stewed. However, I felt that all three items were very bland and one noted. Nothing had any excitement, and I feel that the meal was a giant let down in the end. I really wanted to like this meal, unfortunately it was simply unable to deliver."}
{"text":"Food was just okay. Chicken adobo had no flavor. I'm going to Filipino Fiesta next time I'm craving this type of food."}
{"text":"This place is just Okay .. there's nothing special about their food it's just mediocre."}
{"text":"Great food! Loved the pansit and the chicken adobo. Tasted just like my filipino buddies family dishes that I've had at parties. Nice clean restaurant and friendly service. Large dishes and much more bang for your buck then most restaurants. $21 got me 2-3meals worth of food and a drink."}
{"text":"In order to find Thelma's Filipino Restaurant, you would have to turn right from Sunset Road, drive all the way to the back of the building, and it's facing directly toward Sunset Station Hotel Casino. The restaurant looks clean and spacious. They have pretty floral décor on every table. And when you dine-in, you can watch TFC which is The Filipino Channel for music, show time, and entertainment. They have an extensive menu that includes a selection of meat entrees for pork, beef, chicken, seafood, and they offer soup, noodles, mixed plate, vegetable, and a few of the more popular Filipino desserts like Halo Halo and Banana Lumpia.  I ordered Tocino Chicken ($9.99) which is sweet marinated boneless chicken thighs, and also requested Garlic Rice ($1.75). The Tocino Chicken came with slices of raw onions. The meat portion is plentiful and the food looks savory and appetizing, however the chicken itself taste rather chewy. I'm under the impression the chicken is boneless, but I end up biting into some surprising bones found in the meat. And that does not taste good. Now the Garlic Rice taste okay, it is so light that you can hardly taste any garlic. Honestly, I prefer if they added a little more garlic to actually put flavor in the rice. When you eat raw onions with Tocino Chicken, you get a crunchy, chewy texture and a strong unappealing taste. As for beverages they have a soda fountain. And the lemon water is free, you can get unlimited refills.   Primarily what is disappointing is the service. The person who place my order is not friendly or welcoming. When I walk into the restaurant, the person just stared. I end up greeting the person \"hello.\" The place is empty and I feel awkward dining in. I really want to enjoy the food, but I just didn't feel any good vibe about this restaurant."}
{"text":"I could eat here every single day! The prices are cheap and the food is always huge portions! The ONLY reason I give it 4 stars, is because of how far out of town I have to go just to get here !"}
{"text":"I loved how friendly the girl behind the counter was! I didn't know anything on the menu and she was a great help! The place was very clean and a decent set up all around. However the food didn't blow me away... as a matter of fact... I barely liked it. However, being a chef myself, I must say the food was all cooked very well and I can definitely see it being someone's taste, just not mine. I will go back to try other items on the menu. Hold for the update..."}
{"text":"As soon you come in thru the door you will feel welcomed. Place is operated by a great staff which works very hard to take care of their customers.The food is awesome and very reasonably priced. I recommend trying their signature dish The Thelma's Special.Its so addictive I come in at least twice a week to just get myself a fix!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on Saturday after Thanksgiving, we had been to see the Roger Waters show of \"The Wall\" and were hungry.  We met Lor, one of the daughters of Thelma, and a more gracious host you could not ask for.  We all ordered our favs from the Menu and Lor and company suggested some things and we took their advice.  All was so yummy.  Sunday was time to head back to the Bay Area and we decided to stop at Thelma's again because we were so happy with our choices the day before.  We also decided not to order the same items again even though we were happy with them.  This time Lor was at the order desk and this time we ordered more items off of the item, so here is what we ordered and loved.  Dinuguan (Angelo says this is so yummy, me I cannot get passed Chocolate Meat), Pork Adobo ( I say this is the best ever, and could only get better if they added a hard boiled Quail egg), Pancit Bihon so good I had to steal some.  Lumpia Shanghai was fried just right!  Not too greasy, not underdone, I loved it but more importantly my 8YO Niece loved them more, so much that she ate most of them with out asking if it would be ok, once she did, there were no more left.  I had to order two more orders.  All of the *-silog dishes were so dang good, I even had them make a Spam-Si-Log  as I am a big fan of the canned meat.  Crispy Spam, with garlic rice, tomatoes, and I am a happy man.  But I have said that before.  Add to this that they carry Manny Pacquiao articles and have become a new distributors of MP stuff means that if you wanna get your Pinoy on, near Vegas, this is the place to do it!  I love this place and give it 6 stars, 6 hearts, 6 whatevers, this is the place!  Aloha,  Dave  Oh, and the Halo Halo is so yummy!"}
{"text":"If you have cravings or just too lazy to cook at home this is the spot to go. Food is close to home cooked meal and service is great. I would recommend this place specially to those who haven't tried Filipino food."}
{"text":"Family run, clean authentic Filipino food that hasn't disappointed the few times I've been. Not greasy, fresh made to order. Had a mixed plate combo with Thelma's special (crispy roast pork, onions & tomatoes) Would be even better with less onions. And pancit. Upgrade your white rice to garlic rice!"}

{"text":"Delicious Filipino food. Located close to our hotel :) I didn't expect it. For great prices too."}
{"text":"Probably the best Filipino food I've had in such a long time! The pork blood and chicken adobo and the local style macaroni salad was awesome!"}
{"text":"Came to Thelma's Filipino restaurant for an early lunch. I came really hungry. As we were the first ones to walk in, we were greeted hello.   We went with Thelma's special which was two scoops of rice and pork deep fried in pieces with onions and diced up tomato. Not impressed with this but more impressed with the four item combo we got which was Pancit, pork gisantes, pork shoyu, and pork adobo with rice. The Pancit was flavorful. Everything was good that I sampled. So delicious. The lumpia Shanghai was good too. My fave was the pork adobo. It was tender and soft. One of the best. Other places leave food under the heat lamps which makes the meat hard. This place makes your food fresh. For dessert, I went with halo halo special which has milk, shaved iced, sweet palms, Jack fruit, ube, and leche flan. I love this dessert and it sure hit the spot. I was full with this. The only issue with me was they give you two small scoops of rice. I love my rice and need it to accompany my main dishes but overall the food was good! My daughter and hubby had coco nana which was banana bread with coconut ice cream on top. I didn't sample this because halo halo was all mine.  Service was great by our waitress. She was also taking orders up front. You can have your food to go or dine in. I enjoyed dining in because they had TFC (The Filipino Channel) on. Very entertaining while you eat. I would definitely come back here to eat Filipino food if I was near the area."}
{"text":"The spouse is a Filipina, and she tends to be quite critical of Filipino restaurants serving stale or old food.  I have to admit, I have come around to her view on this matter.  Many Filipino restaurants have the food pre-cooked and out for the diner to see and select.  Thelma's food is fresh.  It's served hot and delicious.    So far, we've ate breakfast and dinner at this restaurant.  The breakfast was a large serving of fried rice with spam, bacon, and sausage mixed in.  It also had an egg, cooked to order.  The cost of the breakfast was about $5.00.  They also made fresh Kona coffee for $1.50, with delicious creamers and sweetners.    For dinner, we had Sinigang Pamapo and Thelma's Special.  Thelma's Special was crispy pata with onions and tomatos over the top.  It was delicious.  The chunks of pork were crunchy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside.  The Sinigang Pampano is a sort of sour tasting soup with vegies and a good sized Pampano cut in three pieces.  I left the sour soup to the wife, and focused on the Pampano...quite fresh and delicious.  The meal came with lots of steamed rice.  I don't think either dish cost more than $9.00.   The banana lumpia was okay, but not exactly my thing when it comes to desert.    The service is attentive.  The value is there.  The place is clean.  You also get to view The Philippino Channel on a Plasma TV.  Make the drive to Henderson, everything here is much better than Goldilocks."}
{"text":"i want to say it was hard to find but maybe i was a little off lol but anyway the adobo was simply amazing....i would definitely go back if i was on that side of town....!!"}
{"text":"Another Yelp success story!  Rented a car to go to the Hoover Dam and wanted to take advantage of the rare opportunity to eat off the strip and that's when Thelma's came up in search.  The pick 2 combo was a fantastic deal. I got the adobo chicken which was just heavenly - very tender and flavorful. I also took some yelp advice and ordered the Thelma's special which was small pieces of crispy pork skin with a with tomato and onion sauce that worked surprisingly well.  Overall very impressed with the food, friendly counter service, clean/spacious restaurant, and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food here is good.  On both two visits, I've had the combo plates.  The combo plates are enough portions to make you full in an instant.  The prices are reasonable and the Thelma's special is a must try.  It's a far drive for me to eat here, but if ever I'm in this side of the neighborhood, I'll stop at Thelma's again."}
{"text":"Good food. I'm a white boy so I was a little scared. I had the fried pork with vinegar and garlic sauce. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"I'm sad to have to give this place 2 stars.  I drove about 20 minutes out of my way to get here based off of the ratings.    The place was clean and kind of quirky.  The menu had a decent amount of choices to pick from.  However, the amount of food you get verses the price is kind of slim.  Also, the amount of fat on the adobo I ordered was extremely high!  About 40% of my \"meat\" was fat that I had to cut off.  For people who enjoy eating the fat that might not be a problem but for me that's way too high!  I, also, do know that it's more traditional to leave some fat on the meat in Filipino cooking but 40% is still way too high!    My daughter ordered the shiyou chicken and got 2 thighs and 2 scoops of rice for around $5.50.  I, personally, don't really consider that much for $5.50.  The amount of chicken was just ok-for that price I'd have expected something more meaty like a breast or a thigh and a drumstick but it should have also had rice and some sort of vegetable to balance it out.    One thing that I did like is that they skimmed off some of the liquid fat that's been rendered from cooking on top of the adobo sauce.  The meat that we both did get to eat was flavorful too.  Otherwise this would have been a 1 star rating.    Maybe I just went on an off day with the adobo-I hope so!"}
{"text":"Driving 15 miles to come here for Thelma's special is worth it, in my opinion.  It is the only dish I have tried so far.  The hubby (a fellow yelper) and I both love it and since we are not big eaters, we usually just get that one dish and share it, along with their generous serving of white rice.  Location is great! If you feel stuffed after a big meal, go to either Sunset Station Casino or the Galleria Mall to walk it off!  =)  To Roger T., thanks for the advice! Will definitely check-in to get 10% off on my next order!"}
{"text":"Being new to las vegas area i found this hidden gem across from the sunset station casino. ordered the oxtail soup which was very good, tender, had lots of flavor. Their lechon kawali was cooked  to perfection :-) crunchy goodness. I love how their a cook to order restaurant. everything was fresh. will be back again. i ordered to go but the staff was very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"You would think that they would do a better version of Shoyu chicken because they are from Hawaii. I was very disappointed.  The chicken was lightly seasoned, barely any soy and not sweet at all. I almost thought they served me adobo."}
{"text":"Updating my review from my last experience ... I'm impressed .. Food was good, service was good ! I guess you can say I'm glad I gave it another try.  Thelma's Special is my favorite .. New item we tried is the Longanisa Musubi! Which was D E L I C I O U S!"}
{"text":"My order, every time:  Appetizer: Shanghai Lumpia Entree: Mixed plate of chicken adobo, pancit, white rice and macaroni salad Dessert: banana lumpia special (the one with ice cream)  I'm drooling as I type this...so delicious. This is the only place I'll go when I'm craving filipino food. No, I'm not filipino, and no, I'm not an expert on filipino food, but I do know delicious food when I eat it and THIS place is delicious. Too delicious to stray from, even though I have to drive to BFE to enjoy it.   I knocked it down one star because theres been a few times I went when the service was bad enough that I seriously considered taking my food to go (because no, I wasn't abandoning the food after my long drive because someone wanted to be rude or have an attitude), but USUALLY the service is great- fast and polite."}
{"text":"Pancit Palabok was the very first dish I ordered from here.  It's one of my favorite Filipino dishes that I only got to eat when at family parties. Now I can have it anytime here!!! Thelma's version is awesome...rice noodles drenched in the gravy shrimp and pork sauce topped with hard boiled eggs, crumbled chicharon, green onions, sliced lemons, yeah the works! The entree is meant to feed 2+ people, but I ordered just for myself.  Other favorite staples of mine are their Pork Gisantes. The meat is tender from being stewed with bell peppers and tomato based broth. Veggie lumpia another favorite.  Eggrolls are one of the foods the general public is introduced to when trying Filipino cuisine.   I come here for Diniguan too!  The pork is tender and very tasty. I can taste the garlic which I think brings out this dish. Some people are bit put off when you tell them the English translation \"Pork Blood Stew\" and the meat is cooked in the blood juices with garlic and vinegar. It's similar to the blood sausage or British Black pudding. So other than the process or the name of the dish, dont let that stop you from trying it out. Thelma's cooking is about close as to your mom's home style Filipino cooking as you can get.    Must try: Halo Halo Special....Shaved ice topped with mixed fruits, Macapuno (Coconut) & Ube(Purple sweet yam) ice creams...order same time you get your lunch, it takes a while to crank out the shave ice.  Ambiance: Very clean, tables bussed right away. The place is Bright, natural sunlight beams down through all the windows surrounding the restaurant during the day. Maybe that's why it can feel warm even though they have the air conditioner on. For the Tagalog language challenged (ie Me) they have pictures of their different plates and entrees with the description and the menu in English.  Service: Super friendly! Lorene who is usually up in front taking orders is very helpful and knows my husband's order more than I do!  I did an order to go once and ordered fried rice. I totally forgot to mention to leave out certain ingredients from it, but Lorene knew anyways! Thank goodness! So yes the staff here are definitely  rockstars when it comes to service with a smile!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times already and it is on the opposite side of town. We go there when we are in that area since I have not found a Filipino restaurant near where we live that I like. For me, this has the basics of the Filipino food that I like: pansit & adobo and it is good & cheap. The portions for a mixed plate are kind of small, but enough. I like the shoyu chicken more than the adobo. The only negative is I am a big fan of monggo. I like mine \"soupy\" with spinach and shrimp. Theirs is thick and creamy almost with fatty pork-not a fan of that version. Everything else I have tried there has been pretty good and not overly greasy like other Filipino restaurants."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and quiet with plenty of seating. My husband ordered the 4 choice mix plate with chicken adobo, squid guisado, pancit, dinuguan and steamed rice. I had the beef sinigang and the banana lumpia special. Came out to a little over $30 including 2 sodas, delicious and worth ever penny. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Growing up with Filipino friends I have been surrounded with their food and I love it! :) So I was excited  when Thelmas opened close to home. The mix plate w. Chicken adobo, dunuguan (spl?) and a side or sinigang was delish!   The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5...the sinigang is very, very salty and not as flavorful as others I've tasted."}
{"text":"So I've lived by this place since it opened. I never went. When my mom arrived here in November, my brother took her here for lunch and brought back leftovers. She brought back adobo and oxtail soup. I ate the leftovers and thought it was pretty good.   Then, a few Sundays later, I met up with them there and we ate lumpia shanghai, the Thelma's special, adobo, pancit mix, oxtail soup and shoyu chicken. For desert we had banana lumpia and ice cream in a bowl.   Then a week later, I told Chris about it and he said, \"Dang I'm jealous, I wanted to go too!\" So we did. We shared and adobo fried rice and lechon kawali.   Then when my dad came, we came here again and pretty much had the same things, except my dad had some kind of fish soup (I forget the name of this fish) and the food was just as delicious. So...this review will be on the items I have eaten thus far.   Experience - 4.5 (out of 5) Taste of the food - 5 (no complaints)  Beverages - 5 (soda fountain, all you can drink plus they still give you a glass of water too and refill upon request).  Location - 5  Price for the food - 4  Staff- 4 Clean bathroom - 5 Safe parking lot - 5  Have a TV and the football game was on so Chris was happy - 5 Overall rating: 4.722  The portions for the price are decent. Even though my plate was a \"2 choice\" (pork adobo and pancit mix with one scoop of rice and one scoop of mac salad), the way they serve their meals, and you can easily share with whoever is dining with you. My brother had the shoyu chicken and Thelma's special and my mom had the oxtail soup. The food was plentiful and with tip came to about $50 (with 3 beverages). Seems kinda pricey for a Filipino joint, but this isn't some pick from a steam table place. It's a sit down and wait for some good grub kinda place.  I like supporting Filipinos. I like supporting Filipinos that I think are from Hawaii. (Almost everyone that was there had some kind of \"I'm from Hawaii\" type shirt or had their \"Island Pride\" sticker on the back of their vehicles.)  I like supporting businesses that treat their patrons with respect and are appreciative that we're spending our money in their establishment.   My only suggestion: the banana lumpia ice cream mix thing is yummy...just wish they put in 2 lumpias not one. I had to share this with my brother and was about to deck him for the whole thing (j/k). It was one scoop of ube ice cream with the banana lumpia sliced up and mixed together. Thanks Thelma's for giving me the idea to do that at home!!   Too bad I only itch for Filipino grub once in a while (yep, gotta watch the HBP and cholesterol since I'm not a young un' anymore!). But if I do, I'm coming back to Thelma's.   P.S. They have musubi there. Like 4 or 5 different kinds. Next time I'm going to try their longanisa musubi.   Bonus: It's about 6 minutes away from my house!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't that great, and i loooovvveee filipino food. Service was great. They were fast... They have a lot of pork dishes, which I'm not a big fan of. Would I eat there again? Probably not or maybe - if someone else is paying. Lol"}
{"text":"I don't do reviews but this one deserves it. This is for all of my Oahu people. If you love Thelma's back home, then the food is exactly the same thing here! I'm extremely happy I came to visit! I will be back for more for sure!"}
{"text":"This is so strange. I lived right next to Thelma's in Waipahu and now here I live in Henderson and guess what I live right next to Thelma's. Dude whats going on? Same bomb Thelma's Special, Adobo fried rice, Gisantes, all the favorites, the only thing missing is the little buffet that the OG restaurant puts out. The exchancge is a neat, huge dinning area with flat screen on the Filipino channel. Now i'm not filipino but my wife is so I can appreciate this kind of stuff. I always include a star for places that have orange fanta on their soda taps. Free refils of course. The food for those of you who don't know is the closest thing you'll find to a filipino home cooked meal ever in vegas. Excellent execution of traditonal filipino dishes. I may just be saying this cause I grew up on these exact take out plates and to be reunited again with my childhood comfort food is just a little too much. Tear. Clean and wide open dinning area, warm friendly staff gives this place six stars no seven...."}
{"text":"Thelmas is a very good Filipino restaurant. I ordered the 3 item mix plate with chicken adobo, pancit noodles, and pork adobo. Everything tasted flavorful with lots of soft tender pieces of meat. The service was very good!"}
{"text":"Thelma's special is the business!  Very good food, my go-to Filipino/Hawaiian eatery! Yum! :)"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious! Very friendly staff and even though we got there close to closing time, we still got hot fresh food and prompt service. We are coming back tomorrow for breakfast."}
{"text":"*top notch service and great filipino food*  GREAT SELECTION. visiting from San Diego and saw this place.   Food was cooked very well..."}
{"text":"Sorry, I wanted to like this place, because it's close to home, and my Filipino wife and I like this kind of food, but it's just not very good. Not bad, but not good either, everything was quite bland and blah.  With so much choice here in Vegas when it comes to Filipino food, I see no reason to choose this place."}
{"text":"Filipino food how are you not better known and worshiped? Oh that's right, 99% of the time these are just simple dishes, made with love and care at home. I was first introduced to Filipino fare in San Francisco. Then it was good but very greasy, Thelma was nothing like the dishes I remembered. It's funny because the flavor and textures remind me if very trendy and at times very expensive cuisine. Take for example their lechon. If you are a fan or pork belly, this dish is heaven. Seriously, so good you know it's bad for you. Another example is their chicken adobo. So tender it's braised until it's falling off the bone. The squid guisado, is braised until tender and has some serious deep sea flavor. If you are a fan of the whole snout to tail movement, once again they have you covered. We have tripe, ox tail, hoof, the offal options are varied and done right. The staff is so kind and patient. They happily make recommendations and explain anything that may spark your interest. Prices are ridiculously good, and portions, well let's just say good luck. If you have never had the privilege of experiencing this cuisine Thelma's is the best place to introduce you to it."}
{"text":"Found this by accident thru Yelp! Was looking for Filipino food in Henderson and by chance found Thelma's. Location isn't the best, it's had to see from the street.  I've tried the Pork giusantes, pancit (good), Thelma's Special (thumbs down), chicken adobo fried rice (delicious!), adobo chicken and pork (both awesome!) I usually get the 2 item mix plate with 2 scoops of rice.    I do not like the Thelma's Special, it's fatty pork with crispy pork skin and sauce. Not a big fan of the fatty pork, but the sauce is awesome. If the pork were leaner, I would love the dish. The adobo pork and chicken are both great, very tender and tasty!    I have not eaten in the restaurant yet, but the take out service is great, fast, and friendly!"}
{"text":"I had to try this place since I am Filipino and am always looking for great place to remind me of mom's and family home cooking!!  Lunch Orders:  3 item combination: Gisantes(Filipino Marinated Pork and Peas), Thelma's Special (Pan Fried Pork with onions, tomatoes and soy/vinegar sauce) and Pork Adobo with white rice. Gisantes was Addicting, Thelmas Special was Especially Delicious and Pork Adobo Much Better than most Adobo I've had!!  Lechon Kawali: Pan roasted pork dish with a brown dipping sauce. Came Neatly sliced, Crispy Skin, Succulent tasting meat and Not too oily! Dipping sauce was the Best I've had and was a Must with every bite!!  Sinigang Soup and Veggies Only: Filipino Sour Soup/Stew was a nice to sip on between bites of meat and rice. However, I've never tried a Sinigang with a mild sourness and I believe under seasoned soup.. Although, it wasn't my type (I've had Many versions of Sinigang, I like more sourness)  it was still heart warming and the chunks of tomaotes and green beans felt healthy compared to everything else I was having!  Damn Close and Comparable to My Mother's and Family members Cooking!!! Reasonable Value, Corteous and Polite Staff and Clean dining space makes me a Fan For Sure!!!"}
{"text":"I came into Thelma's for a quick bit and got the Kare-Kare to-go.  The Kare-Kare was pretty decent as is the other food that I have had here.  The lechon and bangus plates I have had during my other visits are definitely good as far as Filipino food goes - but it just doesn't blow me away as the hype seems to suggest.   It is not a \"turo-turo\" style Filipino spot where you typically have the food ready made but its not a traditional restaurant spot where you get seated and a server comes to take your order.  Its like a combo spot - you have to get in line to order and then they take it to your table to eat.  I would liken it to a Smash Burger ordering and eating experience - or \"fast casual\" as they call it in F&B.   All in all, decent and I would come again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Came here after a workout and was so glad I did! The place is very spacious and wasn't busy when we came in so food came out very quickly. The lady working there was also so nice and sweet, it is self/service but she was very attentive making sure we had every thing we needed.   The lumpia is so good! Fried fresh to order so it came out crispy and burn your tongue hot! I do noticed that their lumpia is more expensive than other places like Fiesta Filipina (6 pieces for $6) but the lumpia do have more stuffing and is thicker than other places. The garlic rice did not have as much flavor as I expected but was still good. The crispy pork belly with onions and tomato was so good!   Would definitely be coming back if I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Went for our first time on a Thurs evening. Food was ok,staff seemed to be busy dealing with the kitchen area. We were one of three tables of people. I don't know if they normally keep it so dark. We had pancit with lumpia. Just noodles and a few tiny bits of cabbage,lumpia wasn't very good,almost burnt and was mostly wrapper. We also had the pork and pumpkin. Very little of the pork was edible.  Mostly fat and hard dry pieces that I couldn't chew. The sauce was very tasty."}
{"text":"If you're craving good Filipino food, Thelma's has the best pancit, blood meat and Thelma's special. It was so delicious and tasted like home cooking! I wish I had room for dessert."}
{"text":"The best Filipino restaurant in town. Friendly service, reasonable prices, generous portions, and excellent food. My favorite dishes are the pork gisantes, pinakbet, pancit, Thelma's special and the adobo fried rice. Their macaroni salad is surprisingly good too. It is a very spacious restaurant with a relaxing ambiance."}
{"text":"I live on the north side of town and drive 25 min to come eat at Thelmas....BEST Adobo in town 5 Stars"}
{"text":"Lots of tasty looking menu items had me indecisive. My husband and I finally decided on two things: The Sisig and the Adobo Loco Moco  The sisig was delicious. Crisp pieces of pork seasoned well and full of flavor. The portion was a normal size, but the overall taste of it had us wanting more.   The adobo loco moco was okay ($8.25). Since I'm an adobo fan and also a loco moco fan, the combination of both sounded heavenly. I went further and paid the extra amount to add adobo fried rice as a substitution for the white rice. Do not do this -- my rice was drenched in adobo sauce. No white at all. Because of this, I wasn't able to tame down the saltiness of the adobo taste. I couldn't even taste my egg. Next time, I'll definitely keep the white rice option for balance. Still was good, but would definitely be better if ordered as is (adobo loco moco with white rice)...that's unless you love soupy adobo flavored rice  Additional pros: Lots of seating. Friendly customer service. Many menu options. Check-in for 10% off your meal"}
{"text":"The place is clean and spacious. Staff is corteous and fast service. And the food are delicious...they are close to my place so they have always been my saviour whenever the wife is craving something that taste like home. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to try something new, so we read some reviews of restaurants in the area and headed off to Thelma's.  We had no idea what to order, once there.  The woman behind the counter was extremely helpful and patient.  She helped us order, what turned out to be, a wonderful meal.  The food was great, the dining area was very clean and the staff was helpful.  We will be visiting Thelma's again."}
{"text":"Great home cook food. I cannot ask better. Service was very fast and friendly. The restaurant is very clean. And definitely will return when we are back in Vegas"}
{"text":"gross,soooo oversalted, fatty,unhealthy and overpriced."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this since I moved here because of the 4 and 5 star reviews here on Yelp. While the service here is very good, I would have to say that the food is just OK. ( based on what I ordered - Thelma's Special)."}
{"text":"I went to this place here in Vegas,I was so disappointed with there portion, their adobo omelette portion is like a mini.come on thelma's don't be stingy.my thelma's special is burnt."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant find. There aren't many non 'turo-turo' Filipino restaurants here in Vegas.   I'm sad that this place is so far from my house - because I would love to eat here more often. The service was great. Everyone was friendly, and attentive to our needs. The place is pretty new as well - so everything is nice and clean.   Food was pretty good - but they didn't have as big of a selection as I would hope they had. I ended up having the mix plate - consisting of Thelma's Special and Chicken Adobo. I loved Thelma's Special, but it came with a bit too many onions for me - it heavily outweigh the amount of tomatoes I received. Other than that, it was good. Sauce was good and so was the lechon kawali. The chicken in the adobo was very tender - but overall the dish was a bit too salty for my liking.   Someone else ended up ordering the Tocino... I didn't try it - but it definitely wasn't the type of Tocino I'm used to eating. But, it still looked good.   Overall - if I were in the area, I would go back to eat there. Prices were decent, and I'm always down to eat more Filipino food. But, it's not something that I would drive to that side of town for."}
{"text":"Awesome Authentic Filipino food! Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Love the sinigang, bangus and pinakbet. We also got a large order of Lumpia for our family party. Feels like eating at our grandma's kitchen!"}
{"text":"I'm so sorry but I just can't seem to understand their food.  Friend rice with egg and bacon. It was just straight up STILL white rice doused in soy sauce. For almost $6 for a small portion (VERY SMALL) not really worth the money nor actual food.  Service was okay. I ordered over the phone for pick up. I would come back to use my 10% off, and I hope they'd still take it."}
{"text":"Blink and you miss this place but once you find it you won't be disappointed.  It is located in a strip center in the back. Once the navigational says \"destination\" turn into the parking lot and drive around the lot.  It has  a large dining area but we were the only ones there at 1:00pm a few to go orders came in and out as we dined in. You walk up to a counter and order and your food is delivered to your table of choice.  We both ordered the  lunch special two items with rice. I wanted to order something I've never ordered before so I had the adobo fried rice, Panapaitan (a sour soupy stew) and Thelma's lechon kewali crispy pork  with onions and tomatoes. It was all very delicious except for the rice.  Cheap too, under $10.00 for lunch plate and a drink.  Service was excellent the girl who took our order also delivered our food was very friendly.  She told us this was an off shoot of Thelma's in Hawaii.  A little aloha in Las Vegas.  Check it out"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Thursday night. We ordered a couple of combo dishes of shoyu chicken, chicken adobo, stewed beef and pancit mix. Although we weren't fans of their particular mix of pancit, the shoyu chicken and chicken adobo were delicious!  A tasty good deal!"}
{"text":"When my boyfriend and I arrived to this cute little bistro, there were only 1 or 2 tables occupied. The walls of the interior are painted a light green color that I enjoyed. There are gold statuettes along the walls, as well as many large windows that fill the space with natural light. On most, if not all, of the tables are little vases with orchids. It was a pleasant dining area even with the TV playing in the background. It can be hard to spot if you don't pull into the parking area behind Aloha kitchen.   The menu is displayed on the wall along with several photos of their specialties. J quickly decided on the lechon kawali, a large portion of crispy skinned pork with juicy, fatty meat on the inside. It came with a vinegary dipping sauce that complimented the richness of the meat and several slices of raw sweet onion. It was REALLY crisp, crackled when you bite into kind of crisp. I found it made my jaw muscles tired after eating 3-4 pieces- but probably not a bad thing since all that chewing might help work off some of that delicious pork fat. I ordered the adobo, which was a large bowl full of super tender, soy and vinegar-spiced pork chunks. The cuts of pork reminded me of some of the better carnitas I've had, with enough gristle and unrendered fat left to give it an unctuous mouth feel. The flavorful sauce was great to pour over the perfectly cooked sticky rice and more of it would've disappeared easily. It seemed like a dish that had been cooking low and slow for quite some time, a signature of many comforting dishes. I would have liked some vegetables with it to break up all the meatiness, but it was a delicious dish. The texture of the rice was great with the pork. We also got an order of the Shanghai lumpia, which would have all vanished if I hadn't caught J before he got to them all! Crisp, narrow cigar-shaped little pockets of deep-fried meaty goodness served with a sweet and sour chili sauce, it's easy to see why.   We also had an Ilikoi passion drink and Kona coffee. The coffee was lovely but was served with packets of non-dairy creamer, which saddens me a little. It's really a small detail, but when having such a nice variety of coffee I want to enjoy it fully and without high fructose/hydrogenated processed things. Not a huge deal because it still tasted great, but something I find worth pointing out. I was really excited that they offered kona coffee! The passion fruit drink was also tasty, though J drank most of it. The water tasted like tap water, so we barely sipped any.  Overall, the food here was great. If you're a fan of the Hawaiian Sun drinks I imagine you'll be happy. It's a nice change of pace from the usual strip mall fare and I'd rather go here than to another McChipotle or Pei Wei. Not my usual neighborhood hang out, but I can see going back sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Filipino places in Las Vegas.   Haven't had anything I didn't like and the service is great and efficient.  My favorites are Thelma's special fried rice, adobo fried rice,  fried pork and their lechon kawali.  A must stop for any Filipino Foodie.  Will keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a cheap meal and stumbled across Thelma's. Took a quick look at their menu and knew I had to try their pork adobo (SIDE NOTE: if a Filipino restaurant can't make a delicious adobo dish, there's a problem). Also decided to try their Thelma's Special... which stole the show.   2 item combo ended up costing roughly $8 dollars and came with 2 scoops of rice (or 1 scoop rice, 1 scoop mac salad). Great bargain. As mentioned in other reviews, dining area is clean, service friendly BUT... the air-conditioning was lacking. A bit warm but nothing to be crazy concerned about. Look forward to coming back and trying their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Ate here a few months ago and ordered ALOT of food and everything was disappointing. Nothing tasted homemade or authentic. Tastes like Americanized Filipino food. My moms tastes way better. The lumpia was even disgusting and the chicken adobo wasn't appetizing at all. Idk how this place has so many good reviews because if you are a true Filipino, you know dang well that this place doesn't taste good at all."}
{"text":"Coming from Hawaii where the other Thelma's is at, I am very familiar with their Filipino spread. The difference is this location doesn't have a buffet but it is much nicer and cleaner looking. If there's only 2 of you and you're both pretty hungry, I would say you best bet is the 4 choice mix plate for around $10 (my fav combo-pancit mix, guisantes, squid guisado, mongo beans) which comes with 2 scoops of rice. Their bangus sinigang ($13) is pretty good. The one thing I didn't like was their oxtail soup. It only had oxtail (small ones), onions, and some other vegetable which in my opinion is not worth the price. Parking is plentiful as its located near Sunset Station and Casino. Funny story alert...I called for a takeout order once and asked if they had Bicol Express as my wife was craving it. When I asked if they had it, the female employee replied, \"Umm..what's that?\" My wife and I laughed hysterically..."}
{"text":"I'm from Seattle and grew up in Hawaii. My biggest complaint about Seattle Filipino food is that it is more miss than hit. I'm told this restaurant has ties to Elena's in Hawaii. The food here is legit. Reminds me of home.   I had the Mixed Plate (4 choices): Pork Gisantes, Squid Guisado, Pinakbet, and Thelma's Special (chopped lechon kawali with tomatoes, onions, and soy sauce). For desert, Banana Lumpia.   And it was all good.  I love the food here."}
{"text":"the BEST filipino food in the valley.  this is actually the same Thelma's restaurant that's in Hawaii.... I'm lucky enough to live pretty close to it, but if you are coming from north las vegas or summerlin i'm telling you, it is worth the trip!   everything is made fresh instead of just \"buffet\" style like the other filipino restaurants.  Thelma's special, kare kare, and adobo fried rice here are my personal favorites."}
{"text":"We were in the area the other day for a glass blowing class. My wife is Filipina and when we saw Thelma's we decided to give it a try.  While I have to admit that Filipino food is not my favorite, Thelma's did a nice job with it. I ordered the chicken adobo fried rice which was served with a fried egg on top. It was really good.  My wife ordered a combo plate with dinuguan and pinakbet. My wife liked hers as well. If we're on that side of town, I'd go to Thelma's again."}
{"text":"I come here when I need  mix of Filipino and select Hawaiian dishes when I miss Hawaii. This hits the spot every time. Their staple plate, The Thelma's Special, is always a good choice."}
{"text":"So I finally made it to Thelma's this weekend with my hubby. Glad I called for directions as it was in a hidden location on Marks/Sunset. I couldn't believe they had been opened since March 2010 as I never knew they were around (and I'm pretty good at knowing where the Filipino joints are...as there's not too many of them in Las Vegas, let alone Henderson)   As we got outta the parking lot, we were greeted by the Cashier as she happened to be outside. As we walked in we were happy to finally see a big dining room as most Filipino restaurants are much smaller. It was clean and quiet...but may have been due to the fact that there was only two tables occupied by two families. The staff offered to help my hubby (I'm guessing since he's Caucasian) choose a dish; however little do they know that he knows Filipino food and can even cook it. But it was a nice gesture to say the least. Now onto our meal:   Thelma's special: this was deep fried lechon kawali chopped up in small cubes served with tomatoes and onions on top. My issue with this is that it's served with a very bland sweet brown sauce. When we poured vinegar on it, it tasted much better and gave it that kick it needed. I only wish that we had some chopped jalapenos to add heat to it.   Beef Steak and onions: This dish is one of my hubby's faves; however he absolutely hated this dish as it had a sweet sauce base. The ones we've had in the past is usually cooked in garlic, soy sauce, and vinegar (similar to adobo) but this had a Hawaiian flare to it. We later found out that Thelma's is more of a Hawaiian/Filipino restaurant which originated in Hawaii.   Pork Adobo Fried Rice with scrambled egg on top: Now this was the best I've ever had! There were shredded pork mixed in and the rice was fried just right. I could have eaten this alone. My hubby and I wiped this plate clean.   Although my hubby will most likely not come back to this place, if I'm in the area, I will definitely go back for more Pork Adobo Fried rice."}
{"text":"only did a quick glance at the menu when i came in and ordered the Thelma's special, lechon kawali, pieces of crispy pork skin and fatty tender pork meat with tomato, onion and soy sauce. definitely filled me after doing the brew tour at Joseph James Brewing Company.  There aren't a lot of Filipino restaurants in the area so I like what Thelma's is offering, excellent selection of Filipino food, clean and lots of space. If you haven't had a lot of Filipino food you can either buy one of everything or just get the choice of four mixed plate so you can try at least 4 dishes. i haven't tried the ones here yet but try sinigang soup, pinakbet, lechon, beef or chicken adobo, lumpia, and the since it hot right now halo halo. all the pictures from the other yelpers also help.  saw some delicious looking pictures of omelet and fried rice dishes so i'll be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the Sinigang boneless bangus and lechon kawali. While waiting for order to be served they asked if we can just have the \"chopped\" lechon kawali... this is the chopped version topped with tomatoes and onion. Alternative was offered because they said the bigger chops of lechon kawali will take a while to cook. (Well we should have been told before we paid.)  The Sinigang na bangus was good. But the \"chopped\" lechon kawali isn't. They weren't crunchy as expected and tasted old, like pork left overs just reheated.  The place seems clean, even the restrooms are surprisingly acceptable compared to other small Filipino joints we've gone to. The staff are courteous.   We might come back if we are in the area. We'll just make sure not to settle for alternatives."}
{"text":"Born and raised in the Bay Area, I have been exposed to the Filipino culture from my days as a small child. The families I have been around have always been so welcoming, and the food has always been phenomenal. Needless to say, I was expecting this same type of experience at Thelma's.   My family and I ate lunch there a few days ago, and were a little shocked at the lack of customer service we received.  I get it; this place is not your typical set up. You need to order your food at the counter and then seat yourself.  Someone will then drop your food off at your table and will never check on you again. However, I noticed that other customers inside the restaurant were receiving more attention than we were. I only know some cuss words in Tagalog, so I couldn't follow the conversations. Don't get me wrong, they staff didn't mistreat us, nor were they rude in any way. We were basically ignored. For example, after our meal I went up to order the Coco-nana dessert. When the lady brought us our dessert, she didn't even grab our dirty dishes off of the table as she was heading back to the kitchen. I pre-tipped her when I paid for my bill, and felt that was the least she could have done. It's not like they were garbage cans around so I could clear my own table. I was less than satisfied from a customer service standpoint, but the food was good.  For an appetizer, we decided on the Shanghai lumpia. These were close to perfect, and were accompanied by a sweet chili dipping sauce. My only complaint was that there were only 6 in the order. I could eat 2 dozen of these by myself-they are so addicting. For our entree, we decided on the chicken adobo. Good--but I have had better. Specifically, the adobo lacked seasoning and came across as a little bland. The pancit was delicious! However, my favorite part of this meal was the previously mentioned coco-nana dessert. Warm banana bread with a scoop of coconut ice cream over the top was the perfect end to our meal.  I didn't even care that I am lactose intolerant.   I really like this place and am thankful that there is authentic Filipino food in Henderson. However, I am disappointed that the Filipino culture  I was familiar with did not coincide with the customer service inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm a Retired Army due to injuries I sustain in Iraq & I work for Washington Traffic Patrol. On March 25, 2017 around lunch time I was passing thru to see My Love (Future Wife) when I decided to get something to eat. I been to so many Fhilipino Restaurant and I was not satisfied with any. So I went online to look for a Fhilipino Restaurant when I came across THELMA's FHILIPINO RESTAURANT and saw it was a 4 Star. What I was surprised was that on the comments it said it was clean area, so I decided to check if it's clean. When I got to the Restaurant I was surprise everywhere was clean and from where I can see from behind the cash register it was also clean. I looked in the restroom and at the table I sat at and all where so clean. What surprise me was that one of there Special Mixed plate which consist of multiple choices they had and prices they had were so reasonable there shouldn't be anyone to complain. So yes I am so happy I found an awesome Fhilipino Restaurant in Henderson, Nevada and I'm always passing thru the area 3-5 times a month, but starting from today I'll always always stop by the Restaurant every time I'm around. So if you want to make every penny you spent worth it then by all means go to that restaurant and if not it's ok cause I'll eat some for you.....lol"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I have two boys that are picky eaters 11 and 4, so when we go out I always have to order tons of food to please everyone. I always order the pork adobo fried rice omelet, mixed pancit, pork and peas, Thelma's special, shanghai lumpia, and banana lumpia. The prices are great, portions are good size, food is delicious, service is quick and friendly, plus the restaurant is always clean. Give it a try it's one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I have been craving some good Filipino food since moving to Las Vegas. And I think I found my favorite spot!  The location is easy to find. It borders Sunset Station on Sunset Ave - right across from Galleria mall. Ample parking. Lots of seating - great for our party of 8.  And the food - hit the spot! I highly recommend the Thelma's special. Lechon kawali, so delicious!  If you're craving good Filipino food, Thelma's is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Thier food is amazing. I have been to this place twice and so far I have tasted Thelma's special, squid, pancit, ltapsilog, umpia, turon snd longanisa musubi. Everythig tasted good and fresh."}
{"text":"Having never eaten Filipino food I was anxious to try something new. We made our way into the restaurant and liked that they had menus with pictures. You walk in and go to a counter to order your food. I told the person at the counter that I had never had Filipino food and he was very helpful with his suggestions. I got the adobo chicken and pork. The wife and kids got some kind of sweet chicken. All I know is that when the food is brought to the table the smells are wonderful. I can honestly say the chicken was the best I ever had. It was super flavorful and moist. Everyone had a great meal, and my daughter has already asked if we can go back. If your near this place stop in. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My Filipina wife and I just finished the food and starting on Halo Halo Special and Coco Nana now. Wife had the Pampano Sinigang and I had the lunch special with Chicken Adobo. Both were excellent. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Ok folks let me tell you about this place. So it's not fancy or anything. It feels like a family restaurant you would find in Hawaii. Better off coming in shorts, flip flops and a T. It's one of those places where people eat everyday at. After eating there a week they will probably know your name and favorite meal. It's local. You walk in, very relaxed, mosey through the menu and then walk up to the counter. Have a chat place your order and sit and chill. No rush. It's a Fillipino restaurant and the food isn't amazing, but it's REALLY good home cooking. which I think is exactly what they are going for. Make u feel at home.   The staff are really friendly. Treat you like your cousins or something like that. The place is clean. The decor is old school Hawaiian family restaurant. It could literally be in 50 first dates.   I ordered the 2 meat special. I got pork adobo, shoyu chicken, lumpia Shanghai, rice and macaroni salad. The pork was tasty. It was a little fatty but still tasty. The lumpia was also tasty. Not my favorite sauce to dip in but again it was good. Rice was good and so was the macaroni salad. Now the Shoyu Chicken was DA BOMB!!!! Just right amount of sweet with salt and chicken that falls off the bone. I gobbled that right up. It was like being at your families BBQ with really good food. I didn't get up and slap my momma or anything......MOMMA!!!! But I did shake her hand very hard.......VERY HARD!!!!  All in all I will be back to Thelma! Good Job Cousins!!! LOL!!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Filipino restaurant! We always have to order the fried pork, adobo fried rice omelette and Thelma's special! Service is always fast and friendly with aloha spirit! And plus the Filipino channel is always on!! Super traditional and reminds us of the one in Hawaii!"}
{"text":"My cousin and his family who live in Oceanside, CA, pass through and visit Las Vegas/Henderson quite frequently, and whenever they are here, they HAVE to eat at Thelma's. That means I'm also invited to dine here frequently. There there are usually around 10 of us who meet to eat, so we order 'family style'. Everything has been delicious and once again, reminiscent of home (Hawaii). Just a few things we have ordered and liked: chicken adobo friend rice, pork adobo, chicken adobo, dinuguan (I don't eat the chocolate meat but my family loves it), pork gisantes, pancit and shoyu chicken. Items are flavorful and as least greasy as this type of cuisine can be.   The staff is friendly and patient-we order a lot and frequently. Decor reminds me of a typical Filipino restaurant back home in Hawaii (not a bad thing!)."}
{"text":"Coming from a family of great cooks (Mom and many Titas - all from Pampanga) we are always on the lookout for good Filipino food here in the states.  If you're out of town and you're looking for this place - set your GPS to find the Sunset Station Casino, then look to the small strip center directly in front of the Casino.  We got two kinds of Lechon - the \"traditional\" kawali style and \"Thelma's Special\" - the kawali was EXCELLENT - super crispy and the perfect cuts of meat, fat, and crispy skin.  Kare-Kare, Shanghai Lumpia, Boneless Bangus, and (of course) Pork BBQ all hit the table very quickly and freshly cooked.  Perhaps my favorite part is the \"openness\" of their kitchen - you can clearly see it from the dining room, as well as the back hallway leading to the restrooms, where they have a large window that lets you really see behind the scenes.  Being in the restaurant business for the last 20+ years, I've really come to an appreciation of any business (especially Family owned) that has a high standard of cleanliness and food safety.  The staff was very friendly - didn't mind speaking to our mixed group in either Tagalog or English - and responded to every request eagerly and with genuine hospitality.  Looks like our family has a new \"regular\" spot whenever we come to Vegas!!!  Maraming Salamat!"}
{"text":"After looking around the Galleria Mall, I stopped by Thelma's Filipino Restaurant to get a hearty meal.. and a hearty delicious meal is what I received. Location is right across the street from the mall itself and nearby Sunset Station casino. I missed my friend's Father cooking homemade Chicken Adobo and Pork Gisantes.. oh the aroma that filled the room as he cooked these dishes. I woke up to this every time I slept over at her place. One of many reasons why I loved spending a night there :P So sometimes I have cravings for something sour, sweet, and tangy all in one visit. This place is just what I needed.   I loved the dining area... so spacious and clean. The light green colored walls and wooden chairs gave this place such an cool, soft ambiance... I couldn't help but think I was in Hawaii or somewhere tropical. I enjoyed sitting by the window and having the sun rest on my face. Nice to look out and enjoy a beautiful day!!!  I ordered a mixed plate of the choice of two.... I chose the one scoop of rice and mac salad with two entrees of the Pork Gisantes and Chicken Adobo. When the plate arrived, it had a wonderful fragrant, color, and looked so tasty!!! It was one huge chicken piece for the Chicken Adobo and the meat was so tender that you wouldn't even need a knife to cut it. All I had to do was peel the meat off with my fork. Juicy and a burst of flavor... it had a small acidic bite, but the sauce was so delicious with rice. The Pork Gisantes had chunks of meat, green peas and green bell peppers. The meat had a few chunks of fat too, but it contributes to the flavor of the dish, so I didn't mind at all. The sauces from both dishes were wonderful to taste...  It was a combination of sweetness and sour. I asked for the condiments and added some vinegar/garlic sauce to the Pork Gisantes, because I like to go a little extreme on the sour side. Maybe too much..  where you coat your whole tongue full of vinegar!!! I love it!   After I finished everything... I always loved the Filipino dessert... Halo Halo! So I ordered their Halo Halo Special that came with Macapuno Ube(Young Coconut Purple Yam) ice cream! YUM. They serve it to you in a glass bowl with two scoops of ice cream and a piece of leche flan on top of crushed ice. Underneath the ice is where all the goodies are placed. Sugar palm fruit, jackfruit, nata de coco (chewy, jelly-like), and sweet beans are all mixed together to enjoy. It's topped off with some toasted crushed young rice and it's a wonderful treat to have after a tangy, hearty meal. And also you can sip it like a drink when you ate everything and all the ice has melted. So delicious and revitalizing to the senses!!!   Service was very friendly and helpful. Although I don't eat much Filipino cuisine, I do love it every time I come here. Brings back good old memories and flavors I missed during my childhood. Their chicken adobo was very close in how my friend's father used to make it. Tantalizing aromas and flavorful dishes awaits for you at Thelma's Filipino Restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried the mix plate with Gisantes (my favorite dish), some chicken adobo (very tender), some pancit mix, and pork fried rice (extra $2 charge but totally worth it!) I can see why everyone raves about this place, and even Manny Pacquiao comes here to eat?!?! Of course I will be back. What a great find!  TIP: Don't forget to show your check in on Yelp when you pay at the register and get 10% off!!"}
{"text":"Really wanted like this place more.  Nice clean place.  Friendly service.  The food, this is where it fell short..  I ordered the palobok and I've never had it like this.   Kinda strange yellow sauce that was just poured on top.   It was alright but not what I was wanting used to.  I also ordered a chicken musubi and the chicken was a bit too chewy.   I will have to give this place another try but first impressions was not good."}
{"text":"CONDENSED IN A SOUP CAN:  Good Introduction Food for non-Filipinos - cooked well and not heavily seasoned.  THE MEAT: We had a lot of it because that's what hubby craved for.  We had pork adobo fried rice with fried eggs (adobo = anything stewed in garlic, soy sauce and vinegar), a sweetish salty pork sausage (longganisa), deep fried pork belly and the halo-halo special (a crushed ice dessert with beans and purple yam ice cream).  Everything was cooked (prepared) perfectly.  Hubby and I didn't know if it was our allergies acting up, but we found the food a little lacking in taste.  We wanted a little more soy, vinegar and garlic in everything... even more sugar in the halo-halo.  The only sweetness was coming from the ice cream (which you do not get in the regular order).    I'd give this place 3.5 stars for the food, but because the place is large, clean and has awesome service, it merits 4 stars here.  If you were a health buff or a Filipino Food Virgin, definitely go to this joint.  If you're a little more adventurous with a well seasoned palette, you can try DT's Filipino Food.  Don't be fazed by the Chinese décor and the poor ratings on Yelp.  They have a good chef from Pampangga.  I'M STILL DIGESTING... All the grease from my meal.  Hehe.  Filipino food is soaked in fat/oil and is meant to be eaten in hot weather.  So when it is served, eat is fast.  Then exercise a little.  ;)  WANT TO SEE SOME FOOD PORN? :-)  Adobo Rice http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thelmas-filipino-restaurant-henderson?select=xYE3EQn05Hk17CtFgp6OOw#o_b8zRARbqPoDKlC7mXGTw Longganisa http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thelmas-filipino-restaurant-henderson?select=xYE3EQn05Hk17CtFgp6OOw#NqQc4KgVWN7lYxeii69EpA Lechon Kawali http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thelmas-filipino-restaurant-henderson?select=xYE3EQn05Hk17CtFgp6OOw#sKPQeo2eIWVvAf39_hchSQ Halo-Halo http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thelmas-filipino-restaurant-henderson?select=xYE3EQn05Hk17CtFgp6OOw#lZ7ciIT90t2rnmp_dEytsw"}
{"text":"Practically my second home. Great, authentic menu/food. Never had a bad meal here and great folks that work/own. Whenever i'm looking for comfort food this is the place."}
{"text":"Just like home without the buffet. Great service. Home away from home!"}
{"text":"Food:  Thelma's Special, Pancit Palabok, Lumpia Shanghai, \"Coco nana\".  Thema's Filipino Restaurant has been a longstanding little restaurant which I've had the pleasure to eat at quite a few times when it first opened up.  Since moving away from that side of town, it has been awhile, but it so happened that we were in the area this week.  To put simply, it no longer remains up to par from what it used to be.  Upon taking our seats, three different high chairs had to be brought in as the first two had broken seat belts for our baby.  Our food came fairly quickly but not hot at all.  Thelma's special consists of fried pork belly, mixed with fresh diced tomatoes and onions.  The lechon (pork belly) just wasn't up to par as other more recently opened Filipino restaurants in Nevada, and the portions of meat were considerably smaller than before.    Their version of pancit palabok just wasn't special, either.  The taste was very bland and dish came hardly warm.  We didn't even finish the plate and our leftovers sat in the fridge until thrown away.  That usually doesn't happen with Filipino food.  To end the night with dessert, I ordered their \"coco-nana\".  Coconut ice cream on banana nut bread.    Only when the dessert came out, they had purple Taro ice cream instead.  Our server stated they ran out of coconut ice cream.  If that were the case, why not ask the customer first if a substitution was okay or not?  Between our water cups never being refilled and this, a sadly disappointing experience both food and service-wise.    Yelp 100 Challenge 2016 - 20/100"}
{"text":"So this is probably the best Filipino restaurant I've been to in Vegas although technically its in Henderson. The lechon kawali which I always order was excellent, not too much fat like there is a other restaurants and the skin was nice and crisp, the pork and pumpkin dish that my wife ordered was also very good, the vegi was firm not soggy and that banana bread with ice cream is to die for. Oh and thank you yelp for getting us 10% off!"}
{"text":"Tagalog's can now feel the wraith of Ilocanos good Filipino food haha. Thelma special is always the recommended, it's better served as a la carte because the combo serving isn't great. Mongo beans and gisantes is awesome. My wife loves the bindongo and idago."}
{"text":"Food was great, next time I'm in Vegas I'll be stopping by again.   Recommend the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette."}
{"text":"The Best Authentic Filipino Food from Hawaii!"}
{"text":"First off, I had to drive all the way around the building to find it. They are located in the back. If they didnt have a sign in the front of the building, you would never know they were there!   Make sure you check in to get 10 percent off your order.   Just about everything on the menu is dee-lish. I usually get the lechon and pork adobo with steamed rice. I love the fact that they give you a small cup of diced tomatos and onions mixed with soy sauce and vinegar. You gotta have that along with the Mang Tomas sauce for the lechon. It's not lechon without it! Now I don't need to describe it to you if you're a first timer. I would say its a safe bet for your first time. Once you get a taste of these two items, you will come back for more. Of course you gotta eat it with the steamed rice to equalize the flavor. Otherwise, you will complain that it is too salty.  To top it off, you gotta get the Halo-Halo for dessert! Its so good that they named it twice! Good to share but if you are able to finish it by yourself than you better get checked for worms! LOL.   Service is ok. When you have a grip of people in there, don't expect to get your food with a snap of your fingers. They take cash and cards."}
{"text":"Visited last week and was very happy. It took a few minutes longer than expected but it was well worth the wait. WILL return, next time in town."}
{"text":"Lechon with onions and the milk fish is delicious! I came here Sunday and got a decent portion (not enough meat, in my opinion). I did enjoy the Filipino food, which I rarely eat."}
{"text":"This has become one of our favorite Filipino restaurants in Las Vegas, even though it is in Henderson. Thelma Special is the deep fried pork with tomatoes and onions, absolutely delicious. Also had the pork adobe and pancit, all very good. The owners are from Hawaii so there are some Hawaiian foods to like Loco Moco, Spam musibi and Kawali musubi.  The place is a bit hard to find, it's in a small strip mall in the parking lot of the Sunset Station Casino."}
{"text":"This was one of the first Filipino places I got to enjoy in Vegas, even though it's so far away from me. You order at the counter then wait for them to deliver your food. Thelma's special is their lechon kawali with tomatoes and onions, which has a ton of flavor, but you can always just order the lechon kawali plain if you prefer using an alternative sauce (Mang Tomas, Soy Sauce/Lemon). Other items I have really enjoyed here are the longanisa fried rice, which comes in mini or regular versions, and the kare kare. I would call ahead to confirm their hours because I have definitely made the trip here only for them to be closed. Their version of halo halo is bean-less, so I probably wouldn't order that from here again, but with all their other tasty options, it doesn't matter to me too much. One of the things that makes me happy about this place is that it is frequented by both Filipinos and non-Filipinos alike - glad to see Filipino food is making a name for itself!"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are the bomb.com here! The chicken adobo is my favorite thing on the the menu. If you want some quick delicious lunch spots check this place out!"}
{"text":"I really don't like Filipino food, and this started when me and my older brother went to visit our grandparents on Lanai for the entire summer, and because of that we took our pet dog with us.   The island of Lanai has a very large Filipino population, and my brother made me dislike Filipino food at a very young age by telling me that a Filipino family got my dog, and ate him when he went missing.  Since then, I avoid it like the plague, and even thought I'm proud to be part Filipino, I still won't touch the stuff at all;  BUT....one day, I had to take my Mom and a few of her friends to eat here, and had no choice in the matter but hangout with  them.  I reluctantly looked at the menu, and gave into the Fried Rice special.    Guess what, I actually liked it.   I have to admit, the meats (Portuguese sausage, spam, smoke meats)  were pretty big cuts, and was abundant throughout the rice mixture.   The only fallback, they should have added more Oyster sauce, but I just asked them for a small cup on the side, and it turned out great.  This place is kind of hard to find, but it's located behind Vitamin Shoppe.   I heard one great thing about this restaurant...anytime Manny Pacquiao is in Las Vegas, he will visit this place at least once for breakfast.    Looks like I'm going to have a few fried rice in the next few months.  As for my dog, he came back home after a few weeks, and a few months later we heard that Lanai had a rather large population of part Dachshund puppies around the city being given away."}
{"text":"Must say, it was my first time trying ube ice cream and it was delicious.  The dishes were good. The fried rice and pork belly were just a little salty for me, but nevertheless delicious.  The food came out one by one over a 25-30 minute time period, so it was a bit awkward for groups not sharing the food.  + I wish they had more vegetables in their menu.  Overall a fine experience. Good food, great value. Friendly staff, clean place, and spacey."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, was greeted with a smile . Food was very good. This place is very clean including the kitchen area and bathroom. I will definitely come back on our next visit to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Thelma's used to be my favorite Filipino restaurant but lately the quality of their food hasn't been up to par. I ordered take out chicken adobo, only to get home and find out they gave me fatty inedible pieces of pork. Sad thing is, I actually tipped and complimented them on how speedy their service was. LMAO. I need to find a new Filipino spot."}
{"text":"I love coming here. There always nice and fast service. The food here just like back home ono grinds."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and couldn't be happier (or fuller). Pork adobo, Thelma's special (lechon pork with tomatoes, onions, and a soy sauce-based sauce), and pork gisante with rice, macaroni salad. and garlic rice. Also enjoyed Portuguese sausage musubi and lumpia. Drink included with lunch. Great prices, great food, table service, no frills, and no frills needed. Yum! Get your intro to Filipino food here, and you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"The best Filipino food in Vegas! Only downside is it's far from where I live. If it was closer I would go more often to get that Thelma's special! You can't go without ordering at least one plate of it. The also have mix plates if you want to try more than one menu item."}
{"text":"When we first came to this spot from the referral of my Mexican coworker who loves Filipino food, it was really good. But after a couple of times it became a hit and miss for us. Granted, not to toot my own horn, but I can cook the hell out of some Filipino dishes, it became a bit lackluster when we tried other dishes. We like the kare-kare. It's creamy and very tasteful. The Thelma special left me wanting, there just wasn't enough pork and not a whole lot of taste. The pork longganisa is pretty good, but I liked my well done, almost burnt because I hate that gamey taste.   We went there today for some bangus (milk fish) since it's good Friday and it was the closest place that had bangus around our neck of the woods. The bangus was good, but we also got some garlic fried rice and my wife got a spam musubi. The garlic fried rice was really greasy and mushy and there was no taste of garlic, just saturated with oil. Also the spam musubi had no sauce. So we paid for spam and rice in seaweed. Ew! So it was just really disappointing and I feel sick from all that oil.  I hope they get their chef straightened up!"}
{"text":"If you live in Las Vegas, there's never a shortage of Filipino restaurants.  First time to check out this joint. Came here for lunch. It's a spacious  and clean restaurant. We ordered pompano sinigang soup (fish sour soup), Thelma's special Lechon kawali (deep fried pork) with chopped onions and sliced tomatoes, and the recommended adobo fried rice.  The sinigang soup was cooked with lots of chopped tomatoes that the broth turned a little darker. Quite different than the the original recipe but it works, it tasted great!  Pompano fish  was really fresh. Thelma's special Lechon kawali is a seasoned deep fried pork belly (chopped) served with fresh diced onions, and fresh tomatoes lightly seasoned with soy sauce and vinegar.  The pork  and fried skin was equally portioned, meat was tender and seasoned perfectly. This was my favorite and tasted authentic!  The adobo rice was mild to taste and popular. If you say adobo even if mixed and cooked as fried rice, I was expecting a well seasoned, deeper and richer flavor  with a hint of garlic, this Adobo fried  rice was below my expectations. Just needs a little tweaking.  Overall: clean restaurant, You order and they cook it fresh, price is reasonable, and served fast. Pleasant, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Sometimes I get lazy and I don't want to cook Filipino food so I go out and try places. Then I realized I should have just cooked at home. I ate here a couple years ago but it was ok. I had the breakfast topsilog. Beef with garlic fried rice and egg.   Now, I had the 3 item lunch plate with steam rice, pancit mix(no flavor), chicken adobo (pale in color and soaking in oil...greasy!!!) and dinuguan (pork blood stew) very dry and thick it needed flavor. very bland. Also i ordered shanghai lumpia which was the best of all !!!!  It is also a hawaiian restaurant. Service is ok but WHY WHY WHY is it that most Filipino restaurants in town are hot AF!?!?! They have fans running but it seems like they raise the temp to save $ and use fan to cool the place. It just circulates the hot air. It is uncomfortable to dine in."}
{"text":"You gotta try it!!! SOO GOOD! Thelma's Special is to die for!  What to try: Thelma's Special Pork Adobo Fried rice with the fried egg on top Chicken Adobo Pancit Kare-Kare   MMMMm Good! I went there 2 days in a row...and loved it every time. The best Filipino food I've had in Vegas so far! I'm glad its in henderson!! Forget, trying to drive out to Spring Mountain or Maryland...after a day shopping at Galleria, just drive over. I think Thelma's will close down Aloha Kitchen on the other side! hahaha! JK!"}
{"text":"When we go to Vegas to lose our money we always end up eating here to be comforted.   If you cannot get rich, at least get fat."}
{"text":"Just like the one back home in Waipahu. Top notch Filipino grinds!  Always need to get te Thelma's special!!"}
{"text":"Soooo delicious. The staff is so friendly and patient. The food is amazing. I definitely found one of my favorite Filipino restaurants of all time. It's the wait time for the food that is a little depressing but the food really makes up for it."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful! Really well-priced. Great service. Very, very good food! You can order kind of a \"sampler platter\" and get to try different things, which is what we did. The Thelma's Special was AWESOME. I highly recommend this place. Food is much better and much cheaper than the strip!"}
{"text":"They redeemed themselves tonight. Great service, quick and everything tasted \"masarap\"! Try their \"coco-nana\" dessert. Banana bread and coconut ice cream on top! Yum!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  My 2 star rating might contradict my first sentence, but the reason for my review is just to bring awareness to the business owners in reference to my last 2 visits at Thelmas.  The worst business mistake is inconsistency. I always order the Thelmas special when I go to Thelmas and the last 2 times i went it was HORRIBLE. Same issue with the Longanisa fried rice and Thelmas special musubi!  All I tasted was OIL. There was no flavor but OIL flavor. I couldn't eat it, I had to send it back and when they tried to \"fix it\", it was just as bad.  Could it be that there's a different chef?  Whatever the issue was I HOPE it gets fixed because I can't go on in life without the \"original\" Thelmas special; flavorful, crispy..... and perfect! Please stay consistant... thats what brings people back for more!"}
{"text":"This place ia great!  Super friendly, cheap, and most importantly TASTY!!!  It is hard to find.  It on the inner part of the corner of sunset and marks.  Between mattress discounters and rubios mexican grille."}
{"text":"good tasting food and clean restaurant. the service is quite slow but because they make the food fresh. good atmosphere, it will satisfy your craving if you are wanting to eat good filipino food. this is far from where i live, but we were on our way to lake las vegas, so it was a convenient stop. I like how they cook their meals because they are not oily."}
{"text":"I had the Thelma's lunch special (lechon with soy sauce, I think some vinegar, diced tomatoes and onions) and it was packed with flavor!  Surprisingly, the lechon skin was still crispy.  Includes 2 scoops of rice and a drink for $7.  Reasonably priced.  Their lumpia was good too."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on a Saturday morning. I came for their Thelma's special, but I also wanted to order the adobo fried rice omelet. However, the lady wouldn't let me order the Thelma's special a la carte. She was also rude & rushed me even though there was only one customer behind me, and I was the first customer of the day. The food itself was a DISAPPOINTMENT. I usually visit their original location back home in Waipahu, and that location is WAY BETTER than this one even though this one in Henderson is bigger & nicer.  Overall, a very POOR experience. If the cashier lady didn't rush me & was more flexible with the menu, I would have given this place 3 stars. Nevertheless, I'm never coming back to this location (as if they care). I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Expensive. Unfriendly staff. Do not order marinated bangus.  Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Authentic Filipino food that keeps having me come back for more.  My mom is Filipino, so this food is a nice home away from home. I was surprised at the amount of options they have. You could get your classic chicken adobo, pancit, dinuguan, langonisa sausage (greatest sausage ever), Iechon , etc. I recommend going in for the lunch special, because you can get a large amount of food for like $7. Depending what you order, you'll probably even get enough for leftovers. I would also add a sinegang soup to your order. They make it salty, but delicious.  If you've never had Filipino food before, my go to dish is the lechon. It's a pig roast with super crispy skin. In the Philippines we set the pig on the table and pick at the delicious skin before getting to the meat. At Thelma's, they'll chop it up for you so you'll get pieces with plenty of meat and skin...and fat."}
{"text":"Okay I am Filipino and I don't really eat Filipino food. The only place I eat Filipino food is either when my mom makes the Americanized version at home or at Thelma's in Waipahu. Even that is rare. I'd say the only time I eat Filipino food is during the holidays.  How ironic. Thelma's is in Vegas and I LOVE their Thelma's Special. It is so tasty and artery clogging but totally worth it. We went there to order a snack of fried rice for my nephew and dad and to put in our order for catering on Christmas Eve. Like I said their Thelma's Special is awesome! Other dishes we ordered were the pumpkin with pork, pork guisantes, and adobo fried rice. Everything was so good. My other favorite aside from the crispy pork is the adobo fried rice. Mmm!   Their prices are pretty reasonable too. The girls that work in the restaurant are super friendly and helpful. After leaving that restaurant all that was playing through my head was that \"Filipino Foods\" song."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and unfortunately this last visit was not as good.    Here's the disclaimer before I give you my review.  I'm from Hawaii, I know my filipino food, and I used to eat at The Thelma's in Waipahu.  Yes, at least once a week I'd pick up food for my co-workers.     I was in Vegas so I decided to stop by for a quick dinner.  I was excited because I haven't had Thelma's in years regardless that I go to Hawaii quite often.    Food:  I ordered the Thelma's special and Pork Sinigang.  The Thelma's special was far from what I remembered and very soggy.  :(  The pork sinigang lacked the sour flavor and had too much ginger taste.  I mean TOO much! :(   Tupac ordered the Bangus Sarciado and the cashier heard shrimp sarciado instead.  He told her I did not order that and I confirmed it too that he said bangus and she said no.  Whatever, Tupac was hungry and said he'll just eat it. I was like NO they should make what you ordered.  Oh well.  :(    Overall, the restaurant is clean. It's unfortunate though that I know how good the dishes are since I've been eating at the Waipahu location for years.  This Thelma's disappointed me and I know it was probably the different cooks."}
{"text":"I remember going to Thelma's in Waipahu. My aunty loved them and we would always be there at least 2-3x months. She called to tell me that they were opening up in LV. Lately we've been going to Elena's but it is pretty far from us, and because of the Yelper's, now I don't have to drive that far.  Thelma's serves Illocano food and it is very familiar  and almost as good as Grandma's cooking. You read that right...ALMOSTas good as. LOL They have a good menu and offer either dishes or  combination plates. We ordered: Pinakbet, Pancit, Chicken adobo, and a Halo halo. They were all good especially the pinakbet- its been awhile since i had pinakbet.  The restaurant was very spacious and clean. You can't see the restaurant from Sunset Rd. or Marks St. But they are in same complex as Aloha Kitchen & Vitamin World across from Best Buy.  The service was also very good and the food came out quick. My little pinoy princess also got a free treat. Salamat!  I will definitely be going back very soon. Can't wait to try their breakfast menu.  Aloha!!"}
{"text":"I never knew of a Thelma's in Waipahu, but apparently it's popular enough to open up a store here in the 9th island.   I went 2 days ago to try it out and I am so glad I did!  Went there for the lunch special. $6.50 for your choice of entree, that comes with rice, mac salad, a drink, and fruit salad for dessert! WOW. I was already impressed when I saw that near the register. I opted for the PInakbet, and my boyfriend got the Thelma's Special. They had ran out of mac salad that day, but the friendly lady at the register offered to give us some mixed pancit in place of it. I was cool with that! So we pay and take our seats, and dabble in the ridiculous game shows that seem to be endlessly playing on Filipino channels... well that and then a drama shortly after!   We get our lunch plates, and they are decently sized! For 6.50 including a drink, I honestly think it's a steal!   I had a taste of my boyfriends Thelma's special and had to restrain my fork from ravaging his plate again! IT IS SO GOOD. I don't know about you guys, but that's the closest \"Lechon Kawali\" that I can get here in Vegas, and ALMOST identical to the dish I remember at my family parties in Hawaii! YUM  My pinakbet was... average, to say the least. The tastes were okay, I was expecting a very soupy dish, with A LOT of soft vegetables, but it was just okay. The eggplant in it had too tough/thick of a skin, and I just think it needed to be cooked a bit longer.  It's okay, we both finished our plates, down to the last rice grain! Then, our waitress came out with our fruit salad! Yay! Although it was a bit sweet for my taste buds, I am glad that it comes with some sort of dessert!  All in all, I would come back to this place to sample their other popular items! Service was great, and the restaurant was clean and inviting. Recommended for a fast, affordable meal."}
{"text":"Just like home. Food here is awesome. Staff treats you like family. There is plenty of room. Menu is huge! Love it! (Try the Thelma Special!)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service, and a nice neighborhood-family-friendly ambience. Did I mention the food is amazing?!? Sinigang, chicken papaya, adobo were all some of the best I've ever had! Thank you, Thelma's!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times already and it's probably one of my favorite Filipino places to eat.   I'm Filipino soooo I'm picky about my food if it's not my mom's haha. But she doesn't live here, so when I want my cravings satisfied I gotta do what I gotta do (sorry mom lol).   This place is clean and the staff is nice. It is a lot pricier than other Filipino restaurants but it's good, and I'll pay for good food. My favorite is the Thelma's special *drool* I always have it when I come and the flavors are just too hard to give up even when I know this dish is probably really bad for me haha. The lechon is always crunchy, I've never had it soggy and the veggies are always fresh. I love the longanisa here it's so good. And I always upgrade my white rice to garlic rice because that's the only way to do it. The silet is good, I asked for mine extra crunchy the last time I went it was a little bitter but it wasn't too bad when I dipped it in the chili water sauce. The sinigang soup is delicious, but not as sour as I like mine. Overall, I have found this place to come closest to my mom's cooking and I never have a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Naturally I'm picky about Filipino restaurants because I'll always compare it to my mom-in-law or grandma's cooking. I have been to Thelma's twice and I was a happy customer both times.  On my first visit, I was ordered Kare Kare (oxtail with veggies in a peanut sauce) and Thelma's special. I always order Kare Kare at every Filipino restaurant I go to because it's my favorite. I found it to be good but not the best I've had and with not enough meat (mind you, I said I was picky). Whenever I see a menu item labeled \"special\" I expect to be blown away. I thought Thelma's Special to be okay... I found the onions and tomatoes to be a little overpowering. Overall, I was pleased with the food and especially the service.  The next time I stopped by, I had a hankering for Crispy Pata (fried pork leg). To my dismay, that wasn't on the menu. I settled for the Lechon Kawali instead and Dinuguan (pork blood stew). At first glance, it looked like the servings were small but my husband and I were quite full and had enough leftovers for the next day. What really made me love Thelma's was the quality of the food. The Lechon Kawali had just enough crisp in the skin and was so flavorful. I had never had Dinuguan with so little fat. Usually other Filipino restaurants mix a lot of fat with the meat to be most cost efficient.   The restaurant itself is very clean and well kept. The service is warm and friendly. The prices are reasonable.  I only wish they had more items on their menu. Otherwise, Thelma's is a restaurant that I would go to again and again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful tasty filipino food, came here in March and had the traditional filipino breakfast with longanisa. It was so good we came back the next day. Third time in I had the Squid lunch special and was not disappointed?."}
{"text":"My wife and I drive 1 1/2 hours to eat some of the best Filipino food we have ever eaten. We love Thelma's for their food and service. We try to go here at least once every month!!!"}
{"text":"I've decided to try this place, finally, after recommendation from a fellow yelper to eat the Halo-Halo.  I went on a Wednesday evening, and was a bit disappointed that they didn't have my favorite dish, the binagoongan.  Gosh how hard it is to find that dish!  However, I thought the price of the menu items were quite fair.  We got the Lechon Kawaii, which was pretty crispy and yummy, w/ a big bowl of rice to accompany it.  We also ordered the mixed plate, which we chose the following four items (there is a list of items one may chose):  -Pork Adobo:  It was tasty, like any other places, just less sauce...I like my sauce too. -Pancit Mix:  I should have stick with my favorite Pancit...Pancit Palabok -Dinuguan: Pretty good.  Don't let the blackish/purplish color scared you...pretty delicious -Thelma Special:  This dish includes chunks of lechon mixed with diced tomatoes and onions.  Well, I learned quickly that I liked my lechon crisp and as is versus all the frills.    Then I was ready for my current favorite dessert..Halo Halo.  There was barely any ube icecream, and there was no rice crisp!  The rice crisp adds texture and I totally missed it.  I usually finish the whole halo-halo, no matter how full I am, but I only ate half and dumped the rest.  I was very very very disappointed. :(  The service was wonderful.  Our cashier/server was super friendly.  I probably will go back to try other items, but won't be ordering my halo-halo there (save myself from disappointment)."}
{"text":"Pretty Solid Filipino Food....Came here on opening day and was not dissappointed...Never tried the Thelma's back home in Hawaii, but this is second best to my Mom's cooking(Nobody beats Mom's cooking, right?) tried the Adobo fried rice, thelma's special, pancit, guisantes, diniguan, pumpkin guisado, and Halo-Halo for dessert... We even got free drinks and a Thelma's T-Shirt...Pretty Cool!"}
{"text":"the food is super cheap and the portions are filling. the chicken adobo isn't too tangy and the loganisa and spam breakfasts are comfort food good. i like the thelma's special with the onions/tomatoes/soy sauce, but the lechon kawali could be a bit fatty sometimes...not enough to lose a star, but just a heads up. i really like this place; they're also not nazi's with the fountain drinks and napkins. the bathrooms are super clean you can take a poop in there in peace and reflect on life (was that BA in art history really WORTH it??). filipino food is great yummy comfort food so if you're on a sissy atkins diet getting ready for bikini season at green valley ranch, it might not be for you. otherwise check it out because once you bite into a scrumptious lumpia you'll feel like you're in the philippines with manny pacquiao sitting on your lap playing you \"tiny bubbles\" on his mini ukulele. and that's not a typo a mini ukulele is an even SMALLER ukulele. so you've got a tiny boxer with a tiny tiny guitar. go to themla's - experience the jungle magic."}
{"text":"Been coming here for I don't know how long now (back home and here) and although a good friend of mines always orders their tapsilog, I've usually just ordered Thelma's Special along with the usual adobo, etc - call me a creature of habit =|  I've been on a BANGSILOG binge lately and it never occurred to me that Thelma's has this. And what an idiot of me to not have tried it sooner :(  Literally came at opening on a Sunday (11:30am) and was the 5th person in line --- THAT busy, already!!!!   Wanted to wait on the rest of my party of 7 but, didn't -_- I was hungry, ok!!!!!?!!!!!  Order my milkfish (bangus) with over easy egg and garlic fried rice.   That bangus had to have been my favorite out of all the bangus I've tried here in Vegas! It had to have been marinated for a long time because it was super tender and sweet. Not fried too much which is always good and healthy ;p If I didn't have the vinegar, fish would've been just as tasty.  But, let's be honest, I'm a vinegar lover so that BadBoy, along with my rice, was swimming in Binegar **pinay accent**  I neeeeeeeddddddd to go back and order two! Just for me!!!!!  But, why you gotta be so far, Thelma?! WHYYYYY :("}
{"text":"I went to check this place out after work on Saturday for dinner.  They have quite a selection of Filipino entrees but, to my surprise, they have a few Hawaiian dishes as well.  Plus, their combo plates were a mix of both Filipino and Hawaiian styles which is appealing to me on many levels.  The thing I liked about Thelma's is that I can get breakfast at any time of the day!  They have about 4 or 5 breakfast entrees ready to go whenever the mood strikes.  I am a huge fan of the breakfast-all-day concept and I ultimately ended up going with one of their omelettes.  The omelet itself was pretty standard except that the omelet came with rice instead of hash browns!  It was a nice throwback to my younger days in Hawaii.  They also use Aloha Shoyu (I was surprised that the waitress offered \"Shoyu\" NOT \"Soy Sauce\" :) ) here and anywhere that serves Aloha Shoyu is alright in my book.  Good restaurant but not a lot of vegetarian dishes but I didn't expect anything like that here because I'm pretty positive that there are not a lot of  vegetarian Hawaiians (like myself) or even vegetarian Filipinos out there.  But, I'm sure I will see Thelma's again.. In the meanwhile I hope they get more seafood or veggie dishes to cater to my \"habit\"."}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.  DISLIKE  Only location is half an hour away from where I live.  LIKE  The lunch special. The food selection. The shrimp omelet. The fried rice. Thelma's special.  LOVE  The homemade taste."}
{"text":"Salamat ate thelma for your Sarap dinuguan and for playing one more chance on the teebee. Very clean restaurant and large space great for karaoke parties. Bring your nanay, Tatay, kuya, ate, Lolo, Lola, Tito, Tita and anaks here. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Just got take out.  It was great.  Ordered the Thelma's Special and Chicken Tocino.  I look forward to more trips here!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times but haven't really wrote a review about it. This place is really good. The place is not a buffet style you actually order from the menu and they do have it to go too. The place was clean and comfy the staff seems like she does everything from taking your order to cashier to clean the tables and bringing your drinks. any ways my fave dish was the thelma's special its bascially lechon chopped into cubes with onions and tomato and the seasoning.  the portions were pretty good and can could feed about 2 or 3 people. i definitely would make this my to go spot when im craving lechon!"}
{"text":"My recommendation: Chicken Adobo Fried Rice  Hands down, best thing about this place is the Chicken Adobo.   They are very generous with their portions. The \"mini\" is enough to feed 3 or 4 people.   The customer service at the counter is great. Everyone is so friendly and always smiling. They don't bother you once they bring your food to the table. They let you just relax and enjoy your meal.   I love this place! That adobo has me coming back weekly."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we've been back.  Quite honestly the last time was not something to write about but my last visit was something I could compare to.  We walked in around 300p and it was quite empty and only one person in the restaurant.  So we walked up to the counter where the menu was at and placed our order.  It probably took about 10 minutes before the first of our orders came out.  I have to say, it was well worth the wait.  My son had mungo beans with marungay (very flavorful),  while the others had the Thelma's special, igado, pancit, squid guisado, dinaguan.  The food was piping hot and you could tell it wasn't sitting and being reheated.  Hats off to the chef, even my husband commented that this visit was way better than our last.  Now we have another go-to place to stop in.  When your in the Henderson area of Las Vegas give them a try!"}
{"text":"I really hope this place never closes. I go there so much they know my order and let me tell you something, it is exactly the way I want it EVERYTIME! I could not be more happy with the food selection there and the staff is wonderful! It's really the only place in Henderson with authentic pancit."}
{"text":"Since I was shopping in the area, my friend and I got very hungry and since this place had 4 stars & we love Filipino food, decided to come here.  Ordered the combo with pinakbet & dinuguan. The two scoops of rice was very small, like little ice cream scoops. The food did not fill me up. Out of all the Filipino restaurants I've been to, this place has the smallest serving. Pinakbet was basically boiled veggies with fish sauce, lacked flavor. Dinuguan wasn't flavorful either... I usually taste vinegar but this had none. Whomp.  I also tried my friends sides as well, squid and the special which had lechon, tomatoes and onion. Nothing special.   Also order the lechon kawali musubi and I rather just stick to the regular musubi with spam.  Nothing special about this place and the food wasn't that great. Nothing really stood out to me. When you're really hungry, the food you eat usually satisfy you... But I wasn't happy when I left, I wish I went across the street to famous daves or something that would've satisfy my hunger."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service... Not so great. Being Filipino myself I know how WE can be but regardless, if you have a customer standing at the counter, don't ignore him and carry on your conversation until it's convenient for you. Just rude.   Otherwise, food was good. Lumpia was small but still tasty. Pork adobo was flavorful. Lechon kawali was nice and crispy but would've liked some lechon sauce on the side. And seriously? two scoops of rice per entree? #needmorerice"}
{"text":"Since this is the best Filipino food I've had in the Las Vegas area I'll have to give this place a high end 4-star.  Plus, their sister restaurant is Julie'z at Kapolei, HI.  Their lechon kawali isn't like Julie'z though...just as good, but different.  This restaurant is right near the Sunset Station Casino.  Sometimes it's nice to get away from all the buffets and glitzy restaurants of The Strip so when those times come we like to go here.  Comfort food that reminds me of home.  The food here is as good as it gets for Filipino cuisine.  The best deal in the house has to be their 4 item mix combo though.  You get a wide selection and the portions are decent for the price you pay (around $9).  I especially like the way they cook their dinuguan, pancit, and the broth for the oxtail soup.  The food here is delicious, the customer service is friendly, and the restaurant is roomy.  Great place for something different."}
{"text":"It's not often I'm this far out in Henderson especially to eat, but Thelma's was a pleasant surprise. We ordered pork sinigang, arroz caldo, and spam musubi. All were good, but my daughter felt the musubi was pre-made and heated up because the seaweed wasn't fresh. Believe me, she is an expert when it comes to musubi.  I would have given it 4 stars, but it's true from past reviews the AC is either not on or on low. Be sure to sit under one of their ceiling fans so it is bearable. So if you must eat Filipino food in this area of Vegas, I would say you'll be ok visiting Thelma's."}
{"text":"Man, F this place.....FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF this place!!!  What the hell are all of you thinking? I feel like I was just robbed of $25 for some sub-par mediocre longonisa, thelma's lechon special and shanghai lumpia....NO.  Absolutely NEVER EVER EVER again.  If this place was once good - it's sure is not anymore. I ordered pick-up and the girl who took my order was the sweetest thing, but the food is horrible.....this was my first time trying this place and with the reviews I've read I was expecting them to be at least as good as my favorite spot near Siena hospital - but sadly they failed miserably and I can't even believe I wanted to compare the two with one another. My husband loves longonisa, but one bite into one of six pieces, he stopped and put the rest on my plate and said he can't finish it because the taste makes him want to vomit.  I felt soooooo bad - he asked me to pick this specific dish up and I should've just went to our usual spot.  Then, the overly onion-saturated special ruined the other entree - and what was up with the lechon pieces all having no meat??  The pieces were cut up as small as the diced tomatoes and onions and was pure skin and fat.  REALLY? Like whoever was going to eat this dish wouldn't notice there was no meat? I honestly do not know what everyone likes here.  7pm when i walked in and the place was completely empty....there was a non-appealing smell coming from the kitchen area too and I felt really bad and sad for them, but now after tasting what they have to offer, I too will be added to the list of non-existent customers for this place. Oh, and the shanghai lumpia was cold....not cold like it was just sitting around for a while - like cold, not cooked all the way through in the middle cold.  Yeah, like I said - FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF this place.  You all can have it."}
{"text":"I grew up eating at Thelma's with my family and after moving to the mainland the one thing I missed, aside from local Hawaiian food, was good Filipino food. On a recent trip to Vegas, I remembered the Thelma's that opened last year so naturally the Filipino in me really wanted to stop by. The Thelma's special is A MUST. We ordered that, shrimp sinigang and pork adobo fried rice. All of which tasted soooo good! Can't wait to go back to see if their kare kare tastes just as good!"}
{"text":"Just here for the inlaws, they enjoyed it.  But they lacked some variety.. or maybe just the dishes i enjoy weren't there. Till next time Thelma."}
{"text":"Thelma's. Everytime the parents are in town we have to go there, even though they could go to Waipahu. Lol. I like the adobo fried rice omelet, adobo loco moco and their pancit.  The hubby and mom always gets Thelma's special (lechon kawali). Dad eats the dinuguan (blood). The service can be slow sometimes, but usually friendly. Family owned and operated, always good to support businesses like this."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out and waited for some time, only because we had a big order. If you check-in on Yelp you get 10% off. The lady at the counter was nice. Can't really write a full review because we never sat down and ate but the location was bigger and cleaner than the Waipahu location."}
{"text":"Literally waited over 35 minutes for our order to go . When we asked what was taken so long , the cashier was uncertain and came back to ask us what we ordered . Twice she passed by us and said it's almost ready , yet we waited another 10 minutes . Worse service ever !! I will not be returning ."}
{"text":"Yummy comfort food. Chicken adobo, garlic fried rice, boneless bangus, crispy pork, beefstek....everything amazing. AND for dessert, I love their halo halo with ube ice cream."}
{"text":"Awesome Filipino food... Must try thelma's special and adobo fried rice!"}
{"text":"There's a lot of Filipino restaurants in Henderson but we usually go to this place whenever we're craving Filipino food. They have a pretty big menu and they're able to still quickly make your food fresh after you order it. The staff are very friendly and the place is clean and spacious. Ive never seen this place empty which means a lot of other locals like the place. Parking is very easy to find and access."}
{"text":"We almost didn't find this place and gave up, but I'm glad we didn't. I didn't know what Adobos were until this day and wow if I could I would eat it every day:) It was very very tasty and my mouth is watering thinking about it right now. If I'm in that area again, I will definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"My family would love Thelma's and give them 5 stars.  Me...not that much.  Tough for me to give Thelma's more than 4 stars because I am really picky when it comes to Filipino Food.  I grew up on this food and still think dad's cooking is 2nd to none.  I'm also from San Diego and lived 15 minutes from National City.  If you know National City, you know that's there's Tita's Kitchenette, Zarlito's, and Point Point Joint.  All tough acts to follow.    I still give this place 4 stars for the clean restaurant, great service, selection, and decent food. Out of everything I've tried here, I have to say that their Adobo Fried Rice is very good.    Sometimes service takes awhile and sometimes it's quick.  Located on the opposite end from where I live so its tough to even find the energy to drive out here for their food.  But if I'm in the area and in the mood for their Adobo Fried Rice, I will definitely make a stop.  Wish List:  Too bad they don't have Chicken BBQ on a stick.  One of those things I miss and have yet to find a good one out here."}
{"text":"Great authentic Filipino dish! Friendly and helpful staff. I enjoy the food. It is like being home."}
{"text":"Finally had lechon...for a southern girl this is one of those must try dishes that I just learned about fairly recently...and have been trying to figure out when and where to have it...   Don't get me wrong with 3 star review...the place was super clean, large, pretty empty when we arrived and everything felt made to order, which was surprising since it's counter service.    For all you wondering what I mean and if this is worthy of your attention...we are talking pork belly, simply seasoned, cooked somehow so that the skin is uber crispy think shingle and the meat/fat is tender and simply porky...it comes with slivered and soaked whit onion and a sticky sweet dipping sauce that was oddly addictive yet unidentifiable to both my husband and me.    I have a strange love for Hawaiian Mac salad...don't ask me why because I find most, including pseudo Italian pasta salads revulsive...this was just ok.    The \"mini\" chicken adobo fried rice we ordered was actually pork... No complaints tho because it was tasty but what my husband and I both craved with these fat heavy dishes was acidity...crisp, clean, palate cleansing flavors that would lighten each dish and make it sing...   Lime, lemon?  Not sure...  But this is definitely a cuisine/culture worthy of exploration...its rich history due to the influences imposed upon its people and the large number of Filipinos here in LV, give us a unique opportunity for exploration and experimentation."}
{"text":"Tried the Thelma's Special again... Soggy and lots of fat!  Is it the weather here in Vegas?  Do you need the humidity of Waipahu?  It's just not the same.  Nothing beats Waipahu."}
{"text":"My husband is Filipino and we both just love Thelma's. I get the chicken adobo fried rice and he gets the pork adobo fried rice and they are absolutely delicious!! Perfect seasoning, large portions and decent price!!! We have even brought some of his family and they all loved it as well."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. The food is quite authentic and the variety is great. My hubby truly enjoys Thelma's Special. The first time I brought my mother she was quite impressed with the food. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good! Atmosphere was nice & quiet...my first time going there since it opened in Henderson. I didn't quite like Thelmas Special, I think Elena's was the best i've tasted! But, I'd go back!! Prices are reasonable, The workers are very nice & check up on you every now and then! Yes, I am I Fan!!!"}
{"text":"Omg please don't come to this place, just go to seafood city and make your own Filipino food for they will be done at the same time, shopping plus cooking! An order of bangus sinigang took 45 minutes to come out?!! It would've been ok if it was good but it wasn't, I know I'm a bad cook but i can cook better sinigang than this!!! So so very disappointed!"}
{"text":"BEST Filipino food in Las Vegas!!! Well, in my humble opinion, it most definitely is:o) Location is in Henderson so it's away from the hustle and bustle at the strip. I've had the adobo fried rice (chicken & pork), lumpia Shanghai and I made sure that I ordered the Thelma's Special, which is lechon kawali, sautéed in tomatoes, onions and sauces.   The restaurant alone is not fancy, but has that \"Filipino home vibe\" and there is plenty of seating. It's never really crowded whenever I go and the service is always good. Although I live in Centennial Hills and is quite a drive, it won't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"I'm extremely upset that Thelma's, one of my favorite places seems to be going downhill in quality. I guess times are tough, so instead of working on bringing in more business they've decided to put up hand written signs on their soda fountain  telling you \"one drink per person limit. No refills if you're sharing.\" Nobody in Vegas does this. Then my food portions are smaller. Ridiculous! You guys are going to keep losing business with those poor practices. Businesses don't thrive when cutting costs. They thrive when bringing in more business. You can't bring in more business by telling people not to share drinks."}
{"text":"I have to start this review by saying that I hate Filipino food at restaurants. I grew up with the traditional Filipino mom who made a home cooked Filipino meal every night. So my expectatios are really high. Restaurant Filipino food tends to be on the bland side to cater to everyone. I'm used to all the fatty, salty, greasy deliciousness.   My family lives in California so I don't get to eat as much Filipino food as I would like to. However, the craving can get overwhelming at times. So where do I go?!?! Here!!!  This is the closest it gets to Filipino home cooking. Everything I've eaten always comes out piping hot and fresh. Everything is flavored correctly. I haven't tried anything that I didn't like. My favorites are kare kare (oxtail and vegetables cooked in a peanut butter broth served with shrimp paste) and Thelma's special (pieces of lechon with tomatoes and onions served with special sauce). All sounds off if you aren't used to it, but trust me it is delicious. Only reason why I docked a star is because this isn't my mom's cooking, but it satisfies the need."}
{"text":"food is great! try the shoyu chicken with the adobo fried rice. :D"}
{"text":"This is the closest I've ever gotten to real authentic Filipino food.  Growing up in Hawaii, has given me the big Filipino/Hawaiian/Japanese impact.  Our culture is a mix plate of cultures, and this place executes the flavors of both Hawaii and Philippines so well.    The atmosphere of this restaurant is soooo welcoming, it gives me a sense of \"HOMEY\" feeling.  I was surprised with the cleanliness of the restaurant, I was expecting the same \"ELENA'S\" surrounding.    I ordered the mix plate which consisted of: - Pancit Mix - Almost close to my mother's home cooking.  A mixture of flavor, I personally thought it was Pancit heaven.   - Pinakbet - I've been having cravings of my mother's pinakbet ever since I left home.  While this was somewhat close, the vegetables my mother usually added weren't there.  It was good regardless, and the flavor of the patis sauce was there to.  I loved how it was the \"ILOKANO\" way of making pinakbet, as opposed to the Tagalog way of adding shrimp paste.   - Thelma's special - Wow I've been looking everywhere for this.  It's basically Lechon kawali soaked in soy sauce, onions, and tomatoes.  Mines was a little on the \"oniony\" side, but it was definitely delicious.  My dad usually makes this dish using the head of the pig and BBQing it, then chopping it into pieces while adding cow brains, oninos, tomatoes, vinegar, and soy sauce.    I would definitely say, this is by far one of the BEST FILIPINO foods I've had in Vegas.  Getting the Thelma's Special is a must!"}
{"text":"I have only ordered the Shanghai Lumpia here. But the service was really great and the people are sweet. They packed it up well for easy carrying and traveling along with a goo amount o the sweet and spicy sauce, and vinegar sauce as well. The Lumpia is not the best I've had... Come on, if you are Filipino you know at least one of your auntie's makes it way better. But this is one of the best Lumpia I've had at a restaurant, admittedly I've only had from maybe 5 or so other restaurants"}
{"text":"Everyone is really nice here. The food is ok(doesnt taste as fresh). I've had better. Its not my choice of filipino food but because its close to where i live so i come here. Their waipahu location is on point(i can taste the freshness), so it makes a total difference to me."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Filipino food, and I'd say that it was a great place to start. My boyfriend and I picked this place for a change of pace from the stuff on the strip. We ordered 2 orders of the Shanghai Lumpia, Chicken Adobo, and Chicken Adobo Fried Rice. I was worried that two orders of the lumpia might be too much since they came with six pieces each. However, when I tried the lumpia, I did not want to share my order. They were deliciously crunchy and the filling was well seasoned and they came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. I was anticipating them to be soggy after the 15 minute ride home, but they were still warm and crispy. My boyfriend had the adobo and he said that it was pretty good, but the sauce was too thin. When I tried it, it thought the chicken was a little dry, which also translated into the chicken in the fried rice. The fried rice dish on a whole was pretty good. It was made with short grain rice and green onions. It was tasty and came with two eggs on top. I asked for them over easy, but one of them must have broken and was overdone.   The restaurant was very casual and though our food took a while to come out, it was freshly made. The items added up and the bill ended up higher than I expected. It was a good meal overall and I look forward to trying more Filipino food."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm from Texas and we just don't have great Filipino restaurants like this! Just like my mom's cooking!"}
{"text":"Greeted with smiles and laughter. The menu is a bit small for my bad eyes, but still clearly posted in several places.   Boyfriend and I ordered Chicken  Adobo lunch specials with a side of garlic rice to split. Our food came out quickly, prices are pretty great.   ... Oh goodness. I've never had Philippino food before so, this was a GREAT place to pop that cherry. Chicken fell right off the bone. It was so delicious. I will absolutely be returning."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place gets 4 stars. The food quality is on par with pinoy pinay, but the portion is so small and over-priced. No wonder this place is so empty."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from my Caucasian co-workers who frequent Thelma's and they love it!   It's a little far of a drive for me but when I'm in the area I'll be sure to fix my Filipino Food craving with this. They're not \"turo-turo\" style unlike most Filipino fast food so their food tastes a little more fresh and like home. It's not too oily and has pretty good flavor.   I ordered to go and waited about 10 mins for my chicken adobo and sinigang soup. For one order of adobo I got 4 large chicken thighs-- I feel like I could've cooked this myself for $5 (in terms of quantity) but alas you do pay for convenience. The sinigang was delicious-- definitely was the base to a fish sinigang.   I think it's one of my better choices for Filipino food here in town."}
{"text":"Great!  Don't be afraid to experiment, with food combos you are not familiar with.  Great food, very friendly - lots of local Filipinos!  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Great Filipino food from Hawaii. Around $10 a person but worth it. I always leave full and the service is always great. Food is consistent. First timers must try adobo fried rice, Thelma's special and (sweet) longanisa"}
{"text":"Years ago, my fam bam tried this pinoy restaurant, I wasn't disappointed in what they had to offer.  You all have to try there lechon, it is crunchy, juicy and delicious."}
{"text":"I traveled all the way to Henderson to try some authentic Filipino food. It was a drive but it was worth it! I liked the fact that you can get combo plates here and they serve mac salad. I enjoyed the  variety because I can have a little of everything .  I ordered the pancit,  pork adobo and the lechon. The lechon had tomatoes and onions on top. I loved that because it reminded me of when my would make it and we would put it on top of our rice. The pancit was made with the thin crystal noodles just the way I like it. The pork adobo was also tender and flavorful.  It satisfied my craving for my mom's cooking!   My husband on the other hand doesn't eat a lot of ethnic foods so it was hard for him to order. I did some pre research on Yelp for him before we went. They had a banana bread dessert with coconut ice cream that I thought would be good for him but they didn't serve that the day we went. Then he picked halo halo . I explained that they put different things in Halo Halo that he may not like. When the cashier explained the ingredients he passed on that. He ended up ordering the mac salad and garlic rice. Of course I took some off his plate. ( strictly for research purposes lol) They were both delicious! If you are in Henderson and want Filipino food  this is definitely the place to be!!"}
{"text":"I know what you may be thinking, will I like Filipino food? Thelma's is amazing. Can't remember the name of the soup, but it is the vegetable side soup (a few bucks) it is sour and I licked the cup. Amazing flavor and so well balanced. My fish was cooked to perfection and the garlic rice was spot on. I got to talk with Thelma's daughter Loraine (not sure of the spelling), but such a kind person. She clearly loves to cook and takes pride in what is served. I'm from Madison Wisconsin and tonight felt like I was apart of Thelma's dinner table. Just an FYI, the directions took me to the wrong spot. Look at the map and follow the blue dot....thee buildings down from where the directions took me. Can't wait until my next visit."}
{"text":"I like to eat Filipino food and this is the first restaurant I found in Henderson and my dish was tilapia and spam musubi be in sinigang. My fish didn't look like it was freshly baked and my spam musubi tasted like it was store bought. Everything looks like it was homemade but after I eat my plate I was not satisfied with my experience."}
{"text":"I have to try this restaurant because of the great reviews I read, but was disappointed.  I ordered Thelma's Special and nothing really special with lechon kawali and some slices tomatoes with soy sauce on the side.  I also tried pork adobo and it was watery, not the way I wanted it to be.  I recycled it the next day and it turn out tastier than when I got it from them.  They also doubled charge me with the rice when, I didn't even ordered it.  Oh well, At least I gave it a try, 2 times.  I don't think I'm going back there ever again.  Sorry Thelma!"}
{"text":"Wow. This has instantly become my favorite Filipino restaurant. I first heard about this place a while ago from my coworker. I wish it didn't take me so long to finally go.  Since I'm not in the area much, I figured I'd try as many things as possible. I went with a four-item combo consisting of Mongo, Pinapaitan, Thelma's Special, and Pork Adobo. Of course, I added a small bowl of Sinigang for $1.  The Mongo intrigued me because it's Ilocano style, which I've never tried before. It's less soupy than the Mongo I'm used to. In addition, it's white as opposed to green. But more importantly, it was delicious.  Pinapaitan isn't something that would normally interest me. I don't like bitter dishes and the name screams bitter. Thankfully, the lady told me their version is more mainstream. And I do love tripe. The end result is very good, but I can still taste the bitterness obviously.  Thelma's Special is basically lechon with onions and tomatoes. It's pretty hard to screw this up and they certainly don't. Delicious.  As for the Adobo, this was the one thing I ordered that is probably the most ordinary. The large chunks of pork didn't really look like they would be tender, but they indeed were, surprisingly.  Make sure you check in before you order so that you get your 10% off. I actually forgot, but then when I mentioned it to the lady, she was totally willing to redo my ticket and give me the 10% off. I saved a whole 95 cents! It pays to pay with cash sometimes."}
{"text":"This past Tuesday, I was feeling adventurous in dining. I wanted to try someplace new. I set out for a dining adventure at Thelma's Filipino Restaurant. What really made this adventurous dining is that this was my first meal in a Filipino Restaurant. My real-life and Yelp friend Shirley. B would be my adventure guide in my very first dining experience in a Filipino restaurant. In similar style to a first-rate adventure guide, Shirley. B did some research on the food that I appreciate. She concluded that I have reviewed plenty of Chinese restaurants. Consequently,she matched three of the four items with an entree and appetizers that I have ordered in Chinese restaurants. We shared a plate of pancit mix (similar to chow mien noodles), beef vegetable lumpias (similar to egg rolls), garlic fried rice, and BBQ pork on sticks. Thelma's makes sharing easy. They provided serving spoons and extra plates to share the food. This eliminated the worry about germs that many diners have. Thelma also made the pace of dining relaxed by bringing out the different items separately. My favorite item was the pancit mix. If I wasn't dining here with Shirley. B, from looking at the pictures that yelpers posted, the pancit mix and the garlic fried rice would have been the dishes I ordered. Although, pancit mix is a different entree than noodle style chow mien,it was just as delicious. Anchoring each side of the plate was a lemon, that I did not need to squeeze to add flavor to the noodles. What can I really say about garlic fried rice besides it tasting similar to white rice with a garlic flavor? The lumpias tasted similar to the delectable egg rolls that are my usual appetizer before the entree. Finally, the BBQ pork sticks tasted similar to the BBQ food that I have enjoyed in L&L BBQ. I tasted the quality in each bite of the meat that was more taste than messiness. Complimenting the food was bottomless cola.     The trail-head for this dining adventure is a restaurant located in a small strip mall in the shadow of the colossal Sunset Station Casino & Hotel. It is off Sunset Road just west of the Marks Street traffic signal and Gold Rush Casino. Thelma's faces the Sunset Station Hotel and Casino. The inside of Thelma's looks more similar to L&L BBQ than an elegant restaurant. The elegance is the deliciousness of the food. To kick off this dining adventure, there are menus along a partition separating the cue from the kitchen. It is in a spot where nobody is watching over you, and you can take your time. The adventure initiates when you order your food and pay. If you are drinking a soft drink, they hand you a cup that you serve yourself. Ultimately they deliver the food for your dining adventure.     In my opinion yelping is about being an adventurist in dining that tries new places, then shares them through reviewing. Its very similar to the concept of living life as an adventure. In my pursuit of living life as an adventure I will occasionally step out of my comfort zone by trying cuisines and restaurants that I never experienced, then ultimately sharing  these experiences. With that said, \"Thank you Shirley. B for being a fantastic guide in adventurous dining.\""}
{"text":"Most Filipino restaurants are buffet or turo turo style, which works well for the target market of cost conscious Filipinos. However, that leads to mediocre food. That's where Thelma's comes into play. The best Filipino food in Vegas, period.  Thelma's is a casual sit down Filipino restaurant where you order at the counter and food is later brought out to you. It has most of the Filipino standards, as well as a few Hawaiian dishes with a Filipino twist. At my most recent visit, I had the Adobo Loco Moco. The adobo broth had a great balance of soy sauce to vinegar and was delicious. Every other dish I've had here has been on point.  The dining area is clean and it looks like a legitimate establishment. There are some Filipino restaurants that I would hesitate bringing a non-Filipino friend to, but not here. Thelma's isn't groundbreaking with its decor, but it's a place that won't have you worrying about health code violations.  Prices are a tad more than what you'd pay at a buffet or turo turo style Filipino restaurant, but it is still a solid value and is more than made up for by the increased food quality."}
{"text":"Inattentive to customers who call and even in person. 25 minutes from when I called and got hung up on to when I walked through the door they couldn't tell me how long it would take for the order to be done.it didn't even appear busy literally one dine in was seated.  Don't come here unless you have a solid 35 mins to waste waiting for food and don't try and call ahead because they will hang up. The food could taste like gold -and trust me it didn't it was a c minus at best -but the customer service is so poor I wouldn't waste your time-literally."}
{"text":"As long as I had to wait for my food to come out, I thought it was gonna be amazing. I'm just glad I did not introduce somebody to Filipino food at this place,i would have been embarrassed. Maybe I just went on a day they were experimenting on flavors."}
{"text":"Wait is a bit but worth the portion and quality comfort food. Definitely not fast food. Just like Lolas (grandmother) cooking."}
{"text":"Came for lunch , workers are nice! My boyfriend orders the adobo fried rice , I ordered the shoyu chicken and the shout chicken was not so good ."}
{"text":"First time in here! When you entered, the interior was like classic local Pinoy resto with bamboos' interior here and there. Super busy everyday, but the services and the foods came fast! So many customers came, most of them older, which is the sign that this place is run well and have great reviews!  I ordered pampano sinigang, it was AWESOME!!! This is my new spot for sinigang resto! they served with a big bowl, if you are eat small portion, this portion is enough for two.  The mixed plate, you can choose 4 side dish and only $9.99 or less if you choose 3,2, or 1 side dish. I was so wanna try everything, so I tried 4 side dish, Man, that was A LOT, at least for me!   I love how they make Dinuguan which was little bit salty on my taste but still acceptable.  Thelma's special - This is a should try dish. I loved it! The flavor was perfect for me!  Adobo Chicken - Very nice soft meat yet enough salt flavor if you eat it with rice.  Pancit mix - This one, surprisingly, the taste was fine, almost bland. But no worries, coz they have shiracha and soy on the table near cashier :).  Overall, I would love to go back to try something else! Very recommended it!"}
{"text":"Thelma's is a really good restaurant to go to if you're in the mood for Filipino food. The prices are reasonable and the portions are a good size. They have a bunch of things to choose from like fried rice, sinigang, pancit, beef tapa, adobo and lots more. My personal favorite is the longganisa fried rice!"}
{"text":"Every time I drive out to Vegas I have to drop by Thelma's for some Pork Adobo Fried Rice.  Conveniently located across the street from Sunset Station.  Super Yummy comfort food."}
{"text":"I have heard of this restaurant awhile ago.  I also read good reviews about the place.  I donot know why it took me awhile to finally go and try it.   I took my son and daughter with me after going to church last Sunday. We were not disappointed.  Everything was so tasteful.   The beef asada was tender and flavorful.  The pinakbet has fresh veggies.  The bagoong was perfect.  The Thelma's specialwas something different.  It was crispy  pork and it had bit a delicious sauce. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is great, in a very casual atmosphere.  The value meal is a deal with multiple combinations, especially if dining alone.  I'm always amazed with the consistant availability paria of leaves for the variety of dishes.  The dinaguan, egado, squid guisado, are just some of the delectable meals always delicious.  I've patronized other Filipino restaurants in LV, but none were as satisfying as Thelma's."}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Nothing special.  Food was overpriced.  Spam musibi did not taste great. The rice was mushy and the whole thing fell apart after you picked it up and took one bite. I think they did not use the proper rice to make it.   Chicken adobo too salty,  and pinikbat was ok.  Squid was ok.  My kids usually love pancit but they barely took a few bites.  My kids didn't like the adobo either and usually that's their favorite food."}
{"text":"Man o man! I love me some filipino food!  My go-to filipino restaurant in henderson but its a mix of hawaiian so you get 2 in 1, been coming here since I moved here from the philippines.  Food is always fresh though they take their sweet time to cook it so who am I to complaining why it's taking forever right?  KARE-KARE - Just like how its cooked in the philippines Make sure you ask for more bagoong because it's a pretty big bowl, but 30% meat and 70% vegetables! Bummer PORK SINIGANG - I think they need to make it a bit sour but then again some people doesn't like it too sour so yah its good! The pork is not really pork its more of a beef so I don't know how to feel abou thtis lol but it's good even its not pure pork! ADOBO FRIED RICE(chicken) - Make sure you get over easy eggs on this, it's actually good! PORK ADOBO - Surprisingly, it's not good considering this is a famous dish!  SPAM MUSUBI - NO WORDS. PERFECT! How can you possibly ruin a spam musubi?  CONS Make sure you order some extra rice because this asian restaurant is weird on their rice! They're not generous at all! LOL but the customer service person is always in a good mood and not once they messed up my order.   So yes try this place!"}
{"text":"Whenever I have the crave for Filipino/Hawaii Fusion this is where it's at! I'm originally from Hawaii and the fusion between Filipino and Hawaii food are a perfect combination and no one can top it like Thelma's. I got the Thelma's Special which is basically chopped Pork deep fried and and marinated with their special sauce mixed with tomatoes and onions, also ordered a side of their Musubi A lovely addition to starting my day. Try it out for yourself they have tons of other delicious dishes and one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Food was good but not the best we have had. It's really hard to find but worth making the time to go there. Prices are low and they give lots of food. Clean with lots of seating."}
{"text":"I love the food .. came with my nephew and my bf i ordered him the spam friedrice and i ordered the munngo and lechon. . I have no complain"}
{"text":"Ordered the pork & fish sinigang... it tasted like the soup was ready made &  then they just added the meat in when its ordered so the meat tastes bland... doesn't absorb the sauce because they cook it separately... My dad went there last week and said the food wasn't good either... they take to many short cuts to save money... then the taste of the food suffers..."}
{"text":"I was heading to the mall nearby and decided to try Thelma's. My boyfriend and I were satisfied from the first bite! If it's your first time and want to try a little bit of everything, get the mix plate. Great service as well."}
{"text":"Okay so I have been to the location in Hawaii and was happy to know that on my visits here in Vegas I can now satisfy my tastebuds again with more of \"Thelmas Special\"(crunchy luau style pork in thelmas sauce). This place has something for everyone. It combines a great value on their entrees and even better is served up by some of the friendliest staff who really make you feel welcome! Give em' a try!!!"}
{"text":"This is the first Filipino food eatery I discovered when I moved to Henderson 3 years ago. Love the consistent taste of the food, the location and for the most part, the staff. Calling ahead for a to go order is best cause the wait can be sometimes lengthy. The atmosphere is average, overall pretty clean and quaint. Definitely a place to check out if you craving some good Filipino food."}
{"text":"Well this was a disappointment to say the least. We had high expectations from the reviews and ratings.  The pictures posted are really old and so are some of the reviews so take the into consideration.  We went as a family which included 4 filipinos that were craving authentic home made filipino food.  As expected the food was high in salt but this was more salt than needed for the cooking.  The menu selection was ok nothing great.  The duck wasn't very good. The lumpia seemed like the frozen kind you just heat up.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"This isn't your \"Nanay's Restaurant,\" that's for sure.  It's more like, your cool \"Ate's Resto!\"  We tried out Thelma's for lunch during our last venture into Vegas and Thelma's is like no other Filipino restaurant I've been to.  It's huge, it's clean, it's organized, it doesn't smell, it's not sticky and damn the food is good!  The one thing that irks me about your typical Filipino restaurant is that the food is sitting in a buffet of chaffing dishes behind a window where you have to point and ask, \"What's that?\"   Thelma's offers up a menu that is straight forward; pick an item or two, or three, with rice.    I had the Thelma's Special, which is kind of like, Sisig that married Tokwa't Baboy, which tasted okay, not sure I'd order it again.  I also had their Dinuguaan which was pretty damn tasty, gotta love my chocolate meat.  For my third item, I had the Chicken Adobo, which was pretty good, a little sweet, but good.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gWeYW0E5Tfmmj_9fugfLNw?select=Npu-vw7X5rs60Cvq9YhykA  Not sure if the lady helping us was Thelma herself but regardless, the lady was super sweet and always was smiling, which is quite refreshing rather than dealing with a grouchy Nanay who gives you a dirty look because you're speaking to her in English and not Tagalog.  But of course, what's a Filipino restaurant without TFC blaring on the TV?  What's sad is that we enjoyed our food while laughing at the corny and shamefully funny antics of this game show we were watching that when we got home, I just had to order TFC, damn you Thelma! :)  Definitely hit up Thelma's if you're in this part of town, or on your way to/from Sunset Station, no finger pointing here. ;)"}
{"text":"My favorite Ilocano restaurant Elenas is no longer open for business in Las Vegas :(. If me or my guy is craving tasty Ilocano Filipino food this is the only place in Las Vegas that has it. Which is why we come, it's either here or Hawaii and it's not too easy to get there. Hopefully soon enough we can finally move back to the 808 state and enjoy some legit Ilocano style Filipino food. That's another story so let's get to review about Thelma's.   Basically I have to settle for this food because all the other Filipino places are mostly Tagalog which is a different dialect, different style of cooking. We've been here to Thelma's several times but this last visit wasn't as good as our previous visits. The lechon  special was not fresh. You could tell it was cooked before and tasted old. The tapa was tough and kind of boring. The shoyu chicken is pretty good, pancit is pretty good too. Adobo is good but not as good as mine so I can just cook that at home. They have a soup here which is why I came today because I wasn't feeling so well. Chicken soup with long rice which is a clear noodle. Chicken broth flavored slightly with fish sauce cooked with ginger. I asked for bok choy to be added because I like vegetables. It was perfect. So comforting especially when you're not feeling well like I was or in the winter. Anytime really. I usually make at home but not in the mood when I'm sick. Overall Thelma's is a good option for Filipino if you prefer Ilocano style. Hopefully the lechon is more fresh next time because we don't eat it a lot and we do enjoy it."}
{"text":"I can't say I'm an expert when it comes to Filipino food, but this was really good!  I couldn't decide on what to get so I ordered the four item combo and was totally stuffed!  My four items:  Pancit noodles Chicken adobo Thelma's special Pork Gisantes  Do be advised they take visa/mc/discover but not Amex."}
{"text":"Thelma's is a pretty decent restaurant.  While the food was good, it still wasn't amazing or anything special at all.  And since I am Filipino, I have high standards for my motherland's food.  Their lechon kawali was pretty good.  It was crunchy and not crazy oily.  There was a good fat to meat ratio as well.  They had the standard mang tomas sauce to go with the dish, which is very much essential.  I also tried their pinapaitan too, which is a gingery stew, with tripe and beef/liver.  Again, it was good, but not great.  Their chicken adobo was ok. But, I am very particular with this dish, and so it has to have the right amount of soy sauce, vinegar, whole ground black peppers and perhaps maybe even coconut milk with a bay leaf thrown in, so I am of course biased.  I also tried the Thelma's special, which is just lechon with minced onions and tomatoes on top.  My visit to this place ended with the halo halo special, which could have been a bit sweeter. It was also lacking more toppings.  Oh, and their water had no taste, which is good, seriously.  Don't you dislike the taste of tap?  The staff there was very friendly, I must say.  I went an hour before closing and there weren't a lot of people.  Finally, I would say that if you are in the mood for some decent Filipino food, check this place out.  You may satisfy your tummy, but you probably won't be wowed.  However, one thing to keep in mind is that Thelma's is still better than some other Filipino restaurants in town which have their food drowned and soaked in oil."}
{"text":"One of the few Filipino restaurants that I trust to dine in and cater from! Catered lechon kawali multiple times and never been disappointed.    Lechon kawali: Basically, deep fried pork belly chopped and served with yummy brown sauce.   *Thelma's special: lechon kawali with tomatoes, onions, and soy sauce is a must try too!  Honorable mentions are: dinuguan (chocolate meat), pork guisantes, sinigang, and tapsilog.  This is one of those Filipino places where I would feel comfortable bringing my picky mom. They are always so friendly and have a true hospitable spirit. Most recently, they were very willing to complete a last minute catering order for my NYE party.  *****Yelp 2016 100 review challenge***** 1/100"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick stop of Filipino foods. Not too much to complain of. It tastes just like the location they have in Waipahu, HI. Got the sare sare and 4 choice mixed plate of pancit, gisante, and 2x Thelma special. All the flavors were there. Don't forget to check in and use the 10% discount!"}
{"text":"A nice quiet restaurant off The Strip!! I don't normally eat Filipino food, but this place is def a favorite when in Vegas for the weekend. I always get the Adobo Chicken Fried Rice and it ALWAYS hits the spot. Plenty of shredded chicken inside with a blanket of scrambled eggs on top!! Deliciously delicious:]] Affordable too, $8.50 for a huge portion. Also tried the regular Adobo Chicken and it was probably the best i've ever tasted. Use the Yelp Check-in for 10% off. I always try to find time in my weekend to make a stop here.. Craving it now as im writing this review actually ha!!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! This place is awesome!!! While traveling from Hawaii I found Thelma's Filipino Food and boy is it delicious! I hate to say it but it beats some of the restaurants back home in Hawaii. Craving homestyle food Thelma's is the place. Great service, easy parking and of course delicious Filipino food to die for!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff in a very casual setting.  The meals are excellent and as good as their location in Hawai'i (Waipahu) but in a much larger dining room.  They offer a wide variety of dishes.  Their dinaguan (dinardaan for the Ilokano but a more liquid version) is excellent.  I was surprised that for their chicken paria, the leaves were available as well as the fruit.  The sari-sari is excellent.  The pinakbet is good especially if you like bitter melon as the dish can be a little on the tart side.  The adobo, chicken and park, are always tasty.  My personal favorite which is the pork and pumpkin, is a home run.   As always, their adobo friend rice omelet is outstanding, as is their roast pork with tomato and patis.  There are many other selections available."}
{"text":"This restaurant is clean, lots of parking, walking distance to a casino n servers are friendly.  U place ur order at the walkup counter before sitting.  Drinks r self serve.  I thought the food was just okay!!"}
{"text":"Thelma's Filipino Restaurant Las Vegas is the second location for this Hawaii Favorite.  If you're craving Filipino it will take the edge off, but the original in Waipahu is better.   We tried the Shrimp Sarciago which was pretty wet, and lacked garlicky goodness; the Sari Sari which was good, though I wished there was more broth; and the Fried Pork which was the best dish, fatty and juicy.  Walk up to the counter to order and pay, then find a table, they will bring the food to you.  Not the best Filipino food I ever had, but the best you'll find in Las Vegas that's not homemade.  So go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I came in not knowing what to expect because I'm all about home made Filipino food. If it doesn't taste like your Nana's or Lola's cooking then these restaurants ain't doing it right... lol anyways, first impression was that the area is spacious, there are a lot of tables to accommodate rushes. You ended the door and start standing in line to the right side of the store where there are menus posted up close. Once you know what you want you'll see an order here sign to the left where you just order and pay then sit at a table of your choice. From there they will deliver the food out to you. They offer water cups and their water is mixed with lemons, which makes it even better.   I waited for 10 minutes before my food came out. The following prices were roughly: Thelma's Special (Pork Kawali with2 scoop Rice) $11 Mini Adobo Fried Rice $6 3 Choice Plate $11  First impression was the portioning is okay, it's on the small average side but it got my fiancè and I full. On top of their trash bins there are a variety of sauces such as soy sauce, vinegar, tobasco, etc. The cashier/ server lady was nice too. She checked up on us even when we sat at a table that was super far. The only thing I didn't like was the cleanliness. The chairs still had crumbs from previous customers and the table was sticky."}
{"text":"So we had ordered four halo halo specials. You know what we got? We received six ingredients- ice, two of the tiniest scoops of ube ice cream, condensed milk, some red jello, kaong, and macapuno.   No mungo, corn, leche flan, and other usual things. This is the special. I wonder if their usual halo halo only would have ice and milk.  Seriously, don't be so cheap. People, do not go and support a restaurant where it took them 15 mins to make this dessert. This is a total ripoff. Never again."}
{"text":"I like their Dinuguan , Lechon Kawali and pinakbet. Flavor was really good. They have to do something with their portions... seems like too little.  Order Halo-Halo, I think that was a rip off . There was hardly anything in it and they charge $5.  Service though was excellent!"}
{"text":"Nice Filipino/Hawaiian joint in Henderson. Staff is always so pleasant. Place is a good size, clean and offer TFC. Yay! They have lunch specials during the week. I ordered the two entree mixed plate and I chose to get the Thelma's special and the squid guisado. So yummy! Thelma's special is lechon kasal with tomatoes and onion with soy sauce. It was delicious and crispy! Their food was very tasty and fresh. Home cookin' for damn sure. If you're in Henderson, you definitely need to stop by Thelma's."}
{"text":"We ordered the adobo lunch combo and pancit mix for 15. 10% off with yelp check-in :)  - hard to find. I drove around in circles for a while then finally called. next to a vitamin shop. prius gps fail.  - spacious and nice decor. clean bathroom! TFC.  - great service! served to us without the tip. - adobo was good. came with 2 pieces. tender. right amount of vinegar and soy sauce for a great taste. wish they gave more sauce to put on top of rice. side of fruit.  - pancit was average. not dry, which is good. not sure if i would pay 8 bucks again for it. i'd just go for a pad-thai. - close but no cigar. eating filipino food in west covina and artesia/cerritos, i'd say that this place almost matches up with them. a bit more expensive. Although this is a great choice when it comes Henderson. Loves the fresh food."}
{"text":"I'm Filipino and ordered bangus, dinuguan, and pinakbet. The staff was friendly and the place was clean, but the food didn't have flavor.  The price was also higher than I'm used to for Filipino food. I wanted to support them since they didn't look like a chain restaurant, but I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"The following items are a must try:  Thelma's special Thelma's special and Thelma's special. oh and Everything that has pork in it. Which is more than 1/2 of the menu. The food is pretty quick. The chicken papaya soup is one of my favorites. It can't beat grandmas of course but it's hard to find a Papaya soup in Vegas.  They have a TV that plays Filipino shows. I don't know what they are saying but there Funny.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Thelma's fare is solid, but there was nothing that stood out as great.  The prices were great; dinner for 2 for less than $20.  We both had mix plates, and between the 2 of us we tried the Thelma's special, which is crispy fried pork pieces with onions & tomatoes.  The pork adobo, shoyu chicken, and the squid guisado.  Out of everything the shoyu chicken was the most tasty.  The rest of the dishes tasted like they were missing something, like they needed a little more something seasoning or something.  We added a little extra vinegar to the pork adobo and the flavor improved.  The staff was very nice and the facility was very clean.  They are kinda hidden, on the back corner of the strip plaza."}
{"text":"It's a hawaiian filipino restaurant. The taste of the dishes is not the best except for the the Thelma's special. Prices are ok and the service was fast with friendly workers. Will come back here only for the Thelma's special..."}
{"text":"Dont get me wrong i love filipino food but this place is good but they cut corners using canned tomatoes in their recipes. I've eaten at the original thelma's in waipahu and they didnt use canned tomatoes.  Other then that its pretty close to home."}
{"text":"Nice friendly staff! He's always so nice whenever I go in there. Today, I had the longanisa and garlic rice. I finished with Coco-nana for dessert :) Good food! Yummy."}
{"text":"We made it a tradition to come here every time we visit Vegas from California. The food is surprisingly good versus other Filipino restaurants we tried and both Nevada and California. This place is a hidden gym the food is made fresh to order. So give it a try and don't be shy"}
{"text":"Best Sinigang.  I am not filipino but I love everything they serve here at Thelma's.  I get Halo Halo for dessert love it every time.  The papaitan is good too I think it's not too bitter.  I think everyone should try.  You get in the restaurant order your food and pay at the counter.  They will serve you if you dine there.  Or you can call it advance for take out.  I ordered oxtail soup to do once in a while in a cold day.   Come try them... Inexpensive and convenient."}
{"text":"I came here with friends due to the glowing yelp reviews. Service was excellent. Of the dishes I sampled, their Kare-Kare was the shining star with real peanutty flavor and lovely oxtail and veggies. This Sinigang Stew with Shrimp  (a sour soup made with a tamarind base) was pretty good and arrived with ample shrimp. I personally wish it was twice as sour but it satisfied.  Less impressive were several dishes:  The Lumpiang Shanghai, a deep-fried meat-filled spring roll with a sweet and sour dipping sauce, lacked flavor and texture.  The Pancit Palabok craved seasoning and any anato seed flavor. The rice noodles were unexpectedly thin like a vermicelli but the lack of flavor was the main issue.  The Halo-Halo (mix-mix) Special as dessert was just pure disappointment.  In their menu, the regular Halo-Halo description included several components while the Special seemed to include the regular ingredients plus Ube (purple sweet root crop) ice cream. The special arrived in an okay-looking presentation of crushed ice with condensed or evaporated milk, red nata de coco (coconut gel), something else that was red and seemingly coconut-based, as well as Ube ice cream. It was missing red beans, garbanzos, macapuno (shredded, sweetened coconut) and pinipig (crunchy, crushed young rice). Any addition of even just one of those ingredients would make it truer to its name."}
{"text":"Yes, we could have walked over from our Sunset Station Hotel room. But we drove.   Location: On the grounds of the Sunset Station Hotel and Casino. A sort of mini mall area consisting of this and several other businesses. On the Sunset Rd side of the large property. Just across from the big shopping mall.  Venue: Large pleasant shop with lots of tables and a counter for ordering. Nothing too fancy.  Food: My wife wasn't feeling well and was craving some soup. Meaning some sort of Asian or Filipino soup. However once we got to the counter and looked at the menu, she wanted grilled fish and a couple of other dishes including pork guisantes and pancit. In fact, she got sort of excited at all of the choices and changed her order several times while forgetting all about the soup. I was looking for a meat free dish and spotted Mongo/Mung Beans with an option of malungay leaves. My wife explained to them that I was looking for vegetarian food. So they made it without fish sauce. It turned out to be good. To me it was thoughtful that they tried to make something special for me. I did try the pork guisantes and pancit and the peas, vegetables and sauce was as good as it gets. The pancit was good too but not as good as my wife's. She said it was very good for a restaurant version.  I was asked, by the owner, if I liked the mung beans and I did. She said that without the fish sauce it would have no flavor. However I had added a half vinegar and half soy sauce mixture to carefully enhance the taste to my liking. It was originally a bit bland without the usual salty fish paste.   Everyone was Friendly:  My wife is pretty outgoing. Before long she had the owner and several other customers talking about their food and sharing their life stories and having generally having a nice conversation. A fun time was had by all !   We enjoyed it so much that we didn't take any pictures. Most importantly the quality of the food was excellent and authentic. We were both happy that we stopped in at Thelma's."}
{"text":"I read the Yelp reviews about this place and wanted to try it right away but because of my work schedule, I never found the time. I've even mentioned this restaurant to my boyfriend and he said he's been here a few times with his cousins and he highly recommended it.  Well, I finally got to try the food here and I liked it a lot. I'm not too familiar with Filipino food so I ordered what I would usually order at other Filipino restaurants. I got the mix plate with chicken adobo, pancit mix, and Thelma's Special (lechon w/diced tomatoes and diced onions). I thought everything tasted great and I got full. The chicken adobo was so tender and the sauce made it even better. It was my first time trying lechon  and I thought it was good but I didn't like that it was covered in a lot of onions. I ended up picking out the onions.   The restaurant was very clean and the staff was very nice! I will definitely return and next time around, I'll try something different."}
{"text":"This place is not worth a comeback. Too much fat on the roast pork and that was the main reason we made the drive to try this place for the first time. We even ordered several dishes to go and that too wasn't all what I expected. I should've cooked it all myself..."}
{"text":"Food portions are small. I ordered 4 entrees and was only given. 1 bowl of rice and charged for additional."}
{"text":"HALO-HALO CHALLENGE 2013 - Contender #5  What started on a whim last week has resulted in the 5th day in a row of halo-halo for Mel C. and I.  Tonight we brought the challenge to the other side of town and invited a couple of Henderson Yelpers and the Asian Persuasion family to join us.  Shirley B is the duchess of Thelma's, a spacious restaurant near Sunset Station.  First tip:  use your Yelp app to check-in and get 10% off your order.  Ian A. checked in after he ordered and paid and missed out on the discount--sayang!  Next time, na lang.    There are two halo-halo versions here:  the plain one for $5.25 and the special one for $5.75, which includes macapuno and ube ice cream.  We had the special version and the ingredients were: pinipig (first time in 5 tries.  These are toasted rice grains--think Rice Krispies) macapuno (coconut strips) ube ice cream kaong (sugar palm fruit) nata de coco (coconut jelly) langka (jackfruit) cherries **See, we are learning the real names of the ingredients as we go along, instead of saying \"those red stringy things,\" and \" these green balls (!).\"  Yes, Mel and I are both the kind of Filipinos whose parents didn't really teach us Tagalog growing up stateside so we've had to learn as we go.  BUT, I can understand a lot, especially when you're not saying nice things  ;)  What was missing: ube leche flan red beans (azuki)  Everyone's halo-halo preferences are different, so we're just doing the leg work for you and letting you know what we find along the way.  I am still on the hunt for the halo-halo that has ube, leche flan, red beans, langka, kaong, nata de coco, macapuno, and ice cream in ONE bowl.  The search continues.

{"text":"1205 W Sunset Rd #180, Henderson, NV 89014 May 29, 2011 Sunday - lunch 2:00 PM 2 adults, teenager & kid  Atmosphere - 5 stars Food - 5 stars Service - 5 stars  Background - This is my first visit to a Filipino restaurant.  The restaurant's food has a influences with other Asian cultures; this is probably very common amongst them to share certain food items.  Atmosphere - A Strip mall restaurant hiding on the back without a direct view from the street.  The small sign in front allowed me to find the place.    Food Appetizer - Did not order any.  Main Course - I ordered the Lechon Kawali, I ordered this based on the picture at the front near the register.  The crunch was amazing.  I can not even describe the sauce but it was amazing.  The plate came with raw onion slices.  The three together were wonderful.  Afterwards I had to look up exactly what Lechon Kawali was, and found out it was the belly of the pig, which explained the crunch so well.  I also order Spam Wasubi, which I have had at a Hawaiian restaurant.  It was a daily special and not on the menu.  I could have order three of these and been very happy just eating that for lunch.   Dessert - Did not order any.  Service - It was fast food as you went to the counter, but they delivered the food to your table without asking for names or giving you table tent number.  The lady working was great, I had a hard time saying Kawali, and she made sure I learned it with ease.  I find that some of the fun going to a ethnic restaurant trying to learn their language. Somehow she knew another plate we wanted to order by just reading our facial expressions, amazing.  They have a pop machine that was self service.  While we waited for our food extra plates were brought to us so we all could share each other's foods, similar to a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the service and hospitality was great. But the food was much less than I would expect from a restaurant with this current 4 star ranking. Kare Kare had too much peanut butter. . Way more than I ever tasted in this dish.  Also the tripe and oxtail wasn't boiled enough and was very tough to chew.  and the Thelma's Special was not as appealing as the pictures and a little on the dry side.  We also had some fresh vegetable lumpia which were pretty good."}
{"text":"How did this place get 200+ reviews when it's EMPTY! This alone should have been a sign and I should have walked out! So anyways I get the palabok, pusit na adobo, the thelma special, and pancit. The palabok tasted so weird..almost like sardines? Idk but I took a couple of bites and threw it away. The Thelma special was filled with fat and burned lechon. The pusit had no flavor. Lastly, what's up with the serving of rice? It's such small baby scoops of rice! My 2 year old can eat all the rice in 2 bites! Basically won't be back and won't be recommending this place to anyone. Sad because I was looking for a place to cater for our party..."}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service! They seemed pretty backed up... reasonable. But my family waited 40+ minutes for us all to get our food. What made it worst was that people who came in after us began to get their food while we still waited. Not only until someone in our party said something did the rest of our parties food come out. They really need to work on the service."}
{"text":"This is the only Filipino restaurant I would go to. The food is always delicious, friendly staff, and it's very clean! I love, love, the Thelma's Special and their Coco Nana dessert. My daughter requests for the dessert  and pancit all the time!"}
{"text":"Wanted to love them but the slow service and no AC when it's hot just doesn't cut it. Do not go on a Sunday when they are busy. There was a full restaurant and only about 3 people working. We waited almost 1 hour for our food. Not to mention they mixed up other tables food. Meaning they sat the wrong persons food on our table and left. We had to flag them down and tell them it wasn't our food. Then they brought it to the other table, who refused it because it had been sat down in front of us. Food was solid but the waiting with our daughters in the heat with a lousy ceiling fan just doesn't cut it. Tried to tell the owners husband that we liked the food, but that it was too hot, he brushed us off and said it was his wife's restaurant. Yeah and you are in here working, so you should give a flip, right?! That blew us outta of the water, and unfortunately we will find some other good Filipino food."}
{"text":"Best Filipino restaurant in Las Vegas!  I always get their mixed plate. Delicious pork adobo, Thelma's special, and mongo beans.   This is the only place where the Filipino food is made like my family's recipe. The staff is very friendly and always smiling. I would absolutely suggest to everyone to try this place out!"}
{"text":"Gustung-gusto ko ng masarap na pagkain.  I am honestly somewhere in between a 3 star rating and a 5 star rating for this place, so that is why the four. Not perfect but pretty damn good.  We came with an appetite and ordered a crap load of food. We ordered so much food, they moved us from a small table to a big table. Yeah, it was just me and my hunny and my son.  The following is what we devoured:  Spam Masubi Longanisa Masubi Lechon Kawali Marinated Bangus A mixed plate with: rice and macaroni salad, shoyu chicken, pancit mix, and squid guisado. Another mixed plate with: rice, squid guisado, pinkabet and dinuguan.  I fell absolutely in love with their lechon. Some of the best in this valley that I have tried to be honest. Their mang sauce is definitely not watered down like other restaurants do. (My mouth is watering just thinking about the lechon now). It was fried perfectly with a perfect ratio of skin, to fat, to meat. And most importantly, it didn't leave a greasy feeling in my mouth.  The bangus was on point and was boneless. An extra plus for my hunny.   The squid guisado was delicious as well. Not overpowered by the bagoong.  I find that a lot of places fill their pinakbet with squash and this was a good balance of all veggies.   Both of the masubi's were delicious and the fact that I could order a longanisa masubi made me very excited.    Honestly, it was all good. Except the dinuguan left me very disappointed. I was not a fan of the taste or texture of this one.  We spend a little under $40 for all the food and had plenty to take home.   Just know that if you order hot tea, it is simply a lipton tea bag and they give the hot water and lemon and honey.   And if you like they play TFC on the TV.  Gawin ang iyong sarili ng ilang mabuti at kumain sa Pilipino restaurant na ito nang hindi bababa sa isang beses."}
{"text":"$5.75 Halo Halo (special) is only special because of Macapuno that is the only star of the show and maybe 2 tbs of ube ice cream. Other than that, you get all ice and milk and all of the halo halo ingredients on top for presentation. You're better off spending the same amount at seafood city. At first we thought it was a mistake, when we asked the waitress to clarify, she agreed and walked away. Ha."}
{"text":"(WARNING: Filipino food can have a strong mixture of sour, vinegary, salty goodness banging up against sweet, crunchy, meaty climaxes of flavor.  If these types of taste are too sexy for your tongue, you may want to eat elsewhere.  Consider yourselves warned.  I'd better not see anyone putting up some negative reviews because they were not prepared.)  Even though I may not look it, I'm half Filipino and grew up with this food.  That being said, I will most likely show a lot of favoritism towards this place.  Its flavors take me back to my childhood and playing with my cousins.  Thelma's is located near the Sunset hotel in the same building as Aloha kitchen.  (Aloha kitchen is known for having the worst teri chicken I have ever had, but great kalbi)  To Find Thema's you need to drive around to the back side of that building.    The inside is simple with a theme leaning towards the tropical and the Filipino channel on the TV set.  The menu may not be the largest, but what they make I love.  Today I went with one of my favorites and something new.  I had the combo with my fav, dinuguan (aka dinardaraan for my Ilocano bothers), and Thelma's special.    Dinuguan is a vinegary tasting pork blood meat.  Being cooked with blood, it comes out looking like stew size chunks of pork in black sauce.   It is rich with flavor and has a lovely grit to it from the blood.  Thema's take on it was true to mom's cooking back home.  However, the sauce was a bit thinner than I like and they seem to have taken out all the fatty bits for the general public's sake.  My mom didn't discriminate, fatty or lean, it went in the pot.  Over all, it was great.  Not as good as moms, but pretty close.  Now Thelma's special is a bit miss leading.  The description says it's lichon kawali cut up and mixed with chopped onions, tomatoes, and soy sauce.  A more accurate description would have been chicharon with chopped onions, tomatoes, and bagoong.  Cause that's what it tasted like and it tasted wonderful.  It made me wish that I got more of it.  For those of you that don't know, lichon Kawali is a whole roasted pig, all crispy and wonderful on the outside.  This dish was salty, oniony, sweet, meaty, and crunchy.  Heavenly.  My mom made the same thing for me when I was younger and this was just as good.  Sorry mom, I must be honest.  The one thing that was a bit difficult was the server that day.  We were having some communication problems, but my order came out right and it came out extremely quick.  That's what matters.  So if you're in the area, bypass Aloha Kitchen and head on over to Thelma's for some good eats.  Did I mention the price was good too?  Because it is!"}
{"text":"Came here last week when I was in Henderson for business.  Had the combo with pancit, pork adobo and dinuguan.  I also got some lumpia and lechon.  Everything was delicious.  I don't have Filipino food often so it's kind of a comfort food when I can get it type of thing.  I'm kind of a germophobe so I hate looking into the kitchen in restaurants.  Now that I'm home, I'm craving it again.  I'll be back next week."}
{"text":"Frequency: Regular  Order: Pork Gisante w/ Rice, Crispy Lechon w/ Rice and Adobo w/ Rice.  Overall: Close proximity to where I live, across from Sunset Station Hotel, clean, decent prices for authentic homemade Filipino food and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite filipino food is Sarciado. Ordered from here and I instantly fell in love with the place. Hubby got the adobo, ofcourse good also. Clean and friendly environment..   The only reason I gave 4/5 because it is a bit pricey for a small serving."}
{"text":"My family's go to for Filipino food. I always order the sweet longonesa and fried silet. They serve rice with all dishes but of course. The ladies who work here are nice. It does take a minute to get your food which is fine because it is sooo worth it. This place serves up local authentic filipino food so if you're ever in the mood head over here. Me and my family always battle the traffic and length from summerlin to come and get our Filipino fix when my dad doesn't want to cook."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Every once in a while, I have a crazy craving for bangus.  Since I was in Henderson, I was so glad to find this Filipino restaurant in the area.  Of course I ordered the Bangus breakfast plate, with garlic fried rice and 2 eggs over easy.  I ordered mini spam fried rice for the kids and a pork BBQ on a stick for each of them. Thelma's is an actual restaurant, not  \"turo turo\" style, so the food is cooked to order.   So, the kids and I grabbed a table, sat down, and waited patiently for our food while we watched Filipino soap operas.  And we waited.  And waited. And waited some more.  Sadly, there was only 1 party ahead of us. After 38 minutes, the food finally came, but by then I was losing my mind- because I had 2 very hungry and now cranky kids.    At least the food was good comfort food.  And the mini fried rice was a huge order- so much that even after the kids devoured it- we still had leftovers to take home.  And the bangus with binegar hit the spot.   The restaurant is huge, plenty of seating.  The service was friendly. The prices are higher than the \"turo turo\" places. I just wish I had brought a snickers bar in my purse to alleviate those \"hangry pains\" (hungry + angry) that crept up while we were waiting.   *Yelp 100 Challenge: Review 52/100*"}
{"text":"First time here! Super Slow/Poor service  the place was not even busy still took them 23mins to prepare our food!!! People ordered after us got their food first! Cashier came up to us and asked us what we order like are you kidding meI don't think I'll come back here."}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii I know what good food is and this place hit the spot!!!! The food may take a little longer than you'd like, but that's only because they make it fresh! I love love love everything i ate here and my family did as well! I'll definitely be coming back.   Also, if you're from Hawaii, this place is owned and ran by their daughter so YES, the food tastes exactly the same as the restaurant in Hawaii.   Filipino food just like it should be and I highly recommend their sari sari, grilled pork, Thelma special, adobo fried rice, shrimp sarciado, halo halo special...who am I kidding??!! I recommend the whole menu!!!!"}
