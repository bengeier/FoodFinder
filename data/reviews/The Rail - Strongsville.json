{"text":"Very busy ,benches in waiting area were very uncomfortable as I have a pinched nerve , burger was tasty but 2.25 for the blah fries ,,and the onion rings my husband ordered were very greasy  bill was over $110.00 for 4 adults and 1 child ,,Soda for 3 ,a water and my son 2 beers as it was his birthday treat ,  my husband and I will not be returning at that price. for a burger that I could have made at home and my fries are so much better ,,,they did bring a brownie with ice-cream that was tasty .....that is why I gave them 2 stars"}
{"text":"The food is ok. Beer is good. They really need to come to Jesus and stop under estimating the wait time. We've been to this location several times. It's always a 20-30 minute wait. I go check after 40 minutes and they tell me it's going to be another 30 minutes. Always."}
{"text":"I'm kind of surprised by all the negative reviews of this place it was my first time here and the lady told us it was a 30 minute wait so we decided to wait but it didn't even take that long (10 minutes max). Anyway our waitress was very attentive I had the Rail Burger my mother had the Mojo burger both were absolutely delicious as were the fries I really have no complaints all I know is I had a great experience here and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.   Wednesday night. My friend and I popped in for a burger with a gluten-free bun \"to go\". The young host was a very nice guy and took our order right away. I came to check on the food (right as it was coming out from behind the bar) and was informed by the host that they were out of gluten-free buns. (Keep in mind, the food was already done and coming out from the bar). He told me they could \"put a regular bun on the side if I'd like that\". I wouldn't like that. I can't eat a regular bun so what good does that do me? I expressed disappointment and asked if they would remove any cost from the meal (let's be honest, a burger without a bun is a pretty sad excuse for a \"meal\"). He said he couldn't. Up until now, my experience has merely been with this young kid that probably doesn't know too much about how to handle a situation like this. So I don't want to fault the him too much.  But here is the part I am most frustrated with.   The bartender who delivered the food to me said that they have been \"out of gluten-free buns since Sunday\" (keep in mind, its Wednesday). I quickly asked why I wasn't informed of that when I ordered  and she shot back \"normally our waiters will say that, but because he is just a host he didn't see the sign on the back wall\". Okay. So because you guys didn't adequately tell your host what to say (or you just messed up), I have to pay for it? So again I ask if I can have a discount or something. Nothing. It was just a \"what's the big deal, it's just a bun\" attitude. And I wish I could say it was just those two involved. But by this time, another waiter/host had come over and been listening to this entire exchange.   This is the epitome of poor customer service. Rule #1: ALWAYS try to fix an issue before it becomes one. A simple \"what can we do to help this situation?\" would have gone miles. I ended up leaving the restaurant only to decide (once I got to my car) that I wouldn't stand for this. $12 for a sad patty in a box? I don't think so. So I went back in.   I asked for a refund. The young host went to get a manager. It didn't seem like he found one so he grabbed another bartender, who was nice, but wasn't able to make a refund. So then the host went to find the manager again and did. She came over and was able to refund me the money. (Side note: she was very nice, helpful, and understanding).   Moral of the story: had ANYONE offered to help fix the situation (i.e. taking off the cost of the sweet potato fries I ordered (~$3), giving me a discount on something else, giving me the option to reorder, immediately going to find the manager when it first happened) then I would have left feeling like it was just a mistake the young kid made and not think much of it (heck, I've been in his shoes before). But the fact that so many people were involved (before the manager) and NONE of them had the common customer service knowledge to try to alleviate the situation, it reflects very poorly on the restaurant. And because of that, I got a refund on my entire burger. This restaurant could have saved money in the long run there.   Customer first...especially when it's your problem."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been here once before, and got the Mainstreet Fries. He loved them so much, we had to come back! The second time I got the Nutella Crunch shake, per recommendation of our server, Ian. My boyfriend and I could not stop raving about how wonderful the food and service is. It's our new favorite place!! Would highly recommend to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Good food and a good atmosphere. Really nothing quite worth raving about but they're are a few things that I would recommend if you ever decide to go. For you ginger lovers like myself the ginger soda was to die for (in my opinion). Secondly was the truffle fries. Nothing in the area quite like them. Overall I wouldn't say the place is absolutely to die for but if you want a dinner with your buddies for a decent price this is a great hangout spot."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed. This was my second time here. We came on a cold day and the restaurant itself was cold. We put our coats on to warm up.The person I was with ordered a burger with mozzarella cheese and the cheese was cold and not melted. The burger was not juicy. I ordered the chicken salad sliders. They were good, but the bun is too heavy and overpowers the chicken salad. We got the rosemary fries which were delicious. The waiter was ok. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The burgers are nice but I prefer B-spot. The rail does have better alcohol if that's your preference. The burgers here are more gourmet than classic in my opinion."}
{"text":"I ate here a few days ago, and I was not impressed at all. As someone who thinks that B Spot (the Rail's main competitor) is way overrated, I had really hoped that the Rail would be good, but it just didn't live up to my expectations at all. I got the Local Yokel burger with tator tots, and both were mediocre. The burger had a sunny side up egg on it, which I typically love on my burgers, but it was not fried long enough, causing the yolk to explode out of the burger on my first bite and drip down my sweatshirt sleeve all the way up to my elbow. It took a good 10 minutes in the bathroom to clean that up, and I was less than thrilled. The burger patty itself was terrible. It was thin, small, flavorless, and was well done despite the fact I ordered it medium well. The tator tots were practically the size of baseballs, but tasted terrible!!! They tasted absolutely nothing like potatoes, and were filled with this flavorless, goey, cheese-type substance that made them taste horrible. On top of all that, the waitress was very inattentive, and didn't even bring out napkins or silverware, and barely checked back at the table at all. Overall, it wasn't good at all, and it's a shame, because it would be a great concept if they improved the food quality."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty burgers,  not exceptional.   Shoe string fries were a dissapointment, for a burger place I'd expect the fries to be out of this world"}
{"text":"Me and my wife we went there last night and for about 20 minutes sitting and in our  table no one came tour table to teak our orders  greeted us know when i even or even say hello. And the funny part is when we walked out me and my wife the host actually asked us what is wrong   I told him that no one greeted us we been sitting here for 20 minutes and we're leaving and, he said oh OK well thanks for let me know bye-bye while he is sitting drink his soda or water. We will never go back and I will let all my friends in the area not to.( by the way the place want even busy it was around 4:00 pm Monday.)"}
{"text":"Burgers were good, but if your known for burgers they really should be great. Nice atmosphere and good service. Fried pickles were good onion rings were a little bland."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I sat at the bar and got the rail burger and sweet potato fries.  Probably the best burger I have had in a while. You can really tell the food is very fresh! For the food I give it 5 stars, but I can only give 3 stars for the service, because I had to flag down the bartender to get a drink when I was the only one at the bar. Overall still much better than nearby chain restaurants. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Very yummy, great atmosphere and great service. Mac and cheese bites were the best and the vanilla nitro coffee was on point. Only small complaint is my medium well burger was definitely well done. Still great burgers, tho."}
{"text":"What a difference a day makes.   Yesterday's complaints of wait times, unused tables, and poor food left the building at sun rise.   I came in here twice on a Thursday night. Around 6:45 for a drink, left for a meeting, came back at 9:00 for a burger.   Early visit, place was packed, lots of people waiting for a table, but saw nothing open. Found a seat at the bar (only seat open in the joint). Megan was on me like stink on shit and had one of their 24 Ohio crafted beers on me in no time. Had a nice chat with the guy next to me, visiting from Baltimore, and commenting on what a nice town Strongsville is.   Went to a meeting and came back for the Local Yokel Burger (bacon, egg & Swiss). The burger was very good, but the bacon was outstanding. The fried egg was over hard. Would have preferred a runny yoke.   Also, ordered fries. The ones I got were cold. Meagan took them back and what seemed like an unusually long time, got a hot, fresh order in front of me. They were good and Meagan took them off the tab.   I, too, will compare this place to the neighboring B spot, but I'm going to give the Rail the nod. The design of the bar makes it feel much more open. Although I miss the B Spot's pickle bar, not having Rosemary in my fries is worth it.  The TVs make it very sportsbarish too. A good thing when watching the Tribe and the Browns at the same time.  And, not having to pay extra for only ice in my bourbon is priceless."}
{"text":"Get the 7th Heaven burger. Seriously... do it. Trust me on this. It's an amazzzzing burger with red onion jam and truffle butter. I suggest eating the burger directly over a side of skinny fries, because the truffle butter will drip from the burger onto the fries, and once the fries get soaked in truffle butter they are divine!! This place has the best fried pickles I've ever had as well. I took someone here who typically hates pickles, and even they were like \"dis some quality cuisine\". If you like a drink with your meal, I highly recommend their Long Island iced teas. If you want to top it all off with a dessert, definitely go with their milkshakes. I could rave about this place all day. I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants, but this place is definitely an exception. Five stars all around!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed to say I came 15 minutes before closing and they wouldn't take a to-go order. That's a first.  Just giving a random 3 star rating because it made me in order to comment. I guess I'll never truly know what to rate this place though."}
{"text":"The Rail has pretty good burgers but I come here for the sweet potato fries. Today I also ordered a side of Brussels sprouts because the menu sold it so well-- sadly it did not live up to the expectation."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Overpriced, over cooked bland burgers. Everything is extra (fries, onion rings)."}
{"text":"Smack yo mamma in the mouth good!!!!! I'm so glad and fatter now that there is a Rail in Strongsville! On a Friday night, just before 6pm we waited only 15-20 minutes! The service and food was wonderful.(as always) I'm glad the rail delivered because my family and I were entertaining a colleague of mine from Portsmouth, Ohio and boy was he impressed!     If you need to know more about the best burger joint in town, dare I say the state? Then just check my reviews of one of their older locations. They've got a great brand and they're keeping it great! We may need to think about a sixth star!"}
{"text":"The Rail does a lot of things right. The food is fresh, well-priced, and tasty. The restaurant itself is very nice, with a bar separating the booths and tables from the patio area; this makes access to drinks very convenient. I will say, though, that the service really hits it out of the park!   Happy hour is great and on top of that they also have a specially priced drink all day for particular days of the week. For instance, Long Island Iced Teas are $3 all day on Fridays.   Honestly, the only thing I would change is the a la carte sides...I think it's unAmerican to serve a burger without fries. Keep up the good work Rail, I love ya."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers!   We have eaten at The Rail in Fairlawn a couple of times and were glad to see a new location closer to where we stay when we visit relatives in Ohio. The Strongsville location is larger than Fairlawn, perhaps leading to a shorter wait time for a table (about 15 minutes during peak dinner rush on a weeknight).  The food was excellent and portions generous. We had an attentive and knowledgeable waiter, Seth.  This place is well worth the wait. Come hungry. You will not be disappointed.  Definitely on our list for our next visit to OH."}
{"text":"We started with the fried pickles from the happy hour menu which were very good. Too many times there is to much breaking on them and these were perfect.   I had the yokel local burger (burger with bacon and egg) and my wife had the bootlegger. We both enjoyed these perfectly cooked burgers.   The beer selection was VERY good (all Ohio beers)."}
{"text":"So I do not know how on earth you can be a burger joint and not have fresh-cut fries but they seem to do it. A lot of fried food including their veggie burger that you can buy at the grocery store yourself. Also I really like the fact that they use local meat but beware it is not healthier or cleaner meet it is just local. They still use anabiotic's and steroids and the whole thing..."}
{"text":"On my second visit here I dined alone a few Saturdays ago a little past 5:00 and the place was packed. I asked the hostess if I could sit at the bar and was able to find an end seat in front of a tv showing the Indians game. I was greeted by a friendly and knowledgeable bartender who helped me select a beer from their extensive menu of all Ohio brewed draught beers. After looking at the food menu I decided on the Rail burger with an order of onion rings.(Yes !!!! They had onion rings this time !) The burger was done to absolute perfection ! Slightly chargrilled on the outside, moist and flavorful on the inside and with my requested toppings it was delicious. The onion rings with the red pepper sauce were scrumptious. All this along with a locally brewed \"Big Woody\" Munich style lager....All was great ! A waitress behind the bar was making a chocolate milkshake and offered me some of the leftover and it was absolutely delicious ! It had chocolate wafers and Nutella blended in it and it was the best milkshake I have ever had. Excellent food and exceptional service (and the Indians won!) My second visit was very pleasing and certainly won't be my last !"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. A bit busy but that always a great sign of good food. The burgers were juicy and delightful . Excellent place to visit."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger place in town. The quality of meat is exceptional. We get the naked burger, as we have reduced carbs, so there is no hiding the flavor. We have gone weekly since before Xmas and every time it was cooked as ordered, MEDIUM! juicy, warm pink center! Service has been very good and friendly. Manager circulates. This months appetizer, spinach artichoke dip is also very good."}
{"text":"We were hesitant to try this place on Labor Day, but the food was great and delivered timely. The server (Nick) was excellent and able to make suggestions for the food and beer menu. Only giving 3 stars for a 45 minute wait when there were plenty of open tables. They really need to make adjustments in the kitchen to fix this problem."}
{"text":"Fiance and I decided to try this for date night..he loves burgers... our food was great...the fries are ridiculous. Steak n shake has bigger fries...then we both got horrendously sick to our stomachs within 30 minutes of eating there...will not be returning"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I love stopping at The Rail when we are out shopping on Saturday's at South Park Mall. Let me say that the Lamb Burger that I had was outstanding and their beer selection is on the mark. Fried Pickles ARE A MUST. Get them and you won't be sorry! They just recently expanded to Dublin down where I live, so I am excited to see how they are in expansion mode.  Do's:  DO order the Meat Hook Pilsner for a tasty light beer DO order the Fried Pickles DO go with a burger, medium rare"}
{"text":"So glad this place is taking off and growing.  Driving from Hudson to the new Rails is getting old but we are tired of bspot and flipside......"}
{"text":"First visit to the new Strongsville location did not disappoint. Food was excellent! I customized the Rail Burger and they got it right. I ordered my burger very well done and it was cooked perfectly! Our waitress was very nice, brought extra napkins without us having to ask. She was a little MIA toward the latter part of our visit though, and did not ask if we wanted refills on our drinks. The staff at the host/hostess stand seemed a little immature. When we left, another worker was clearly hanging out and wasting time up there.  Overall we were happy and will be back."}
{"text":"Burger place (comparable to B-spot) with an emphasis on local beer (what a concept, not) - needless to say I was skeptical about trying it and had expectations going in - but this place was a nice surprise! Friendly waitstaff, great craft beer selection and they actually cooked my burger medium - and it was great. Didn't hurt that our waiter was hot.  One star off - nothing too special going on here but everything was executed well.  FYI - burgers are ala cart, they have a good happy hour so try to hit that up, \"rail sauce\" is just BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place. Great service, great lamb burger with crispy show string fries, great beer selection with focus on Ohio. Outdoor seating available and bright, picnic bench seating. I'd go again for sure!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a long time! I have been searching since my favorite burger place closed and nothing has come remotely close until now. I had The Philippe and added tomato and feta and it was absolutely delicious! Even with all the toppings (avocado, red onion, spinach, cucumber) the true star was the beef, perfectly grilled with just the right amount of seasoning.  My fiancé had the 7th heaven and added mozzarella, and not the shredded or thinly sliced mozzarella either. I'm talking thick fresh mozzarella. I actually mistook it for a fried egg and declined at first, but luckily I changed my mind. There was no question about the truffle butter, and the bacon is the way God intended it to be. Both burgers came with shoestring fries and can be subbed out but in my opinion it was the perfect combination. We didn't have anything from the bar, but I loved the homage to local products - breweries & distilleries rejoice! Our server, Dee, was awesome too! She provided perfect service and helped us along the way without overwhelming us. We will definitely be back. We live on the east side and I'm already looking for excuses to be out this way soon! Fantastic job! Cheers!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick lunch. We waited about 20 mins, but it was worth it, the burgers were awesome! Our waitress was very nice. Only downside was you had to pay for the fries separately. But they were truffle fries so it was still worth it."}
{"text":"I've been here several times since this location opened and have also ordered take out. I have yet to be disappointed! Delicious juicy burgers every time! Fried pickles are good and I'm hooked on the Bootlegger burger as well as the Cajun sweet onion salad dressing! It's my go to place when I'm in the mood for a burger!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I am not a fan of hamburgers. But my husband is, so we gave this gave this place a try. I had the truffle burger and have to say this was one of the best meals I've ever had. I love that everything is local. Server was fun & enthusiastic. Great location & atmosphere. Will return often!"}
{"text":"Great service. Very different drink menu which I love! Good food! Except for the \"Skinny Fries\". They are garbage cardboard tasting fries. For real these are the worst fries on the planet. They are extremely hard! I don't think they understand how to cook the skinny fries."}
{"text":"Met our daughter for lunch.  The burgers were delicious.  I love their sweet potato fries.  A good burger joint.  Service was attentive but not overbearing.  They had Bloody Mary's as a special and they were really good.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Oue server Kerrianne... sorry I don't know how she spells her name but who she is/ personality made our experience even better! Food was good and drinks.were on point! I personally judge experience over food and again Kerri Anne made it South fun!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for our first visit last night, on a Tuesday evening. We walked in to find 3 employees standing at the host stand. The boy who has shoulder length hair pulled back by a head band & glasses stared at us and eventually snapped \"How many\" while shading his head & laughing. No \"hello\", \"welcome\", \"how can we help you\". I contemplated leaving due to his lack of customer service ability but my husband wanted to try this place so we stayed.  Our server was great. She really made up for the buffoon at the host stand. My husband's burger was one of the best he's ever had while the Caprese salad I started with was ok until I tried to cut into one of the tomato slices and find it was green in the middle. It was inedible. The pickle slices were delicious as an appetizer. The only other issue we encountered was a small plate that came out dirty. There was some sort of dressing all over the bottom of the plate.....pretty gross.  I'm sure we'll go back, as my husband likes his burgers! But some additional customer service training is needed for some to provide The Rail's guests one of a kind service, understanding The B Spot is across the street."}
{"text":"A lot of beers on tap! The rail burger with American cheese medium rare with lettuce tomato and sautéed mushroom= the most tastiest juiciest burger ever!! Get the tater tots... very cheesy and good dipping sauce. The waitstaff was very nice, patient and offered great recommendations as well!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner. Order the mac n chesse bits for an app and they were fantastic. I had a bunless chicken sandwhich and frie t was incredible. But i order a long island, the first time it was straight coke. I let the bartender know and he said there had to be someone with their mix. He came back with another and it was straight sour mix. Clearly the bartenders cant mix a drink they have a special. The food was good but the drink quality was horrible."}
{"text":"First time trying this one. I like the set up. The service was decent, though a little slower. Our server was bright and friendly, but maybe had too many tables? Fortunately, they have runners for the food, as it came out quickly, but no one came to check on us for some time after. We didn't really need for anything, but you know how you expect someone wishing 5 minutes of taking your first bite? It was fine otherwise and she earned a full tip.  The pork nachos had little flavor other than SALT. They have so much potential with the cheese and jalapeños, but way too salty. It was missing some more fresh tomatoes or salsa or spices...anything except salt.   For dinner, I had the pulled pork sandwich and the boyfriend had a burger with pulled pork on top. I tried some of the burger meat from the boyfriend and that was delicious! Very flavorful and cooked perfectly. The restaurant boasts about using local beef and by the flavor, I don't doubt it. The pork, again, was way too salty. The barbecue sauce was good, but the abundance of salt in the meat made it difficult to finish. The boyfriend said that he could tell when he got a bit of pork in the bite, because it completely salted out the flavor of the burger.  The morning after: I feel like I've just crawled out of the Sahara and need at least a gallon of water today."}
{"text":"Good food, but can sometimes be a hit or miss depending on who's in the kitchen. Shakes are good and they have a good beer menu. Not the best place to carry on a conversation though, as it can be very loud due to the openness of the space and tall ceilings. Still, it's a great place to meet up for dinner and drinks with family and friends."}
{"text":"Great pulled pork and great Long Island Iced Tea. The wife had a Bootlegger Burger and it was great also. Nice sized portions too."}
{"text":"To say this is one of the worst meals I've had in awhile is an understatement the first three things I ordered were not available on the menu and I cannot say they were seasonal since one of them was a salad.  Service was prompt but very unattentive.  Food took nearly an hour to come out and was lukewarm at best.  Yes a medium-rare burger that is lukewarm is scary to eat but since our server never return I could not send it back.  The tater tots were some of the worst I've ever had undercooked.  The drinks I ordered were full of ice very little beverage.  By the other reviews I read I had great promise for this restaurant but over price and other delivered I will probably not be back.   D-."}
{"text":"We met some friends for lunch at noon. Staffing was terrible for weekend lunch; our server appeared to be the only one handling our side of the house, including the table of 10 little kids that was seated behind us after we arrived. The food was very underwhelming; it took 40 minutes to appear. Husband's cheesy tots were super-greasy (as if they weren't allowed to drain). The grilled zucchini planks were tasty, but the portion was maybe a quarter of a baby zucchini. The Southwest chicken naan was stingy in portion size (for $10.50, I'd expect more than 3 oz. of chicken and three strips of red pepper). Our server did an excellent job keeping our drinks refilled, and the restaurant was very clean and nicely decorated."}
{"text":"My first time at this location was great! The food was all cooked perfectly and my party enjoyed themselves. I wish The Rail near me had as much seating as this one! A great experience, as always."}
{"text":"Got the crouching burger with the homemade tater tots and it was fuego the staff is very friendly I will be going back more often cause the food was dank"}
{"text":"I've been to The Rail a few times now and can honestly say that I like going. It's not the burger, you've had better I'm sure, but I love the concept of the Ohio raised beef and supporting our local farmers.   In addition to burgers, The Rail offers any of their menu sandwiches as a Veggie Burger, Grilled Ohio Chicken Breast or Hand-Breaded Fried Ohio Chicken Breast at no cost. Flour tortilla and gluten free buns are also available at no charge.   Their menu is full of flavor varieties including seasonal specials, and even a decent Kid Menu with a nice selection for your little ones.   For beer enthusiasts, The Rail has over 20 pulls, including a feature Ohio brewery, and an even larger selection of cans and bottles. There is also their Beer Exploration Society, which features other breweries and their brews for $12 for beer and apps. You can check out their website for more info as dates and features vary between their four locations.   I love keeping it Ohio and The Rail is all about it!"}
{"text":"7th Heaven Burger missed the mark.  Meat was medium (like I ordered) but it was burnt. Thick cut bacon was too chewy and the truffle butter was non-existent. I opted for the homemade tater tots for an upcharge- not worth it. The only good thing about the meal was Crystin, who waited my table. She was very attentive, friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.   Sorry, Crystin, but I  probably won't be back!"}
{"text":"Great concept using OH breweries and  OH beef.  Our group consisted of 8 people and we all had different burgers and the veggy sandwich as well as 5 appetizers.  All items were tastee and we had more than enough to fill us all. You  have to try bonfire fries and fried pickles.  Semi outside seating area is the best atmosphere and very casual. Thanks again to Seth for the outstanding service. You can even grab a growler to go!!! Larger orders of the potato sides would be a plus to share with the table."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner a few weeks ago. It always seems to be crowded so we wanted to see what the hype was all about. We were seated in the dining area to the left of the bar when you walk in. There were some tvs around but they were harder to see. We were surprised to find out we were there for their trivia night (a Thursday) so we decided to play. We ended up coming in 2nd place and winning free beer and gift certificates but unfortunately the manager told us we couldn't use them on this visit (it didn't say we couldn't on the cards). This was pretty upsetting because the only reason we stayed and drank more was because of the trivia night. The food there was alright. We all orders build your own burgers. I did a veggie burger and the burger was a different veggie burger made with peas and other veggies (not black bean) but I liked it. I ordered sweet potato fries- my favorite! I liked the beer they had which was their brew. Overall it was just okay. I'll have to check it out again but wasn't as good as I expected."}
{"text":"Starting with the positive- the service was great! The food on the other hand was not! Burger was burnt- badly, they tried to cover it up with the cheese, but you can't cover that taste and crunch! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich- it was just over room temperature and had zero flavor.   Was not worth the long wait for a table and definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"I actually love ,service is excellent, food is very good,, burgers are pricey but very good for the money,  am I love thier truffle fries,  an for the first time tried toner fried pickles an they were very good...id come back again..!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time yesterday and it was great! The fried chicken sandwich wasn't dry at all and soooo good! Someone at the table ordered a burger and said it was also great!   During our meal a manager even stopped by to see how we were enjoying everything, great service!   Will definitely be back many times!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came in a couple days ago. Loved the decor. Can't wait to visit this place in the summer with the big TVs and bar and patio outside! Thought it was clean and well taken care of.   Food was fantastic. Had a couple appetizers and I had a juicy burger. Thought they had some good happy hour appetizers and prices.   Service was okay. She was nice and funny as the Browns were playing, but at times she disappeared and seemed to lack interest in our table. Wasn't 100% friendly, but she could have had been having a rough day.   Overall decor was great. Food was amazing. Will definitely try it again. Need to try the Fried Chicken Sandwich! Yum."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful visit here tonight! Stopped in and sat right down at the bar where there were always a few empty chairs. There was a wait for a table. They use the names of counties in Ohio to call guests when their tables are ready. The ingredients on the menu are almost all Ohio sourced including their beers, wines and liquors! It was a fun theme and very well done. The atmosphere was modern industrial. There were plenty of TVs and garage doors that opened with nicer weather to patio seating. The multiple servers behind the bar were all very welcoming and friendly and worked together as a team. We were well taken care of.  We had a beer and a pumpkin martini. Ordering before 6pm gets you a buck off. There were many taps and additional beers by the bottle.   We split a 7th heaven burger, all ingredients Ohio raised. It was cooked perfectly medium and came topped with a truffle butter, onion jam, bacon and cheese. It was delicious on a soft fresh bun. We had the grilled maple and bacon Brussels sprouts, so good with a small sprinkle of salt added, and the house made tator tots. I have never had tots like these before and they were awesome! They were the size of golf balls and had a cheese melted in them helping bind the shredded potato. They came with a Sriracha mayo that was a bit over powering for the delicious tots, but it was good. Bill for 16oz beer, martini, tots, Brussels sprouts and burger, $30! Great value.  There are many interesting looking burger combinations to try including a blend with lamb or andouille sausage and also some intriguing chicken sandwiches as well. There were milkshakes spiked with liquor that I could have made a meal of!   I'd recommend a stop here on a day you're ready to cheat on your diet. It'll be worth it because it's house made dishes and just a bit different than your typical bar food. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Solid list of burgers as well as build your own. I like that their focus is on local ingredients. This even extends to the beer list (which is good) and wine list (not so good, who wants Ohio wine...then again who wants wine with a burger). Happy hour drink specials are nice, and there are some tasty sides and apps."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Service was incredible, great happy hour menu (Long Island iced tea was beyond refreshing), and the appetizers were delicious. I had the chicken club which was packed with flavor. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite burger place in town. Great burgers and other choices on the menu are good too. We would recommended this place to anyone. Kid friendly. Staff is always very nice."}
{"text":"First impression is everything. We just happened to visit location the day of their soft opening. We had finished shopping at the mall. Thought of going to one of our spots for a burger and beer. We saw a new location for the rail and thought to give it a chance.  Parking lot was more full than ever was with giant eagle. When we finally found a spot near the back of the lot and trekked our way to the entrance along with other separate parties that had arrived.  We were turned away at the host stand having been explained it was an invite only soft opening. Had i known that i wouldnt have even turned in. Not only did we have to jockey around to find the parking spots many others literally were competing for, upon leaving we had to turn left out of lot to exit towards 82 west. Anybody that does that know the mall entrance here is a joke and leaving that old GE parking lot is near impossible. A sign saying \"soft opening invites only\" would have been a nice little courtesy!   We've never thought to come back! Got at least 3 bars i get great burgers and dinners, great service, never been turned away and dont deal with that mall entrance!"}
{"text":"So we frequent the one in Montrose quite often. We gave this one a try when it first opened and our orders were burnt. Chicken club, chicken fried sandwich and our burgers were burnt and crunchy. Well we decided to try it again thinking that I'm sure that was not the case after being open for quite some time now.  Well I'm sorry to say that the service was poor and yes you guessed it same dude must have been on the grill.  Burnt beyond recognition.  Best part they actually served it as if we would not notice that the meat was burnt black and well done. That includes the chicken sandwiches. They also didn't have iced tea? Who doesn't have iced tea?  If you want a true Rail experience try the Montrose one. Strongsville Rail needs to take some lessons."}
{"text":"Not a bad burger joint. All foods are local and somewhat healthy. Also a good Variety of beers"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had, bar none. Way better than B Spot. I've been twice now and loved both burgers. First time I had the plain one (Naked Burger?) without a bun and second time I ordered the Local Yokel (Swiss cheese, fried egg). Just terrific. Their fries are great too, exactly how I like them, the skinny delicious ones.  I have no connection whatsoever to the restaurant and only just officially signed up for yelp now, after using it for years, to write this review."}
{"text":"Great spot. Out of town from Portland Oregon. Came in late and hungry and a worker named Angelo greeted us and served us really well. He was attentive, patient and polite with everything we needed. We ended up sticking around later than we planned and he was still super courteous. He made our experience worth it and we plan on coming back for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this location twice now and it was amazing! We came in about 5:30pm on a Saturday and we were seated promptly. We ordered the Mac n' Cheese bites as an app and they were delicious. You could really taste the smoked Gouda and tell they were made from scratch. I ordered the Mr Mariola Burger but I substituted the burger for a veggie burger and got the asparagus as my side. The veggie burger is by far the best I've had and the asparagus was cooked perfectly. My husband had the Crouching Burger(hidden bacon) burger and with a side of tater tots that he enjoyed very much. I tried one of his tater tots( which were the size of a golf ball) and they were very good. Crispy on the outside and soft in the center. The service was great and we didn't have to wait long for our app and food. I love how you can take any burger and sub it for the veggie burger. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at The Rail several times and it really does serve some of the freshest, best seasoned burgers around. Things are pretty simple and a robust make-your-own option ensures that there is something for everyone. I've never had anything at Rail that wasn't tasty, but highlights are the Gouda mac and cheese bites, and the peanut butter brownie milkshake (and the burgers obviously). I've also had really good service every time I've eaten there. The outside areas are nice and there's plenty of screens if you're visiting on game day."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Good burgers, locally sourced ingredients and nice beer selection. They even sell Little Kings- I haven't had one of those since I was in high school...lol.  Anyway, check it out.  I lije the 7th Heaven burger."}
{"text":"I will preface this review by saying that we filled out and left a comment card to give our feedback directly to the restaurant... That said, I feel I have to warn my fellow Yelpers about our experience here.   This place was a huge letdown and in my opinion can't even be compared to B Spot given the subpar food and experience. When we arrived, we were told there would be a 30 minute wait....That would have been fine but there were empty, already bussed tables everywhere! And multiple frustrated groups already waiting outside. Yikes. When we asked the hostesses we were told this was because they \"didn't want to overwhelm the kitchen\". Double yikes.   Our visit pretty much declined from there. Went to order a beer, they were out of 2 of the 3 IPAs on draft. Once we were finally seated, our food took 25+ minutes to arrive. The chicken wrap my Dad ordered was literally inedible - the toughest piece of meat I've ever had (it made jerky seem tender). Burgers were fine, but under-seasoned and the buns were very dense and stale. Don't get the Blue Bessie - a miss in my opinion. Onion rings seemed to be pre-packaged/frozen and the fries were just okay. All seemed overpriced, esp. when considering the quality was worse than say, B Spot across the street or even Five Guys.   Even the decor seemed to be lacking attention to detail. The meat hanger hooks by the kitchen were less than appetizing (even if I'm eating a dead cow, I don't want to think about it hanging there). The chairs were awkwardly close together with lots of high tops and the seats had very little cushion. The standout was our server, Nick. He was very attentive and kept our water glasses full.   We can't think of one reason to go back; not even for a draft beer since they were out of so many. And there are better burgers to be had all over Strongsville!"}
{"text":"Good burgers, but why would I go to the Rail when B Spot is right around the corner for the same price but better food"}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork nachos and a flight of beer. Both were spectacular and the nacho app. Was plenty for a meal."}
{"text":"First time here visiting from LA.   Great happy hour.  Prices very reasonable.  Atmosphere was great, staff was very accommodating and food was freakin awesome!  Try the yokel burger.... soooo good.   Very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered the Bonfire burger.  It had a jalapeño relish on it.  With a side of sweet potato fries. I ordered it medium.  Everything came out as ordered. The taste was amazing. I will go back.    The bartender Steph and back Meg were extremely friendly.  Meg made my time there really enjoyable.  Thanks to her for having a great smile and awesome personality."}
{"text":"The burgers were great, but as you might expect a bit pricey, I had the bonfire burger and with the habenero sauce it definitely brought the heat.  The fries are $2.50 extra and thin cut almost shoe string fries which are not my favorite  Yes they have beer and it was cold so no complaints there.  Service was outstanding the older members of our group can be a handful and our waiter was great with them and funny about it as well.   Only complaints were that it was a little more than I could afford to go to regularly and that they do not have seating for larger parties which caused us a substantial wait while they were not that busy."}
{"text":"This burger place is delicious! I tried their main burger (The Rail Burger) and it was so juicy! I also had their fries, but just the plain ones, I'll try the other flavors next time. And their milkshakes. Delicious. So good! The only problem I have is that their food is a little more pricey than it should be. But this place is great for every once in a while. Overall, great place!"}
{"text":"This place will give B Spot a run for its money. Good burgers, properly cooked, even a bunless option I enjoyed very much. Personable service, huge bar, many TVs, local brews on tap. I think we will be back."}
{"text":"Burgers & food are good, service is horrible!! Waited at least 15-20mins to even order then had to finally ask another waiter to take our order. Slow hostess & very unorganized"}
{"text":"They have the best veggie burger I've ever had. The fries are amazing and I don't really like fries. Decent beer selection and they have some really good mimosas, haha. The milkshakes are amazing. Service is always fantastic (:"}
{"text":"The food here is so good.  I come here specifically for the grilled chicken club.  It is OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Who raves about a grilled chicken sandwich?!?!  It is seriously that good.  The chicken has a wonderful flavor.  The rail mayonnaise they use on this sandwich is a MUST!  And the bun is delicious.  My husband really enjoys the Rail burger and fries.  Also, if they have the fried pretzel nugget bites on the menu, order them!  They don't always have them, only as a special sometimes and they are so good.  And if you get Kory for a server, you are very lucky.  He was so very nice and a great server!  The manager is also nice and often checks in on you while your there."}
{"text":"We arrived and sat at a four top by the windows. In the corner was a pile of wet dirty towels from a previous spill. We place a drink order and app order and within a second my 8 year old spilled her drink. The server was standing at the table and stood there and watched. After about 2 min she asked another server to bring over towels. In the meantime I used what we had to begin cleaning up. The manager walked over and dropped a pile of paper napkins on the table. All our wet linen was left on the table and there was still a pile on the floor from the previous spill. So, I went and picked up those up and started cleaning the floor under our table. I was amazed every one working there watched. No one asked to help, no helped, no one cared. We asked the server for a hand and she was appalled!! I left. Never going back. The poor family next to us had an issue getting their food and it was wrong."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on a drive from Chicago to D.C., and we were pleasantly surprised! The atmosphere was fun, chic, and friendly; the waitstaff was kind and attentive; and the food was incredible.  I had the Bootlegger Burger (with a veggie burger instead of a beef burger), and the other person in my party had the Southwest Chicken Naan sandwich. We also ordered a side of onion rings. The food was outstanding. I'm always impressed with a restaurant that can serve a good veggie burger, and The Rail does just that. It was a perfect stop on a long drive. Although I doubt I will be in the area anytime soon, I wouldn't hesitate to go back again."}
{"text":"Really appreciate the effort to support local products from beer to beef.  Reliably great burgers and my son approves of their sloppy joe.  A little pricey, but I guess that comes with the \"local\"ness."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to visit The Rail for awhile now and finally got to the Strongsville location last week.  Plan on getting there before or after dinner hours or  you will be most likely have a wait.  We arrived at 5:30 on a Saturday evening and had to wait cause we had a large party of 10.  There are not many tables in the restaurant, especially for large parties but the bar area was large enough for all of us to hang out at.  Once seated, we got a really great waiter.  He was funny, attentive and got everything on our orders right. With so many people, it always seems like waiters get a thing a two wrong, but he was great!!  I ordered the Bonfire Burger and substituted with a veggie burger.  It was amazing.  It was not your typical veggie burger and was full of edamame and carrots.  I loved it and would come back for that alone.  The fries had to be ordered separately and were ok.  I am not a big fan of the skinny fries so I would have preferred thicker, more crispy fries. Other then that, I really enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"There are many places to get a burger in this city. This place ranks amongst the best of them. The decor is industrial chic with wood, metal, and glass everywhere. Really cool vibe to the place. The food compliments it perfectly. If you are a fan of red meat, you've found your Huckleberry. They also have a huge selection of craft beers on tap and in bottles, many from local breweries. I've been here more times than I've checked in and have never been disappointed. The fries are the tiny straw variety like you get at Steak-n-shake which is my only gripe. You have to grab a handful of them at once to really enjoy them. If they went to a beer-battered or steak variety, it would be a home run."}
{"text":"Having seen this restaurant in many locations, we decided to give it a try. Very disappointed. The burger, while cooked correctly, was on a bum that was hard & came a la carte. For the price, a side should be included. We watched as bartenders ate & drank behind the bar & the customer service was very lacking. We will not be back."}
{"text":"The Rail is a Burger joint that's been quickly taking over NE Ohio and challenging Michael Simon's B Spot burgers for superior food. Known for their skinny fries they offer a great variety of specialty burgers, toppings as well as other sandwich choices. I personally like to build my own burger with bacon, mushrooms, cheddar cheese and tobacco onions. Their fried chicken sandwich is also delicious. Moist and flavorful!  My mom is still raving about the lamb burger that she enjoyed. Add a great experience with the staff at the Strongsville location and you're got yourself a nice evening out!  The Rail is a four star establishment that's definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Ok, so as soon as we walked in the smell of the grill was amazing. It was sweet but smoky and I totally was ready for a good burger. I ordered a burger with no bun and it had eggs, bacon, lettuce and tomato and was amazing! Will definitely be coming back because I also love the skinny fries! So tasty..."}
{"text":"Came in on a chilly Wednesday night.. restaurant wasn't busy. The hostess sat us by the open garage style windows without asking us if we had a preference. I Ordered southwest chicken naan - everything fell out, naan was hard. I didn't end up eating the full meal. Won't come back to this location."}
{"text":"Great service, nice casual atmosphere, excellent burger. Similar to B-Spot from milkshakes to the way they serve fries and seem to locally source ingredients. You can't go wrong at either place, but The Rail was slightly pricier. We liked The Rail's atmosphere more.  I don't like ala carte approach, however. Three in my party, we ordered one fries and one onion rings (ok, very greasy but what do you expect) for the three of us to split, one milkshake, one beer, one tea and it came to $52+ before tip. That's like $17 per person for burger and partial order of fries/rings, $20+ after tip, and that was during happy hour (drinks, not food). Because of that we probably won't return, but if you can swing that and want a great burger go for it.   Mine was the Blue Bessie: blue cheese, sautéed spinach, horseradish sauce, toated onions. It was really unique and flavorful. What I liked about the burger is that it kind of crumbled as you ate it, like a good one you'd make at home. It was also thick and grilled perfectly. Just wish they were a little more affordable because writing about it has made me want another one."}
{"text":"Stopped by the Rail to enjoy dinner with some family. We sat ourselves at the bar until a table opened for us. Of course I was going to order a burger. I mean, what else is there at a burger joint? They have a great selection of beer too. I wanted an apple pie honey mead, but the bartender didn't know what I was talking about. I ordered a pumpkin ale from Thirsty Dog instead, and it was excellent. We ordered fried mac n cheese as an appetizer and I couldn't stop eating it.  My wife ordered a fried chicken sandwich, which I tasted. It was crispy and delicious.  I ordered a mojo burger with sweet potato fries. About 30 minutes later, our food arrived. My fries were cold, but my burger was pretty warm. The patty consisted of sausage mixed with beef and it was a little tough. It was tasty though. I found myself longing for a 100% beef burger though. So next time, I'll order one. There will definitely be a next time too because the food and service were very good.   With the solid beer selection, no wonder this place is a hit. Great burgers, great service."}
{"text":"5 stars for our waiter Sweet Ian. I walk in with 4 of my friends and his smiling face lit up the whole room and we were in awe of how radiant he is.   The food was delish. We ordered the mac n cheese bites and I couldn't stop eating them. The buffalo ranch match perfectly with the deep fried goodness. I personally had the 7th Heaven Burger with EXTRA bacon. I love bacon. I love truffle. I love beef. It was pretty decent but I wish I added some cheese or sauce. I wish there was more of that red onion jam. I think it was pushed to one side.  I also had the Ohio Peach Sangria and luckily it was happy hour, so it was about half off! Refreshing and not too sweet. I wish I had a bigger glass.  I would've rated this place 4 stars. But Sweet Ian bumped it up to 5. Exceptional customer service. And he complimented on our smiles after he took our group pic. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Customer service is ridiculous. These people don't know anything about customer service and dealing with messed up orders."}
{"text":"The Rail is now serving BRUNCH.  The menu is fantastic -- I ate two meals because I couldn't decide.  Great take on a savory French Toast and the biscuits are to die for!"}
{"text":"Seriously good burger!  I got the 7th Heaven burger with sweet potato fries. Ben, the bartender,  suggested I add fresh mozzarella which was an excellent tip.  He was very nice and on his game.  In and out for lunch in 20 minutes,  got me a to go container and one for my lemonade.   I will definitely be back to check out the beer selection!"}
{"text":"The best music played of any restaurant I've visited (gotta like Alternative).  Ohio beers on a Great draft list.  Awesome.  Oh yeah, food was great as well."}
{"text":"We went for dinner last night and it was just ok.  Definitely wasn't the best burger I ever had.  Our waiter was nice, food was served quickly however the food was just ok.  There were 5 of us and we all said the same thing, \"it's ok\".  I was really hoping for an amazing burger for the price we paid, $11.50 for a burger & $2.50 additional for fries.  My stepdaughter had a milkshake which was very good but also was $6.75.  As my husband said \"been there, done that, check this place off our list\""}
{"text":"I liked everything about this place, except for the burger patty itself.  It was a bit low on flavor, somewhat thick and therefore smaller than the bun.  The flavor just fell flat on the beef patty.  I am being picky, admittedly, but there are a lot of great places to grab a burger in Cleveland.  The fact that it's Ohio sourced beef is amazing.  I'll be back but it will be a couple times a year, not my \"go to\"."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is inviting. Food is Bomb, the 7th Heaven burger is my favorite. Our server Jaz was a doll and my glass was never empty! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this restaurant the feel of it is awesome. The two things that make it interesting the beer and the desserts we didn't get. Everyone's order was cold. The French fries would have been great if they were hot. I had the fried chicken sandwich, it was ok far too dark colored though. My husband had the Mojo burger and wished he had just gotten a plain burger."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice in the past 2 months.  I had a bad experience both times and won't be back.  First time I went it was ice cold in the dining room.  I had to ask 3 different people 3 different times to turn the heat up.  I finally asked to speak to the manager and they told me it had been turned up and would need a few minutes.  It was a large space.  People at the table next to me thanked me for asking.  They were cold, too.  I ordered a burger and fries and had no issue with the food this visit.  Second visit was last week.  I ordered the bison burger special and chips.  Outside of the burger was cooked.  When I got to the middle it was completely raw.  I bit into a huge section of raw meat.  It completely turned my stomach.  I honestly thought I was going to vomit.  They apologized and took the burger off my bill.  I paid for the rest.  I don't expect anything more than that.  They did their job.    Overall, a nice concept.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? There were 3 in my party. When we arrived I was told there will only take 15 to 20 minutes to be seated. So my grandson husband and I waited. 15 goes by. 20 goes by.  30 mins go by. Ok so at this point I go up to the hostess. And wouldn't you know they had tables and a booth available. The hostess was a little mouthy and rolling her eyes. At that point I should have left. My husband ordered a beer and they forgot to bring it. I order my burger well done and it was pink. I'm the type of customer that does not send anything back. My grandson loved his sloppy joe. Our waiter was great. It was our first and last time."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined for lunch at The Rail this past Sunday and had a great experience. We loved the restaurant decor, our waiter was very attentive, the beer selection was fantastic and the food was very good. We tried the mac and cheese bites as an appetizer and they were to die for! Our only disappointment was that our burgers were slightly overcooked. I ordered mine medium-well and it was much more like well done. My husband ordered his medium and his was medium-well. Overall, the flavorings and pairings of condiments on the burgers were excellent. We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a fan of the food at The Rail and make a point to stop in when I'm in town. This was my first time at their Strongsville location and, I have to say, I appreciate the location (away from the mall proper) and setup (relatively more spacious inside).   The Local Yokel is my usual go-to order but this time around I thought I'd try the County Line Chicken Sandwich. While the sandwich was by no means unappetizing, the fried breading seemed a bit overdone and chicken inside tough. The pickles were cut too thick to be enjoyable in my opinion and the coleslaw didn't lend much flavor. Ultimately a pale comparison to Market Garden Brewery's chicken sandwich.   I will say that the service was spectacular during my visit, and I don't intend to let this experience deter me from stopping in again. I noticed a few new additions to the menu that I hope will pan out better."}
