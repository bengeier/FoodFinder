{"text":"Ventured up to this obscure area of Toronto which we have now labeled \"Little Burma\" to this small french bistro sandwiched between the House Of Lancaster, peeler bar and a thrift shop.

White Chalk board menu - steeply priced when you factor in sides separate from your proteins/main.

Fennel Salad was avg and forgettable - with a basic vinagrette
Charcuterie with roast beef on crustini - best dish of the night - seasoned perfect served on a wood platter

Pork & Beans - was expecting a whimsical play on a childhood favorite - received a very uninspired small plate of white beans with a braised pork belly stuck somewhere in limbo between roasted and braised - tasted unfinished

Flat Iron steak - completely under seasoned and searing was not executed well- have had more flavorful meat at the Mongolian grill. 

Our side, potatoes cooked in duck fat (which was eloquently talked up by the attentive staff ) ended us with the feeling of disappointment similar to a finding out your internet date was using a picture from a decade ago and the decade proceeding had not been very kind to him or her at all.

Overall, laziness permeated the entire meal from execution to plating. Maybe the Chef had an off night - but with 1500 restaurants opening in the past year in Toronto alone, it wasn't worthy in concept or experience of another try."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Prices are very reasonable for quality and superior execution. Very friendly and cozy vibe. Bloorcourt is finally getting some good eats!"}
{"text":"I love the whisper light Gnocchi.

And I like the pretty lights..."}
{"text":"Ortolan. How I wanted to like you. 

If only your portions weren't so small and your prices so unreasonable. 

If only your pricey entrees came with some sides. I'm not asking for potatoes drizzled in truffle sauce. I would have been satisfied with a couple of carrot spears with my beef. 

You want to be a hipster when you grow up. Don't we all? But you don't have to be the bitchiest on the block, or include an obscure locavore ingredient on your menu to be legitimate. 

Just start serving up honest, good, food. The rest will fall into place. 

But thumbs up for taking up position behind the House of Lancaster. The ladies in that establishment are friendlier than the servers at Ortolan, though. But then again, I didn't try to stuff a $20 in my server's g-string."}
{"text":"Such a delightful experience all round! Our group went for the tasting menu and recommended wine parings with each course. Not only was the food delicious and the wine parings perfect but I also found it educational, warm and unpretentious. I really got a sense that the staff, chefs, owner etc were like a family and are passionate about what they do. Local fresh ingredients, cooked well means that the price point will be higher BUT I think it was reasonably priced! five courses plus wine pairings for under $100 each is pretty darn good! Oh, and I was treated like a human being! Not always the case at higher end dining establishments."}
{"text":"One of my top 5 restaurants in the city - pretty much neck and neck with campagnolo and bar isabel.  This is an easily overlooked restaurant but it is a huge shame if you do!

Let them cook for you - its so worth it!"}
{"text":"We are always trying new places in our hood and it was Ortolan's turn - it has a nice atmosphere, the server was really friendly. Empty for a Friday night - at 7 p.m. it was just my husband and I and another couple. 

I ordered the Gnocchi with black trumpet mushrooms and the radicchio salad - my hubby the pickerel. I think we were both surprised at the portion sizes. His fish, for $18 was about 1 in. wide and maybe 3 in. long. There are no side dishes, you have to order those separately ($7 for cauliflower) - even when it says parsnips, they are in the sauce, not on the plate. It would be nice to have something on the side.

My gnocchi was good - a bit too salty and, if I'm being completely honest there was something gritty in the sauce that screeched like sand in my teeth. (Just thinking about it gives me chills).

While I love new places in our area, and are so excited to have fresh businesses in Bloordale - I don't think we'll be visiting again soon. There are other hipster places in the area that have a homey feel and delish (cheaper) dishes.  But we gave it a shot!"}
{"text":"Life's too good...not to spend part of it eating at a tiny restaurant named after a tiny bird. 

The prices have gone up a bit since we first discovered the toothsome, and illegal bird. 

(N.B. said bird def. not actually sold at this restaurant...it's just a foodie in-joke, like when Bourdain had Ziggy's character on Treme talk about the Ortolan without infodumping the audience about what he was talking about--+1 by the way for that, Tony, too bad about the rest of your writing on that show---I mean, seriously, Broulard?)

After that digression it seems proper to be as economical as possible for the remainder of the review. 

1) These guys are laying down some serious gnocchi. And yes, they take the easy road by creaming it up with gorgo cheese, but they also take the harder(ish) road by throwing in some wilted radicchio for bittnerness and crunch. Done. 

2) Everytime you go, you eat something you ain't ate before. Last time, it was a kohlrabi salad, and a tartiflette (which was like a stinkcheesepotato fondue aaaamazing)

That's enough for four stars, right? Plus service seems to have embettered itself."}
{"text":"Been there twice. Once as they just opened, second time a month or two ago.
Was never disappointed.
Still on a top list of the meals I've had in Toronto.
Menu changes every day, and even though it's considered French, I would classify it as French-Moroccan fusion, with Middle Eastern influence.
The food is inventive, tastes amazing and the service is always impeccable. 
It's not cheap, but I am very willing to pay for an excellent food and service.
I've noticed a lot of reviews pointing their portion sizes. Honestly, I didn't find them small. Last time we shared an appetizer, got two mains and two sides, as we wanted to try everything. We honestly had no space left for dessert.
Bottom line - it's a restaurant which puts a lot of efforts and passion into their work. And they are doing really well.
You want big portions for nothing - go to McDonalds across the road. Period."}
{"text":"Ortolan is a little gem. The decor is understated and charming. The chalkboard menu is simple and easy to scan. I thought the service was really great, our server seemed really enthused when describing the menu.

I hear the menu changes quite frequently but try the gnocchi which is a staple and really is as good as everyone says it is."}
{"text":"Great service and relaxed ambiance. Our table of 4 had the \"let us cook for you\" menu with 6 courses including dessert. Appetizer was bread with caponata with roasted tomatoes and raisins etc. Second course was Socca and one of the best dishes on the menu. Gnocchi with pan seared tomatoes and fresh salted ricotta was the second best dish on the menu. The chicken and scallops dish was cooked perfectly with a little heat. Skirt steak dish with celery pur√©e also cooked perfectly. Portion sizes were very generous considering the number of courses. I'm not a dessert fan in general so I can't comment on that. However the sentiment at the table was that it was an afterthought. Fantastic wines but limited drink/beer menu. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Came back for another meal and the food is still delicious. The gnocchi is one of the best i've had. The tilapia was very well made too. While the prices are decent, it is a bit expensive for the area, and we would really like larger portions. We ordered 1 appetizer and 1 side to share, and each had our own entrees and was still a bit hungry at the end of the meal. Probably should've ordered 2 apps and 2 sides instead."}
{"text":"Service was good, wine was good, atmosphere was good and company was good! 

We ordered the $45 chef's tasting menu, which included 5 surprise courses, including dessert. I find this type of dining really fun, but not great for picky eaters I suppose. 

This is the way to go! We were stuffed by the end, and the meal felt like good value. Everything was yummy. 

Will return"}
{"text":"Ate at the bar with my friend. Great service. The server/bartender tried his best but he was not great at describing the dishes when we tried to order. 

Assiette de chacuterie please?
What? 
The plate of chacuterie. Oh. Uhm. Yes it comes with ... 
I can just order that to start please. 

That was my conversation with the nice bartender. The pairings could be better. I've had a good one at hoof cocktail bar. I know, coming from black hoof you expect cocktail should be of some quality. The bread that came with it.. i wish it was toasted or fresh, it was a cross between stale and toasted crostini. The terrine was yummy though.


Maybe it's been the hype, but I honestly have had much better gnocchi ... the pasta itself and the sauce that goes with it. My friend had the beef cheeks, it was rather yummy.

Both the pannacotta and the chocolate hazelnut dessert were refreshingly light."}
{"text":"Do you remember those experiments in high school involving hydrophillic and hydrophobic substances?   

That's kind of what this place is.

It's a drop of fine-filtered water in the Exxon Valdez oil spill that is Bloorcourt.

A beautiful room.  Elegant in it's simplicity.   

An open kitchen.  A chalkboard menu.   A small dining area.

It's one of the few places where you truly know that everything is good, because there are only a few menu items...and you can watch other patrons enjoying essentially all of the options as you wait for your chosen delicacy to arrive.

Everything is perfectly prepared.   

Everything is delicious.

I had what was over-simplified as \"Pork Chop & Peaches\".   It was superb.

The whole experience almost makes you forget that this place is right next door to the champagne room at a relatively nasty strip club.   You secretly hope that they don't share a ventilation system with the kitchen.

You imagine that every noise that you quietly overhear through the wall comes merely from the pleasant moving of tables and not from some hooker getting her head smashed open with a bottle.

As long as you don't face the window it becomes easy to become lost in the ambiance of outstanding cuisine.    

Well worth seeking out."}
{"text":"This is how eating is supposed to be. Highly competent cooking that is ever changing, growing with the seasons. 

A small room that is cosy, and romantic (in a Toronto sort of way). 

The food, though, is really the star here. Salads, elegant and interesting. Gnocchi, perfect in form. Proteins, savory and delicious. 

Take a date, or your family, or your friends. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Food was good but nothing spectacular. Won't be rushing back but it is worth trying if you happen to be near the west end. I had the brisket appetizer and the curry fish main. Both were pretty good. I liked the texture combos for the brisket."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Great spot, a fresh menu and premium prices, for the 'hood.

A really liked Ortolan and would easily recommend it, but there's certainly room for improvement. Where it matters the most - the food; it was supreme. I suspect the menu rotates since it's written on the chalk board. My dinner mate and me really thought their beef cheeks (tender, flavourful and not too salty) and their panna cotta were the highlights. We also tried this appy (forget the name) that was akin to brie and apple slices wrapped in a crepe, gnocchi and their side of cooked greens (though, they made this mistakenly instead of our order of a side salad), which we both really enjoyed as well.

While you can sit down at tables, if it's just the 2 of you, I'd recommend sitting at the corner of the bar. Not only do you have a HUGE amount of real estate for all your dishes, we thought the bartender was very friendly and helpful with recommendations. Their wine selection was adequate (sparklings, whites, reds), though their beer selection was rather pitiful (3 bottled beers).

A few things would potentially bump this venue up to 4-stars. They don't take credit cards (I know small businesses and restos feel gauged by credit card companies, but I file this under the \"cost of doing business\"). And while I really enjoyed their food, for the price, I feel that Zocalo offers much more - it's a short walk down the street and they accept credit cards!"}
{"text":"Spectacular. We went to Ortolan two days after it opened and they have their ish together. The service was friendly and the staff very professional. They made great recommendations which is always wonderful because it shows the staff actually takes the time to know what the chefs have created. The two chefs were able to come up with a small but focused and tasty menu to appeal to every pallet. Bottom line they made regular clients of us. Only thing to keep in mind is that side dishes are extra but we shared one and it was just right.( keep in mind neither my husband or I eat like canaries) main dishes range from $10-$20 with side dishes and desserts under$10. Excellent value, great ambiance, must try, gotta love!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dinner, at around 6:30PM.  We were the only ones there.  Staff were friendly, and we had the meal at an unhurried pace with no one rushing us out of there (admittedly, the restaurant was not full by the time we left around 10PM!)  Ordered quite a few dishes - pork rillettes, galette de sarassin, veal ravioli, flat iron steak, tartiflette, and the panna cotta for dessert.  Pork rillettes were tasty, but nothing to write home about.  Liked the endive in the galette de sarassin and the crepe plus brie plus sweet potato (?) was a great combo.  The veal ravioli was good, and the piece de resistance was the flat iron steak, which was covered in white truffle oil.  The steak was perfectly medium rare.  Tartiflette was slightly heavy.  The only reason why the star was missing for me was because something in the panna cotta didn't quite sit right in my stomach, but the bourbon honey was a nice touch!"}
