{"text":"It's OK. It's far from what I would categorize as cajun/creole, probably more like asian with cajun influence. It's a decent food court stop.

Lemon chicken is too sweet for me personally, cajun chicken has a pretty blah sauce - bland and not very flavorful, the bourbon chicken is the best one I've had - i'll  probably try the blackened at some point.

The sides are so/so. Nothing memorable just OK."}
{"text":"My Credit card number was stolen in Maryland.  It was used at this restaurant in Cleveland.  If the employee would of asked for ID when the customer paid with a credit card, maybe I would not of been charged.  Only retailors can stop credit fraud by requesting ID.  Boycott places that don't or you could be next."}
{"text":"Kelly's Cajun used to be my number 2 favorite fast food in the valley. I'd regularly pick up a Blackened Chicken /  Honey Lemon Chicken combo after a long night evening in the lab at ASU. It was quick, the portions were extremely generous, and the Asian family that ran it was always friendly and acted like they were old friends whenever I'd drop by. 

Unfortunately the family that ran it is gone and the food has suffered for it. 

What was once a delectably spicy Cajun flavor on the blackened chicken, is now scaled back severely and is mild by comparision.  The garlic noodles were once actually garlicky are now just slippery and greasy. The Honey Lemon chicken is now overcooked and has lost nearly all of it's unique sweetness. The most egregious difference is that the new ownership has entirely removed the Cajun potatoes from the selection of sides available.

If I were to write this review a year ago, I would have agreed with the other review by W. It was a hidden gem in Arizona Mills mall. It's now just meh. I'm now looking for another spot to get my Cajun fix. Any suggestions?"}
{"text":"This is the least greasy of all the Chinese options at Tower City. While it has some Creole/Cajun options, it really is a fusion of styles and flavors mostly. The line was long and the buffalo chicken was going fast which means FRESH. For two sides and a meat, it's under $6 which is a great option. They also had a small option where you get a meat and one side which seemed very poppy for $4. I would go again and try the small next time as the portion for lunch was enough for two lunches."}
{"text":"I eat at this location frequently and never had any issues - the 2 sides and 1 meat is a ton of food for under $6. Double meat for $1 extra. I really like their orange and bourbon chicken. Lemon is pretty good too. Workers are very nice."}
{"text":"Was lured in by the lemon chicken samples. Great tasting chicken. The rice was boring and I got the regular rice because they wanted to charge extra for the chicken fried rice...but I was ordering chicken! The veggies were very tasty, if not slightly too salty. Over all, it was a good meal. I debated getting the bourbon chicken, so I recommend that as well, based on the sample."}
{"text":"Fried rice was not good. Orange chicken was ok. Very sugary. Price was good.  Fast service. Would come back but i would try something else."}
{"text":"This place is going through an identity crisis. Obviously owned by the Suki Hana next door, there's just a few things here that are really scream Cajun. Blackened fish? Check. Bourbon Chicken? Check. But chow mein and steamed vegetables in soy sauce? Um no. Being served by an entire staff of Chinese people doesn't fool me neither. 

Now the bourbon chicken tasted good enough and you pay about $6 a plate. But their Asiatic version of black bean rice was flat. They should try to create some side dishes to go with the main course meat that you know, are actually Cajun. Like French bread, pea soup, jambalaya rice, Cuban soup or even stuffed peppers. At least the meat was thoroughly cooked and not too greasy. 

The seating is horrible. On any given Sunday, you can sit in their cramped food court and it's almost certain that some fat chick with an oversized diaper bag and her toddler with a leg sticking out will walk behind you, bumping into every chair. And you can forget about trying to carry a conversation in this place."}
{"text":"I just love, love, love the blackened chicken here. Most times I just buy the chicken (no sides) to go.

If you go on a weekday, the food court isn't as crazy insane as on the weekends."}
{"text":"I rarely, if ever, have Cajun food, so when I go to Kelly's, it makes it even that more fun.  They have traditional Cajun/Creole food here, but they have some great vegetarian options too. They also have a ton of seafood and it's delicious!

They have an amazing spicy pasta and rice and beans that are just bursting with flavor and spice.  Really good stuff, especially if you like things a little hot.

And if you want to bring the fam, feel free. This place is very family friendly."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much from a mall food court cajun restaurant. I tried a sample of the Bourbon Chicken and it was incredibly good. So I got that and the cajun shrimp and garlic noodles.

The  Bourbon chicken was nothing like the sample I had just tried even though they got it from the same dish. The one I tried was full of flavor, moist and plump. What I was served was small over cooked pieced of chicken that were bland.

Now regarding the shrimp, maybe this is was how it was supposed to be and I just did not know it, but I did not expect to bite into a FRIED piece of shrimp with the shell and legs still on! Thats right they breaded over the shell. You had to peel the breading off so you could take the shell off.  What a friggin mess. Now I will admit that the shrimp and breading were rather tasty, but so not worth the effort and mess.

Now the noodles. mushy, sticky flavorless. need I say more?
Wont be back to this place ever"}
{"text":"There is definitely some decent food at Kelly's Cajun grill.  I suspect their most popular item is their bourbon chicken. It has a great char grilled, smoky flavor. Coupled with some sides, you can get a huge meal for $6! The green beans are delightful, but the fried rice could use some love. There are several places in tower city that serve similar food, but I think this one tastes the best.

Quick, cheap lunch. Recommend!"}
