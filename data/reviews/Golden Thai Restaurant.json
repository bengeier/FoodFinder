{"text":"We are frequent customers (both take-out and dine-in) and today ordered take-out. Three of the containers that we picked up were barely a third full- the tofu, spicy beef and hot and sour soup. When we called to ask the restaurant about their tiny portion sizes, the female manager we spoke with was super defensive and told us \"that's not possible\". We offered to send a photo (posted here on yelp) so the restaurant could see that our meal looked as if it had been half-eaten, but the manager refused to provide an email or phone number to which we could send an image. When we mentioned that our only recourse would be to post about our experience on yelp, she hung up on us. Disappointing customer service from a restaurant that was once one of our favourites."}
{"text":"service was good, decor was good. food was OK  we got the golden basken which was pretty yummy, and the chicken coconut soup, pretty appetizing.  we got a green curry and a red curry, flavour was way too overwhelming for me. i would say it's just not our style. we couldn't finish the food because everything tasted like creamy curry towards the end of dinner..."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time and love it.  My favourite dishes are the coconut chicken soup, golden baskets, golden thai curry and the cashew chicken.  I've only had 1 disappointing meal and that was the lamb massaman."}
{"text":"Our 'go to' place for decent thai food in Toronto.  Service is good and setting is fine."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant that has held up well over the years... great food, great staff and one of the spiciest martini's I've ever had.  SERIOUSLY... you have to order it!  It'll burn... but it'll burn so good!   Everything on the menu is consistently tasty ... portions are great for sharing and their appetizers are a must!  We regularly dine but be warned, it's smart to call ahead and make a reservation. They can get quite busy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants in Toronto. Soups, Green Curry, Pad Thai, all solid. Can it get better? Yes. After all Bangkok is on the other side of the hemisphere."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the city hands down. Because it's located south on Church, it's a little out of the way, but a great place to eat in or take out. Their hot and sour soup is the absolute best I've ever had. Almost everything I have ever tried, is loaded with flavor and the waiters are very friendly and know the menu inside and out. It's great for groups or dates and can lend itself to a bit more upscale in terms of dress."}
{"text":"Big Thai fan right here (Pi-Tom's sees me at least once a week), and Golden Thai didn't disappoint. Service was awesome, food was great (and kick-started an obsession with coconut rice for me).  I went with my Dad, and we both had spring rolls to start (I had veggie, he had the shrimpie).. I'm usually not a huge spring rolls fan so I don't really have anything to compare these to but they weren't bad. The sauce was delish too! Since it was just my dad and myself and I can't comment on how they are with groups, but I noticed a few big tables around so it seems they encourage it.  It was nice inside and I really don't think the prices reflected the service or the decor (my entree of veggie curry was $8, coconut rice $3.. service 5 stars, decor 4) and I'll definitely go back.  (But I still like Pi-Tom's better!)"}
{"text":"The food is decent. The service was sassy, the older server was unreasonable to my boyfriend's mother when she asked for a box to take home the remaining food on her plate. Maybe the Saturday night rush was causing stress! A good range of options and interesting, traditional decor."}
{"text":"Awesome service, mediocre food. That about sums up my visit to Golden Thai on a Saturday night.  The service here is exceptional. Starting from the beginning with the hostess to the waiter to the food runner. Everybody working there is so nice and down to earth. It was busy, but our waiter still checked up on us often, refilled our water, and wanted to make sure we were enjoying our meal. My cousin wanted extra ice in her water, and the server quickly ran to the sink to dump out some of the water and add more ice, just so that he wouldn't keep us waiting. Would come again to try other dishes because the service was that good!  Unfortunately, the food was a little disappointing. The portions were fine, but the taste was a little off for me. Everything was too salty or too sweet. We started off with the meat appetizer platter which was very good. Loved the fresh rolls as well as the calamari. It came piping hot and fresh from the kitchen. However, the portion for the appetizer was a little small compared to what I was expecting for the price. Next, we ordered the pad thai, but found that it was a little too salty and sour, followed by the crispy chicken thighs with thai sauce. It was OK. Not what I was expecting. Usually chicken thighs are juicy, but these were a bit dry and not as crispy as I would have liked. I also ordered plain egg noodles on the side that were tossed with oyster sauce, but I feel like they would have tasted better if they used less sauce. It was drowning in sauce and was too sweet.  The interior is lovely though. They have real candles at every table and the decor looks very authentic. It's a very ambient space, and would be considered very romantic if not for the noise level. For a place with decently priced dishes, it's actually very fancy!  Perhaps next time, I'll ask the waiter to recommend one of their more popular dishes that have a little more flavour to them rather than just salt or sugar!"}
{"text":"Food was great, would have given it a 5 if it was just a bit cheaper, although the prices were very reasonable for a fancy restaurant like this..."}
{"text":"Was here with a party of eight last night.  The menu was suitable for the mix of veggies, non-veggie and vegan at the table.    Our table was behind a supporting post that had coat hooks.  I liked that I didn't have to put my heavy coat over the back of my chair as it was feeling kind of cramped.  I got used to it after a while, not too bad.  The table had already ordered veggie fresh rolls and spring rolls to start.  I had one of the fresh rolls, it was really good.  They tasted like they were freshly made, not like the yucky, dried-out pre-made rolls at some restaurants.  Nice dipping sauce to go with it too.  Since it was my first time there and I was late, I ordered the Seafood Pad Thai.  I figured this would be safe.  The dish had calamari and shrimp.  There's more calamari than shrimp in this dish, which was fine with me.  Kind of ketchupy tasting, but not bad.  I had ice cream for dessert.  I decided I needed to try three flavours, lychee, mango and vanilla.  Lychee was more like a sorbet.  It had a nice tangy flavour that you would expect a sorbet to have, but didn't really think it tasted like lychee.  The mango ice cream and vanilla ice cream were typical, exactly like I had expected.  The waiters brought extra spoons...unneccessary.  I was a piglet, I ate them all by myself and didn't share.  Also had some ginger tea with lemon.  Our main server was friendly.  He also had a few others helping him bring out food and checking to see if we needed anything else.  I found the wait time for our food was reasonable, didn't feel like I was starving waiting for food to arrive.  Good, efficient service.  Nice atmosphere.  I would go back to try something a little more exciting on the menu than Pad Thai."}
{"text":"I'm automatically in favor of any place that offers extra food for free--the day we went, our server brought us an order of fried bananas for dessert on the house.  The friends I went with go often, and apparently this is pretty common for this place.  The food was tasty and the portions large, but I don't think the food was particularly exceptional."}
{"text":"Chicken fried rice was tasty, but I've had better. Also tried the veg red curry. It was superb. The chicken satay was the best I've tasted in a while. The interior could use a bit of an update, and the wait service could be a bit more attentive. Overall, I had a 4 star experience (solely based on the taste of the food)."}
{"text":"To the Company that Decided to Have a Holiday Party at Golden Thai:  Hi, there! Remember me? I came in with my little party of four trying to catch up with friends while you monopolized 2/3 of the dining room with your employees? Yeah, it's great that you want to share this special time with your colleagues but when you subject other diners to your speeches, we can hear how you made your employees pay for their own meal. Way to show your appreciation! But what else would I expect from a company that was too cheap to rent the entire restaurant, and keep out customers like myself?   By the way, too bad the sales department was so off with their sales projections. My dinner companions and I couldn't stop talking about that and the other enthralling bits of info gleaned from your announcements.  Happy Holidays!  Yours truly, susan \"hire me, please\" c.  With mainly 4- to 5-star ratings on Yelp, I suspect that on most days the food at Golden Thai is great but not so on the night we went. Maybe the CtDtHaHPaGT sucked the life force out of the kitchen, too.  FOOD Four of us shared an assorted appetizer platter for two ($19.95). Most of the stuff was bland or not hot enough temperature-wise like the mushy spring rolls, calamari, chicken and shrimp satay. But the worst offender was the green mango salad which was a soggy mess of indistinguishable fruit strips drowning in a soapy pool of inedible sadness.  The shrimp in the Basil Shrimp ($11.95) were grayish even beneath the spicy red sauce and did not taste fresh. Ew. Chili Garlic Squid ($9.95) was a little too chewy. The Phad Thai ($10.95) was fine but I've had better. The one redeeming dish (and the reason for 2 stars versus 1) was the Chicken Green Curry ($10.95). The flavors were bright and intense; not the usual watered-down curry paste out of a can that you get at most Thai restaurants.  VIBE Much nicer than the ticky-tacky neighborhood Thai joint; the interior looks like someone raided the Grand Palace in Bangkok.  SERVICE Polite but awkward; the waiter got our order of rices wrong.  BATHROOM Reeked of roach spray and I had to hold my breath the whole time I was taking care of business.  GOOD FOR Corporate functions...Not."}
{"text":"Following a disappointing dinner at Salad King, I was craving Thai food for a second night in a row. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Golden Thai.  Golden Thai is everything Salad King is not: tasty, filling, good value.  My companion and I split the lemon chicken soup (just sour enough to make it interesting), the pad thai (not too sweet, not too sticky) and the green chicken curry with a side of coconut rice. We both left incredibly full and with two boxes of leftovers. Yum.  Sunday at 6 p.m., the entire space was packed, so service was a bit slow. (I suppose that's what happens when everything else in the neighbourhood is closed.) But otherwise a terrific experience.  $40 for two people, filled right up to the brim."}
{"text":"3 out of 5! Great choice for large groups! Food is better than Spring Rolls! Not as authentic as KSR or Sukho Thai"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. Beautiful room. Server even remembered Jayne and asked how her daughter was doing at school. Food was full of flavour however the green papaya and chili salad was a bit spicy for the table."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I have been seeking an authentic Thai experience ever since my trip to Thailand.  Though the food at Golden Thai was good and the ambiance was really nice, they did not prepare their food in the traditional Thai manner.    I had their papaya salad, chicken curry, beef with basil salad, and sticky rice with peanut sauce.  Their food had a big Chinese influence; their beef and basil salad was more of a stir-fry.  The price range is good and it's a good date restaurant.  The service was fast and professional.  Overall, I would go back but truly authentic it was not."}
{"text":"Good food, great service, and great atmosphere.  We were looking for a place with an Asian menu, that was within walking distance of the hotel, and that wasn't a chain restaurant.  Yelp rated Golden Thai four stars so we gave it a try.  We were not disappointed.    My five year old had beef satay and my nine year old had the chicken satay.  They shared a side of noodles, too.  They liked everything, although the nine year old said the satay sauce was too sweet.  My wife and I started with some shrimp crackers with peanut sauce. The sauce had a little bit of kaffir lime mixed in -- you could tell from the texture but I wasn't sure I could actually taste the kaffir.  In any case, we liked the sauce.  We also shared a mango salad and an order of fried tofu with vegetables.  We ate all of it.  For dessert, the kids had ice cream (vanilla for one, mango for the other) while my wife and I shared some fried bananas with rum sauce.  We all enjoyed them, although we thought the rum sauce would have been even better with some nutmeg, cloves, or cardaman.  Our waiter, Steve, was professional, friendly (but not obtrusively so) and prompt.  Since we were visiting from out of town, he even gave us some tips on the places to see in Toronto.  Finally, my wife will tell you that I am sensitive to a restaurant's atmosphere.  Golden Thai is decorated in dark colors, with Asian wooden accents on the walls and chandoliers hanging from the ceiling, giving it sort of a colonial feel.  It felt elegant and (despite the prompt service) unhurried.    I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Made a quick lunch visit as our office is near by. Service was fast, meal was cheap, but I was not impressed with the Pad Thai. It came out warm, there were only 4 small pieces of chicken, and 2 shrimp. Could have been better."}
{"text":"My fav thai restaurant!  Tasty food  Nice service Cosy atmosphere   Great for a dinner date."}
{"text":"Had the green curry, spicy noodles, mixed veg in oyster sauce and coconut rice.  Had green tea to drink. Spent $48 including tax and tip.  It was all perfect. Server was efficient and friendly as were the other support staff.  Great Thai experience, a real winner!"}
{"text":"For dessert:  Fried bananas with rum sauce Durian ice cream (!!!)"}
{"text":"Best Thai ever!!!! The service was more than perfect, food was so good and the whole thing is perfect for meat eaters and vegetarians and even vegans. They had my favourite wine (Sauvignon blanc from Marlborough sounds, nz) on the menu. Thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a Thai restaurant for a surprise party and golden Thai was perfect. They gave us the seating area we wanted and accommodated the tables to allow our whole group to fit. They allowed us to bring our own dessert, and they brought it out, with candles, at the appropriate time.  The food was also excellent. From the Pad Thai to the Green Curry, everything we ordered was made to perfection.   The service was just perfect. I want to give a special shout out to Anthony who helped us organize everything.   Thank you, Golden Thai. You will see us again soon."}
{"text":"I contacted Golden Thai about hosting an event following a film premiere at the Toronto Film Festival and their staff went above and beyond in making this event perfect!  When we arrived, the restaurant had been arranged to allow plenty of space for both mingling and sitting down, and everything was ready with plenty of time to spare. The ambiance was wonderful - candles and soft lighting and enough space to have conversation.  The staff was incredibly friendly and beyond accommodating with our guests, and were on hand throughout the night to make sure plates were full, drinks were flowing, and all guests were happy! They were absolutely what made this a fantastic event - they were gracious and helpful without hovering and made all of us feel as ease.  All of the food was DELICIOUS and included plenty of options for everyone - both vegetarians and meat eaters were content! The appetizers were AMAZING and constant - every time I turned around there was a new tray of something I hadn't tried! The waiters frequently offered to refill our plates from the buffet and brought fresh drinks for everyone without prompting.  I cannot recommend Golden Thai highly enough - we had a fantastic event and would absolutely plan another there!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with co workers.... order pad thai on the lunch menu. Noodles were dry and cold and came with two shrimps (I asked for no chicken, they will not add more shrimps). And they don't do separate bills.  Maybe dinner at this place will be a better choice."}
{"text":"Not impressed... the \"coconut\" shrimp (typically my fav\" have to order\" if it is on the menue) looked and tasted like it was prepared in a cheap american diner. Everything else was disappointing including the 'ketchup pad thai'."}
{"text":"Less than impressive. Basically it's at best fast food quality Thai. I found the curry gritty, fried apps soggy and the pad Thai lacking flavor. Not somewhere I will go back to by choice."}
{"text":"We had the green curry and the spicy noodles. The noodles were quiet good but not worth the price of appr. $ 14.   The green curry comes without rice. Which means you have to pay extra for the rice. In my opinion, this is a \"no go\".   All in all the food was delicious, but way over priced!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight great food and great service.  Always drive by this restaurant since the 90s ,  but never been. Now I can say I've tried and say only good things."}
{"text":"Went with 2 colleagues. Nice room, few light bulbs not working in Chandeliers (ok so i am picky, but i think that shows no-one cares). Quick service, too quick. Everything we ordered all came at once. My green curry was cold by the time i got to it. Waiter did not know what Brown Rice was when i asked for it. Veggie appetizer platter, ok. Mango salad bland. OK value for money, but i have tasted better. Staff did not say when we entered that the kitchen closes at 9pm, but we were not offered desserts. Obviously in a hurry to get to see the Olympic Hockey on TV."}
{"text":"What a pathetic Friday night dinner! We really had high expectations with this place going by all the rave reviews on Yelp!   We made reservations for 9 PM, the restaurant was fairly busy when we arrived. We were promptly seated. For appys we ordered the shrimp crackers - you get 4 large crackers with a tasty dipping sauce.  For mains, we ordered the Thai Spicy Noodles with Beef. The noodles had excessive basil in them and were almost vegetarian except for the 4 pieces of beef in them! We also ordered the Chili Basil Lamb which was the same deal - almost no lamb and a bunch of veggies! The lamb was also flavourless.  Definitely not going back, there are many better thai options in TO!"}
{"text":"I had the Yellow Curry and I thought it was great. Delicious flavour, good portion with a variety of vegetables. I didn't love the mango salad, but it didn't matter because the curry was so good."}
{"text":"Excellent service, ambiance, food and price. The restaurant happily caters to vegetarians and vegans alike as noted in their menu! Given that we showed up as a group of 10 with hungry kids included at prime dinner time (7:00 pm), the service staff quickly got things set up and the waiter assisted us in our selections and the food was served fairly quickly."}
{"text":"Normally not a big fan of Thai food but the team decided that we're going to this place.  First thing you notice when you walk in is the Thai theme, traditional Thai style decorations.  Lots of people of course on a Friday noon lunch.  The Pad Thai was good, wish it was a little bit more in terms of portion. Portion was enough though but a little bit more would be better.  All the other lunch dishes my friends got all looked very delicious!  Be warned though the green curry lunch plate can be very spicy, my friend joked he almost had a heart attack because it was so spicy.  Appetizers were great, the shrimps and calamari made me hungry afterwards.   Reasonably priced at around $12 for lunch specials.  Rum sauce fried banana was delicious for dessert."}
{"text":"Les restaurants style thaïlandais sont légion à Toronto pourtant aucun n'arrive à la cheville du Golden Thai : qualité, service et choix. Situé en plein coeur de la ville, au carrefour de Richmond et Church, c'est un restaurant qu'il faut fréquenter sans modération."}
{"text":"My favorite thai in all of Toronto! I drive all the way from Brampton when I am craving thai because this place is so good. I am vegetarian, and they have a great veggie menu with so many options, and they DO NOT put fish or oyster sauce in their veggie options. They get it! Food is amazing, we love everything, and the service is great. Fast, very friendly and prices are very reasonable being downtown Toronto. Highly Recommend!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I ate at Golden Thai was on a date with an ex-boyfriend. Although that relationship ended my love affair with the basil shrimp and coconut rice carries on. The staff are lovely and top class. The food is extraordinary and superbly presented. Toronto is filled with tons of great restaurants, but the ones that stand out from the pact are worth remembering and celebrating."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town.  We had the Thai green curry and a beef curry ( cant remember the exact name ) but both were amazing. we had some wine too ( a tad expensive ) .  Good service, apart from when it got busier our server was harder to get hold of."}
{"text":"I cannot express enough how much I love this restaurant. If you don't mind venturing out in the eastern half of Toronto , then Golden Thai ought to be Numero Uno on your list. Upon entering the restaurant, you are immediately charmed by the decor and ambiance. With high ceilings and low hanging chandeliers, simple table setting and indoor banana trees, it almost feels like you have been transposed to a colonial era which is ironic since Thailand (Siam back then) was the only country in South East Asia that had never been  colonized. Once you are done marveling the lighting and ceiling...you can feast your eyes on the art pieces hung on the wall and placed around the restaurant...in true Siam fashion, the art pieces feature the Buddha or traditional palaces. There are some standing pieces of the Buddha and Garuda (which is my favorite for more reasons than one).   Once you are seated, you are greeted warmly by F-O-H staff members and lead to your table and your wait staff ( who almost always remember what you order) brings over the menus. The menu is simple and not fussy at all, which for a change is nice to have!    For appetizers I would highly recommend the Spicy Calamari. If you want to start off with soup, then Tom Yam Gai might be the way to start off...its as if the lemongrass and lime juice purposely open up your senses so that you may enjoy the incoming main courses to the full extent :)   Now for Main Courses - I ve always been a little bias towards anything noodle so I usually order either the Pad Thai or the Egg noodle...both are equally delish by their own right!  Main courses that I love are :   1. Phad Phak Raummid 2. Green Chicken Curry (no seriously ...its great)  3. Mussaman Beef Curry  4. The Tamarind or Ginger sauces Fish...both are great!   We always end our dinner with the quintessential Sticky Rice with Mango :)   Golden Thai is probably my favorite Thai place to go to..."}
{"text":"My 2nd time here and both times the food was great including the service! Great place for a date and with friends. Give it a try :)"}
{"text":"Arguably one of the best THAI restaurants I've ever stepped in. From the food to the atmosphere and to the price of the meal. Wow. That is all I have to say.   I am so impressed and although the wait time for a table is long (if you don't have reservations, so reserve yourself a table), ooooh girl you better be prepared to wait for yo ass to get seated because it will be a long wait, HOWEVER, it definitely was worth the hour that my sister and I waited when we first ate here last summer. My family and I live in Scarborough and we drive all the way downtown just to have their food here.   Recommendations: Green Curry Chicken Pineapple Fried Rice Pad Thai - BEST i've tasted so far."}
{"text":"Tried the veg pad thai here last year and I've been meaning to go back. This place is a must if you've never been.  Really cool interior (dim lighting and chandeliers, more on the quiet side), amazing staff, looks a little intimidating from the outside but some places in Toronto are like that and they end up being the best places I've tried.  Good food, excellent selection, timely service, no complaints at all on this one."}
{"text":"Great lunch special for about $12 with many options.  Very tasty Thai food, and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Good , honest , fast  And reasonably priced  Love it One of my all time fav Try the spicy rice  And lam curry"}
{"text":"This little local thai restaurant boasts white linen tables, large dining space, beautiful decor and great food to match.  Whether I'm sharing plates with a group of friends family style of having my own favorite dish of pad thai the food here is consistently of excellent quality and packed full of flavor.   Portions are large plates themselves are quite small and at time food ends up on the table.  Cocktails are OK not something I would recommend (small glasses for the price) but to catch up with friends or for a date this restaurant is great!"}
{"text":"Golden Thai, thank you for being open late enough for my final dinner in Toronto!  This restaurant is very clean and their service is A+. I had peanut curry for dinner and a sweet and spicy salad. It was my first time having fresh lychee."}
{"text":"Each time I go I comment on the decor and the restaurant itself.  It's also not too loud, you can carry on a decent conversation and the other tables aren't too close.  The food is pretty good, there's a lot to choose from on the menu, and the portions are a good size. The food itself is not amazing, but quite good.  The wait staff are helpful and patient.  I'd definately go back..."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a nice atmosphere and has a very traditional Thai feeling. The spring rolls were absolutely delicious and would definitely go back for those. However, I did not enjoy the pad Thai it was way too sweet and for that they are getting three stars."}
{"text":"Been here once and it was a great visit.  It was crazy-packed inside but once we were seated (had to wait about 10 minutes - during that time, had a friendly conversation with the bartender), the service was extremely quick, efficient, and organized.  I had the Thai spicy noodles with chicken and it was an exceptionally good noodle dish.  It had just the right amount of heat and featured perfectly cooked vegetables with nice morsels of chicken.  I devoured it within minutes and left very satisfied."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. The food never disappoints. Next to Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas, this is my favorite Thai restaurant in North America. You cannot go wrong with the pad Thai. Today for lunch, I had the lamb Chang Mai. It was served with fried rice, mango salad, vegetables with a Penang curry sauce, and yams. The meal was fantastic, and it was a terrific value. I love Golden Thai!"}
{"text":"I went here based on the recommendations on Yelp.  It was all I thought it would be.  I went on a Monday night and it was at least half full.  The service was great as was the food.  I highly recommend Golden Thai!!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I shared a very tasty meal at this restaurant. We had the golden special for two. All the dishes were full of flavour and diversified. The servings were for more than two people, which allowed us to bring some home for lunch the next day. The staff was very kind and quick with our orders. And finally. The decor of the restaurant is both traditional and elegant with its chandeliers to glam up the space. This is a gem of a place to discover."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor. Great service. Food presented nicely but tasted kinda off for me.  I guess the ketchup-y Pad Thai got to me. The home-made coconut and mango ice cream was good."}
{"text":"This is a perennial fav for a friend's family so I end up here every once in a while. With the most other Thai places offering almost the same menu with almost same taste profiles (decent) this visit was a let down. We ordered the following Golden Baskets: One of the better dish is worth trying as an alternate to the spring rolls. Mango Salad: Below average not tart at all. Mild flavors Veggie Salad: Meh Pad Thai; A big disappointment IMO extremely salty. Panang Chicken. While the curry was nice there was hardly meat in the dish we had two orders of this dish and both were stingy on the meat. Ginger chicken: Below average IMO and is more of a food court level offering Basil Shrimp: Very average hardly any taste profiles. We ended up ordering the cashew chicken afterwards as needed more food. Cashew chicken was decent. Its hard to recommend this place with competition being consistent and decent. 2.5 stars due to good service otherwise this place is a pass IMO"}
{"text":"For entertaining clients, you can't beat it.  Most of my friends love this place, I find it is good, but not the best.  The decor is very nice, the service is great, the presentation is great but the food is less than award winning but easy to over look with everything else being bang on."}
{"text":"I have ordered take out 2 times from here and am so surprised at how delicious the food is. It's hard to find a good Thai place in Toronto, but this one is a great. The Pad Sew comes with fresh veggies and might be the best I've had. The green and red curry are also very flavourful and creamy, there could be a bit more chicken in these dishes but the flavour is great. I am giving 4/5 because of the small portion of meat in the food."}
{"text":"There is no shortage of Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto, however, it is rare to find one, at this price point, which such delicious food!  I ordered take out recently: 2 pad thai, red curry chicken, spring rolls and lamb skewers.  The entire meal (with taxes, but before tip) came to $53 and change! Everything was flavourful and the portions were large.   Golden Thai is, by far, the best thai food I've had in this area. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Like the decor there, super Thai-style. Had Spicy Thai Noodles which was good.   Five of us ordered separately but they didn't separate the bill in the end, so we had to divide into 5 and pay equally, given that someone ordered more and someone ordered less, I had to say it is unprofessional."}
{"text":"Golden Thai is a solid Thai experience in the downtown core. First, I'll say that the ambiance is actually very nice! It's a real pleasure to eat here and it's a solid date location if that's what you're looking for.  The food here is also pretty good. I've had better, but I cannot complain and I'm confident that you will be fine with whatever you order.  Once upon a time, I had much preferred another Thai place that was down the street by about a block. That place had been the first Thai Restaurant to open in Toronto and I was sad when it finally closed. Golden Thai survived though and if anything, you can say that their survival has to mean something.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here. The Peanut Curry was great, and my wife's Cashew Chicken was juicy and sweet. Well done!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan because of the value for money. Great food at a reasonable price. It is one of our favorite places for team lunch. We get the lunch special of 2 to 4 combinations. Huge portions."}
{"text":"There are many restaurants downtown however this one serves amazing food at a great price. Their coco shrimp plate and veggie spring rolls are amazing (at a great value). The setting of the restaurant is warn and welcoming, great place to go on a first date or just have a nice family dinner. They also have great lunch specials which go as cheap at $10.25.  If you have not gone to this restaurant yet and love Thai food, you should give it a try."}
{"text":"The service was great and we were just about the only people in the place. Not the best Thai food I've ever had, but the portions were generous and the food was a great price!"}
{"text":"As an International Pooping Expert, I take great pride in my knowledge of toilets which provide the best pooping experiences.  The toilet is the men's washroom was completely off the mark. Literally. The toilet was installed on a 45 degree angle, leading me to question the sanity of the plumbers. How is one to enjoy his poop if his knees are being forced  against the cold wall? I was debating about squatting over the toilet, but I simply lack the flexibility. I hope the brave women dining at this restaurant are not put through the same torture.  The green curry beef was ok though."}
{"text":"Really bad service. Food is just okay. Would not recommend to friends. The place was not busy during the time we went but the service was slow and inattentive. It was very rude when the server would ignore us when we try to call him over, even when we made eye contact. When he try to take away the change after we paid, He even threw the bill dish back on the table when we said we weren't done with the change. It was ridiculous."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant so much. My cousin and I visited this spot on our Easter weekend vacation. The food and service was amazing! The staff were very welcoming, the menu had a good variety of options. Their liquor options were good and affordable. The decor was authentic and pleasing to the eye. Overall I had a great dinner service there. I recommend if you are in the downtown Toronto area."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times but my last visit a few weeks ago will be my last. I really wanted to like this place since I live a block away but realistically speaking, it is cheap imitation Thai food made by likely Chinese chefs. The appetizer platter was satisfactory but the pad Thai is plain and tasteless. The curry is bland and unappetizing. The last straw was the experience as we were handed the bill when my wife and I didn't even get our entree yet, of course our friends had already eaten their food. When we asked for an explanation, there was none and no answer from the manager. This was a Saturday evening and it was not busy, so there was no rush to have us pay the bill and leave. When our food finally came, of course with no explanation from the waiter, we took it to go and dropped it off at the homeless shelter. No free entrees or apologies from this place. If you want much better food and service, just walk down to sukho Thai, I will be from now on."}
{"text":"We went there quite some time ago but still wanted to write a review. The style of the place is interesting and the food was good. I don't remember much about the service but we didn't have a bad experience. We had soup, some curries and desert."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened around 25 years ago. It used to be the best Thai restaurant in Toronto, hands down. I lived in other places for a while and would always make a point to stop here every time I was in town. It's been out go-to place for special events and I've been recommending this place to people for years. Now that I've moved back I visit fairly regularly. Unfortunately, over the past year, the quality has seriously declined. It's still a beautiful place with excellent service, but the food has become mediocre and even unpleasant. I was there the other day for my birthday and the food was a huge disappointment --everything tasted like it came from a kit -- overly salty, bland and plastic tasting. The Pad Thai (which was the best I've ever had) has gone from a flavourful dish filled with veggies and proteins to a sad pile of pasty, flavourless noodles and bean sprouts. This is beyond sad for me because I've loved this place for so long. I know it's under the same ownership, but maybe they've been making a poor choice in chefs? This was also the first time I've ever been to the place that it wasn't packed. Please check your kitchen. Don't let 25 years of brilliance be destroyed. You know how to do it right."}
{"text":"This is becoming my go to lunch place during work week. Their lunch menu is very diverse and had quite a few vegetarian options. The total usually comes up under $11. I like their tempeh curry and spring rolls.  Note for vegetarians: Make sure when you order lunch deal to order just a plain rice since noodles/rice in the lunch option have oyster sauce in them. Coconut ice cream with pineapple is a delicious dessert as well:) And I love love love the atmosphere! It feels and looks very upscale with the wooden dividers, heavy curtains, chandeliers and waiters dressed up in button ups. Makes me feel as if I'm an aristocrat:))"}
{"text":"Appetizer for Two $20.95  Fried Grouper in Coconut Curry Sauce $23.95  Pad Thai $11.95  Mixed Vegetable $8.95  After a long day/drive to and from Niagara Falls, my wife and I came here with a couple of her friends for dinner. The building from the outside looks very old but inside its very decorated with Thai antiques. The appetizer came with hot and cool spring rolls, calamari, chicken satay, shrimp satay, and green mango salad. Everything was delicious and well seasoned. It was a good enough starter for 4 of us. The pad thai was on the sweet side as it was tossed in a sweet chili sauce. The fish was great, nicely fried, and not greasy at all. The vegetables were nothing special and the portion was a little on the small side. Overall, I would say this place is a hidden gem in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"lychee and mango salad was good but ratio of mango vs other \"filler\" vegetables in the mix was low. Didnt like the coconut rice - didnt even taste the coconut and didnt like the texture. Pad thai (vegetarian, with tamarind sauce...there's three sauce choices) was ok but tasted a bit too Westernized. Green curry was good. Had the fried rum bananas for dessert - good size to share between two ppl and that was good. Overall, I felt the thai food didnt taste very authentic and I've had better. Service was good and ambiance was good, though"}
{"text":"Had the lamb basil, cashew chicken, and glass noodles. All of the food we tried was very good. However, portions aren't that big and the price point is pretty high."}
{"text":"This place officially ruined all of New York City's Thai food for me. Toronto has a few \"Best Of\" places that stand out in my mind & this was one of them. Really fresh ingredients that came together to create a beautiful & memorable meal. Very impressive!"}
{"text":"Not great. Curry had a chalky consistency. I live across the street, I've tried a few things soups, curries, lunch specials - I won't be going back again."}
{"text":"I remember passing by this place ever since I was a kid. The signage and the building are so arresting that you can never really forget it. It took 26 years, but I finally made it inside.   This place is like walking back in time. Near the front entrance you will see what looks like an old air conditioner from the 80's. I doubt it works but it's just soo cool to see. The door, furniture, and decor retain a simplicity in style that will remind you of a museum.   The most stand out thing about the food is the value! the prices are incredibly fair. and the food is amazing! Just simple dishes prepared impeccably. The menu is long and begs to be explored.   It's kind of an iconic place for true Torontonians who have passed by it's doors for 26 years.  I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  I've come here for a lunch a couple of times. They have a lunch menu but unfortunately the items I wanted had gluten in them so I had to order them off their a-la-carte menu. Their lunch specials are pre-made so can't be altered, and they come with a deep friend spring roll which isn't gluten-free. However their regular menu does offer an extensive selection of dishes and many are already gluten-free. Both times my dishes were delicious and I did not have a reaction.   Also, the service is quite attentive and the food comes out quickly. So this is a great place to go for lunch on a weekday when you have to get back to the office on time.   They also said they do not offer split bills, but they allowed my table to split the bill equally and let everyone pay individually by card. So they're quite accommodating.   TL;DR - lots of gluten-free options, great service"}
{"text":"It's more like 3.5 stars. This is easily the best \"atmosphere\" Thai restaurant in the city. Beautiful lights, statues, and high ceilings. Service is also attentive and pleasant.   Food wise I was slightly disappointed but still a pass. I thought the pad thai was a little ketchupy and the other noodle dish I had tasted very similar to Chinese stir-fry. Portion was small while prices are higher than other Thai places.   You come here for the atmosphere, like for a date. But if you want good value, this is not the right place. It may just be my taste preference but I like other restaurant's Thai noodles more than here."}
{"text":"I came to Golden Thai on Canada Day with a few friends. After failing to find a Japanese restaurant with a shorter wait time than one hour, we resorted to coming here. It was  still packed, don't get me wrong, and we were glad there was some seating.    However, we were all very disappointed with the food and service. We ordered a range of calamari, beef,  and lamb dishes.  The portions were regrettably small for their price (12-15 plus dollars ea.).  There were only a few slices of meat in proportion to the amount of vegetables that conquered each dish. The worst of all was the price for rice. All other restaurants that I have frequented charges about $1.50 per bowl of rice, but here they charge $2.95 per bowl (same average size for those who are wondering) - that's nearly double the price!   Furthermore, it took what seemed like years to have a server take our order and even longer to receive the food. The server designated to our table never apologised, smiled, or even asked how we were doing. When the bill came along (20 mins after asking for it), I was able to speak to another server and he apologised and explained they were down by two servers that night. My irritation was thankfully abated by this server because he at least tried to smile, apologised for any mishaps, and communicated any complications.    The decor at Golden Thai is a plus, but you don't go to a restaurant for the decor alone."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful Thai food.  The lunch special is good value and very filling.  Lunch for two with no drinks came to exactly $20.00.  Spring rolls are excellent and the dipping sauce used is above average.  Service was fine given that it was the lunch rush.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. My 10 and 11 year old children had the Pad Se Ew and enjoyed it. The Golden Thai Shrimp had a nice heat to it. I enjoyed their Gingeretto cocktail, which is freshly brewed ginger tea with amaretto. It is served warm. The pineapple with coconut ice cream was the perfect ending to dinner.   They do have wifi. Just ask for the password."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite Thai restaurant in downtown Toronto. Their food was well done and tasty. We ordered the shrimp fried rice, tamarind tofu, and golden Thai chicken. I am not a fan of Tofu, but however the tamarind tofu was great and just left me short of words. Great ambiance and great service. The food arrived within 10 minutes to be exact."}
{"text":"When it comes to SE Asian food, I'm always in search of an authentic experience. A place that replicate can the thrill and flavours of streetcar food (minus the dust and the likelihood of subsequent food poisoning), a place that can reproduce the same heat from green curry and that same slow burning sensation...  Golden Thai does a decent job. Their vegetable rolls were lovely although I could have done with more interesting sauce as opposed to your standard sweet chili affair. As in Thailand, they're very aware of vegetarianism and can cater meals to suit most dietary restrictions. The spicy eggplant is a must-try."}
{"text":"it's been there as long as I remember. Food is consistently great- I am a big fan of shrimp crackers and their set menu is of good value. Service though is hit or miss. The last time I was there, we had enough left over. Asked the server to pack the 4 dishes we wanted to take home- he piled all 4 plates on top of each other! WTF! He also packed everything in 2 little containers. WOWZA, gross! I guess he dozzed off during 'serving 101 class'.. Next time you have left over, please be vigilant."}
{"text":"great service and decor, but the food is just... meh... can totally get the same food at thai express. DONT order tom yam goong there, totally not worth it... just chicken broth + tons of spice. if u want a romantic date night, come here; if u just want great thai food, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I came for lunch during the week and apparently 1130p is a good time to go because the crowd started pouring in shortly after.  The restaurant is big and the décor is nice and pleasant.  The service was fast and friendly.  They offer a special lunch menu with 8 main dish choices.  1 choice $8, 1 choice + Veg spring roll = $8.50, 2 choices + Veg spring roll $9.50, and 3 choices + Veg spring roll $10.50.  All lunch specials are served with fried rice, noodles and salad.  Chicken Fried Rice $10 - The fried rice is decent and makes a nice quick lunch.  It came out really fast.  Thai Iced Tea $3.50 - This doesn't taste like your typical Thai Iced Tea.  It has a strong flavor that I couldn't identify what it was.  It tasted good, but not the flavor I'm used to.  They take credit cards, including American Express."}
{"text":"I had a very respectable, well-priced Pad Thai here. Out of the many Thai establishments in Toronto, this is seemed to be a reasonable option. Pai is certainly more of a mouth-watering experience, but more crowded and more expensive. The decor here is quite neat!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, portions small, and the variety of hot sauces (upon request) is huge.  The red and green curries were awesome and as requested, hot (heat level). I'm used to the cheaper east end restaurants, but the food here, though on the pricey side, was several notches above in taste and authenticity. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Delicious traditional Thai dishes, this is one of the better Thai restaurants I've tried. Very satisfying meals and quality ingredients. And the décor and atmosphere is really, I come here for lunch but imagine it would be great for dinner too."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for dinner.  Shared a coconut chicken soup we both loved.  Shared pad Thai and cashew chicken.  Enjoyed everything.  Great service, tasty food, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The environment is lively and upscale, but not in a snobbish way. Food is delicious--best Pad Thai I've had in years!"}
{"text":"-polite and attentive waitstaff  -filling soups, appetizers, and mains  - I would recommend leaving room for the homemade coconut ice cream"}
{"text":"If I could do it again...I wouldn't! It started off great- the environment is nice and there were beautiful orchids decorating the place. We were very excited. But then we met our waiter. He was incredibly short tempered with us. He seemed annoyed when we asked questions and was very unfriendly. The spring rolls we ordered were very tasty so we thought it was going to be a great meal. The pad thai I ordered came out pink in color and was covered in some sort of sweet sauce (maybe this is what traditional pad thai is like but I've never had anything like it). The shrimp curry only had 5 medium shrimp in it and the curry was like a gravy. Maybe we just ordered poor choices (the menu has nearly a million options) but I wouldn't go back to test that theory."}
{"text":"Went in for a late dinner on Saturday night. I used to work in the area and frequently went in for their lunch specials, but its been a few months since I've gotten to try it out so was glad to be in the area looking for food.  The full dinner menu is very comprehensive with lots of great options which made settling on something a task in itself.   The apps were pretty good. We had the spring rolls and the Golden Baskets which are a neat little finger food with a curry flavour. The spring rolls were excellent, and the Golden Baskets good although perhaps some sauce to dip them in would make them better.  For dinner, I had the Golden Thai Pork. I figured that if it was named after the place it would have to be good, and it was! A delicious blend of coconut and curry with tender stir fry pork and vegetables. Normally I like spicier curry flavours but this had a savoury quality that was so good that I didn't even care to add hot sauce. My date had a the Phad Won Sen which was a chicken dish with glass noodles and some kind of sauce which she liked as well.   But really the thing that seals the deal for this place is the decor and atmosphere. It has nice design esthetics, soft lighting, and a somewhat upscale vibe but is not pretentious or stuck up. A lot of thai places either are way too casual or downright cafeteria style seating, or they go for the fancier high end which is also reflective in the portions and pricing. This place sits right in the middle to be comfortable, affordable (most plates in the $11-$15), but still impressive and a great date spot."}
{"text":"Tip: Appetizer Combo for one can be shared among 2 people  Tip: Soups can be shared and they will bring two bowls out for you  In the evening the room takes on a warmth that makes for a comfortable experience that also allows conversation.  TOM KHA GOONG: SHRIMP COCONUT 9.95.   A delicious soup however could not find any squid as mentioned in the menu.   APPETIZER PLATTER FOR ONE 11.95  As suggested it can be shared and they will split up the rolls for you. Crispy spring roll and a cold spring roll, calamari rings, chicken satay, shrimp satay, and green mango salad.  The calamari were not at their best but everything else was fresh  SEAFOOD PHAD THAI 12.95. Typical Phad thai tossed with shrimp and squid. Lots of tofu and veggies.  The calamari or squid was not at its best, other than that it was a decent plate  Service is very attentive and they served a real ginger tea. They had no issues with splitting plates and the space was very comfortable and inviting.  A good restaurant but I did have higher expectations only because its a full service sit down restaurant with glorious decor but its food is not any better than take out at a fast food thai place."}
{"text":"Another semi-tucked away Thai gem! Just off of the downtown Financial District area- very convenient for weekday lunches or unique dinner dates (there is a bar!). The interior design channels exotic rainforest, from the giant plants throughout to the abundance of natural light. The restaurant is pretty spacious and during the weekdays in the evenings it's not too packed, so no crazy lineups to get seated and no need to strain yourself trying to have a conversation across the table. Large groups can be easily accommodated, but make a reservation in advance.  Price-wise it's much cheaper than other downtown Thai sit-downs, like Pai or Sukhothai. Portion sizes are sufficient.  Excellent service - very warm servers, always willing to help.  So why 3/5 stars??? The food... More specifically, the taste and flavors... Very mediocre. I ordered the vegetarian for 2 dinner combo, which came with spring rolls, pad thai, stirfry veggies, and banana fritters for dessert, and unfortunately, despite the beautiful presentation the flavors and quality of the ingredients resembled that of fast food. Could have just gone to Thai Express down the street. However, if I do come again for lunch/dinner I will for sure try the curry as that was not part of the combo and I deeply regret not ordering it!  ----- I did order the mango sticky rice dessert on a separate day as takeout and was again disappointed by the way this dish seemed to be hastily slapped together. There was minimal coconut sauce, the rice was rubbery and didn't seem freshly cooked, and the whole assemble just looked and tasted very, very mediocre. This was probably the worst mango sticky rice I have ever had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Ok well, there's really nothing golden about this place. The food is so-so and really doesn't taste like anything. Uncle Ben's please. I can't forsee ever going back."}
{"text":"I was very UPSET with this restaurant. I offered them my business into hosting a party of 25 people at their restaurant. After showing me where my party would be seated, the host, all of a sudden repeatedly tells me he wouldn't be able to do it. I asked why and he responded that it would get too busy and  looks into his empty agenda.   He shrugged me off and told me to call the manager, Jimmy, in the morning to ask him I would be able to book it. I didn't even bother. The restaurant would've had new customers, and MOST LIKELY new regulars."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in the downtown Toronto entertainment district... The food is good, though the service and decor need some work."}
{"text":"Was here this past weekend as part of a friends and family celebration in honour of the birth of a baby boy.  The service was awesome and the food was absolutely delicious. We were served buffet style and I tried one of everything! My faves were the coconut shrimp, vegetable salad rolls, and the cashew chicken. Nice level of spice and not greasy at all.  I enjoyed a warm cocktail with my meal (I forgot the name, boo!) . It consisted of house made ginger tea, cinnamon, brown sugar, and amaretto. Just perfect for a chilly night!  The restaurant itself is pretty gorgeous inside, with lots of beautiful light fixtures and various statues. Great for a date night or even a fam jam. I will definitely return when I am in this area again!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch as it was a convenient location. What a surprise. The daily lunch special is excellent as well as reasonably priced. Service quick and friendly. Overall atmosphere is best described as visual eye candy.   Is it genuine Thai?  I don't really know. Asian cooking in the city has pretty much blended together to the point where I doubt there are many, if any, 'true' cuisine establishments.   That's what makes T.O. unique.   Over the past forty or so years this location has pretty much been one sort of restaurant or another.  If you're in the area Golden Thai should be on your go to list."}
{"text":"The hot n sour soup is seriously the best I've ever tasted.  Don't miss the golden fried tofu, the red curry. Seriously....nothing was bad. Not ridiculously pricey, friendly staff and large tables accommodate big families.  Get the mango slushie.  Parking on street but close to subway stop. Go!!!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on a weeknight and it was not too busy maybe 6 other tables. For some reason we were seated in the corner away from everyone else which probably contributed to the long wait we had to endure before we were served.  Foodwise we ordered the spicy eggplant, golden Thai chicken, coconut rice, and mango sticky rice for dessert. The taste was fairly average. I mean it wasn't bad but also nothing special either. The red curry in the chicken wasn't particularly flavorful and I was especially disappointed in the coconut rice as it should be very aromatic but this one smelled and tasted almost like plain rice. The portions were a little on the small side as well as we left still hungry.  The service left a lot to be desired. I had to ask several times before we were able to order and we were checked on only once throughout our entire meal. No plates were cleared even though our table was full until our bill came (which came immediately after we finished).  I don't think I will be visiting this restaurant again anytime soon. Maybe in a few years but definitely not at this moment. The decor was nice but other than that it's nothing special given all the amazing Thai places in Toronto."}
{"text":"I stayed in a nearby hotel and was looking for a good bite to eat. I found this place and loved it. The décor was lovely. A great place for a romantic or social dinner with friends. The staff were friendly and helpful. I was looking for vegetarian options and they all happen to be vegan which was a bonus!   I recommend the spicy egg plant and Pad Thai. Mmm!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have given anything online 5 stars because there is always room for improvement, but not here. Best Thai I have had in Toronto!  Rice is not greasy, green curry and cashew chicken are phenomenal. Great job Golden Thai!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Golden Thai since I've been looking for a good restaurant in Toronto that served Larb, however I left unsatisfied. Service was great, but the food was not so good and seemed really westernized in my opinion. I was surprised to see kale used in a lot of the dishes instead of lettuce (which is traditionally used for lettuce wraps). The mango salad should have been called beansprout salad, as there was hardly any mango at all, and the larb that I was anticipating to try lacked flavour. With other Thai restaurants nearby, Golden Thai is below par and is comparable to what you can find at a food court."}
{"text":"I came on a busy Friday evening at around 7:15 pm. Based on the number of servers whizzing about, you would think that the service will be clean and fast.  Although my waiter is pleasant, he was apologetic when making the mistakes. My order of rice (for example) did not arrive until midway through the meal. My non-vegetarian spring rolls became vegetarian and the order was not fixed until the end of the meal.  As for the food, nothing special about the Thai dishes. They were priced at market to the comparable Thai places in downtown (even on the  less pricey end of the range ie. cheaper than Nana)  The Tom Kha soup was delicious - thicker and more coconut flavoured than other places. Also tons of mushrooms and chicken floats about. This is a bowl of soup for 2 people or 4 to 6 mini Asian bowls in servings.  There was nothing special about the spring rolls. Fried well, but nothing memorable."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's generally been quite consistent. Nice atmosphere, good service and decent food. My favourites are the panang chicken curry (red) and the green curry. Good tom yum soup and delicious spring rolls, too. I enjoyed the pad thai, but other members of my group found it to be a let-down  (to be fair, I've never met a pad thai that I didn't like, so take my opinions on pad thai with a grain of salt.)  Other good bets- the spicy eggplant, basil chicken and cashew chicken.  Pretty standard and tasty.   Overall, decent food, decent prices, but it's no Salad King.  I'd eat here again, but am not in a rush to get back."}
{"text":"Got a takeout from Ritual. I ordered golden baskets, lemon chicken soup and coconut chick soup. The soup containers were half empty (or half filled if you look optimistically) The soups were also very thin and do not have much flavour in it. Golden baskets consist of few toonie-sized deep fried spring-roll-like skin wrapped with grounded chicken and vegetable, which actually tastes ok.  Also, afterwards I felt stomachache, not sure it is an issue brought by their food. Anyway there are certainly a lot better Thai food in Downtown and you can certainly avoid this one."}
{"text":"I had the lunch special and it came with day old fried rice, cheap noodles, 1 spring roll and a bit of chicken. It may make for cheerful bill at the end of the meal but it's not worth it.  The meals from the main menu had a much better presentation. I might go for one of those, if I ever return.  In terms of decor, it's an old restaurant with crystal chandeliers. Huge Thai buddhas and Thai motif decorate the place. It's easy to find table for large groups during lunch time."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Definitely not the best in Toronto and tastes very similar to Thai food you would get in a mall. The dish that I ordered was very saucy and kinda sweet which was odd. But the serve was excellent and the ambiance was awesome (Very quiet and not busy)."}
{"text":"Food wasn't that great, service was average. I personally wouldn't go back or recommend this."}
{"text":"Everything was good but please keep in mind that the portions are too little. All in all very good"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night after attending the One of A Kind Christmas 2016 show.  My friends and I wanted to get some grub after stopping by the teddy cafe and figured we'd just opt for a place that was close by (instead of going to another Thai restaurant that was a little bit further away).  We were seated pretty quickly and were given menus to go over.  I ordered a lamb stir fry and my friends got red curry and pad thai.  I didn't really think much about how the food looked but the dish I got tasted a little bit bland.  Flavour-wise, it paled in comparison to other Thai places in the city.  I'd say come here for a quick bite if you don't have any other options, but maybe go down the street if you want something better."}
{"text":"So. This place has been on mine and my friend's mind for quite some time but somehow it always slipped away - possibly because of the way it looked from the outside (kinda scary for a Thai place) - but after the last visit it never will.  My expectations are pretty high when it comes to restaurants and in particular Asian ones because I worked in the industry and well...maybe because I am Asian?lol and this place was no exception.  The selection was excellent.  I wish I had SEVERAL stomachs and hours to sit and try everything- which means another few visits will be mandatory. The appetizer platter was AWESOME even though they didn't have the shrimp cold rolls(which for me is a big no-no in a Thai restaurant), the veggie roles were refreshing enough that I forgave them for this grave error.  The food was SO GOOD(I wish I could bold and underline this). I really don't know how it happened but I ate and ate and there were still more to eat until my tummy said it was done and then suddenly, there was none to eat. The service was timely and quick - I'm not going to say that they were a friendly bunch, because they didn't really say very much to build rapport or anything exciting like that. But I appreciated that my water was constantly filled and when I was done eating the plates magically disappeared almost immediately and was replaces with some other yummy goodness.  Most importantly, I can handle the chili rating at this place so some of my pride regarding the ability to digest spicy food were also restored :D Another interesting happenstance was that, I never EVER get itis from having Asian food and that had happened here. I had to sit and let it all settle before I could muster the courage to get up and walk away - good food should never be wasted.   Ambiance wise, I was rather fond of the chandeliers and the dim lighting but mostly the quiet  noise of people talking without radio blaring or some other noise - I could actually have a private or a rather loud conversation without feeling obnoxious. There were was just enough spaces between tables that I may have a super private conversation, which seem to be a rare thing these days, everyone's trying to pack as many bodies as possible per sqft.  Yup I'm happy. I dunno why I didn't go there earlier."}
{"text":"The good: ambiance, quick and friendly service, location.   We ordered the red curry and a phad thai. The curry sauce was really good- creamy and flavorful, but i'm not sure the chicken was \"real\"...if you know what I mean...reconstituted?   The phad thai was disappointing. I remember having the phad thai here a few years ago and loving it- so I was excited to have it again-but this time it  was dry, boring and completely MEH.   Maybe due to high volumes at lunch they pre-make it?   Not in a huge hurry to go back, and my phad thai craving remains!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for dinner with a guest and was recommended the pad thai by our waiter. I normally love pad thai but I was disappointed with the pad thai I received. It was way too ketchup tasting and bright red in colour. If that is Golden Thai's signature dish then I'd hate to see the other dishes. For $13 it was definitely not worth it. I do like the decor here though. Service was not that great despite the fact that it wasn't very busy. Our server didn't refill our waters til the end and we had to wait 10min before he took our dishes away and brought the bill."}
{"text":"Came in to try the lunch special and it was actually very good! I had the lime leaf beef and the 'butterfly shrimp' -- yep, those quotation marks were on purpose.. The shrimp had these wontons stuck through them like butterfly wings and I thought that was pretty cool. The rice and noodles underneath were tasty and pretty great. Buddy had the kale salad with tempeh on it and it looked great as well. Cloase to work and I'll totally be back..."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. At golden thai, you get great taste at great value, what more could you ask for in expensive Toronto? I trekked here with a coworker based on her glowing review of this resto. I ordered the lunch special with butterfly shrimp (let me warn you, the butterfly part is a real gimmick) and it comes with a generous plate of noodles, fried rice, pickled vegetables, one springroll and shrimp. I was a bit disappointed by the \"butterfly\" part but once I started digging in, I was completely overwhelmed and impressed by the flavour and perfection cooked into each mini dish. I do love that you get to try a little bit of everything.  The obvious drink of choice would be a tall glass of Thai-Style Iced Tea. Unfortunately, the iced tea fell short of my expectations. It was extremely fragrant and I felt that the actual taste of tea got lost in all the perfume. Definitely not my cup of tea.   That being said, I will return for some green thai curry or pad thai, only I wish it was closer to where I work."}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. The Pad Thai had a weird aftertaste, and the two different curry dishes accompanying it tasted a little too similar for my liking. The coconut ice cream could have been made with sour milk, but the coconut curry soup was very good, basically canceling each other out.   I'd say skip this one. There's much better Thai elsewhere in the city."}
{"text":"It's like Thai Express on a plate for 3x the price. Place itself is alright but honestly the food and drink is not great. Ordered a Thai Iced Tea cocktail and it came with 2 ice cubes that melted in a minute so it was a warm cocktail...staff was friendly but definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery online to my hotel and I was able to track the timeline of when I could expect it. The prices were pretty standard but the portions were definitely large or so it seemed in the Togo containers. What cracked me up was the food delivery guy who showed up in short shorts and roller blades while there was snow on the ground and just above freezing. His reasoning was because pants get in the way. True that. If I'm in the area again I'd like to eat at the restaurant and try other dishes!"}
{"text":"I don't think i've ever been really disappointed in a restaurant serving thai cuisine, and i don't frequent them that often, so take these four stars with that context.  I thoroughly enjoyed our recent dinner at Golden Thai.  We split the pad thai and pork satay (i know - super adventurous) but both were well prepared and the sauces carried each of the dishes.  Service was quick and friendly - we had probably the most low key waiter i have ever seen: \"what's going on over here\" was his standard check-in phrase.  I liked him - although i could see others finding it off-putting of unprofessional - i would rather someone not try to put on an overly-fake pretense.  Very satisfying dinner overall."}
{"text":"4.5 stars Why? The food here is simply amazing. Get the tamarind version phad thai. Yes, that is how they spell it on their menu; phad. The classic is tomato paste - ewwwwwwwwwwwwww. The beef basil was also delic and overall the food quality is very high. Portion size was a bit small but fair overall.   The atmosphere is very lively and was quite packed on the night I went. Location is a bit out of the way compared to main stream downtown but I would venture to this area just to eat the phad thai again. 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Ambience and service were good, and it wasn't very busy.  Bathroom was a bit below expectation.  The food was good and came at a timely manner.  Would recommend.  The entrance to the restaurant is on Church street, so don't be like me and walk around the entire building to find the door when it was so obvious."}
{"text":"This place has been around forevs.  Don't expect beyond the beyond delicious thai food - hello, that's what Khao San Road is for. This place is fine. The decor is lovely, uber ethnic. Service was great, drinks were awesome and the food was fine. I had the shrimp chips to start, then some communal veggie spring rolls and the golden thai rice (shrimp and chicken) for dinner. I think that was my fatal flaw, the rice was nothing to write home about. The rice comes super spicy, so the cooks made mine mild with spicy chillies on the side. Thoughtful, but my rice was definitely missing something. Friends had the curries and the pad thai - I had dinner envy."}
{"text":"Had the Green Curry and Tom Yum soup ... they did it really well, one of the best Thai places I've been to.  Service was very good too."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a Thursday evening. Note that if you're here for dinner, there's a parking lot right across the restaurant, a couple buildings down going south on Church Street, where parking is $4.00 after 4:00 PM (as of the date of this review).  We ordered the Phad Thai (Tamarind flavour) and the Mussaman Beef Curry, with an order of Thai Ice Tea. Overall, a pretty delicious meal. We really enjoyed the beef curry - really unique flavour. Sweet, spicy, earthy, with a tinge of tanginess. The meat was also very tender. Coupled with rice, it was definitely a delicious combination.   Our only minor issue was that, proportionate to the price (average $11-$12 per order), the portion size was a bit small, compared to other restaurants for similar dishes (i.e. the Phad Thai portion here is, more or less, half the size of pad thai dishes at other Thai establishments in the city).   Overall, a pretty delicious meal (though, because of portion size, we were hungry an hour later). Service was excellent, the atmosphere is classy, and great for group dinners.   For two people, with tax, and tip, our total came to a little less than $34.00."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant out one night and was surprised by the food, atmosphere and staff. However my only complaint would be the smaller than expected portion sizes. For dishes that average between the $11-$12 range, it didn't make sense that the portions size are significantly smaller than your typical thai restaurant Downtown, Toronto."}
{"text":"We have been going to this place for maybe 15-20 years.   It really is consistently delicious.  Golden Thai has wonderful soup,  spring rolls, shrimp crackers,  chicken satay, coconut shrimp,  cashew chicken to name some dishes we order regularly.  We have tried other Thai restaurants around town and keep coming back here.  I have tried Mengrai Thai,  it is good but not as good I have to say.  Their starters like Morning Glory,  are fantastic but their satay isn't very good and their curries I find way too creamy.  So we love Golden Thai,   they also always have great service too."}
{"text":"There's not much more that needs to be said about this place. The food is good, definitely one of the better Thai places in the city. Decor is charming and pleasant. Service is courteous.  I came by on a Wednesday night for dinner (around 6:30 PM). There was one large group and a few other tables but apart from that, the restaurant wasn't overly crowded or anything (maybe about half full). I opted for the pad thai. It was good, but maybe I walked in with unrealistic expectations, so I wasn't quite blown away by it. My friends opted for an eggplant dish and a curry. I tried a bit of both and found them to be delicious. The Thai-style iced tea is also a very neat, refreshing beverage."}
{"text":"Recently returned for a group event.  Not only did everything go perfectly but they brought a cake cutter for a brought-in cake.  Fed 9 people for $200!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal! This rating comes from a serious Thai food fan. We had the pork Phuket noodle soup as well as the chicken coconut Tom kha gai. Delish. We paired it with a spicy Thai martini and a couple of Singha beers. This place needs to be experienced and enjoyed by all."}
{"text":"It's all about the ginger fish! A 25 min wait but well worth it and never disappointing. Everything I've had in my countless visits in this Toronto staple makes me happy"}
{"text":"Best authentic thai food in Toronto.   Service is even better  Get the fried bananas for dessert!"}
{"text":"A place of pure quality! Dishes of awesome, layered flavour, and just some of the friendliest staff in town! The menu is grand, but if you want to just try em out, do the lunch specials! Don't be shy!"}
{"text":"This is my go to lunch place for casual business lunches. The staff are great and food comes out fresh and fast! Not only that, there are lots of vegan options and the staff know what vegan means.   The dish I always order is the (vegetarian) Golden Thai tofu (which is sort of like a super flavourful fried tofu salad with tomatoes, onion, cucumber, cilantro in a delicious Thai dressing) and a side of rice.  Everyone I've taken here just loves it.  Note: One step at door, washrooms on same floor."}
{"text":"We had the Som Tum salad and appetizer platter. Both were fresh and tasty. The cocktails were too sweet for our tastes. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I would recommend Thai Fantasy on Yonge Street if you guys really wanna get some Thai food"}
{"text":"Pad Thai and Green Curry Chicken are a can't miss.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was reasonable, but not as good as I'm used to. If I had received this meal ten years ago, I would have given this restaurant a 4 or even a 5, but I feel some really amazing new Thai restaurants in the city, in particular Papaya on Yonge Street near Wellesley, and especially the two locations of Sukhothai (one on Wellington and the other on Parliament), have really, really raised the bar.  The decor and service at Golden Thai was superb, but given the competition i mentioned, I probably won't return."}
{"text":"We ordered the hot and sour soup, green coconut curry chicken, and red curry chicken. We felt the food items were all mediocre for the price we paid and the small portions. I've been here before and had the same sentiment. With other thai restaurants around the corner like sukkothai, I don't think we will come back here. Sorry.   Good: Service. The staff were friendly and attentive. The atmosphere inside was good and beautifully decorated."}
{"text":"Pros: Plenty of lunch options Dishes done pretty well  Cons: Portions could be better  I was off on a Monday and decided to take my GF out to lunch here.  I have passed by Golden Thai on numerous occasions.  It always looks like a warehouse from the outside in my opinion.  However, when we walked in, the decor was very well done.  It's also a lot bigger than I thought.  There are plenty of tables here.  You shouldn't have to wait too long for a seat.  Coming here for lunch, i also got to see their lunch menu.  You can create your own lunch special here which was nice.  you choose from 8 different items.  You can up to 3 choices and prices vary depending on how many you choose.  All items come with fried rice and noodles.  There are also about 10 other set dishes you can choose from.  Their main menu consists of many categories to choose from.  It's one of the bigger menus at a Thai restaurant.  They focus more on actual dishes than the noodles and rice ones.  My GF ordered the basil beef lunch special and I got a lamb curry from the main menu. The dishes come out pretty quickly which is good when you're on the clock.  My GF said her basil beef was very well done.  The rice and noodles were OK, what you expect for a lunch special.  My GF says there's a hint of spice in the rice as well.  My curry was very well done.  The curry itself has a nice blend of spices in it.  The lamb pieces were very tender.  The dishes here are overall pretty well done.  My gripe is with the portion size.  They could be better here.  I was also charged a bowl of rice to go with my curry.  Maybe it's just me, but I hate having to pay for rice when I order curries.    Based on what I see in pictures, I think I would definitely check this place out again for dinner as well.  My experience here was very pleasant to say the least."}
{"text":"Went there to celebrate a friend's 40th birthday. We started off with ginger tea which tasted great, not too strong.  We had the chicken mushroom soup to start which was excellent. We shared the lunch special which was affordable, tasty & a good portion. It included rice, noodles together and we opted for the green curry, shrimp with wonton and beef. For dessert we had mango & litchi ice cream & deep fried banana. Service was EXCELLENT! Decor is nice.  Convenient location.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food I have ever had in Toronto! The coconut rice taste very good with the green curry. We also ordered the spicy Thai noodles and the texture of the noodles is special I love it!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a weekend. Decor had some nice Thai touches, nothing upscale but felt authentic. I ordered the choose your own items meal and got the pork. (Think it was a Thai spin on sweet and sour?) When it came, I was very surprised by the portion we got, it was really good value for a set down restaurant. I couldn't finish the entire plate. There was a spring roll, stir fried veggies, noodles and rice.  All the food items gave off a food court vibe in terms of presentation and selection, but definitely tasted way better than your average food court. I was so busy eating the sides, I didn't have much time to get to the pork itself. Pork itself was stir fried and wasn't too greasy, but I didn't think it was too memorable. Nothing too mind blowing about the food but I would come back for its value."}
{"text":"This place has some pretty amazing green curry.    After having ventured to Salad King only to find out that it was closed / under renovation, I resorted to my trusty Yelp app on my BlackBerry and lo-behold, Golden Thai came up!  Thank you fellow Yelpers.  Only gripe is that the mango / tofu salad was a bit of a let down but luckily, the basil shrimp and oh-so-delicious green curry chicken saved the day.    The curry was rich, creamy and filled to the brim with chicken - love it.    Try it.  You know you want to."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great Thai place to eat, then this place is tremendous. Reasonable prices, great service and some of the best \"authentic\" Thai I have ever eaten. You will not be disappointed with anything on the entire menu!! I had 2 other guests dine with me for lunch and it was exquisite for all of us!!"}
{"text":"Had the lunch special here with two meats. I got the black bean chicken and the ginger beef. The black bean chicken was good, and moist. The idea of ginger beef sounds great, but the cuts of beef weren't the best, or just weren't handled properly. Like the noodles that came with the meal, and fried rice is... fried rice. Wasn't a huge fan of the spring roll... wouldn't get it again as it didn't have much flavour beyond fried dough. I would eat here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there. I'd recommend the place for lunch over dinner."}
{"text":"I've been here around 4 or 5 times, and each time the service has been consistently polite, albeit restrained. They seem to feel the menu speaks for itself, so there's not a lot of discussion. Today I ordered the appetizer plate and it was the most disappointing option, but previous visits have been good.  Overall the drawbacks are a shortage of veg and protein portions in favour of massive servings of carbs. I guess this is how they keep the lunch menu prices on the bargain end, and the decor offers its own charm. Still, I'd probably return more if the veg offering was a bit more generous.   Eat BKK is closer to me and I find the food there to be much better, but when I'm downtown, Golden Thai is a worthy option."}
{"text":"Great service and the peanut sauce is delicious. Had the fried banana and coconut ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"went here for dinner.  it was a party of 11.  we pretty much sat there for 30mins before ordering.  it was pretty pack house.  we ordered tons of food, i think maybe close to 20 dishes.  pretty much everyone order 2 dishes.  i had like 3 tiger beers as well.  the bill was around $50 per person for 7 peeps and the other 4 who didnt drink pay 140.  so total was around $490.  tips was already included in the bill.  maybe the bill was inflated by a couple person who order cocktails.... oh yeah, damn 11% tax in canada...  freaking heh...  i think its kinda pricey....  the food was decent.  i guess this is the \"it\" place in toronto.  ive certainly had better thai food in SF and BKK.  nothing special to me.  the service was ok.  it was a busy night, so i guess they are forgiven."}
{"text":"Even though the food tasted good I was very disappointed.  Pad Thai served with a Spring Roll says it all. Definitely NOT authentic Thai food.   Food is whatever-mass-market-wants with a hint of Thai cuisine. They might as well include some sushi dishes there...Very disappointing.  If you don't know much about Asian food you'll probably like it, but if you do you'll probably be disappointed with the mishmash.  Plus, they can't adjust the heat. I wonder if everything is already pre-cooked and re-heated.  Thai food is so awesome. This place was a let down unfortunately."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to me, and while I was a bit sceptical at first, I must admit it is quite delish.  It is the standard faire when it comes to pricing... It was around $18 for a curry, soup, and rice. Not cheap but not expensive either. We tried the green and the red curry and they were amazing! They are perfectly spicy for Canadian standards -- especially the green one. Gives you a runny nose, but isn't too hot. I'd recommend the soups (we trierd the mushroom one). It was delicious but maybe a tad too salty. Probably the mixture of veggies and spices.  The ambiance was quite nice -- lots of Thai sculptures, some random chandeliers placed strategically. Not sure how good it would be for larger groups - most of the tables were for four to five people. It got a bit dark as the evening progressed and lightning was rather moody. I would have liked it a bit brighter but alas ...  Though the location is somewhat random (not much going around in that part of Church), the food is well worth the visit. Nom. Still panting heavily after having so much food."}
{"text":"Very solid Thai food. Best dishes were green curry, coconut ice cream and sticky rice with mango.  Prices reasonable though rice is a la carte. Still reasonably priced overall and excellent service."}
{"text":"This place is great but I would recommend walking west on Richmond to Mengrai Gourmet Thai for the truly best Thai in the city.   Everything Golden does well (service, creative preparation, freshness, selection) Mengrai does just a bit better.  I've had one disappointing Mango salad (it wasn't all fresh or properly sliced) here but after several meals I can say that they tend to do everything well.  I like the decor but I find the room a bit on the large and loud side most of the time.  That said, they are usually quite fast with service, and they take care with all of their dishes (90% of the time)."}
{"text":"So cheap for the value, and so good on the food.   Their desserts are also really good (homemade ice creams with unique fruits).  Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"A serious let down from a place that's supposedly one of the best Thai restaurants in the city. I visited Golden Thai on a Saturday afternoon a few weeks ago. It was completely empty - usually a bad sign - but I forged ahead because I've heard only good things about the place. I should have listened to my gut. The food wasn't awful, but it wasn't that great either and it is overpriced.  We were doing the vegetarian thing that day and we went for: Vegetarian Platter for Two ($18.95 or $9.94 for one person), Thai Vegetable Soup ($6.45), and Golden Thai Tofu ($7.95) with Steamed Rice ($2). To be honest, the food was so boring and lacklustre I can't even remember anything intelligent to say about it. I will say that I was really disappointed by the lack of wonderful flavour and fragrance that I usually expect in Thai food. Overall, my experience was on par with Spring Rolls - not a good sign.  Maybe I ordered the wrong things, maybe their meat options are better than the veggy ones, but I certainly won't be back to check. With the superb Mengrai Thai (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/mengrai-gourmet-thai-toronto) only a short walk away I don't know why anyone would eat at Golden Thai."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really nice and the wait staff are fast and friendly.   The food is amazing! I usually get the green chicken curry, coconut shrimp, spicy calamari and the shrimp lemongrass soup (all AMAZING). Keep in mind I'm splitting all of this food with other people... Neither my stomach or wallet is a bottomless pit. *sigh*  I definitely recommend giving this place a go! You won't be disappointed. In the case that you are disappointed, well, you just have bad taste, I'm sorry."}
{"text":"A local suggested this place so we decided to try it out.  It was probably one of the nicest decorated Thai places that I've been to I really liked the atmosphere.  It was dimly lit and the perfect place for a cozy romantic evening.  I started with the spring rolls which to my surprise were very nicely seasoned.  I've never had a spring roll with so much flavor most of they are just above bland then you dip them in duck sauce to make them into something more, but these could stand by themselves.  For dinner I had the pad Thai which was good they had three different sauce options classic, tamarind, or curry.  I went with the classic not realizing that what I usually get at home is the tamarind version.  The classic had more of a red color to it and the tamarind had more of a soy sauce color to it.  I liked the tamarind sauce better but I ate the classic.  I would definitely come back here and get the tamarind pad Thai."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal last week.  Terrific service, great food, and decent prices!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"You know you're about to enjoy a great meal when a random Toronto resident passing by on a bike commands, \"GO INTO THE THAI PLACE! IT'S REALLY GOOD!\" Our stomachs growling and minds open, my boyfriend and I readily accepted the Mystery Biker's advice and found ourselves in a beautifully decorated restaurant.  From the cool vegetarian rolls, to the wok sautéed veggies, to the Golden Chicken, to a mango cocktail, everything was totally delicious. The waitstaff was also so kind and helpful, making sure to check on us and mindful of any dietary restrictions. If I had more time in Toronto, I would absolutely return -- and maybe even share my meal with the benevolent biker as a thank-you."}
{"text":"Good food and portion size. Had the green curry lunch as takeaway. Good ammounts of meat and vegetables in the curry."}
{"text":"Had lunch there on a weekday recently. The lunch specials are a good deal. Large servings for about $10-12. The green curry chicken was great. However the pad Thai was the ketchup kind. So that was a bit disappointing. I prefer the kind with tamarind. Overall I say it's worth it though. They have one of my favourite red curry in the city. (But that was not part of the lunch special)"}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food. I work in the area so I am no stranger to Golden Thai but it's our go to for lunch events because it is soooo good. The lunch menu, which is ridiculously priced (very cheap for the portion and amazing food you get) is great. You can have a choice of two of the following: green curry chicken, eggplant, butterfly shrimp, tamarind beef, ginger pork, with rice AND noodles, salad, and a spring roll for $9.45! For dessert (if you are not asleep by this time) I highly recommend the crispy banana with rum glaze and a side of coconut ice cream. The atmosphere is very lively but what do you expect from a place that's this great in downtown Toronto. Truly a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Food, service and drinks are not bad and not great.  Overall a normal dining experience.  Seating is pretty nice with Thai decorations.    Menu is vegetarian friendly.  Lots of selection and price point is not high.  It's not a convenient location, drive here is probably the easiest."}
{"text":"Their tamarind pad thai are amazing! must try if you want some good tasting noodles! However the prices are a bit steep. $13 incl tax for one. Portions are sometimes big sometimes smaller"}
{"text":"So so so good, AGAIN!  We're here on business from Atlanta and our dinner was ah-mazing!  This is our 2nd time visiting here, it was spot on!  Food was spicy as we ordered!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It has been years since I came here Wonderful welcome at the door Great setting  Coconut shrimps wonderful and the Tom yam soup yummy And the reason I come here is the picture pad thai"}
{"text":"Great place, clean, good food and even better is the low price!  Love coming here for lunch or dinner after work."}
{"text":"2.8  There is no way I can call this place a \"fine Thai dining restaurant\", sorry.   Decoration is globally OK, but placing here and there some terracota elephant statues does not turn a restaurant into a \"fine\" place! Food has to be much better, refined and tastier than what I had; and tableware should be more elaborated. Service was OK, but not more than that.  good thing is that it is not too pricey."}
{"text":"fairly average thai food. We had the pad thai and basil pork and they were good, but not amazing. The basil pork came with a lot more green bell peppers than pork. i liked the fact that there was a good potion of vegetables. their cocktails are expensive and small in size, but really good."}
{"text":"Have always enjoyed this restaurant.  Just ordered the South Pacific (?) dinner for two.  Service was fast; food was good and an excellent mix.  Accessible at all levels."}
{"text":"best coconut thai chicken soup in the world..period... I have been to Thailand 10+ times and had thai food at both high- and low end places across the world. This soup is fantastic! All food is in general very good and very reasonably priced. Venue is a bit plain and their deserts should be better. I normally have their spicy beef salad (awesome), cold vegetable rolls (pretty awesome as well), but find most of the food well above average across the board. Service is decent, frankly I don't go there to be impressed by it and they havent done anything to screw things up on any of my numerous visits."}
{"text":"Initial visit, I may have given it a 3 or 4. Over a period of time, I've become quite fond of the place. I'm not the biggest fan of places like Khao San Road and Sukho Thai, which not only lack ambience and service, but think pouring in the grease and being heavy handed with spices makes the food delicious.  This is more your long-term, go-to quiet place, where you can go with family, friends and colleagues. Good service, good alcohol and good food.  Try the coconut chicken soup and you won't be disaapointed - we love this one. I like their spicy fried calamari, penang curry and banana dessert too. Does it come cheap? No. But if you want everything - good atmosphere, service and food - this has the best balance for Thai food that I've seen in Toronto yet.  For cheaper and more casual Thai dining, I have another favourite up North."}
{"text":"Food was spicy. Not really flavorful. The service was excellent however!"}
{"text":"Meh.. there's better Thai food for cheaper elsewhere"}
{"text":"Not one of the popular Thai places in town, and I don't understand why. The decor is very classy and very Thai-style. The space itself is spacious and you feel like you have some privacy, which is rare downtown. In terms of the food, started off with the the tom yum soup, satay skewers, and the lychee mango salad. The appetizers were tasty but my favourite dishes were the entrees.   The Pad Thai is amazing - had the tamarind version and it tastes like how a good pad Thai should be tasting (aka not made with ketchup). Sweet with a little bit of a kick. It also comes in a classic version and a curry version - I'd stick to the tamarind since it taste so perfect already.  The green curry was creamy with the right amount of spice. It's so important to me to emphasize the fact that the curry wasn't watery. It's definitely a way to judge whether the restaurant can do Thai food right. The bowl of curry is on the smaller side, so you end up with more rice than curry since the rice (ordered separately) comes in a HUGE salad-sized bowl.  Also ordered the Thai iced tea, which tasted like it was made with jasmine tea rather than Thai tea. So it definitely tasted different - a little reminiscent of bubble tea."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place I will start with the Decor; beautiful, feels like you're in Thailand, really great place to go to on a romantic date. Starting backwards, the dessert ~ rum drenched flaming bananas and a perfect espresso... Even though I was stuffed this dessert was simply delicious! The brass monkey, absolutely yummy and strong too, I'm not even a cocktail drinker but I'd go back for it!!  My rice noodle salad with warm mushrooms, coriander and prawns  Offered a satisfying array of spectacular flavors!!  Veggie Spring rolls were non-greasy with the best dipping sauce ever. They even gave me some sauce to take home, very generous.  I didn't order the pad Thai but I tried some and it was as good as pad Thai could possibly be. Servers were attentive and I plan to go back again and again and again :)"}
{"text":"This is such a lovely restaurant.  I have been here over the years and just love coming back.  I especially love the Thai Green Curry.  It is unlike anything I have had elsewhere.  It is fragrant, tender and delicious.  The service is lovely.  The lovely gentleman who served us told us how they make my favourite dish from scratch. The décor is wonderful with carvings and paintings.  So nice!  It has been consistent in service and quality for years!  LOVE it!  Perfect for lunch, dinner, date night or with friends.  The only problem?  I need to try more things on the menu and struggle to do so because I love my favourite dishes so much!"}
{"text":"The service was superb but :((  Firstly I try never to give a one star however when one does not conform to the food and taste of its advertised restaurant I have no choice. This restaurant does not serve Thai food. It may look Thai and even have Thai servers but their Pad Thai, green xurry, red curry was devoid of any Thai taste or spices. It is a great disappointment to have come to a beautiful restaurant which does not give any hint of Thai experience in its food.    I mean it there was no nada nought hint of Thai in their food.  Red curry and green curry tasted like they were brought  in from dinner boxes found in your local supermarket.  I dare say super market bought woukd have tasted better.  The apptizers is fresh but again other than a fry up the chutneys or dipping sauce again is devoid of anything resembling Thai.  Not to sound racist but my foreign friend said \" this is for the white people \" not for thise who know Thai food. That is wrong of him to say but i got his drift.    The pad thai was shamelessly noodles in a slight sugary sweetish mixup of nothingness. Totally bland.  The Thai tea and coffee is watery and again was coffee that i woild serve to anyone.   I and 4 of my friends who love Thai cuiskne were disappointed. Not ever going to come back to nor recommended."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for a romantic dinner when I went to visit him in Toronto. We got the holiday special, which was several courses of very delicious Thai food. The service was prompt and friendly.  While the pad thai that came with the special was nothing to write home about, the coconut and chicken soup was a life-changing experience. You know the soup is good when you have to stop yourself from slurping it up while on a date.  I also loved the mango salad which was tart and delicious.   The flaming banana dessert was also a kick, although a little too rummy."}
{"text":"What can I not say? WOW!!! I love this place! I always drive by it and wanted to try and finally couple months back I did. Ambience is very nice with nice decor. Food was fantastic. Nothing we tried that we did not like. We ordered the appetizer platter to share and the shrimps were bursting with lemongrass flavouring. Yum! Probably my fav that night. The pad Thai was traditional with that slight sweet yet sour taste but certainly not ketchup-y like some pseudo Thai places around.  Red curry was very good, lots of flavour all around.  Best part was our waiter. He was very busy yet still managed to keep an eye on a table for two compared to his other tables which had more in the party. He kept our water glasses filled at all times and if there were any questions or what not, he was on top of it. Best example of what a wait service experience should be at any establishment. I forget his name but he was a taller slim gentleman.  Thank you for a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed with the food portion regardless of the great taste. We had a pineapple and chiken fried rice and basil beef (which had more basil and bell pepper than beef) The food were excellent but the portion really need some improvement. For dessert we had the classif mango sticky rice. The rice is delicious with the coconut milk flavor and the mango is great too, not like many other restaurants that have super sweet mango. I could not complain about the service, given that at 9:30 at night the restaurant was still filled with customers. I love the atmosphere as it felt like I am actually eating in a Thai restaurant. Overall I will give it a 7.7/10, just because the food portion was quite embarassing."}
{"text":"The place has been there as long as I can remember and has seen the neighbourhood around it change from a sketchy area to the more fashionable address it has become. Located on a corner with large gorgeous single paned windows from a bygone era it looks out on both Richmond and Church Street. There are a host of tables with white tablecloths set into a deep, luxurious decor that is flecked with lots of sparkle from chandeliers and the hints of gold throughout the Thai inspired walls and ceilings. It is a beautiful space and we arrived early enough to snag a table without a reservation. The menu features a host of Thai dishes with a good selection of appetizers. We opted for some shrimp crackers and peanut sauce to start because I was so hungry. The service was impeccable, attentive and always with a smile. All the serving staff, were men and were as beautiful as the decor. Mr.T ordered a couple of appetizers, some cold rolls and coconut shrimp which were delicious. For mains we ordered a beef dish, the vegetarian pad thai and the spicy eggplant and some rice. The dishes were beautiful and delicious."}
{"text":"Second best Thai place in the city but the best for atmosphere and ambiance.  A lot of fantastic vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Had  a fantastic birthday dinner here last night.  Not crowded, but busy enough.  Nice atmosphere, and fantastic service.  Had rolls, hot and sour soup (very nice), basil beef and ginger chicken.  Great food all around, completely satisfied.  Will definitely return soon!"}
{"text":"Poor service - there was only 4 tables (include my party of 6) out of the 20+ tables, had no choice because 2 other Thai restaurants nearby are fully booked; however the server was still rushing us, clearing dishes before we are done eating:  very mediocre food... not authentic at all.  I had better pad Thai from the food court."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday with some friends. We were immediately greeted by a nice, older Asian lady who sat us at our table.   The menu is pretty extensive with lots of different, delicious sounding options. We opted for the cool rolls, beef skewers with peanut sauce, ginger chicken, pad Thai and golden Thai shrimp. All were delicious, fresh and very flavourful.   The serving sizes could be a tad bit bigger, but the great taste makes up for it. I would definitely return for some more!   Tips for your visit. They unfortunately do not split bills. They have great options for vegetarians and take the food handling and preparation very serious when dealing with allergies.   4/5 for me!"}
{"text":"A Thai in the sky?!?!   My friends and I went there last Saturday and had a good meal. Nice ambiance, exotic drinks, great food.... Cant complaint!!  Cocktails like Pataya Payaya and monzoon dont really appeal to me but some of us had them and thought they were quite good.  Ordered the mango and lychee salad (sounds better than it tasted), lamb, chicken and pork satay (yumz) and shrimp lemon grass soup (ordinary).   Then we ordered golden thai fried rice (delicious), pad thai (tasted like ketchup), green curry pork (not bad), steak (only had 1 piece) and the tamarind scallops (delightful) shared everything à la Chinese style so we get a taste of everything.  To wrap up the lovely evening, we had blazing bananas and mango sticky rice!!! The blazing part was cute but the banana was so soaked in wine and mushy, it was kinda gross... I much prefer the mango sticky rice (yumza!)"}
{"text":"I was surprisingly impressed with this restaurant. Hot fresh authentic Thai food. I tried the pad Thai and green chicken curry and it was delicious. Great service and no crowding and line ups compared to San Khao rd."}
{"text":"On vacation, Thai food was a must. I came here on a walk from my hotel, and had no idea what to expect, other than the little hotel magazine.   We came in and were quickly seated without reservation on a Saturday night around 7. The restaurant was full, but still had room. We ordered our meals, I got the Thai spicy noodles while my boyfriend got something I don't remember. He got the Singha (Thai beer) and I got Thai iced coffee. I tried the beer and liked it and some of his dinner, and like that too, but with no name this is no help. My meal had 2 stars, so the menu called it a spicy dinner. I would have to agree with the menu, as my nose was running plenty due to the amount of spice in my dinner. This is by no means a problem, as this just means I'm enjoying my meal. I stole some steamed rice from my boyfriend's plate to counter the spice. I would have ordered a side of steamed rice, but wasn't sure how much would come out with it.   The food was great, and service was very quick as well, and I look forward to come back again!"}
