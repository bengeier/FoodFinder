{"text":"Always a wonderful experience. Great food, great service, reasonable prices for the quality of food.  Don't let the \"pool hall\" genre fool you. The sauce for the veal piccata is sublime! My family's favourite restaurant. No matter how many people are at your table, they will all really like their food and that's rare."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious!  I've been going to Gabriel's for a few years, since my sister found it and recommended it to me.  The chef there does a great job with pasta sauces.  Their pizza great (I like them all but especially like the Chicken Pesto), and their salads are really good as well (I'm a big fan of Gabriel's Salad).  I have yet to bring anyone to Gabriel's and have them leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"I can never go wrong with Gabriel's. Great spot that I have hosted large buffet parties as well as plated dinner for small groups or couples. Food is incredible and great all-around value. Staff is great and I love coming here.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Nice place for a business lunch meeting. Quiet surroundings and attentive service. There is a wide variety of options on the menu and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Yummmyyyy!  I will go back again and again!  We found this hidden gem (literally!) a few years ago. It has become an easy favorite.  we have hosted parties here, had lunch, dinner, dessert. AMAZING!! The service is awesome.  Owned by a very sweet couple!   I always have their Pollo Involtini. highlyyy reccomend! everyone i have taken here has fallen in love with the food, service, all of it!  Pool tables are a very nice addition. Our friends loved it at our last party.  Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Gabriel's is a local lunch spot close to my office. I ventured over for a department lunch; the restaurant was able to accomodate our large 20+ group.  Service was excellent and the staff were super friendly as well as attentive.  I ordered a full pizza which was more than enough pizza for 2!  The crust was perfect and there was a right balance of toppings to cheese.  Next time, I will order the lunch size pizza portion.  They have an assortment of choices on their lunch menu; all my colleagues enjoyed what they each ordered.  I will definitely be back to try out the rest of their lunch menu!"}
{"text":"I went here with my Co-workers and loved the visit. The restaurant is designed in multiple rooms and has plenty of seating.  They also have pool tables and a great menu selections of all sorts. I went with their Tuscany Pizza, I think it was around $16.75 plus tax.   The pizza comprised of Tomato sauce, grilled wild mushrooms, grilled chicken, roasted red peppers, sprinkled with pesto & topped with goat & mozzarella cheese. The server was nice enough to limit the goat cheese to a minimum as I didn't wanted that a lot. The pizza was huge, tasted great and had plenty of toppings plus the crust was nice as well.  The server was very friendly and the wait for the food was not long."}
{"text":"Our local pub/restaurant.   Play pool, sit at the bar, or eat superbly for a very reasonable price in the dining room. Your choice. Excellent food and a very good wine list.   Chef Bill's pizzas, pastas and meat and fish specials are wonderful.  At least once a week for five years."}
{"text":"Glad we stopped in for a yummy supper.  Lots of open tables on a Thursday evening so that worked out well.  It can be noisy with the pool tables in the other room; however the lady across the room who doesn't understand the concept of an 'indoor voice' over-powered the entire place. On to the good news though, the food and the service.  A great server that was fun and attentive.  The Cowboy steak special was excellent.  The meat was cooked to order, medium rare.  Tender and tasty were the standard.  I had a side of their peppercorn sauce.  It was okay but needed the 'kick' from the fresh ground black pepper to make it peppery. The other dish we had was pickerel which was excellent.  A soft crumbly batter on the outside.  The veggies were among the best we've had.  Tons of sprouts, asparagus, broccoli and endive cooked to perfection.  Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I absolutely loved everything about Gabriel's. Great food, their signature seafood pasta is to die for, with such beautiful presentation! And they can customize your dish exactly to your liking which is nice. My boyfriend loves the veal.   The entire staff was so friendly, welcoming and professional. They have so many great choices on their menu and our waitress always has great recommendations when we can't decide.   I love having a nice place to play billiards after a great meal. Recommended to all my friends and family, hope to host my boyfriends birthday here because they're great for private parties! Can't wait till my next Gabriel's fix!"}
{"text":"I booked Gabriel's Restaurant for my Wedding reception dinner. Sean, Bill, Liz, and Tracy have been wonderful and accomodating. We had our wedding this past weekend, and have been working with the restaurant since February. Everytime I call to ask a question, or add a little detail to the reception, they have always been very helpful over the phone. They have helped tremendously in making the wedding day a wonderful one for us and our guests.  We used the Function menu for bigger parties, and we changed one of the main course choices, and it only took one call, they were very accomodating.  Gabriel's had set up the dining room before the dinner, and they successfully set everything up according to plan. We had given them wedding favors, gift box, centerpieces, and even tablecloths and they handled everything carefully and the tables looked elegant. The guests loved the food, the service, and the over-all experience.  Our guests enjoyed the pool tables area, and played for hours (almost until midnight closing time). They enjoyed the dessert which was fruits with a chocolate fountain! Delicious!  Before the Big Day, me and my husband tried their food and had dinner here. Liz was our server at the time and she was amazing! The steak was one of the best ever, and every food we order has been truly remarkable.  I recommend Gabriel's for dinner, especially for parties! Gabriel's has been booked many times for weddings, and they will surely make it a great experience for you and your guests."}
{"text":"This was a very good lunch. I had a chicken Greek salad & it was ginormous!! Tons of black olives (pits removed), Greek feta, tomatoes, onions. It was delicious. The chicken breast was an entire breast. They didn't cheap out on it at all. My lunch mate had the PEI Garlic Mussels in a red sauce. They were beyond delicious! The garlic burst out with every bite! It's an elegant lunch environment & it appeared well maintained. Bonus...pool tables where u could shoot a leisurely game of pool. So the place is a decent mix of quality food with some great stuff to do. All in...lunch was $55.00 with tip.    The only downfall was the waiter abandoned us when a larger party arrived & we weren't served as promptly as we should have. This is a definite do-over."}
{"text":"Feb 2016 Friends from out of town who appreciate fine food. A meal at Gabriel's which impressed everyone. Veal Saltimbocca was the star, along with the Seafood Pasta and Chicken Dishes. Great décor and top notch service."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful service and ambience. I've been here a few times now and it has been consistently good. Their washrooms are very clean and maintained well. They even have a pool/billiards area in their restaurant / pub. Initially I thought this was just a bar but I was pleasantly taken aback when I walked in. You are guaranteed to always get service with a smile at this place."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost 10 years, and am always impressed by the consistency, charm and comfort of Gabriel's. The service is always friendly, helpful and unobtrusive.   And the food! My favourite is the souvlaki, but the steaks are perfection."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden within a bunch of businesses in the back right off of Mississauga road, but it's not one you want to miss! Besides the amazing service from everyone working there to the atmosphere (super romantic, but is also great for a family dinner as well), and finally - the food! I had the Mushroom Ravioli and (not to sound dramatic, but) it changed my life! Well, my palette. But it was honestly the tastiest pasta I've ever had! I can't wait to come back here again to try something else"}
{"text":"Fancy and swanky and the dishes mostly hearty typical Italian fare.  Good selection. Kinda pricey but good for dates, special occasion or  when you just want to splurge on a pasta   Oh, and they have pool tables!"}
{"text":"I loved going here on Monday. It was quiet but had a great ambiance.  My friend and I played a few rounds of pool before sitting down to have dinner. We were playing for a few minutes before our waiter got our drink orders. I got a glass of whichever Riesling they had. It was lovely.  When we were ready to eat, I ordered the chicken supreme with garlic mashed potatoes, vegetables in a  chardonnay lemon butter sauce. Wow, was the chicken ever piping hot. Almost burnt my mouth (I was very hungry and excited). It was moist and tender with the right amount of grill marks. The chardonnay lemon butter sauce was amazing. It gave the dish a nice zip. My friend got the chicken souvlaki, but they had run out of tzatziki. When his entrée came, our waiter said they did the best they could and still managed to make a very close tzatziki sauce.  We opted to play some more pool while waiting for the bill. This waiting was actually kind of long... Perhaps he didn't want to interrupt us?   I am looking forward to dining here again."}
