{"text":"this is hands down one of the best Indian restaurants I have been to, not to mention vegetarian. food is great, people are great. I will be back."}
{"text":"Good kulcha...chat is good but not as good as the regular thali dishes. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Everything is good about this Indian local food eatery. Taste and Prices are extremely good. Sev Puri is recommended."}
{"text":"I skip breakfast on on weekends so I can come eat here. I'm usually in the area on weekends and absolutely love the food here.   I have tried couple of things on the menu but their chat papri and sev puri are amazing. We always get those two things and maybe try something else.   Had their royal falooda last time and it was really good as well. The decor does need an update (ancient Egypt theme?) but who cares when the food taste so good. The staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"Great Indian breakfast and best value of money.  People are great. Great customer service.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Off late Yelp has failed us.. not this time around :)  Landed in Toronto, hungry and looking for indian food, we looked this place up on google / yelp, its close to the airport, the reviews were decent, we decided to give it a shot.  The food was EXCELLENT!. We ordered Chollay Bhature, and Amritsari Naan, both were reasonably priced, and came with the usual condiments.  The place might give an impression of being dingy and insanitary, but that's just how alot of indian food places look like.  We went back on our way to the airport the day we were flying out as well. This time around just to eat the sweets they had. Bought Kalakand, Laddoo, tried their Gajar Halwa and Gulab Jamun. The GJ's were OUT OF THIS WORLD. I ate more than I should have :D lol.  Go here! you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Must try the amritsari kulcha and dahi puri. They also have a nice selection of sweets too."}
{"text":"The  bf and I stumbled across this sweet shop/ restaurant and wow were we suprised. Neither of us are vegetarian so we thought about going somewhere else but thought why not go have a look. We are so glad we did. The food was delisious, and the familly that runs it are so nice and helpful, it was totally worth the drive.  I would try to tell you what we had but I'm certain that I would get the names wrong. Let me just say for less then twenty dollars we both got stuffed, actually too much for me as I had to save room for the mango lasi. They were the first place to ask me how sweet I wanted it ,medium was perfect, mmmmm mango lasi :)"}
{"text":"The Amritsari Kulcha is to die for! The Onion Kachori is pretty decent as well. You should definitely stop here. Don't go by the looks. The food is the star here as it should be."}
{"text":"Good flavour and great value. Saag Paneer was excellent. I would definitely come here again for a quick casual lunch"}
{"text":"Great food, delightful people, reasonable prices. Doesn't get much better than this!"}
{"text":"This is not Indian chaat - it's downright abysmal!  Also, my god!! The sheer amount of plastic that is used at this place is frightening - wish they cared about the environment a bit more!"}
{"text":"Good customer service and food. We visited this place after seeing some yelp reviews and the place was within 3 miles from our hotel. Ordered vada paav , thali meals and kulfi. Vada paav was so yummy that we took two of them to go as well. The lady in the counter( must be the owner) was so friendly. She figured out that we are not from Canada and she gave us a small sweet box as a compliment and mentioned that it was a gesture to welcome us here in Canada. It was so nice of her."}
{"text":"The place is split into a Chat and faluda house as well as a restaurant. As they are connected by design, there is plenty of seating. The service was nice, friendly and fast.  I only went in for faluda. It average in taste and you can find plenty more places in Brampton for that. My friend ordered their veg thali and he did enjoy that."}
{"text":"Popped in here when I was in the area and craving Indian street food. Did I leave satisfied? Sure. Would I came back? Probably not.   We ordered the samosa dhokla chaat, chole bhatura, and raj kachori. The dhokla in the samosa chaat made it sort of soggy, and their chutneys were way too sweet and had ketchup too I think. Samosa chaat needs to have masala and spice to taste good! The chole bhatura was alright, but I just wish they served more chole rather than yogurt and stuff on the side. The bhatura was also a bit too oily, so we had to keep blotting away the excess oil. Finally, the raj kachori was nothing special. Again the sweet sauces were just odd.   Overall, I guess the food was alright but nothing special and not the best chaat I've had."}
{"text":"I'm glad that I found this place on Yelp! We ordered aloo chana chaat, Pav bhaaji and sev puri. Aloo chana chaat is amazing. Sev puri was okay and Pav bhaaji was yummy! I'll surely visit as soon as possible and try some more yummy items!"}
{"text":"I am giving 5 stars based on their sweet called Kalakand.  Ohhhhhh man oh man doesn't it melts in your mouth. Yummm"}
{"text":"Ended up here by chance.  The good: - you see what you will get - all vegetarian, very tasty - food is fantastic - very reasonably priced. Tali less than $7 - very friendly owner  The bad: - difficult to see from the road - can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"The place is an excellent place is you really like Indian food. They specialize in a type of Indian snack called Chat , which is a plate of savoury snacks, typically served at road-side tracks from stalls or carts in India and the rest of South Asia.  This restaurant makes excellent food, the people who work here are friendly, and make sure you enjoy your food, the food is made with love and care which makes it even a better experience. It's the type of place you wouldn't mind going to often just for a snack, or to sit down and have a meal with your family.  Definitely check it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Ok so chaat is from North India. Specifically Delhi. Any chat in Delhi is awesome.   This is the closest I've had in Canada. Is it as good as Delhi chaat, definitely not, it can't be never will.   Is it the best chat I've had in Canada, definitely.   We ordered paani Puri, papri chaat, tikki chhole, amritsari kulcha, Rose soda, and nimbu pani. Everything was tantalising and mouth watering. It's spicy but ooh soooooo good.   Highly recommended the kulcha."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good for the price... had amazing chat n Thai with mango lassi for just around $15... definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service. The menu was easy to read with digital photos. Thanks! I'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"If you want to have some Indian fast food this place is good. Their paani puri water has good flavour. Quick service and delicious food. Was not too impressed with chaat papri, but Amritsari Kulcha was delicious. You get a kulcha with 3 dishes, yogurt and some salad.  Overall a good place if you wanna relish some Indian food."}
{"text":"Stepped in for a quick lunch during work and loved it! Don't come here if you're looking for anything remotely upscale. The plates are plastic, the washroom is... well... at least there is one, and it's in the corner of a plaza you would never normally see. But the food was pretty good! Shared the Pani Puri and Channa Batura with a friend. The pani puri was good, but that's not too hard to mess up. The batura was really soft, very fluffy, and delicious. The channa was good too, but not the best I've had. The service was fast. We were in and out of there in 20 mins!  I also bought some of the sweets, and they were well made as well.  Overall, amazing value for your money, quick service, and very satisfying :)  Go there!"}
{"text":"I have found a gem.  nice small restaurant, food and the people behind the counter are top notch.  I took whole bunch of food for take out, gentleman behind the counter gave me complimentary sweets A+."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly staff at the counter. Ordered pav bhaji, wada pav, vegetable manchurian, and noodles and the food was delicious! They even gave us a box of sweets since it was our first time there!"}
{"text":"I am here in Toronto just for work. I had to try out Indian food, after consideration and yelp reviews i thought to give this place a try. Location: This is a small restaurant located in a strip mall with other Canadian-Indian owned businesses. Food: I ordered Aloo Poori and Pani Puri, what can I say they were spot-on. As authentic as the real thing. The only critic I would have is the seating area is very small, people have to wait for the table. Owner of this business is very nice and kind, he gave me a box of sweets just because I visited this place first time. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Easily one of the tastiest Indian foods I've had.    What's good: the taste and freshness of the food. Super friendly and courteous staff.  The quantity and prices are not somethin to beat. The stuffed naan (Amritsari kulcha) was absolutely delicious as was the Chat Papri which came recommend by the staff. Very fresh.   What's there to work on? The food was slightly over salted. Rice wasn't cooked properly. Gordon Ramsay would've been furious. Tiny outdated interior. About 20 years outta date.   All in all, great discovery via the yelpers. Def go there again!"}
{"text":"For cheap vegetarian Indian food it was great and amazing value. We had 2 heavy dishes and had no idea what to order so the owner just made us up 2 dinner meals and it was great! Super cheap total for 2 meals was $12.  Its like going into another country in there but such an amazing authentic experience. The owners were so sweet and helpful, even though there was a language barrier. Reminds me of Futures on bloor with an Indian twist."}
{"text":"Chat Hut is located just North of the International Centre, along a strip of Airport Rd. which has quite a few 2-storey buildings with primarily Indian take-out restaurants all along side of the street.  (Honestly, I don't know how all these places stay afloat because they seem to offer similar food items and they're right next to each other.)  Anyway, stopped by this place based on Yelp reviews.  Otherwise, Chat Hut could be interchangeable with one of the other units offering Indian fast food.  Out of all the things that I tried, my favourite was the Pav Bhaji.  Pav/Pao (bread) tasted like a straight up, toasted hamburger bun with garlic butter spread on top.  Although I liked the mix of spices in the Bhaji, my Indian friend said that it didn't taste authentic.  Chat Papri ($4.99) was alright, but not the best that I've tasted.  Food was served on plastic, disposable dishes and styro cups.  Hallway leading to washroom was jammed with boxes of supplies which leads me to believe the restaurant wasn't the cleanest."}
{"text":"This place is a gem hidden off the beaten path. Haven't tried their sweets but their chaat is some of the best I've had! Service is astoundingly fast and friendly, the meal is a great value, and the food...my goodness the food. Their chana masala is possibly the best I've ever had (in India and Canada alike). Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great place for sev puri , pav bhaji, raj kachori. Loved the faluda drink. Wish they would keep the seating area cleaner though. Will go back."}
{"text":"My family came from Florida, and I took them here. We were a group of 6. Chat Hut is by far one of the best places to get Indian street food in the GTA.   We ordered the Chat Papri, Sev Puri and Pani Puri and it was so delicious we had to get another plate. For dessert, we each had the Kulfi Faluda. These dishes are so good it's hard to share; I would recommend getting your own plate.   The prices are reasonable - highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I visited Chat Hut a few weeks ago as I saw it had good reviews. Stepping into the small waiting area, I chose to get the channa rice and garlic naan to go. I also a few pieces of barfi to my meal.  Once I arrived back at my office and dug into the food, I was disappointed to say the least. While a decent sized portion for the price, there was absolutely no flavour. Whether the sauce was too watered down or they went to light on the masalas... honestly, it wasn't good. The garlic naan was store bought and did not have actual garlic on it, but rather a thick coating of garlic powder. Really gross.  The only redeeming factor was the small box of barfi I bought. They were delicious. Seemed fresh enough. Though, not enough to encourage a return visit from me."}
{"text":"Mmmm Indian food for lunch. This place is a family owned restaurant that prides itself on authentic Indian punjabi food. It's a little place with 6 tables big enough for families.  My Indian friends say that the 'chat' is the best in Toronto, super fresh but really I don't know as my mouth and taste buds are exploding with favors."}
{"text":"Happened to run across this little gem of a restaurant. The food quality was amazing and I felt like I was eating at a five star restaurant. The owner of the restaurant guided us as to what we should order and we cleared out our plates! He even gave us a complimentary box of sweets to welcome us to Canada! We will definite visit again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Best chat in Toronto. Amritsari kulcha and sav Puri unbeatable. Good service. Enjoyed a lot"}
