{"text":"Very mediocre for the price.  The filet mignon is OK, everything else is not very good.  The only redeeming quality about this restaurant is the atmosphere.  They definitely need to update their 1950s era menu and their wait staff is neither friendly or helpful.  Honestly, the food is better at every other steakhouse I've ever been to, even boring chains."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in for dinner. And we got lucky and were seated in a private corner next to a window with a scenic view! The food was so freshly made and we greatly enjoyed our meals. We will definitely return again!! It was fun watching the wildlife outside as well"}
{"text":"Unbelievable! We arrived at 3 pm on March 17, 2013 (St. Patrick's day). There may have been a dozen customers in the entire restaurant. We sat in the bar so we could eat and drink and watch the OSU basketball game.  When we showed them we had a $40 Groupon - we were told we had to move 25 feet away to another table away from the television. They would not honor the coupon if we ate in the bar.  WE WERE THE ONLY CUSTOMERS sitting at any of the tables in the bar.  There were only a dozen people in the entire restaurant. We moved. We spent $100 for lunch. We won't go back."}
{"text":"My husband made reservations for us to go here on our wedding anniversary. At the time, Yelp and their other sites on TripAdvisor, etc., said \"yes\" to the wheelchair accessible option. When we arrived, there was no ramp, and they said they could perhaps get busboys to lift him inside (which is obviously impossible with a power chair). My husband asked the manager why they advertised themselves as wheelchair accessible if they weren't, and she said they've never had a problem because busboys have always just lifted customers in wheelchairs into the place. 

That's unsafe and unacceptable service, and also does not in any way mean that a restaurant is \"accessible.\" They did not apologize, or indicate that it was an issue on their part in any way, or express anything such as \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience.\" The hostess and manager were both very rude, and the manager was hugely unprofessional for such a \"nice\" place. It was embarrassing for them, and I don't understand how they can justify not even having a cheap portable ramp for customers...that just seems ridiculous, especially given the fact that many older customers go there. I've never heard of such a thing at a nice restaurant, especially not without an apology. We went to Pier W instead, much better and more professional service."}
{"text":"The food and ambiance is wonderful! Our waitress on Saturday September 2 at 7pm in the Loon room was fantastic! I was very disappointed with the attitude of the bartender while we were waiting for our table she was very rude and rolled her eyes when we asked for a drink menu....I hope she didn't get part of the tip I left for our wonderful waitress ."}
{"text":"This Yelp rating is way too low!  I came here for years for a holiday dinner that the family I worked for in high school would have for their employees, and it was always a treat.  I recently returned for a birthday dinner with my family and wondered if it would live up to my memory, but it's still wonderful.  The food is great, the place has history and a lovely ambiance, and they were really nice to my Nana even as she asked them for about 10 gallons of au jus with her meal.  I hope it never changes!"}
{"text":"On my brides and mine 9th year anniversary, we went to White Oaks to celebrate. It is always our go to restaurant when we want an great meal and just a beautiful view. We have eaten in several of the rooms there, but the best view is against the window, with deer, duck and other miscellaneous animals wandering in the creek below. Another little nice touch they do is before dinner, they bring you a little complimentary relish tray; something not found in restaurants of this quality. Overall, whether it be a special occasion or just wanting a good quality meal, you just can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"White Oaks represents an important part of Cleveland history and is a great place to eat. During prohibition, it was a speakeasy catering to the crème de la crème and it honors that rich history with its decor and food. The interior is split into many small rooms covered in dark wood and rich colors with fireplaces spread throughout. The backside of the restaurant overlooks a small creek. The menu is very traditional - steaks, seafood, chicken, game.  They offer a separate menu in the bar of sandwiches and burgers. I've been here many, many times and have always had good food, good service and stiff drinks.

Last February, they also hosted my wedding rehearsal dinner in their private room for 50+ guests and I can honestly say they handled everything perfectly. I have never had such delicious, well-prepared and plated food at a large, sit-down dinner party. The waitstaff was very attentive and made sure the drinks and food were flowing. I would definitely host another event here.

FYI: It's better to make a reservation on weekends since they're pretty busy - they also offer free valet parking."}
{"text":"Fabulous! Cozy fireplaces everywhere, delicious food, fantastic service! Each room has so much character! We will be back for sure! Had the veal Marsala which was absolutely delicious:)"}
{"text":"We love the ambiance of White Oaks.  It's very intimate and sitting on the creek side is delightful.

The menu is always inviting and the service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"My husband and I go every year for our Birthdays, we love the atmosphere and the food is great. We always have to get the creme brulé for desert, its the best."}
{"text":"A classic. Food is always excellent. Steak and asparagus were perfect and the sun dried tomato butter was out of this world. My handsome date ordered stuffed pork tenderloin and said that is was wonderful.  Interior is a bit dated but only adds to the classic charm. The creek view is a must."}
{"text":"I've been to tons of fine dining restaurants in Ohio with my wife on our weekend date night but nothing compares to White Oaks. From the service to the food and atmosphere it's perfect for a nice romantic dinner with that special person. We've found ourselves skipping other restaurants and going straight to White Oaks lately. They get 5stars from me keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Not much to say sadly. Snooty pretentious hostess, didn't seem to care and had a false superiority complex. Lobster was okay but honestly a lobster that isn't okay is not a lobster. Their bread is the only redeeming quality. View was very scenic, they don't lie about that!"}
{"text":"Before deciding to make a long overdue trip to White Oaks, I was under the impression I was making a mercy mission to save this prohibition era speakeasy given the probable dominance by Crocker Park and sprawl to Avon Lake.  Boy was I mistaken.  The parking lot was jammed and therefore forced to eat in the lounge without a reservation.  In the end, probably a better choice.  The lounge, though seperate, actually shares the main dining room's huge picture window view of the heavily forested ravine and Cahoon Creek.  The rustic decorating and dark tones with a glowing fireplace makes you think you might be in a roaring 20's hideaway.  The bartender was a pro - courteous, efficient, \"healthy\" drink pourer.  The lounge menu struck us as pricey at first but fears were quelled when our neighbor's order arrived.  We opted for the steak sandwiches which came with potato or salad. Prepared perfectly and just enough to satisfy. We felt very good about our choices all around.  I was taken by the sheer number of people and traffic when compared to the prices, Cleveland economy and aforementioned new options.  It looks like White Oaks has not changed, serving excellent food and taking caring of its customers.  Definitely worth a re-review upon eating in the main dining room."}
{"text":"Great place to go for an anniversary or special occasion.  Atmosphere is nice and relaxed. Food and service are excellent. Ducks and deer in the creek are fun to watch."}
{"text":"First, if you want avant garde, fusion-style dining like you saw on some cooking reality show, this restaurant is not for you. The menu is online. If classic dishes like Beef Wellington, Veal Marsala, and slow-roasted Duckling don't appeal to your refined palate, eat somewhere else. If you want a sleek, modern dining room with an open floor plan, exposed kitchen, and fancy bathroom where you can't exactly tell how the sink works at first, this restaurant isn't for you. Second, the reason that the clientele is older is that they appreciate a leisurely meal with quality, traditional entrees in a classic setting; they don't need a bunch of unnecessary bells and shiny whistles to determine that their food tastes good. Unfortunately, most people under forty now associate quality with sleekness and modernity, so the appeal of the wood paneled and separated rooms, amazing bar, and country club feel seems to have been lost on my generation. The food was delicious, even their quirky cottage cheese and relish tray (which is NOT pickle relish, but relish as in fresh vegetables and olives). The service could be better. Our server was adequate, but not great. The busboys were the real problem; they were clearly never properly trained in etiquette. For example, that my plate is empty and silverware arranged in that manner indicates that I am finished. Don't ask me. Don't bring us our food when half of the table is in the bathroom. Don't ask if we want more water, just fill the glass. The service made me feel as if I we're at Outback or Longhorn. If your restaurant is going with an old-school vibe, you need to provide quality old-school service, or the experience does start to feel outdated and bland. The service was two stars, atmosphere and food were five."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great history, great experience! Make sure to call and reserve the lounge area so you can get a gorgeous view of the woods/creek below."}
{"text":"Very bad service. The girl at reception desk is confused and lazy.  The waitress was very rude and acted as if she owned the place. She gave us wrong info about their specials. She did not know the menu! 
The place is VERY old and did not look like it was updated in years however it does have a nice view. Workers do not smile. 
The salad was not fresh. It was kinda soggy and tasteless. $2 extra for some blue cheese on my salad ?!! 
The steak and lamb chops tasted good. 
The food is definitely overpriced. 
Overall, i do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary at White Oaks tonight. We had a Groupon. The setting of this restaurant is beautiful. Very nostalgic. We sat near one of their 5 fireplaces. The menu is intriguing. It's a bit pricey making it a place for special occasions for most. From the valet parking, to the front desk, to being seated to our waiters, every employee was quite pleasant. The food quality was top notch. What an enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"Went into white oaks to meet up the family. Instantly liked the atmosphere, and the valet was very polite. We  had one of the nicest, and most attentive servers ive dealt with lately. Her name was lauren. Very professional and the young lady had a great memory! She came over alittle after the food came out to make sure everything was perfect, and it was. Great service and food. Coming back soon!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go! Food is great and if you get a window seat you can see the wildlife outside which is really nice. The bar looks really cool and I haven't tried it yet. I really like the rich history of the restaurant. The original front door has a little window that was used during prohibition as a lookout when it was a speakeasy."}
{"text":"Classic restaurant with excellent nature views. Our meals were prepared to our taste. Service was quick and pleasingly efficient. Restaurant has an interesting past. You must read the back of the menu."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced for the food and it was just okay.... Every time I spend $80 on meals for 2, I expect the quality of the food to be better than this.... Was extremely disappointed.. Made a point to drive over 30 min to this place... At least the restaurant itself was cute..  Definitely will not be returning anyday soon"}
{"text":"Beautiful views, delicious food, and great service. Oh yeah, and quite possibly the best bread and butter ive ever had."}
{"text":"Always have loved the atmosphere and have enjoyed our meals.  Lately very disappointed.  Our orders were borderline satisfactory and overpriced.  The simple relish tray was not enough for six , the lighting so dim that we almost missed the fact that we had been overcharged, not once but twice. Our waiter was always in a hurry and never available.  We always had to ask someone else for service.  Sorry, White Oaks.  Regretfully we will not be back."}
{"text":"Great place for any occasion.  We have never been disappointed in the food or service.  Tops for special occasions."}
{"text":"We go every year for my father in-laws bday. His favorite place...well not the rest of us :( I like the location and history is wonderful. The dark wood and the old speakeasy feel. Menu is not the typical menu, venison, duck, ostrich, a couple of chicken options, salmon, and pasta. The bread is served hot and lots of times you can see the man in charge making it in the oven that is located in one of the dining. Maybe something is said for the ambiance over the taste!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place more stars but I just cant. We started with the fondue which I enjoyed. Dipping the complimentary parmesan bread in it was really good. My mom got the double lobster tails which were good and they still give you the butter with the candle underneathe it to keep it hot unlike most places nowadays. Now that brings me to my meal which I was really looking forward to. I rarely get the opportunity to eat duck and when I have its been phenomenal. Apparently here, they slow roast the half duck you get and cook it all the way thru. Now all the duck breast Ive ever had are cooked no more than medium. Needless to say doing that made all the meat dry. I was rather disappointed and when I asked the server about it he looked puzzled as if he never heard of it, which Im assuming he didnt. He then went on to tell me about how they cooked it. If you like duck and find out a place cooks their duck all the way thru dont go there. Id come back if it wasnt so expensive for the food."}
{"text":"First time here. Passed by the sign several times and was curious about the place. One day saw it on groupon and I bought it! The place from the outside doesn't look like much but when you walk in, it's so much nicer. The food and service was great! Fresh baked bread to your table. I had the lamb chops and it was one of the best lamp chops I ever had! It was very juicy, soft & melts in your mouth. I would definitely come back again and add the extra pieces!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would.  

I have been a customer at White Oaks for decades.  I have recommended it to many people over the years, and our family has celebrated many special occasions there.   On New Year's Eve, I took a family friend and my 99 yr. old mother to White Oaks, as it has always been her favorite restaurant.  However, it was the worst and most disappointing experience I have had in recent restaurant memory. 

The menu was a limited menu (not uncommon on a holiday) however, the prices were very high for food that tasted like it had been prepared for a banquet.  Less than even average quality.  However, the service was the most disappointing part of the evening.  They got one soup order wrong, and by the time they got the correct soup, the two soups which had been served were cold.  Next came two of the entrees, BEFORE the salad was served.  When I told the food server that we wanted our salads first, he informed me that \"it is the busiest night of the year, and we can't have food getting backed up in the kitchen.\"  Not my problem!  If you can't handle that many people, then don't take the reservation.  Before the deserts were even brought to the table, the check was presented.  At that point, we felt like \"eat and get out!\"  Clearly, they were more interested in turning the tables over as many times as they could, as opposed to offering quality food and service.  

Overpriced, bland food, disappointing service.  After years of coming to White Oaks, this New Year's Eve was my last visit."}
{"text":"A very cool place- nice menu and a cool looking dining room. Keep in mind it is on the west side so the staff is a little trashy but the food is very good and it's a nice atmosphere. I will for sure be back"}
{"text":"This is my first visit to the White Oaks and was initially lured in with a $50 groupon for $25. It is very dark, could definitely use a remodel with a professional decorator. My group of 3 was the youngest group dining late on a Thursday night. There is a large sign suggesting a dress code and a pretty conservative crowd. Another sign asks customers to refrain from using their cell phones.

We started out with cocktails, split of champagne for my girlfriend, I had the apple martini and other friend did the long island iced tea. All the drinks were fine, nothing special. 

We only did one appetizer, the chicken skewers. This way a great start to our meal. The meat was tasty, tender and grilled to perfection. Something I would definitely recommend. So yummy, my girlfriend placed another order for her entree. Along with the tomato and mozzarella salad, she said she was satisfied with the food and pricing. She did eat all her food, which rarely happens with her.

I had the filet (8 oz) cooked medium and I did upgrade ($3) for the demi glaze sauce. The sauce reminded me of a thin BBQ sauce, which I wasn't expecting. All in all, it was a nicely seared and seasoned (cooked perfectly) and the sauce was good. Not sure if the sauce was necessary, but it wasn't bad at all. This comes with a twice baked potato (just OK) and brussell sprouts and carrots (veggie of the day). I do like brussel sprouts, I didn't necessarily like these particular brussel sprouts but I ate them none the less. 

My other friend did the strip steak with the same sides. His steak was yummy, cooked well but perhaps a little under seasoned (for his taste). He hates brussel sprouts, and the twice baked potato got some attention (not too much though). I think he was the least pleased with his experience out of the three of us.

The service was 5 stars. Our server did a wonderful job and was very friendly and insightful. The view was great and I loved finding out about the history (open since 1928 and used to be a speakeasy). 

One thing I will add, we were the loudest table and a little buzzed as well. The staff was very gracious and didn't seem to be bothered by our liveliness. Not the best place to go for a fun dinner, but we sure did enjoy ourselves. Even if the other patrons were annoyed, I don't think I care. It seemed like they could use a little action in their lives anyway."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon and I had always wanted to try this place. We went to celebrate our anniversary . I made reservations and the hostess said she was going to \" look\" for a table and she came back and we were seated kinda abruptly in a room just to the left of the main lobby in a small room that lead to a larger room.  We were in the middle of the main traffic flow. Anytime people came in or out , we got a huge draft or cold air. The place was very busy and loud and perhaps there are romantic spots in this restaurant but we were not in one of them.  We felt there were people jammed in like sardines and it was too loud to be considered romantic. We could hear the young hostesses gossiping from our table. Our server was exceptional and the food was tasty. We went for the ambiance and it was lacking."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for an impromptu date night and were very pleased with the service. I loved the entry way that reminded me of an old speak easy where you have to give them a password before you are granted entrance, but of course that wasn't necessary. Then the ambiance was elegant walking in, but then again I like the woodsy cabin like feeling until we headed toward the back where they had the greatest view. I had always wanted to dine there due to the view everyone always mentioned was especially gorgeous during the winter, but we went during Spring. Still, we got seated in the room overlooking the creek and trees and got a chance to see a 7 point buck, a few dear, some ducks, squirrels, and other small wildlife hanging out by the stream and eating. It was kind of magical. My husband had the Pancetta mushroom chicken which he enjoyed tremendously and I had the Grilled Atlantic Salmon which was perfectly cooked and the baked potato was to die for. I also loved the olive and relish tray along with the bread. It was a great dinner and we can't wait to go back during the winter to see the fireplace running."}
{"text":"My wife and I just went to the restaurant yesterday.  We had early reservations.  White Oaks is a very classy rustic restaurant with great views of the outdoors.  We saw a flock of ducks circle and land on a frozen creek.  The last time we were there we saw a small herd of deer going through the creek and surrounding countryside.  The ambience in the restaurant is very warming and comforting.  The staff there is very friendly and courteous and took excellent care of us.
We ordered cocktails for starters.  Maddy, our waitress came out with a tray of veggies, cottage cheese and a basket of bread, which is always served.
My wife ordered the stuffed Tilapia, and I ordered the duck.  My wife enjoyed her Tilapia although she said the crab that the Tilapia was stuffed with had more filler than crab.  My duck was prepared well.  I took pictures of both our entrees. We both had leftovers that we took home with us.  We would have loved to try their desert menu, but we were both stuffed.
I was a little disappointed in the meals as they were not prepared as well as our meals the last time we visited, and that is the reason for only a 3 star rating.
We do plan on coming back and try other entrees as they have a very impressive and interesting menu."}
{"text":"With some of the bad service reviews, I had concerns about returning, but the four of us were treated with promptness and excellent service. The food was well prepared and arrived on time. 

If you desire a place where you can have a conversation with a great meal, White Oaks is a good bet. Other locales are often just too noisy. 

The one complaint we had was a little girl who ran around the place. We couldn't tell if she was a child of one of the patrons or staff, but her bouncing around was a bit distracting when we first arrived."}
{"text":"Hubby and I dined here last night, as we do on many special occasions. We enjoy the view from the \"porch\", and the food is always good, and plentiful. I would not have enjoyed the experience so much, however, if we hadn't been seated by the window. The inside rooms are cozy in the winter, however, with fireplaces blazing. We always arrive with a coupon, as apparently most do. I'm sure the fact that these are readily available keeps this business going, as it is rather pricy. One wonders if they would eliminate the coupons and bring the prices down a bit would they do as well?"}
{"text":"Another good experience.  Prime Rib..... Get it every time!  Salad was returned and a great one was brought out.  The service was good as usual. This place is one for the ages.  We will be back in the next month."}
{"text":"Amazing food! You wouldn't think it was the nice just by looking at the outside but the inside decor is wonderful. The Venison was perfectly cooked and the sauces were incredible it comes with the House rice which was also great. The Veal Marsala was a little too saucey for my taste but still really good. The dessert options are also great. Overall amazing place !"}
{"text":"We dined at White Oaks this past weekend and it was an awesome experience. This is a very throwback restaurant with a country club grille room vibe. The food is amazing with a menu that has some exotic choices such as Venison and Ostrich. I had the Venison and it was very tender and had great spice to it. The dining room has huge windows overlooking a creek in the woods. Very nice place for an anniversary. Very kind servers with no air of an upscale restaurant."}
{"text":"Want to love this place, but it doesn't want to love us back. Went as a party of nine last night.  Live in same suburb, but have only been here one other time.  That experience was so-so, this one was much worse.  This place advertises as a high-end, special occasion restaurant.  The entrance way is shabby-looking and downright dangerous for senior citizens who are probably the most frequent customers.  Should have realized that the too-dark lighting in lobby area and much of dining room is hiding something....mediocre food & drinks served with bad service.  Initial drinks too way too long to get and two had to be sent back...tasted awful!  Server was very nice, but seemed overwhelmed with number of tables and admitted this job was in-addition to her day job.  She was not a professional server and it showed.  Forgot drink requests, took too long to check-in with us, never presented dessert menu (which was finally offered by a bus boy).  Bartender and/or the bar ingredients were not good. One of three appetizers (panko breaded shrimp) was overcooked.  Entrees were all overpriced and only one (lamb chops) was decent.  The steak was smothered with some greasy sauce and way too many onions.  With service so bad, we didn't bother sending back.  No manager ever checked in with us.....party of 9 spending many hundreds of $$ ought to get some attention.  If you're in Westlake and want high-end food, go to Cabin Club.  If you just have to try this, sit in bar area and order from bar-only menu.  This place needs to start over....they have a great location but an outdated facility, uncaring staff, and overpriced menu."}
{"text":"We visited 11/3/15  This was a first time visit to White Oaks. Visited  for our 37th  anniversary. Excellent service. Lobster bisque excellent. We had venison and filet mignon. Both were wonderful   Dessert was great too. Fun watching deer and raccoons including albino raccoon out the window while we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"Good service; so-so food; lovely setting. Chef is rigid and will not respond to individual diner's request for slight modification. Not worth the high prices. I recommend you look elsewhere."}
{"text":"On August 26th: I went to White Oaks to take myself on a nice dinner while out on my day trip to Cleveland from New York. From the moment I walked in I felt unwelcome. As soon as I  walked in, it almost felt like a sense of disgust came over some of the people occupying the front - a couple of people who looked like managers. There's a sign at the front that says suggested attire was a collared shirt for men and I didn't have one on, so I figured at first maybe I'm just not fitting into the look they were going for and they're disgusted by that- hopefully no other reason. After being told that I could not sit by the window because there were no seats available, which was ok, I however was then placed at a table in the back in the corner. The young lady didn't really seem happy to be there I thought, again not thinking it's me. I'm sitting and observing, waiting to be greeted by my server. A young gentleman came over eventually with water. After waiting a few minutes I had to ask for a menu, since no one gave me one when other tables received it almost immediately. As I was observing, waiting- still haven't been greeted- I noticed the speed and type of service when it came to the other patrons was FAR more engaging and prompt. They were given water, followed by menus, proceeded by a complimentary bread basket and a vegetable plate, and shortly after a server greeted the table almost always with a smile. However, I was still sitting there with my water, and a menu waiting for someone to come over or even attempt to make eye contact. 

While waiting for someone to come over, a table suddenly became available for a couple by the window when I was told none were available. So I rationalized it, thinking they were a couple and it is supposed to be the most romantic restaurant in Cleveland, so I just left it alone . After a while, a server came over. Megan was friendly and professional. I told her I was there for the day and I came from New York. I also proceeded to tell her: I had been looking forward to coming to the restaurant and I had a Groupon to use. She said she would process it at the end and after telling me the specials, she took my order. After she left the table, a few moments later, I finally recieved my bread basket and vegetable plate.

As I'm enjoying my bread, which was absolutely delicious, the looks and energy when it came to my presence was less than appetizing. It seemed like me being in the restaurant (which had a steady flow, not busy from how it appeared) was inconvenient and a problem. Megan comes back to the table and tells me that I can't use the Groupon because I needed to have 2 people. I explained to her again that I'm taking myself on this day trip and I came from New York alone, and chose to come to White Oaks specifically. The manager didn't come over or even try to make accommodations, recommendations or anything. I was highly disappointed. Especialliy, after looking forward to this meal all day and not wanting to really eat because I knew I was coming to White Oaks. Instead of cancelling my order entirely, I kept the lobster bisque I orginally ordered as my starter.

Megan was apologetic and empathetic which was appreciated.   As I was leaving: the same disgusted, bothered and unwelcoming energy I recieved coming in, I recieved leaving too. At least they were consistent. I don't want to think that it's because I was a person of color that I recieved this unfortunate level of service. I'll just say maybe it's because I didn't have a collard shirt."}
{"text":"We love bread, butter, and two appetizers - Brie and teriyaki shrimp with sushi rice.  The complimentary salad in wine vinaigrette was very bland and disappointing.  I ordered roast duck, again, pretty fatty and not very flavorful.  My husband ordered swordfish, and he said it was so so.  Sides - wild rice, green bean, and carrots - were bland as well.  

Presentation was like home style.  They should reduce the portion size and focus more on the flavor. 

Service was so so.  The greeters were busy chatting with each other and not friendly at all. 

This is surely a restaurant which I will not frequent at all."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with my wife. We have not been to White Oaks in probably 15 years. We have a hard time getting out so was looking forward to a nice evening. 

The atmosphere is unique, the food very good. Our waitress  was HORRIBLE and put a damper on an otherwise nice evening.  In a hurry and unfriendly. Last thing I want when going out for a relaxing meal is to deal with a waitress with an attitude. 

For the price I would expect a much more welcoming attitude."}
{"text":"This place has definitely seen better days.  We went there on Easter.  I still like the beef Wellington even though it was over cooked this time.  The other entrees and sides we ordered were very mediocre at best.  Twice baked potato was dry and tasteless.  And the tiny relish dish and tiny dish of cottage cheese were a joke.  We had 6 people.  How are we supposed to share? The food definitely does not justify the high prices.  The history and nostalgia are kind of nice though and It would be a shame for such a longtime institution to go out of business even though it deserves to.  It really needs to try harder.  Seems to mostly appeal to a much older crowd (80+)."}
{"text":"Great old fashioned service and atmosphere.  Classic delicious food. Not loud.  Beautiful view of creek.  Always count on a great meal."}
{"text":"Okay, so the potential is really there for these guys but something has gone terribly wrong! From the weird entryway to the dark lobby, I wasn't surprised to see the white linen tablecloth had holes in it and was   tattered. The veggie and cottage cheese plate was something from a retirement community. Beef Wellington was tar tar in the center... Veggies were more butter than veg. Waitress' timing was so off, and even though we were first in the room, we were last to be served. If asked, I would have had 2 more glasses of wine but I didn't get the chance. Also, it was my birthday dinner, and the next morning I had a wonderful remembrance of the dinner while on the toilet. I was sick for a few hours and had to take a half day off of work.  I also got some great coupons for next time.... Not!!!!! 
Unless they have a completely new owner or makeover I will never return."}
{"text":"I see how this restaurant is considered romantic. Crackling fireplaces, classic American decor, dark wood paneling.  However, when we went there for Valentine's Day, we were seated in a small room off of the main dining room that did not have the same atmosphere or character. We ordered mussels which were good, the beef Wellington, and the jumbo scampies. Service was great, very attentive."}
{"text":"We dined for our 5 year Wedding Anniversary! Absolutely excellent service! Our waiter was wonderful! Wine was a delicious woodsy Cabernet ,the steaks were grilled to absolute perfection & the fondue was to die for! Very interesting rich history in this dining establishment too! The experience is definitely exquisite and romantic. We requested a more private area & was kindly accommodated & so perfectly might I add! The room was adorned in oak candlelit tables ,white tablecloth & a gorgeous burning fireplace. We will be dining here again very soon! Highly recommended A++++++"}
{"text":"This place is so old school cool, and was a speak-easy way back in the day.  Rustic charm throughout the building with a great view of Cahoon Creek from the bar area.  Food is always well prepared and service has never disappointed.  Last night I had the ribeye, while my partner had the salmon.  Both great as always.  I tried their signature onion soup for the first time and can guarantee you it will not be my last.  Might be the best onion soup I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"Really expected more.  The hype was really making me think I was going to experience world class dining.  

We were the youngest people in the place.  And I'm no spring chicken.

The decor has not been cleaned in ages.  Cool decor, but for God's sake... clean it.  Spruce it up.

The view over the creek in the back was nice.  Very nice.  Not awe inspiring.

The food.  Oh... the food.  Well, to start, they brought out a dish of olives and radishes.  I believe there was like... one of each?  Weird.  Very weird.  

The meal, although not bad, was not all that and a bad of chips.  Heck, I didn't even call my mother, much less write home about it.  

The veggies were all weirdly julienned.  LIke we were getting served nursing home food.  Very overcooked. Hmmm.

The meal. (veal marsala?  I couldn't tell... honestly.)  It was OK.  Just OK.  

Service was fine.  Very nice.  Place was quiet.  Think... morgue.  

Interestly enough, we apparently were \"lucky\" enough to sit by the one couple on the planet that just received their first cell phone.  Yes, they were THOSE type of people, loudly yelling into their phone, thinking that EVERYONE wanted to hear their insipid conversation.  If the chairs weren't so old fashioned and heavy, I might have tried swinging one at them.  Sigh.

Will I want to go back?  Maybe when I'm 80, and need overcooked, julienne veggies.  Meh.  I don't get the appeal.  Honestly.  Maybe it's from folks who just don't get out much?  Way too pricey for the quality."}
{"text":"I try to be a positive person so the first thing I'll mention is positive attributes. The waterboy rocks. He came by to refill our rather tiny water glasses almost every 10 minutes. You rock waterboy! The bread boy/ relish tray boy also rocks since it meant I could fill my starving stomach- that bread tho- AMAZING. It's crust of garlicky, Parmesany goodness was off the chain! They could probably do away with the carrots and celery, but the olives were good. And although the cottage cheese is random and a little odd, the chives that they added gave it a decent, unexpected flavor. We ordered the flatbread appetizer and the flavor wasn't bad but half of it was burned- not just a little over cooked, it was literally charred black. My fiancé ordered the Greek pasta dish and added chicken- good thing he did because he only got about 5 bow tie noodles. I wonder what the dish would have looked like if he didn't add the chicken... I got the beef Wellington- it was alright, but it kind of reminded me of hotel room service- good, but most definitely not worth the $30 I paid for it. Potatoes were dry too so I just didn't eat them. For the quality of food we received, this restaurant was wayyyyy overpriced. I don't mind paying the money for an excellent meal, but this just wasn't it. Also, our waitress wasn't all that great. It's like she was too scripted, but forgot some of her lines- I told her I needed some more time with the wine menu and when she came back, never asked me if I wanted a glass and ran away before I could ask her for one. She also brought our check before asking us if we wanted dessert- two things that we wanted and could have increased our bill and subsequently increased her tip. Needless to say, I probably won't return unless I miraculously see better reviews and hear they've stepped up their game. However, I do agree that the atmosphere is romantic as the restaurant boasts."}
{"text":"Food is good, as you would expect it to be at a higher end restaurant. It also has a historic look and feel.  

Service was mediocre at best.  They were slow to refill water, and skimpy on the bread basket.    We had to ask for everything from refills to bread to clearing.  We might go back, but will likely head to another place."}
{"text":"Larry p.This was the second time eating there ,as with the first time the food and service was spot on,though this time we had a window seat and the view was great lots of ducks and deer roaming ,there will be a return trip soon"}
{"text":"White Oaks is one of those classic old school restaurants that feels like you stepped back in time. The building has an elegant rambling look that is set on a picturesque lot overlooking a wooded stream. While there are multiple dinning rooms at the Oaks the one you want to be seated in is overlooking the creek - the outside entertainment of duck and deers helps set the ambiance of the evening.

After we ordered cocktails our server brought out the house relish tray consisting of celery, carrots, olives, radish and cottage cheese. Very old school and nice touch of appreciation for the customer. We ordered the bacon wrapped scallops appetizer that were ok just a bit over cooked. The dinner salad were good, enough to cleanse the plate, with crisp veggies. I recommend going with the oil and vinegar with optional blue cheese. 

My wife opted for the steak while I went for the venison. The steak and Bambi were both cooked correctly medium on the steak and a nice med rare (nice and pink) on the venison. The veggies with our meal of carrots and green beans were ok but not memorable.

The White Oaks is the type of place to visit if you want to see how adults used to enjoy and evening out. There are some unique standard menu items like venison, lamb and duck that you do not see at the typical restaurant. Romantic setting with multiple fireplaces, cool bar and a lot of prohibition memorabilia to set the mood."}
{"text":"Had a terrific meal with service to match at White Oaks this week.  A beautiful, almost lodge style paneled room overlooking a small creek.
Both my guest and I had the onion soup which was as good as I have ever had.  For entrees, my guest had the pork tenderloin which was served with an apple and walnut stuffing.  I had the fantastic beef welling which is hard to find in this area.  Both meals were excellent and moderately priced.
To top it off, if you get there at the right time, you can see to big bucks feeding near the creek.  
Great, food, great atmosphere, and great service."}
{"text":"The first time I went to White Oaks was for Valentine's Day this year.  Of course, being voted the most romantic restaurant in Cleveland, we could not get a reservation last minute, so we showed up at 5 when they opened and squeezed in at the bar, which is first come, first served.

The atmosphere was everything we'd hoped for.  The restaurant has a cozy, cabin-at-the-lake feel with several separate dining rooms, fireplaces throughout, and an entire wall of windows overlooking a creek in the back.

The service was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.  There was not a very extensive beer selection, so we chose to go with martinis, which did not disappoint!  The food was amazing, from the bread and relish tray they bring out at the beginning to the filet mignon that was served with a salad and 2 other sides... you could never leave this place hungry.

My boyfriend and I have since gone back and had dinner in the dining room, where we also had a great experience.  I would highly recommend White Oaks, especially for a date night or special occasion!"}
{"text":"We just had a great dining experience at White Oaks. Our waitress was prompt and attentive, the back waiter cordial and professional. The restaurant and experience were definitely old fashioned, from the cottage cheese and relish tray to the decor, but everything was pleasant. My only qualms would be the lack of mood music, as we felt part of the conversation of a table near us (however the head of the table was rather boisterous) and no beverage menu, so we hastily ordered house wine, when I'm sure other options were available. All in all, we had a lovely time."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner courtesy of The White Oaks.  We'd made a last minute reservation for a window table and they were able to accommodate us after a brief wait at the bar for a drink, or two ;).

The wait was worth it! We were seated at a comfortable table with the best view. Our waitress, Katie, was attentive and took great care to explain the menu and specials and helped us with drink pairings to complement our meal.

The food and service was excellent and the view was amazing. We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Seeing how the manager didnt even come out to see how a party of 18 is doing should be criminal."}
{"text":"It has been a decade since I have been to the White Oaks.  We used to have our New Year's Eve meals here--which by the way were memorable.  This year I have been going back to the old \"tried and true\" restaurants that were on my dining back burner.  We had a \"rock star\" table, on the area overlooking the creek and beside a burning fireplace.  Since we arrived late, we had the entire area almost to ourselves.  The wait staff was very attentive and the food superb.  My brother and I decided to relive the past by having the Australian lobster tail.  Don't miss this if you are a lobster lover.  I will not wait another ten years to return."}
{"text":"The food here is not anything great. For that kind of money they charge, what you get is not what you pay for. Service is not exactly friendly. Very inhospitable. Just an overall disappointment with the lack of professionalism in the staff, even the manager was of disservice in any effort to make us satisfied. I always give the customer anything they want if something wasn't prepared right or anything went wrong at my job. Came with high expectations and was let down. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Terrible experience, terrible food, and you walk out paying a fortune."}
{"text":"I'm terrible at writing reviews. I am also terrible at trash talking a restaurant too. I'll keep it short and simple since I do not have the gift of composition or writing.

White Oaks is stuffy. No worries we were dressed up in our polished shoes and dinner jackets. When I say stuffy I mean old folk, upscale retirement resort stuffy. I smelled brut cologne and white diamond perfume the whole time during my dinner.  
Other than the scenic nature views outside the dining room window there was nothing romantic about our date night dinner.  

Food- Ok this is why I felt compelled to write about WO. We ordered the escargo, ahi tuna, and cheese fondue for starters. The escargo was good and prepared just how we expected it. The ahi tuna was oh so freezer fresh and questionable whether it was frozen and then seared verses thawing the tuna and searing it.  The cheese fondue  was ok. it would've been better if the bread wasn't stale. The bread served for the fondue was white garbage bread that was so stale it should have been ground and made into bread crumbs. Before our salads arrived a platter of canned pickle relish, applesauce, cottage cheese, and more stale bread with margarine patties were brought to the table. Huh?  Cottage cheese? Applesauce? Canned pickle relish? Yes, these items are complimentary. They automatically are served with entrees. No thank you. I don't want a plate of sweet pickle relish from a can (Heinz or no Heinz) and cottage cheese served before my dinner. I would much rather prefer non stale bread and butter or olive oil or whatever. The whole cottage cheese, applesauce, and relish should have been our cue to get the hell out of White Oaks and revisit fifty years later when we have dentures and bifocals. Salads arrived. We both upgraded our salads to the ceasar salad instead of the house salad that automatically comes with dinner. How do you mess up a ceasar salad? Easy! You chop up romaine lettuce, spoon some canned ceasar dressing on it, and garnish it with powdered parmesian cheese, and store bought croutons. Yuck! Entrees arrived. Again, we both ordered the same entree. Rack of lamb (34$). It was perfectly cooked medium rare and seasoned appropriately. Enough said. My potato choice was a mashed. J had a baked potato choice. The vegetable was zucchini and red peppers.

Libiations-  don't expect any boutique wines or crafted cocktails. Most of the wines by the bottle are the same you find at gas stations or convenience stores. There was no Veuve champagne available by the bottle and nothing in $90 price range for reds. We just ended up drinking multiple Maker's mark and bottle beer. Speaking of beer. Don't expect a crafted selection either.


Never ever ever go to White Oaks $280 for two people. We were so sorry we didn't make the trip to Chez or Ken Stewarts, or Lola, or even Hyde frickin Park for a fancy night out. Uggh so frustrating"}
{"text":"I chose oaks for an anniversary dinner with my girlfriend.

Staff/atmosphere:
With reservations made 2 weeks in advance and arriving 5 minutes early, the young hostess staff fumbled and scrambled to find us seats which ended up being to the left as you walk in. The view from our seats was horrible. Outside the window was an old porch, with two dirty chairs on it. The atmosphere inside the place was nice, in every room beside which we were sat in. The wait staff was generally pleasant. 

Food:
Subpar. The classic relish tray had green olives that were seriously strong. The water glass on the table was not enough to wash the taste down. My steak, as well as my girlfriends was only okay. There was little to no seasoning on the steak, and cutting into my potato I found green, undercooked food food in front of me. The bread that they brought with the meal was the best part. 

Overall:
For paying 80 dollars, I really expected more. Making reservations early, I had hoped to be placed in a better section of the building. Walking around after our meal, I found outstanding views of nature and the river below- which I wish I would have been able to see while eating. The food wasn't all that great. The service was only okay and the hostess staff seemed lost. 

I will not return or recommend."}
{"text":"NO EFFORTS TO ACCOMMODATE!!  I was planning a special occasion birthday dinner and was looking for a \"total package\" restaurant... formal and classy, good food, great atmosphere and views.  After much research, I specifically chose White Oaks due to the picturesque descriptions in the reviews...the Birthday Girl is 100% all about recording events through photos!  I made a 7pm reservation for 5 guests on a Sunday (they close at 8pm), alerted them of the birthday occasion, and was informed that my request for a window seat would be on a first come basis. I was looking forward to the ambience, and was planning for some great photos to commemorate the night. 

At our on-time arrival, the hostess indicated that a window table was not available; we hesitantly opted not to wait since it was so late in the evening.  We were then greeted by our server who also seated us.  I again relayed my disappointment re the non-window seat/ no scenery, and emphasized the importance and our desire for taking some photos.  While heading to our seats, I noticed several unoccupied window tables in one of the back rooms and asked about them.  The server made an evasive comment about the bar-side, and overtly pointed out that the only 2 window tables able to accommodate our group size were taken (...only 2 in the entire restaurant!!?!). I accepted the explanation and indicated our back-up plan -- place our order, and while waiting for our food, we would go outside for a photo op with the creek backdrop...reiterating it was a birthday celebration. The server interjected and referenced limited views on the exterior of the building, and cautioned us about private areas bordering the property of which to stay clear.  She offered no suggestions, and seemingly discounted the importance to us.  With no options, we headed outside anyway to investigate for ourselves.  Well...there are, in fact, NO VIEWS!!!  You would never know a creek existed in the rear of the building!  A small backdrop of trees near a private driveway may have sufficed for photos were it not for a dirty bucket, an unraveled hose, half-empty bags of landscaping material, and some trash on White Oaks grounds.  So, our special occasion photos were taken in the parking lot next to a bush, with the busy highway in the background!  Frustrated, I decided to check out the unoccupied window tables while returning to our seats. To my dismay, I found approximately ten 2 & 4 person tables in one of the two back \"window rooms\".....and of those ten tables, only ONE was occupied by a couple..the room was virtually empty!  Staff EASILY could have put any of the remaining tables together to accommodate us without crowding other guests or losing seating. It was the end of the night, only one small group of 5 was seated after us, and the restaurant was almost deserted!  I hold the opinion that staff just didn't want to bother moving tables near to closing time.  My complaint is not that we didn't have the view...I was willing to accept that when we chose not to wait for a table.  My issue is that the view WAS available and the staff CHOSE not to accommodate us when they easily could have.  Also, when staff took my reservation for five guests, it would have been nice to know that my chances of getting that desired window table were slim-to-none since there are only two large tables even available in that area!

Re other aspects of the restaurant...the menu was limited, timely service and server-attentiveness was average, the meal was average, prices were high ($240 for 5 main courses and a one-person birthday dessert), and as noted in another review, there was no background music playing, which made it seem even more like....\"We are ready to close, hurry up and get out of here!\"  We could have gone to any restaurant if we were looking for \"average\", but we were willing to foot the higher bill for a memorable evening.  We were sadly and completely disappointed!  The beautiful scenery that makes \"the average\" tolerable is only available to a very few patrons, in groups of 4 guests or less.  We will look elsewhere for future special occasion dinners, and will NOT return!!"}
{"text":"Real Nice!   

     This restaurant was recommended by a friend.  We enjoyed our meal and the ambiance was cozy.     Worth a look!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Personal Preference
Old decor. Ducks everywhere. Reminds me of a lodge. 

Service: 1\5
Drinks came fast but that was it. Food took at least 25 minutes if not longer. Gave a star because they waived the dessert cost because it took so long to get the food. Waiter was nice though. But also took forever to get dessert menu.

Food: 2\5
My steak was underdone. My wife's was over. Missed the medium mark in both steaks. There was little to no seasoning on anything. Steak was seasoned ok though. 

Overall: 2\5 
Was not the best experience. Usually as long as the food is good  the rest will be overlooked. But unfortunately WO didn't even have that going for it. 

Will not return."}
{"text":"This is a very quiet, dark restruant.  The food is not cheap and usually is very good.  We have ate here about a dozen times, only had problems once.  The service is a little slower than most, but an upscale place pace.  The food is good, not always excellent.  The portions can be a little small.  The views on the creek are excellent and worth asking for. If you have a coupon book or groupon, you will get your moneys worth.  The drinks are over priced.  The rating would be three and a half if I could split a star."}
{"text":"To appreciate this place you need to know the history of prohibition in America.  It is very atmospheric.  I really appreciate its lost in time charm.  If you demand cookie cutter chain decor or 100 % cohesiveness of decor you won't like it. If you want a local place with 70s meets 80s meet 1920s decor along with a relaxing view of a quiet stream a crooked floor and a roaring fire...get a classic drink and relax. You will enjoy."}
{"text":"Always been pleased with this restaurant but this visit was less than satisfactory.  It seems as if the server was in a hurry to get us on the way as quickly as possible.  What a rush!  The crudites were being wisked away as soon as they were placed on the table.  The twice baked potato was not homemade.  Won't consider going back in the near future.  There are too many good restaurants out there to consider this one!"}
{"text":"White Oaks is the perfect place for a romantic dinner. My husband and I came here for dinner on a Tuesday night and I made a reservation because they suggest it on their website. It was a good idea, because we got a seat by the window, which has beautiful views of the creek behind the restaurant.  We saw a lot of wildlife, mostly ducks and birds, it was cool. 

I bought the LivingSocial coupon to use for our visit and with that I felt that the value was pretty good. They had no questions taking the coupon, so thats a plus too.  
Our waitress was nice, very to-the-point but thorough.   I ordered the mushroom chicken pancetta and my husband had veal marsala.  All entrees come with a salad, bread and butter (really yummy butter!), and the twice baked potato and a vegetable.  It is always nice when the salad comes with the entree rather than having to pay extra.  

The food was okay in my opinion. I enjoyed it but would probably not order either of those dishes again. The whole experience and atmosphere was pleasant, and I would come back, but only if I had another coupon and the desire for a romantic dining experience that night."}
{"text":"The food and service was great. I left feeling full after we ate. Sometimes when you go to expensive places you do not get a lot of food but here was not the case. This was my first time here. When we arrived the outside was a little deceiving, meaning old looking. But when we entered the inside was nice. The theme was rustic. One suggestion is, we asked to sit by the window and we noticed right away that our table was on a slant by the window. Maybe you could look into fixing this. Expect to pay about $30 a plate here. There were a few less expensive options but not much. At the end, with our bill we were given a coupon which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"We went to White Oaks because we had some kind of coupon.  What I enjoy about this place is the atmosphere. We sat right next to the fireplace and if it had been light out, I think our view would've been great too.  There are old paintings all around and it just has that \"old timey\" feel.

The main issue I have is the pricing and the food. It's not trying to be cutting edge or appeal to my foodie taste buds. The food was fine but I wouldn't go without a coupon of some kind.

I appreciated the vegetable crudité and the fresh bread. I ordered the caprese salad.  I think it could've been dressed with something to add more flavor but the mozzarella was fresh.  I also had eggplant parmesan appetizer - cheesy and a nice fried coating. Nothing extraordinary but it was what I expected it to be.  I will say that the baked Alaska we had for dessert was tasty, especially with a little ice cream on top.

I will probably be back in another year or two simply because I love the atmosphere and it's nice to have a nice quiet dinner every once in a while. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for dinner with high hopes and were very disappointed. We were seated in an area that was much like an oversized closet - no view just a window that was covered with heavy curtains. The decor was dark, which I can deal with, but it was also dirty (splatters on the wall from who knows when). 

When the cottage cheese and few sticks of vegetables in ice arrived I just didn't get it, but looked past it and ordered a rib-eye steak, which claimed to be \"aged for great flavor\" according to their website. I can only image that the favor they were aiming for was reconstituted sawdust.  Well, depending on the type of sawdust that may have actually had more flavor than this steak. The steak, which I had ordered medium rare, was more like medium well. The vegetables (green beans and sliced carrots) were somewhat sad as well. It looked like something you would get at a diner, but with no flavor.
 
The one thing I can say is that the service was quick and prompt. Everything else was highly disappointing and we do not plan to return."}
{"text":"Their service is the slowest I have ever seen. I have been to Europe so I know slow service, but this is uncalled for.

The food is average. So I don't want to wait two hours for this food. I ordered medium well filet and half was medium rare.

Wont be back."}
{"text":"Haven't been to White Oaks in a few years and gave it a try over Christmastime. It really was a great choice as the atmosphere is made for a winter dining experience. Dark woods, fireplaces, a view of the creek ravine made the setting just right for the Yule Tide season. Although the White Oaks has a large seating capacity, it is broken up into several intimate and cozy dining areas, including the bar. Food was good-excellent salad. The lobster bisque was very good and all the entrees were prepared well. Our service was excellent-the best service is never having to ask for anything, yet not intruding or interrupting the dinner conversation."}
{"text":"We went here with a group of friends to celebrate the Christmas season.  Busy place, huge parking lot with free valet parking.  Old homey feeling with nice holiday decorations and warm fireplaces.  My wife and I arrived a few minutes later than the rest of our party.  I'm still waiting to see a menu.  I asked for one and never got one; had to share.  Interesting bread, flavorful.  I'm still waiting for my bread plate, never got one.  We ordered the scallop appetizers.  Again, no appetizer plates.  To describe the appetizer, think bacon with a hint of scallops and greasy sauce.  Not good.  Side salads came with entrees, nothing special.  We had the Beef Wellington.  The meat was perfectly prepared.  The pastry and flavor was incredibly bland.  Looking around our table, it looked like all of the beef entrees were prepared appropriately, but others seemed a bit greasy and not appetizing at all.  Twice baked potatoes were OK, side vegetables non-descript.  Wine list is basic, and of course they did not have our first choice.  Prices OK to high for what you get.  Also, there were no pickup cards for the valet, they just left the keys in your unlocked car and asked for your licence plate number.  There are Groupons for this place, valid every night but Saturday, and there are also coupons in the newspaper and other places.  I can't really complain about the steaks and the ambience, but the service and appetizers were terrible.  Needs improvement."}
{"text":"I wanted to like it but I didn't. It has the prices and atmosphere of a fancy restaurant but the taste of the food was not good for both my wife and I. I would not come here again."}
{"text":"This is the second time here for a special dinner. Made reservation for near the window overlooking the creek. Beautiful scenery and quiet setting. I had the \" Beef Wellington\", cooked as suggested on the menu, extremely tender and delicious. My wife had a \" special\" a Portabella strip steak\". Tender, moist and also delicious."}
{"text":"Wifey and I are in our early 30's and decided to venture over as we live close by. The decor might first appear outdated, but it really adds to the character of this place. We sat down at the last two spots available at the bar and surveyed the clientele; most of which appeared to be much older than us. But, that didn't stop us from enjoying ourselves.

Our cocktails, while simple, were the best drinks we've had since moving to Cleveland a few months ago.

We strayed away from the main dining menu and opted for the bar menu, which had many options. Food was awesome too. 
All in all, experience was great, staff was courteous (we really liked the Bartender), and the food and drink were great."}
{"text":"The food tasted very good. The service was ok, my boyfriend thought it was a little slow. We went with a group of six and were seated in a corner in a back room. No nice view for us! The prices were increased by at least a third of their normal prices for new years eve which made things even more disappointing. Pretty sure we will not return."}
{"text":"Came here on a Groupon and really enjoyed it. We even got a coupon to come back, which was nice.

Interior is rustic and cozy with various rooms with fireplaces throughout. Some dining areas have floor to ceiling windows over looking a creek. At the various times of year that I've gone, it's always pretty. 

Good is great too. Very flavorful options. We last started with bacon wrapped scallops and warm bread. The flavors were on point. The lobster bisque was also hearty and delicious. Entrees we had included a fried fish special (with fries) and pork dish served with twice baked potato and veggies.

I've never had a bad dish at White Oaks. Service is hit or miss but seems to be improving. I'll definitely be back and absolutely recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a very nice but old house with mallards on the walls? Have you ever wondered if you can fry and eat those mallards? If you haven't, you  are too normal and probably need to stop reading this review now.
\"Old Oaks\" gives you both: you can watch your mallard on the wall and eat it too.   A little overpriced and over-fried but who cares, if what you are eating away is your Trust fund money. If not, you might have couple of concerns: why is service so slow? Why is salad so generic? Where is variety? Your dad killed the duck, the deer, the cow, and that's what's for dinner, kids. Looks like he hunted them right here, in the creek restaurant is overlooking. I felt like I was visiting with rich American grandparents I never had. Soothing geriatric satiety, see you back in 40 years.  
Very cozy atmosphere, the fireplace, the wooden interior, excellent malbec.. 
But kids in  faded jeans and colored scarves want more for the money they earned. 
They want all that you offered, minus $10 for the entrée, plus live music and recycling bin at the doors.  
Even though my fiancée swore that was the best ( even though the first) deer he tried in his life. 
My beloved savage (deep sigh). 

P.S. Finally I know where rich republicans dine!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a native of Cleveland's west side and had been to White Oaks as a child. I had seen it on groupon several times and read about it online. Seemed very romantic, charming and I couldn't wait to visit. We sat at a table right next to the window..beautiful, serene view of nature!!! We love animals, so it was a treat to have this as the setting for dinner. The food was fantastic! The Shrimp cocktail was delicious, the wedge was so big we split it. The ribeye was grilled to the perfect temperature and flavorful. We were offered dessert, but dinner was so big we didn't have any room left lol. The atmosphere is warm, inviting and beautifully designed. Old school charm with an intriguing history...ask your server about the speak easy they had during prohibition...super cool story! We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I've seen a lot of mixed reviews about this joint, but I had to try it.

My parents used to go here for their anniversary every year for a very long time. They always told me about White Oaks but I never paid any mind to it.

So I bought a restaurant.com coupon for White Oaks back last year like in September and finally got around to using it this past weekend.

Honestly, this place was stellar, The whole atmosphere of the place was just a throwback to the old days and I absolutely loved all the dark wood everywhere and the large windows overlooking the creek. My other half noted that it reminded him of an old and cozy ski lodge in a way and he really loved it too! I understood what he meant with all the fireplaces and the dark ambiance. It was actually very romantic in my opinion!

We had reservations and were promptly seated, the service was friendly from the get-go. We both had a glass of Merlot and ordered filets. 

Along with fresh bread served before the meal, we were served cottage cheese with celery, carrots, olives, and radishes. I thought it was an excellent idea and a nice little appetizer on the house that was a surprising and fresh treat!

The steaks came and honestly it was mouth-watering delicious. The steaks were cooked to PERFECTION, and wrapped in a savory piece of bacon. The potatoes were  warm and tasty and the green beans cooked to the perfect slight crunch. 

Afterwards we opted out for desert due to being so full, but had some coffee and just chatted and admiring the place. I also noticed the bar area with a little cozy lounge. I definitely hope they have a happy hour because I will be back to try that out if so.

On a final note, I just wanted to say how neat it was that this restaurant is broken up into like four different sections, and each section has it's own theme in a way that all ties together with one main theme. It just was such a cool throwback and change of pace to all the modern upscale joints in Cleveland and this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time.

I'm so stoked to go back and enjoy this place more...especially in Spring when the view will be awesome with all the fresh green surfacing on the trees!"}
{"text":"I had veal Marsala and it was ok. The relish tray and cottage cheese are served to all tables with their meals and bread. The salmon was nice and I love the twice baked potatoes that come with all meals. Service is superb and the wine list and drinks are great."}
{"text":"We were first ones there with 5:00 reservations, however the hostess seated a couple that came in and stood behind us first(they were regulars, recognized by hostess) in which they got prime seating, we got seated at table 19 which was in the corner, the floor, table, and chairs were at a slant as the floor was uneven. When I asked the server for a different table, she stated I would need to go up front to ask the hostess. When I asked  hostess for the 4 seater table with the view by window, she was hesitant, as she stated others would be coming in. I    then reminded her that specific tables  could not be reserved ( according to what I was told when I called in reservation), that this is where we wanted to sit, she eventually sat us there. Now that the seating battle is over, on with the food which is pricy for what you get. The relish tray has an assortment of veggies over ice, when the ice melts, veggies are floating in water, not appealing trying to fish for veggies. The green olives floating in water give all other veggies a strong overpowering taste of olives. The menu on line shows a chocolate lava cake however I was told they discontinued that. When I mentioned that it shows up on the online menu, the server stated that they only update their website several times a year. Funny, you would think with the overpriced food, there is more than enough money to pay someone to keep their menu online current.  Would not go here again, as they seem to play favorites with their regulars. Also, if you have a groupn and think your going to get a deal, forget it, go elsewhere. As far as the server, ok at best, she never introduced herself, which would have been a nice personal touch. The building is old ,you will first go through an old  nasty screen door, which closes quickly and doesn't fit the décor. Also, if you want a draft beer, forget it, they don't have any. If you visit the restroom, the toilets are very short  be prepares to stoop low, which might not be a good place to take elderly or ones with medical issues. There aren't any hooks in stalls to hang purse. 
So much for an\" upscale restaurant\", its more like an unkept lodge in the woods."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years and often stop back in when I am in Cleveland. As the other reviewers have stated the lounge is very nice, I prefer to actually eat in lounge. Fireplace and excellent view of the creek in the back can be had in the lounge. More recently, as the other reviewers stated the place has been surprisingly busy. Hence the staff seemed a bit over loaded to say the least. The lounge was packed and only one bar tender! However, she was very nice given the tough situation. 
I have had the salmon and the walleye recently and both were good to excellent so I can't really complain about the food. My friend ordered the duck and it was excellent with a massive portion size. Valet parking available. 
I may have rated it a bit high for sentimental reasons and the atmosphere here is great.  So I guess Yeah, I am a fan and will undoubtably return."}
{"text":"White Oaks is definitely one of those places you shouldn't judge by their Yelp reviews, in my opinion. Everything from the atmosphere, to the food, to the service hit spot on for me! 

Lured in by an unused Groupon we purchased and no desire to grocery shop or cook dinner on a Monday night, my husband and I headed to White Oaks. It was pleasantly packed for a Monday night, which is always a good sign. Other reviewers described it best, as a cozy yet upscale dining experience. Very rustic and quaint. We got a seat next to the fireplace, right by the window overlooking the stream. I'm all about restaurants with great views, and White Oaks didn't disappoint. 

The food was phenomenal, albeit a bit expensive. I probably wouldn't dine here again outside of appetizers or lunch and drinks without a Groupon, but they seem to almost always have a Groupon deal running so that's a non-issue. We got the Pale Ale White Cheddar Cheese Fondue to start. Extremely tasty in and of itself, but what really made the app was the fresh baked Parmesan bread. We must have gone through three baskets of the stuff! My main dish was the Beef Wellington, and in contrast to the reviews on here, mine was cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious. Nothing but good things to say about the service as well. 

As long as White Oaks keeps their Groupon deals a-comin', we'll keep coming as well."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant and all it's speakeasy history! We also love watching the animals at the creek which is visible from many seats in the house. The food and service is wonderful and every time we come to Cleveland from San Diego, we come here. We go to MANY top rated fine dining establishments in California and here, and White Oaks is still our favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Don't come here for the food, but come here. The bar might be the coziest place in Northeast Ohio during the winter, with a crackling fire casting a glow on the wood paneled walls and ceiling and giant picture windows showcasing the woods and creek outside. The place has been around since 1928, and I don't think the menu has changed much. Have a martini, choose something off the menu that would be familiar to someone who time-traveled from 1950, and enjoy the brilliant atmosphere. The food is competent but forgettable. The space is too perfect to pass up."}
{"text":"Updating my review with more information. The manager, because he did not come visit our party of 18 to even say hello, did not know what our coupon was (not groupon). The waitress gave us a BS excuse, and because we did not want to make a scene aboit this or the waitress badmouthing the family called him from the parking lot. Even upon finding out that the party had a couple issues, he did not appear to say hello. I went to the bathroom and the waitress was complaining aloud to the other servers about her party of 18, there were 3 tables split among 4 families, and checks needed split accordingly even though members were forced to sit at a couple tables because you can only fit 6 people per. (I.e. one family of two, one family of 3 and then one from another family) now I understand their computers are seemingly ancient, but that's not the customers problem. With the prices of the food here they should be able to update, unless I'd guess that a majority of their business is one visit and using a coupon of some sort. We showed up, as a couple of two expecting to pay our own bill, with a coupon we purchased. One coupon for one table, us. I absolutely would not dine at this garbage restaurant without a coupon before the experience and not even with now. Even at Applebee's the manager greets every table, let alone one that could make your whole night."}
{"text":"We love White Oaks! Very intimate atmosphere,  great wait staff..and always a great meal! We love sitting by one of the six fireplaces they have! There is also a 5 point buck with only 3 legs running around, if you get a window seat, you're sure to see him and other great wildlife!"}
{"text":"I have been to the White Oaks many times. I always look forward to going and visiting the view of the creek, the warm, oaky lodge atmosphere and the smoldering fireplace. However, every time I leave, I'm left feeling disappointed and a little ripped off. 
The last time, we came with 8 people, and were given a teeny-tiny little vegetable tray big enough to serve two. One teeny-tiny veggie tray for 8 people. We asked for more, and received yet another teeny-tiny veggie tray. We had to beg for bread multiple times, and the service was astronomically slow when the place wasn't even half full. My parents suggest perhaps it was an off night, but for me it was the clincher. The menu is old fashioned and the so are the prices.
This place is beautiful but the last time I was there is likely the last-last time. The food and the service just aren't worth the price tag =("}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a night out without the kids.  We did have a Groupon so it's not like we picked it quite out of the blue however I had wanted to try this place for a while.   It doesn't look like much from the outside but when you step it, it's pretty nice.  Yes, some of the decor could be updated a bit however, we both loved the dark wood walls and the view overlooking the river is fabulous!  The food was excellent.  I can't say enough about the beer cheese fondue.  I could have ordered a second bowl of it for dinner!  We both had the special which was prime rib and it was cooked to our specifications and was outstanding.  The service was very good, too.  The waitress was very attentive but not hovering and she was very friendly.  I also noted that the Hostess who was not much over 20 years old, did a fabulous job of dealing with an irate, older gentleman who could not understand why she wouldn't immediately seat him at a window-side table that already had 2 reservations in front of him.  I gave her a lot of credit for putting up with him and remaining polite and professional.  We will definitely return even without a Groupon."}
{"text":"My guess is I would have had a better experience if I had eaten in the bar as the other reviewer did.  The overcooked steaks I saw served to others in our party would have been acceptable if on a bun.  The stuffed pork tenderloin I ordered seemingly spent a couple hours on a steam table and the \"fresh\" cranberry applesauce seemed to have lived the same fate.

While our waitress was gracious and accommodating, the rest of the staff was awful.  I painfully watched the bus staff running through the restaurant like bulls with their only priority being their tasks and no awareness of customers.  Pepper for one of our parties entrée, and bolting when they noticed a table needing bussed.  Same went for service on getting water or the hostess moving through the restaurant.  

Oh, and then the topper, a bussed plate from another table ends up in my lap.  I get a quick \"Sorry\" but no offer of assistance to deal with my now gravy stained shirt as they bolt off to the kitchen.  

While I was tempted to give the restaurant a single star review, there is really all the ingredients to make it a great dining experience with better customer focus.  Considerable effort needs to be made in the kitchen on providing entrees that are truly fresh and made to order.  The non-wait staff needs to realize that they are an integral part of the customer experience not just the schleppers of dirty dishes.  

The warm and inviting tones of the dark woods and fireplaces certainly could lend to this being a great venue, just need to get over the other hurdles to get things on track."}
{"text":"Wish I would have read the reviews first.got the ribeye stake medium...$30.it was raw...sent it back...took forever... Couple beers....bottle of wine for the misses$30...+ her meal$30....

{"text":"Went for dinner recently.  Enjoyed the fact that they have a lot of coupons out and that you can buy them on restaurant.com where I did for my dinner.  You can only buy $25 but that is fine.   The food was very good . The price for dinner before the coupon for two with top items for dinner,  and some added sides,  plus dessert split was about $125, after the coupon $100 and you tip on the pre coupon price so the coupon covered the tip. Nice.  I paid $12.50 for the coupon so I saved $12.50.   

They bring out one of those little serving trays of ice with  radish, olives and celery that you use to get as kids lots of places but rarely do I see that now.  They will refill it for you.  They bring hot roils with special butter that were tasty. 

Dinner includes two add-ons so its pretty filling.   I got the twice baked potato vs. the rice. I got the vegetable of the day.  Both were good.  The twice baked had some time on it that night but perked up with a little butter added. But we got asparagus too and it was nice.  I also got a Caesar salad which was very fresh and pre cut so it made easy eating and no cutting.

Split a chocolate lava cake with added vanilla ice cream.  Very tasty and enjoyable. 

Nice servers and nice attitudes.  I had no issues with any part of the service. 

Historic venue in what was a speakeasy in Prohibition.  

We were seated in the fireplace/lounge room with the view of the stream and it was lovely.  As one other reviewer said, not awe inspiring, but in an age of mass produced restaurants where the only view is the stuff on the walls so filled up with \"designed\" \"memorabilia\" this is an authentic spot with lots of old real stuff starting from the driveway and its location on a mostly suburban street; with a portico.  So don't expect too much and enjoy the fact that its not a chain place.  Some things spotted this trip. the \"cell phone\" booth by the front door; the liquor price sheet in the Men's room (mostly 30 to 50 cents) and the original door which is now the door to the Men's room.  Lots of others I saw but do not recall. 

  It could use someone giving it a lot more cleaning it would look nicer.  Its OK. Its not a dive or dirty,  but it could be improved and I don't know why they don't just have someone on that. 

But I will return as I like the location, the food and the unique aspect of the venue."}
{"text":"The White Oaks has been a Westlake insititution since the 1920s.  All its original customers still go there.  Seriously, the youngest people in there, besides us, were in their late 60s or early 70s.  Why?  

Hmmmm. Why indeed?  The menu is stuck in the 1950s.  Attempts to update with \"pizzas\" have fallen flat.  The prices for said menu are astronomical.  These are Les Nomades prices! 

The atmosphere is slightly newer.  Say, the late 1950s.  It is dark and red and sticky and musty.  The entrance smells moldy and... lavatory-ish.

All this I would tolerate for a good meal.  Sadly neither I nor my party had one.  The food was bland, mushy and overcooked.  Perhaps so as not to damage the dentures?  In any case, I was green after leaving and sick throughout the night."}
{"text":"This was a go to for us for years. The atmosphere of this depression era restaurant is great. Wood paneling, great old solid bar, wood burning fireplaces and a creek view that's just a delight. 

The last several visits were disappointing for us. Our last dinner was sadly our last in the dining room. We had reservations about 6pm. We had a drink in the bar and were sat right on time. We didn't have our waitress arrive at our table for 10 minutes. Good think we had drinks. When she arrived she dropped our menus and a wine list and disappeared for another 10 minutes. The wine list is VERY pedestrian and the wines by the glass are mostly cheap wines. Think Cavit and Fetzer. No joke. 

When she finally came back she was ready to take our order, but didn't ask about new drinks or appetizers. We had to pace that. We got the shrimp cocktail, which was fine. However, the dishes were never cleared before the salad came and the same with the salad plates. Our meals too longer than expected and we sat with our finished salad plates in front of us until they arrived. No water refills or bussing of the table.

We each got the filet and tail. My steak and tail were cool/warm at best and cold at worse. The \"baked potato\" was steaming hot and was the only thing on the plate that was cooked within the last 10 minutes. Super dried out twice baked version. My husbands dish was a little warmer and must've been in a better spot under the lights.

It was very disappointing as we love this place. Just not what it once was for the price of dinner. We'll gladly get back to the bar, but no longer have a full dinner in the dining room and this experience was similar to our last two."}
{"text":"White Oaks provided the very worst dining experience I've ever encountered in my entire life, without exaggeration.  

I can almost guarantee Soviet political prisoners in the gulag had a better tasting meal than the unadulterated high-class slop that White Oaks passes off as food.  

Let's begin:
Not up for a drink, I ordered a Coke...umm....noooo...Pepsi? Noooo....  This high class dump won't even shell out the cash for a well known cola....  They gave me a generic cola (and didn't even tell me)!  

First, their menu was sparse, not that it should look like \"The Cheesecake Factory\" but they didn't provide enough variety of the basic offerings.  Second, the menu was as if we were in the frozen tundra of Alaska!  Most restaurants take off the heavier items for the Spring/Summer, they still had duck, Beef Wellington, pork chops etc. on there, which would have been fine if they had a greater offering of fish, or lighter pastas...they did not.  

As an appetizer we had the brie in puff pastry.  The puff pastry was hard, there was not enough honey or walnuts etc... to really taste it, just enough to know more should be there.  The way in which it was served was odd... to get a bite of pastry and brie was a juggling act in and of itself!

For dinner, I had the Beef Wellington.  It was tasteless, except for the sauce.  The sauce was sooo salty that no other flavors came through.  The pastry on the beef was equally tasteless. The ingredients did not complement each other.  

The twice baked potato was as dry as a Mitch Hedberg comedy sketch.  Seriously?? Even 10,000 chain restaurants don't screw that one up!  

My mom, who's wedding anniversary we were celebrating (thank God their marriage is going better than the celebratory meal!), had the signature duck dish (in June).  What looked to be tasty was only memorialized in the diner's mind by a reduction sauce or caramelized sauce that was 100% burnt!  It was just awful.  

The service was equally poor.  The server acted as if she couldn't care less, was not engaging, barely pleasant, and hardly acceptable.  They screwed up the duck order and gave mom a potato instead of the rice that should have been served.  Rather than apologizing and taking the entire entree back, they just threw a side of rice on the table which hardly looked seasoned and there was no presentation to it at all...no garnish.  

These people should not be in business.  Mind you, the average price of their entree is about $30 (not a la carte).  We couldn't wait to get out of there.  Normally I would complain, but everything was just so awful, it was clear these people don't know a thing about food, service, or presentation.  

The atmosphere was depressing.  It was like \"The Regal Beagle\" in Three's Company....you remember....the sit-com from THE SEVENTIES!!!!!

Go to Longhorn Steakhouse instead.  You'll get a better meal there, or for that matter, the steak taco at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Eh. Dishes were cooked nicely actually. My venison was tasty but uncoils tell the sides were just mass produced and dumped on the plate whenever people chose them. Upscale vibe- but food needs a bit more refining."}
{"text":"This was an amazing surprise. My husband made reservations and kept it a secret. When he finally told me where we were going, I'd never heard of it. But I definitely have this place on my radar now! A very nice dining experience. The food was outstanding. I think my husband's prime rib was tender enough to slice with a spoon. Excellent service, cozy atmosphere, and a great variety of food and wine/bar"}
{"text":"Another delicious meal in a cozy older establishment.  White Oaks opened in 1929. Liquor was bootlegged across Lake Erie from Canada daily.  Old photo memorabilia is on the walls.  On a cold Saturday the many rooms were packed with patrons.  Two large tables had folks celebrating birthdays.  The large room had a good vib.  We enjoyed our duck and prime rib.  So tasty.  I took half of mine home.  Service good.  The bar is retro and quaint with large windows overlooking Cahoon Creek.  It's a drive from the east side, but we have done it many times.  Started by using a Groupon three years ago."}
{"text":"For a restaurant that is supposed to be high class and romantic, I was thoroughly disappointed.  My wife and I had reservations for 8:30 on a Saturday night.  When we arrived we were initially seated at a rickety card table with folding legs and a tablecloth thrown over it.  My knees barely fit under the table, and if I couldn't imagine trying to cut a steak on this wobbly table.  It reminded me of holiday dinners at my grandparents when I was a kid.  For $30 a plate, I want to sit at the adult table, thank you.  We asked to be moved and were accommodated, but I can't believe that a restaurant like this would ask any of their customers to sit at a pop up card table.

A lot was made about the \"ambiance\" of the restaurant, the view through the wall of windows, and the multiple fireplaces.  However, neither of our seats gave us a good view, and the fireplace wasn't close at all.  The setting certainly was less than romantic.

I ordered the ribeye and my wife got the beef wellington.  Our meat was cooked properly and was a decent quality, but I've had as good or better for much less.  The service continued to be poor.  Neither of our drinks were refilled quickly, and it took the waitress much too long to get us a dessert menu and then our check.  

It's disappointing when a restaurant that is supposed to be one of the nicest in the city turns out to be such a disappointment.  Two dinners and one dessert ran over $75, and all we had to drink were iced tea.  Again, I've paid a lot less and gotten a lot more.  At this price I expect to be treated as an important customer.  I've had better service and nicer ambiance at chains, and the quality of the food wasn't enough to justify the price.  If you're looking for a nice high-class restaurant, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"A party of 5 went for dinner for a birthday celebration.  I have been to White Oaks in the past and have never been overly impressed.  The only reason we chose White Oaks is because they have beef wellington on their menu and the birthday boy was in much need of a fix.  

Needless to say, the beef weillington was average at best.  It stated on the menu that it is served medium rare, but was clearly medium well---a huge disappointment.  All our meals were pricey and none were above average in taste.  I don't mind paying $30+ for a meal, but expect it to be perfect.

They still serve a complimentary relish tray, but even that is not like it used to be.  It was a couple of olives and carrot sticks floating in cold water.

None in our party felt the need to ever return.  They either need to lower their prices or have higher standards in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I can understand the mixed reviews.  And definitely bring a coupon.
 
The service was friendly, if a little on the inefficient side. The view and the building are charming.  The atmosphere is nearly magical.  The wine list is priced very, very well - or else I would have really been unhappy.

Why?  Because the food is terribly, terribly overpriced.  That said, the duck was delicious (two of our table were very happy with our orders).  Husband's steak was okay.  I forget what the other diner had, but he seemed quite pleased with it.  But the prices!  Even with the Groupon, it was simply over the realms of reality.  Each entree included a salad and two sides, all priced $28-$30 EACH."}
