{"text":"Great quality of food for reasonable price. Taste better than Congee Wong, Queen etc, as food is less oily and no MSG taste. Free range chicken is one of the best in Toronto. The free soup is always tasty. The combo menus are bang for the bucks!"}
{"text":"We used to go here often and never once got the complimentary soup, what's up with that?  I stopped going there when they gave me a general Tsai chicken with black beans. Mind you this is not the first time I had this food. And when they told me that next time when I ordered I should say not to  put black beans, that's it, never went back again."}
{"text":"I still remember my first time having launch at this place with my classmates that was in January. I started my first semester at Seneca College. As the Chinese name of the restaurant, some fried food is great and the soup usually can make me to order it in next time."}
{"text":"I like to preface my review by saying I'm a very tolerant person when it comes to restaurant service. I understand that many Chinese restaurants' business model is geared towards high turn over. Thus customer service and retention is secondary at times - I accept that and embrace it because it keeps my costs low and palate satisfied. With that said, let me begin.   This was my second dining experience at Congee Delight. To their credit, the first time I ate here, I got exactly what I came for: a cheap, fast, and enjoyable meal, even with a complimentary house soup. Wonderful! So I didn't hesitate to come back.  Dining experience #2 was rather... unique to say the least. It started off much like last time. I ordered exactly the same dish - Beef Brisket on rice. Food came out fast , I began to eat... nom!   A third way through my meal, I noticed an object in my dish. Odd. It resembled a shard of glass... so I carefully examined the object: it had sharp edges and a very smooth surface. I was still uncertain, so I called the waitress over. she took it from me and quickly told me it was a piece of bone and walked away with it. Fair enough... maybe I was wrong. I had just gone to the gym and was starving. At that point, my stomach definitely convinced me to give them benefit of the doubt. So I continued to eat.   This time, I was carefully watching each piece of food. Low and behold, I came upon another object. However, to my surprise, this wasn't even like the \"glass\" that I found earlier. This was CLEARLY a broken piece of plastic from some type of kitchen utensil. Did they accidentally dump garbage into this brisket?! What the heck is going on?? Now I am actually laughing a bit and muttering \"For real??\"... because the probability of getting a double whammy must be astronomically low! Of course, I called over a waitress, and pointed out that THIS time, I got a piece of plastic. To be honest, I didn't know what I wanted out of letting her know... it was a $8.50 meal, 75% of which I've already consumed. I wasn't trying to get a free meal. I am not the type of person to cause a scene either. I guess I just wanted some kind of apologetic response... maybe a few words saying \"sorry this was an accident... we made a mistake\"... but no. all I got was a \"Oh.\" and a nonchalant walked away. Mind you, I spoke Chinese to her... so there was no language barrier.  I paid my bill and walked out... this was however the very first time where I dined and didn't tip. I really would have let it go if they just sincerely apologized. I know people make mistakes... accidents happen. But this was utterly ludicrous... it didn't sit right with me so I had to do something about it. Without confrontation or asking for \"reparations\", this is the method I chose. A review for any diners who are on the fence about this place. Maybe this will help you decide... \"Congee Delight - our dishes come with an unhealthy dose of unbiodegradable recyclables and splash of nonchalance!\"."}
{"text":"When I attended Seneca this spot became my favourite in the area. They have a huge menu and every time I go in I want to try at least 6 things on the menu. I definitely recommend coming here with a geoup of 2 or more people  as the dishes come eith nore than one serving. And when you enter the open concept dining area it feels inviting for large families and quiet dates. I just went here last night because its an old date spot for my bf and I . We always try to order some of our faves along with something new."}
{"text":"Probably one of the very few places that still serves one of my favourite dish : bbq pork changfun. Prices are reasonable, service is like that of other Chinese restaurants. The house dessert is pretty refreshing too. Just average I guess :)"}
{"text":"In the category of places with the word Congee in the name, this place ranks at the top for me.   Food quality, service and ambience are all high standard compared to competitors."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical coming here, because the menu looks exactly like Congee Queen, Wong, and I hate both of those places. I was here at around 12:45pm on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was about 60% full.  The quality here is exceptional given the price.  We ordered 4 different dishes - a fried rice noodle with beef, seafood congee, dumpling lo mein, and a rice noodle with beef. All 4 items were done exceptionally well.  I usually don't like congee, but the texture was perfect (i.e. not too thick, not too watery) and perfectly seasoned.  For 4.55 it was a pretty large portion and all 4 ppl at the table had a bowl.  The friend rice noodle was not too oily (as it usually is in most places) and not too salty.  The portion was average-size for 7.75 My favourite was the dumpling lo mein.  The 4 shrimp dumplings were perfectly done, with an excellent crunch, and very tasty.  For 4.55 I wasn't expecting very much, but this dish was exceptional.   Altogether, the bill came out to be $22 for 4 people (including tax).  For the price and portion size, I would recommend coming here."}
{"text":"A casual Cantonese eatery located inside a plaza.    A VIP card entitles you to 10% off but must be shown when you order.  The dishes here are pretty good if not a little heavy on the MSG.  Their dishes are smaller than most places I've been.  No free dessert unless you order one of their set menus or if you ask but you're not missing much anyways as it's tasteless and bland.  Standouts are the sweet and sour pork, ground beef + egg white fried rice and the egg tofu + seafood sizzling pot."}
{"text":"Close to Finch and Don Mills, Congee Delight is one of the few restaurants in this plaza. This plaza has tons of stuff though - No Frills, banks (both TD and RBC) and Service Ontario.  Came in here for lunch since I had a number errands to do and this place was convenient, even though I would rather spend my money elsewhere. This plaza needs an upgrade for food choices! We ordered Wonton Noodles, Suey Gao Noodles and Dry Wonton Noodles, with soup on the side.  I absolutely hated my Suey Gao Noodles. The entire meal was bland, even after adding multiple sauces. The noodles were hard and not chewy at all. The meat inside the suey gao was more mushy, and at some points even had the shells in them. Completely disgusting to eat. Needless to say, I did not finish my meal.  My mom who ordered the Dry Wonton Noodles said the same thing about her meal. Her wontons were bland. She also added a lot of sauce and it still didn't help. She didn't finish her meal either.  Definitely reaffirmed my previous review of this place... Would only come here because it's convenient in this area, or when my friends/family wants to go. Other than that, I won't ever step into this restaurant."}
{"text":"They were once good. I am not talking about the service of their wait staff. If you can tolerate waiters ignoring you or having to repeatedly request for things, then I congratulate you as I cannot - would not - allow my stress to take over my enjoyment of anything.  Their food was good (bordering the realm of 4-stars), but I would have to decline any invitation to return, as they have changed. Furthermore, the amount of MSG that I feel they use for their noodle soup broth is through the roof."}
{"text":"I made a visit to Congee Delight with my family recently and I was not disappointed. The food was absolutely delicious from the quality you would expect form casual Cantonese cuisine. The Seafood and Assorted Meat with Tofu in Hot Pot was piping hot when it came to our table and it had a lot of flavour from its sauce. The Boiled Free Range Chicken had a lot of flavour in it skin, which was a nice compliment to the Green Onion and Ginger Sauce. The Yeung Chow Fried Rice was delicious, compared to other fried rices I have eaten.   The service was very decent as the waiters did not rush us during our meal , which was nice since a lot of the other restaurants do rush their diners during their meals. Overall, I was very satisfied with the meal and I can't wait to come back again for more."}
{"text":"Decided to go for lunch to give them a try, first and last time coming here. I went in for one, got seated, and it took them 5 minutes just to serve me tea and give me the menu. The workers saw me looking at them yet proceed to place plates on tables. I let that slide. Food was mediocre. When it came to the bill regardless of how much I ordered, I should have the option to choose how much I tip. I paid and waited for 10 minutes for my change, it never came back. They should not assume just because it's not a big bill doesn't mean everything on top of the bill is tips. Tips reflect to how your service is. So needless to say I walked out after 10 minutes without seeing my change (while other tables got their change back even though they got their bill after mine)."}
{"text":"This is one of the most frequently visited restaurant since its opening a couple years ago. The quality of food is great, especially for the price. As for their service... It's very quick and you never have to wait long for your food. Which is a big thumbs up IMO since I'm usually starving when I get there. The only \"con\" is the last couple times I went was during the dinner rush and we had to wait to be seated, but it was more or less expected.   Now to the more exciting part... My favourites  - fish ball Ho fun... It's not really on the menu but all you have to do is ask for the noodle change and it's super delish and classic.  - crab fried rice? Can't remember the name but it's around 20 bucks ... Comes in a huge steamer with leaves, rice and crab - fried steam milk , it's under the snack page and it's a nice dessert  Lastly my most recent fave is the lo mien... Too bad it's not that filling... Or I'm just too hungry every time I order it."}
{"text":"Eh...C's cousin took us here to eat.   I was hoping this makes their Ginger & Scallion Crab as good as Congee Village in NY.   But they failed miserably - no flavour at all!  The Seafood noodle stuff was good - sorry I forgot the name of the noodle.  I don't know the difference between Chow Fun or Chow Mein. But it's the noodle that was crispy!"}
{"text":"This is place that is really close to home. For us its \"our\" local restaurant. We have a few days ago and enjoyed the food a lot.   The Super Congee was terrific as was the fried squid. We found an owner who is engaged and attentive and makes it a point to talk to the dinners at every table. This happened on both our visits. In addition the service is extremely good, and water glasses are both provided and re-filled a rarity in a Chinese restaurant.  They feature and enormous menu and the food is prepared quickly and well.   The pricing is extremely good and the portions are needless to say very large. For about $ 22.00 you can have a great meal for 2 and have left overs for lunch the following day.   Its a great value combined with good service and good taste."}
{"text":"i wish yelp lets you give half stars cause i would technically rate it 2.5/5  went to this place for some late dinner with my mom and dad. i have ate from here multiple times and honestly im not A HUGE fan. my dad loves it though and he's close with the owner.   **fun fact: my dad made the chairs and seating booths (the fabric that was used for the booths could've been better though in my opinion LOOL SORRY DAD)   so anyways this place was supposedly the BEST asian restaurant or whatever in 2013 or something and they even have this laminated newsletter to claim that. they also claim to use NO msg which lets be honest here that's pretty much a bunch of lies because one, i can taste it and two, it's quite hard to find places that don't use msg nowadays   food is nothing special really...some are too strong in flavour and some lack it. what i do recommend is the shrimp wonton egg noodles and the oyster egg pancake (don't remember what it's called) YALL NEED TO DIP IT INTO THE SAUCE. quite salty but gives it this interesting taste   but yeah, side note, they give you complimentary soup and dessert which is cool"}
{"text":"I was here today with a friend for a quick dinner/snack before going to my class.  The place is not really that busy when we came there so at first it was okay.   We waited to get what we ordered 10-15mins wait. The only thing that came fast was the drink that I ordered and its not that cold too (it has ice but the drink itself is a bit warm to my taste).  Also a fly got inside the restaurant and started to lurk on our spot/area.    When we finished eating the most frustrating part is that the lady in the counter scolded me that I did not gave the right tip. I was like Okay it's the first time someone scolded me about tips.   I did not like the experience in dining there. I did not enjoy the wait and the service and will not be coming back there."}
{"text":"Food tastes great.  Average price to portion ratios (the super bowl of congee is pretty big, but congee isn't too filling, so you can finish it.)"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times since it's close to home -- service is fast and the food is good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were a bit under the weather and decided to go for congee and came across this restaurant to order take out. The service provided by Ivy at the cashier was shockingly rude. We ordered the Golden super bowl congee ($9.25) and the minced beef noodle roll ($3.95). Ste charged us $17.18. I asked her why the price was higher, she pointed to the dinein menu and ordered, \"take a look\" apparently there has been a price adjustment. I tried to reason with her by showing her that their take out menu had another price. Ivy pointed to a fine print on the back of the take out menu and it said \"price subject to change without notice\" then bluntly asked, \"do you want to order or not? You don't have to order.\"  Even though the choice to continue to buy the food was ours to make, this is not an appropriate way to treat your customer, not an appropriate way to do business. If you have changed the prices on the menu, I know you can't help with the old menus that are already in the homes of your customers, but you should get rid of the old menus that are currently inside your restaurant! If you see a customer ordering from an old menu, you should inform the customer as well. This could have been a waste of time, the customer deciding to order something else, not order at all, or continue with the order but feeling cheated.   Tip for servers, \"you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.\"  A simple, \"I apologize for the discrepancies in our menu. Would you like to order still or would you like something else?\" Would have been much easier for us to swallow."}
{"text":"We often come here with my parents because they live close by and it's a good place for decent Chinese food. Service is good, and the food is quick and comes out fresh.   They always give complimentary soup and dessert for whatever you order.   We've tried many dishes, and everything is good so I don't think you can really go wrong."}
{"text":"Food is really disappointing there, price is too high, their food material makes people feel it is cheap, threw more than half of my take-out. Next time I would just order a subway next to it. Never will go there again."}
{"text":"Pros: Food comes out pretty quickly  Cons: Food could of been better (and less dangerous for babies) portions were on the smaller side  We wanted to go out for some congee because our little one was a little under the weather.  We had driven by this place a couple of times and finally decided to try it out.    Walking in, the place looks like it was recently renovated.  There are plenty of booths and tables in the middle.  The place is definitely bigger than it looks from the outside.  If you have ever been to Congee Wong/Queen/etc, you will definitely recognize the items you can have here,  It;s basically another entry in this type of restaurant.  We ordered the salted pork bone congee to compare with other places we have had it before.  A chicken chow mien was also ordered as well.    Unfortunately, the congee was very disappointing.  At other places, the salted pork bone congee was cooked with the broth from the salted pork bones which you can taste.  Here, it was obviously apparent that they just used their regular plain congee and just threw the pork bones in at the end.  Even worse, the pork bones were chopped very poorly and there were tiny bone shards throughout the congee.  We ordered this for our little one but there was no way we could give it to her now because there were choking hazards present.  The chow mien was done much better but there must of been only 6 or 7 pieces of chicken altogether in the dish,  We had a little expectations of this place but unfortunately they were not met at all.  I'm hoping this was just a one tie thing but I don't think I will be back to find out if it's true or not."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Casual Cantonese restaurant with rice, noodles, and congee; dinner entrees also offered. Similar to Congee Wong and Chinese \"ABC diners\". Good for quick bite for casual lunch or dinner. We enjoyed it. Also located in a plaza and easy to park."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of restaurants and this is definitely the place to get some of the best Chinese food in Toronto. The service is great with a very friendly manager, Rebecca. Also the price is amazing considering how good the food quality is. Would definitely recommend this place as it is one of my favourite spots in Toronto. Either for take-out or sit-in dinner with the family, Congee Delight is the place to go."}
{"text":"Everything are so good! Will go there again next time. I love crab rice so much. I'll recommend this restaurant to the other friends."}
{"text":"We dropped by this place to get some take out this week. Their food isn't bad. I have tried other restaurants with the name \"congee\" in it. And they all seem to have the same dishes with similar flavours. I secretly suspect there's only one or two chefs at these places cooking all the dishes going from one congee place to another! LOL. I'm just kidding. But seriously now, how is it that all the dishes taste the same with only slight differences in the types of spices used in the dish? E.G., we ordered the fried rice with shrimp, Stir fried Chicken with Cashews & the Rice Noodle Roll with Mushrooms. We've ordered the same dishes at Congee Wong. Tastes EXACTLY the same. As a chef wouldn't you want to put your own personal stamp on the dish, even if there is a standard recipe to follow? I don't know, just things that make you go hmmmmm!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly impressed with the food and service at this location. Affordable, tasty, and quick service - great place for groups and casual family dinners.   Must-orders:  - Crab Soup with Fish Maw (regular size - big enough for 5 people to have at least 2-3 bowls each) - Streaky pork with mui-choi - Seafood with egg tofu  - dry-fried green beans with pork  Our table quickly filled up with food to our surprise. I chose the dishes for my family and everyone was very content with what I ordered. All of it was delicious and I can't wait to be back for another casual dinner! I literally have no negative feedback to give since I'm not sure what I would change or improve.  If you enjoy classic Chinese comfort food, I would recommend this place to a friend. Dare I say it, but I prefer this place to Congee Wong due to their variety and the tastiness of their dishes. Even my bf who is typically not a huge fan of Chinese food was pleasantly surprised and loved the food here (definitely ate his fill)."}
{"text":"Came here late tonight, needing to fill the belly after a Yelp event. Due to the late hour on a Monday night (around 10:15pm), there was no problem getting seating.   FOOD:  The place had pretty standard fare for a congee place. We ordered the Sweet and Sour Vermicelli Noodles, Malaysian Fried Chicken, and a bowl of standard Congee. The noodles were a bit bland in terms of flavoring, but had a fairly good portion of meat, egg, and vegetables mixed in. The fried chicken was what impressed me most - hot, crispy, and nicely-seasoned with some kind of garlic spice.  SERVICE:  It was somewhat annoying how the servers rushed our orders and payment, though it was understandable given the late hour. Other than the rush, the service was friendly and prompt. The food came out surprisingly fast.  SUMMARY:  A good option for a quick and filling late-night bite."}
{"text":"Saturday at 6 and every tables at Congee Delight are occupied.   Good luck if you are a large group without a reservation.  At least as a single diners like me you will feel welcome...as there are couple of small tables that are perfect for a party of 1 or 2.  Shrimp Dumpling Noodle Soup ($4.55) - a little heavy on the MSG... don't drink the soup.. you will regret that - The noodles though have excellent bite - Fresh shrimps and plenty of them in the dumplings went well with the bamboo shoots and the fungus, great texture  Congee Delight's vast menu is great with a big group or anytime of the day!  They accepts Visa and Master Card."}
{"text":"This place reminds of congee wong in terms of the speed that the food comes out. The Cantonese chow mein was really, really good. Perfectly cooked with a lot of meat and veggies. The veggies we got were also well flavoured and kind of fresh. I highly recommend this place as an alternative to congee wong which is almost always packed. The portions are slightly smaller here bit still no worse than average I'd say. Service is frantic as expected."}
{"text":"Restaurant seems some what inconsistent.   This time. Ordered two noodle dishes where it was so bland. Absolutely no salt. I think chef forgot to add salt in both dishes.   Was quickly upsold to their crab fried rice wrapped in lotus leaf.  No prices on menu or mentioned. Until you ask. Then she tells you it's 36 dollars today's.   It tasted alright. Definitely not worth 36 dollars if you ask me. The crab came with what seemed to be garlic butter in the shell which was turned upside down.   Other dishes I have tried here were all pretty standard tasting. Nothing I've ever eaten here have really stood out.   But since the family likes going here. I'll prob be back"}
{"text":"Adorable and good food, friendly staff and very helpful. Ordered the pots and was in big portions and was really delicious. Dessert was amazing with the purple rice pudding."}
