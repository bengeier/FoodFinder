{"text":"I AM BEYOND IMPRESSED.  As a major foodie coming from Southern California for Spring break, I have ate my hearts out around Orange County but this place. This place is something special.   The service was amazing! My glass of water was never empty for more than 1 minute. The server was very informative and helpful. He really knew his cows.   Finally decided on Filet mignon, medium rare. BEST. I Have EVER had. Morton Steakhouse has nothing on this mother Spaceship of a Steakhouse...   I always thought people sounded so stupid when they said meat melted like butter in my mouth until this filet mignon melted in my mouth, LITERALLY like butter. Okay. You get my point.   WHAT THE BUCK ARE YOU WAITING FOR! GOGOO!!! Good luck foodies :) muah xo   PS THE MASH POTATOES ......... #idiedofhappiness"}
{"text":"I have lived in Montreal for 15 years. I can't believe it took me this long to eat the best steak in my life. My mouth is watering just writing about this. I wanted to become a vegetarian for 2016, for my wife. Forget about it, no way, Moishe's is a good reason to remain a carnivore."}
{"text":"Food was great, service good. Only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is it was very very expensive."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Service: 3.5/5 Cleanliness: 4/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Price: $$$  We made our reservation for 2 through Opentable as we usually did. I highly recommend you to make a reservation for your party as Moishes is very popular among locals as well as tourists. If you're coming after 9pm for the late night menu, definitely do yourself a favour and reserve a table!  When you first walk in, there is a staircase that leads you to the second floor, which is essentially the main floor. There is valet parking available, though it was somewhat hard to find as there weren't easy-to-read signs for the parking area. The parking lot, as well as valet parking, is to the back of the restaurant, and it is free if you dine at Moishes.  When you arrive on the second floor, you face their bar and coat check area. There is no bar area inside the dining room. You can probably order a drink while you wait for your table, but since we had a reservation, we didn't have to wait at all.  Moishes is a classic steakhouse, with waiter service, white tablecloth, etc. It really is fine dining, so I don't think babies or toddlers would be appreciated by other customers, though I did see young children with families. Anyway, I really loved the atmosphere! There are separate dining areas? rooms? for bigger tables as such, but for the most part, this is how the dining area looks like.  Our waiter served us a basket of warm bread, Kosher dill pickles, and coleslaw. The pickles and coleslaw were supposed to be eaten with the steak. I noticed that Montreal's L'Express also gave us pickles (cornichons) as well; perhaps this is part of French cuisine? Or is it Québecois culture?  To start off our dinner, I ordered the Alaskan King Crab Cake as an appetizer. I was sad that there was only one crab cake for the price of $21, but King crabs are very expensive, so I suppose that's why. I remember the crab cake being very delicious, and when eaten together with the given potato chips, it was a good duo. The crunchiness of the chip opposed the tender crab meat and so it was balanced out. The crab cake wasn't too overly salty, which was another good point. I recently had a Dungeness crab cake which was too salty so it really left me disappointed.  My hubby ordered the Filet Mignon, a cut of steak you can never go wrong with! Grilled to perfection, I desperately wanted to eat some, but as I wasn't allowed any raw meats, I could only watch my husband eat it...  The steak was served with Moishes' Special Monte Carlo Potato, which was really something unique. It's essentially a double baked potato, where the the insides are scooped out, mashed,  put back in with other veggies, then baked again. With the given coleslaw and pickles, the steak and potato entrée really can't go wrong. Unless they cooked your steak wrong, then perhaps, you know, it may be possible.  As for me, since I couldn't have any raw meat, I decided to try Moishes' special chicken. I wasn't going to order a well-done steak, because in my book, steaks shouldn't be grilled well-done.  Anyway, they called it the special chicken... so how special could it be?  Honestly, I called this the best chicken I've had in Montreal. In fact, my hubby liked this more than his steak! (He loves grilled chicken.) The sauce of the chicken was really something, and I was glad that I had ordered the chicken over the steak. I can't quite put my finger on the secret ingredients of the sauce...but I would sure like to know! The chicken was grilled really well, not too tough and it was just really good.  We skipped dessert, as we were pretty full by this point but we would love to come back for another meal! Not sure when we can...with our baby now, but perhaps for their late After 9 pm menu!  For us, service was okay. Polite, but not too friendly. Our tables were clean, and overall our experience was memorable.  I definitely recommend you try the Sunday Dinner or After 9 pm menu, but arrive early for the late night meal as it's very popular! Be prepared to wait if you arrive after 9pm."}
{"text":"Moishe's is the best steak house in Montreal. Period.   Every person who works there is impeccably trained, and extremely knowledgeable about their menu. Very fast, polite, and with just the right amount of conversation.   This place is old school. A wide open dining room and very nicely furnished. Lots of money in the room (definitely a high roller's place), and every table seems happy, and engaged in great conversation. Nobody ever seems to have a bad night at Moishe's.  I highly recommend trying the pickles, ordering the chopped liver to start, and whatever steak sounds best to you. The NY strip is at the bottom price-wise but is still perfectly done and delicious every time."}
{"text":"This is a great old steakhouse.  The steak was delicious.  Perhaps we went on an off night because they ran out of porterhouse and the steak came out cold.  The steak was really delicious and the service and atmosphere were great so I'm really going to chalk it up to an unlucky night because all the sides were delicious and I really can't complain about anything else.  I would definitely give this place another chance because if you can love it even after eating cold steak, it must be good."}
{"text":"Terrible service, lacklustre food, place is cramped, and ridiculous prices for some items ($8,50 for pineapple??). The only decent thing about this place is the pickles. I know the prices are jacked up because you're essentially paying for the service, but hovering around the table like a nuisance for the first 10 minutes and disappearing until we have to wave you down to clear the plates that have been sitting in front of us for half an hour is not service."}
{"text":"The after 9 menu is really about as good as it gets.  The steak is one of the best I've ever had, the Monte Carlo potato is unbelievably rich and delicious, and the baguette, pickles and coleslaw are perfect (well, almost...the cole slaw is maybe just a little too sugary). But at less than 50$ (with a beer) for top notch food, service, and ambiance, this really is a deal after 9!"}
{"text":"Really good. Complimentary pickles and coleslaw when you sit down - best I've ever had. I had the Moishes special chicken, really garlicky grilled chicken, huge serving and yummy. Can't wait to come back to montreal and eat at Moishes again."}
{"text":"Moishes was recommended by our hotel staff so we gave it a try. Don't get me wrong, my steak, and my wife's prime rib were great. As was the Monte Carlo Potato and other sides we tried.  My issue, as discussed in other reviews was the noise. The interior construction (brick walls and a very cool hammered metal ceiling) along with the closeness of the tables just make it worse.  When got there it was about 1/3 full but the David the manager put my wife and I right next to a party of about ten with very young children who were obviously tired and hungry. Poor placement on his part and I should have asked to move. My bad I guess.  We spent about $250ca for dinner with the meal and wine. It was good, don't get me wrong. But I will not be back on our next trip."}
{"text":"We took from their dry aged menu, the porterhouse for two at 150$. It was for our 11th anniversary. One side of the steak was a filet mignon and the other a sirloin. We ordered it medium rare and it was out of this world amazing with a good red wine! The taste melts in your mouth. A must try!!! We also ordered their mille feuille. Was the best mille feuille i ever had! All worth the while!!! I never remember waiters name but i remember this one. Marven. Best waiter we ever had. Will come back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I came here as a young little kid with my uncle Peter in the 60s from the back door in those days he was a regular, knew the original family and he intoduced me to food decadence ,unlike the restaurants he and my dad owned in Montreal that were on the faster side luncheonettes and Diners ,Uncle Peter and I went there up until the late 70s when I would go with my dates and even my first wife.  This place is a classic and I remember being schooled in the art of the Maitre D ,there was no room for error because if there was a glitch it would be fixed ,fast with I am sorries and quick replacements. Ah What a place the last  time I went there was with good old Jim S and Nico with some dates in 97 and Red Fisher of the old Montreal Star and at that time the Gazette came over as he new Jim and told us that we were the best decorated table he ever saw at Moishes . I had my usual T bone steak rare and a bunch of apps. I look forward to coming into Montreal again 1 day ,perhaps I will go to Moishes,maybe I will go with Angelo if his wife lets him. ,,true story,."}
{"text":"Proper old school steak house atmosphere.  Loud enough atmosphere wise but not because they're blasting music out the speakers. Just a vibrant ambiance.   Waiter was excellent. Knew his shit and got the job done well. the rest of the wait staff were excellent also.   Severs accidentally swapped my dish with my gf's (here's was the Filet Mignon rare, mines med rare).  I tasted it rare and it was phenomenal.  Medium rare it was still excellent but she asked to swap to what we actually ordered so I had the med rare, it was still great but I preferred the rare. It was cooked to perfection.   Sides where the special twice baked potatoes. Cant recall the name on the menu for them but they were absolutely excellent.   Overall, fantastic.  Definitely recommended and if we're back in Montreal, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Famed as the top steak house in Montreal it walks the talk. My boyfriend and I did not have reservations and were pretty late upon arrival but took our chance going in.  Tip: do put your name down on the waiting list even though the hostess says its an hour. We waited 15 min (reservations strongly recommended for large groups) . They're fast with their turn over.  * go after 9pm if you 'd like a great menu at fraction of the cost $25 app, entre and coffee/Tea. For birthdays they bring a slice of chocolate cake .  * take the pickles and coleslaw home (if there are any left) hey have best pickles and coleslaw as part of the table starters (mainstay and something they sell in house). Our waiter was super helpful and it was upon his suggestion .  * I chose salmon tartare (small but really tasty dish) and petit fillet (smaller filet mignon but plenty for a person who can't stomach too big of portions)  My partner had the rib steak .... Really tasty and juicy with a Cesar salad.  Ambience--- old school steakhouse 1938. , a bit noisy but worth the experience.   We will definitely be back maybe arriving a bit earlier during their regular menu hour and with reservations (don't want to chance it) . The regular menu contains items that are not on the 9- midnight one."}
{"text":"I completely understand why this place is such an institution. After missing the reservation at another restaurant, we decided to come to Moishe's on a Friday night even though we did not have a reservation. Thankfully, there was a table for two available and we were seated right away.   The vibe in the restaurant just screams old school class minus the fussy.Our server was amazing. Since we weren't too hungry, we asked for the filet mignon to be half portions and he did that beautifully. We also got the chopped liver and monte carlo potatoes to share. They give you a lot of food to start so if you don't have a huge appetite, I'd suggest half portioning the steaks like we did so that you can be perfectly stuffed.   I'm definitely looking forward to trying their dry-aged steaks next time."}
{"text":"We did their dinner special, three course meal for a set price. I had their salmon appetizer which I was actually not a fan off, the sauce on the salmon was very sweet and tangy it almost tasted like cheap chinese food orange chicken sauce. The filet mignon I had did change everything though it was amazing. So if you're going there, just stick to the steak."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Its my favorite steakhouse in Montreal.   I love the food, I love the no fills atmosphere, I love the pickles on the table. This place has been around 1938 and you can tell why."}
{"text":"amazing coleslaw i ordered the rib steak and it was missing flavor ....tried gibbys last week and it was the best rib steak i ever had :)"}
{"text":"So, last night was our last chance for  new gastronomic experiences in Montreal.  On the recommendation of Adrien from Robin's Montreal office, we went to Moishes' Steak House on St-Laurent. A true \"old world\" experience. Let's start with our server Frank, who has been serving there for 52 years. Wood panelled walls, tin ceiling and leather chairs all add up to a traditional \"old boys club\" feel to the place. Maybe not for everyone, but I kind of liked the vibe. A pair of shared appetizers of traditional Caesar salad (quite good) and a truly amazing Salmon Tartare had us feeling quite excited about what was to come.  Things then turned a bit rocky with Robin's blue rare steak coming out more rare, than blue. Frank immediately offered to have a new one prepared, but we declined as that would mean I'd be eating on my own, and would likely be done by the time Robin had hers back. The manager David came right over. He immediately whisked away both our meals, and all the sides and had them start from scratch for both of us on everything. Not something we asked for or expected. However, we truly appreciated it as when the replacements came out, everything was perfect.  Every organization and service provider can mess up occasionally, but it's how those mistakes are dealt with that that in my opinion, set the real tone.  Frank, thanks for your wonderful service. David, thanks for ensuring we had a truly enjoyable meal.  We won't hesitate to come back, or to recommend you to our friends."}
{"text":"I recently received Moishe's gift certificate for as a Christmas gift.  And to be totally honest I thought Moishe's was a smoke meat joint! I had no idea they are a high end steak house!  Went with my girlfriend and we enjoyed their amazing  steak / coleslaw.   The only reason why I didn't give them 5 stars is because they are a little pricey for my cheap ass!"}
{"text":"this was a great experience  but very pricey   recommended by our concierge and he was right    the cuts of meat were perfect    prepared as requested  everything is a la carte  sauce for the shrimp was a little bland  rye bread with seeds reminded me of a good rye from a philly deli  key lime pie was green and not great  chocolate cake was so light and fluffy   good wine selection   wish i had known about the inexpensive fixed price menu  staff was attentive  remember no free soda refills"}
{"text":"LE steak house version GÉNIAL ! Service, ambiance, carte, vins,... En prime, les cornichons : le régal version Moishes ! À consommer sans modération, sauf pour le vin bien entendu. Petit conseil de Yelper : choisissez le plus gros morceau de la carte, la cuisson est encore mieux réalisée sur les grosses pièces. Raison de plus de se faire plaisir ! En bref et en conclusion : on y va et on y retourne."}
{"text":"Incredible steak!!  Unfortunately the wine menu was depleted and we had to select three bottles before our waiter confirmed that our third choice was available. The appetizers were ok but perhaps a bit heavy: chopped liver and caprese salad to share between two people. Then the steaks came: the rib steak and the rib eye, and boy were we blown away! Amazing flavor and tenderness, possibly the best steak I ever had. We did not order desert since we were stuffed. The service was relaxed and efficient and the atmosphere was great. The decor is not trendy but has its own style, a classic steak house setting with interesting elements. I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Moishe's Steak House had amazing food, and a classy ambiance that we really wanted for the main night of my best friend's bachelor party.  From my point of view, the restaurant was a 5, based on the incredible cuts of meat and exceptional service.  On the other side of the table though, the seating was very tight, and two of my friends had their chairs bumped all night by everyone that passed.  The wine list was extensive but overpriced, but the attentive service made up for it.  Definitely order the Monte Carlo potato instead of the French Fries - trust me.  We had a great experience at Moishe's but I would say it would have been a different experience on a date night.  It's definitely a great upscale choice for a 'guys night out'."}
{"text":"BEST steak in town!!!! The creme brullee is amazing   everytime we go its the exact same thing , I love it so for a good steak & a night out go to this plsce!"}
{"text":"If you have a costco membership, i'd recommend to go there and get the gift certificate card. It will help you save around 15 $ if I recall. So we were a group of 10 people and we went there on a sunday night. I was surprised that even on a sunday night, it was quite busy. Right after we sat down, we were welcomed with a basket filled with warm breads and butter on the side, with pickles and cole slaw. Everything was great. We even asked for a refill and they didn't charge us extra~ I ordered the salmon tartare and also the beet salad to start, and to be honest, it wasn't really impressive, so skip the entrees...since they weren't that appealing. As for our main courses, my boyfriend and I ordered the lamb chops and he ordered the 45 days old steak which was pretty juicy. We also ordered the double baked potato and it was heavenly good. The lamb chops were tender and they brought out this mushroom sauce on the side that you can put on your lamb chops if needed. I got the chance to try the filet mignon poutine and it was something that is worth its price! As for desserts, we got the mille-feuille and it was way too big for one person. It's definitely a dessert that needs to be shared with 1-2 other people, but it was good. My friend ordered the lime tarte and i had the chance to taste it, it was good and not too sweet. Really creamy too.   The waiter was really attentive and was nice to us although we came in late and they kept refilling our glasses and ask us if everything was alright. Usually, when we are in a big group, we tend to get ignored, but the waiters were always keeping an eye on us."}
{"text":"Whoever thinks this is the best steakhouse they've ever been to must live in Antarctica, because this place flatout sucks the bell-end. Moishe's is the classic paradigm of a restaurant running on the fumes of the reputation it once enjoyed eons ago in it's remote, cobwebbed heyday.  First of all, it's run out of a moldy second floor 1920's era building with knob and tube electrical wiring and dim, eye-searing light fixtures. The carpets haven't been changed since horses and buggies ruled St. Laurent. However, the wood panelling is delightful and the waitstaff is definitely trained to be as professional as possible.   The food? Whatever - nothing to see here, move along. I won't even bother with a description, it's just average run of the mill steak. Anyways, what the hell am I doing, writing a review for this place? Do yourself a favor - add another $100 to the budget and head over to Qeue de Cheval on Rene Levesque."}
{"text":"I've been going to Moishe's on and off for 18 years. Some of my best memories dining out in Montreal center around eating at Moishe's. Amazing service and the waiters never make a mistake! The after 9 pm menu is arguably the best deal in the city in terms of quality for price. My family and friends and I have never had a bad meal or experience here. Parking is never a problem here as there is a fully staffed parking lot out back. Next time you're at the grocery store try out their cole slaw!"}
{"text":"Great steak and sides ! If u love steak it's the place to go!!! Service was good ! She was nice and had great smile. Will come back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Nous étions trois nous y sommes allés un samedi soir réservation obligatoire après 21h le judi vendredi et samedi il t a un spécial sur le menu qui n est pas négligeable 25$ pour une better plat et café pour la première dans ce restau moi amatrice de viande rouge mais qu'elle celle surprise un vrai délice pas cher vraiment de la qualité délicieux un service irréprochable et cerise sur le gâteau un stationnement gratuit vraiment que du bonheur je sais maintenant ou aller pour la meilleure pièce de viande à Montréal merci moishe's"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Moishe's since I was a kid. It was our go-to family restaurant in the 70s and 80s. The decor has been updated and the waiters are as professional as they come. This is not a fancy restaurant, be comfortable. The portions are a good size so don't fill up on the pickles & cole slaw though you will be tempted to!  I always get a half-order of boiled verenikes as an appetizer before my baby shish-kebab. (The best marinated filet mignon on the planet.)  On a recent trip with a Moishe's n00b, we were offered a selection of special dry-aged meats. The regular menu was perfect, so I didn't try and my n00bie friend enjoyed his regular rib steak to the point where I had to stop him from ripping the bone in two.  We were there as soon as they opened at 5 because we had to make a 7 pm show down the street and we had plenty of time to enjoy our meal but chose to skip dessert.  Sure, it's expensive but for the price, you get time-tested quality, experienced staff that won't rush around without seeing you and won't get your order wrong. I still love going there but now that I pay the bill, I prefer to keep it for special occasions when I need to know what to expect!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for Valentine's Day dinner. My locally sourced 60$ rib steak was dry and tough. Her shrimp dish was so bad she actually laughed out loud. Luckily we live together, so I'll see her again. Can't say the same for Moishe's."}
{"text":"In Montreal for the weekend, we were looking for dining recommendations.   A coworker recommended Moishe's Steak House.  I think, but we're in Montreal, shouldn't we be dining on crepes and poutine?  Nonetheless, we made an 8 pm reservation for Friday night...one of the best meals I think I have ever had!  We were greeted by someone opening the door as we headed upstairs to be seated.  It felt like we were transplanted into a different time.  Old-school charm, dark wood interior, great, unobtrusive service.  We were seated immediately and greeted by plate of whole pickles, fresh bread (rye, and french and another kind), and a coleslaw.  They had me at the pickles.  My taste buds did a happy dance as we studied the menu for our entrees.  We had different cuts of meat and they were all cooked PERFECTLY and had the best flavor EVER.  I had the steak frites and it was amazing.  My husband had the filet which came with a double baked potato (which was really mashed potatoes, unbelievable!)  We washed it all down with some Grey Goose cocktails.  It was definitely pricey (3 Grey Goose cocktails = $45...) but SO worth it!  Next time we find ourselves in Montreal, we will undoubtedly re-visit."}
{"text":"Great service & food. Try the filet mignon poutine!"}
{"text":"Went for the $25 menu and was delighted! Had the fillet and dinner companion had the rib steak.  Absolute PERFECTION.  If you want some drinks be prepared to spend some cash.   If you can do without you cannot get a better deal on gorgeous meat.   It was just delicious.  Really enjoyed the pickles and slaw and their salmon tatare was great.  next on my list is going the be the chopped liver and lamb!!  Please take yourself there after 9 on the weekends."}
{"text":"Too many tables were crammed into the dining area.  You literally cannot walk to your table because the tables are jammed in this place so tightly.  Expect to be bumping into people at adjacent tables throughout your meal.  Steak - wet-aged, not prime (or AAA whatever in canada).  On par with Costco steaks (which I enjoy very much, but not for $50+)  Really over-rated steakhouse that must have been amazing in its hey-day, but now just tries to jam as many diners in as possible and offers mediocre food."}
{"text":"Been coming to Moises for the past 32 years. What is amazing is how consistent the food is. I no longer live in Montreal but every time I come back into town the food tastes exactly the way I remember. My favorite steak house in Montreal and a great experience if you have not been."}
{"text":"Le meilleur steakhouse en ville selon moi. Un menu délicieux et une viande cuite àa la perfection. Leur pommes de terre Monte Carlo à elles seules en valent le détour. Amateurs de frites ou de pommes de terre au four, vous êtes servis! Le nouveau menu après 21h offre un excellent rapport qualité prix."}
{"text":"Supermarket steak at best. Chopped salad loaded with salt and otherwise tasteless. Dining room resembles a borscht belt resort during the 1960's so forget any attempt at conversation. Anyone who believes this place is a steakhouse never dined at The Palm, Sparks or Peter Luger. Can't help but notice that most of the 5 star reviews are from 30 somethings or under, enough said."}
{"text":"I've ate dinner at Moishes on two separate occasions. My first experience was excellent as far as the food and service were concerned, however my experience  left me less than impressed and rather annoyed.  During my second visit to the restaurant I was part of a large group (10 or more people) which included some guests from out of town including myself and my husband. From the time we arrived, we were treated very poorly by the staff compared to others who were there for dinner.  Our server did not check in to see if we required a drink refill etc. I believe if you're spending that type of money you expect a certain level of service. It seemed as though the staff were trying to rush us out, I had to ask 3 times to order dessert. The waiter was trying to rush our party to pay even though we weren't even finished our meals or desserts.   I was not impressed whatsoever and neither were any of our friends. We have all had dinner at comparable establishments and have never experienced this type of lack of service or care."}
{"text":"Meh... We were seated 30 minutes past our reservation time. They were out of the item we wanted. Steak was good, monte carlo potato a disappointment. Glad we checked it out, but won't be going back."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, ambiance, and service... just not sure it was worth the price tag."}
{"text":"I've been going to Moishe's since I was a baby. I know it is a steakhouse, but I always love to get a half order of the special chicken, which is always really yummy. A few years back they finally added windows in the front, which really adds to the place, especially in the summer. When you leave you get a handful of hubbabubba gum too! I usually hate coleslaw and pickles, but can't get enough of it at Moishe's."}
{"text":"Que dire de cette institution... Reconnue pour leur steak qui suit à sa réputation avec l'accompagnement de salade de choux et cornichon délicieuses. Les prix sont un peu dispendieux mais leur spécial de menu de fin de soirée en vaut la peine!"}
{"text":"Out of all the most famous steak house I've been, this is my favorite for many reason like the fact that they do not ask you what kind of water you want but they bring you water, they also have a little filet on the menu for ladies:) and there coffee are served in hot cup. The meat is delicious and service proper and and you can tell the history and profesionnel staff is also a part of a good steakhouse experience."}
{"text":"This is one of the \"Essentials\" of Montreal. I mean, this is arguably one of the best meal experiences you will ever have.  While an expensive restaurant in itself - it has the $25 fixed price menu, which can include Steak Frites or the Rib-Eye - available from Thursday to Sunday past 9PM. You get unlimited pickles/coleslaw/bread, but dont fill up on those as the steak is a marvel.  Nothing more to say - just go have it. The place is a bit crowded, but that shows it is a good place. It has the old ambiance, almost Mafia-style type of place, where I can see Al Capone type of mobsters wearing coats and hats walking in and enjoying a steak. The tables are the old original ones in the restaurant.  Service is a bit snooty (esp for the \"poor\" people that are having the cheap menu) - but who cares. I am there to stuff my face with a delicious steak and not to have a fun conversation with the waiter. Ours wasn't the best guy, but my food was delivered promptly, pickles/coleslaw/water glass always got replenished and never had an issue with anything.  If you decide to go for the $25 menu - it doesn't include wine. The cheapest glass is like $15 or something, so that can add heavily to the cost. But hey, whats a steak with no wine???  Fantastic place, excellent atmosphere, will always come back."}
{"text":"As far as the various complaining reviews here on Yelp?  C'mon! Do you REALLY believe that Moishe's, the legendary institution of carnivorous consumption that it is/was/always will be, has not had more than its share of complaining in the past 70+ years???    Haters hate Whiners whine Moishe's pumps out beef that is consistently fine.  This is the original OJG deal making dynastic den of dining. Its worth a visit from a historical perspective if nothing else.     Quite simply, a great place to consume meat in a city that still celebrates steak.  Not even remotely trendy or faddish, just come for the beef."}
{"text":"Came last October with the boys for steak night. Great service, pickles, sides, wine, and steak! An old fashioned steakhouse that does it right everytime. I will visit again when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Excellent traditional atmosphere, great menu.  The \"after 9\" menu is insanely good value.  Brought a group of six here for dinner and everybody loved it."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in, you can sense that this is the \"real deal\" and that you are in for a treat.  We were greeted by David Zaltzman, the general manager, shown to a lovely table and personally assisted by him. David personifies hospitality industry professionals.  Everything at this Montreal institution is top-notch and while expensive, reasonable for the quality, service, ambiance and portion size.  Everything we ordered, from the caesar salad and salmon tartare to the rib eye, onion strips and grilled asparagus, was more than enough for two and maybe three diners. Don't miss the cole slaw.  I  have tried to buy the cole slaw in US but apparently not available.  Moishes is what steak houses use to be but sadly are no more.  Other than perhaps Peter Luger's in NYC, this may be the best steak house we have experienced in about 40 years.  Obviously Montreal natives agree, judging from the crowds and families celebrating special occasions or just enjoying being together.  Our daughter from Boston recommended it and we are so glad she did."}
{"text":"While Moishe's does not need any more great reviews, I felt compelled to say something. The first time I ate at Moishe's was on my 27th birthday, and also the day I got engaged. We have been married for almost 52 years, and we still go to Moishe's for any special occasion, sometimes because one of us loses a bet, or whatever reason. We have gone there with many people who are no longer with us, we have laughed and cried there, and every time we go there we feel we are at a favourite relative's place. We feel comfortable. The food is superb, the steaks are well flavoured and generous as are the other excellent dishes they serve. The service is dignified, yet friendly and warm. In the half century we have been going there, only once have I sent back an overdone steak, and the problem was rectified in record time. Over time there have been changes, of course, but frankly always for the better. Thank you Moishe's staff and management."}
{"text":"A few years ago when I had a job with an expense account, I stopped at Moishe's for a late lunch in a driving rainstorm after my final sales call.  If you like restaurants that bring you back to yesteryear, this is your place.  From the paneled walls to the old-school waiters, the place oozes with history.    Now the food itself was not the best I have had ever tried, but it was quite good and because it was a slow day, I did not feel pressured to leave except that I had a plane to catch!  And as others have noted the pickles and breads they bring are great.   Would I go when not on an expense account?  It might depend on the exchange rate but it is worth at least one visit when you are next in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I visited Montreal on the coldest weekend of the year. It was snowing when I jumped into a cab and started chatting with the driver. He gave me a number of great tips and mentioned he had worked at Moishe's for years and that I have to go there.  So on my last night in town I took up his advice. The atmosphere is very classy and upscale. The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating.  They start you off with coleslaw, bread & butter, and some of the tastiest pickles I've ever had. I ordered the filet carpaccio to start with. It was nice but probably my least favorite part of the meal.  I had a rib steak medium rare. The steak was delicious and cooked perfectly fine. I finished the entire meal in under 30 minutes and left in perfect satisfaction.  Moishe's is an area staple. If you're in the mood for a great steak in Montreal I would recommend it."}
{"text":"It was our first time in Montreal and I am so glad we went to Moishe's for dinner. When we first walked in we were greeted by a gracious maitre d, David. While walking us over to the table we started to chat about our plans for our few days in Montreal. Before he walked away he promised to be back with a full list of \"local\" inspired restaurants and activities for our weekend. He certainly delivered - David brought over a list that was spot on and ended up making our trip even better! It was such a pleasure getting to meet David - as he not only helped inspire our weekend plans, but he also made our dining experience even more special.   As for the food at Moishe's, to start our meal each table is served cole slaw and pickles (of course reminding me of Ben's Deli in New York) which I certainly loved! For dinner we shared the marinated salmon appetizer, which they split in the kitchen for us, and we each had steak (cooked perfectly). We also really enjoyed a special side dish (grilled garlic scraps - the flower bud of the garlic plant) that is only in season for a few months that our server made sure to mention.   Our overall experience at Moishe's was top notch, thanks to the service and food, and we can see why it has been around for so long. I would absolutely recommend Moishe's for a great steakhouse dinner."}
{"text":"J'avais souvent passé les belles portes vitrées sur le boulevard Saint-Laurent, avec l'inscription Moishes, sans vraiment en penser plus.  Bien que je connaissais le restaurant, je ne l'avais jamais essayé, et dans ma tête, c'était pour \" des vieux riches \".  Étant donné que je ne suis ni riche, ni veille, j'étais un peu surprise quand des amis ont proposé d'y amener mon chum et moi comme remerciement  pour des services que mon chum les a rendus.    Et qu'une bonne surprise!  Nous avons pris avantage du menu après 21h, et c'était fantastique!  C'est certain que j'y retournerai pour en essayer d'autres plats, parce que cette qualité à ce prix, c'est très très bien (et non seulement quand quelqu'un d'autre paie).  J'ai bien aimé les cornichons, salade de choux et pain servi au début du repas.  Comme c'était déjà passé 21h, nous avions tous faim et c'était apprécié.  J'ai commandé le tartare de saumon, et je l'ai trouvé très bien.  Bien qu'il soit servi avec un morceau de citron, il n'en a pas besoin.  Ensuite j'ai commandé un bon rib steak cuit medium avec une pomme de terre Monte-Carlo en accompagnement.  C'était délicieux!  J'ai apprécié le fait qu'ils apportent automatiquement du ketchup ainsi que du HP (steak sauce) à la table sans même vous demander.  Le décor est superbe et chaleureux, briques rouges et grandes fenêtres donnant sur Saint-Laurent.  J'ai bien aimé les photos noires et blancs des employées accrochées aux murs. Le service était correct, mais pas excellente, surtout en regardant la façon que le serveur jasé avec les autres tables.  Peut-être c'est parce que la moyenne d'âge dans la salle était dans les environs de 50 or 60 ans, pendant que nous sommes tous aux alentours de 30 ans.  Peu importe, c'était correct, et même beaucoup mieux que d'autres restaurants."}
{"text":"Went here for my bf's 30th bday to try steak for the first time after seing so many good reviews! Good comfort food and best service ever. Filet mignon was amazing!! Nice decor also"}
{"text":"They say that this place has been rated as one of the top 10 steak houses in North America and I can see why.   From the moment you walk in until you leave the service is excellent. Great care is taken to be sure your experience is perfect. The decor and atmosphere is exactly what you'd expect from a high end, old school steakhouse.   The steaks are what you come for. I had hands down the best bone in filet that I've ever had. It was cooked to absolute perfection and bursting with flavor. The sides are massive so definitely share. The wine list is impressive and not overpriced as you might expect in similar places. Get the Monte Carlo potato, it is spectacular.  This is the perfect place for a business dinner or a romantic evening on the town. If you get a chance to eat here be sure you do, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Moishe's is a steakhouse that is bigger than the food and because the food is terrific they get a 5 star rating. A Montreal landmark and part of the city's history. Go for the Thursday night special after 9:00 PM (reserve a few days in advance to get a reservation close to or at 9) and get the Rib Steak or Moishe's Special Chicken. Don't mess around with that gimmicky filet mignon poutine stuff. Try the chopped liver if as an appetizer if you're into that and try not fill up on coleslaw, pickles, and bread. The best on table freebie combo out of any steakhouse I've been to. Oh, and get a Shirley Temple."}
{"text":"I've eaten at some of the best steakhouses North America and Europe have to offer and the 45 Day Aged Ribeye was arguably the best cut of meat I've ever been served.  Seared and cooked to perfection, the expertly aged meat had a little bit of that \"funky\" aged bite on it when you were eating it and it had a tender/juicy texture to it that was unmatched..  Not sure how it was prepared but there was a wonderful salty crust to the outside (beautiful char) and the moist meat between was just beyond what I thought was possible with beef.  We served it up with some Grand Crux Bordeaux from the Pauillac region and I don't think anyone said anything other than \"wow\" for a solid 15 minutes after the food hit the table... seriously it has been about two months and everyone is still talking about it.  As for the rest of the restaurant, compared to other places of this caliber I feel like some people would be unimpressed, you may feel like they fell a little short with the jam-packed crowd and relatively modest offerings for sides.  Me personally, it's all about the beef so I could care less if it was a leather-bound cigar lounge at the top of the tallest tower in the biggest city, or a country barn renovated into a restaurant on the side of an old highway... the beef is where it's at!  If you're a steak lover, then this is a must stop... not to be missed if you're in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Moishe's, I hate to say this, I wanted to love you like I did 10 years ago when I last ate at your restaurant, but sadly I was disappointed.   The room and ambience is great, sides were ok but my meat was just so-so and the waiter got my order wrong (my dining companion asked for medium, me for rare but seeing as we got different cuts of beef we couldn't simply switch and I don't believe in throwing out food so I ate it anyway). At the end of the day I come to a restaurant for the food and after this meal I think this will unfortunately be my last visit.   Please, bring back the quality of the Moishe's I fondly remember."}
{"text":"Come experience this place with the 'after 9 menu' for 25$ where you get an appetizer and main dish. Get the rib bone steak. I'm not going to lie this is a very good steak! May not be the best ever but I very much enjoyed it. You get bread, coleslaw and picked on the side which is a great appetizer. Service is classy, accommodating and friendly. Atmosphere is classy and like a typical steak house."}
{"text":"Moishe's oh Moishe's...I'm so conflicted about this steakhouse. Is the food good? Yes, it's ok. Is the service good? It's also ok (but some of the staff have a big attitude problem on them). Is the price ok? Not really. For the food and service you get, you shouldn't have to spend what you do on this place. I don't know guys...there are lots of other excellent steakhouses in the city at this price point...not sure what is so special here (been 3 times by the way, so this review isn't based on a one time visit). All in all, Moishe's is A-OK. Nothing great, and nothing bad..just average."}
{"text":"We went here specifically for the after 9pm special, which turned out to be a good choice. The space is very large and decorated appropriately for an historic steak house. We were seated on time, and our waiter(s) were efficient and generally very helpful. Over time, the restaurant filled up very quickly and, as a result, became very noisy. We each had the cesar salad, which was very tasty and a really good portion size. We had the steak frites and the rib eye. Both of the steaks were perfectly cooked to our liking (medium-well and medium rare, respectively). While the steaks were pretty much perfect, the french fries were very overcooked and almost impossible to eat. We did have the French onions though, which weren't bad at all. For drinks, we each had a martini, which was very strong, and very good. All in all, we had a great evening and thoroughly enjoyed our steaks. We'd definitely go back for the after 9pm menu."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I went to Moishe's to celebrate our recent engagement and as such had high hopes. A travel agent had recommended this restaurant to us and we thought \"why not, looks pretty good.\"  The setting is certainly very interesting. The restaurant has clearly been there for a while and enjoyed a great reputation. Unfortunately, that evening it didn't live up to that reputation.  I'm a big steak guy, and my fiancee enjoys a cut every now and then as well. I ordered the dry aged ribeye and she had the filet mignon. The filet mignon arrived and had the texture of pate, no joke, it was very dry and tasted awful.. to the point where it put me off my ribeye after I tried it. The ribeye was a slightly better but no better than something you can get at an Outback steakhouse. There was no flavor and the meat was very stringy, not a good cut.  I've got no comment on the sides given the above. We sent the filet back and I ate half the ribeye (which never happens). If you can laugh off spending $300 then be my guest, I certainly would think twice about going back to risk another try."}
{"text":"I've literally tried everything there. Delightful experience each time and can't wait to go back again. Their lamb is to die for !"}
{"text":"Thursday, Friday and Saturday you have to try their reduced price menu for after 9 pm dining.  All of the amazing quality Moishe's is famous for, at such reasonable prices.  There have been stretches of time i hvae eaten there every Thursday for 3 months straight. Just can't get enough!  And the service is excellent too!"}
{"text":"What a great steakhouse. My girlfriend and I made reservations for 9 p.m. on a Friday night, to try their after 9 menu. We were excited, as we were going to get a good meal in a nice steakhouse for an amazing price. For those unaware, the after 9 menu gives you a choice of appetizer, a main (including a couple of steaks to choose from) and coffee/tea for $25. Outstanding.  We got there a little bit after nine, and there was a short wait in their lounge. We were seated in about five minutes. Their tables are fairly close to each other though, so for those who like a bit more space, you've been warned. Our server promptly asked us if we wanted drinks, and I ordered a Manhattan.   Both of us went with the late night menu, she got the caesar salad to start and a rib steak for the main, and I got the salmon tartar and a rib steak as well (I've heard amazing things about their rib steak). Both of us got it medium rare. Shortly after that, we were served bread, pickles, and a heaping mound of coleslaw. The bread was delicious (two different types) and the coleslaw was the perfect pre-dinner snack. We shared a pickle as well.  Our appetizers came out quickly, and both were good. The salmon tartar was excellent. The steaks arrived soon after and we both dug in. I really enjoyed mine, the seasoning was great. My girlfriend found hers a bit too rare for her liking (both of ours were the same temperature) but I'm not too fussed about it being a bit rare. She raised it with the waiter who promptly brought it back to the kitchen to grill for a little longer. The waiter was fantastic, double checking with me to make sure I was absolutely okay with mine.  We were full after our meal, and finished the night with two cups of decaf. All in all, their after 9 menu is an incredible value and the service we received was top notch. I was a bit worried that we'd get slightly sloppier service because we were ordering off the \"cheap\" menu, but that never happened. I really enjoyed my experience here."}
{"text":"The idea of going to Moishe's after my midterm today suddenly came to me. Therefore I reserved on opentable for one person at 9:00pm. I was impressed by the environment when I got there. I'm not joking; this place reminded me of Mad men's time. The decoration, the service, the way people talked and ate, all reminded me of that play. I ordered salmon tartare and rib steak. As soon as I sat down, coleslaw, pickles and bread were served. I am not a fan of their pickles, but the coleslaw was very sour and I love sour coleslaw! The bread was okay, nothing special. The salmon was okay. I really like the rib steak! The portion was huge, and the steak was juicy and delicious! I was very full even if I came with an empty stomach. I was glad that I did not order any sides. However, I heard the Monte Carlo potato was super good. I will definitely come next time and try it out. I really missed the atmosphere there, even after I got home."}
{"text":"pros: the after 9 menu is a really good deal (appetizer + main course + coffee for 25$ + tax+tip) the coleslaw, pickles, bread and butter are excellent and promptly refilled on demand the salmon tartare is nice  cons: cook on the steak is inconsistent. The first time, I ordered medium rare and it arrived medium-well, so thinking this steakhouse has different standards, I ordered rare when I came back. The rare steak ended up being almost raw all the way. Every time I came here we had a reservation and we still had to wait quite a long time. The most we had to wait was around 45 minutes."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night. It was our second time eating at Moishes, and the place had been remodeled since the last time we were there about a decade ago. It looks like the inside of a casino. Wall-to-wall carpet, glass chandeliers, wood paneling. The tables are packed in, and the place was full to the gills on Friday night. It was fairly raucous. The ambiance is not unpleasant; it's just very lively. Perfect for people watching.   They seat you and bring bread, good coleslaw and pickles right away, which is nice. We ordered the shrimp cocktail, a ribeye and a porterhouse, fries, a Montecarlo potato and mushrooms. The sides were tasty. The steaks were not. Good quality meat, but it was bland, under spiced, grey on the outside instead of charbroiled. Weirdly enough, Moishes actually sells a brand of steak spice, but there was no evidence of it being used in the restaurant. My ribeye arrived medium instead of medium rare, which is kinda unforgivable at a place specializing in steak. They don't age most of their beef---too bad, because it would be a lot more flavorful. We finished with dessert. The chocolate cake was great; the banana cream pie, not so much (it had a weird, artificial taste and colour).   As for the service, it was good. Kind, attentive and efficient. Overall, we had a good time, but it had more to do with the good company than the food. We probably won't be back for another decade."}
{"text":"I had the rib eye which was good. The spinach was made with too much butter for my liking, but the overall experience was solid."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night with 6 adults and we had an average experience and given that there are so many great places to eat in Montreal, I won't go here again.  Good points: the sides are great when you get to the table, fresh bread, coleslaw and pickles; the potatoe latkas were outstanding; and we loved our dessert.  Bad points: very slow service-our waiter forgot to bring one side we ordered-we never got it-forgot to bring us drinks and we needed to find him to order other drinks.  Two members of our party ordered the same cut-rib eye. One cut was buttery and great the other cut was below average.  My husband ordered lobster rolls and shrimp cocktail-below average and the roll was very small for $19.  I think this place is past its prime."}
{"text":"One of the best steaks I have ever had in my life.   I went to Moishe's about a year ago in the coldest winter night I have ever experienced. Although it was freezing, Moishe's had a warm log cabin atmosphere. We had the after 9 menu, which includes an appetizer, main course, coffee/ tea for $25. For a restaurant of this caliber, that is a very good deal. The cole slaw (which I don't even like cole slaw) was amazing. The steak was perfectly cooked how I like it. And the selection of wine was awesome. Every dollar I spent at Moishe's was worth it. I just made a reservation to eat a Moishe's next Saturday. As such, I am super excited."}
{"text":"Thank God for their $25 3 course late night menu! I'm a night owl to begin with, so this is perfect for me.  I had heard grumbles before that the clientele was snobby and looked down on certain others, I can definitely imagine this is the kind of place that gentlemen were asked to wear a suit and tie to dine here in the olden days.  The cheap menu is going to bring a different clientele i can kind of blend into, so it works on so many levels.  Their regular steaks are in the $40-50 range, chicken and fish is slightly below, the sides are an extra $5.  First nice touch: complementary pickles and coleslaw, normally not a fan of slaw, but this one was the best I've ever had. The baguette was also quite good.   I had the chopped liver, tiny scoop with fried onions, very delicious but small in size.  Onto the rib steak, the fat is so succulent you will eat it up, do not leave it on the plate, that would be a tragedy. The piece was about10oz in size, so decent, it comes with a decadent Monte Carlo Potato.  My friend got the Kobe Burger, it was good, but M:Brgr does it better,  Our meal comes with coffee or tea, but no dessert.  Dessert was the main drawback, No Millefeuille, no Cheesecake, No Tarte Tatin, so our fourth choice was Panna Cota and Chocolate Cake ($12 each) The price is just too high and the desserts were just ok, but i guess they need to make their money back somehow.   The setting is very upscale masculine, people are loud, but that's OK, I like the fact we had a nice table by the window. The service is curt, competent but not overly polite.  Their late night menu is tantalizing, and I would love to try every item on there."}
{"text":"This steakhouse really shows its age, in a sad way. Food and service are overrated. Tourists may still go there, along with people who equate dull with reassuring.  Do avoid, unless you're invited or dating the wrong person."}
{"text":"Pretty good ambience and the crowd was great. The service was good, chicken was okaish but the steak was good. Will try this again if I visit montreal again. Good place to have a fancy dinner."}
{"text":"The Skinny: great complementary sides, so-so steak (3) lackluster service and ambience (1) value: even with the excellent side dishes, if you factor everything else, it's still really pricey (2).  Let me get preface this review. Do not come here if you want to impress anyone (unless he/she enjoys eating contests). Do not come here thinking you can have a coherent conversation. Do not come here in nice clothing. Do not come here in a large party (ie, greater than 4). And if you are a woman, do not get drunk here.  Okay. Now I can start the review.  So, a friend of mine made reservations for a party of 7 at Moishe's while we were in town. Some of our party would be arriving late (flight delays) but we asked if they would seat us (4/7 were there). They agreed to do so and ushered us to our table. Two of us ordered drinks in the interim while we waited. About 20 minutes later, the manager steps by inquires about the status of our party and informs us that if they did not show up soon that they would remove us from our table because they had a bunch of people waiting.  Now here's my beef. If you have a policy of not seating a party until everyone has arrived because you are busy then so be it. Just don't seat us. But to seat a party and then inform them that they would have to leave their table while they're ordering drinks consistently from the waiter... that's embarassing for the host of the party and it's definitely poor form.  In addition to this, the seating arrangements were horrible. We were seated in a long table propped up against a wall. Essentially, half of our party could not effectively get in or out of their chairs without bothering someone.  The ambience screams old school steakhouse with its brickwalls, sepia photographs, dim lighting, and white tablecloths. I think the sounds must bounce off the walls because you will be surrounded by an unbearable constant din. Ventilation is apparently poor because by the end of the evening, you'll smell like you've been basting in a delightful combination of your own sweat and dripping meat juices from the grilled steaks. So ladies, leave your couture at home.  Another unfortunate thing was the woman's washroom. All I can say is, it is an lawsuit waiting to happen. Located up a precariously steep staircase near the lobby area, it is potentially dangerous in combination with a little booze and heels. Therefore, watch the drinks, girls!  Servicewise, our waiter was MIA a lot of time. After our orders were placed, we didn't see him for a significant period of time. Often, we'd have to inform other staff about our drink orders which lead to even longer wait times. It also took well over 30+ minutes to receive our order. I cook at home and I can tell you for a fact: it does not take 30+ minutes to prepare a steak. Oh, and don't get me started on how long it took to get the cheque.  Okay, now that I've gotten most of the negatives off my chest, let's look at the positives.  When we arrived at our table, we were immediately served complementary plates of chilled coleslaw, warm bread and pickles. The coleslaw was a herb/vinaigrette version (ie, not the creamy kind). Light, refreshing, it was perfectly dressed and really hit the spot in the overly warm restaurant. The bread basket filled with warm crusty baguette, flavourful rye, and satisfying pumpernickel was wonderful as well. The pickles were also a lovely addition to the table to munch on while we waited for friends to arrive.  I'd ordered a grilled petit ribeye steak from the lighter side menu which comes with a choice of potato. Let me tell you there is nothing petit about this thing. It was massive! It was about the size of a standard dinner plate. I glanced over at my friend who ordered the regular version and it was a Flintstone-esque portion size.  Sadly enough, the steak itself was only okay in my books. I don't think the steak was aged enough or had enough fat content because it was a little tougher and less flavourful than expected. It also lacked that beautiful carmelized crust on top that you see with a good preparation. Certainly not worth the $39 pricetag.  The accompanying Monte Cristo potato however was a thing of beauty. Flavourful, buttery, fluffy, it was one of the best double baked potatoes I've had. The chives mixed in made it all the more satisfying.  Seriously, if it was just the sides, I'd give this place a 3.5 on the verge of a 4. But because I couldn't over look that so-so steak, this place gets a 3 for food.  All in all, if you follow the above advice and have lowered expectations in service and ambience, you could come here for a pretty good tuck in because the portion sizes are highly generous. However, if you're looking for a romantic dinner with high end service, trying to impress the boss or looking to eat with more than 4 people, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"fantastic little $25 two-course dinner after 9p - the rib steak is thinner than a ribeye, perfectly seasoned and comes with a beautiful monte carlo baked potato.  the boy asked, \"what are the other options for the side?\" to which the waiter responded with a waning voice, \"a plain one\" - and his face fell with his tone, crestfallen he would be if we opted for that obviously inferior, lame, and dumb potato choice.  so we didnt.  we rocked the monte carlo which was a twice-baked style potato beyond creamy, beyond dreamy, and purely awesome.  also, free cabbage slaw (so tangy and sweet and complimentary!) and the iced butter are lovely free treats that can easily fill you up.  i might have gotten a little knockered on the moishes mojito (so healthy with all that mint.  gotta get your greens in !)  sauteed spinach was whatever. dont get your greens that way.  ps. please dont order the chopped liver. its awful. i think dog food is more appetizing."}
{"text":"Last night was probably one of the WORST experiences I've had in restaurants and I owe it all to the condescending French waiter who completely disrespected my entire table of 9 guys, the waiter was extremely unprofessional, and purposely made us wait around 45 minutes - 1 hour to receive our entrée. Overall the experience was Appalling and completely ruined my birthday meal with my close friends."}
{"text":"Moishe's has some of that old style steakhouse charm - ornate decorations, attentive service, attention to detail - that I love. We enjoyed our dinner here, but I don't think we'll be in a hurry to return (more on that later). The selection of drinks is very nice, and the bartender knows his stuff. The wine list is good, but a little thin on older selections, and the list is not kept current, so you need to ask what is there and what is different. The complimentary pickles and coleslaw are excellent - really, they were almost the high point of the meal. We started off with the Caesar salad (nice, well flavoured, but not prepared tableside, so why is it $13?) and a dozen oysters (these were excellent - fresh, flavourful and well shucked). The steaks were really good - we chose the 85 day dry aged steaks - very tender, with a slight nutty flavor, cooked over charcoal to give it that extra flavour only fire can bring to meat. They came with the signature monte carlo potato (very tasty) and we ordered the grilled oyster mushrooms (these were unevenly cooked and had charred edges). For dessert there was the crème brulee (ah, beautiful simplicity, my blood sugar is rising) and chocolate cake (decadent, rich, just the way it should be). They have some excellent staff here, but our waiter was definitely not one of them. Which leads me to why I don't rank Moishe's only 3 stars. The steaks are really good, but the extras that make the experience special, that elevate a place to 5 stars, that justify this sort of expenditure, just weren't there. Things like not updating the wine list, making the salads in the kitchen instead of tableside, mediocre sides and poor service detract from the overall experience. At this price, I expect a lot, and Moishe's didn't deliver enough bang for the buck. Really good, but not worth this price."}
{"text":"This is my fave steakhouse by far! I am writing this review after having gone there at least 5 times. The food and service are always consistent, and the after 9 menu is a bargain.   I had the Caesar salad, the rib steak, Fried onions, a coffee and the chocolate pecan salted caramel tart. The Caesar salad was ok, but nothing special, I preferred my husband's house salad over mine. The rib steak was cooked exactly like I'd requested and was seasoned so well there was no need for any sauce to accompany it! The fried onions were amazing, thin and crispy and paired perfectly with the steak. I also had some of my husband's Monte Carlo potato which was divine! The tart was alright, I appreciated that it wasn't overly sweet and the salted caramel sauce drizzled over it was to die for, but the tart itself was just ok, they do however make a great strong coffee to go with it.   The restaurant itself has a very old charm to it, however be advised that with the open layout of the room, it can get pretty noisy so keep that in mind if you are planning a romantic dinner out. The free parking in the back earns a star rating on its own as it is very rare to find a restaurant with parking on St-Laurent."}
{"text":"12 went for dinner. Service was great. Steaks were all very undercooked and horribly bland. Tasteless and chewy. Some sent theirs back and they came back dry. Have been there many times over the years and enjoyed it tremendously each time. This steak dinner was one of the worst dinners I've ever had. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I don't know why some of the reviews for this Montreal treasure are so terrible as they are simply not justified.  Reservations for a Sat night.  Place was busy and we were seated promptly:  Our server, Serge, was friendly, attentive, but also left us to ourselves as a good professional will do.  We ordered Caesar salad to start, rib steak and filet along with Monte Carlo potato, mushrooms, and asparagus.  Old fashioned and Caesar drinks.  Everything was great.  Food quality was excellent, especially the meat.  I was horrified to hear some people asking for HP sauce.  It's not an Outback people no need to mask your meat!!  Key lime pie shared for dessert was perfect end to a perfect dinner.  Absolutely great steak resto!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here to celebrate an anniversary dinner.  Good streak, terrible service.  We were in and out in 45 minutes.  I've never felt so rushed at a restaurant in my life.  You'd literally be lifting your fork to your mouth with the last bite when the waiter would grab your plate away from you.  Maybe a good place to go if you're a business person in a rush to conduct your dinner, or you like to enter speed eating contests.  If you want a nice relaxing evening, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We heard a lot of good things about this place. What grabbed our attention was the after 9 menu. The food here was really good, nothing fantastic. I got the impression that this was a really fancy place, but some people were showing up in hockey jerseys as if they were stopping at a diner on the way home from a game. Staff is nice and attentive but also aloof. Different from experiences at other restaurants."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite steakhouse in the world.  I have been to all the trendy and popular places in Montreal as a frequent visitor.  I can honestly say no one beats Moishe's. Their prices may have gone up a bit in the last few years, but the food and the experience is worth it.  This is the one place I never miss when I come to Montreal."}
{"text":"Endroit typique et mythique, un des plus vieux resto à Montréal La viande est de qualité internationale Décor feutré, digne des grands steakhouse new-yorkais Endroit un peu dispendieux mais il y a un menu de fin de soirée abordable A essayer!"}
{"text":"1ST CLASS! With notoriety comes expectation and Moishe's delivers on every point. Consistently noted as one of the best steakhouses in North America, Moishe's sets a standard for the classic steakhouse concept that isn't easily meet. The entire experience is like a throwback to yesteryear ... the rooms, the decor and the professionalism of the servers are all very well preserved in time, but not at all outdated. More like an antique grandfather clock or an old Citroën ... built well and even better maintained. The focus is on high quality food ingredients and simple execution. There's no \"fusion\" there's no \"innovation\" (and I'm glad!).  There's also no pretension, just classy, respectful professional servers, excellent cuts of meat and seafood and an experience you really can't find many other places. I was truly impressed with this place and my expectation were high."}
{"text":"I've gone twice and both times I wasn't paying. If I had to pick up the tab, I'd knock off a star or two cause having to pay 50 bucks for a steak out of my own pocket would feel like a shot in the gut. So it's the place to take your wealthy deep-pocketed relatives when you know they'll pick up the tab, a freeloaders paradise for the guiltless and shameless. Quite frankly no plate of beef in the world is worth that much(maybe Kobe?). But this old-fashioned Jewish steak house in the heart of the Main is the real deal. It's been around since 1938 and it's a staple of the old Jewish neighborhood (Leonard Cohen has reportedly been spotted there on numerous occasions). My ethnic pride tells me that's it a hell of a lot better than Montreal's \"other\" steakhouse, Queue de Cheval, although truth be told I've never eaten there. And unlike most steakhouses which generally have an off-putting and unappealing cigar-bar-like ambience of businessmen fresh from power meetings or the golf course, Moishe's screams old world authenticity (lots of wood paneling, wine racks, uniformed waitstaff)."}
{"text":"Obviously you should go here for the steak, the steak is superb.  The waiter we had was not (hence the 4 stars), he was a rude, arrogant, ball of hate...probably mostly for his job. Oh and my salmon tartare was meh, it tasted like lemon..not salmon.  BUT the steak is so good, you'll forget most of the little annoyances.   I will come back, but I hope to never see that little snob of a waiter again."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best steaks I've eaten in Montreal.  We went for the 25$ special after 9pm and it was worth every penny and more. The coleslaw, the pickles, the bread, the Monte Carlo potato everything was superb."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars bordering on 5.  This place is a legit, old school steakhouse.  No frills; just solid drinks, steaks and food.  Went with a group of 5 and for entrees we all split two massive bone in fillets, one massive rib eye, and one order of lamb chops.  All meat was cooked to perfection, was buttery soft and tasted awesome.  The lamb chops were my favorite.  Just the right amount of salt.  We ate everything.  Standard steak house sides of spinach, asparagus, french fries and mushrooms were all delicious, but could have come in a bit bigger portions for sharing.  Appetizers of caesar salad, chopped salad, shrimp cocktail,  and caprese salad were enjoyed.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  The cocktail sauce with the shrimp could have used a bit more zing--some more horseradish possibly.    Service was excellent.  No complaints.  Prices on par with top tier steakhouses.  Complimentary pickles and cole slaw were consumed and replenished numerous times.  Best meal we had in Montreal. Overall, everyone was pleased.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"The pickled salad was great throughout the course.  So crunchy and fresh and free!   The carpaccio was very underwhelming but the 45 day aged prime ribeye steak more than made up for it.  You can definitely taste the aging process with the strong beefy and at some point blue-cheese like smell and flavor.  I was pleasantly surprised that the ribeye cap was quite large which is my favorite part of the ribeye steak that is also the most marbled.  The only thing they could have improve on was to make it bone-in.    A must have while in MTL. :)"}
{"text":"Emily L's review sums it up for me. Though it should be noted that this fine dining experience is accompanied by top forty radio in the background? Why? How does this set the stage for fine dining? Well, judging from the food, it sets the stage quite well.  I ordered the crab cake, the porterhouse and the asparagus.  The latter was oddly dressed in vinegar then grilled. It was very off tasting. A disagreeable preparation for certain. The waiter saw that it was not eaten and did not ask if there was an issue. He must have known.  The steak was awful. Huge amount of gristle. Extremely dry. I would advise going to get marinated filet mignon at the wonderful Adonis market as an alternative.  The crab most certainly had been treated with Sodium tripolyphosphate. The numbing effect on the mouth was almost immediate and the expected effects - fever and \"traveler's stomach\"- where the reward for the $200 dinner throughout the night.  I liked the pickle."}
{"text":"Ok guys, I cannot stress enough how important it is for you all to drop what you are doing and go to moishes and have their Monte Carlo potato. It is the mother of all potatoes. Bucket list potato. Just do it please. Apart from potato perfection, this place is all kinds of wonderful. A great restaurant to visit with friends and family, especially if you have something to celebrate. The staff really takes care of you and gives you a great experience. The food is delicious. The dessert is on point. It's a very classy restaurant and they have really good deals on friday and sunday nights. Again, the potato...life changing. The end."}
{"text":"Last weekend finally had a chance to try out Moishe's after 9pm...25$ menu and really enjoyed it. Although their regular menu is quite on the pricey side the $25 after 9 menu is well worth it if you are looking to try some excellent steak dishes in the city. As for ambiance, Moishe's definitely has quite an amazing ambience. Very classy and takes you back in time with it's stupendous chandeliers and white linen table cloths. One quickly notices the striking difference in clientele between the before 9 p.m. crowd and after 9 p.m. crowd. The only catch with the after 9 p.m. menu for $25 is that the table must order a bottle of wine which is not too bad because they have specials on wines after 9 p.m. for only $50 a bottle. Now for the food, what can I say Moishe's definitely does live up to its reputation as serving some amazing steak. I had their grilled rib steak and it was truly delicious. I also had the Monte Carlo baked potato which was out of this world packed with flavor! The steak was grilled to Perfection and the combination of spices was simply mouth-watering. The $25 after 9 menu includes an entree main dish and tea and coffee. Desert is not included. If you want to order dessert I strongly recommend sharing as their dessert portions are really humongousty.I would definitely recommend this restaurant for all steak lovers. Although eating after 9 might seem late to some , it is still worth trying out at least once. I must not forget to mention that they serve their amazing famous pickles and coleslaw which the waiters graciously refill. Great place for friends get together, special occasion, birthday celebration and romantic dinner for 2."}
{"text":"PROS: -Food is yummy, but there was nothing spectacular that I haven't seen before in terms of food and decor. I prefer Gibby's for steak because it has more personality, a warmer atmosphere, and it was an overall more interesting dining experience.  -Friendly service.  CONS: -Kind of an odd atmosphere. Most of the people working and dining were about 3 times my age. Maybe it was just that night.  -Based on my first experience, I probably won't go again."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for over 20 years. The food is THAT good. This place has an old world style atmosphere so if you're looking for trendy go elsewhere. If you are looking for a pleasant ambiance, excellent service and great food, this is the place.  I usually get the filet mignon for its perfectly cooked melt-in-your-mouth taste. If you like mille feuille, you owe it to yourself to try the one here. It's amazing!  Reservations recommended!"}
{"text":"Service was good, not too noise as a place. My first steak was very tasty but I asked for medium rare and got a well done. They asked right away to change, same for my bestie. The waitress came to clean my table and left with my glass of wine, so they brought me a new one. Second steak was ok, cooked well but was just unlucky and got one with plenty of nerfs :-( Overall I liked, first time there but I will return for fur"}
{"text":"When in Montreal, live freely and be happy and one must eat at this Montreal Institution at least once in one's life time.  I started with a Long Island ice tea -- nice but they are much stiffer and delicious in NYC.    The table bread was nice but the butter was too hard.  The coleslaw was exceptional -- likely one of the best item (free) at this Gold-Gilded era ambiance; actually the ceiling reliefs are \"silver\" in color.    I had the crab cake as an appetizer (at my waiter's suggestion; I wanted to try the lobster sandwich).  The crab cake was alright; nothing special.  It was only one, the size of a hockey puck.  My steak arrived in about 15 minutes -- 45-day dry-aged porterhouse.  I had it done medium well.  The crust was exceptionally delicious.  The meat itself was nothing special and some sections near the bone still had some ligament.  Overall, it's NOT worth $75; the portion is small for that price!  (I had better steaks in Las Vegas and Albany, NY.). Total bill came to C$154.52 (including 20% tip of $25.75) which translated to US$118.74.  Good thing the U.S. $ (my bank gives me U.S. $0.76 for C$1.00) is much stronger than C$.  Otherwise, I would have stayed away.  And the dinning room is very noisy!  The wait staff (second tier) is very attentive but my own waiter (order taker) came only once or twice, to check on me -- maybe to make sure I hadn't choked on the ordinary (but sold as special) steak.    Regardless, I'm glad I tried this Montreal Institution -- Moishe's Steakhouse.  But I'm unlikely to return here unless someone who is extremely wealthy pays for my meal here :)  Even then, I'd go someplace else as this place is very noisy -- the entire dinning room is a huge room, like a huge dinning room you'd find in a prison (actually, I felt like a prisoner of must-do-when-in-Montreal thing).  I couldn't even hear myself think.  NO MORE NEXT TIME.    One can skip this old place; Montreal now has lots and lots of dinning options, and there are likely better steak houses.  (Montreal is becoming a victim of its own successes -- way to much overbuilding of office and residential towers; but it would be nice to have a few more new hotels.)"}
{"text":"OverCrowded, OverPriced, OverHyped, UnderCooked, Pretentious.  If you want to dress up and shine your shoes and get the car waxed, got a hot date or wanna impress your family or friends with a night out at a swanky Montreal hot spot...well THIS AIN'T THE PLACE! Love to overpay, and love to get badly cooked meats? This is YOUR PLACE! Love CROWDS of NOISY people all bunched up in a low METAL ceiling where sound just accentuates? Here it is!  Pretentious place, VERY PRICEY, tight seating arrangements (could we fit another table? YES! Ten more tables! MORE$$$$ mouahahahah!)  I can cook a better steak at home, just as THICK, but mine stays way more juicy and tasteful. My steaks are cooked to perfection. Moishe's steaks are AGED?!?! REALLY?  PRETENTIOUS, \"look at me!\" kinda place. Noisy, tasteless, WAYYYY OVER priced, crowded...does that sound good to you? Not to me. Sorry I ever got duped to go there.  Wow! A lot of caps!  Visited November 2013"}
{"text":"Cutting it close,  going to Moishe's on Saturday night after 9 pm without reservation. It was worth the wait! It's has been a long time since I've been there, but the service was great and the foods consistency is  as I remembered. As your seated you get the fresh bread,  slaw and pickles to Nosh on while taking a chat  of deciding what the main meal is going to be. Monte Carlo with the works is a must that goes perfectly with a rib eye steak. It was cooked to perfection and just melted in my mouth. There is a reason why it's the best steak house in town... it is! Can't wait to go back.. oh forgot to say that after 9 the menu is $25 including desert and coffee!! Filet Minon is an added$10$! Yummy!"}
{"text":"People always seem to rave about this place as a montreal institution.  My experience here did not live up to those expectations.  The food was average and we were brought the bill without having finished our meals after 50 minutes.  Am never going back..."}
{"text":"Meat 3 Pickles 5x Meat sauce 5x Service 5x Location 4x Everything is great except the meat ! It was lower than my expectations. That's why I rate only the meat."}
{"text":"Reservations is preferred .  The decor is a bit old fashion and kinda classy.  We dressed casual and didn't get good service.  We went with another couple and they agreed too.  My fillet mignon was okay and this place is very overpriced for the quality.  We had better service and experience even at an expensive taste."}
{"text":"All around home run for these guys Just make sure your not seated in the middle of the dining room because the traffic was to much we asked to be moved and they accommodated Us beautifully  Thank you for a wonderful experience"}
{"text":"I was certain I had reviewed Moishe's before but maybe I'm slipping.  We found this place based on searching Montreal restaurant recommendations via Yelp about 5 years ago. We've been back 3 or 4 times during F1 visits and never disappointed.  We are fond of their 9pm menu which is $25 pp for an appetizer, main, and coffee/tea; it really is a huge savings if you can find something that suits you. Their main menu is larger as expected. I've had a few different options and loved them all. The very best to start with is their renowned coleslaw and dill pickles placed on your table immediately; they are incredible. This time I once again had their rack of lamb cooked exactly as requested. My favourite tho is the rib steak which my husband had and it was so very tasty and juicy - he was kind enough to share some :). For an appetizer I had the salmon tartar and he had the chopped liver with fried onions - this was a new one for him and he really liked it. I'm a big fan of their tartar and therefore repeatedly order it.  The service is impeccable and everyone very friendly. I especially like the old ambiance which stays true to their \"schtick\".   If you have not been I say go and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant, especially when it comes to celebrating special occasions. I've been going here for years and they have yet to disappoint me. On this particular night, I ordered the steak with their famous Monte Carlo potato. And on top of that I had asked for an extra potato to go since they are so delicious. When the main entrees came, they had accidentally given me both potatos at once. The waiter apologized and said a new potato would be prepared when it came time to leave. Lo and behold, I ended up with 3 potatoes for the price of 2 that night! The service was great and the food was exceptional."}
{"text":"Ribeye steak was huge, cooked to perfection.  Chicken soup for appetizer was as good as grandma's.  Plenty of bread provided.  Chocolate cake for dessert was heavenly.  Service was the best.  Great place for dinner as long as you're ok with about $100 a person."}
{"text":"The steaks here were so good and juicy. Among the best I've ever had. I went with my cousin and we were amazed by how good it was.  The only downside is that it is very pricey. But, if you can afford it or if you want to celebrate somewhere for a major occasion, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, great service, formal old school style steak house, when in Montreal, you must eat here."}
{"text":"The place exudes class with 0 pretentiousness. A Montreal institution,  they offer a great value meal after 9pm on Thursdays through Saturdays ($25 for an appetizer and main course) . I hesitated to review before having been a few times and am glad I did.   As you wait in the lobby, grab a drink and loosen up in the lounge area. Once seated,  they provide you with all-you-can-eat pickles (mmmmm!) and coleslaw with warm bread to munch on. On my last visit,  I ordered the Salmon tar tar w. Caviar and crackers as an appetizer. Delicious. The right balance of flavours and portion. You'll be ready for the main course when it comes. For the main,  I ordered the filet mignon poutine. Do not under estimate it. It is extremely filling. Amazing peppercorn gravy,  generous amount of cheese curds and the filet mignon. So good. I've had the dish elsewhere but Moishe's takes top spot in the city,  in my opinion.   Great place for a nice dinner out with the boys or for a romantic dinner with the significant other.   ***The value dinner is good but go knowing that you will likely not be getting the AAA grade meat for the steak (which is why I go for the filet mignon pout). Twice now I have ordered the rib steak and they had alot of cartilage and were thin. But..... that said,  it is still the best deal in town. I would give it 5 stars if I had a consistent experience each visit."}
{"text":"I love Moishe's. Simply the best steakhouse in Montreal. I've had their steaks, Atlantic cod and salmon. All were superb. My boyfriend loves their coleslaw, he ends up having 2 plates full by himself. Lol. The price is expected for the type of service and food you get. Staff is always ready to tend to you and very polite. We've never made reservations before and they have always had room for us,  no matter how packed it was. This place is well worth it, you won't regret a thing."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a Jewish institution in Montreal. It's been around a long, long time. Places don't stay around this long arbitrarily; they last because they're good and they have a loyal clientele.   My grandparents frequented this restaurant, my parents go regularly to this restaurant, and I used to go here a lot growing up (and I still do, when I visit my hometown).   Do I think it's the best steak in the entire universe? No, not really. I think it's darn good, but it's not the absolute best I've ever had. My father would disagree with me, though. For him, this restaurant consistently serves the best steaks he's ever had, anywhere, hands down. I guess this difference in opinion is due to the fact that everyone's sense of taste (physically, literally) differs, and everyone's sensibilities differ. There's a great deal of nostalgia filtering our respective opinions as well.   I love this place, just knowing the history here, and the fact that so many generations of Montrealers have their family histories tied into this restaurant's history. I like how the waiters know my parents so well, and knew me when I was growing up and my dad when he was young, too. (How we miss Frank!). I love the coleslaw and famous pickles and fried onions. The martinis are always great. The service is always attentive. The steaks are very, very good (ranging to excellent or awesome, depending on one's taste). The plates of mandel bread (Jewish cookies) or choices from the pastry cart all make for a super dessert with coffee. Real coffee. In coffee cups. This is tradition. This is good."}
{"text":"I'm not from Montreal but consider Moishe's, especially the late night special, as one of my \"go to\" places to eat in the city -good for groups especially bachelor parties; after eating you can walk down St Laurent to all the clubs and bars -make a reservation via opentable -they speak English; staff is professional but friendly -restaurant is dark but clean and comfortable -they do allow for bottle service at special pricing during late night menu -wide selection of beer and wine -$25 cad late night special is tremendous value. 9pm to Midnight. Thur to Sat. you get appetizer + main dish + coffee/tea -my recommendation is go with the salmon tartar and then the rib steak (medium rare, its a large portion!). then get the monte carlo potato ($5 more) -free pickles (solid), cole slaw (which is actually good) and bread, which is above average  pay moishes a visit especially if you are a group of guys headed out after for a night on the town"}
{"text":"Fancy cheap place to go for their night special only. Else, I think it's still a nice place to go if you don't mind paying the full price ;)  I liked the ambiance. Service was good. I feel like I was in one of those fancy place I'd usually never go because it's too expensive for my wallet.  Food is excellent!"}
{"text":"The meal here was similar to what I have experienced at many other steakhouses.  The food is way overpriced and the quality is marginal.  We went for the 45 dry aged Porterhouse steak and it arrived cooked very well but lacking in seasoning and all of the character you come to expect and pay for in a dry aged steak.  The sides were very average as well.  The one good thing was the service.  We had a big group and they handled everything well.  Definitely not the best choice in Montreal."}
{"text":"I went to Moishes last night with my family for a birthday celebration. We were seated when the whole party had arrived. We took advantage of the \"after 9\" menu, where you get an appetizer, a main and a coffee/tea for $25. The selection is obviously limited and sides aren't included. The filet mignon is $10 extra and each side is $5 extra.  At Moishes, they serve you a complimentary bread basket with butter, pickles and coleslaw. YUM - I love their pickles and coleslaw. I enjoyed the salmon tartare appetizer though it's a little on the bland side. I got their filet mignon butterflied, which was well cooked but not the best filet mignon I've had.   Their special chicken is really good - the seasoning is delicious. The peppercorn gravy that comes with the steak frites/monte carlo is divine. The monte carlo potato itself is a must-try but very heavy so maybe share it with others. I would avoid the fries, average when compared to the whole meal.  We got some decaf coffee to finish off the meal and my brother got a delicious piece of chocolate cake for his b-day. The waiter was a little sarcastic but we didn't mind it; the service was ok. And btw this is a very loud restaurant.  We ended up paying $240 for 6 people without drinks. Everyone enjoyed their meal and found the food delicious! Would probably go back for another occasion to enjoy the \"after 9\" special.   FYI they have complimentary parking behind the restaurant in a private lot. Very important since parking isn't easy to find in this area."}
{"text":"Monte Carlo potatoes were the best! The streak frites that I got were very good but wasn't anything too special tbh. The beef carpaccio on the other hand was something else - very tender, perfect flavour - you can tell that Moishe's cares about their meat. The coleslaw was surprisingly good too - normally sides don't get much of a spotlight but in this case, they do. They definitely helped with making the whole experience enjoyable. The chocolate cake was very nice too - super rich and thick! Service was okay - the servers were a bit standoffish and were increasingly neglectful as we continued to dine. I would definitely recommend getting the beef carpaccio and getting the Monte Carlo potatoes. So so good!"}
{"text":"Came here for the after 9PM special with friends. I have gone once before years ago and really enjoyed it. I ordered the rib steak and chopped liver as an appetizer. It\"s a great deal and very worth it.   Sure you're eating a million calories late at night but who cares? Just enjoy it! Service is attentive and steak is cooked just the way you like it. Would come back!"}
{"text":"We came here for the late night menu and unlike my previous reviewers, we had a great meal.   We reserved prior to getting here and once we arrived, the host knew our names, offered to hang our coats and directed us to our table.   We both ordered our rib eyes medium and got one salmon and one salad for appetizer as well as a monte carlo potato ($5 extra). I must say that I was not impressed at all by the salad (think spring greens with olive oil and some balsamic) but the salmon was not bad. However, the star of the meal was the steak and the potato. I don't eat baked potatoes very often but theirs was extremely delicious: they empty out the potato, make a mash and season it and then fill up the skin with the mashed potato and bake it - it was super flavourful and silky. Both our steaks came a perfect medium and the portions were huge! Although, I've had better ones but for $25, I am not complaining.   Overall, the meal was definitely worth the $55 dollars (2 late night meal and a potato)."}
{"text":"Although the food and service are amazing, the 3 hours to Midnight special is the only way to go for us students. Thursday to Saturday, after 9pm, $25 for all-you-can-eat crisp acidic coleslaw, crunchy fresh pickles, and warm bread. You also get an appetizer, main dish, side, and tea/coffee. Really, all the mains are great, so you can't go wrong. Just remember the portions are a little smaller. If you like your meat medium or less, try to avoid the rib steak. It's too thin, so you risk it being overcooked. However, the rib steak is a solid option when ordering from the regular menu. Play it safe with the petit-filet and be sure to ask for garlic and spice on top. For the appetizer, the salmon tartare is really great... much better than a plain ol' salad.   Now, the moment you've all been waiting for... the Coup de Grâce. Leave your diets at the door, grab those lactaid pills if you need them, and forget about being a vegan. When the waiter asks you what you want as the side, the only answer is, \"Monte-Carlo, please!\"    Two main reasons why this isn't a 5-star: (1) They recently added a $5 extra charge for the petit-filet on the $25 special menu... not a huge issue since the cost/value ratio is still great; and (2) I've been to Moishe's many, many, many times - sometime's the steak doesn't come out as I was hoping for. The consistency is a little off, but they always remedy the situation without any question at all. Again, not the biggest concern.   Finally, the restaurant gets very busy at times, so be prepared to wait just a bit. Grab a drink, sit back, and relax. The food is worth the wait. Once you've had a steak at Moishe's, you can't go anywhere else... not even Gibby's (yup, that one is going to cause a little stir... oh well!)  Eat up!  P.S.: Go to Costco, buy the Moishe's $100.00 gift card for $80.00 - you get 2 x $50.00 and you don't have to spend it all at once. This gift card makes the deal that much sweeter!"}
{"text":"Based on a recommendation from a local, we decided to check this place out. I ordered the filet mignon and grilled shrimp, both were extremely delicious, and the meat was very tender. In addition, service was quick and efficient.   Only things I think that could be improved are:  1) French fries - pretty standard fare,   2) Chicken soup - I could be spoiled by my wife's chicken soup, but the flavors were pretty bland and noodles were a little overcooked.   Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"Had to visit this steakhouse institution during our visit.  So glad we did!  This classic, old school steakhouse was exceptional...somewhere between a 4.5 and a 5...but certainly worthy of a visit (but be sure to go in very very hungry)!  Service was very good.  You sit down and they serve you with mounds of pickles (excellent), home made cole slaw (outstanding) and bread (very tasty).  We ordered a variety of dishes, some outstanding, some just ok: Rib Eye: OUTSTANDING!  Order it medium-rare...just awesome Filet:  Good, not great Onion-Rings:  Sensational...worth ordering! French Fries:  Average...not great Teriyaki Chicken:  Very good Shrimp:  Excellent  Worth a visit...great restaurant!"}
{"text":"After years of putting it off, I finally made my long awaited pilgrimage to Moishe's. The holy land of steak.   I let a friend of mine order for me. Being an expert at Moishe's, I felt assured that he wouldn't steer me wrong. The order is placed, bone in filet mignon arrives, medium rare (to perfection). OMG... It was everything he said it would be. Probably the best meat I've ever eaten in my life (I hope this doesn't end up in Penthouse Forum;) anyhooo...   I found the wine list on the high side. And the decor is certainly intended to impress my dad. But if you want to have a great steak, GO! I now know why this place has been around for as long as it has."}
{"text":"Moishe's is THE Montreal Jewish Steakhouse, the way it's meant to be...  Great cuts of meat, the ambiance of an old Jewish boys' club, happy families, couples, men... you name it.  Moishe's tastes like the Montreal of my childhood.  It is pricey and the wait can be long... but for an authentic Montreal carnivore experience, make sure to spend an evening at Moishe's."}
{"text":"One thing, make sure to go after 9pm on weekends if you want to get a good deal! Basically, every Thursday, Friday and Saturday evening after 9, they offer a special menu at a discounted price of 25$. Another tip, make sure to call in advance to reserve, although that might hit or miss sometimes. Last time, we reserved for 10pm and were only seated at around 10:40...  Now, let's talk a bit about the food and the service. The service is what you would expect from a high scale steakhouse (hence the $$$$ price rating on Yelp). Waiters are mostly always around and ready to serve you. As for the food, considering the price after 9pm, it is worth it! I usually go for a piece of rib steak. As at any steakhouse, you can choose how you want your meat done. For an extra 5$, you can get a side (which includes french fries, monte carlo potatoes, fried onions - not onion rings, or spinach).  Bottomline, I'd recommend it, but only if you go after 9pm!"}
{"text":"The rib eye steak and the Monte Carlo potato I had were wonderful. The steak was juicy, and perfectly cooked red-pink throughout. I suspect the potato was half butter, but is was still delicious. Had these been the only components of my experience, I would rate Moshie's a 4.5. (Half a point was deducted because of the general snobbiness and absorbent prices... Seriously, you charge $70 for a steak and can't throw in a potato for free?)   However, the filet mignon my mother ordered was atrocious and the handling of the issue was unprofessional to say the least. Like me, my mom ordered her steak medium done. What came though, was a dry, flavourless brown brick with a finger print worth of pink in the middle. My mom isn't one to complain or let small things bother her, but because the steak was virtually inedible, she mentioned it to our waiter. Now, in most places, the automatic response would be to replace the steak. In our case, our server claimed that because of a filet mignon's low fat marbling, this was bound to happen. Wtf? I am aware filet mignon cuts have a lower fat content, but you would think that an establishment that prides itself on its steaks would realize that and adjust for cooking time and heat. After no answer, he then proclaimed, \"Well what do you want me to do?\" It's quite obvious... Replace the goddam steak. However, my mom is avid to avoid conflict and just said she wanted to let him know. The end result was a $70 inedible steak.   Our bill comes. As a way to make it up to my mom, they provide us with two table spoons each of wine in miniature wine glasses. Really? Couldn't even bother to bring my mom one full glass of wine?   What happened next was just atrocious though. Never in my whole life of dining have I ever saw a waiter open the bill and count the money right in front of his customers before. He then asked us if we wanted change. The common curtesy is to remove the bill, get change, and leave it up to the customer to remove whatever they want or leave it all.   I don't know how he could ever think this was okay. It implies that you don't think the customer paid the full amount or left you a tip (which my mom did, and a generous one which he did not deserve).   For $200 for one dinner, I expected so much more. How one could serve a filet mignon that disgusting and how one can allow your servers to behave that way was beyond me. The guy acted like serving us was beneath him. We're all equal human beings, but serving customers is your job. You might as well make your customers comfortable.   End rating: 2 stars (the ribeye saved it from being one star)"}
{"text":"For our first dinner in Montreal this was the perfect location. My wife and I decided to split a ribeye steak and we made the right decision. The steak was 22 ounces and cooked to perfection with a twice baked potato that was a great complement to the steak. The service was impeccable and they even brought a complimentary piece of chocolate cake for my wife's birthday which was also excellent. This restaurant is a must go if you are in Montreal and looking for a great steak."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and her business contact in Montreal. Both the food and the service were excellent!!! Try the beef tartare, filet mignon, and the black cod."}
{"text":"Very impressive. Had ribeye (aged). Prepared with garlic and spices. Incredibly soft and delicious and packed with flavors. The pureed potatoes and spinach sides were fabulous. Cole slaw and pickles to start were yummy. Gotta say it was one of the more memorable steaks I've ever had which says a lot. Decor leaves something to be desired and mixed crowd which was quirky. Absolutely worth a visit. They also have a special menu after 9pm which seems more reasonable but I didn't try that."}
{"text":"Apparently these guys have a 25$ late night menu. Either way, when I paid full price for my steak I was more than delighted. The service is second to none and the place is frozen in time. This joint is for real and a Montreal landmark.  If you feel underdressed when you're seated and waited on but no worries, you'll get the same respect and attention as anyone else. After all you are a paying customer."}
{"text":"solid meal. pickles were a novel touch I wasn't used to. Steak was good but not great.."}
{"text":"If you want great quality cuts and an actual medium rare steak, come eat here.  The service is on point and the steaks are delicious.  However, do not go for the late night $25 menu if you are expecting what I mentioned above. You get for what you pay for.  Come dine here if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"I got dinner at Moishe's steakhouse a couple of nights ago with a friend who's visiting and was told she should check this place out. I got there 5 minutes early and waited in the waiting area/room which has an interesting collection of vintage artifacts on display. There's a place to check your coat, a bar to order drinks and furniture to sit while waiting... It is a fairly formal restaurant and with a bit of imagination you could be walking into the Godfather movie as you get in the main dining hall. Nonetheless, with the leather chairs, relatively low ceiling and enormous, kinda old-school chandeliers the restaurant has a familiar warm charming character to it as well.  We both had a small appetite. So we shared a (boneless) fillet mignon and a Monte Carlo potato. The fillet mignon doesn't come with any side vegetables and, nevertheless, half of it seemed like a full meal to the both of us. It was perfectly juicy inside and not burned on the outside at all. The monte carlo potato was the definition of comfort food for me: warm soft creamy mashed potato with just the right amount of herbs mixed in hiding under a beautiful crunchy layer of cheese (most probably mixed with other things).  We were going for drinks afterwards and so decided to skip dessert. The bill came at about $80 for the two of us. which was very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food we had :) Different servers bring bread, water and take order etc. Despite the fact that the restaurant was fairly busy, the servers worked together seamlessly and our main server was remarkably kind and tolerant of our excited chats and laughs while we were trying to order. Overall we had a great time. I wouldn't go back alone (because of the portion size and the price). but would love to go back with a group of friends and try the other dishes as well."}
{"text":"Food is ok.  Nothing great, typical steak house food, could go anywhere and get the same thing for less money. We were her for a bachelor party, the owner comes to the table ask says hello and asks to say something to the bachelor. Everybody at the table gets quite thinking he was gonna say something nice or a toast, and he says, COULD YOU KEEP IT DOWN.  Then he walks away. Asked the waitress if we could talk to him again he said he would,did not come back. Saw him as we were walking out, asked to see him, walks away said he is busy. Called us \"dirty Indians\"as we were walking out.  Thanks for showing us your true colors."}
{"text":"Ce fut ma troisieme visite Chez Ce très Dispendieux steak house.  Les deux première fois j'ai été déçu de pas mal tout.  La réservation a été faite avec opentable et la réservation a été bien faite. Contrairement aux deux autres fois, je n'ai pas attendu dans le salon avant d'avoir ma table. Ça commence bien avec une table près de la fenêtre. Au lieu de commander une bouteille de vin a prix de fou, j'ai décider de commander du vin au verre. Un sauvignon blanc (14$ le verre) pour nos entrées de fruits de mer et un cabernet (16$) pour nos steaks. Le cocktail de crevettes géantes de ma conjointe était correct. Crevettes énormes et fraîches. Mon crab cake malheureusement contenait plus de féculant que de crabe. Très gênant pour un restaurant d'une telle réputation.  Belle présentation mais pour la qualité, ont repassera. Le filet mignon et crevettes de ma conjointe était savoureux pour une pièce de viande qui n'a pas habituellement pas beaucoup de goût. De mon côté j'ai choisi le steak frites.  Excellent choix. Viande bien assaisonné et déjà coupé en lanières. Tendre et savoureux. Les frites sont fraîches mais j'en ai mangé des meilleures dans des snacks bar. Le service fut très professionnel comme prévu. Le maître d'hôtel se présente aux tables des clients réguliers mais ne s'abaisse pas a venir s'enquérir de notre satisfaction. En résumé je ne surprendrai personne en disant que les prix sont exagérés. Tant qu'à moi il y a d'aussi bons restaurants ou il est possible de manger un bon steak a la moitié du prix. Le Keg est un très bon exemple."}
{"text":"Meat looks burnt at first sight, but juicy and quality. Service was good, recommended for a try. They have great wine selection as well."}
{"text":"If your a meat lover, it's the place to go. They simply have the best steaks in a variety of cuts. I came many times and was never disappointed. My favorite is the marinated shish kabob, the meat is so tender and tasty.  As soon as you are seated they offer you the Moishe's famous cole slaw, pickels and an assortment of bread.  All meals include a choice of a side dish, you have to try the Monte Carlo potato it's just great. Its a bit Pricey but worth every penny. The service is fast and efficient."}
{"text":"I don't know why people would rate this place 5 star, even it doesn't deserve a 2 in terms of service. We went to this place bunch young people. They treated us like second class citizen. They didn't pay attention to our table AT ALL!!!!! and they didn't take us seriously. The service WAS SO DAMN TERRIBLE that when the server came..............she didn't even bother going to the other side of the table to service the water to each person properly. She wanted to cut corners & kept pouring water from this corner of the table to the other end of the table without  even asking if we wanted more water.......Moishe's management pay attention when a customer ask question about your after 9pm menu IT DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE CHEAP & definitely it DOES NOT GIVE YOUR STAFF THE RIGHT to treat them disrespectfully...............I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!!!!"}
{"text":"Moishe's was awesome. We went there for the late night special, which is a STEAL of a deal. I got the filet mignon, which was delicious and perfectly cooked. I can't remember what cut my bf got, but he loved his also. The sides were delicious (especially the cheesy mashed potatoes - can't remember what they're called). We even sat next to Macaulay Culkin! The service was great. My main complaint was that the place appeared to be filled with a bunch of young kids on their way to the clubs. People were in entirely inappropriate clothes (think graphic tees, cut up jeans, tennis shoes, hats, etc.). And they were LOUD! I'm not an old fogey at all, but man, I felt like I was watching Jersey Shore in real life!"}
{"text":"I come here quite often and love the late night menu before a weekend night out. The service is always great they try and accommodate any request you may have. One of the best steaks in Montreal which is saying a lot because Montreal know its steak. Have always had the steak cooked to perfection. The coleslaw is the best i have had and the Monte Carlo potato is the only thing you should have with your steak. Great selection of wine and they will make any drink you may want. Very classy and they know how to make every visit a great dining experience."}
{"text":"quite simply, this restaurant is an institution. great service, old school atmosphere and fantastic food. i like the casual atmosphere not common in fancy steak restaurants. make sure you get the signature potato side. amazing."}
{"text":"Overall, this is said to be an institution in Montreal. We came here for a business dinner with high hopes, but a few things were not to our liking.  For one, the tables were tightly packed. We were a party of 8 and they squeezed us to a side, abutting a wall. We were spilling into each other's space, plus almost backing into the diners in the next tables... so it wasn't comfortable and definitely difficult when anyone had to go to the restrooms. Because of this the noise level was high; one can without much effort hear snatches of conversations in the adjacent tables.  We had the the prime cut but I found the cooking ordinary and nothing to crow about. I've had better steaks... including at The Keg for example. Portions were too huge by my reckoning so there was inadvertent wastage.  But I felt that the worst part was the service. The waiter was an elderly gentleman who appeared a bit jaded. He was inattentive to our needs, and did not make any effort to engage with us. No efforts either to introduce us to the menu or to find out preferences etc. And he was unsmiling throughout the evening. I would expect much higher service quality for the price we paid! I don't think I will come back again."}
{"text":"Come here for the late night $25 special and nothing else, because that's how much they actually worth.  I have bookmarked this for a long time and thought this is a high end steak house. No no no! The waitress was super ignorance, did not give us a single smile after we got seated. Recommend a really bad wine that didn't pair with my steak at all.  We got the $45 Sunday menu with salmon appetizer, rib steak and chocolate cake.  The salmon was really bland.  The steak was ok, cooked well, seasoned well, but seemed like a low end cut as it was full of tendons.  The chocolate cake was just a slice of store bought frozen cake.  Super disappointing and ruined our night.  Will not come back.  Do yourself a favour and go to other steak houses."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed that they have cut the 9pm late night specials. I went there for my birthday and they did NOTHING to compensate because they used to have it every day and now they cut it to a more expensive option. My friends had a tight budget and we didn't expect this change. Again, they did NOTHING to compensate."}
{"text":"The Steak was okay with no dish design nothing ! Just a big filet mignon in a middle of a plate which I didn't mind it since I like simplicity and the mashed potato was amazing  ! But the staff were surprisingly mean  ! They barely came to our table to see if we need anything since they were busy having a celebrity person as a customer next to our table ( hockey player ) ! I won't recommend this place since there are other steak houses that the food is good and even better and the staffs are at least respectful"}
{"text":"One of my favorite steakhouse in Montreal.  Everytime my boyfriend and I come for dinner the service is always great and the food is delicious.  We always come after 9 pm for their $25 late night menu between Thursday to Saturday."}
{"text":"This review is made by a born and raised Alberta beef eater. This restaurant is in my top 3 steakhouses in Montreal. The service is extremely professional and welcoming.  Typically a restaurant that services all the local celebs.  This is definitely a restaurant to be at at least once a month.  Yummy"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had period.  The staff was too busy socializing with each other, very rude.  Inconsistent information provided lead to an absolute horrible experience.  I try to be considerate to those around me always, clearly the staff does not share quality.  I've never written a bad review ever but I must say I felt compelled to share my sentiments.  Mean rude inconsiderate and most of all misleading nasty management."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse in town great for bar and bar mitzvahs and other events you will always enjoy Monte Carlo baked potatoes with sirloin steak waiters are very quick and professional polite and well dressed I got a say this is the best restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great experience overall! We went for the dinner special for a birthday on a busy Saturday night and were not disappointed. The portion sizes (especially for the prices) were quite large, and the service was prompt and courteous. We received pickles, house made bread and coleslaw to start, and they were a perfect start to the meal. The house salad and Caesar salad appetizers were well dressed, and the homemade croutons were a nice addition. For our main courses we had steak frites, the rack of lamb, and the chicken special. All of the dishes came with either a plain or stuffed baked potato, or fries. Our server made excellent suggestions and offered us substitutions for our meal choices. The seasonings and condiments complimented the meals nicely - the only flaw was the excessive amount of salt in the dishes. We received coffee or tea with our meal, and the birthday guest received a slice of decadent chocolate cake as well. We were VERY satisfied customers and we will definitely be returning! This is a great place for families, and groups - it's a busy, and exciting place to go. 4.5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"My brother and I came here for their after 9pm special... and delaying our dinner was totally worth it.  The ambience is loud.  The interior is very classy and most people were wearing dress shirts.  However, everyone was friendly.  We talked to the group next to us.    Also, our waiter was delighted to help us choose our entrees and wine.   Get their rack of lamb with dijon rosemary sauce!  Best lamb I've ever tasted.  Don't like lamb?  Their steak is also amazing.  The after 9pm menu has a lot of options.  Alaskan king crab cakes!  If I were to come back to visit Montreal, you will find me here."}
{"text":"I went for the $25 deal after 9pm on a thursday. I made an online reservation for 9:15pm, but we still had to wait 35 minutes to get seated. When we got there, the place was really packed. So you'll probably want to make a reservation if you're going.   I ordered the Rib Steak. It wasn't really the best steak i ever had. It was okay. Not worth $55 in my opinion if you come on a regular time. Little bit too salty and more chewing than i expected for this type of restaurant.   But the Filet mignon was good. I would definitely get the Filet Mignon. It's very tender and not a lot of chewing. And the baked mash potato is good too.   The service was very slow, which is kind of expected when the whole place is packed.   I would come back here for the $25 deal after 9pm, but never for the regular hours for the expensive price.   Food 4 stars Service 2.5 stars  Overall I'll give it a 3 stars."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if we came on an \"OFF night\" but our experience here was far from stellar. Perhaps, I was guilty for allowing myself to be lured into the after 9PM deal and had a high expectation after reading all the reviews.  We made a reservation at 9:45, got there around 9:40, checked in with the hostess and waited with 40+ people in the small bar/lobby. It was close to 10:10 when our name was finally called, we noticed that people who had a reservation for 10:15pm seating was seated at the same time as us (perhaps it was just our luck?!).  Our table was jammed to the wall, chairs and tables were very close to each other (back of the chair touched other diner's chair), certainly no personal space, not to forget to mention, the whole dining area was LOUD, very loud! Nice chandelier, fancy looking restaurant, but way too loud, more like a bar than a fine dining restaurant. I wonder if the atmosphere would be different if we would have come before 9pm (do they move some tables out?? doubtful).  Three waiters passed by our table, noticed us with the HUGE menu books, but nobody came to greet or take our order until 15-20 minutes after we sat down. I noticed at least 3 other tables seated after us got their orders taken first, perhaps, we got a bad spot?   While waiting, we munched on the bread, coleslaw and dills that were on the table. Coleslaw was really good, not too sweet, great crunch, delicious!  We both ordered the Rib Steak, medium rare for our main course and I opted for the salmon tartare for appetizer while hubby ordered the caesar salad.  The food came out VERY quickly.. surprising.  Hubby's caesar's salad was very mildly dressed. The dressing didn't have the typical \"anchovy\" flavor... it was more like romaine lettuce with grated parmesan cheese. It was ok. The salmon tartare was beautifully plated. The salmon tasted fresh and not fishy, but it needed a pinch of salt. I squeezed some lemon and it helped brought out the flavor.   Our Rib steak arrived.. looked very promising. The first 5 bites were delicious! The steak was perfectly seasoned. However, we then noticed the inconsistency on the meat... the middle part was way too blue, we flipped over and there was no grill mark on the other side. Part of hubby's steak was still \"moo-ing,\" mine was not as bad. The meat was also very poor in quality, there was way too much gristles, hard to cut (and swallow), very tough and chewy. No waiter to flag down and it was around 11, we were tired so didn't make a fuss about it. Rib Eye is our favorite cut, we always order this cut when we eat steak. For once, we didn't finish our steak and didn't even want a takeout box for the leftover.  We shared a side of their monte carlo potato. This was the star of the meal! It was basically twice baked potato, seasoned perfectly, creamy, rich, super good! Must get this if you come to Moishe's, their BEST item!  Overall, $25 late dinner deal did not impress us, the service was also very bad. Nobody checked on us during dinner, we couldn't get our waiter's attention to the point that we had to ask the \"water girl\" to tell our waiter to get our bill. Even when she told him, it took another 15 minutes until the bill arrived. There are so many great restaurants in Montreal, so if you're a tourist, this is not a \"must visit\" place.  My advice to future diners... if you want a good steak, forget their $25 deal and try their regular steak menu..perhaps you'll truly have a better meal...and hope you get luckier than us on the service!"}
{"text":"Determined  to have a non hipster old skool experience we arrived at 5.30:pm so we could be first in and first out whilst observing the arrivals.  cocktails - methinks not, had to send back a french 75 that was served up like sex on the beach with ice and sweet and sour on club soda = and a gin gimlet with enough sweet and sour to stun  I dont know what.  Awful.  The room is great, old school with a good fellas vibe Our neighbors were kinda new jersey and talked about snoring in bed and fought alnight with each other The waiters loiter without direction The maitre d chews gum The shrimp cocktail for $21 has 5 shrimp, seriously laughing right now My $67 fillet mignon - so mediocre Pablos salmon - huge and good value but way overcooked Champginons - just ok Mille Feuille - creamy soft and mushy, pastry soggy and no layers $-300 - our survey says if you can afford to part with your money and laugh then its A-OK  Montreal continues to disappoint in the food scene  and so to bed"}
{"text":"I've dined at my fair share of steakhouses worldwide, and Moishe's is about average. We made reservations based on an internet list of \"notable places to eat in Montreal\". My general observation is that Yelp reviews in Canada are somewhat off, if not inaccurate. One positive was that the restaurant is relatively inexpensive per person. Our reservations were pre-9pm menu and the pricing was great in comparison to what I'm used to paying at upmarket steakhouses.  We made reservations for a large party online and even with last minute changes they were very pleasant and accommodating. Across the board, our party agreed that the steaks served were bland, could've used a little more seasoning and could've been delivered at warmer temperatures. The other items were fine.   Another thing that kind of ruined the mood was possibly ignorance on the part of the manager and hopefully nothing else. This manager went out of his way to check on our party multiple times during our visit to ensure that  we were okay, a fantastic gesture indeed. We were a large party, all males, in our mid-thirties. The manager must have called us \"boys\" at least four times and this is inexcusable. The race element aside, we are grown men and professionalism calls for proper treatment."}
{"text":"Went here with my husband for their evening menu and I could not get over how busy the place was at 10pm!! There was still a line up out the door. I honestly didn't expect the food to be as delicious as their usual menu but I was quickly proven wrong. I was able to cut through my steak with a fork, the wine was fantastic and the sides were to die for.  I can't wait to go back. If you aren't into dropping $$$$$$$$$$$ for a supper, I would definitely suggest you check out their evening menu. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went for 29 after 9 so I can only comment on that menu, but it was overall a lovely experience. If you're not really the meat type (like me) you'll find this place a bit boring food-wise, but I guess it's worth a one time visit.  The pickles lived up the to hype, they are easily the best I've ever had and I struggled to leave one on the plate so as not to look crazy. The coleslaw was coleslaw and appetizers were alright, not extraordinary, note that the salmon tartare is an incredibly tiny portion!  I had the lamb which was cooked to perfection, super tender and had a nice charcoal taste although it was extremely salty. The sauce that came with it was irrelevant. My boyfriend had the ribeye which he says was really good (still a bit salty to my taste I'd say). Monte Carlo potato was awesome, fried onions were a fun addition.  So it's a nice place for a late night dinner or special date thing, wouldn't go for the regular price."}
{"text":"A veryyyy Below than average experience for me personally!!! I don't get why this place is so raved up about! Everyone always kept bugging me to try this resto and If I have not tried it that I was not a true montrealer... *sigh* **rolling my eyes** literally so stupid! The place is super old and doesn't have any appeal im not kidding it looks outdated! The stairs have carpet and it's not that fancy.  The waiters are very annoying. NO PRIVACY whatsoever. They stare at you like hawks waiting to see when you're just about to finish. There's about 10 waiters all packed and stand all together just looking at what you're doing or what you're saying. It was so awkward and Im not comfortable with that at all!  The food was even more terrible. I ordered the wild mushroom salad and it was so burnt I couldn't eat it. It was so bitter ughh gross ! The grilles veggies were burned as well and my steak .. Was so overdone I felt like this place is a huge scam! No quality at all. They just put on a facade to fool you into thinking its authentic and pure quality resto but in general it's a huge scam! Food and service was a disaster.   The price .. Let's not even talk about the price because it doesn't deserve half of what they are charging. Im not against heavy pricing if its well deserved and a lot of quality is present to coincide with the price .. However, this place is such a dump it's not worth a dime!   Never ever coming back to this place again!"}
{"text":"Ate at Moishe's with my wife and daughter on a visit to Montreal on New Years Day. My daughter had the steak frites and she said it was good, not great.  I tried it and agreed: it was a good strip steak with very good fries.  My wife had a nice piece of fish that she also enjoyed.  I had the dry-aged strip.  It was the best steak I've ever had and I've been to many of NY's best steak houses.  It was perfectly cooked, good dark crust (not just grill marks), and had all the buttery, nutty, sweet beefy complexity that you could hope for in a great steak.  I totally enjoyed the Monte Carlo potato, a double baked stuffed job. I liked the primal nature of it all: they serve the steak on a white plate with no garnish, no clutter; same with the potato.  They are so essential they don't need shmears of sauce or clumps of parsley to distract.  Once you cut into the steak and the juices start to flow that's all the garnish you need.  Another stand out for me were sour pickles and rye bread that were brought free to the table along with a nice fresh cole slaw.  If you had dropped me blindfolded somewhere and fed these to me I would be certain that I was on the Lower East.  The pickle is garlicky and salty and as perfect as any pickle that came out of a wooden barrel on Essex Street. Same for the rye bread with its crackling brick oven crust an dense chewy caraway-studded crumb.  I am usually annoyed by inflated ratings on Yelp and I don't think I've given a 5 star rating yet (I usually even reserve 4 stars for really good places).  But Moishe's hit all the right notes for me in terms of comfort, decor, service, and food quality and execution."}
{"text":"Went here because most the reviews were raving about this place. My boyfriend and I went here to celebrate our anniversary. The food was slightly above average only because of their special mashed potatoes (can't remember what it's called) what I'm most disappointed it is the service. Our waiter wasn't attentive at all, he was more of the type of waiting for you to get his attention versus him checking in on us every so often. Nothing really screamed out this place is special."}
{"text":"Being hairy manly men who love their meat, my travel companion and I had high expectations of Moishe's. Moishe's did not disappoint.  Our meat was juicy, tender, marbled, charred crispy on the outside, dripping blood just below the seared layer. But for $45-$60 per slab, one should expect nothing less. I actually preferred the rack of lamb, which was served with a delicious dijon vinaigrette.   The sides were what exceeded expectations. After ordering, the table gets huge trays of bread and butter, house pickles and coleslaw.  The bread was average and i thought it was bizarre that they put ice over the butter. The pickles were flavorful and crunchy, and the coleslaw was crisp and garlicky. These two were amazing by themselves, and the acidity balanced the fatty meats perfectly.    The potato that accompanies the meat was phenomenal. It was creamy, fluffy, herbed, and crunchy on top. The skin on the bottom was toasted and seasoned. I already love plain baked or boiled potatoes, you see. So this dish took me to a higher plane of love. Like maybe bordering on godly love.  Also, the servers were prompt and courteous. I like the way they just came around to do their business without being solicitous. They also gave us extra sides when we asked them to wrap up the leftovers. Unspoken random kindness, which was much appreciated."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a very nice meal at Moishes.  Service was very good throughout the meal and the mains came out very quick, perhaps even a bit too quick.  I had the Natural Dry Aged Ribeye and it was very good.  I ordered it rare, the server suggested medium rare, I nodded \"ok\" then it came out kind of blue.  I took a bite and realized it was going to eat very well at that doneness (it was delicious) but for someone who won't eat a blue steak... they would have to send it back.  My wife's petite filet came out a perfect medium rare and was tasty as well.  Sides were good and the pickles were fantastic.  Overall we loved the old school vibe, attentive service and the food.  A couple of bobbles from being 5 stars but still recommended."}
{"text":"Great steakhouse. Service was real good. It was super busy on Saturday night, great energy and atmosphere. We loved every bit of our culinary experience."}
{"text":"Moishes is my fav steak house..... Ive been here many times... always great service.. amazing steak !!!! and good sides..  ok fine its expensive.. VERY expensive.. we once spent like $1k on group of 5 people.. Go at 9pm if u want to do $25 menu.... Some people say Que or Gibbys but I say NO.. both of those places can go to shredders.."}
{"text":"This place is part of my top 5 places to go in Montreal!  (Visit my page to read my other top 5 reviews!)  When people ask me to introduce myself, I tell them I am a carnivore and I love steak!  I remember saving up for an opportunity to try this place when I was working part time. Extremely expensive, but definitely worth going. My absolute favorite cut is the New York. When my steak came, I was beyond excited. It was cooked to perfection and rested for just the right amount of time. The moment my knife cut into it, juice filled my plate. One of the best experiences I have had in Montreal. My friend had gotten the filet mignon and she could not stop raving about it.   Highly recommended but be aware that it is quite expensive for what you pay for!"}
{"text":"It's the best Steakhouse I've been too. Maybe more 4 1/2 stars  Quickly: Not cheap, portions are okay, service is professional and quick. BEst Pickle ever, best service and clean. The decor is chic and has a old 40-50's montreal style.   the only down side, is that I've requeted a blue filet mignon. Blue is difficult to achieve it correctly because, a GOOD blue cooking is warm and slightly cook outside"}
{"text":"Up there as one of the most iconic steakhouses in Montreal, there's no wonder Moishe's has been around for over 50 years. With its timeless charm and debonair decor, you feel like you've been transported to a world where the small things don't matter, and where the most important thing on your mind is what you're going to order.   But first things first. The second you sit down, you're greeted with bottomless pickles the size of your forearm and the tangiest coleslaw you've ever tasted. Of course there's fresh bread, and guess what? It's amazing as well. Now, on to the steak.   I ordered the filet mignon, blue. It was probably the first time that the kitchen got the cook right on their first attempt. When I tell you that this is a rare occurrence, I'm not talking about the cook. It wasn't rare, it wasn't medium, but actually, without flaw, blue. Delicious.  Paired with their Monte Carlo potato and beautiful bottle of red, the whole experience was about as decadent as they come."}
{"text":"Visited Moishe's earlier this summer for the first time in many years - I had been a frequent patron years back when my family was based in the city.  I was surprised (and aggravated) to find that a monte carlo potato no longer comes free with the other of a main dish - it always had in the past.  Despite that nuisance I had to give the restaurant five stars.  My boyfriend and I made a reservation to drop in on a Thursday night to take advantage of the late night special - an appetizer, a main course and a coffee/tea for $25.  This is honestly unbeatable for a meal (and service) of this quality.  I had the salmon tartare (a tiny portion but offset by the size of my main), the special chicken, and a cup of tea.  We also ordered some wine and drinks - the meal came out to about $80 which felt like a steal given how full and happy we both were.  I guess the moral of the story is, no matter how much of a rip off a luxury meal can feel like it is, when you are getting a deal like that you really don't mind paying an extra few dollars for that amazing side dish and a nice glass of wine."}
{"text":"Went there for the after 9 menu and it was just OK.  Service seemed rushed and the food wasn't plated aesthetically   ( i guess that's what you get when you pay less than 20.00 USD for filet and apps.  The cookie dessert was hard and seemed old.  I did like the complimentary coleslaw and pickles.  Bathrooms were a bit inconvenient as the ladies had to go up a tiny set of stairs and bump to each other if 2 people were going the opposite way."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a \"classic\" place to cross of your list, eat here.   If you're looking for a good meal, think twice.    My wife and I have been traveling around Montreal this weekend, visiting as many \"classics\" as possible.  Although Moishes had mixed reviews we decided to give it a try.    PROS: -Friendly staff -Quick service (too quick?) -$25 menu after 9 for those on a budget -Coleslaw and pickles were great as a small starter   CONS -Steak sauce readily available. I've never seen this at a steakhouse.  Let your meat speak for itself.   -my steak was way too rare for a medium rare.  Reheat was dry and bland and overdone.  Would has preferred a new steak -hamburger meat was very well done and on the dry side -cramped and loud  I'm glad I was able to cross this off my list.  For those that are looking for a quality steak house with great ambiance, head over to GIBBYS  (Try to)enjoy!"}
{"text":"3.5**  We came at around 10:00 on a Friday to take advantage of the after 9:00 deal. I'm not sure if other reviewers mentioned it but the price increased from 25$ to 29$. Not a huge deal but just saying.  We were first seated right near the entrance. It was one of the worst tables in the place so I asked if we would be able to move. The manager (I think?) warned us that the other table available was in a squishy location. I hesitated but finally decided to move. That was a great decision since our second table was cozy, quieter and much more to my liking.   They quickly brought us bread, pickles and coleslaw but no water. The coleslaw is to die for and although I'm not a huge fan of pickles, these are pretty great. The bread was cold and hard so when the waiter came, I asked for a different basket. He was really nice and said he'd be right back. The issue is, we didn't see him again. Nobody came to our table for like 10 more minutes and this time we had a different waiter. We still hadn't gotten water. I asked the second waiter if we could have a new bread basket and he seemed slightly irritated, stating that the bread is fresh and is made the day of. He reluctantly got us a different one.  The food itself was good. We both had caesar salads and rib steaks. We were going to share the rib steak and the rack of lamb but we were relieved that we didn't when we saw the lamb at a table next to ours. It looked like a really tiny portion.  The salads were nothing special. It was fine but not more than that. This was the first time in months that I had a steak (I try to cut down on meat as much as possible). It was delicious. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. It seemed much smaller than the last time I was here however. I wouldn't know for sure but I think it is smaller than the rib steak on their normal menu.  The service was not great. I found our waiter to not be the friendliest. I find that there is a difference in the service you get before 9:00 vs after 9:00. Yes, the clientele is surely different. This however, is no reason to treat clients differently. In my opinion, comparing my experience yesterday to a time I went with my family at 6:30, there was a difference. Our waiter said they were short-staffed as we were paying and apologized so maybe it was just an off-night.   Even with the price change, it is a great value and a nice place for a fancy date (on a budget). There is a great charm about it and the restaurant is decorated really nicely. Very classy experience. Only complaint is that some tables are really on top of each other.  Service: 2/5 Atmosphere: 4/5 Food:3.5/5 Value:4/5 (after 9 wed-sat)"}
{"text":"My cousin picked this restaurant for his birthday and 4 of us went for their \"late night\" menu. The night menu starts from 9pm and goes to midnight every Thursday through Saturday. For just $25, you get an appetizer, a main course and a coffee or tea.   We had a reservation but still had to wait 10 min. This was fine though, since they have a nice sitting area and a bar where you can get a drink while you wait for your table.  As soon as the waiter sat us, he brought some free pickles, cole slaw and bread. They were fun to start with. I had the salmon tartare as an appetizer and the rib steak for my main course. The salmon tartare was ordinary, nothing special, but the rib steak was very flavourful, tender, perfectly cooked and sooo big. I could have easily shared it with someone else, no wonder they don't serve it with a side! Although we still got some fried onions and spinach to share to add some variety. Every side is $5. The french fried onions come in large portions as well, so getting one for two is easily enough. They were super thin and very crispy. For the spinach it was just normal saute, nothing special, but good.   Overall, this is a great place if you're craving for a big piece of meat and don't wanna pay too much (unless you get wine, then it's not cheap). The room is very big, so it's good for groups as well, and the service in general was good."}
{"text":"Moishes is not the 5 star, once in a lifetime experience I wanted it to be. For the price, it's not good enough."}
{"text":"A few friends and I came here on a Saturday night for the after 9pm special for my bachelor party weekend.  Everything was delicious.  I had the salmon tartare for my appetizer and the filet mignon for my main course and it was cooked perfectly.  The after 9pm special is great because you can enjoy the same delicious meal with an appetizer for almost half of what it would normally cost.  It's definitely worth it and I hope to someday come back here.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Classy Old School Jewish Steakhouse.   You definitely need to call in and make reservations for Moishe's.  Even so, expect to wait.   My friends and I came here for dinner on Saturday night.  I was impressed at how many people were waiting to be seated (it's not a small place in the least bit).  The restaurant also had a doorman.   We ordered two bottles of California Cabernets, which weren't that great, but it's our fault for choosing not so great bottles.  I thought it was interesting how they put ice on top of the butter for the bread.  We had sauteed spinach and grilled oyster mushrooms as our appetizers.   I ordered the rib eye ($50-something) and it was a ginormous 22 ounce cut!  Wish I had known b/c that's too much steak for even this steak eater.  It's definitely enough to feed to grown men.  The rib eye was charred on the outside and cooked on a charcoal grill (no need to order this baby \"black & blue\").  The steak was good.  It oddly tasted even better the next morning as leftovers!"}

{"text":"I had the same review somewhere else so I just screenshot my review please check my pic. For me it's not even worth it to write a review it's a very bad restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh.My.God.  Where do I begin?  Dinner buddy and I recently came across the dine after nine website: dineafternine.ca  where normally high-end restaurants offer reduced-price menus for after 9pm and it's a total steal! We've decided we're going to hit as many of them as possible.  So we started with Moishe's Steak house, a real Montreal establishment. This is the kind of place where steaks START at $50 (there's a reason why prices aren't listed on their website), the kind of old-world style of steakhouse where businessmen usually come to end deals, like Peter Luger's for instance in Brooklyn.  The  after 9pm menu is far smaller than the main menu but nonetheless, it still gives you plenty of choices to have the whole Moishe's experience. I figured since I was going for the Rib steak, I wanted to start with something light and had the Caesar Salad. Nothing special but good nonetheless. My friend had the salmon tartare and loved it.  Both of us ordered Rib steaks and people, it's official, this is the place where you will eat literally the best steak of your life, no joke. Ask for the spices and garlic on top. Crusty on the outside and seared to perfection and made as you wish, I had mine medium-well and it was perfect.  Get the Monte Carlo potato,  the best double-baked potato there is between here and Idaho. The coleslaw, the pickles, the bread, all of it outstanding. Both of us somehow managed to still have some space left for dessert, I had the classic chocolate cake and my friend had the creme brulee. There was not a note out of place anywhere.  Moishe's has quite the reputation, while service is brisk, I'm happy that we ended up with a nice waiter. Nothing can turn a meal sour faster than a server with attitude. We ended up with the worst table, right by the door and kitchen but at least it gave us a great view of what was going on in the rest of the dining room and watch who else was strolling in.   People say that Moishe's is a fancy dress place. Honestly, I didn't see that much class on display. I saw some real slobs walk in, t-shirts hanging out of jeans, social X-rays and ahem, \"ladies of the night\", escorts with businessmen and guys who looked like frat boys. The noise level is very high indeed. I have to say watching the parade of people on display is a bit like watching a show, quite colorful and quite the experience. My friend and I decided that we'll come back if at least to try out the rack of lamb.  Seriously, just go."}
{"text":"The service was delightful, the potato possibly the best twice baked I've ever had, and the Mille Feuille dessert was heaven. (The third star was won by the dessert alone!) But the steak was just ok. We had the special 45-day aged bone-in Rib Eye. They cut it off the bone for you and reassemble it. It was cooked to temp (med rare) but otherwise... just ok. Not juicy (the dry aging must have an impact) and no real flavoring. I'm not one to say you should over season a perfectly good steak, but the strongest flavor was simply the charcoal from their proudly charcoal-only grill. A fellow Kansas Citian had recommended it to us, but many KC'rs will have had better and for much less."}
{"text":"Went there a few times with friends to try the after 9 menu. Every time, we had to wait around 45 minutes to be seated, and we had a reservation every time. Stills, the wait is always worth it.  I tried 2 different starters: the chopped liver and the salmon tartare. Of the two, I prefer the tartare, which tastes really fresh (always a good sign). I never really liked to eat liver, maybe that is why I prefer the tartare.  For main course, I had the ribsteak, rare, with a Monte Carlo potato. The potato is a must! I don't know what they do with it, but I think I am addicted to that potato.  Service is really courteous and efficient. Will definitely come again many times in the future!"}
{"text":"Went for the late night menu after seeing it on an episode of Late Nite Eats.  We were excited to try the filet mignon poutine, but were told it is no longer available (it is still on the menu on the website).   As this was our primary goal for the visit (four day Montreal Poutine tour) it already set a negative tone for the visit, however it was the service (or lack of) and food that really made the visit unpleasant.  We had one visit from our waiter (at the end of the meal), though someone did come by to refill our water a few times.    The pickles, coleslaw and bread they bring to the table were as you would expect.  We have had Moishes pickles and coleslaw from Costco and this is basically the same.   Since the Poutine wasn't an option, we opted to try a few different things - the filet, chicken, rib steak and salmon.   The chicken tasted amazing.  Clearly the winner of the night, but the way it was prepared on the bone made it a little difficult to get at some of the meat.  Otherwise, tender, flavourful, a bit of char - the rest of the table was envious.   The filet should have been the highlight, as this is a steakhouse.  It was slightly overcooked, though a nice piece of meat, but very little flavour. For how much flavour the chicken had, they seemed to be afraid of seasoning on the filet.   The salmon was reasonably portioned, but there was no seasoning.  In the thickest part of the cut the fish was undercooked, with a strong fishy flavour and slimy texture.  The rest was cooked well, but without seasoning this was a disappointment.   The rib steak was super thin, which resulted in a very inconsistent cook near the bone.  Parts were very overcooked and near the bone was raw.  This is a typical poor cook on a thin steak, but any quality steakhouse would know this.  The steak was heavily salted, but again, due to the thin cut all you could taste was salt.   We ordered the rib steak with crispy onions, but they were very sweet, but otherwise no seasoning.  They were crispy, but chalky and unseasoned.  They were left virtually untouched on the table.   The Monte Carlo potato also has no seasoning and ended up with a 'boxed mashed potato' texture.  This also was left on the table with little more than a bite or two.     When the bus boy came to clear our plates he asked how the meal was we indicated that it was only 'okay' and he laughed, looked at my chicken bones and said 'looks like it' then took the plates and walked away.     We had tea after the meal, basic red rose orange pekoe, nothing special.   For a steakhouse with such a reputation, it was extremely disappointing.  I'm glad we did the discounted late night menu, if we had paid the regular rate this would be only one star.    We are no stranger to steak houses.  We have eaten at places like Ruth's Chris, Mortons, Hy's, Harbour 60, Schula's... This place doesn't even rank at the level of The Keg.  They are at best Le Biftek with Ruth's Chris pricing."}
{"text":"We came here with a group as part of our cultural experience in Montreal, hoping it would be representative of the city's historically vibrant Jewish community. Instead, it was a series of cliches stitched together with mediocre food and lackluster service.   When we arrived, our table was not quite ready, so we waited in the dimly-lit vestibule filled with artifacts from years past. The old menus and photographs were charming and helped explain some of the restaurant's success: clearly they are coasting on a longtime reputation for quality, although they are not upholding it today.  Upon being seated, we were presented with bread and pickles, both huge dill pickles and a mayonnaise-free cole slaw. I know this is their trademark and they won't ever change it, but I don't think a giant pickle is an appropriate amuse-bouche for a steak dinner, and the coleslaw was much too sweet to be enjoyable (the caraway seeds were a nice touch, though.) The waiter answered our questions with as few words and as much condescension as possible: when we asked what made the Special Chicken \"Special\" he rattled off a list of ingredients, and when my husband asked for a wine list he brought him an iPad with the reserve list (hundreds or thousands of dollars per bottle) instead of pointing out that the normal-priced selections were on a different page of the menu. He opted for a cocktail instead.  Our appetizers came: the salmon tartare was very small, the cesar salad overdressed and the house salad uneventful. A long wait for our main courses. The Special Chicken was decent, but overly sweet (a pinch of sugar in the dry rub is nice, but this was practically caramelized!) The steaks were decent as well, though one was underdone and when my friend sent it back it arrived overdone. The best steak restaurants I have visited will confirm your preference so that you know what to expect (medium will have a warm pink center, etc.) but as I mentioned, our waiter couldn't be bothered. Sides are not included, but my husband and I shared a monte carlo potato for $5, which passable but not wonderful. We skipped dessert, and as we were waiting for our check, we heard two separate disagreements over bills at neighboring tables (not shouting matches, but loud enough to be heard.) It didn't bode well, but thankfully everything was in order.  Moishe's idea of an after-9 menu with lower prices is an excellent one, but I imagine their goal is to whet our tastebuds for the finery we can expect at other hours. Instead, it cut every possible corner, from portions to service. We had a great time at dinner because we're all good friends and took the missteps in stride, but I didn't experience anything that would make me want to return even for a bargain meal, let alone a full-priced one. Good food is easy to find in Montreal at any price point, but not here!"}
{"text":"Fiddler on the Main.       Moishe's has always been one of the best steakhouses in town but in the past year it has become one of the best deals in town as well. If you are ever looking for exquisite cuts of meat, some of the worlds best slaw/pickles and a warm environment with a welcoming feel, on The Main, this is the place.      It is as old as the hills but that is not the vibe. Newly appointed Chef Josh Fiddler has put a great spin on a classic menu with new presentations to their staples and additions that are critical in 'keeping up with the times'. Moreover, the 9-midnight menu, which is teetering on being the best deal in town, has the place busy till close Thursday through Saturday. Anytime you can get two courses, one being a steak, for $25, it is a good bet. To top it off, it is Moishe's beef and you can grab one at 11:15pm if you are so inclined...then paint the town...      I've hit up the 9-12 a few times and have never been disappointed, the Lobster roll was feckin' fantastic as are the tartars. Bottom line, you can go Moishe's whenever with whoever and have a excellent dining experience.   Waka Waka"}
{"text":"Went to Moishe's to try their friday/saturday after 9 menu + celebrate my 22nd birthday (Yay!)  We had a reservation at 9:30 but weren't sat down until 9:50. The restaurant entrance was completely packed; guess we weren't the only ones trying to score a 30$ filet mignon.  I ended up getting my filet only 30 minutes later (super quick service). The piece of meat was amazing although I would've appreciated a bit of seasoning on it. The Monte Carlo potato was simple and amazing- worth it for an extra 5$. Definitely would recommend to go try their after 9 worth it as the quality/price report is pretty good. However, if you're looking for a 4-5 star dining experience, you probably should stick to a decent dinner time as they seem to overbook the restaurant to really take every penny they can from this special. From what I have seen/experienced, Moishe's is a good traditional Montreal steakhouse and you should probably try it out at least once :)"}
{"text":"Rather disappointing! Rude hostess (terrible start), disorganized service (the staff simply could keep it together during the service), and just a very mediocre experience. Nice decor, but the food was subpar (do not recommend the tartare, and I felt that the steak was just average). It was a bit too much of an unapologetic 'holier than thou' vibe. While I can deal with all that, it's the simply unconcerned attitude that's simply disheartening, considering I wanted to like this place so much, for a place that touts itself as a go-to Montreal eatery."}
{"text":"We came up for a long weekend and our friend suggested we stop by this old school steakhouse.  At around 5pm we easily secured a 7pm reservation on a Saturday night.  This made me suspicious.  The place was surprisingly packed with families and children.  They begin by giving us bread, pickles and a vinegar based slaw.  I started with an order of chopped liver.  An overly generous portion for one person.  It was served with some fried onions.  Unfortunately, not knowing it came with fried onions I had ordered fried onions to be served along with our mains.  It would have been nice to have been forewarned by the waiter.  My wife started with a caesar salad that had an overly generous amount of shredded dried parmesan cheese on top.  I am not one to usually be repulsed by generous amounts of cheese but was quite surprised by the amount on her salad.  We ordered some latkes to taste with our mains.  Once again we were served a very generous portion of very deep fried latkes.  They tasted slightly sweet in a carnival fried zeppoli kind of way.  I think we each ate half of one and discarded the other 8.  I think I had a bone in ribeye steak.  Not very memorable.  Wife had a filet mignon that was trememdous.  It was interesting to go to an old school steakhouse on our first night in Montreal but I would not return.    I should have listened to the advice of several internet blogs and forums which suggested avoiding steakhouses in Montreal."}
{"text":"Warm mushroom salad, complimentary coleslaw and pickles are good. Thats the end of my list.   A Montreal institution, but it should stay in the past. In an effort to attract a younger crowd they have a special after 10. I brought a friend from out of town here and it was an embarrassing way to start the trip.  We were treated very poorly. The food wasnt very good, and we still ended up with a rather large bill. It seems like a good deal but the portions are so small it doesn't end up that way."}
{"text":"I came here with a group for New Years Eve while visiting Montreal. We had a reservation for 8:45, and were not seated until around 9:45. It was a busy night, I get it. The atmosphere was nice and the staff was very friendly. We had great service the entire night from both our waiter and the bartenders. The sides were amazing, however the steak was not impressive. Although mine was cooked perfectly (medium), it completely lacked flavor. For the price, it was definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"We had a small birthday celebration at Moishe's last night and enjoyed their Sunday special ($45 for appetizer -main-dessert). Overall, we thought the value was good. We were served, pickles, coleslaw and bread to start off with. The appetizers included marinated salmon ( it was a huge portion, but it tasted very much like ketchup) and soup that are not on the after 9 menu, but it didn`t have salmon tartare.  The house salad was also a nice big portion but not particularly special. The mains were the same as the after 9 menu and both the rack of lamb rib steak tasted fantastic. The desserts were a choice of millefeuille ( more like 2 feuilles with lots of cream), sorbet and chocolate cake.  Our server was fantastic. The ambiance could`ve been better. It gets really noisy when the room is crowded and in such a setting, I would`ve appreciated a bit of jazz in the background.   I could see why the $25 after 9 menu is so popular, but for people who want to eat at a normal hour, the Sunday menu is a nice alternative. We will keep it in mind for future special occasions."}
{"text":"One on my favourite restaurants all time. Hands down my favourite steakhouse so far. If you think it's expensive just reserve you table after 9pm on Thursdays to Saturdays - when they have the \"table d'hôte\" special for 25$. Yes the table d'hôte is a fix menu, but you end up having an amazing experience for about 1/3 of the regular price. I'm not a baller, a rapper, or a shot caller, but thanks to this special I can eat like Jayz in the cut.  Best coleslaw salad and Monte Carlo potato I ever had. The cheese cake is also very good."}
{"text":"There are few true Montreal institutions. Places that you, your parents, your grandparents... heck even maybe your great grandparents know about and respect for what they do. Moishes is one such a place. A place that evokes a certain timelessness and yet still works to this day. Up until last week, I had never been to Moishes. Yes... I know. A combination of factors really. Chief among them is that I am not really a steakhouse guy. I love meat but I can't tell you the last time I actually ordered a steak in a restaurant. If given the choice, I will always select something else off the menu. Steak is one of those things where I don't really see the point of paying a high premium. Just my perception but one that makes me choose to spend that money at a different restaurant than a steakhouse.   Moishes has a late night menu where for 25$, you get a entree, a main and coffee/tea. A steal of a deal... and a great way for me to finally try them. So away we go. The late night option includes the normal complimentary pickles, coleslaw and bread which at the time of our reservation was a welcomed sight. Add my usual old Fashioned cocktail and I was ready for a good late night meal on the Main.  As appetizers, we selected the salmon tartar and the caesar salad. Both were competent solid dishes. The salmon was not over-seasoned with just the right hint of dill. I would have liked it to be a bit bigger though. The salad portion was good and the dressing was the right combination of flavour without being too rich and creamy.  As mains, we went with the steak frites and the filet mignon poutine. The steak was perfectly cooked to order. The cut was leaner and thicker than the typical steak frites you get at the many restaurants in and around Montreal which was a slight surprise but good regardless. The fries were nice, golden and plentiful. Good crisp and seasoning as well.  The filet mignon poutine was something I had been curious to try and came away quite satisfied. Same golden fries as above topped with pieces of filet mignon and melted cheese. A very rich and filling dish. The real key here was the perfectly melted cheese that binds everything together into a delicious mess. Definitely a dish I will be having again.  My first experience at Moishes was a good one. A place where you see the attention to detail that 75 years in business provides. Great service from beginning to end, a nice dining room space and great food. I admit to be a little surprised to see how casual of dress some of the patrons were... especially when compared to the tables where people were in suits and dresses. Moishes is a place where I feel like a dress shirt is a requirement at minimum but regardless.... I waited a long time before finding coming to Moishes. The wait won't be that long next time.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"The latkes are worth a trip alone. Torn, cause the cut of meat was excellent but the charr and seasoning could use some improving. However, I was with a large group and the sides, service, drinks, and waiter were excellent. Worth a stop for steak while in Montreal"}
{"text":"Une expérience fantastique. La viande est excellente. L'une des meilleure que j'ai pu manger dans ma vie. Fondante, cuite comme je l'ai souhaitée. J'ai choisi également les frites (vendues séparément) et les poivrons frits. Tout était délicieux. Le service est impeccable et à l'écoute. Pourtant le restaurant était complet. L'endroit est chic et chaleureux. Le point faible reste le prix. Très élevé (100$ par personne pour plat, dessert) mais pour une grande occasion, c'est l'endroit idéal. J'y retournerais sans hésité!"}
{"text":"The space is beautiful and the menu covers the staples of a steakhouse. I was a bit disappointed with the food though - mainly because of high expectations coming in. My ribeye was nothing special. My friend's filet mignon was initially way overcooked - though they took it back and were apologetic about the original. The latkes were too oily for my taste - but ok. Their broccoli side was great. Their tartare was excellent: high quality meat, in nice sized cubes, flavour not overpowered by other stuff (though it had a particularly nice hint of pepper). Aged beef carpaccio was good but I didn't spot the difference between that and a normal good quality beef carpaccio. A bit expensive - even for a proper steakhouse.  Service was friendly - but a touch disorganized. Overall, it was solid.  [At some point, I want to try their evening discounted menu. Seems like a great deal.]"}
{"text":"A really wonderful experience. We were four New Yorkers with discerning taste buds and high expectations and this was wonderful from start to finish. The pickles are unreal and if you do nothing else, you must get the latkes! The filets were perfection. We were too full for dessert and that was my only regret."}
{"text":"This place is the quintessential Jewish steakhouse. Amazing service [waiters, busboys, waterboys, breadboys, front of staff, tableclothguys] etc.  The steak is one of the best I have had. So succulent and juicy. The bread at the begining comes with Pickles! [Also delicious]  This place is good, if you don't mind paying money for a steak [thanks dad for picking up the tab] and for seeing a very jewish crowd. It was great people watching. Generations of families from babies to grand grand parents. Celebrations, business meetings, anniversaries, it was all going down that night.  I highly recommend it, if you love steak, service, and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"They serve water right away but are not so good at refilling.  There is a parking lot for customers of the restaurant.  Even if we made a reservation we still had to wait 20 mins.  The air condition is a bit cold so bring a sweater.  They give you pickles and coleslaw on the table with bread.  The waiting list time to get your food is a bit long as well. Maybe cuz the restaurant is very popular.  I got the sirloin steak medium. It was very good! The rib steak also looks like a good option. The food here is exceptional.  It's pretty pricey and they even charge $7 for the peppercorn sauce.  This is a nice place to come for a special occasion."}
