{"text":"I have been going there for a couple of years, always great services and the food has never dissapointed.  The mushrooms are just too die for!"}
{"text":"First of all, I was very happy to finally have excellent service in a restaurant in Montreal. Food was served pretty fast, waiters were super nice and polite. 
The restaurant has cool interior design and a very nice atmosphere. Menus are well designed. I am Spanish and I was really surprised on how yummy and well cooked were all the tapas. We ordered the foie gras (excellent), garlic shrimps, sardine salad (amazing) and patatas bravas, which tasted really good. Cocktails are well done too. They just have 4 or 5 beers but huge wine selection. Price for 2 people was around 60$ with 2 drinks and 4 tapas (and it was way too much food). If you are not very hungry a tapa or 2 per person should be enough. 

I will definitely come back. Tapeo was a surprisingly amazing experience."}
{"text":"Really excellent staff and food.  We arrived on a very busy Saturday night and the host managed to find us a table. The staff was efficient and attentive, as each dish we tried was better than the last one.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had a birthday lunch - 4 of us, 2 guests a bit hesitant but in the end a totally fab meal. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Tapeo has been on my list since 2007.  Located in a quiet neighborhood, Tapeo Bar A Tapas is an amazing place for a date. (I've been on a few dates there.. Ahem...).  Sensual ambiance, tasty tapas, friendly service, quality crowd..  You feel at home 'with a twist'. And at a reasonable price!   Try the crispy calamari, the delicious chorizos, the 'Croquettes de morue' and don't forget the paella!"}
{"text":"Group of 6 girls.
Everybody who loves tapas loved it. The place was packed and loud. But it's worth it for the experience. It's a little harder to have your money worth if you are not a fan of tartare and the portions are really tiny. We were a group of girls but there's no way my boyfriend would have gone there and get his money worth... The place looks great, Loved the spanish food experience, very good food and good service. You definately need a reservation at all time, even for small groups. I loved that it was kind of easy to park in that area (or easier than the Plateau). It's definately a must try once.  

You have to remember:
Tiny, pricey, trendy and delicious."}
{"text":"Marie-fleur, le chef, est excellente ! Menu qui varie, plat succulents, ambiance excellente."}
{"text":"nous avons choisi Tapeo Sur le pif un samedi soir. sans reservation. nous avons été tres bien recu. La bouffe et le service est sublime Merci pour la belle soirée"}
{"text":"C'était excellent!!! La tartare de boeuf était très bon et différents. 5 à 6 tapas par couple et c'est parfait! Je pensais sortir du resto en ayant faim, mais au contraire nous avons mangée à notre faim!!! Les portions sont parfaites et aucun tapas ne se ressemble. Chaque plat a un goût différent... Bref j'ai adoré! Et les churros... Waw
P.S. Réserver toujours, très populaire comme place et le resto n'est pas très grand."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Food is extremely tasteful.  Service is excellent and staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience!!! I can't remember the last time I went to a restaurant, tried so many different dishes and loved all of them! 

Each tapa we tried was a new discovery of amazingly well put together flavours and fresh ingredients prepared with thought and expertise. 

The service was as incredible as the food. Congratulations to the owners and his team for an incredible dining establishment!"}
{"text":"We liked this so much that we returned for another dinner and it was as good as before.  We tried a few more dishes but we also had to go back to the dishes that made us fall in love.  Try the Iberian pork dish - sublime.  Fortunately the portion sizes allow us to try everything. Sadly the churros portion was not big enough for my wife and my two big boys. So we ordered 2 servings! We will be back the next we're in Montreal."}
{"text":"Déçue...! Trop bruyant, trop cher, tapas trop compliqués avec trop de peu de vraies saveurs espagnoles. Le service est moyen : les serveurs ne donnent pas de conseils, ils poussent à la consommation. La facture est bien trop élevée au final (ayant vécu de nombreuses années en Espagne, j'avais bcp d'espoirs, mais au final, c'est décevant...)"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! 
My family and I are visiting from NYC and decided to spend some time at Tapeo. It is the best decision we've made. 
From greeting to leaving. Top notch service - knowledgeable and personable waitstaff. 
Overall all superb time. 
Thank you thank you. 
Oh and the 90s hip hop (Jay-Z, Junior Mafia, and Snoop Dogg) much appreciated. Especially the hometown favorites."}
{"text":"Très déçu j'vais tant entendue parlé de ce restaurant que mes attentes étaient haute! Les plats étaient cher pour se que c'était j'aime beaucoup plus le pintxo."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday so we had the group menu. We tasted 11 things overall and everything was flavourful and different, I was super impressed! The patatas bravas were a huge hit. 

Service was professional, friendly and efficient.

The vibe is classy but not pretentious, fun for a date night or with friends!

Overall, one of the best meals I've had quality/price-wise in a long time."}
{"text":"Great Tapas. Average Paella. Lunch for two including tax and tip came to $91. Not a place to come for value for money."}
{"text":"I always try to put positive with reviews of places where I go. However.... 
If you go to TApeo,   you need a reservation. We waited 50 minutes to have our table on a Saturday night. Very unfortunate. They didn't even offer us a complementary drink. They just came to us a couple of times and kept on telling us to wait a couple of more minutes. It wasn't the case. Once we had the table, we were squeezed between two other tables. I understand that they want to fit people but sometimes it's too much. 
We asked one of the severs what were the beers choices, and she said she wasn't our server. she sent someone else. 
The food is good but be sure to make a night of it because food comes slowly. We had five dishes. We recommend the chorizo and patatas bravas. The paella is good for sharing. Drinks and wine are also good. Good selection. Bathrooms are mixed but relatively clean. Would I come back ? Maybe during the week on a calm night but definitely not on Friday or Saturday."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great tapas and sangria. Will be back for sure. Everything was delicious and well prepared."}
{"text":"Parfois il ne faut pas y aller par quatre chemins, mais simplement y aller pour manger ! :-D 

Qualité, saveurs, cadre agréable avec coin bar ou plutôt tables classiques, service agréable, bonne carte de vins.. tout a été dit sur cet excellent bar à tapas.. Nous reviendrons !

PS : ah oui j'allais oublier, réserve bien à l'avance ! (s'il te fallait encore une preuve de qualité...)"}
{"text":"Definitely in my personal top-5 in Montreal. Most tapas, if not all, are really great, service is professional and courteous and they have some very good and affordable wines.  Reservation is mandatory though, very popular venue lately."}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about Tapeo and have many times tried to get a reservation and found them to be booked solid. I finally got  lucky a few weeks ago and managed to get a reservation for last Friday. 

I must say that my expectations where high and the experience fell short. First the pluses. The service was terrific, the maitre d' charming and the decor and feel of the restaurant was great. Sadly it was some of the food that was disappointing. We ordered a pretty good number of items considering there was only two of us (see the list below) and many of the dishes were disappointing. Given the reputation and cost of the restaurant I found that the food was not nearly up to par. 

Here are a few of my issues. We ordered the tapas of the month which was a grilled bread dressed with tomatoes and sardines and spices for seasoning. Spaniards are famous for their  combos of toasted bread and fresh tomatoes so I was really looking forward to this and it was a big let down. The bread was a bit soggy and the tomates very sour, we didn't even finish the plate it was that distasteful. The sauteed mushrooms, a house specialty, also fell flat as they were strangely sweet and the Icelandic Cod fish & black rice was extremely salty. For dessert we had the Chocolat Churros, a real favorite of ours, which was also a disappointment. It tasted as it had been fired in oil that was due to be changed as the flavour and texture was less than ideal. 

Some of the dishes did hit the mark: the cod fritters were excellent and the salmon tarare was very good. However, overall I must say for an establishment that has such a good rep the cooking really fell flat last Friday.

Here's a list of everything we had:

- Salmon Tartare
- Cod fish fritters
- Sardines & whipped goat cheese
- Tapa of the month
- Sautéed mushrooms
- Icelandic Cod fish & black rice
- Jamón ibérico
- Chocolat Churros"}
{"text":"It's a good restaurant and you sure taste some new flavour if it's your first time there. I went there with co-workers and we had fun. The place is surely hip as the prices are a bit pricey for the portions you have especially the tapas.

To try a least once !

C'est un excellent restaurant and soyez certains que vous gouterez de nouvelles saveurs si c'est la première fois que vous y aller.

Je suis aller avec mes confrères de travail et nous avons eu du plaisir. 
C'est un restaurant dans le vent et le prix est un peu dispendieux pour les portions que vous obtenez surtout  les tapas.

À essayer !"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants!!  The tapas sizes are nicely sized to share for two.  The flavours of all the dishes are great.  I love the short rib and the sea bass is great.  Their selection of wines is very good.  Sitting at the bar is great too, the whole staff team is very professional and attentive"}
{"text":"Bar à tapas avec une belle ambiance moderne et à la fois sophistiquée mais aussi abordable. Nous n'avions pas réservé mais même la semaine il est conseillé de le faire. Nous avons cependant trouvé une place au bar et avons pu passer une excellente soirée. Nous avons choisi de partager des tapas, un assortiment de petits plats assez divers et très bien présentés. J'ai particulièrement aimé la salade de fenouil et aussi un plat de grosses crevettes marinées. Il y a des tapas vraiment très originaux mais toujours dans l'esprit espagnol. 
Le vin était également très bon et la serveuse avait de bonnes recommandations.
J'ai vraiment aimé ce lieu et j'y retournerai. Comptez tout de même au moins 50-70$ pour une personne si vous prenez plusieurs verres de vin."}
{"text":"I went to Tapeo last week with a friend. That place was pretty packed (middle of the week) and quite loud! That being said, the food was amazing and we both agreed that the special of the month (fries with truffles and lardon oil was amazing).

They are opening a second Spanish restaurant a couple of blocks west... Can't wait to try that one as well. 

I will definitely go back sometime!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favourite restaurants in the city! It is consistently delicious and always a wonderful experience! The staff are way on top of their game and the ambiance is so energetic. Tapeo encompasses everything I love about dining in Montreal!

Just a warning- I highly recommend reserving well in advance, especially for weekends. Also, be sure to order the mushrooms... if you don't like mushrooms this will convert you... if you do like mushrooms it will set an impossible standard for all shroom dishes that come after it. Apologies in advance."}
{"text":"Menu varié et en constante évolution. Choisissez vos plats ou laisser le serveur vous prendre en main. Surprises et délices au menu."}
{"text":"This place is beyond amazing.

Trendy, cool, and magnificently delicious! My friend and I ordered about 8 items off their menu, our favourites being their bacon wrapped scallops, meat balls, and garlic shrimp! But seriously, it was really hard to choose a favourite since everything was phenomenal.

Great tapas and wine list, great service, great ambiance. I will definitely be back to test out the rest of their menu-items.

(Co-ed bathrooms too! Ha!)"}
{"text":"Resto très sympa dans un cadre agréable. Nous avons laissé la serveuse choisir pour nous (il ne faut pas hésiter elle peut aussi choisir en fonction des goûts) et nous n'étions pas déçues! 
Prévoir 3 tapas par personne en moyenne. 
Prix élevés mais qualité au rendez-vous. Je recommande!"}
{"text":"Yum! Took a friend for a great birthday dinner here a few weeks back. What a great place! Loved the simplistic decor, the wait staff were attentive and very knowledgeable, and the food was spectacular. The sardine salad was refreshing, even though I am not a big fan of sardines. They were topped with oh so tummy deep fried oysters. The beef short rib was tender, falling off the bone goodness. Even something as simple as Serrano ham and cheese worked so well. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"omg hyper bien! et pas trop cher non plus! sauf peut-être le vin (qui était espagnol bien et délicieux) ... mais après avoir vécu à Paris, du vin partout ailleurs semble être une arnaque!

vraiment, nous avons mangé trop bien ici. le seul commentaire négatif que j'ai est qu'ils nous ont poussé un peu pour commander des tapas beaucoup quand nous aurions pu faire avec moins. mais c'est normal pour les restaurants comme celui-ci je crois.

je recommanderais la crevette, le pétoncle (un particulier), et la betterave. le rôti de boeuf était aussi très bon.
--------------------------------

omg sooooooo good ! and not too expensive either ! except for maybe the wine (which was spanish of course and delicious)... but after living in paris, wine anywhere else seems like a rip off ! 

really, we ate too well here. the only negative comment i have is that they pushed us a bit to order many tapas when we could have done with less. but that is normal for restaurants like this i believe.

i would recomend the shrimp, the scallop (a special), and the beetroot. the roast beef was also quite good."}
{"text":"Great tapas resto!   Wide selection of tapas ...churros are a must try ! Excellent service. Great for groups. Each tapas had it's own unique mouth watering taste .  Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Me and my gf spent two nights in Montreal and we'd heard great things about Tapeo. It seemed fully booked, but with a back-up up our sleeves (Dinette Triple Crown diner if you must know), we went to Tapeo. They managed to squeeze us in! Good for us! Great tapas (My favorite was the salmon tartar), nice service and an all-around cool place worth your time and money."}
{"text":"As someone who's half-Spanish, lived in Spain with a mom who cooked this type of cuisine on a regular basis most of my life let's just say my expectations were pretty high for a place with this type of hype.

First off, the place is very pretty! Ideal for a fancy meal or a special moment. It's a very busy setting with not a whole lot of room between you and other tables. To say they have optimized seating would be a fair statement. Atmosphere is great and for people who love trendy, this is the place to be. Looking for Romance, this isn't it! Looking for family setting, definitely not it! This is a place to be seen, a place to have an adventure!

We ordered the following plates and here are my impressions :

Charcuteria Plate : This plate consists of Iberian ham, chorizo, salami, olives, etc. It's a small tapas portion with EXACTLY 4 slice of everything. Priced at $22, I found the value in this plate low. I love these type of plates so I was looking forward to it... and.... and it was just fine, nothing really wowed me. Who would have known I needed more than 2 tiny slices of chorizo to have enough to have a tangible impression? (2/5)

Octopus & Sweet Potatoes : Very good, tapas style but good enough for 2 people. (4/5)

Patatas Bravas : Good but not that great, portion is somewhat small so sharing it for 2 was a stretch. It's potatoes people, give us more. (3/5)

Paella for 2 ($50) : Our main course. I won't lie, it's was pretty damned good and the quality of the sea food was top tier. Rice was cooked to perfection. Excellent dish but what's up with the $50 price-tag? Greedy!! (3/5)

Churros : To even consider the portion tapas style would be a joke. You get 2 tiny churros ($2 each) with a tiny bowl of chocolate to dip it in. Churros was crispy on the outside, inside was under-cooked. This was prepped sloppily. (1/5)

Service was very good, a little impersonal but did their job quite well. I'm always a little off when more than 2 waiters are passing by and attending my table. Not sure who to talk to and during this particular meal no less than 4 wait staff stopped by our table.

All in all, the food was well below my expectations and I'm still looking for an ideal Spanish resto in Montreal. Tapeo did not provide what I was looking for and with the price-tag being what it was, I felt it had low value."}
{"text":"Worth the cab ride to get away from the monotony of downtown students, skyscrapers,  tourists, and relentlessly traditional French restaurants, Tapeo has a great selection of tapas and wines (I didn't check the beer list, sorry, but they do have Spanish beer if that helps).  Plenty of tasty options for vegetarians as well as carnivores. The three of us had about ten dishes, and all were delicious; some traditional, some inventive (the two dishes of the day, carrots with breaded olive and lemon, and swordfish) were wonderful and perfectly prepared.  Great ambiance, if a bit crowded, good service, and the owner was nice enough to introduce himself.  Tapeo was one of the highlights of this trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Une des meilleurs resto a Montréal la nourriture est tout simplement incroyable le service des employer (s) est irréprochable  le serveur nous a même payer des trou normand entre notre repas ils connaissent leurs produit et leurs menu a tomber par terre  ils suggèrent vraiment des plats personnalisé pour n importe quel palet !!"}
{"text":"Very good Tapas restaurant, and a great variety. The restaurant is located in the middle of a residential area, nice and simple decor, the standard menu items are written on the wall. They always have a \" Tapas du jour\" and a \" Tapas du mois\" which is great if you come often. The spanish tortilla, the short rib and the patatas bravas are my favorite. The octopus salad and the salmon tartar are also very good choices... you will certainly find a variety to your taste !!!"}
{"text":"God! I love Spanish food and Tapeo delivered the goods.

It's a very nice looking restaurants with nice modern and elegant decor. 
The meal started with a swordfish ceviche with olive chutney that was to die for. I had to take the very fresh and crunchy bread to swoop every last drop of the dish as it was way too tasty.
I took the lamb Bavette for the main dish. Beside being very hard to cut (no steak knives) I devoured the whole thing like my life depended on it. It may not have been a very traditionnal dish but who cares, it tasted a lot and it tasted great.
My friend took the seafood paella. It was packed with so many things. more seafood than paella. There was even some Chorizo up in there. The rice was a little too moist but beautifully aromatized. It smelled amazing and the smell would fill the whole room up.

As if it wasn't nice enough, just when we were saying how full and satisfied we were, they put a big plate of decadent Churros with chocolate sauce. Last time I was In spain, I couldn't stop eating churros. Churros for life!"}
{"text":"We know Spanish food is good, but never expected it can be soooo good, until today we had the pleasure enjoyed Tapeo, which was recommended by our local friend Risa recently in one of their organized bar-gathering. We were there today with another couple, and we were all really surprised by the fact that every thing we ordered were excellent.  We have to highlight few of them which are fresh, delicious in super high quality: its color, smell and taste......all impressive, the homemade Spanish sausage served with cherry tomato, the Salad in a white bowl with fresh graps and walnuts, the bacon wrapped scollaps in good size, the meat balls in attractive spice, the unbelievable tendered and juicy veal flanks and chicken, and the Paella our always love d dish .....can't list them all. On top of all these, we appreciate very much the good service provided here, very detailed introduction and explanation, and good recommendations. Wine is a super match with the food. 5-star always"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere.  All tapas we tried were amazing (olives, spanish tortilla, cod fish fritters, fideos,serrano and cheese).  Churros were a hit.  Paella was mediocre."}
{"text":"Went there for a friend's birthday. We were 3 and shared a big table with other people which we didn't mind because the table was spacious enough.

We ordered 9 plated with 2 bottles of wine. Although the plates were small,  we barely managed to finish all 9 tapas. 

I have read really good reviews before going there...maybe I'm not a fan of Spanish cuisine. Food was decent but not wow although the place is very nice."}
{"text":"Simply some of the best food I've ever had. The beef tartare is worth the flight from L.A. to Montreal. Bring a beautiful date with you and a pocket full of cash and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Very good Tapas, great wine and atmosphere . We were a group of 7 and tried many items such as cod with black rice, the octopus , Romesco Chicken , olives, green beans, chicken liver mousse , chorizo , marinated sword fish , garlic shrimps , salmon tartar etc. Everything was delicious including the thin potato chips offering on the table. The stars were the black cod, the garlic shrimp and the chicken which was a delightful surprise ( chicken is always tricky as it can be boring but this was beautifully grilled and in a tasty sauce ). The wines we chose were reasonably priced and  excellent. As for the deserts , the creme brule was def. one of the best we each had ever tasted and the basque almond cake was really good too. We also truly enjoyed the fact that despite a nice happy vibe the restaurant did not have noise pollution and we actually could hear our conversations. We will all be back to this great find."}
{"text":"Tout simplement un incontournable du quartier Villeray! 

Cuisine savoureuse et plats authentiques.

Grand frère du restaurant Mesón, on y voit bien les similitudes. 

Recommandé!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE!!!!!!!!!
I went here for a birthday and wasn't expecting anything fantastic considering it was a fixed menu for a large group. Wow was I ever proven wrong. 
The salmon tartare was DELISH, drinks were on point, calamari was super fresh and crunchy... we had plate after plate after plate after plate being served to us. I can't even remember half of what I had but you MUST try this place."}
{"text":"Loved their tasting menu!! For 40$ per person we could not eat the third service ... That's how much we were full.

I booked it 3 wks in advance because we were a group of 15. 

Service was awesome, the staff was friendly.
Sometimes the food was a tiny bit too salty but still deserves a 5 :)"}
{"text":"One of the best Tapas places in the city. Excellent service, diverse dishes and great atmosphere. We once showed up 30 months before closing and we were welcomed. Not rushed and enjoyed every minute of our dinner past closing."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! What a neighborhood gem.  And owner Victor and bartender Gabby treated us like we were family over their house.  The food was spectacular;  every single dish!  The Albacore a tuna is worth driving back from RI alone, but the short rib and Icelandic cod were best food we had all weekend!  Foodies paradise!"}
{"text":"Belle expérience, bonne bouffe, merci à Gabrielle, mais service un peu rapide. Retour de notre nourriture sous les réchauds et rappinis trop amers."}
{"text":"Tapeo is a GEM. A little off the beaten path but well worth the trip. I've been here twice and it has been consistently good. A modern, crisp ambiance, descent service, but most importantly: the food!

The menu is written in chalk on a large wall in the restaurant. Usual Tapas fare, but extremely well executed. A caprese salad is made special with tomatoes roasted on the vine, and this unctuosly creamy mozarella. Oven roasted potatoes that explode with flavor. A chicken breast, usually so dry and flavorless!, which, served with a rich lemon cream sauce is possibly the best chicken breast I have ever had.

Its one of those places that you can taste the effort and detail that went into each dish. I ate for two (no alcohol, no desert) for 80$."}
{"text":"Good spot for Tapas. 
The location is a bit off for people living near downtown and commuting without a car. 
Overall, a good experience in terms of service and wine selection."}
{"text":"I have been going to Tapeo for years and I am surprised that I never reviewed them! How is that possible!!!? 

Anyhow, when they were the first real gourmet tapas in Montreal, it was hands down the best. The dishes were original and so flavourful.

The dishes are still flavourful but that originality has been replaced by \"safer\" choices. I remember the veal with cherry sauce.... mmmm. Those days are sadly over.

The only dishes I am not crazy about are the fideos and the bravas... They lack a certain much needed brightness... then again, that might just be personal choice. Every other dish is solid.

The service is always great. The 2 owners are always there making sure all is under control."}
{"text":"hands down, the best tapas experience I've had in a while. i went for a lovely dinner with my boyfriend last night, and at the recommendation of friends and other reviewers, let our waiter choose our dishes.

highlights: scallops wrapped in lardon...i have very few words left in my vocabulary that will do this dish justice. by far my favorite selection, the melt in your mouth scallops were very large and cooked perfectly tender and sweet, lardon was crisp and not too fatty and the reduction was a wonderfully redolent  compliment to the dish and great for saucing bread

fried callamari - lightly battered with a hint of heat from the black pepper and a beautiful garlic aioli as dipping sauce. 

tomates sur vigne with fromage de chevre -  cherry tomatoes cooked straight on the vine to perfection were a perfect reminder of late summer with the complimentary tang of the soft, warmed goat cheese. 

other selections which were highly enjoyable include the delicious complimentary salmon tartar served on a fresh slice of cucumber which was brought to us before our meal, the beautifully braised leek with tomates confit...i really had no idea leek could be so sweet and delicious...

at the end of our meal, we were a little stuffed and debating on dessert. before we could decide for ourselves, we were brought a lovely plate of churros on the house. had we not eaten quite so much, we would have inhaled the dense doughy delights and probably licked the bowl of chocolate sauce...as it was, full, we still managed to gorge on half the plate.

6 tapas and a low end bottle of wine: 100 dollars + a really good tip.

there is no doubt that we will be back again. make reservations well in advance if you are going on the weekend, kitchen closes at 11. allow at least 2 hours for a full and exceptional experience."}
{"text":"This was my first time and will probably be my last.  I had heard so much about this restaurant and was really looking forward to my first experience with a group of friends. The service was good but the food was just so-so.  Certainly not worth the $135 tab for two (no alcohol).  No one left satisfied and we all agreed that the food was mediocre and definitely not enough to satisfy our bellies and justify the price tag."}
{"text":"1er impression en rentrant déco soigné, présentation des tapas sur un grand mur en ardoise, un grand comptoir et 15-20 tables, qui étaient toutes rempli à 20h un mercredi. Le serveur nous conseille entré 10 et 12 tapas pour 5. Nous en avons donc commandé 12 + les desserts.  Les froids : mini-burger de crevette, pieuvre, salade composé, salade de sardines et tartare de saumon. Toute était très bon et bien assaisonnez, le tout est suffisamment copieux si on prend 3 tapas par personne. Même constation pour les plats chaud très goûteux et parfaitement assaisonnés, boulette de viande, pétoncle, moules et calamar. Pour finir les desserts, crème catalane, churros et chocolat nougat, dans l'ensemble très bon mais j'ai trouvé la crème   catalane un peu trop sucré. Donc pour nous très bonne soirée, avec un rapport qualité prix correcte, compté 45$/pers (3 tapas + 1 boisson)."}
{"text":"OMG this restaurant was AMAZING! Went with someone with celiac and had NO ISSUES with any gluten or cross contamination, waitstaff was super responsive and very knowledgeable, and  recommended some amazing dishes to us. Had a GREAT dinner and so much fun - definitely will return."}
