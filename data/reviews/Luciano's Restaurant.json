{"text":"This place is horrendous. The food is inedible. Rock hard risotto and rubbery, slimy angel hair. The sauces had no body and lacked flavor. There is not another soul in this place. I will never return."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to some high end Italian food having just moved to the neighborhood. Based on great rating an reviews this place looked like a winner. 

We called for an early reservation and arrived with wife and two kids. The place was deserted but it was early. 

A woman came out and upon seeing two children proceeded to treat us like we had the plague. She kept saying \"you know we don't have pizza?\" And rather than seating us she brought us menus and asked us to look at them bc we had kids. Yeah, I know this isn't Chuck E Cheese. 

I was shocked at the rudeness. I've been to Italian places all over the world and they are always warm and inviting an focused on family. If its Saturday night and 8pm I get it...don't bring kids. 5:30 on a Thursday with an empty restaurant?

It's a real shame this kind of pretentious snobbery exists especially for a restaurant with an empty parking lot all night. I know it was empty bc we went next door where my daughter had linguine alla vongole...and was MAD she couldn't have escargot, her favorite dish."}
{"text":"Delicious and unique experience.  When we arrived, we were initially skeptical, used to places that have hyped up their fare to draw the crowds.  Luciano's doesn't rely on hype, it relies on excellent food and word of mouth.  The chef, native to Italy, returns every year to bring back fresh ingredients such as olive oil that adds that extra touch of flavor to the dish.  He then comes to your table, not only to check to ensure that your food is as it should be, but also to make the best Caesar Salad and dressing from scratch that you'll ever have.  The wine list doesn't fail, and you may want to ask to be seated in a corner, the better to hide from view when you can't help but practically lick your plate!"}
{"text":"To give you an idea as to how great this place is, the owner and sole chef, Luciano has been a fixture on the Cleveland food scene for the past 30 years.  This is the same man who trained numerous local area chefs who later opened up successful restaurants, such as Giovannis, using the skill and flare taught to them via Luciano.  Luciano received his culinary skills training in Milan prior to coming to the U.S where he quickly caught on and made a name for himself. As a standard, everything he serves is made fresh, from the bread, to the pasta, and the olive oil is specially imported from his home region of Italy. He offers a broad selection of wines, and makes decadent desserts as well. Moreover, he is open to all tastes and loves to accomadate special meal requests or items not listed on the menu, (alla vodka, gnocchi) The interior of the restaurant is elegant and classic.  There is also a full bar  that serves expresso as well. Furthermore, Luciano only invests in top quality products for his customers as he believes that they deserve the best  If you truly want to experience authentic, unadulterated, top quality Italian cusine from a true master of culinary art who inspired numnerous successful local area chefs, then I implore you to try thid fine establishment!"}
