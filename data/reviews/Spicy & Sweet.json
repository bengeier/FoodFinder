{"text":"Extremely disappointed. How can a place like this even survive on St Clair? I ordered on Just Eat and not only did it take FOREVER to arrive, it was super cold. My God, dare I say this the place is expensive and the portions are super SMALL. UGH! What a waste of my money. Never again."}
{"text":"Was craving spicy food, so ordered up the Chili Chicken and some spicy Szechuan Beef. It was nicely spicy, but there really wasn't anything special about the food. The chicken didn't taste any different than the beef, despite it supposedly being two separate dishes.   I also had the Mango Sticky Rice for dessert, which I figured would be hard to mess up. But the mango wasn't ripe so was pretty sour, and the rice was mostly flavorless.  Overall I was pretty disappointed. If you want run of the mill Westernized Chinese fast-food fare, then you'll be fine. But for those looking for something slightly more - you may wish to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We placed an order for delivery and told that they would arrive within 50 minutes. After an hour we called and were told the food was on its way. We called again and told the same story. Then an hour after they said the food would arrive it finally came. I would never order delivery from this place again as their customer service is really bad."}
{"text":"You came here to see if it's worth going. One thing you need to know: it's delicious.  It's a little on the expensive side but that's what you get for ordering from an independently owned restaurant. I order from there at least once a week. Lovely service, friendly owners.   It's definitely worth going."}
{"text":"This place was downright gross.  Ended up being $10 for lunch and it was flavourless and unsatisfying.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Some of the crispiest chow mein I've tasted... they must add the sauce seconds before bringing out the dish.  I ask for it with 'everything' (chicken, shrimp, pork and beef) only +$1.     Beware about ordering green tea... it costs quite a bit extra.  Most places throw that in for free.    It's run by a husband and wife team whose english is a little limited.  This can lead to confusion in ordering dishes.  It's best to write your own orders down and use the numbers."}
{"text":"Was completely empty when I entered. I ordered Chinese beer which was great!  Then ordered the Thai spicy noodle with chicken, it came out rather quick and was average at best. Over cooked noodles and chicken with rather bland and scarce vegetables. Not horrible, but not great."}
{"text":"Ordered a vegetarian dish for takeout. Got home and it was full of chicken so I couldn't eat it. Never going back there."}
{"text":"Relative newcomer Spicy & Sweet is in a storefront that's hosted a series of tiny, cursed mom & pop restaurants.  Before this it was the Jamaican place with the lovely service and grade D breakfasts.  Before that, it was a Cuban joint so authentic the meat wasn't seasoned.  Can Spicy & Sweet break the curse?  Maybe.  Service is helpful and friendly, and prices are low.  Domestic beer is less than $4 a bottle, and their couple of imports are barely over that.  The Chinese Wok selections are pretty good.  We both really liked the Gong Po Chicken, which was deep-fried & served in a Szechuwan sauce with fresh, still-crunchy vegetables.  My husband loved the Tender Chicken for its' simplicity, but I found it a bit bland.    We didn't order from the Thai part of the menu because my husband had found the Pad Thai bland on his previous visit - my understanding is that the family is Chinese, and is still perfecting their Thai.  Still, I'm not going to write it off yet - if I can learn to make a fairly authentic Pad Thai, so can they.    They haven't had a ton of money to invest in the place, but they've done surprisingly well with a new coat of colourful paint and some recessed lighting.  This should be a 3-star review, but something about the visit (and the cheap beer) won me over.  I think we'll visit again, or take advantage of their delivery service."}
{"text":"After wanting to try some Peruvian chow along the St. Clair west strip, we shortly realized that the Civic holiday Monday had rendered most of the Restos closed...come on, what in gods name are people like us supposed to do on nights like tonight, stay home and cook? Pshhh no.  We were turned away by Khmer Thai at 9pm...seriously? There were like 8 people still eating inside and they were still doing take out! Rude.  Anyways, this particular family run dive was one of the only things open so we trusted the good Yelp rating and walked in. We soon noticed the little sign on the table offering overpriced dim sum (lol no thanks) and what seemed to be a very reasonable drink menu. $5/ beer bottle and just $1.10 for a can of pop.  The menu itself was Ok and offered up the usual apps, soups and mango salad items. The mains consisted of some noodles and pad Thai, some curry options, and a bunch of Chinese fare from crispy beef, through chicken and broccoli, to seafood and veggie dishes....and authenticity flies out the window with each item listed. Everythin priced around the $10 mark btw.  Our drinks came out (room temp tap water and a can of pop). No glass with ice to pour the pop into....ok fine. The 3 dishes we ordered were satay chicken with veg, szechuan spicy beef, and ginger fish. $1.50 for a bowl of steamed rice.  They were all basically the same dishes in that the only remarkable difference between the plates were the meats on top. Everything tasted ok but it was clearly the offerings of cheap and amateur Chinese cooking. If this place was dirt cheap I might have given it an extra star, but I stand firm in saying I was not impressed with the food or service. We were the ONLY diners in the place, the last ones, and after clearing every morsel of food from the plates it was clear that we probably could have used something else, but was anything offered? Nope, no orange slices no fortune cookies nata.   If everything on the strip is closed I guess you could stop in for food poison free food, but otherwise save yourself the trouble."}
{"text":"Well, the name's half-right. I've ordered from Spicy and Sweet a few times and suggest they rename it Sweet and SWEET {emphasis mine}.  Hot and Sour, Szechuan, General Tso, moo shoo, Soo Gai, Beef with Broccoli, all drenched in the same molasses-thick, corn-syrup sweet goo. The menu supposedly crosses different Asian cuisines, but I quit before my blood sugar rose to threat-level. Also, and this is a deal-breaker unless I'm driven to Kosher Chinese (which never, ever happens, since God could not have known about the wonders of Char Siu when he handed Moses the tablets), no fracking pork? What? Pork is the reason you order Chinese instead of cooking! Sheesh!!! Te]wo stars, because i fear that last comment may have offended someone."}
