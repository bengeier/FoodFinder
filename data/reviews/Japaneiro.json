{"text":"Enjoyable happy hour menu - it was a great way to try everything! We will be back again, and are getting the truffle edamame and black cod lettuce wrap again for sure :) ...so I made the cardinal mistake of posting before I finished my meal with dessert - the green tea tiramisu was amazing!  I'm a big fan of the milk tea ice cream too. Also, I was really impressed by how knowledgable our server was about the menu. She described everything perfectly. And you always have to appreciate it when the chef takes the time to come out of the kitchen to touch (greet) every table!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE ROCKS!  Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING that I have had has been TOP SHELF.  The rock shrimp appetizer, truffle edamame, and salmon taco are MUSTS.  The bento boxes are also a great deal, with certified beef, salad, tempura, and a steamed egg for $11!  The chef is extremely accommodating, accepting subs for Miso soup instead of salad.  Again, I highly recommend this place and will be going back many many more times!!"}
{"text":"First time here and got take out last night. Good flavors for the most part and the miso soup was good. Had the fried rock shrimp, tuna tacos, black cod lettuce cups , angus beef gyoza and steamed rice.  My really only complaint is the size of the black cod portions in the lettuce cups. I understand what it takes to cost food out and make a profit but these cod pieces were literally .5 oz or less. Almost couldn't see it , the pieces were so tiny. For 6 bucks , I thought I would get more fish. All in all not bad but not a place I'm dying to go back to."}
{"text":"the Bone Marrow was as big as my legs and after me and my friends got done cleaning it out, we bought baseballs and started playing home run derby in the parking lot. It was that big, but so damn good.  I forgot the chef's name but he was introducing and explaining every dish that we ordered.   -Bone Marrow with truffle butter (no drake) -Prime NY topped with foie gras -Foie gras topped with uni -Beef kushi -Seabass lettuce wraps   about 6 or 7 more dishes, I was put in a food coma after the first 18 minutes and made me forget everything else we ordered. Everything was amazing. 5 stars, plus Asahi. Yum.. Cheers"}
{"text":"Friends took us here and it was AMAZING. I love high end high quality beef and the A5 grade wagyu beef was heavenly. We paired the bone marrow and prime rib together and their ponzu sauce shines... soooo good. Nigerian prawns were longer than the forks! Truffle edamame is a great starter. Also had the tuna tacos, beef tacos, and shrimp appetizer. Everything we had was super tasty/flavorful and the service was top notch and so friendly! I'd recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and ordered everything. I didn't care for the dishes, but some other people at the table did. Would help if they sold beer or wine or sake. I'd definitely go again and try some of their specials which sounds fantastic."}
{"text":"Quality and presentation of the food can match Nobu & Morimoto but the price is half of that or less. The oyster with uni and foie gra was as good as the one I had at Morimoto a few nights ago. The marrow beef was heavenly and their home made ice cream was a  perfect end to the awesome 7-course chef's dinner!! Will definitely be back the next time I am in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Things to try: Gyoya with Angus Beef, escargot for sure, prawn dish (the best), salmon. It's a diamond in a rough, the quality competes with strip restaurant. Japanese and French fusion...I'll keep coming back for sure. Bookmark it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled across Japaneiro when looking for something quick in the area that was still open at 11:30 pm when we got back into town.  The reviews looked good and we decided to give it a try and WOW!!!!!  I can't remember the last time I had a meal that amazing.  Every single thing not only had a beautiful presentation, but tasted fantastic.  They have a reverse happy hour so everything was priced very well.  I recommend the rock shrimp, beef kushi, shrimp kushi and the tuna tacos.  They also have a very good beer and wine selection.  Kevin was fantastic and made the experience really great.  We will definitely be going back often."}
{"text":"The food is incredible!!  Everything we tried from the appetizers to the entr√©es and the desserts were delicious.  Very nice ambiance. Lolo was an amazing server really sweet and very knowledgable about the menu. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, high quality fusion Japanese menu, local price, newly nice place to hangout!!!"}
{"text":"Finally got to take my mom here tonight & she loved it! They have a board of all their specials for the day. We tried their salmon belly ceviche, salmon w/ Uni, octopus, foie gras w/ scallop, soft shell crab, premium seaweed salad, and their steak. We enjoyed all the dishes! The sauces & flavors were on point. Their prices are reasonable for the quality your getting. We will def be back to try their lobster w/ Uni butter & escargot. They also have Happy Hr 4-6 & 10-2am Thank you to our waitress Sara for being so attentive & sweet! & giving us great recommendations."}
{"text":"Love everything we ordered tonight, good food with awesome service, will be back soon"}
{"text":"Friendly service, relaxing atmosphere, and delicious food. The rockin shrimp is a must!"}
{"text":"Ventured away from the strip and was not disappointed. About a 12-15 min drive but was totally worth it. We got the foie gras, ceviche, black cod, and salmon.   Location yet got their liquor license so we got our fill of food vs. liquor. Small location and it's a hidden gem and residential neighborhood."}
{"text":"--- THEY ARE OVER PRICED & OVER RATED! --- move on to a different restaurant down the street with better ambience and better food price and quality! Three stars coz the items that we ordered were good (bone marrow, tacos, yakisoba, soup), the service was excellent but i don't think i'll ever go back -- the servings were not worth the price! we had to stop ordering coz we figured that our bill is just gonna get higher and we're just not gonna feel like we've eaten anything! we ended up going to another restaurant right after."}
{"text":"Amazing! The NY strip topped with Foie Gras is awesome. The chef comes out to talk to you about the dishes and his creations are gorgeous. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner last night and was sure what to expect. We ordered a couple items (salmon-tuna tacos etc..) and after that just had the Chefs make us different plates!! And wow they did a great job in coming up with things that wasn't even on the menu. Had so many great dishes that I couldn't really tell what they were but had a great dinner. A bit far for me but would definitely be back to try other dishes when I'm in the area. For all you that haven't been there check out the place and support this local Gem!!!"}
{"text":"walked in the door, smelled the most rancid chemical smell. decided to leave and try again another day. what the heck was that smell? it was completely overpowering..."}
{"text":"This was from several months ago.  I was delighted when a friend alerted me to a recent ELV post about Japaneiro. Mr. Curtas said it had one of the best steaks in the valley. So off I went with a couple friends to sample some delightfully balanced and wonderfully flavored food presented by a proud and friendly staff. The first impression when you drive to this location (7315 West Warm Springs Road, exactly a 15 min, easy drive from my hotel) is that it better have good food to bring people in. The specials board is front and center when you walk to the smallish but well layer out dining room.  I made what I though was a huge mistake by leaving my glasses back at the hotel so I was blind trying to read the menu, which may have turned out to be a blessing! But after reading the specials board (Fresh Japanese abalone, prime dry aged rib eye, uni here and uni there, Nigerian giant prawn, and so on...) I knew the menu would have to be explored another time.  I will not go into each individual bite and dish as my time is limited this morning (trying to qualify for WSOP) but will say that the flavors that chef and owner Kevin Chong (what a nice and proud gentleman) coaxes out of his dishes along with the laser like focus and layering is at times mesmerizing (salmon belly cevich?, uni bites, Foie/scallop bite...). Does everything work with absolute precision? In my opinion no. Pretty damn close though! I found the bone marrow and the bone marrow filet to be a bit clunky (although the filet was cooked PERFECTLY and of top quality) and the duck and Foie too rich (to be fair about that dish though, it was ordered late and was the final of something like 12 full sized dishes so maybe try it again).  Finally, to address Mr. Curtas' claim about one of the best steaks in the valley...it could be (we did not sample the tomahawk chop and I am referring to the dry aged ribeye only). The steak was perfectly cooked, sliced and presented on a wooden board adorned with 6-8 different types of salt and two dipping sauces. My preference and what I would suggest is to skip the sauces. Again, they were not bad (actually very tasty) but I felt it detracted from the quality of the beef. Also one word of warning about this steak. Ribeyes are inherently fatty and when the steak is presliced before it comes to the table many pieces of the glorious meat still have some fat attached. Personally it doesn't bother me and if proportioned right will enhance the experience.  Price-wise, I think one can dine for a very reasonable tab (at the moment they are BYOB so that keeps tabs reasonable). Our bill for 3 was close to $200 each. BUT, and that is a BIG BUT, we had about 12 dishes, 2 of which were the $90 a piece abalone.  Kevin, server Jeffery and the rest of the staff (please forgive me forgetting the name of the wonderful sous chef!) have much to be proud of. This is a place that should be on everybody's radar."}
{"text":"Tried five different dishes from the menu and very satisfied with them and the service. Defiantly coming back to try the rest."}
{"text":"Stopped by tonight with my daughter to sample some dishes on Happy Hour.  The rock shrimp was super yummy, portion size was a great deal for the happy hour price.  We also tried the truffle oil edamame, it was ok.  I have to say I really like traditional or a hot and spicy taste better than than the truffle oil.  We tried one each of the skewers.  The chicken was not that flavorful, but the steak was much better.  For the cost it's a bit on the expensive side, but since it's a good cut of meat I don't mind the extra expense.  The gyoza beef was very tasty.  Lastly we had an order of the house special fried rice.  Portion size was surprising for cost.  It's definitely shareable with lots of meat.    Overall good experience waitress was very good, water glasses were consistently refreshed and she was friendly but not over friendly.....where you can't eat."}
{"text":"This place was awesome--great food and service, no crowd.  The Irish Salmon is to die for!"}
{"text":"Somebody please enlighten me about what I'm missing!  Live close to here so noticed it when it first opened. Didn't go right away, but kept seeing awesome reviews so we decided to try it out.   We arrived about 10 minutes after they opened for lunch on a Saturday, already 3 tables seated so we thought to ourselves, this is going to be awesome!    First of all, the club music was so loud, I couldn't hear the hubs sitting across from me. Easy fix, asked the server to turn the music down. Much better.   We ordered: -Edamame - this was delicious, fresh edamame with nice truffle flavor. Not worth the price though... -Firecracker shrimp - this was pretty good, but I'd rather spend $6 at bonefish grill's bang bang Wednesdays and get a heaping mound of it. Wasn't \"wow\" -Lotus chip tuna - similar to the tostadas at Soho. I really liked the lotus chip, but felt the tuna was lacking (both in portion and in taste/freshness) -All 3 tacos - this is when things started to go south. The first one I tried was the tuna, and the only thing I could think of was \"wow, this tastes like that powdery Mexican spice you get from a packet with some mush in the middle\" The Mexican spice was so overwhelming that I couldn't taste the tuna at all. The second one was the beef and I thought \"hmmm, Mexican spice taco shell with Korean bugolgi\". The salmon was the best (nice freshness of fish/avo/sauce), although still too much Mexican spice on the taco. -Bone marrow - I think these came from a starving cow. Very little marrow, too much crap on top, and greasy tortilla chips on the side. Why would you need salts/spices on the plate if the marrow itself is already seasoned? (if you want to try an amazing bone marrow for less the price and more portion-wise, try Gordon Ramsay Steak at the Paris) -Scallop - too much sauce, couldn't get the scallop. Scallop wasn't quite seared enough on the outside so tasted too mushy. -Foie gras - ehhh, have had better. Sauce tasted burnt. -Banana dessert - pretty good, nice caramelization on the outside. -Green tea creme brulee - you know those crunchy strips of noodles you get at a Chinese buffet to dip in the bright red sweet/sour sauce? The cr√®me brulee was topped with something that reminded me a lot of that (besides, if there is good caramelization on the brulee, why would you need noodle strips?)  It also tasted way tooo burnt, like I was spooning burnt custard in my mouth.   I think we got something else, but neither one of us can remember what it was...  I guess it just wasn't memorable enough.  On the plus side, service was awesome and the plating is beautiful. Prices are a little steep for what the food is. Don't get me wrong, we don't mind paying for good food. But this just wasn't it. They also need to figure out that a Mexican spiced taco shell plus some salmon poke does not fusion make.   I really like to see little businesses succeed and I hope they do, but unfortunately, I cannot recommend this place to anyone nor will we be back."}
{"text":"Just had an awesome dining experience at the place. Great food and customer service! Recommend the house salad, rock shrimp, Chilean sea bass and sample platter made to order. Chef was very accommodating and even came to our table to check on us. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been to this place 5 or 6 times now since they have opened and I am a huge fan. The food is amazing, fresh, tasty, and unique. Their happy hour is a steal for the amount of food you get. All of the tacos are great as well as the jidori chicken kushi. The service is always prompt and attentive. The entire staff including the chef are really friendly and enjoy talking with guests about their dishes."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the way and was pleasantly surprised. Service was great had the seafood udon , baby octopus, tuna lotus chips and chicken yakisoba all yum! Chef came out to greet us thought that was nice."}
{"text":"one of the best new places to check out. Will definitely be back!!!!  Everything we ordered on the menu was really good and fine dining quality!!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend for dinner. It wasn't busy which was nice. Our server was really attentive and staff was very friendly.   Rock fish was amazing! Also got the salmon tacos and seaweed salad. All delicious! Will be back!"}
{"text":"The second we walked in we were cheerfully greeted by our server and sat.  We ate the Ahi Taco, Yakisoba special, Fried Rice special, Lotus chips and the Rock Shrimp (which was our favorite!)  Our server was awesome and 100% attentive.  We also had an oppurtunity to meet Kevin who made sure that we were taken cared of.     We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to love this place as it is close to my house. But it was really disappointing!   We ordered their rock shrimp, salmon and tuna chips, ny strip steak, and a few other items.  Main entrees were not brought out together.  There was 3-4 minutes between the the three items.  Very disappointing.  Will not go their again."}
{"text":"Phenomenal happy hour appetizers. Tried the rock shrimp, nice spicy mayo seasoning garnished with sliced red cabbage and light greens. Gyoza and the chicken kushi had great seasoning and flavor. The quality of the gyozas were amazing. No mystery meat pieces like you'll find in most Asian restaurants.  The small bite sized tacos were surprisingly delightful with it's aioli wasabi sauce.  I'm looking forward to coming back and trying some of the entr√©es in the near future!"}
{"text":"Place is amazing.  Just read the other reviews if you want but do yourself a favor and go here.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A beautiful example of high quality food very well executed.  Well worth the drive to leave the strip and enjoy a higher quality experience without the insulting prices.  As others have mentioned, the black cod is buttery smooth and perfectly cooked. All the flavors are on point.  I recommend the truffle oil edamame and the scallops -- enjoy the scallops, then mix the rice in the remaining sauce and drizzle the extra truffle oil from the edamame appetizer over the top.  The flavors are well balanced and a hint of spice is used to excellent effect."}
{"text":"I came here the other night for my friend's birthday. It was an interesting place to try. It is a type of Japanese fusion. It is a bit pricier, but that's what you expect with smaller Japanese tapas places.  I ordered the salmon tacos ($4) and the chicken yakisoba ($7). The salmon tacos came in 2. I had hoped hoped for a more poki style taste, but it was just mostly a salmon taste. the sides were crispy. They did have a yakiudon option, but I thought it was the soup option. Boy, was I wrong. I wish I had ordered the yakiudon because I prefer the fat noodles. It was pretty ordinary as in taste wise.   The stuff feels pretty average, and a little pricey. I had eaten beforehand   The servers were really nice and did check up on us. I just felt the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"This cool, cozy new restaurant is insanely amazing! DEALicious meal (good quality food at reasonable price). Some of its tastiest dishes are truffle edamame, miso seabass, rock shrimp, black cod.....oh even TACO ! We tried tuna, salmon, beef and crab taco. Especially crab taco offer a dazzling mouthful the likes of which we're never tasted.....trust me; order of 4 tacos will not be enough....not to mention SCALLOPS import from Hokkaido Japan! in addition to being fresh and flavorful, they are HUGE. The food is artfully prepared and delicious. The chefs are so talented and staff are so friendly . 5 stars restaurant's quality for 3 stars restaurant's price! Definitely, this place is on the top of our list! Two thumbs up :-)"}
{"text":"WOW!!! don't miss out on this place...  Asian fusion at it's BEST. This restaurant is a real hidden gem!  I love to come and find out what weekly specials they have written on the famous wall. I appreciate the AAA top quality ingredients and the service is professional and friendly. Some of my favorite dishes are the Rock Shrimp, Beef Tobanyaki, Truffle oil Edamame, and Chillean Seabass. They have a happy hour too!! :) but  liquor coming soon"}
{"text":"Rock shrimp is where it's at!! Chef knows what's up ! Great spot, awesome food! Server was incredible about describing the menu. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've never left a restaurant review where I had the opportunity to eat so many different items in one sitting (I ate ten!)  Japaneiro was amazing!  I wasn't sure what Japanese fusion was until today and now I hope that it makes its way to my hometown soon.   As I mentioned (and not necessarily proud to publicize), I ate a bunch. My personal recommendations are the Gyoza, the Black Cod Lettuce Wraps, the Beef Tacos, the Salmon Ceviche and the Rock Shrimp.   I look forward to coming back to Vegas for each and every one of these!"}
{"text":"Food was AMAZING. Our server Kevin was the shit. If you live in the southwest area come here asap."}
{"text":"The food is simply amazing. A new spot that should not be missed by anyone who appreciates good food. I signed up on yelp just to be able to review them."}
{"text":"I have been to Japaneiro a couple of times now. I love it! The Happy Hour Menu is perfect to sample from and really builds the excitement when ordering an entree. You can tell the chef takes pride in his food, such creativity. Did I mention it's BYOB?! #Localsheaven. Positive vibes every time and growing, plan to make it my summer retreat."}
{"text":"Wow! What an original.  I've never had the combinations of flavors I've experienced here. Great service and fine dining atmosphere without the pretentious vibes. The food and menu though is truly one of a kind and more thought out than anything triple the price on the strip. They treat locals right and offer something truly unique in a town full of the best food in the world.... I would put them up against anything I've had in town easily. Imagine your own neighborhood Nobu but waaaay better and half price. They truly appreciate their customers and you can tell they enjoy blowing people's minds with the flavors in the food they produce. True passion that shines through in everything about the establishment."}
{"text":"This place is amazing - but in a bad location.  All the other businesses have closed in the complex.  Hopefully things will change for the good.  We came here last minute for Valentines Day.  After eating here, I'm surprised we were able to get a table.  My gain :)  It was an expected preset menu 7 course meal for $150 for two people - see pic.  Unbelievably reasonable.  We started off with the Teramoto Scallop with uni - with a refreshing yuzu soy.  Fresh and delicious.  Second was scottish salmon cerviche - this was just ok compared to the rest of the meal.  Next was kumamoto oysters - love the taste of the ocean.  Then escargot - not chewy and loved the butter sauce.  The next two is the MAIN reason why anyone should come here!  Nigerain Prawns and bone marrow fillet with foie gras.  We shared a full prawn which had to be almost a foot long and then one portion of the bone marrow which my mouth is melting just writing this review.  I'm told both of these items are always on the menu.  I can't wait to try this place again."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the best hour! Kevin was amazing and he served us quality food. The flavors and presentation was everything!! Definitely coming back and that is why I'm giving them 5stars :)"}
{"text":"Very good food. The black cod is very delicious. The foei gras is so good with unique flavor and it is a must try. The mixed vegetables are also very good. The price is so reasonable. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"In need of an entertaining night and awesome food at a good price? Head over for their late night happy hour and sit outside on a cooler night, request the blonde waitress (she's hilarious and makes the best recommendations), order one of each taco, get some gyoza, and yakiudon or the fried rice. Don't forget to save room for dessert!   And for those of you with a million food allergies/intolerances, just let them know! They're super accommodating!"}
{"text":"You have to check out this place. Tasty food, affordable, clean & friendly staff. The food and service is great!"}
{"text":"Omg...  This place is awesome...  Say bone marrow...  Juicy and lots of flavors...  This place I would come again...."}
{"text":"We ate at Japaneiro last night for the first time and wanted to report and also give some updates.  First, they now serve beer, wine and sake; including Ashai on draft.  I had some excellent sake.  Also, there is some pretty nice otuside space for those that enjoy eating al fresco; it's finally getting cool enough in LAS to enjoy that, and it's quiet and pleasant outdoors.    We went at about 8 and we were the only folks there, which, based on our experience, is a real mystery.  We had a terrific meal, including top notch service.  Many of the itmes previously identified as specials are now on the regular menu, but htere was still a very signficant specials board.  Sadly, oysters, which we definitely wanted, were on the board, but had run out.  INstead, we had seaweed salad (simply but refreshing); salmon ceviche (ecellent, with a very fresh set of wonton chips and a nice zing to the ceviche itself); the 7 oz NY Strip steak grilled medium rare, with the sauces and salts (we really enjoyed this, including the portion size, which was just right to have a good tast of beef but not overwhelming); shrimp done on a sizzling plate with asparagus and onion (the winner of the evening; the shrimp were a perfect size, and cooked just to the point of doneness, and the sauce that accompanied them and vegetables had us wanting to lick it right off the red-hot plate); and finally, their combination friend rice, which was a very ample portion (we are still eating today) and nicely prepared, with a smoky rather than fatty taste.  As you can see, we did not go quite as deep into the unusal specials as we wil next time but everything we had was excellent, and clearly prepared with great care.  We spoke to the chef twice and assured him we would be back soon; he was cordial and clearly enjoyed the interaction.  He did send out two glasses of plum wine at the end of the evening, and it made a terrific and tasty finish to the meal."}
{"text":"Love this spot!  Came for a birthday dinner and drove right by it.  It's tucked away behind the Brentwood Cafe. I was apprehensive since I'm a vegetarian and there weren't really any veggie items on the menu, but still rallied because it was a birthday.  I told our server that I was a vegetarian and Chef Ken came out right away to ask me what I liked so that he could prepare a special tasting for me.  I was impressed!  We started with truffle edamame which was super delicious. I also ordered the spinach salad which I loved. The dressing is great; buttery, sweet and salty.  Chef Kevin kept sending me vegetarian delights all night. First he sent avocado tacos in a wonton shell,  then amazing enoki mushroom bouquets and for the main entr√©e tofu with spicy cilantro sauce and hollindaise with a fresh vegetable mix.  Vegetarians don't be scared give Japaneiro a shot.  Just request the vegetarian menu Chef Ken said he will be making this available :)"}
{"text":"This is the best Japanese fusion and I'm so glad we found it! It's a little bit hidden on warm springs/rainbow.  We ordered the bone marrow and it was delicious - way better than the steak houses here in Vegas.  Also the japaniero fried rice is amazing!! I could eat it everyday.  The owner is so friendly and nice, and makes you feel like family!"}
{"text":"Due to the good reviews of help, I decided to give a try to Japaneiro. It's good but I was expecting something way better."}
{"text":"Love this place it was absolutely delicious a true diamond in the rough. It's in the cut in this shopping center in a complex on the corner of Robindale and Tenaya. I have seen a few businesses come and go, I really hope this one survives! Amazing flavors we had the salmon ceviche, tuna tacos, tuna lotus chips, beef kushiyaki and lamb chops every single thing was out of this world!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem and never busy.  I love happy hour.  Try The rock shrimp. The chef is the best."}
{"text":"What a lucky find. Each and every dish was beautifully prepared with fine subtle tastes."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. Quality of ingredients and attention to detail is what is at this restaurant. We had the filet mignon tobanyaki and the king crab. It was soooo good. Hard to find restaurants with quality meat and seafood, not here it was awesome. Even the steamed rice was great! Keep it up guys and see you next time."}
{"text":"Food and staff are great! My only complaint is it's a little pricey for the portion of food you get, but it's great if you just want a few nibbles of something instead of a meal."}
{"text":"We randomly chose Japaneiro from the dozens of 4+ star off-the-strip places in Vegas.  The restaurant is in the back of a non-descript mall car-park, if for some strange reason you walked past you probably wouldn't look twice however this place is amazing.  Our server was fast, friendly and knew all the dish details, he provided great recommendations and kept our green tea cups full.  We shared a starter of beef gyoza, followed by salmon tacos and black cod wraps.  The gyoza had the right balance of crisp and soft with perfectly cooked filling.  Salmon tacos and cod wrap - nothing more to say other than wow.  At this point Kevin the head chef and owner came out to chat.  Interesting guy with a love of food and a very impressive restaurant resume to match.  Queue the mains of soft shell crab and Nigerian prawns with (our choice of) truffle butter.  The crab was perfect, if I was forced to critique I would say the prawn was a tiny bit firm but still excellent and the plate was left clean.  The food is on par and, with the starters, even exceeding some of the best high end asian fusion places on the strip.  Very highly recommended, will definitely be back.  PS. BYOB"}
{"text":"Came here last week with my parents and the food was spectacular with great services, we tried all the specialty foods. the sizzling Toban steak and the tacos was my favorite. If you want something different definitely come to this fusion restaurant."}
{"text":"The venue itself is pretty small but they do have a little outside area that you can sit at. We ordered the rib eye, filet mignon and bone marrow. The bone marrow is a very generous size for bone marrows. It was very well flavored and definitely one of the better bone marrows I've had. The rib eye and filet mignon was cooked to our liking and the seasoning done well. They also plate it with additional side spices that you can use to add flavor. There are no side dishes that come with the entree so if you need a side dish like me, you'll have to order side ala carte's.  The service was very slow. It was one of the slowest services I've had. It did take quite awhile for us to have our order taken and for the food to come out. That was the only downfall to the experience. The waiter was nice though.  They definitely seem to have a pretty decent array of Japanese alcohol. I didn't get to try them it looked pretty cool."}
{"text":"Really good Japanese fusion small plates. A lot of the dishes are similar to nobu for half the price. Very tasty . We are so glad we give them a try. When you are in Vegas instead of staying on the strip, should venture out.  So many great restaurants outside for a better value."}
{"text":"So. Good. Took my family from out of town here and we are all so full and satisfied. Kevin, the owner, is superb. Definitely will bring more family and friends here next time. Pictures included :)!"}
{"text":"The bone marrow filet with foie gras is every bit as good as it sounds. MUST ORDER. I don't know how so many decadent things work together so harmoniously, but they do. The unctuous coat of flavorful fat provided by the bone marrow and the richness of the foie gras on top of the tender piece of medium rare filet topped with truffle oil--truly incredible. Everything else we ordered was very delicious and beautifully presented, with a special shout-out to the delicious buttery black cod. But truly, after the bone marrow dish, I am not sure I recall of very much else from that night. It was that intoxicating."}
{"text":"Bomb!! Late Night Luxury!! Foie, scallops, truffles, uni, filet, tuna, oysters, bone marrow. Yes we ate them all!! All the great things that satisfy! We couldn't get enough. Just getting off work and craving the good life food!This is what dining is all about! I wish the new restaurants in town would go back to these items are what we want!!! Server was very friendly and she helped us decide . Chef was very kind and came out and spoke to us about each course. Go there now!!!!! Open late !!!!"}
{"text":"The best thing here is the truffle bone marrow with wonton chips. We ordered a variety of dishes- disappointing.  1) grilled octopus- chewy and barely tasted the grill flavor  2) Nigerian prawn with cilantro sauce- way overpriced, $30 for 1 prawn split in half. At that price, you might as well go to Milo's on the strip. 3) scallop with uni butter- lacked salt and seasoning  4) Chilean sea bass- it was the wrong type of fish, did not taste like sea bass. It should be buttery and tender flesh, if it's the real thing. 5) japaneiro special yakisoba- the shrimp tasted like it was frozen and it had a Indian chutney/spice after taste   I gave it a 3 stars for the presentation and bone marrow."}
{"text":"Very pricey but food was very good. Don't expect any large portions though.  And, order rice to get that feeling of being satisfied, otherwise expect to spend about $90 dollars or so before you get rid of that hungry feeling."}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat in the whole world.  Try the lotus chips and the uni oyster. Then the truffle bone marrow.  To die for."}
{"text":"Chef Kevin can cook! This is one of my ultimate favorite Vegas Local Japanese spot. Food is delicious and service is great! I only write yelp reviews if I 'm super excited about something. Trust! You have to try this place."}
{"text":"Walking into this intimate dining area, I was happily surprised to see the subtle differences from its past occupant. The lightening low, which I find makes the room have a nice glow.  We were seated promptly and greeted warmly by the kindest server. She was quite knowledgeable about the entire menu.  Which for me was a huge help. This was my first experience in Japanese fusion.  It was 5PM when we arrived and still happy hour. We ordered the Goyza, the beef taco and the butter lettuce wraps from the happy hour menu. All of the items arrived beautifully plated. My favorite was the beef taco. The beef so tender it melts in your mouth. The aioli with wasabi was the perfect creaminess.    We also ordered the spinach salad and noodles. My Dh loved the spinach salad. We both enjoyed the noodles with Jadori chicken. I am not a seafood eater, it was not my favorite. Still perfectly done, and presented beautifully.  The shining star of our meal was the 24 oz ribeye. This plate was so pretty we hated to eat it. It was more than enough for the two of us. I have honestly never had a better steak, even at fine steak houses. The chef brought out the true flavor of the steak. It was presented with a puree of mushrooms and truffle oil, a Peruvian spice dip, and a small sprinkle of salt and pepper. Each bite tender and flavorful. There was no room left for dessert, maybe on our next visit.  The service was outstanding. It was a pleasure to meet the chef. I enjoyed learning of his background. He appeared to me to be a chef who took pride in his craft.  The prices are more than reasonable for what you get.  For myself and my husband this was one of the best meals we have ever had.  We will come back to this wonderful establishment."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!!!!!! Customer service is excellent as well!  The Gyoza is to die!!!!!  It sort of tastes like a philly cheese steak or something. Or some kind of meatball?  It is the absolute best potsticker I have ever had!  I would actually come back JUST for these. Fried rice is amazing. Truffle edamame!!! YUM!!! The jidori chicken...... I've never had chicken melt in my mouth before!  Definitely coming back to this heaven they call Japaneiro!"}
{"text":"Selections are super good. You have to order the salmon ceviche and Hokkaido scallop sashimi . The best.  Their happy hour menu is also on point.  I always come during happy hour"}
{"text":"I love this place. We always go for happy hour around 11pm. Here are a few things we order,  Gyoza, this is a must!!! Fried rice Tacos, all of them Lotus  Salmon shasimi Rock shrimp A ice cold beer  Each order we ordered either triple or double the order. It's cheap and the quality of the food is awesome. Service is great and I have no complaints. When you check in you also get free adamame!!! Try this place, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was definately one of my favorite restaurants of 2016 and had the best tasting dish I had all year.  We were told about this restaurant from a family friend and when I was told the location I was super skeptical.  My mind didn't change when I walked in (but it was 11:30pm) and there were only 2 other tables there.  Weirdly, when we left at 1:30am it was busier than when we got there.  Parking is easy and plentiful since they are basically the only business there.  Some of the specials were sold out when we got there and the waiter had gone through letting us know which dishes he recommended.    Do get: Truffled Marrow Filet: OH HELL YES.  This dish was so freaking good.  After we finished most of it, we got a bowl of rice to soak up everything we didnt get the first time around and it was so damn good.   Scallop Sashimi  Escargot genmai ice cream (the brown one)  Good: Scallop with Foie Gras - the foie kind of over powers the scallop Toro with Uni - mine had a lot of tendon but the other two people didnt seem to have that problem Salmon Taco Black Cod wrap - good but its on the small side.   mochi with the green ice cream  Decent: Beef taco"}
{"text":"Most perfect late night dinner!!! If you'd like somewhere more intimate just you and your loved one this place is perfect.  Go anytime after 12pm for happy hour and most dishes are between $3-10   The food is always soooooo good no matter what time of the day."}
{"text":"This place never disappoint me food is always on point..  Chef Kevin and the Kitchen staff always do a phenomenal job...  Gotta have their Scallop Duo with Foie gras, grilled baby octopus, wagyu gyoza, soft shell crab with kabocha pumpkin sauce, black cod lettuce wrap with kataiffi, scallop ceviche, Alaskan king crab with truffle uni sauce, Nigerian prawns, bone marrow, and bone in Rib eye steak with Japaneiro signature truffle mushroom sauce..."}
{"text":"Perfectly seasoned , excellent service, very accommodating . I highly recommend japaneiro."}
{"text":"So we were looking forward to going to SOHO SUSHI but it was a 40 minute wait , I went on here and saw this place , I drove by it a few times in the past and saw it tucked away in the corner off warm springs completely hidden.  Let me tell you what his was one of the best meals I've had in a long time  We had the NY strip which comes sliced up perfectly with all these seasonings on the side as well a truffle sauce. We also had the Alaskan Cod and the truffle grilled edename. Basically everything we had was friggin amazing and the service was awesome since we were the only ones in there because they'd just opened at 6PM. Give this place a try you won't regret it...Oh and not overpriced at all.."}
{"text":"Love Chef Kevin's menu, super talented; definitely go with Omakase menu if it's your first time here. Scallops with Uni is a must, and try all of the in season dishes."}
{"text":"I just ate here last night and I'm trying to convince my girl friend to go back again tonight. Awesome fusion menu and specials. Prices are extremely reasonable. Personally I wanted to try a little bit of everything and I did....  Only downside, no alcohol. Yet."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the bone marrow with beef and foie gras. One of the best things I've ever eaten. The rest of the food was pretty good too. Slightly spotty service,  but friendly. They didn't tell me until 5 minutes after I ordered that they were out of the ribeye I ordered. Maybe I'll try it next time."}
{"text":"Very good food. The Chef is really nice and will make specialty items, and accommodated our Vegan request. Servers are all super friendly and attentive. I would come here again."}
{"text":"I live walking distance from this place so I felt obligated to try it. I was a little skeptical because if you have been disappointed by one Asian fusion restaurant... you get the point. Came here for the first time the day after getting back from a 3 week trip to Japan. My husband and I were not ready to give up the daily Japanese food that we were enjoying.   We walked in to a dark and romantic scene. Great quiet and relaxing ambiance. They had a chalk board full of fresh specials. I ordered a grilled Salmon fillet with spicy ponzu. It was phenomenal. Fish cooked the way it should be. Crip sear on the outside with a lightly raw middle- SO GOOD, and actual Ponzu made with yuzu.   Can't wait to go here again! Ideal for a date or dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour with a group of people. Had made reservations ahead of time just to make sure a table was set up for our group of 8. Sara was great at making sure everything was how it was supposed to be. It's been awhile since I was there so I don't exactly recall all that I had. I know I ordered the salmon & tuna tacos for sure which were good. Was disappointed that they didn't serve alcohol but they informed us that we could bring in our own w/o any extra fee. And it was my fault for not checking as I just assumed they did. (I believe they will be getting their license soon.) Opted to give my liver a break for the evening & stick to water. I'll go back for happy hour again."}
{"text":"The food was great especially the salmon and tuna taco!  The service was really great, very accommodating, in particular LOLA, our sever.  Hats off to you!"}
{"text":"We had to try everything. Their ice cream is amazing, too, and you can't go wrong with deep fried bananas. Sometimes its can be little bit pricey so 35."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this place because of the Yelp reviews. So glad we did. Undoubtedly the new favorite spot, and we are foodies so we don't take this lightly. We live very close to this place, which is also very close to the strip so we have a lot to choose from.   Started with the tuna tacos and lettuce wrap Seabass which both were bomb and tasty. Then was tempted with the sake flight to rinse away some beef topanyaki and char grilled octopus to settle in the delicious teaser then The chef brought out a specialty oyster with foie gras. Nigerian prawn, fillet with bone marrow, forget it. It's too much to mention. Everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant in a nondescript location! The wait staff (Lolo!) and the chef talking to us about the dishes and questions we had, the entire crew was great. And the food, divine. My husband and I frequent many of the high end restaurants on the strip, and the food here definitely had high end tastes! The Seabass and black cod were amazing, the A5+ Waygu with all the salts was perfect. Our group of three shared everything and tried many of the dishes, not a one was not notable. The only negative to us was finding out they had been open for over a year and we hadn't visited them yet! Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"A little expensive, but a thoughtful wine by the glass section.  Both my husband and I found everything a bit too sweet for our taste.  However, everything was thoughtfully prepared.  The service was genuine and responsive."}
{"text":"Wow we found our new favs resto. This place is amazing. The appetizer menus are ok bit the specialty food and dinner food is out of this world. We order the black cod and the bone marrow with beef. Wow wow wow. The toro with uni and salmon sashimi was awesome. Definitely coming back to this place to try the different menu items. Food is a little pricey but all worth it."}
{"text":"Fresh and the taste is incredible. It's not expensive. Better then a strip restaurant .The chef is nice and creative."}
{"text":"A tiny place packed with flavor & charm!  Walking in you immediately take in all the goodies that are on the grill! The aroma is phenomenal!   We decided to check this place out and took advantage of the happy hour which didn't disappoint. We literally tried everything from the small menu and it was all filing. Every little bite was really packed with flavor and let's start from the beginning -  The gyoza's were filled with tender meat and steamed to perfection. The tuna trio which was tuna, salmon & beef were crispy and all fillings tender. The tuna & salmon lotus chips were all one bites and sweet, creamy & spicy. The beef & chicken skewers came over hot off the grill, so delicious! The sea bass & cod bites were by far my favorite and I wanted more! And now to the desserts - both very unique. The tiramisu came with a side of green tea ice cream which was a fun combo of flavors and the fried banana egg rolls had chili powder sprinkled over them along with some honey. This dish came with milk tea ice cream that was fantastic! I could eat that ice cream anytime...  The intimate space was very cute and it felt very cozy. Service was fantastic and the chef came out to say hi to the first timers. He was very sweet! I am looking forward to going back and trying things off the main menu!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and a cool local spot to chill. The staff is super nice and the chef is really cool. The food is amazing. At par or even better than some of the restaurants on the strip doing Japanese fusion. The sea bass was perfect and the sauce went perfectly with it. Jeffrey one of the servers is really nice and helpful with suggesting items.  I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I'm a huge uni fan so when I saw pictures of the special dishes with uni here, I HAD to find my way here! To give you an idea of how badly my friend and I wanted to come here during our stay in Vegas, we did a 1-day car rental just to drive here to eat. (We are very serious about our food adventures!)  Our waitress, Lolo, is an absolute sweetheart. She totally understands the importance of our camera eating first ;). When she brought out the scallop with uni dish, the uni slid off the scallop while she was putting the plate down. Without us even asking her to, she immediately brought it back to the kitchen so the chef can put the uni back on top of the scallop so we can take our picture.  We came on a Wednesday night around 9:30pm, so we can do the late happy hour in addition to the special dishes. We ordered:  Uni Bites Truffle Bone Marrow Uni Scallop Shigoku Oysters Uni Chawanmushi Tuna Lotus Chip (HH) Salmon Tacos (HH)  My favorite was the uni chawanmushi. The seafood broth with steamed egg custard was such a perfect, delicate balance. I think I would've liked the scallop with uni better if it was a raw scallop. I personally don't like cooked or seared scallops.  Everything we tried was delicious and Japaneiro definitely met and went beyond our expectations. Just when we thought things couldn't get any better, the chef brought out an extra dish for us on the house!! He found out we came all the way from NY and rented a car just to eat here. He gave us black cod with foie gras in a lettuce wrap! And oh my god, it was so good. He also added caviar onto the oysters for us. (Thank you!!! ^__^)  This meal was definitely on the pricier side, considering we came here for more of a \"snack.\" We already had dinner around 6pm and came here just to try the special dishes. Between four people, we each paid around $40 after tip/tax."}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to like this place but it fell short. Two waiters were very friendly. We always start with aps to test the waters. If aps don't fly, we don't order anything else. Did not like the Gyoza - sauce too sweet and meat almost tasted undercooked. Lettuce cups with Black Cod tasted TOO fishy. Tacos and lotus chips, not impressed - Soho Restaurant's much better. Rock Shrimp was bland."}
{"text":"For the people who are up for a real food adventure, this is one unique restaurant that you can't miss! It's located in a quiet corner on Warm Springs&Rainbow blvd, a distance away from the strip but trust me, the food here is gonna make your day For the people who like to have a little bit of everything, the menu is specially designed for a purpose of \"sharing is caring\"! The chef cooks with passion and that is how he makes his customers smile at every bite they take  Aaaahhhhhhh! I just wanna try everything on the menu, cz I don't think that I can find it anywhere else..."}
{"text":"came here with a group of friends for their late night special and the food turns out to be okay maybe the regular menu taste better. I had there shrimp special but I found it to be too spicy. I had to finish it because it was way too spicy for my friend."}
{"text":"Very friendly service, but it all went downhill from there. I looked at the reviews (here) and it was mostly great, so I decided to take my girlfriend here to celebrate our anniversary. Horrible mistake!  When we arrived (and even when we left), we were the only ones dining. We were greeted by our waitress Lolo, who was very nice and knowledgeable on the entire menu. However, the list of dishes were somewhat confusing: no images nor descriptions on the menu, and the specials on the wall board were lengthy and all required a vocal description from the waitress. It required a good 5 minutes to understand the menu.  I ordered the lotus chips w/ scallops, fried rice, yakisoba noodles, Nigerian prawns broiled w/ truffle butter, and the tobanyaki w/ filet mignon. The lotus chips were expensive ($10), but somewhat worth the price. Don't expect to be filled, but it was good representation of what Asian fusion food is all about. The fried rice and yakisoba noodles were, on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the best, an 8. The Nigerian prawns were delicious, but for $26... again, don't expect to be filled. Finally and unfortunately, the tobanyaki w/ filet mignon... it just never came out. I waited patiently for 40 minutes and after I politely inquired to the waitress, I was told that the order was never placed!  I'm torn how to feel about the service. The waitress was very nice and seemed forgiving, but after saying sorry twice, she acted like the situation never happened. For a restaurant that only had one customer dine-in for the two-hour window that we were there, you would think that they would make efforts to make me a happy customer. Perhaps offer to serve me the filet mignon on the house or if that's too much, maybe discounted? Or compensate by waiving another item off the menu, or offer a substitute that can be made fast.  As my girlfriend and I left, we didn't sense much sympathy. As we walked out and into our car, we passed by a couple staff members who didn't greet or thank us.  - If you are looking to be filled, DON'T COME HERE. Portions are too small for the price. - If you are on a date, DON'T COME HERE. If I was the only one dining and received a questionable experience, what makes you think you'll receive exceptional service?  I could have taken my girlfriend to an AYCE sushi restaurant and we would've been much happier. I don't like wishing bad on any business, but it's hard to imagine this place staying operational for much longer if they couldn't give great service to the only two customers they had for a 2-hour window."}
{"text":"Amazing Japanese-French Fusion hole-in-the-wall, Well worth the $10 trip from the strip for some creative food. Would go again."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I had bookmarked this place a long time ago and had been itching to try this place out and I'm happy I did! When walking in, you are instantly greeted and shown to a table - depends on how busy it is I'm assuming. They hand you a menu and tell you the daily specials and what's popular. The daily specials are also written on the wall! The only downside is they don't have any alcohol yet but they will soon.  For the appetizers, we got the beef, tuna, and salmon tacos. One order comes with two so you can easily share with someone. We also got the rock shrimp. The shrimp were big and the sauce wasn't too overpowering so it was delicious. The presentation of the food was really nice too - I felt like I was in some type of super fancy restaurant on the strip.   For dinner, we got the miso black cod and chilean sea bass. And oh boy! it was soooo good. The presentation of the food was also on point. The miso black cod literally melted in my mouth. It was cooked to perfection and I plan on going again this weekend to eat it again haha It came with seaweed salad on the side. The chilean sea bass was  little bigger but it was also equally delicious. It came with two sauces on the plate that was used as decor - one was green, the other was yellow - I personally preferred the green sauce over the yellow.   I didn't have enough room for dessert because I had stuffed my face with the appetizers but I plan on trying one this weekend when I go again! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING I mean absolutely amazing. And I'm not just saying that because I say that about most businesses I mean this is actually THE BEST. From Their price point to their food quality it is AMAZING. Like they have really cheap food to moderately expensive but whatever you choose will still be delicious. I got all the dishes from the happy hour menu and I also got a tobanyaki steak that they brought to our table still HOT and this dish could've been a $100 dish easy but it was way cheaper. The service is super friendly the waitress and the owner were very very friendly and the service was very good, very fast and not rude or ignored us. The owner even came and talked to us for a bit and he used to work at Caesars palace at Nobu the very high class restaurant and he decided to open a restaurant with cheaper food than the strip of his own off the strip and I think that was a fantastic idea because us locals need some of this quality food too. If I could I would give this place 6 stars for how wonderful my dining experience was. Oh and to add they had beautiful interior design and their desserts were ON POINT. I got the banana harumaki and the milk tea ice cream and the milk tea ice cream was pretty amazing. I've never tried milk tea before but this place is definitely worth the visit I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!! It may be a little hidden but you'll see it if you keep your eyes open"}
{"text":"Was in town for CES and went there twice, first for dinner and then a 2nd night for the late-night happy hour (10p-12a).  Between the 2 nights, we had tacos, lettuce wraps (both the black cod and Chilean sea bass), rock shrimp, house salad, salmon on lotus chips, European sea bass, beef Tobanyaki, bone marrow, duck confit. chicken and beef kushi (yakitori-like mini skewers). For dessert, we had yuzu/orange sorbet (1st night) and coconut/lychee sorbet (2nd night.)   Loved everything, with favorites being the chicken kushi (really tender and flavorful chicken with an amazing sesame dressing). European sea bass (so good we ate the bones which were fried and dramatically presented), bone marrow (with mouth-watering truffle butter), and duck confit (tender and delicious).  The salad dressing was awesome, and the sea bass had a sauce that nicely balanced the delicate fish.  Both sorbet desserts were outstanding.   Chef Kevin (formerly at Nobu in Caesars) is talented and creative. As others had pointed out, the restaurant is in the process of getting a liquor license, but you can bring your own wine/sake. Definitely 5 stars for the food.  I would also give 5 stars for the wait staff who were attentive and very welcoming.   The only downside is that the ambiance is not exactly of a \"special occasion\" restaurant caliber even though the cuisine itself is very high caliber on both the quality of the ingredients and the chef's skills.  The place is in a strip mall southwest of the Strip.  Inside, you can see the ice machine and drinks refrigerator from the dining area.  Of course, you're not paying special-occasion restaurant prices either.  Their regular prices are very good compared to similar caliber food one can get on the Strip. The prices are downright fantastic during happy hours (from lunch time to 6p) and the late-night happy hours (approx. half off on select menu items.)  I wish Chef Kevin and Japaneiro lots of success since I want to go back next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with this place.  The food was nothing short of gourmet and the staff was amazing.  Everything on the menu was affordable, and they even offer a happy hour menu.   I decided on the tuna tacos, seaweed salad, and beef gyoza.  The first bite made it abundantly clear that the chef is passionate about what he does.  The tuna had amazing flavor, and was complimented by the light crispy texture of the shell.  The seaweed was plated like a work of art.  The beef was plated with two sauces, both complimenting it's flavor profile.   Japaneiro is a breath of fresh air in a city occupied with overpriced disappointments."}
{"text":"Amazing! Everything we tried was delicious and our server was adorable.  She was passionate about the menu and gave great recommendations. I love a great restaurant that I don't have to make the trip to the strip for. I will be telling everyone to try it out and we will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Great place! Hubby and I originally were supposed to go to the oyster bar for our post Valentine's date, but due to the long wait, we just decided to try something else. We checked yelp reviews for restaurants around our house, and saw the high ratings for Japoneira, so we decided to check this place out. I'm actually really glad we got the chance to come here as all the food we ordered were excellent, not to mention the great happy hour deals.   We ordered a bunch of items from the happy hour menu, including the salmon and tuna tacos, rock shrimp, and the cod wrapped in lettuce. The tacos were great but quite generic with other fusion restaurants and their tacos, as mentioned in another review, nevertheless still quite good. The rock shrimp was yummy, crispy on the outside embellished in great tasting sauce. The cod was to die for~ it was so good that we just had to order the regular sized cod from the dinner/main menu. We also ordered the salmon ceviche that tasted like the salmon inside the taco, oysters which tasted really good considering I'm not really an oyster fan, and also the foie gras mini blinis. My husband, who had bad experience with foie gras, really liked this dish as it was buttery and the sauce drizzled over it paired really well. Lastly, we ordered the japoneira fried rice and, as I mentioned above, the cod. I just have to say it again... I absolutely loved the fish! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!!!   The service was exceptional. Our server was very friendly and accommodating, and explained each dish to us at it came out. Too bad we didn't catch her name though, but for sure we'll see her again next time we go. All in all, great service, excellent food, awesome experience. Will definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"As far out as it was the drive was worth it... I'm a very big guy that loves to eat and this was actually the least I have ever eaten in my life yet the most satisfied. Yes the meals are pricey but as the saying goes \" cheap work ain't good and good work ain't cheap \"  if you are looking for quality and great food there's no reason why you shouldn't stop in and eat."}
{"text":"Came to try the menu and it was a tasty tasty treat. If you love uni this is the place for you. They have an uni butter they put on some items that's to die for. Also their bone marrow was amazing. Only bad thing was their was a faint sewage smell but not too off putting for us."}
{"text":"The restaurant was everything I was looking for. I was craving truffle, bone marrow and foie gras. Their signature filet dish had all three! It was delicious, not too decadent but just right. The presentation on everything was amazing. We met the owner and he was extremely nice and humble. We will definitely be coming again once we return to Vegas. Truly a gem!"}
{"text":"Five stars all around!  Staff is incredible! I have as of yet dined anywhere in Las Vegas were servers a re truly passionate, incredibly knowledgable, and so incredibly kind! Excellent direction in navigating the menu to find what you'll like along with perfectly timed dishes. They are so helpful and approachable!  The owner came out often to talk to tables ensuring they enjoyed their experience, as well as chat and answer any questions first time diners might have. He was so nice and gave me suggestions of specials that they would have in the future he thought I would enjoyed. He extra effort added to the experience.  Now onto the good stuff... The food!!! Everything was beyond expectations. I had the  uni sampler, which consisted of a tasting of uni from Santa Barbara, Catalina Island, and imported from Japan. They were served on spoons with seaweed and ikura. The seaweed gave great texture against the soft uni and the brininess of the seaweed and ikura paired perfectly with the soft sweet uni.  I also had the seared scallops and foie gras. I swear if I had been standing my knees would have given out. It was the most spectacular bites I've had in quite some time.  I also had their baby octopus with miso and once again if you are a fan of octopus, you'll love this dish.  Right now it's BYOB so I suggest bringing your favorite \"inebriator\", a couple friends, settle in and share a little bit of everything. Also they have double happy hour and early and late.  Have fun!"}
{"text":"Only bad review in this place is no liquor license yet. But all the food were great- the toro, uni and bone marrow were simply amazing.   The owner is very friend. Wait staff is very helpful."}
{"text":"The food here is to die for. The bone marrow, the uni, and the fois gras are must haves"}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour that starts at 12:30 pm with 1.50 tacos Asian themed beef, tuna and salmon.    Beef kushi skewers are also very good and mango cheesecake beyond awesome!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch, got a chicken bento and beef gyoza for about 15 bucks... Talented chefs with quality food, and good service.  I can definitely recommend it.  Edit: I've been here like 5 times now and I've had most the menu, and I'd say half the menu is great and the other half is ok.. So it averages out to slightly above average for me.."}
{"text":"Out of this world!!! The 7 course meal is a must. The owner/chef waited our table. This added to our dining experience."}
{"text":"We loved all the dishes we ordered especially salmon tacos. Some dishes are slightly too saucy for me but I loved all the fusion dishes that chef thought out well. Presentation is as nice as the taste.  We happened to be the only guests at the night and were able to talk to the chef who was pretty nice.  We will go back there every time we go to vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious treat hidden in an obscure and mostly empty strip mall.  The presentation was gorgeous and the food was delicious.  A friend of mine did the Omakase for $90.00 and basically received a tasting of the menu's highlights including foie gras, bone marrow, salmon belly ceviche and others!  I had the surf and turf which gave you the choice of prawns or scallops for the surf and lamb chops or steak for the turf, I got the steak and scallops both of which were cooked perfectly and accompanied by a delicious and innovative sauce."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here this last Sunday on the recommendation from a friend.  I was told that I had to get the beef bone marrow truffle filet.  This is the signature dish by the Chef.  I have never had anything like this before but it was freaking MIND BLOWINGLY DELICIOUS!!!!!  The beef is certified Japanese beef that almost melts in your mouth.  The bone marrow is lightly charred and so flavorful.  The sauce that accompanies it sets it off!  My wife and I also ordered seaweed salad, the black cod lettuce wraps, the Scotland salmon sashimi, the land and sea tobanyaki, and finished it off with tiramisu &a green tea ice cream.  Everything was delicious and beautifully prepared.  Also the staff was genuinely friendly and attentive.  I make note of this because sometimes I don't feel this same genuine attitude in Vegas.  If you are in Vegas and want good stuff off the strip that is the same quality/surpasses the quality of the strip, hit up Japa√±eiro Asian Infusion!  We will definitely go back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"They took care of the sulfur smell problem.  We were fighting over the soft shell crab.  It was outstanding.  The house special fried rice was full of shrimp, chicken, and steak.  The shrimp yakisoba was as good as any I had in Japan, with more shrimp.  The steam egg with uni, ikura, and mushroom just knock my taste bud into another dimension.  The tacos, man, I can just get like ten of them and call it a night.  Any filling will do!  I can see this as a regular stop except for the drive."}
{"text":"Yum. Amazing food, more people need to give this place business. Friendly wait staff and humble chef."}
{"text":"I took my daughter here to celebrate her twenties first birthday and everything were very delicious. We ordered edamame truffle oil, rock shrimp, salmon and tuna taco, foie gras, truffle marrow filet, Australian lamb chop, house special soba, house special fried rice and green tea ice cream. My favorite are tuna taco, truffle marrow filet, and Australian lamp chop. We came back today because we had such a wonderful experience and the food were so good from the first visit but today the food was not good, everything came out a little cold and my favorite truffle marrow filet was a little bit chewy not tender like the last time"}
{"text":"Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.  The Uni - fresh. sweet. melt in your mouth goodness.  The bone marrow topped with Filet Mignon - if you like bone marrow, you'll love what they're doing and spreading the marrow on top of FM, delicious way to try it if you've never had it.  Order the pinot noir, it's Meiomi. It's delicious.  The Gyoza is stuffed with beef. Yumoza.  And late night dinning, which we have told our son about so he can afford to take a dat or meet college friends is happy hour from 11pm to 3am. Yep. They don't skimp 'cause it's happy hour. Same menu, super affordable."}
{"text":"I really want to like this restaurant but the menu is very small and the service is really awkward.   I came here on Thursday night and it was completely empty. The ambience was not what I excepted. It's very small and narrow and the decor needs a little change.   There's only two sides on the menu. I just went with the cod wrap, salmon taco, tuna taco, and udon fried noodles, and rock shrimp with the check in offer.  The cod wrap was good but not memorable. The tacos were also good but very very tiny. I do have to admit that the shell they used for the tacos were addicting to eat. The udon fried noodles were surprisingly amazing to me! It had very good flavor and the noodles were cooked perfectly al dente.   The service was awkward from beginning to start. I wish I can explain but it was that awkward. The girl also forgot our rock shrimp but maybe she shouldn't be just sitting around the kitchen area eating and drinking with the chef or whoever that was."}
{"text":"Gem!! Love this place! I wandered in one evening on a whim and I'm so glad I did.   First visit, I had the NY Strip with Foie Gras. It was drizzled with a heavenly sauce that was similar to teriyaki, but there was something about it that was different than I'd ever tasted. Can't put my finger on it. But I LOVE when I get to taste flavors that I have never experienced. The steak was cooked perfectly, was beautifully presented, and the service was excellent.   A couple days later I couldn't wait to go back, so I brought my hubby. We shared a few small plates: scallop w/foie, salmon lotus chip, gyoza, and truffle edemame. For my entree, I chose the filet with truffle bone marrow, my hubby chose the NY steak Tobanyaki. The scallop w/foie was insanely good and a must-have if you enjoy seafood. And as funny as it sounds, the edamame was quite delicious. Not your typical steamed flavorless starter. Hubby's entree was delightful, served on a sizzling platter. Personally, I preferred the other preparation (I'm less of a sauce person) but it was very similar. The truffle bone marrow filet was incredible. I'm not much of a filet person (too lean) but it was actually a nice balance between that and the marrow. Everything about this dish was wonderful. Another dish I must mention is the Nigerian prawn sigh uni butter. Do not pass this one up!  The format of the menu is basically a list of the names of the dishes with no explanation or description, so it can be a little confusing. Don't be afraid to ask the awesome servers to explain it to you. They're very helpful and lead me in the right direction."}
{"text":"Favorite happy hour in town with great fresh food with awesome prices.  Presentable food dishes too!!!  Nice, clean environment with staff at your service.  They're always friendly and welcoming.  Love this place"}
{"text":"So we had seen this place was a sushi restaurant before and that placed closed down , then we heard a new Japanese place bought the space and re vamped it into something , this place truly is special , it's not really sushi per say it's not totally Japanese it stands on its own , with options ranging from styles of French cuisine and Raw fish options like there \"salmon tacos\" which are an wonton wrapper fried and molded like a taco shell filled with raw salmon that had been marinated in miso and some other goodness , this place truly is special it doesn't replace my sushi place but rather adds a new category for something new to try , menu is constantly evolving and the staff was amazing our waitress \"lolo\" knew everything about three menu and talked us thru suggestions favorites and and made us feel welcome , this was all after midnight so the fact there open late with and amazing happy hour menu it really places this resturant in a field of its own , we will def come back ."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Japaneiro the other night-what a great find!  It is tucked away in a little strip mall and you would totally miss it if you din't know it was there. The place is super small and fills up quick but definitely worth the trip out to the burbs!  We were there for happy hour and the prices were amazing for the quality of food. The Rock Shrimp, Salmon Tacos, Beef skewers-all were super tasty and fish really fresh. Had the hazelnut cheesecake for dessert which was really rich and creamy. Service was on point. Gotta check this place out!"}
{"text":"My friend recommend this place and to be honest this place is diamond in the rough.  Possibly worthy of Michelin. As good or better than Nobu in las vegas. Must try or make it your must restaurant every time you in vegas...so good literally every dish is guaranteed to melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"Absolutely amaze balls late night happy hour.. Our server Trish was on point. Some of the best service I've ever received. The chef personally brought our meal to the table. The food was excellent and the plating was beautiful. All in all I'll definitely be back. A little south west hidden gem."}
{"text":"Went into this restaurant by accident and was actually pleasantly surprised. I've driven past the restaurant tons of times and finally googled it to look at the menu. The entire menu looked delicious so we decided to have dinner there. We got to the restaurant and were handed different menus and realized that the first result on google I clicked on was for a restaurant in Texas with the same name. After looking at their menu we weren't really sure about eating here because we're not the most adventurous eaters and the menu had some very interesting and unique items. We wanted to give it a shot so we ordered a seaweed salad and a steak qyoza. The gyoza were quite possibly the most flavorful and delicious gyoza I've ever had and we could not believe how amazing they were. We ended up ordering a second order of gyoza because they were so amazing. I wish we were brave enough to step out of our comfort zone and try some of there other menu items but at least we now know where to get the best gyoza in town. If the gyoza are any reflection of the restaurants quality and flavor, I'm sure every thing else on the menu must be superb."}
{"text":"Best food I've had in a long time. Can't say enough about the truffle marrow filet. Absolutely delicious!!!!  The scallop with foie gras was an explosion of flavor, loved it!!! Great restaurant off the strip that is sure to impress!!!"}
{"text":"What's the Japanese word for magisterial? That's what this place is. The Alaska Black Cod was glorious. My life is good now."}
{"text":"very slow service, came in for 10 mins, no.one ask if we need any drinks...no water... they explained because of the big party... they call 6 ppl big party... Service was not bad just too slow... food is just ok, nothing amazing... but overprice, service and food not worth the price...not recomend, wikl not come back"}
{"text":"Food is always excellent! This place is a little tucked back but offers food that you blow you away."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and it might just be my new favorite spot! I let my friend do the ordering and everything was delicious! We had the rock shrimp, beef tacos, truffle oil edamame, chicken yakiudon, and black cod butter lettuce. It's rare you come to a place and truly enjoy everything you order. Our server was outstanding and the chef came out to make sure we enjoyed everything! Ended up ordering more tacos. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came in before 12am and the wait times were so dragged out, couldn't get out until 2am. Took nearly 30mins before we got our drinks (water/soda) and another 10 to order! Nearly 1hr just to start eating. The server was great but definitely spread thin.   Food was good although some wouldn't be worth trying if it wasn't happy hour. Desserts were even better. The local community seems to enjoy the work of the chef but that same chef pays no attention to newcomers, we were last out and no apologies for out of stock items and no bye or thank you. Must need to provide a consistent profit before you're on good terms."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a restaurant where you ordered a light meal thinking that was going to be enough but after you ate your food it was a battle for you to say no more, cause the food you ate was just delicious? Well that's what exactly happened to me today. I wasn't hungry, just killing time, and Japaniero was just there. I ordered a few of their apps and after eating most of it the battle happen. You can say I'm writing a review a little prematurely. The 4 star that I gave could possibly be higher, after I have more of the food which I'm pretty sure will happen in the next couple of days. Expect an update soon and more pictures.  The #1 thing that got me, before I even ate anything, was their customer service. I just left my car and was walking to the building when I was already being welcomed by one of the girls who worked there, I was probably just lucky since it seemed like the only business in that building and I was walking towards her. Once inside everyone, which included one of the chefs, was very nice and friendly, asked how I heard about them, recommended items, briefly conversed with me while I was there. They all even stopped what they were doing and said thank you as I left. They seemed genuinely appreciative of me being there.   So as it goes for food I ordered only a few items, all which were from their Happy Hours menu. I believe Happy Hours runs 12:30pm-6pm and 10pm-midnight Mondays-Fridays and 2pm-6pm Saturday-Sunday, which are pretty sweet.  Went with a beef taco, an order of black cod butter lettuce wrap, and an order of tuna lotus chips. Each item was reexplained as it was brought out but I don't remember the whole details because I was enjoying and savoring the item that came out before. They were small in size but everything was delicious.  The rest of the menu sounds delicious, look at the pictures posted. Also check the chef special menu http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/japaneiro-asian-infusion-restaurant-las-vegas?select=02DBC79VhN80Y-RRzyh3BA#02DBC79VhN80Y-RRzyh3BA There was mention of dessert by the server, a milk tea ice cream and a green tea creme brulee, need to try those.  It is a small place http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/japaneiro-asian-infusion-restaurant-las-vegas?select=L7N_-J-m6WrriqvDQIBZhA#L7N_-J-m6WrriqvDQIBZhA with a few tables outside and near the kitchen.  Shame on me for writing a review after one visit and eating 3 apps. I guess I need to go back tomorrow."}
{"text":"this place is definitely a hidden treasure. I first went for dinner to try it out, and everything we ordered was very delicious. We went there a 2nd time, just for the happy hour time and ordered as much as we could.We ate almost everything on the menu, and I'm sure everything else we didn't try is all great too! Once again, everything we ordered was so delicious! Would Highly Recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"My favorite late night happy hour in LV going til 3am for high quality eats at a good price. Can never pass up on the salmon tacos & yaki soba! Place is super small but service has always been good. We always make it a point to visit when were in the area, totally worth driving out to."}
{"text":"Go here now. This food is good! Service is friendly. Food comes out quickly. We ate almost everything on the happy hour menu...all winners.    Gyoza is actually something special. They're handmade in their kitchen and not bought frozen like most places. Salmom belly ceviche was outstanding! Salmon on lotus chips, my 9 year old ate 2 whole orders by himself. Everybody loved the beef skewers. Black cod lettuce wraps were standard recipe, only the miso wasnt overbearing. Yakiudon, delicious. Fried rice, good (not as fantastic as other items). Fried rice flavor was spot on, but the rice could have used a bit more toasting/charring.   All in all, an awesome meal. I'm sending all my friends there right away."}
{"text":"Kevin is awesome. He was friendly and he has created an amazing menu. The food was great with fresh ingredients, you can taste the quality! The prices were reasonable. The restaurant is small but if there is a wait, it's worth it.  We had Gyoza, Rock Shrimp, Truffle Oil Edamame, Fried Rice and Tacos (Salmon and Beef).... I would order everything ok. It was all delicious. Also... the coconut sake was amazing!!! We will be back."}
{"text":"The new hottest spot in Las Vegas! If you love modern Japanese style cuisine, this place is for you!  The chefs of the restaurant get their supplies every morning and their menu and specials change everyday according to whatever they buy that day. You can have something completely different one meal and the next time you're back, they can have a different menu! I love places like these because you know that you are getting something fresh and different every time.   The chefs of this place used to work for Nobu so do not expect anything mediocre. You are getting Las Vegas Strip quality of food, but at a local price with no hassle of going to the Strip. This restaurant is brand new, but for how it is going so far, this restaurant is only going to go far! Everything is amazing and this has to be my new favorite modern Japanese spot off the strip!  Ambience: The moment you walk in, you are greeted kindly by servers. The restaurant is small, but it is very intimate and romantic. The designs are simple, but elegant and they have a chalkboard where they write their specials that day.  Service: Yet again, LAS VEGAS STRIP QUALITY! The servers may be young, but they are energetic and they know what they are doing. The chefs and owners come out and talks to you. How often do you get that from chefs? They care about what you think of the food and your experience so far.  Food: Where do I begin? I ordered a few things and here are some of what I tried so far.  Truffle Oil Edamame Tuna, Salmon & Beef Tacos Potstickers Sugar Daddy soft shell crab Uni Shots Uni Chawanmushi Fliet Mignon Tobanyaki  (They are one of the few angus beef certified restaurants in the valley!) Foie Gras  Green Tea Tiramisu Home-made black sesame ice-cream Fried banana  Green tea is BOMB! They use the highest quality of green tea straight from Japan!  Everything I had was amazing! I am drooling just thinking about this.....  Overall, this restaurant is one of the places I have tried off the strip that has the same Strip quality of food and service you would get at a 5 STAR restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love this place, generous portions of food that taste great, the service was exceptionally fast and friendly, would recommend this place to friends and family with small or large parties.... the miso black cod was excellent !!!"}
{"text":"Why I love food is places like this. Only the best ingredients, passionate chef who loves what he does, something exciting to look at, with great flavor and well prepared.  This place should be packed every night ... If we want incredible eating off the strip... Gotta represent Vegas.  And he's not even pricey. Run don't walk!"}
{"text":"I've literally eaten the entire menu.  This is my favorite place in Vegas. I have gone very often since this place has opened.  There are so many foods that I will only eat here. As for people who don't understand why some of the plates are so small, I feel that we need to keep in what this restaurant is know that it is possible to get complete full there and not break the bank.  To keep this review from being incredibly log with detailing out each dish I've had and what it is and what I think.  I'll just hit the highlights.  -Japanese Teramoto Scallop: Get this one.  Just cough up the extra few bucks for the this one instead of the Hokkaido scallop.  Yes, you can taste the difference. Get a side of rice.  Dump the left over sauce on the rice. Smile and enjoy your life.  -Rock Shrimp: This has actually gotten smaller from the original portion size back when he first opened. I'm fine with that. It was very large for an appetizer; now, it seems about right.  -Bone Marrow Filet: The dish that holds the distinction as something that made me stop and phone a friend to tell them how good it is. It was originally on the specials board. Rightfully so, it has made it to the actual menu.  The new bone in filet is fantastic too! Very good quality.  I'm just a bit of a steak snob, so I will say there is better in Vegas.  For the price, it is a stand out.  -Scallop Foie Gras: It's the perfect bite to me. Point blank. Period.   -French Escargot: If you've never had one, this is a great place and price to try one. I've had better in other places in town, but it is still solid here.  -Black Cod Butter Lettuce: Solid item. Crazy good for a happy hour dish.  -Gyoza: On the menu is the black Angus beef which is fantastic.  I believe there was a kobe beef one on the specials board a few year ago. Mind blowing!  -Yakisoba: It's really good here if you are trying to fill up and are a fried noodle kind of person.  -Tasting menus: I think there has been a 10, 5, and now 7.  If you want to check this place out, grab a friend and try this. Nigerian prawn and scallop ceviche typically make this menu.  Both are solid.  The marrow filet is also usually on here.  Other notes: If you are fan of Japanese beers, there is a decent selection here of stuff you would actually want to drink that is not widely available in town.  I've done the sake flight.  It was good, but I'm not a connoisseur. I feel like my opinion would be uninformed at best. The sparkling jelly sake was interesting in a good way. Also know the special board can change often. The hairy crab 3 ways is a great one if available."}
{"text":"We will definitely be back! Found this place randomly and it was amazing! Enjoyed edamame with truffle oil, the lotus chips were delicious, and probably the best scallops I have ever had! Great place and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate graduation with my family and it was the first time I got to enjoy Japanese-Brazilian style food. The restaurant itself is nestled in a sleepy little plaza just off the highway to the southwest, so it had a rather humble appearance from the outside. The prices were amazing for the quality of food that we were getting, something that I became keenly aware of by the time the main entrees began to roll out.  My table ordered a whole collection of dishes that I had trouble recollecting all of them: lamb chops, sashimi plates, oysters, seaweed/house salads, fried rices, and yakisobas, I believe. They were all quite pleasant, and I had no complaints of their flavors (well, the lamb was a tiny bit dry), but I wanted to zoom in on two dishes that really \"did it\" for me.  I ordered the Alaskan black cod and it was my first time ordering this particular fish. It was a perfectly-cooked strip of fish served with a lotus chip, a nice little leaf garnish underneath, and a mizo glaze. When I took a bite, the meat was so delicate that it practically melted on my tongue and released all of the sweet, savory, almost buttery flavors of the miso it was cooked in. I ate the skin separately and it was even better, as it concentrated all of that sauce under a lightly crisped exterior.  At the end of our dinner, we were served a set of desserts, mostly different ice creams, and this curious yuzu-coconut mochi served on a little mound of green tea ice cream in a goblet-sized wooden spoon that, for whatever reason, absolutely amused my entire table; some of my family requested the owner's permission to take the spoons home (I don't get it either). The mochi was decidedly refreshing and, for me, a nice change of pace from the standard green tea and red bean mochis served at many Japanese-themed restaurants.  The real kicker had to be the tiramisu. I was not ready for it. I didn't realize that I've been having garbage tiramisu until this point. First off, the plating was charming. The tiramisu was a square-cut piece of heaven, with a little pink flower and a leaf cutting on an angle into the cake adding a nice touch of aesthetic. I casually removed the aesthetics and took a bite. The cream was rich and wholesome, pleasant in the way it coats your mouth, but not in such a way that was overwhelming. I could catch the sponginess of the underlying biscuit and the coffee was \"just\" right, strong enough to wake you up like it was morning again, but not enough to overpower all the other flavors present in the dish. I don't care if I sound like I'm overselling this thing, it was freakin' delicious. I wanted seconds and thirds, my wallet be damned.  The owner was extremely attentive and accommodating to our table. Orders came out in a timely fashion and he had the kind of attitude that made it really easy for my table to engage him in conversation as the last bits of sunlight were going back behind the mountains. Initially, my dad had been wary about going to restaurants that serve food in this style, but I'm very happy with the earnest and welcoming attitude of the owner as he conversed with him. The owner even went out of his way to provide us sample plates of some of his dishes to try out, such as these cuts of seared NY strip that were tender and downright juicy. Throughout the dinner, I felt quite welcome and comfortable thanks in major part to the owner, and for that, I appreciate that he put such a good impression forward that made my dad warm up to this style of eating.  If I had any nitpick about the restaurant overall in this review, it was that my family and I expressed some discomfort over the broken A/C unit, which made our dining experience a bit warmer than we would prefer. This might be problematic for any future diners coming in about a month from this review. However, this was a minor problem at best in early May.  To the owner, thank you for making my graduation dinner such a pleasant experience for both my family, friends, and I. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Please try this place when your here. I beg you.   I'm serious the food here is nothing better than heavenly. The truffled marrow filet is nothing more than 6 star. Ita worth the drive. Please I beg you to try it. Nothing more than heavenly"}
{"text":"Just finished eating dinner here and threw up after I ate their yakisoba. I don't recommend, and I won't be back. They didn't do anything to help either, other than offering me hot water. I basically paid to eat their food to throw it up. The servers did not seem concerned that a customer threw up after eating the restaurant's food, which was honestly upsetting to see.   Update: My boyfriend, who also ate the yakisoba felt like throwing up after we left the restaurant."}
{"text":"We've been regulars here & I don't understand why I haven't left a review! First of all, I love how the chef interacts with the customers. Second, this place is on my top 3 restaurants I have ever eaten at. Each dish is beautifully plated & very flavorful! My favorite is the baby octopus :) o! & get the banana harumaki"}
{"text":"Pretty good food everything we ate was tastey (gyoza, rock shrimp-has a little kick real good tho, and fried rice!!"}
{"text":"Food was exceptional! Price point is little high considering it's not a strip restaurant. Personally I didn't mind it. I was able to eat top notch food without going onto the strip. My suggestions are a must order - truffle bone marrow and rock shrimp. Order a beer, have a little sake and get those two dishes, you'll be in for a treat! Oh and by the way, the scallops are some of the best I've tasted. If you're a Nobu fan, you will certainly appreciate this place. I suggest their happy hour if you're a little light in the wallet."}
{"text":"Uni Chawamushi!...  Nigerian Prawns with Yuzu Cilantro!...  Bone Marrow with Truffle Butter!...  Japaneiro Asian Infusion Restaurant is what you get when a couple of Chefs at Nobu (Kevin & Michael) decide to open up their own place. The menu is saturated with high quality products that are out of the price range of your typical Southwest Las Vegas neighborhood restaurant, but less than the \"Strip-prices\" where these products are so often found. As expected, there are several items similar to Nobu dishes on the menu.  It is also evident that Kevin & Michael have a fondness for Uni, Truffle Butter, & Yuzu, as these options come up a lot between the menu and the Board Specials.  A great intro can be had during Happy Hour from 4pm-6pm (M-F) and again from 10pm-12am (M-F). My favorites from the Happy Hour menu are the Sea Bass & Black Cod Butter Lettuce Wraps. You can also find Tuna, Salmon & Beef Tacos, the same Tuna & Salmon prepared on a thin slice of Lotus Root, flavorful Chicken Kushiyaki, quality Gyoza with Angus Beef, and a couple other items to round out the Happy Hour menu.  One of the highlights of Japaneiro is the Specials Board. We came in twice in two different weeks, and saw several interesting items...wished we had come in with friends to taste more! The Uni Chawamushi was amazing and the Nigerian Prawns were a sight to see! We ordered the later with Truffle Butter that was aromatically spectacular! ...also spotted Soft-Shell Crab and Whole Maine Lobster on the Board in addition to other attention-grabbing items.  The interior is just as awkward as it was when it was Volcano Grill. That's a shame considering you are likely to spend ~ $50 per person...and that's a bit unique in this neighborhood. Even more than other places, Japaneiro will live or die on their food alone. I am certainly glad to have this type of an option in Southwest Las Vegas and hope it does well enough to stay open. I'd love to stop in every couple months.  Come in for unique food options! Come in for good eats! Come in for high quality proteins! Come in if you love uni!...pretty sure they'll put it on anything for you and it's already an option for 1/3 of the menu! Don't come in for a romantic setting... Dessert?...well. let's say, it's not their forte."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time about a year ago with my husband. We must have not ordered the right thing because the first visit didn't leave a lasting impression. This time around I ordered the NY Strip and it was amazing! Definitely recommend trying that dish along with the milk tea ice cream and banana dessert."}
{"text":"Japaneiro Asian fusion tonight for dinner. The happy hour is absolutely amazing. Just what a night owl like me needs from 10 -2. Everything I tried was delicious. the salmon taco with wasabi aioli is divine. I could have eaten 10 for the $1.50 price tag, will try the tuna & beef next time. Also got the Gyoza with angus beef thanks to the chef's recommendation! I heard he use to work at Nobu & he's super friendly. Last but certainly not least is the Rock Shrimp, they rock!!! Overall 10/10 experience. Will definitely be back to try everything on their happy hour. The waitress was also super cute & friendly."}
{"text":"First, let me get to why it is one star short of perfect.... There were only my husband and I and another couple dining at the restaurant, and the food still took FOREVER!! Imagine if all the tables were filled??   Thanks to the chef for our complimentary truffle edamame. He probably heard us say how hungry we were because he knew it'd take a long time. I would have ordered appetizers, but we really didn't know it would take so long for our dishes to be done. The truffle edamame were really good. Better than your average.   My hubs and I shared the 24oz bone in ribeye with 7 special salts and a yuzu truffle dip. We asked for Medium, but it came to use Medium rare. We didn't complain because omg we were starving and it took a long time for this to get to us. The flavor of the beef was ok. For a $65 steak, I usually expect flavor without having to use sauces, dips (or 7 salts). It was good with the dip and salts though.  We also shared a Nigerian Prawn w/ some kind of truffle flavor. This cost $26. That was pretty good. We each also got our own bowls of the Japaneiro Special fried rice $6/bowl. That was really, really good. Staff and service was great despite the wait. We'll be returning for more."}
{"text":"My siblings and I wanted to find some places we haven't tried yet for dinner last night and was looking on the Internet for unique places in Vegas we can try. I ran across pictures of Japaneiro on Instagram and was sold.   For 70% of restaurants in today's age and our culture of today who love taking pictures of everything we eat, most pictures interpret the flavor of the picture they represent. THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL AT JAPANEIRO. Everything we had a Japaneiro seemed to have a burst of great flavor and new surprises as you kept eating.   My favorite of the appetizers was the Tuna lotus wraps, which I highly recommend if you're going to Japaneiro. I'm not usually a black cod fan but the way it was prepared last night had me thinking why I don't eat black cod more. The angus beef gyoza was made from scratch in house had us wanting more of them ! But we resisted because we needed to save room for the main courses. We had the Australian lamb chops, truffle marrow filet and the NY strip foie gras. Each of the main dishes we had came highly recommended by our server Lolo, I can't really describe the dishes in no other way than to just let the pictures speak for themselves (how ironic since I started this review with a rant on pictures not matching taste and flavor) she was very knowledgeable of the menu and guided us through the menu really well like a good server should.   Throughout the meal we were asking Lolo if chef Chong had any plans for opening up a new location or moving his establishment closer to toward the Henderson/Green Valley area so we wouldn't have to drive so far anymore for his incredible dishes. We did not get a definitive answer but the thought of them thinking about it will have us praying that they do open a new establishment. We will definitely be back for more ! Thanks to Lolo and Chef Chong's dishes"}
{"text":"So grateful to have such a great spot in the neighborhood!  Every dish was brilliantly executed and the chefs made sure to make us feel welcomed and taken care of. Our server, Sarah, was amazing as well! Great knowledge and service :) Thank you, Japaneiro!  See you again soon."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I was really excited to try this place. During lunch, it's quiet and slow. The waitress was very attentive and suggested some great items to try. As she brought out each dish, she described the plate.   Tapas style foods, great for sharing. If you are looking for a heavy huge meal, this is not the place. We tried the scallop with uni off the specials menu. It was perfectly paired and perfectly cooked. The tuna tacos were small but packed great flavor. Chilean bass butter lettuce wraps were good but not overly impressive.   Over all the restaurant is worth a try and has great food. I will be back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"The food here was outstanding!! Nobu quality, affordable pricing.  Must try the desserts!!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"We found this place thanks to Yelp on a visit to Vegas a few weeks ago.  We went later in the day and I thought we were lost in the boonies with all the road construction and what looked like abandoned strip malls.  Turned into a small center with a Bruddahs restaurant facing the street.  On entering it looks like a hallway of a restaurant, albeit a warm, cozy, well designed hallway.  I ordered an iced tea and got what looked like cloudy water.  Turns out it was rice tea.  If you know the sweet rice tea at the end of Korean meals, that's what this is minus the sugar, cinnamon and actual bits of rice floating in it.  Taste was not bad at all, just not what I expected.  Service was fast, informative and friendly.  I was tempted to try some of the more exotic (read: expensive) specials, but we just got to Vegas and I didn't hit Megabucks yet.  So we ordered the rock shrimp to start and I got the chawanmushi and Japaniero Special Yakisoba Udon.  The rock shrimp was outstanding!  Reminded me of honey walnut shrimp at Chinese restaurants, but this was so succulent with a little crunch.  Taste was perfect.  I could eat a heaping plate by myself.  The chawanmushi came out with dried seaweed sprinkles on the top.  The sprinkles were like concentrated ocean and a little distracting, but the chawanmushi itself was beautiful.  So creamy and flavorful and seemed to melt on the tongue.  The Yakisoba udon was the best Yakisoba I've ever had.  Even the squash blossom pur√©e, which I thought was odd, worked well.  A couple friends got the regular noodles, but I felt the udon noodles really complemented the flavors more and gave a better chew to the dish.  I savored the last few bites.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 was that it was a little pricey for the portions.  But that's it.  Everything else was wonderful.  It was an unexpected gem on our first night in Vegas and worth the drive from the Strip.  I will definitely make an effort to go back next time."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in after Kyara was booked up.  We were very surprised that such a high quality Japanese restaurant would be in our neighborhood! The ambience is not very good (relative to the quality of food and prices), very casual environment, but you can't eat a tablecloth! And, let's be clear, the prices are a bit steep The food itself was wonderful! My wife had the seafood udon (not on the menu, but the server suggested it after speaking to my wife). It has a miso soup base with plenty of shrimp, sea bass, scallops. I had the steak and foie gras which was simply fabulous! The foie gras was as good as most any you get in France! We generally don't get the appetizers and desserts that so many others like to get. The Asahi draft beer was cold and delicious, though! At those prices, it'll be a special occasion kind of place, but I hope we have a lot of special occasions"}
{"text":"I ate here on Valentines day with my husband. Luckily we are able to make a reservation on Yelp and was seated immediately. Very friendly staff and AMAZING food. The items on the menu are a bit pricey, I spent over $70 and my husband was still hungry.   The item you should definiately get are the salmon tacos! It was so good I had to order it 3 times."}
{"text":"It's so good. The chef is amazing! He trained in the renowned restaurant Nobu and every bite is like tasting heaven. Super duper good quality food for an affordable price. The host is super nice and creates a comfortable environment to enjoy food in!!"}
{"text":"Love. Love even more after our 3-4 hour delay from SF!  Their foie gras and fruit pairings were delicious!  Seriously.. Delicious.  Will come back!"}
{"text":"Husband and I went there for lunch and sampled their happy hour menu. Everything we've ordered was wonderful and delicious. We've returned another day for dinner and I was disappointed on a few dishes that I've ordered. The food was good but a little too heavy and rich for Japanese Fusion. I wish they have fresh sashimi and a few fusion sushi rolls that are bursting with refreshing flavors. Overall the food was good."}
{"text":"We tried several dishes. Really enjoyed the tuna tacos, the truffle edamame, bone marrow (which was excellent), and the rock shrimp. Next we tried the sizzling beef dish which comes out smoking and sizzling. Really enjoyed everything. The food is imaginative, well presented, and service was great. It's a local joint so get out to support it."}
{"text":"Late on my review, but I went a few weeks ago and was very pleased.  Our server was really nice and informative.  It was a weekend and they were not nearly as busy as I would have expected.  The Alaskan cod was very good. The texture and flavor were on point.  The presentation for all food was lovely.  The server was very accommodating.  I wanted to try a dish however did not want uni on it so she offered to order it with only half the uni so that I could try it.  It was delicious.  I wish I could remember more of the names but the sashimi tacos were all very flavorful.  I liked the tuna the most.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here to celebrate my bday expensive kind of dinner and we loved it here.  We tried what was on the board specials and just kept ordering. My husband couldn't get enough of it that he was still talking about the what we ate the very next day and the next.  He also wants to go back to celebrate his bday there in October. Wow!"}
{"text":"The food is EXCELLENT. It seems a higher quality than other restaurants that serve Japanese style food and the staff is very polite. The atmosphere is romantic and the restaurant is upscale."}
{"text":"With the craving for a real good beef, here I dropped by Japaneiro to check out how it gets such high rating being a new restaurant in town. It is a simple decorated restaurant in a hidden part of town, but it was worth the trip as I was fairly impressed by their dishes!   They have a good variety from affordable snacks to exotic upscale dining experience. I started with some tacos, Rock Shrimp(Must have!), black cod Butter Lettuce Wrap(my fav!), then I ordered the NY Strip as my main course. In a small humbled restaurant like this, I wasn't expecting a beautifully presented dish as if I'm dining on the strip. Every dishes was described in details by the waitress. The chef's passion and dedication for top notch food were well presented by the food itself. I was very satisfied, indeed.   Highly recommended and don't forget to check out the SPECIFIC BOARD(off menu), be ready to try out some baby octopus, Escargot, Foie Gras, TRUFFLE BONE MARROW(TheBOMB)! If you are a seafood person, don't fret none, cz they have it all! NIGERIAN PRAWN, Salmon Belly Ceviche, and Uni!! They have Santa Barbara Uni, Catalina Uni, to Japanese Uni is the best!    Whenever your up for a quick and simple meal but delicious? Go for their happy hour menu! It's the HIT!  In the whole, this place is different, Chef with immense Passion and reasonable prices! No other place like this in town so far! Definitely don't miss out!! Get your stomach ready for some FOOD ADVENTURE    This is my 2 cents for the restaurant and the food. To wrap things up, let the food speak for itself upon your visit"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and food was phenomenal! Everything was presented so artfully and beautiful, and tasted even better! We ordered the wagu, which came with several dipping seasonings, and it melted in our mouths! As soon as they get their liquor license, this place will be my favorite!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic.  There is not anything I tried, that I didn't like.   Fresh, and top quality ingredients.  I recommend to everybody to try something different and new."}
{"text":"Thank you fellow yelpers for guiding us to this hidden gem. It's in a shopping center that has a lot of vacancies which can put you off at first, but once you step inside and are greeted by the kind staff you'll know you found something special and delicious. Great customer service. Happy hour menu is great. Love all the tacos (salmon and beef were my favorite but tuna was great too) the green tea creme  br√ªl√©e is great for dessert. We also had Gyoza, rock shrimp, and salmon lotus chip. High quality, fresh fish. They also have some great main entree options for dinner that look so good. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Following one of my favorite Yelpers review (shout out to Philly T!)  I stepped in for a quick bite the day we had a sitter for the evening.  Starved from luxurious cuisine for about a month I could not have been more excited to find Japaneiro to be the perfect amount of silver spoon in a strip mall.  The chefs are as magical as unicorns.  To find this caliber of skill in each plate offered at the most nominal of ranges is evident that the owners are either well trained chefs who love what they do, or are quite too humble for their own good.    Japanese-French fusion has been happening for quite some time.  Japaneiro takes this genre of cuisine much more seriously.  Sure one could state that the location isn't quite Las Vegas Blvd.  Then again if you are that type of person, you still are only 7 or so miles away if you need something fancy to look at.  I based this review mainly on the dishes served.  Also upon entrance we were greeted warmly by the staff and chef was also very welcoming throughout.  There is not a lot of seating by normal standards.  Which just makes things more intimate.  \"The Board\" was our menu that day.  We started with the Bone Marrow with Truffle Butter & wonton chips.  This was a most filling and decadent bone.  It could not have been more rich or warming for the season.  I found the broiled gelatinous goodness to be expertly timed and not losing much of it's substance or flavor as I've tried elsewhere.  The truffle flavor incorporates subtly with the entire entree and the light crisp of the wonton was a perfect binder.  5/5  Seared Scallops with Uni.  How could I explain this differently from the other times I have tried this combination?  Well, this time it was done right.  Large sweet snappy scallop subdued and surrendering oceanic sweet uni flavor deeper into each bite.  The warmth of the slightly seared scallop combined with a cool seaweed salad spoonful underneath it all.  Okay.  That basically explains it.  Next time I'm ordering 4 of these to myself.  5/5  Uni Chawamushi with Ikura.  A new adventure for me!  Strange are the ways that the honorable sea urchin has been mixed into cuisine.  This was certainly a change of pace for my Uni addiction.  Dig into the custard and divulge some uni and a few pops of roe on to your spoon.  The softness of custard gives uni a place to mingle and the salty Ikura contrasts the situation.  I need to study this Chawamushi dish further before I can give a premature rating.  I do know I love uni and ikura thats for sure!  Now for the Foie Gras.  I wish I could remember what exactly was in those sauces!  I really do because I am known to keep Foie stocked in my house and every month or so I have a break from my seafood diet and sear up a slice.  I realize that there is no way I could possibly replicate Japaneiro's version, yet still.  A thick sauce of a very umami tart miso-like consistency was cooked on top and a light and bright sauce was set aside that had a hint of acidity.  Appropriate.  5/5  Ny Steak with mustard and truffle sauce.  Ny is a perfect cut for medium rare.  I don't have beef very often but I had to try this.  Tender pre cut and organised beautifully.  Take a slice and dab onto the mustard then dip it into the truffle buttered sauce and take a bite.  Devoured this lovely slab of beef in record time.  5/5  Don't be put off by what surrounds the table.  Take a bite and close your eyes.  These plates hold exquisite quality and the value is the only thing at a premium.  You see my star rating.  I will be watching Japaneiro very closely."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Our server, Sarah, was amazing! She knew everything there is to know about the menu! If you aren't familiar with Japanese/French fusion cuisine then ask for Sarah. You cannot come here without ordering the bone marrow filet! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tasty Food, Great Price Point, Very Friendly Staff"}
{"text":"This was our second time coming to this restaurant and both times it was almost completely empty.   The food quality is 10/10. We ordered the sea bass, scallop teramoto, chicken and beef fried rice, truffle edamame, and the chawamushi. They were all packed with flavor and quality that made us melt. My favorite was the scallop teramoto and the chawamushi. It's hard to find quality chawamushi and this place has the best I've had in the Vegas. Definitely want to try the uni chawamushi next time.   The service was nothing spectacular. Our server just took our order and brought us our food. Left us alone for most of the time, which isn't a bad thing.   I wonder why they didn't have a lot of customers. Maybe it was the time of day we went or the location. It's located in a small complex with about one other store open nearby. There was a pretty decent sized parking lot with only a few cars parked. So I guess there's never a problem with parking.   The only complaint I would have, is that the beef in the fried rice was hard and was not seasoned. So that was a bummer. But even though the food portions were pretty small, it was able to fill us up pretty quickly."}
{"text":"A sure fire disappointment. We came here on a Friday evening for dinner thanks to the great yelp reviews and I must say, it was a disappointment. I liked the fact that you can bring your own booze/liquor but I realized that was the case due to the fact that they don't have a liquor license as yet. The restaurant is HOT. I'm not sure if it's because of the open kitchen or because they don't have air conditioning, but dress light!   Let's start out with our server. He seemed really knowledgable about the items served at the restaurant. But when I asked him for suggestions, he advised me to look away from the menu and into their specials board. He said himself that people don't come in and order off the menu. They come in for what they have on their specials board. So right off the bat, I didn't like the fact that he essentially said nothing on the menu was great and I should stick with specials. Either way, there were some staples on the menu that sounded like must haves. Rock shrimp tempura, tacos, yakisoba, salmon/tuna chips. Unfortunately, I felt everything was just eh.   Rock shrimp-bland. Needed sriracha to actually have some flavor.  Tacos-very bland. I was almost embarrassed asking for soy sauce. But it wasn't just me, my whole table asked me to pass some down.  Yakisoba-Decent. But on the sweeter side. The flavor wasn't something I'd come back for.  Salmon/Tuna chips-Fishy and missing basic seasoning.   We all left full, and unlike others, I didn't think the prices were unreasonable. I think they were fair. But I just feel that this restaurant has so much potential, but was a big let down in their fish quality, flavors, and overall experience.   On a side note, my friends really enjoyed the bone marrow. But it's not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"This was my second visit and it was exceptional. I came in around 2ish am and thought for sure they would be closed but luckily they weren't and were very friendly and welcoming. I came for the bone marrow which I loved the previous time and it awesome. I had the scallops in ponzu sauce and the truffle edamame. I almost want to revisit before I leave!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed a nice dinner for 3 at this restaurant. We ate for under $75 for 3 people and we're satisfied. The food is good and presented well. Some items may need a touch more salt, but the overall experience will have me coming back again. I especially am hapoy that foie gras is available down the street from home when I'm craving it"}
{"text":"Pretty presentations and tasty food but barely any of it. Was shocked at how tiny the portions were. 7oz of NY Strip came out looking like 2, MAYBE 3 oz. Staff was nice and eager, but not easy to understand, so we ordered things we thought were included with the meal only to get the bill and find out they were all add ons...and we didn't even get the side that was \"supposed to be\" included. Menu  is very brief and doesn't explain what is what. Still cant believe how much we paid for such a small amount of food. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"After passing by a few times, I finally took the time to check this place out and I must say I'm so glad I did. It is located in the same weird area as Braddah's on Warms Springs and Tenaya. It is LITERALLY a hidden gem.   Angus Beef Gyoza: This is one great tasting dish! The beef was really flavorful that every bite made me went, \"Hmmm.\" It is easy to overcook beef specially if you try to fry it but the chef cooked it so perfectly. My only concern was since the beef was a little fatty, it was a little bit oily/greasy. Still it was very good.  Rock Shrimp: We ordered this as an appetizer. It reminded me of the \"Bang Bang\" shrimp from Bonefish but instead of the sweet spicy sauce, it was in a Yuzu sauce that was tangy and spicy. Delicious! I fell in love with every bite.   Chilean Sea Bass: This dish was listed under the Chef's Specialty part of the menu. It came with a cilantro sauce that paired perfectly with the fish. It was pan-fried to perfection giving it that crispy bite. Highly recommended.   Scottish Salmon: This dish was also from the Chef's Specialty menu. The salmon was pan-fried to your preference. I always get mine medium/medium well. Like a perfect steak, do not get your fish well done. It really is a waste. The flavor was spot on good. It tasted like teriyaki with a hint of yuzu. It came with a house salad and the sauce they used for that you can dip your fish in to give it that extra ump.   Yuzu Coconut Mochi with Genmai Cha Ice Cream: What better way to end a perfect dinner but with a perfect dessert. The mochi was the best one I've tasted so far. It is not frozen so it was soft and chewy. The ice cream totally hit the spot for me. I love Genmai Cha as a tea but for it to an ice cream flavor, it was heaven on earth.   The chef's cooking skills are phenomenal. Every dish that came out that that kitchen was a work of art. Next time I come here, I will try and catch their happy hour. I heard a lot of good things about it. A good way to sample a lot of the items on their menu."}
{"text":"Exquisite Nobu inspired Chef has awaken me with such amazingly delicious creations of food art that will have me returning every week!"}
{"text":"For lack of better words, Japaneiro is a hidden gem.   I've been here 4 times since they've opened and have never had a bad experience. From the food to the staff, you're time here will be memorable to say the least.   The eclectic cuisine is beautifully complimented by fast and friendly service. The Chef is social and has no problem stepping out of the kitchen to recommend dishes and such.  I recommend checking out the specials on the black board upon entry, currently the Salmon Ceviche is my go to alone with BOTH Butter Lettuce Wraps. (Black cod & Chillean Seabass) For the munchkins, my 3 and 4 year old had no issues finding something to enjoy... Note that I consider them adventurous eaters! Like mama!"}
{"text":"The pictures speak for themselves. Place was great and the service was on point. Extremely helpful and friendly staff with a foie gras and steak heavy menu."}
{"text":"Delightful surprise. I love japanese and french cuisine independently. This fusion for a foodie, tickled my fancy - I love to try new cuisine. japa√±eiro is unique and will come back to try the rest of the menu and chef's specials. Menu  includes Foie gras, bone marrow, surf & turf, and Chilean sea bass for example. Dishes start at $4-$6 starters to $15-$41 chef specials. Portions mirror fine dining or tapas. The dishes I had fulfilled me just right.   I am a pescatarian and from Hawaii ... enjoyed the salmon tacos, lotus chip ahi (tuna), and rock shrimp. The Chawanmushi with Uni and salmon roe was a chef's special and something I haven't had before. Interesting fusion of miso and my fave ingredients on their own (uni, salmon roe) in porridge form. Not for every palette. It was good but not something to add to my must have list. Perhaps some sriracha and warm sake would have changed my mind lol  Wish they had more vegetarian selections, however, as I look for these options every where I eat. No tofu?  My dates had the fried rice, udon special, and black cod. Delicious.   I spent $30. About $85 for a party of 3. Look out for specials on the blackboard that's not on the menu.  They are close to the Arroyo shopping center on Warm Springs off of Rainbow. The restaurant is fairly new to the southern location- nice to see a restaurant like this in my neighborhood.   4 stars if they had drinks and vegetarian options. But They will have a selection of drinks soon (beer, wine, sake).  Water glasses I'd suggest that they use taller ones.  Ambience:  The playlist playing I feel should be toned down by volume and the sappy Disney related selections.  Some chill, acoustic sounds preferably for example.  We were sitting right under the flatscreen tv and it was fairly loud."}
{"text":"We came in late, like 1am, because we had a craving for sushi but couldn't find anything open. This place hit the spot, great food and our server had good suggestions. Try the salmon ceviche !"}
{"text":"Here for Valentine's Day with the wifey. Awesome atmosphere and service.  We started with Rock Shrimp and the Gyoza (Angus beef with Kabanyaki glaze). For the main course; the Chilean Sea Bass and Japaniero Yakisoba noodles (chicken, beef and shrimp.) Quality food and service from Lolo (our server.)"}
{"text":"This place is the BOOOOOOMB!!! Rock shrimp rocks! Everything is ahhh-maaay-ziiing! Our new favorite place."}
{"text":"great fusion taste.   there was a funky smell in the dining area. not sure if that's there all the time.  the butter lettuce black cod was delicious.  the waitress was super nice."}
{"text":"Two of us decided to share some of the smaller plates. We ordered: 1 Tuna Tacos (1 order = 2 tacos) 1 Salmon Tacos 1 Chawamushi 1 Salad w/sesame dressing and tobiko flakes 1 House fried rice 1 Truffle Bone Marrow  Everything was really good. We didn't order any entrees, which were def on the more expensive side. Everything we ordered above was very reasonably priced and made for a great meal.   We both agreed that the Tuna taco was better then the Salmon. The flavors in the tuna taco were nice and simple. The salmon had too many things going on and the flavors kind of all got lost.   The Salad was better then I was expecting it to be. The dressing was great, not too heavily dressed and the tobiko flakes were a nice texture.   My favorite item of the night, the Chawamushi! We didn't get it with the roe and uni, as I wasn't sure if my dining partner was adventurous enough to appreciate. I didn't regret the plain Chawamushi at all! It was fantastic. I've been craving this since last eating it here.  And very cheap!   I wasn't a huge fan of the Fried Rice as my dining partner described it as greasy, but she liked that. I didn't so much. But also another cheap dish.   Truffle Bone Marrow was damn good. Although not sure I would order again, but happy I tried it here.   By making a meal of the small plates we had a great dining experience at a reasonable price. I would definitely go back and eat this way again and try some of the other small plates..."}
{"text":"Just checked this place  out tonight, based on a recommendation  from a patient.  The menu was amazing! ! Everything from A5 Wagyu beef from Japan, to Nigerian  Shrimp longer than a chopstick! !!.  Kevin, the owner was most gracious.   Made a special dish of uni with Japanese  noodles which was great!   Also tried a few things  on the happy hour  menu.  The fried shrimp  appetizer for $ 4.50 was very generous  and tasty.  The black cod lettuce wrap was amazing.   Could  have eaten  those  puppies  all night  long.  Kevin was nice enough  to let  me sample  some high end Saki's.  The waitress  Sara was delightful.   Will be back soon."}
{"text":"The wife and I really enjoyed this place. We decided to eat outside because a line busted and smelled like sulfur but that's out of the owners control and I'm sure it'll be fixed soon. What I really love about this restaurant is the chef's creativity really shines throughout the entire menu and the menu is built to enable variety. The menu is truly unique because the flavors the chef built on each entree and appetizer aren't seen anywhere around here. One thing I truly support is a unique menu because it shows a quality product.   We had... Oyster: super fresh and amazing! Rock shrimp: wow! Great mix of flavors Gyoza: quality meat Cod butter lettuce wraps: neat presentation and unique preparation Tuna taro chips: zesty and refreshing Beef taco: unique shell and a hint of wasabi Appetizer bone marrow: wow! The appetizer size was freaking huge! Rich and a neat take on a rare menu item Tobanyaki Filet mignon: good flavor and very delicate meat.  Banana Harumaki with milk ice cream: great flare.   Please go here to support an amazing and creative menu. We need more places like this."}
{"text":"Decided to got out for a late evening snack.   Had seen the reviews of Japaneiro and just had to give it a try.  They are located off Warm Sprogs in a half empty min mall.   The mini mall is new and I would assume new residents will be filling it up by the summer.   One thing that stood out was the smell of sewage which is a concern.  Of they already have a drainage problem and the mini mall is half full what will happen when it is full.      Our server was very good and knew the menu like the back of her hand.  She explained the specials and other items in perfect detail.   I am impressed when they truly know the menu and you can tell they tried the items they are discussing.      We had the chicken and beef kushi which was on the dry side and very bland tasting.  The tacos my daughter had were OK but nothing special.  The Black Angus Gyoza was a real let down.  There was no real flavor to the inside and the meat was overcooked and there were pieces of hard grizzle in everyone of the Gyoza.  I would not order this again.  The tuna lotus chips were good and everyone enjoyed them.  The fish was fresh tasting and they were lightly spiced to enhance the flavor.  We finished off with a shared dessert of fried bananas with the tea ice cream.  This was well prepared and delicious.        As  the items we ordered were more misses than hits I don't think I will return.  There are so many much better choices in the area."}
{"text":"Japaneiro a hidden jewel in southwest Las Vegas. Delicious evening we had my husband  and I. The combination of flavors you find in this little Asian Fusion spot is surprisingly delicious. We tried the truffle bone marrow and the rock shrimp tempura. The presentation is exquisite congratulations to Chef Kevin..."}
{"text":"I really like this reataurant :) I love uni . This place has real fresh uni from japan! Also they have signiture dish bone marrow fillet with foie gras . Its perfect ! Yammy   I used to come this place twice a week ~  It has also happy hours. I really love their Taco And this place good for dating couples or birthdayparty!"}
{"text":"THE TRUFFLE BONE MARROW & FILET . ** 2017 Yelp 100 Challenge #10** . This is what you literally call a hole in the wall restaurant in the middle of no where.... there are only maybe 6 tables inside & you could see the kitchen the moment you walk in. If you were to picture it empty you would think it was a take out joint. Nice thing is that each table is separated by long tall sticks so it's nice to not bump chairs w/ the person behind you. . The couple of times we went the owner & chef himself took care of us which was nice because he was able to recommend different things on the menu. Then the last time we went there was a waitress that took care of us & she was o so SWEET & quick as possible even though she had a full house & patio. . We ate every single item on the HAPPY HOUR menu  Favorites:  - Rock Shrimp w/ yuzu creme spicy sauce $5.5  - Shrimp Kushi w/ a citrus spicy butter sauce $3.5   - Gyoza 2 pieces home made from certified Angus beef $2.5  - Hokkaido scallop sashimi w/ jalapeno yuzu soy $12.5   Everything else was just OK but our least favorite was the LOTUS chips which were Salmon. Tuna. Scallop & they just shocked us since it said YUZU SPICY MISO but it was just PURE SWEETNESS that overpowered it & we had to force ourselves to eat the FOUR piece that came w/ each order!! O__o it was very hard to eat but we just swallowed & washed it down w/ our beer.  . TRUFFLE BONE MARROW W/FILET $38 (don't quote me on the price I lost my receipt picture) this was an AMAZING dish w/ the yuzu sesame sauce that came on the side to dip it with!!!!!! I just crave that DERICIOUSNESS & we devoured & sucked in the bone like a cave woman. The FILET was a perfect medium too!!  Banana harumaki w/ hojicha ice cream was the best out of all the desserts!! $10.00 LOVE the hojicha ice cream"}
{"text":"There are some great Japanese restaurants in this city...but nothing can match the quality, service and value of Japaneiro!  High end strip food at locals prices!  Arrived early and got to take advantage of happy hour prices, which was a bonus.  As others have stated, truffle marrow is ridiculously good...one of the best things I've ever eaten.   Super rich, super flavorful, with wonton chips on the side.   Uni was sweet and fresh...I prefer the Japanese one to the one from Catalina Island, but both are delicious.  Black cod lettuce wraps were tasty, with a little pastry dough for texture.  Chicken kushi was fantastic.  Everything was spot on.    No liquor license yet, but you can bring your own..  server said they're in process and should have it soon.  A little bit of sake would have been the perfect compliment to my meal...looking forward to when I'm able to partake.  If you want an incredible meal without breaking the bank, make sure to put Japaneiro on your list!  One of the best meals I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice atmosphere, and good service, open late! The baby octopus was too chewy but everything else was excellent. We were the only customers on a Wednesday night at 10."}
{"text":"So far so good. Only has take out but if the Angus Gyozas are any indication of their full service menu can't wait to dine in!"}
{"text":"I don't know how they can get 4.5 star. We ordered salmon and tuna taco. The fish were smell and old, especially salmon. The place is so tiny. The server was less attention. The foods were expensive."}
{"text":"Came in the restaurant, got sat right away. Took about 10 minutes to get greeted by our server. They didn't have the bottle of wine we ordered so settled for something else. Server took our appetizer order. We decided on baby squid, salmon tacos, beef kushiyakis and bone marrow( complimentary w bottle wine). Took about 40 minutes for the appetizers to come out. First out, salmon tacos. It was ok. It's a cold dish.. I don't understand why it took 40 mins for it. Next was baby squid. The squid were delicious. I asked the server about the marrow and she forgot to put it in.. great! So ordered our entrees...Ny strip w foie gras and 24 dry age rib eye. Waited, waited, waited and waited.. marrow comes and It tasted good. Still waiting on kushiyakis. Then we asked to cancel our steaks since we been in the restaurant for almost 2 hours. Chef told server it's already on the grill. They rushed our steaks and when it came out. While presentation looked good. Steaks were raw and cold. And they also never got our kushiyakis out. Returned them and asked for the check. Btw, steaks didn't taste \"prime \" nor \"aged\". Chef apologized for the apps coming out late but didn't come out for the entrees. Self explanatory. Don't go here when they have more than 2 tables"}
{"text":"I came here based on the reviews on Yelp . The service is great, friendly and attentive. That's why I give it 2 stars... I came here on sat night , and the place is empty, but the whole restaurant has funky smell like sewage, the combination of that smell and food smell stick on my clothes the whole night . They need to upgrade the ventilation system. Talking about food, I think it's over rated, they have some different dishes but the portion is very little , pricing is confusing on the chalk board and kinda expensive, I spent $180 for dinner of 2, we ordered some appetizers, and lamp chops, with that price I thought it should be in a high end restaurant not in the old stinky small restaurant like this .  It's good to try this place because I don't have to think about it anymore , and I don't see myself coming back"}

{"text":"Japaneiro is very interesting for a late night stop for Japanese. The menu didn't really have your typical tuna or California roll. Instead they had salmon lettuce wraps, lotus chips, and skewers. More like a Japanese tapas place than sushi destination. The food was very tasty but not what I expected. Prices are very good (esp during happy hour beginning at 11pm). Overall I found it a very fine difference from the typical sushi spot. Staff was awesome and restaurant was very clean. Definitely worth a try if in the area."}
{"text":"You know what you did....you're the worst chef ever! This guy is a con artist,,, I asked him about the fish not being fresh and having a foul smell, he got mad and kicked me out of his dump place, no wonder no one was there eating, maybe bcoz it's not fresh. Don't get mad chef, it's a valid question, you didn't have to answer but don't disrespect your customers! Karma will come back'"}

{"text":"Heard about Japaneiro Asian Fusion from my sister.  We try it out tonight. The experience was nothing short of Fantastic.  From the food to the service.

We are already looking forward to our return."}

The truffle Filet which is bone marrow coupled with Filet Mignon is the perfect balance between the rich flavor of the marrow and the lean yet super tender filet. It's truly amazing second only to the Japanese A5+ Wagyu which is so amazing that I'm at a loss for words. Just trust me and try it! Service from the owner /chef Kevin as well as from Lola and Jeffrey is exceptional. They all are very attentive and friendly. High end Strip quality located in an unassuming location. EAT LIFE my friends."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with my wife and a handful of good friends. We were all curious to see how they transformed the former Volcano Grille into Japaneiro. The decor was really cool. The place had the same look it did before, but very much upgraded. Japaneiro seemed to have put a lot of thought into the added design. It turned out great! The atmosphere was nice for a date and fun for a group of friends. Though the decor was nice, the food is why I will be coming back. From their Jidori chicken to their certified Angus Bone in Ribeye, there is definitely quality there. Oh, and let's not forget their Chilean sea bass! That was my favorite, I loved the clean flavor of the fish and the subtle flavor of the sauce that accompanied the fish. Quality seems to be the passion of this place. If that's something you care about, this place is definitely worth checking out. An easy 5 stars."}
{"text":"Visited during lunch, restaurant didn't open until noon but looks like they changed hours now and only open for dinner.  They do not carry diet soda which was odd.  Food was ok, but items were pricy even during happy hour.  Luckily my visit was with a meetup with a group of people so we were able to sample multiple dishes.  We tried the yakisoba, chicken & beef skewers, shrimp, and chicken bento.  Service was slightly slow as dishes came out randomly and waitress seemed she was still learning menu, but we were able to get separate checks and left on time."}
{"text":"So amazing. Best happy hour. Place like this deserves a strip location but so glad it's by the house.  Everything is delicious.!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has turned into one of my favorite places for interesting food.  Japanese-French fusion.  I think the chef used to work for one of the hotels on the strip and now he has his very own place here.  I decided to take my fam here and they loved it.    The location is where the old Volcano Grille used to be.  They made a few changes to the interiors, and they added some patio seating.  Tables and chairs were comfortable and inviting.    The server was very friendly.  I wish I could remember her name.  She did a great job explaining the whole menu (and the specials) inside and out.  She explained everything with great enthusiasm!  It almost seemed like she loved working here and was very passionate about the food.    Everything we tried was fantastic.  We had the bone marrow, foie gras over NY steak, shrimp, and the beef toban (I think that's what it's called).  I love foie gras, and I'm really picky with how it's made, and they did a really great job with the flavor.  Great combination to put the foie gras over NY Steak.  The NY Steak was also fantastic!  Juicy, tender, and perfect.    The truffle bone marrow was filled with flavor, but I wish they had bigger servings of it.    We shared all the dishes since it's tapas style, and we left comfortably full.    The deserts were awesome too.  Mango Cheesecake and the Banana Harumaki with milk tea ice cream.      If you're feeling adventurous with your taste buds, this is the perfect place to go."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. A nice tucked in location producing a quaint, intimate setting, restaurant that surely produces an explosion of flavor. I am blown away!   This quality of food is not secondary to even the \"high end\" celebrity chef, restaurants on the strip.   Just stop your search and get to this local hotspot!"}
{"text":"If I could give it 100 stars I would!! Bone marrow fillet was mind blowing! Sea bass was amazing! Rock shrimp appetizer mouth watering! Every dish from appetizers to dessert was the best food I've ever had!! Everyone must try this place, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Food is good . But be ready on your bill it's like almost eating on the strip . Ayce is a lot better or kbbq .. The check say 18% grat. for party of 2 wow ..."}
{"text":"Service was great! Not to fond of the food. I was thinking it would be better than this one place I go to. But thinking that maybe paying a little more than the other place would be great. But I ordered the NY strip steak and thinking i would get a side of rice or veggies to come with it. Not just meat. Don't get me wrong I love meat but maybe a little carbs or veggies would be great. Especially paying $14. and up. So I had to order a side of rice to go with my meal. I also ordered the Jadiro chicken which needed more flavor. Tuna taco it was ok.   It was nice to try this place out. But I think I'll stick to my other resto since it had more flavor and a side with my main dish."}
{"text":"I miss this place, was so busy that I didn't come for a month!!  Finally I try the A5 wagyu, wow, wow wow!!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. Amazzzzzzzzzzing.  Bone marrow, filet, and foie. Whaaaaa!!!   Fish that melts in your mouth with amazing sauce that you just wanna slurp after. The uni taste like butter. All the dishes are Super fresh, so elegant. Well done chef  Yummmmmmmm"}
{"text":"I work well past 10pm some nights & want something quality & fresh to eat after long days. I just happened into this restaurant because of their late night hours & I can't say enough! Everything is fresh & beyond well prepared. I ordered a little of everything - Uni, Chilean sea bass, Kobe gyoza, rock shrimp, jidori chicken, & plenty more. I'll definitely be back! It's quality enough to really be appreciated & casual enough to be able to relax in the atmosphere. The staff takes such care in everything they do. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We found this place by chance.. couldn't decide on what we wanted so we picked a random number. So happy with our pick! Owner/exec. Chef is really friendly and personable! The food was amazing! The gyoza were unlike anything we've ever had before! I think we both could have had 4 more! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a 4.5, but unfortunately Yelp won't let me. This place is really close to a perfect little spot, but there's just little bits that could be better.  This hidden gem is parked away on a small street in a corner plaza. Even though the rave reviews and large sign show off the restaurant there is never a wait time. The restaurant itself though is quite small with limited seating.  Japaneiro primarily focuses on French and Japanese food, however most of their items do fall under the Japanese category. They have a variety of options with both a daily menu and a set one.  The Japanese options are very thorough, with seasonal fish, selections of sashimi, even tobanyaki. Meanwhile their French fusion is a little more limited (Yes they have escargot).  I have been here multiple times and have tried most of their menu. While the flavors they capture are excellent, the price will add up quickly on you. The unagi and the New York Tobanyaki are two of the main courses I preferred with Rock shrimp probably being the best appetizer. If you enjoy bone marrow, they also offer it.  While not the best Japanese tapas in town, they are one of the best places for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Best spot in town. Kevin is the owner/chef and is very friendly. I eat here with my friends and family a few times a week. You must try it!!"}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour on a Friday night. Their happy hour is from 12am to 2am and includes discounted appetizers and drink specials. One of their specials was receive a complimentary bone marrow dish with the purchase of a bottle of wine. Great deal! Their chicken skewers were about $2 per skewer and were so tender and flavorful. The foie gras was about $20 and the presentation was lovely. It was served with tiny fruit that was meant to intensify the flavor of the foie gras. Its a great nearby spot to go to if you live in the southwest area."}
{"text":"Solid place. They just opened so they don't have a liquor license yet, but the food creations are pretty cool and really tasty. I'd definitely come back"}
{"text":"Great little tapas place! If you are looking for sushi, then this place isn't for you. They have French and Japanese food which is great. We had the honor to meet the executive chef/owner of the place. He was really nice and was incredibly passionate about food! He was proud of his ingredients and even showed me some of the escargots. He really made us feel welcomed and the food was good. We ordered almost everything on the menu. The salmon and tuna tacos were great! They were wonton fried skin shells with sashimi pieces in it. The edamame with truffle oil was delicious. Gyozo was okay. Nothing special to be honest. The lettuce wraps with black cod was amazing while the sea bass one was deep fried, so I perferred the black cod over the sea bass. The rock shrimp was great, packed with flavor. I recommend this! The side of mushrooms were just that. Haha but I love mushrooms, so I can't complain. The tuna lotus chips were a unique creation. If I had to choose between the tacos and this, I would go for the tacos, but have to try something once! Both the kushiyaki beef and chicken were great! They are skewers, and very juicy! The japaniero fried rice special was great! It has shrimp, beef and chicken. Mmm... Goes well with the rock shrimp. They are in the process of getting a liquor license, so get ready everyone for amazing, fresh, quality food and alcohol! Woo woo! Did I mention they have happy hour after 10? Whaaaaaa?!?! Nom nom"}
{"text":"What an exquisite dining experience. We came on a Yelp whim suggestion for Valentine's  Day and truly enjoyed 5jiyed every bite.  We will return."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now.  It's close to a relative's home and I would always pass by it everytime I'd come for a visit.  Glad I was finally able to go on my last trip to Vegas a week ago. I tried to make reservations for 5:30p on a Sunday but the next available was 6:00pm according to Yelp.  So imagine my surprise when I got there at 5:45 and the place was virtually empty.  Not sure if it is a restaurant thing or a Yelp thing but they weren't busy at all and could have possibly accommodated an earlier reservation.    From the time I stepped through the doors till I left, the staff was attentive, friendly and pleasant. Our group shared the rock shrimp, beef tobanyaki, shrimp fried rice, shrimp yakiudon, beef yakisoba, lamb chops, tiramisu with green tea ice cream, and banana harumaki with milk tea ice cream.  All excellent.  The meats were tender and tasty. Everything was just so delicious! I can't wait to come here again on my next visit."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try something new by our house. Thank goodness we did!! Such a nice ambiance. Nice staff. The food is beautiful, not expensive and absolutely full of flavor!!! We will absolutely be back!  P.s. The Rock Shrimp was hands down the best shrimp I've ever had. From texture to taste. The best."}
{"text":"This place is okay, but with so many places out there already, it's just so hard not to try the new places, but I have recommended this place. I think the size of the sushi burrito is the right size not an uncut sushi roll."}
{"text":"Delicious food and service. It obvious that there is a great chef who takes care to offer a nice selection of dishes. Most of the dishes themselves are small, designed to feed one person so don't think of anything as family style. All items ordered were great, especially the bone marrow. If you've never had that before, you're missing out - don't miss out!"}
{"text":"I came here to meet a friend.  The server working here was so attentive that she swiftly greeted me, told me my friend had already arrived, and led me to our table, sparing me a whole lot of awkward looking around and potentially saying hi to the wrong person (it's happened). Props to attentiveness!   The rest of our dining experience was kept amazing by her, as she gave us recommendations as to how the Scottish Salmon would taste best, came to check on us regularly, and kept my water refilled at all times. She was extremely knowledgeable about the items on the menu and very enthusiastic about the food, which I appreciate.   I ordered the Scottish Salmon medium-rare. It must have been one of the best salmons I have ever had the joy of eating. The sauce was thick and sweet; the salmon, soft and smooth on the inside and delightfully crispy on the outside. My friend, who had ordered the Jindori Chicken, kept stealing off of my plate. As much as I would love to, I can't blame him. The salmon was just that good. Both of our dishes came with rice.  The prices here are totally reasonable for the high-quality food and service. I will be back."}
{"text":"Totally forgot to write my review for my 2/14 weekend Vegas Trip. I emailed the owner before the weekend, and the owner write me a very detail reply and tell me what is good and what i should try. $198 for 15 courses and it is for 2 people. it is very worth."}
{"text":"I just came back from one of the best meals of my life!  This restaurant is definitely a hidden gem of Las Vegas. This restaurant looks casual and the lounge music was soothing.  We had their Chef's special, a 7 course meal for $150 for two people.  Aside from the high quality and unique taste, I was impressed by the presentation of each dish.   Some of the dishes we had are-  Teramoto Scallop with uni Kumamoto Oyster Uni Foie Gras Nigerian Prawns with Yuzu Cilantro Truffle Bone Marrow & Filet  The waiter is super friendly, and explained what each dishes were and tips on how to eat and savor the dish. He also introduced several Sake and we found them very flavorful.  This location is not the greatest and away from The Strip and the central area. My bf and I loved this great experience and really hope this place never closes."}
{"text":"NOW, THIS IS WHAT I CALL JAPANESE ART CUISINE!  Every dish that we ordered was delicious. We started with The Rock Shrimp and the Salmon Belly as appetizer. Both where ridiculous good. When I first tasted the Salmon Belly, I told my wife \"this would be the new spot\". Once they brought out the The Shrimp Rock, I was astounded by the flavor of it. Everything just keeper getting better and better.   Our main dish for dinner was the Filet Mignon and I have to admit that it was one of the best that I had had.  I will encourage everyone to come and give this place a try. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was EXCELLENT!!I will say the same for the service we received. I will most likely eat there again,but there are a few items I would like them to consider changing. #1- TURN OFF the radio.  The advertisements that blasted through the speakers was a huge distraction. Get a CD with some soft Asian tunes. You have VERY upscale food, the radio cheapens  it. #2- rice should come with all entrees. Owner/Chef came out to greet customers which was nice. Made the experience more personal I will definitely recommend this place to friends. The presentation of all the food was spectacular!!"}
{"text":"Great late night happy hour and some items we loved!   This was my first visit to this small jewel but definitely glad we went outside our usual hangout spots and tried Japaneiro.   Great things- The service. Fantastic service. Our server Rusty was attentive and descriptive about every item down to the ingredients and flavor profile. I was impressed. Even the manager came out and asked us how everything was and welcomed us back.   The atmosphere is casual and intimate. Great food without the \"frills\" kind of experience.  Must try:  TRUFFLE EDAMAME! They ran out last night and only had a handful of it left. (Not surprised, it's delicious!) Rusty still brought the item out but didn't charge us because the half order size. I'm so glad he did because this item is going to keep me coming back to Japaneiro!   Salmon w/ spinach (crispy or saut√©ed in a sweet chili sauce, so yummy)  Fried rice- simple but delicious. Loved the mushroom they add to it.   I would have rated them 5 stars but there were a few flaws. There are a few items on their menu that I've enjoyed at other restaurants a lot more. (The NY strip steak was tough...the rock shrimp was too tangy...and the black cod was so tiny and the flavor was completely lost in the gigantic lettuce wrap).   They're working on getting a liquor license so it's dry for now. BYOB (and a designated driver) ;))  All in all though, maybe it was us going so late at night. I'll def go back w/ a few friends for the items I did love and for the amazing service."}
{"text":"By far the most impressive place we've been to in Vegas. It's hard to have a hit or miss in Vegas, but this joint is a hit or hit higher. 3/3 of us all agree every plate was consistently delicious. Or waiter really brought the experience to the next level (ask for Sara! She's a real foodie with passion) - the chef knows what kind of magic he's working in the kitchen. You don't get this quality meal for such a good price. This was the first time I asked to meet the chef just so I could shake his hand and thank him.   Will definitely come back when we're back in town. Don't be afraid to ask about the menu - they know their stuff."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times just now making review . Have tried basically everything on menu . It's a great small plates Japanese style restaurant . My only complaint is that it is more expensive than the places I would call it's competitors . I highly recommend  any dish in the ever changing chalk menu board . Update: sometimes the smell is a little unbearable"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Ordered numerous items and all very good. If you love bone marrow, you have to get it here, it was delicious"}
{"text":"Considering this is, literally, a minute from my boyfriend's house, I think this place is a goldmine.   To get foie gras and bone marrow right down the street is a dream come true.  No need to fight The Strip traffic for quality Strip food.   The chef is from Nobu and is very hospitable to clients right as you walk in. Reminds me of Chef John from Soho (right now the street).   As soon as I saw Japaneiro food on my IG feed, I gathered few friends to sample the food. The more the merrier and the more food we can sample.   I wish I wrote this as soon as I ate the food - we ordered SO much food and I wasn't even hungry - I could barely walk out of that place. I hope I'm able to write a decent review.  Beef gyoza - tasted fresh and homemade. I wish we ordered more (but, I'm glad I didn't cuz we have do much food coming!)  Pork belly - very clean, thick cuts or pork belly. Almost with they were caramelized like that of Goyemon.   Seared tuna steak - extremely beautiful plating. Perfectly seared.   Duo of uni and Ikura - pretty fresh uni and not too salty considering its topped with a large amount of ikura.   Tuna on lotus root - this was a different way of eating tuna. Reminiscent of Soho's tostadas but, I love lotus root so, I'm more biased on that.   Tacos - we got one of each taco. I love crunchy bite size mouthfuls :) I would recommend NO WASABI AIOLI tho. In my opinion, I think there was too much so, it over took the flavor of the fish.   Baked cod in lettuce wrap - can never go wrong with this. Marinated cod went well with the lettuce and perfect bites of rich flavor.   Bone marrow - dear lord, I could just eat that on rice but, it would be a crime against my body and healthy. So rich without the need of the salt and accoutrements it comes with.   Foie gras - it's duck liver amazing butteriness. I wish it did come with a baguette or something to spread on cuz it's texturally hard for me to eat on its own.   Lamb - three pieces of baby lamb (had to be baby cuz they were so small); perfect for eating like a caveman -- just hold onto the bone and chomp on! Do not expect large portions, as I did.   Chilean sea bass - fairly large piece of goodness. Perfectly cooked and not rubbery and/or over done with sauce.   Yakisoba - wasn't my favorite. I could've prolly been better without it and ordering something else (granted, we might have ordered the whole menu as it was).   Green tea creme br√ªl√©e + matcha tiramisu + green tea ice cream + banana lumpia was my favorite part of dinner. Not cuz I like desert but more so cuz they were all rich with flavor that wasn't sweet and very neutral which I like more often than not.    Service was very attentive. Too attentive at times but, they are a new restaurant trying to see what's a hit or miss with the patrons.     I, actually, had lunch here because of my love for bento boxes and their bentos are really the best deal for your buck!!!!"}
{"text":"The owner always treats us well. The staff goes out of their way to make sure we have a pleasant meal. The food itself is great. I visit every time I am in Vegas. I love coming here."}
{"text":"Friday night the place was empty. We were the only 4 people  in the restaurant. We made reservations last week as we were told we needed them. (LOL) The temperature is about  90 degrees or more. We had to ask for more A/C all of the food that we ordered was just marginal at best. My salmon was burnt to a crisp. My noodle dish was overdone as well. I didn't send it back because I lost my appetite because of the heat. All of us were extremely disappointed with the food as well as temperature of the restaurant.  Then when I was presented with the bill I was overcharged. I explained that I did not order this item to the server who did not speak English well. She called over the owner. He tells me that this is the price. I tried to explain  that the server quoted one price and now there's a $12 difference for two peoples orders. The owner  is an impossible person. He would not listen. The people in my party were uncomfortable so I just paid in full. I told him that the food/ service are terrible. He replied that other people don't think so. I said what people there's no one else in your restaurant on a Friday night that speaks volume. Sweat is dripping down my face, and the place reeks of cigarette smoke. We were thinking someone was smoking in the kitchen? I was looking forward to eating here for a while. I  don't understand how this place has such good ratings. I have to  question their validity.  I joined Yelp just so I could leave my review for this business."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing Asian fusion restaurant.   I had one of everything!  A variety of small plates and larger portions.  I recommend sharing of everything."}
{"text":"Bomb food, open late! Apparently the chef used to work at Nobu so the food quality and even recipe mirror what you can find at that restaurant but for almost 1/2 the price. They had a large sake selection, we went with the cucumber tyku which was very refreshing. The server filled out sake glasses every time we took one back which I appreciate the level or attention and detail."}
{"text":"I'm sorry. I don't get it. The food was bland and expensive and there's no atmosphere. Nice wait staff, but I think that's about the only positive."}
{"text":"Best Japanese meal in Vegas! Super. Hands down. We did a 7 course meal and got the premium sake. It was awesome. We are super picky eaters because our palate has been all around the world aside from the fact that we cook well so reviewing a restaurant and saying great things about it is something.   The flavors are just right and u can taste every bit of it."}
{"text":"Excellent food! We met chef Kevin, the nicest guy you'll ever meet, excellent service but most of all food is exquisitely delicious!"}
{"text":"THE WORST CHEF EVER! Me and 2 friends went in late night around 1:30 am, only 3 people in the restaurant the whole time. The whole meal was great until we ordered the yakisoba and yakiudon, they both had the same sauce which tasted like baked beans. Not for me or the rest of the party. We politely told our waitress we disliked the 2 dishes and she came back with the check and informed us that the chef/owner would not reimburse us for the 2 dishes we hadn't even eaten. He then came to the table and tried to justify his misfired dishes and threatened to call the cops if we didn't pay the bill in its entirety. I DO NOT recommend this restaurant EVER!"}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars people...really?! Where do I begin?  When we walked in, we realized the restaurant was somewhat small. Luckily, we had reservations so we were seated right away. There was a potent, rancid smell coming from the front/kitchen. I have no idea what it was, but we decided to continue our dining journey anyway. The waiter took our order - truffle edamame, bone marrow, salmon, the salmon and tuna tacos, and other items that I did not try (but my family ate).  The food started coming out one by one - and when I say one by one, I really mean one by one. The edamame first - small portion and ok. Not worth $5. Then five minutes later, the tacos - too much wasabi and ok. Not worth $4 for two tacos. Then the bone marrow - oh so salty that I couldn't even eat it. I had to take it back! Obviously, not worth $17 - they didn't even ask me if I wanted anything else since I didn't like it. The salmon - it was good, but it was drenched in sauce which I am not a big fan of.   Everyone was practically done eating - but there was one more entree we were waiting for and it was specifically for one person, my fiance. His came last - he had to eat his food uncomfortably while we sat and watched him since we were done eating. It practically took 20+ minutes from the first item was set on our table until he got his food.  That is ridiculous!  We didn't even see our waiter after he took our order, which annoyed me even more. We had to ask for our check from another employee. Overall, the flavor was not that great and the portions were so small that they were like appetizers! We actually left the restaurant hungry as hell that we were thinking of going somewhere else to eat! What a joke.   Seriously, I was questioning if I just got punk'd. I think I did. Japaneiro, you're good - you punk'd me!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out since a friend said I must try it.   Service was really great when we first got in since there was only one other table seated. Once it got a little busier, our waitress seemed to get a little frazzled. Our waitress was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu items though. They have a permanent menu that they give to you and their specials that constantly change, which is located on the wall which was really hard to see unless you got out of your seat.   We ordered rock shrimp which said it had a creamy, yuzu spicy sauce. It was alright. The dish was more sour than anything else. We also got the salmon and tuna tacos. The fish seemed fresh but other than that, nothing really to rave about. For my main dish I ordered the NY steak tobanyaki, which comes with a side of white rice. The presentation was nice because it comes out on a sizzling plate and the waitress pours the sauce right in front of you to caramelize. The dish was good but tasted similar to teriyaki.   Overall our experience was ok. I'm glad I tried it and the food selection is unique but I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"Despite it not being super close to the strip, this place delivers.  The bone marrow and wagyu were fantastic.  The hairy crab sashimi was amazing.  Loved the homemade Tiramisu.  Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday dinner.   Great quality but small portions.  Good if you like japanese /latin fusion.  Service was great."}
{"text":"Pretty unique and fun little spot. They have a good selection on the main menu, such as, the Tuna Tacos and Yakisoba (the Japaneiro special is crazy good - comes with Angus steak, Shrimp and Lobster).   However, the real fun comes from the seasonal specials. Seems like they have a ton of items that are only available as they have stock for them. They just got Salmon in stock last night, so the Salmon Belly Ceviche was super fresh and delicious. Also had the truffle bone marrow which is just as great as it sounds. They even gave us the bones to take home because it was my dog's birthday! So he signs off on this good review as well.  For dessert we had both the Egg Roll banana dessert with Milk Tea ice cream (some of the best ice cream) and the Mango cheesecake desert. Both were amazing. I am not a huge cheesecake fan, but the texture of this one was awesome. Also comes with a little kick of cayenne and honey on the side. The waitress was also telling us that the owner's wife makes gelato, but is currently on leave and will be back in 6 months.   Overall, wait staff was super friendly and helpful offering up menu choices based on our tastes as well as providing us with a unique experience by thinking of my dog.  Reverse happy hour is 10pm to 2am. No liquor license yet, so bring your own beer/wine! Chef and owner is doing a great thing with this place and will certainly become more well known very soon.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Just another Asian fusion place nothing spectacular just an average restaurant.  Place was nice and clean and the service was good.  Probably would never go back."}
{"text":"In between here and nowheresville, Japaneiro is quietly making a name for itself. The interior looks like any other casual Japanese joint, but the food stands out. The dishes compare to some fine dining spots on The Strip, but without all the hoopla. The plating of each dish is exquisite as it is art. An ever changing chalkboard has daily specials from the chef.   There are multiple small bites to choose from. Sharing is highly recommended. Start every meal off with an uni bite with ikura. The uni pairs with the roe to form a small taste of the ocean. The black cod lettuce wraps were little bites of heaven. But the best bite of the night was the mini foie gras blinis. The sauce on that foie was out-of-this-world good. Thank god for foie gras!   Main courses included the sizzling filet mignon and shrimp toban yaki with asparagus and enoki mushrooms. The certified angus beef was perfectly cooked to a medium rare. The yakisoba special was a nice noodle dish, but nothing attention-grabbing. For dessert, get the banana harumaki (spring rolls) served with milk tea ice cream. The milk tea flavor was spot on. I don't usually drive far away from The Strip for a restaurant, but this one is worth the visit."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for a friends birthday dinner. They've eaten here before and recommend it so we all decided to give it a shot.   The restaurant isn't that big so I'm glad they were able to accommodate a party of 16.   The food was very tasty. I had the udon soup (which wasn't on the menu but seen on yelp) and they were nice enough to still honor my order.  OMG... It was very yummy. They have happy hour at 10pm so since we were still there, I decided to try their $1.50 tacos. I had the beef, tuna & salmon and it was delicious!!!!   Customer service is great!!!! It was a nice touch that the chef came over and asked us how our food was.  Overall I recommend this restaurant :)"}
{"text":"I really found it hard to believe this place had 5 stars.  My experience and my taste buds must be very different from everyone else.  I came here with my wife and friend on a weekday lunch hour and sadly I just was not impressed.  The shopping center is literally empty with two other restaurants with chains and locks on the doors with another bar in the parking lot.  They don't serve alcohol and the decor was very univiting in my opinion.  There is bamboo shades separating the kitchen from the public with at least a dozen holes in the ceiling where they were trying to install them and obviously were too lazy to patch the holes.  I saw a spider web above our table on top of the light and the color scheme was confusing to me.  I do interior design for a living, so I just notice these things immediately.  The real reason for this review is the food and it didn't live up to the hype.  We had some appetizers and the tacos were some raw salmon sushi with goat cheese and it was just awful.  Some things just shouldn't be fused together...leave the tacos to the Mexican restaurants.  I also tried the shrimp and it was nasty as well.  I eventually had to order teriyaki chicken and that was okay, but anything else outside of normal was just not very good.  I don't think I will be back.  :("}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to eating here based up previous reviews, but left a little disappointed. All dishes seemed extremely oily. Service was excellent, but they were out of chicken that night and they don't serve alcohol. Not sure if we will come back."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy!! New cute small place. Loved that it wasn't really big. Service was good. They have a happy hour menu and alcohol will be on the menu soon!! Yay! Had several things and everything was delish! The presentation was great. The combo fried rice was so good!! Definitely recommend this place! And definitely during happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Exquisite food at an incredible low price! A hidden gem in Las Vegas!  Me and my friends always come here for some appetizer with beer (you can bring your own until they get the alcohol license). So relaxing after a long day work. Everyone here is so humble, attentive and informative. From what i heard, the owner here used to be the chef at Nobu. No wonder everything's so wonderful here (at 1/10 of the price)!!! This is absolutely my favorite restaurant in town! Love love love!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem off the strip. So unassuming but so worth it to find. Amazing menu and the happy hour is unbeatable. Love the bone marrow as well as the little small bites menu."}
{"text":"Great meal simple cost, good eats and good times the chefs and staff are very personal"}
{"text":"I was surprised by how underwhelmed I left Japaneiro after having dinner with two friends.  The three of us ordered the following items:  Spicy rock shrimp Japaneiro special fried rice Baby octopus Japaneiro uni chawanmushi Truffled marrow filet Nigerian prawn with spicy yuzu sauce Nigerian prawn with truffle sauce Nigerian prawn with uni Tiramisu Hojica nice cream Yuzu coconut mochi with genmaicha ice cream Banana harumaki  The standouts were the spicy rock shrimp, the truffled marrow filet, and the banana harumaki.  The spicy rock shrimp were very good and I could have gotten another order of them but it's not a dish you can't get other places.  The truffled marrow filet was quite good.  The marrow from the bone made the dish while rubbing the beef slices in the truffle sauce gave it some flavor.  The banana harumaki was a tasty bite of banana in a spring roll shaped to a point.  Delicate and nicely done.  The prawns were difficult to extricate from their shells.  While the meat was juicy, even three orders was very little food to split three ways with two prawns per order.  Of the three, the spicy yuzu sauce was the most flavorful.  I was not fond of the chawanmushi.  There were small pieces of uni in the custard that was watery.    Service was good.  I got green iced tea and my dining mates stuck with water.  Our glasses were refilled throughout our approximately two hours there.  Presentation was very appealing.  The restaurant is quite small with perhaps 10 tables.  The music was on much too loud for the small space.    Considering the meal came out to $60 per person before tax and tip, it was a pricey disappointment.  It's also in a location off the beaten path.  The meal was OK but it's not a place to which I'll return."}
{"text":"I stopped by Japaneiro on a late night and we ordered a few items. I specifically ordered the sashimi lettuce wraps, but my friends ordered items such as the Lotus Tuna chips which they commented were quite good, Angus Beef Gyoza, Chicken and Beef Kuchi, and Banana and Milk Tea Ice Cream.  The sashimi lettuce wraps which were good and they came with a good amount of chopped tuna and came with a mild dressing and tasted good. The lettuce cup was fresh and crisp and I enjoyed the crunchy thin noodles a top that which provided nice texture. I thought two per order was quite minimal.   I miso black good was pretty good, but the cod was a tad over cooked and a little dry. It's flavor was nice and a little more miso would of been nice. I did try a Angus Beef Gyoza which was okay. It was a lot of beef and it could of benefited from some scallions or leeks inside mixed with the beef to cut down on the plain beef flavor. Also, the beef could of used some seasoning.   I tried a beef and chicken kuchi which were good. The meat was tender on both, but a nice sprinkling of coarse salt on both would of been nice. I thought the marinade they both spent the night in was quite mild and needed more levels of flavor. It was quite one dimensional.   Service was very good. In fact our server was very attentive and was in very good spirits, and had a great personality. I wish I could remember her name. I all remember was that she had blond hair. Anyways, I think this place is better than my A-Okay I experienced this evening, but it is what it is...  Did I mention they make a pretty food green iced tea?"}
{"text":"A delightful cornucopia of treats. It'll cost you. Over $100 for two without drinks during happy hour. Gulp.   Regardless, everything we had was delicious, and we had just about everything. A few minor notes: the wasabi aioli overwhelmed the fish lettuce wraps and the taro chips with tuna and salmon were a bit salty.  I did not care for the mango cheesecake, mostly the texture.   The miso black cod was stunning! The sizzling shrimp with caramelization onions, asparagus and enoki mushrooms in a sweet sauce was delectable and a value at $14 for 6 plump shrimp. The beef on everything from the skewers to tacos was tender and flavorful. We really enjoyed the gyoza; they were so beefy and interesting. Such a departure from the average light filling. This was like biting into a cheeseburger gyoza. Yum. The bone marrow was tasty but we agreed you need 4 people to share the decadent dish. Too much for 2.   The Chef visited our table twice. We had great and knowledgeable service. I would certainly go again. There was much more to try. The experience will be better with drinks when they come."}
{"text":"Phenomenal experience and the executive chef is such an amazing person (he came out to share more about the food with us). We went to some great places while in Vegas -Aquaknox, Chiba Poblano, Gordon Ramsay's Burgr, Scarpetta, Caesar's Bacchanal Buffet, Eiffel Tower Restaurant- and this was the #1 meal for everyone in our party. Ambience is nice but not quite Strip-level which is totally fine. Definitely worth a trip and great quality for the price."}
{"text":"Fusion is booming these days. Gotta stay ahead of the trends, so I went to checkout Japaneiro for a lunch with my little ladies. The fusion menu is delicious, specifically the tacos and tostadas. Service was super friendly, with the chef coming out to check on us, and the waitress putting on the Frozen soundtrack specifically because my daughters said they liked it. They have a lunchtime happy hour, during which everything is on sale (I think that puts the tacos at $1.) Don't get too excited, though, because these tacos are literally one bite.  My main gripes: First of all, location is ok - southwest vegas - but it's in a random strip mall that is totally dead. Not too cool. Second of all, it's not exactly a lunch spot. The menu is pretty fancy and although the prices are good for this fancy-ness, they're definitely not cheap. However, it's not quite a dinner spot yet, either, since they don't have a liquor license! (I was there about a month ago, so maybe this has changed).  Verdict: probably won't be back (Yonaka, Soho, etc are still out there), but I love that cool spots are popping up all over the place these days."}
{"text":"Good food I love it  !  Try their  signature dishes you will like it for sure .Nice place for family night get together"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Vegas. The food was delicious! We had the truffle bone marrow, beef tacos, cod butter lettuce cups, rock shrimp, combo fried rice, lotus chips (salmon and tuna), and seaweed salad. The tacos and the cod lettuce cups are a must try. The service was exceptional. Our waiter was so attentive, friendly, and courteous. The food was brought to us with perfect timing- we were never waiting for the next dish. We met the chef who showed us an enormous, one foot long prawn! Overall, it's a great place for a group or for a party of 2.  The small plates are perfect for sharing. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"After seeing this featured in the Weekly, decided to check it out. I really loved this place.   It's located kind of in the middle of nowhere and the place is small. The upside is that it's intimate.   Started off with salmon belly ceviche with wonton chips. This is like the fancy man's salsa and chips. It was so fresh and they pour on the salmon belly. The truffle bone marrow was great as well. The rich fat of the marrow went well with the garlic. They even gave us three bones (instead I'm f the normal two) as they said the bones on their batch that day were a little smaller. The Uni bite was delicious at first bite but, as with urchin, you get that nice low tide aftertaste. I was happy the first bite was good.   If those items are a little much for you, their Japaniero fried rice is delicious without being weighed down by a ton of grease. What makes it special? I can never say.   Okay it's because it has chicken, beef, and shrimp.   For dessert, I inquired about the banana harumaki. It's fried banana wrapped in dough served with mango sauce and sprinkles of cayenne pepper. Of course I got that! Loved the warmth of the banana, the crispiness of the dough with the sweetness of the mango sauce finished off with a touch of heat from the pepper. It was a great way to end the meal.   What I particularly loved about the place was the service. The servers were knowledgeable, they explained the menu well and could explain the dishes when they came out. Sounds like a little thing but I've been to plenty of places where the servers didn't know half of the menu. Even the chef came out to check out how we were doing. Love those little touches.   It's a bit of a shame it is out in the middle of nowhere. They have happy hour and reverse happy hour menus which looked great. Going to have to trek down there one day to experience it."}
{"text":"Brought my California friend here for foie gras ! Everything was Amazing especially the A5 wagyu.   Glad that they now have the liquor license. So we had some drinks to pair up with our food.   Service was outstanding. The severs are absolutely knowledgeable about the food, wine and sake. Remember to ask for their recommendations because they know the best.  Don't forget to check out their special menu on the chalk board.  This place will never let you down!!"}
{"text":"Idk which is better, the food or the service?! Plus you can bring in your own alcohol; two thumbs up!! It's only my second time here, but the servers treat you like they've known you for a while. And the \"Truffle Bone Marrow\" is off the chain. The food here always seems to amaze me. Just when you think you tried it, the chef always has something to impress you with. Nothing short of SPECTACULAR!"}
{"text":"New neighborhood restaurant?! We have to check it out, and we did.   What we ordered:   Chawan Mushi - Not steamed in the typical cup-size, but rather a wider, slightly shallow dish. Also, their version did not have any meats or veges in the custard. Regardless of the variations, I enjoyed the creamy texture of the custard and the flavor. I did not miss the meat and veges, and liked the fine slivers of pepper garnish as the added texture and flavor.   Beef Gyoza -  I'm still undecided about this dish. I know the gyoza were made with good quality Angus beef, but I'm not sure I am ok that the beef was cooked medium-rare inside.   Bone Marrow - It was good and it was certainly a larger portion than expected. The salts on the side were not needed, as the top of the bones were sprinkled with enough salt. Not a huge fan of the tortilla chips that came with it and there was not enough for the two large pieces anyway.   Chilean Sea Bass - Always a solid bet with Chilean Sea Bass.. and was no different here. The fish was pan-fried, not overcooked and seasoned well. The jalapeno sauce sounds overwhelming but complemented the white fish, and added a freshness. It kind of reminds me of dishes they serve in the tropics. The menu tells you the oz. the fish will be, but the one we received looked larger than what was stated  Fried banana dessert - the fried banana with the Phllyo Dough was good, the Green Tea ice Cream was good... separately though.   Yes, it's true, they have large bottles of Panna for $3 - that's a steal for a restaurant.   Looking forward to coming back to try other things. Maybe I'll run into LJ! Lol!"}
{"text":"Great service and unique food! MUST try chawanmushi-it is soooooo good. I loved how everything is made of UNI!!! Chef was very nice and explained so kindly about every dish we ordered himself. The chef is very passionate about his work. I also thought bone marrow dish was very interesting. It came with chips so you can dip the chips into the seasoned bone marrow. Last time I was there (it's been a few months) it was also BYOB without a cork fee."}
{"text":"Came here on on a Tuesday night for a friends birthday celebration, we were the only ones at the restaurant but figured, better service for us!  As soon as we sat down, we were explained the menu and were told to take a picture of the chalkboard menu as it changes daily.  We pretty much let the host and birthday boy order all the dishes, but every single item ordered was delicious!  We pretty much had just about everything from the raw seafood items (ceviche with chips, wonton tacos, kuromoto oysters), to side dishes: fried rice, yakisoba, butter lettuce wraps and entrees: grilled steak, rock shrimp and bone marrow.  Everything was pretty much tapas style and was good for sharing for our party of 7.  After taking a few shots of sake and taking down a couple glasses of Asahi Black, things started getting a little hazy and all I remember was food kept coming out of the kitchen to the table and I continued to sample and really enjoy every single bite I had, down to the sauces that accompanied the dish.  Unfortunately the alcohol blurred my judgement and I wasn't able to take photos of every item but some of the most memorable would be the ceviche of tuna or salmon with taro chips, the grilled chicken entree with sesame sauce, and the desserts!  Would definitely like to come back and try some other specials on the chalkboard menu.  *Yelp says $$, I would say more like $$$, our bill came out to about $500+ for a party of 7 with alcohol."}
{"text":"Amazing bone marrow. Very nice place. Chef was friendly. Will come again to try new things."}
{"text":"This is a cozy restaurant in the corner and I really enjoyed the food there! The staff was so friendly and courteous!"}
{"text":"Food and service are on point here! Highly recommend the black cod on butter lettuce, Nigerian prawns, and Uni shooters"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and left with a check that had 17 beers on it. There were 3 of us gathering, trying to support the local food culture in Las Vegas. I had heard great things of this restaurant, but it seemed like an episode from \"In Living Color\" because our server was also the bartender, busser, one of the cooks and apparently the owner too. We definitely enjoyed the dishes we had, we tried almost every appetizer and the gyoza's and bone marrow were outstanding, BUT our bill was definitely padded. My friends and I will not be returning and have let people know to steer clear of this location."}
{"text":"WOAH! I don't even know where to begin... I've been hearing about this place ever since it opened and decided to treat my mom for dinner since I got my paycheck! I got more than I expected.   As soon as I walked in I was greeted by a warm welcome from the chef and a waitress. We sat down and was explained all of the specials and clarified what the kushiyaki (skewer) was and what a tobanyaki (hot skillet) was. We ordered a few appetizers: gyoza, rock shrimp, truffle bone marrow, uni bites, salmon tacos, and the butter lettuce wraps with black cod. The gyoza was soooo good. I've never tried dumplings with only beef inside (usually it's filled with rubbery meat and veggies)  and the eel sauce on it was just the cherry on top. I wish they sold these at the market. The rock shrimp is fried jumbo shrimp cut into pieces and mixed in a Yuzu creamy sauce which isn't overwhelming at all. I usually stay away from anything with mayo and I was afraid I wouldn't like this too much but the Yuzu in the sauce made it tasty and I couldn't help but finish it! I've never tried bone marrow cooked this way before! It's definitely something you have to try before you cross it off the list. The wonton chips on the side with the truffle dressing on top of the marrow was excellent and so rich in flavor! The uni bites were the best uni I've ever tried in my life. I don't think I've ever had uni with a different sauce than soy sauce with wasabi! The sauce in the uni bites were a better combination overall. The salmon tacos were my favorite because I think I could eat this all the time. The wasabi aioli on top and inside the tacos made such a party in my mouth with the raw salmon. I hate raw onions but the ones in the taco actually changed my mind about uncooked onions. I was surprised by the chef's creation. Lastly from the appetizers, the black cod butter lettuce topped with some crunchy flakes were wonderfully done. The juicy cod marinated in sweet miso with the buttery flakes were truly amazing.    Going on to the main entr√©es, my mom and I ordered the Nigerian prawn with uni butter, scallops and the filet tobanyaki. The Nigerian prawn was the biggest shrimp I've ever seen. I love shrimp and it totally had a juicier and meatier taste than other shrimps. It was also cooked on the Tepan grill so maybe that's the reason why it was so good. The uni butter had chunks of uni and who could ever dislike that? Next we had the scallops and MAN..... I never knew scallops could taste like this. How the scallops were seared and raw on the inside truly was an orgasm in my mouth. Just when I thought I couldn't handle anymore exciting flavors, the tobanyaki came out. The waitress was extremely good at handling the skillet and waited until the smoke was fairly safe for it to be placed in front of us. It was a sight!   Overall, the food came out quickly despite the fact that it isn't a fast food restaurant, the drinks were filled constantly, we were checked up on by the server about our food and how we found out about the place,  the chef personally talked with us and made us feel important, therefore we were impressed. This restaurant knows how to treat their customers! We will definitely come back and try more of their items with our friends! Can't wait for them to surprise me next time! It is pricier than your bowl of pho but come on it's Japanese fusion with high quality selections! I'd rather pay it here than at yard house or Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"This place is so good the food and the service the best. U have to give them a try.  They do not have their liquor lic. Yet but they should be getting it soon, that should not stop u from going to at least lunch. They open up @12:30pm and close at 2am And they have happy hr. 12:30 to 6pm It's a little small inside so do not take to many if ur friends. The servicer did say he served 20 people as a group. There is also a few seats outside."}
{"text":"This restaurant is good. Found it in accident after work. The best things is they open late & Near my home. Love it!!Oysters. Uni. Cattle bone marrow. Foie gras with truffle. Delicious."}
{"text":"I've had the opportunity to eat at some amazing places, like Kabuto here in Las Vegas, and Taskeshi in NYC, and I will tell you hands down this is one of my top places to eat!   It's a small restaurant so get here now! The Chef is humble and his love for food and talent really shows in his dishes. This makes the food even more delicious and enjoyable.   This place is a gem! Hurry and try now because soon this place will be packed, as all new comers will also realize how amazing this place is.  Great job chef! Thank you for bringing high quality food off the strip and introducing us to what true amazing food is."}
{"text":"Best Japanese fusion in Las Vegas! Got everything from low end food to high end food all using quality ingredient!! Chef Kevin is the best! Menu is creative, you will not find combination like this anywhere."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, service is on point and the two times we came here it wasn't busy. If you want fancy food, with the convenience of not going to the strip, this is the place! I believe the chef worked for Nobu, which explains the great quality. Flavors are superior, and everything we had was delicious! My favorite has to be the miso cod. I also like anything truffle, so truffle edamame was addicting. I didn't like the wasabi dollop on top of the tacos, but loved the salmon lotus chip which did not have any wasabi on it. Im not too big on spicy, and while the rock shrimp had a bite, it wasn't too spicy and I loved it. It was a filling meal for my girlfriend and I who ordered about 6 dishes, which came out around $60. I really like the tapas style which allowed us to share and get a bite of everything. I'd highly recommend this place, especially for late night!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. So many reasons for me to come back here!  Here are the delicious items that I sampled last night:  Truffle bone marrow  Uni bites Fried rice Salmon belly ceviche Banana harumaki Iced green tea  The bone marrow was such a treat and the truffle oil complimented it very nicely. It was also very nice of them to throw an extra bone in because it normally comes with two and the batch they had were too small. The salmon belly ceviche was so fresh tasting. Salmon can get a very fishy smell or taste and it absolutely did not have any of that. The fried rice was delicious and I really dug their special fried rice that has a combo of all three meats, in case you cannot choose just one! The banana harumaki was just amazing. Warm and gooey banana on the inside with the hint of heat from the dusted cayenne pepper.   The chef even checked on us and asked us if we wanted some extra wonton chips for our dish. You can tell that he has a try passion for the restaurant business. This place also has amazing service. Super attentive and willing to answer any questions. I also really liked that every time our waitress dropped off a dish, it wasn't just a dash and go. She explained all the parts of the dish and the best way to eat it (such as with the dessert, that if you move it around on the plate, you will catch more of that cayenne pepper).   A little tip: at this time, it is bring your own bottle! No corkage fee! This may change once they have a liquor license though. I also looked at that happy hour and reverse happy menu. I will definitely be back with a bottle of wine and an appetite to dive into their amazingly-priced little happy hour bites."}
{"text":"I had high expectations of Japaneiro after hearing about it from friends and also because I was driving across town just to eat there. They exceeded my expectations!  We ordered the uni bites with ikura, foie gras, Japaneiro yaki udon and sashimi lettuce wraps. All were amazing; yaki udon and uni bites were my favorite.   The three uni bites were from Santa Barbara, Catalina and Japan. The sauce on top made it difficult to taste a difference between the three, still really good! The foie gras was good, but did not stand out for me. Same with the lettuce wraps.  Yaki udon is one of my favorite meals to eat in Japan and the Japaneiro version did not disappoint.   Japaneiro does not have a liquor license yet! If you're looking to have some sake/wine with your meal, you might want to check them out a little later :)   I was really disappointed by how quiet they were on a Friday night, spread the word, guys! They deserve more customers :)"}
{"text":"Welcome Yelpers to the taste buds cruise! Prepare yourself to embark on an amazing journey that will leave your taste buds in euphoria. I ate so much good food, I was ready to die.   Let's begin with the items that blew my mind and every body part that has feelings. Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef. Wtf?! Yes I'm serious Yelpers, this is the highest grade of wagyu available and it was melting in my mouth. It came with different ingredients to top off each bite of heavenly steak. The yuzu and truffle oil made an excellent dipping sauce.  Bone marrow with truffle oil and garlic chips. Let me tell you when the bones arrived and I was scooping, yes scooping, the marrow I felt like Fred Flinstone. You know what I did with some of the bone marrow? I ate it with some of the wagyu! (Microphone drop)   Nigerian prawn truffle. What is in the Nigerian waters because these prawns were huge! My girlfriend and I fought over these bad boys. Topped in truffle oil made it so irresistible.   Bluefin Toro and Uni. Two of my favorites tucked nicely in a spoon. Three spoons of this amazingness was getting better after each bite. Very creamy.  My girlfriend fell in love with the chicken udon yaki. No broth because it was stir fried. She destroyed it.   I also had a handful of the appetizers from the happy hour menu and by far the favorites are the rock shrimp, beef gyoza, chicken kushi, and salmon lotus chip.  Presentation of each item was a piece of art. By far the best dinner of my life. Everything I tried was wonderful. The owner, Kevin, was very entertaining and the service from Sarah was impeccable. I can feel their passion and it shows in the food. Each time I come to Vegas, this is a definite must."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a mind blowing authentic Japanese experience... This is it.  A diamond in the rough, this strip mall find was a phenomenal experience. Japaneiro was recommended by a top Las Vegas strip executive and we were excited to taste its wares. The chef blew our mind. We are foodies. We have exquisite taste and chef did not disappoint.  Lolo is an asset to this establishment . She made our experience incredibly enjoyable. We left there craving more and cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"Got really sick after I ate there and was puking the whole night. The salmon I ate smelled off but was so hungry I still ate it. The service is excellent though."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious have the Nigerian prawns with all different three butters Uni butter was my favorite the staff was friendly a lot of similar things to Nobu but for half the price!!"}
{"text":"Delish! A must try for sure. The quality of the food is certainly something you will notice after one bite. They do not skimp on any of the ingredients and you can tell by the finished product. The presentation of the food is something out of a Bon Appetit magazine. The customer service really does set them apart."}
{"text":"Great food! This is our new favorite late night spot, the rock shrimp tempura, tacos and chicken kushiyakis are my faves! We're coming back every week., buy 1 get 1 house sake and $15 pitchers for happy hour lets go!"}
{"text":"Food here not so great as it was referred. Although, I have to give credit for the presentation and service."}
{"text":"Chef Kevin never cease to amaze us with his creativity! Tried the sea bass and black cod today, and I can only say \"amazing!\" He doesn't spare the expense on getting the good stuff. Fresh sea bass and black cod, never frozen. If you're a true foodie you know. Firm meat and not flakey at all. Japa√±eiro just got bone marrow in today and got to be the first person to try it.. I work in a steakhouse and compare the two marrows, very well done Japa√±eiro! Another special we got today was the chawanmushi (steam egg). Of course this is not your typical chawanmushi.. it is topped with ikura and uni in a rich seafood broth. The smooth and creamy uni actually gave the silky egg more texture. Nigeria prawn is perfectly cooked with yuzu cilantro sauce. Another amazing meal here at Japa√±eiro!!"}
{"text":"Japaneiro is a hidden secret in Las Vegas. I'm amazed at how creative the chef is, i would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Thought we try a new place and turned out to be another delicious place we will come back too!  Everything we ordered was good!  Beef tacos, truffle oil edemame, sea bass, filet, shrimp."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a hidden gem! Just moved to the area so wanted to explore and try something new. Found this place on Yelp, read the reviews, and I was not disappointed! Started with the truffle edamame, ate the entire bowl. The kind of edamame where you make sure you don't miss a single drop of the seasoning on the outside. So delicious!! I ordered gyoza, one of my favorite foods of all time. I loved that instead of pork they wee filled with STEAK. The sauce drizzled on the top was so good I asked for an extra side to dip and also put on my Yakisoba. Only downside is I couldn't order 50 of them....perfectly crispy on one side and soft on the other. Superb! I had the Beef Yakisoba, a tad sweet but with the sauce from the gyoza added it was perfect. I didn't leave anything in the bowl when I was finished. My partner had the Black Cod which had a perfect char and he also finished every last bit. We had the Hazelnut Cheesecake for dessert which was divine! Everything was plated beautifully, and we practically had the entire restaurant to ourselves. Service was great, food was 10 out of 10! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here around 2 am.  They close at 3 am.  We were cravig some tacos so we had to come here.  Ordered the salmon, tuna, and beef tacos. So yummy!!! I also loved their miso soup. Very hot & tasty.  Our server was great!! Even the coon was friendly. We checked in and got the free edamame which was superb and different."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food is always on point. Atmosphere is casual and chill but the food is better than most fine dining on the strip. The truffle bone marrow is a must!!!"}
{"text":"Experience:  met some friends for lunch. High ratings on YELP and in the area, so we picked this spot. We arrived at 11:30 to be completely surprised that it doesn't open until noon. I can imagine they miss out on some business as many people take 11:00 lunch.   Facility: it's has clean, modern feel with not very many tables, but perfect for 2-6 people.  It's located in the corner of a small strip mall, that is pretty much empty.   Service:  I will chock the service up to being new?! I was immediately turned off by the fact they had no diet drinks to offer.   Ok, not the waitress' fault, so that's not a strike against her.  But I didn't like that I went to the bathroom and as I walked up, she was going over the entire menu and I missed it. Besides, we were still waiting for one more person. Then, I asked for straws twice, refills on drinks and we had to ask for Sriracha twice. She was nice enough and took her time to explain details when we asked questions. I just think her mistakes are rookie and hope she will get better with time.   Food:  I ordered a few appetizers because they have a happy hour that starts at noon on appetizers.  Sea Bass lettuce cups - these were very small one bite cups with a small portion of fried sea bass.  I think this is the first time I ever had sea bass battered...I'm used to it grilled and detracted from the usual buttery flavor of the fish. Would not order this again.  Beef taco - I ordered this after I saw someone else's come out. It is a two bite mini taco, but it had a nice crispy shell with good flavored beef and a wasabi flavored aioli on top. It was good, but looked a tad better than it tasted.  Spicy rock Shrimp - this was a decent size portion compared to the other apps. The shrimp were fried and coated with a spicy citrus sauce that wasn't very spicy, but still tasty.   Tasted the following of other people's plates: chicken yakisoba - good flavor...a tad sweet.  Beef kushi - this had a good flavor, but I was a little disappointed in the quality of the meat. Definitely not top shelf meat.  Fried rice - good flavor, but not amazing.   Overall: I wanted to give this place more stars, but our lunch was just not that impressive.  One person at lunch suggested we were probably the fail, because we did not try some of the more specialty items like foie gras or bone marrow. I will give this place another try at dinner, and I'm absolutely going to order the bone marrow!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome, unique spot for Japanese food! Everything I've had here has been great, and they have liquor now! Service is always friendly and fast. Definitely one of my favorite spots to go!"}
{"text":"Exquisite sashimi!!!!! If you ever crave quality fish late randomly look no further. Excellent service from the waitress and owner. Had to have some dishes changed to my eating restrictions and it wasn't a problem:)"}

{"text":"When I visit Las Vegas I like to eat as the locals do off the strip. Heard from a few people that Japaneiro is a must try. Coming from Oklahoma we don't get this type of food so this was going to be a special treat to try something so new and unique. I came in during happy hour because I like to base my return on whether they have good apps or not and japaneiro did not fail to amaze me. I pretty much tried everything they had to offer or until I ran out of room in my stomach!   Tuna/salmon tacos with wasabi aioli  Tuna/salmon on lotus chips Alaskan black cod on butter lettuce wrap Rock shrimp with spicy yuzu creme sauce Black angus beef gyoza  Beef/jidori chicken kushi  Japaneiro fried rice  Everything was crisp, fresh and flavorful! I rotated from one item to the next. It all complements each other even though they are completely different. If I had to chose one item out of them all to order seconds it has to be the black angus beef gyoza. It wasn't the typical gyoza I find at other places and they definitely do not skimp on the beef. It was plump and juicy! Punched me right in the mouth with its flavor!   I returned a few days later to try the blackboard menu. Japaneiro serves seasonal items so you know everything will be fresh. The blackboard can change frequently and it shows the skill and creativity of chef Kevin to create dishes on the fly with whatever he gets that day.   Yakisoba noodles Truffle marrow with chips Truffle marrow filet Banana harumaki Yuzu coconut mochi with genmai cha ice cream  Speechless...that was my reaction after eating my first bite of truffle marrow with chips. So good I ordered the truffle marrow filet. That was my first time to eat marrow and I was highly impressed. This was definitely an amazing dining experience. Everything I had was delicious and beautifully presented. The staff was nice and attentive. They were helpful and so glad they recommended the marrow. Chef Kevin talked to me about anything and everything so I got a chance to pick at his brain a bit. Awesome guy and even better he's made an awesome spot for locals and travelers like myself. I highly recommend Japaneiro to anyone and everyone! I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Had an awesome food experience. The owner/chef Kevin was awesome and very passionate about his art. However, his staff member, our server, I wish she could have made our experience better by being more knowledgable about the menu, have more authentic recommendations, and be more attentive to our needs. I felt if this was improved my experience would have been 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for 4 but really didn't need it as it was empty small place.  Place much smaller inside than corner location would suggest.  Service was friendly efficient and chef accommodating.  We ordered the $150 7 course tasting for 2 - everything carefully prepared and excellent.  Started course with raw scallops with topped with salmon roe.  Then it was oysters with uni, Nigerian prawns, escargot, final course was truffled bone marrow  topped with filet mignon and Foie Gras and tiramisu for dessert - that makes 6 total.  Was my husband correct and they only gave us 6 dishes or did we just miscounted?  I also ordered sake tasting for $12.  My son had Scottish Salmon (somewhat like teriyaki).  My daughter had two pieces of raw Scottish salmon.  With order of side salad and miso soup total bill was $210 plus tip we ended paying close to $240.   Activated my Yelp free truffle edamame, but had to ask twice for it.  It was similar to price as on strip restaurant Morimoto.  If cost was closer to $175 I'd give it a 5 star.  Great food, decent service but overpriced for where it is located.  If it was on strip that would be different but I'd expect a slight break in price being off-strip in residential neighborhood."}
{"text":"Salmon Lotus chip was amazing Foie Gras duck liver was equally amazing chef really friendly and staff. Been there three times already. Also Bone marrow was great kind of pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"We came in right when it opened on a Saturday and it was happy hour. I had a salmon taco, a beef taco, and the rock shrimp (I think that's what the last one is called). My bf had a beef taco, salmon taco, and Nigerian prawn. The tacos were amazing. The beef was so tender. The salmon was fresh. The shrimp had an amazing flavor. The Nigerian prawn was kinda difficult to eat but it was good.   The server was really knowledgeable and nice.   I know they use top quality meats and that's why some of the items are really pricey. However, I felt some items were a tad too pricey."}
{"text":"I don't know why they get high evaluation?! They've rare Japanese craft beers, could be imported from Japan. It's wonderful idea so we accept their effort. However here's overpriced food overall.   We ordered Blue fin tuna and Uni with Otoro. I forgot how much was it, but bluefin is just three spoons tiny tiny bite size and Uni and Otoro is just two spoons of same as tiny bites. We are very disappointed of that. And sauce was too strong for fresh sashimi. How wasted of fresh Sashimi! I mean it's spoil the flavor.  truffe oil Edamame was just no thank you for me. The truffe oil have been already oxidized. So taste like that sadly.  Salmon (I forgot exactly the name) sauce was too sweet and strong again. Scottish salmon was very fresh so we didn't know why their taste always too strong like spoil the fresh sashimi flavor. What a waste of fresh sashimi :0  Jidori kushiyaki was tender and juicy and sauce was amazing! I love the one!   Anyway, we can't agree with their overestimating. But service was good, so we felt their effort.Hope they are going to change their sauce more mild, I mean they should take full advantage of  the original taste of ingredients and then mildly price."}
{"text":"I came here for my friend's birthday and it was good! The server was really knowledgable about the menu and thoroughly answered our questions. I got the filet mignon Tobanyaki style.  It came sizzling and it was very delicious. The only complaint I have is that the food came out at different times and the time between was really long. So I got my food ~10 min after my friend and that was awkward. But other than that, pretty good :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and it was amazing!! Service is awesome and food was incredible. Prices are a little high but worth every penny. They also have a great Happy Hour from 11pm - 3am Mon - Sun. It truly is a hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"Located at Volcano Grille's old spot which just moved down the street on 215 & Durango  [CUISINE] Woah. Absolutely AMAZING. I ordered quite a few things to split with the party I was with and was extremely pleased with everything we ordered.  Salmon Taco: the sauce has a slight wasabi flavor. I typically don't like wasabi but this was so light and beautifully done. The fish was very fresh!  Chidori Bento: This free range, hormone free, dark meat chicken was incredible. The bento was complemented with a small seaweed salad, a spring salad, tempura (omg that sweet red onion), and a steamed egg. Yummy!!!  Chilean Sea Bass: Wow! My favorite thing so far! (I'm coming back to try that certified angus beef ribeye steak, looks freaking amazing!) This outer layer was seared to a perfect crisp. Wow. Just wow. Eat it.  [DECOR] This small boutique restaurant has beautiful chairs  and large wall to wall windows. They kept the hand painted murals from Volcano Grille which was a full wall of bamboo on one wall and a Japanese Caligraphy art inspired Volcano on the other wall.  [SERVICE] The server was very nice. The chefs took the time to greet us and talk about the food, they are all so sweet! The beautiful pastry chef also came out and described the desserts in detail, I was in such awe that I ordered everything! I was not dissapointed! I'm so full I might die though! Haha!  [PRICE] A great deal for the quality of food. The specialties such as the filet mignon, the Chilean sea bass, and the certified Angus beef rib eye (24oz!) are all top notch quality. I'm happy they described in detail other menu items, I want to try everything here! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to my fellow yelpers and had to give it a try with the boyfriend since it combines his 2 favorite cuisines, french and japanese.  Can't believe how close this place is to home and that we never knew about it until now!  Ambiance: 4/5, tucked away in the back of a random shopping center, cute white hanging lights outside, nice music, inside was pretty casual, nothing too special  Service: 5/5 everything came out quickly and the server was very attentive  Truffle edamame: 5/5 the truffle flavor combined with the salty flavor was amazing, lightly  toasted  House salad: 4/5 fresh spring greens, amazing sesame dressing that was very flavorful QQ, would have preferred some toppings as it was a little plain   Hot green tea: 5/5 very nice subtle flavor, high quality leaves and had a nice color  Rock shrimp: 4/5 sweet, tangy, and SPICY! Really good flavorful but I'm a pansy and can't eat spicy.  Would have given 5/5 if I liked spicy  Truffle marrow filey: 5/5 OMG, insanely delicious! This dish is a MUST try! The marrow was so tender and flavorful. I scooped up every last bit of it. My bf got his with the foie gras which I highly recommend.  It was excellent.    Banana harumaki: 5/5 amazing! Sweet bananas baked inside of filo dough with a sweet glaze. My favorite part was the milk tea flavored ice cream that it came with.   This place is now one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas! Very unique dishes and it's open late too!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Such a great find off the strip. The plate presentations are too pretty to eat! But definitely eat because everything was delish. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable about what they were serving. You can read what all the other yelpers wrote about their dishes... or you could just go there and try for yourself! My vote is try for yourself. It is definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Food is a bit pricey, but tasty,  well cooked and easy to share.   Restaurant is small, maybe 10 tables.  However, the restaurant hasn't been busy the 3 or 4 times I've been there.   My favorite things are the bone marrow filet (their signature dish) , the black cod which is fatty and delicious, and the filet mignon with the pour over sauce.   I've taken friends and family here to give them a taste of good food off the strip!  Definitely recommend it at least once."}
{"text":"Great food and VERY friendly people who work there. We were visiting Las Vegas and wanted a late night snack but didn't want junk food. There is a happy hour from 10 pm to 2am. I had the yakitori udon with beef. It was delicious and it was just the right amount of food. The rock shrimp was really good, too. The only complaint I had is the strange sewery-like smell. It might've been because we were seated near the restrooms.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I love this place! Nice little gem tucked away in the corner with lots seating and string lights in the patio. Best part of it is it's away from the strip and no traffic! Excited for the other good-eats to open in that little corner. They don't serve alcohol yet but they're totally down for you to bring your own booze.  BYOB! Say whhaaaaa!? :)   Service here is phenomenal. They really want to make sure you have a good experience. Because it is a fusion menu, they are willing to answer any questions you may have.   The food here is unexplainable. Though I've only tried four different things, everything I've had was delectable and it leaves me wanting more! Everything is fresh and full of flavor! The presentation is great too. I'm in love with their tuna and salmon tacos and obsessed with their rock shrimp. Their menu changes every week to ensure freshness and quality of the food. There's always something different to try! Their weekly menu seem to always consist of bone marrow, exotic fishes, uni, and foie gras.   My tip?   Try Everything..  ..at least once. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We really wanted to love Japaneiro... we tried. Let me first state that the service at this restaurant is outstanding. We came in right when this place opened on a weekday and were ready to dine!  The house chardonnay and Asahi were the best parts of the meal unfortunately.  Our first item, the beef skewers: inedible. They were so gummy and chewy I spit them into a napkin.  So we weren't off to a good start, but some spicy mayo rock shrimp... how in the heck could that go wrong? No. The rock shrimp were covered in a ginger-ish / citrus-ey flavored spicy mayo. The flavor was complex and thoughtful, but to us it just didn't taste good.  The black cod butter lettuce wraps were just meh, not really any flavor to speak of. There's no special glaze on the cod, so it's just a crunchy-cod and lettuce wrap.  The yakisoba noodles... again, the flavor was interesting and complex... tasted kind of like barbecue or smoky-ish flavor, but it just didn't taste good.  Salmon Lotus chips, just OK. Probably the 2nd best thing besides the alcohol.  Maybe this place just isn't right for us; the food all had interesting and unique flavors that we've never tasted before and although we didn't like the food, clearly other people do, so yeah. Great service though!  Oh-- I forgot-- the edamame!!! Ok, so their garlic edamame (which we got for free for checking in on Yelp!) is seriously legit. Possibly the best edamame I've ever had. So Japaneiro wasn't a complete bust."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Vegas!!! It's wayyyy better than alot of restaurants on the strip! Nice presentation and the food is sooooo delicious! This is the first time I ever write a review on yelp with a 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Hidden treasure.... Everything was delicious, staff is very helpful and know the menu very well.   Big fan of this place will Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"This place was outstanding!  We went for dinner last night with a party of 5 and were able to get seated right away.  The waitress was fantastic, it was like she was spring-loaded to our table, and was very helpful.  My son and his wife ordered the special 7 course meal for 2, and the other 3 of us ordered ala carte.  We got the miso soup (excellent), rock shrimp (nice), black cod and sashimi butter lettuce wraps (excellent), salmon and tuna lotus chips (great), tuna and salmon tacos (good), beef kushiyaki (ok), land and sea tobanyaki (outstanding) and Japaneiro special yakiudon (good).  The main course on the 7 course meal was the bone marrow filet mignon with foie gras (possibly the best fusion dish ever).  This was by far the best Asian fusion meal I have ever consumed."}
{"text":"We've came here about 3 times now.  Love it more and more every time.   It's super convenient here.  Happy they open late until 3 AM.  We can always count on here being open.  Service is always great.  Truffle Oil Edamame  Gyoza Rock Shrimp Chicken Kushi Beef Kushi Hokkaido Scallop Ceviche Scottish Salmon Sashimi  Beef, Salmon, Tuna Tacos (I wasn't a fan of the beef taco) Chilean Seabass Butter Lettuce (The only bad part is they were super tiny!) Truffle Marrow Filet with Foie Gras (TO DIE FOR! VERY RICH DISH)  We ordered two more items but I can't remember it.  Everything was super tasty.  We'll be coming back here more often."}
{"text":"Amazing service!! I came here last night for my birthday dinner and everyone was so sweet the servers and chef Kevin! The food was so good!!! I'm definitely coming back!! I loved it!"}
{"text":"Delicious high quality food. Must try their unique version of green tea cr√®me br√ªl√©e."}
{"text":"Im sorry but there was an odor similar to scortched eggs that irritated me. I beared through it but was excited to leave. Food had good taste but portions were extremly small."}
{"text":"Amazing!  I felt like I was back in Japan again.  The scallops are so buttery and fresh.  Lamb chops were delicious.  Black cod, salmon ceviche, baby octopus,  everything was mind blowing.  I just moved here from san diego and I am so excited that there is a place of this caliber so close to where I live now in Vegas that is open late at night even.  I will definitely be back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"I dont really understand how they got pretty nice ratings. I really wanted to leave no stars if i could. When i walked in to the restaurant there was nobody. Just us. And Restaurant smelled like sewer.   We ordered rock shrimp which was too salty. Truffle edamami, was soso but i guess the oil was little old, Loctus salmon was soso. And worst dish was the oyster. I didnt know people actually can make the oyster taste that bad. We asked Server before we order, whats on the oyster and he said its LIGHTTT on a ponzu and wasabi sauce but i guess server didnt even understand what he was serving. Oyster wasnt that fresh, it was way toooo much soaked in the sauce. Everything was salty and flavorless. Never goin back."}
{"text":"Great food, small space, and great seasonal selections!  Loved the gourmet experience in such a small location, off the strip, and great service!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place since it opened. I've heard some good reviews from friends and seen on yelp. I also heard this place is run by former Nobu chef. I have some friends in town and decided to try this place last night. We had a large group of people. There was 18 of us. We made the reservation prior since it was for so many of us.   When we got there, the table has not been set up yet. We waited for them to arrange our table. After we sat down, it took our  server four times back and forth to get our drink order right. He kept forgetting what we ordered and we only ordered either hot tea, ice tea or water. I really didn't  think it was that difficult. Then we ordered by section for the food and asked to split the check by section. Some sections got appetizers and their main entrees while some other didn't even get their appetizers yet. They forgot quite a few things that we ordered and we had to keep asking. The sever wasn't apologetic at all when we asked our missing orders. After we got our check, it wasn't the way we asked to split either. Overall, services was 2 out of 5 for me and it ruined everyone's experiences. Most of my friends said they would not go back. I feel kind of embarrassed by recommending this place for us to try.   Food   1. Salmon tacos (3.5/5): it was average. Nothing really special about it.  2 . Rock shrimp with yuzu sauce (3.5/5): it was average too. Nothing great about this either. Kinda like honey walnut shrimp but not as good.  3. Catalina Island uni (4.5/5): I love uni from Catalina island. They have pretty fresh ones here.  4. Chilean sea bass (3.5/5): the cilantro dressing was not flavorful enough for me. Sea bass was fresh.  5. Truffle bone marrow (4/5): it was pretty good except it was bit salty for my taste and I couldn't use any of the seasoning that came with cuz it was bit salty already.  6. Japaneiro fried rice: (4/5): it was pretty good combination fried rice.   All in all, I would not recommend to come here with big groups. I like the food but I was not in love with the stuff I've tried. I may come again in the future and try other stuff on the menu when they have a system in place and with a smaller group."}
{"text":"come  here during happy hour and try out their small plate, its Japanese with Asian fusion, all items I tried is in the pictures below, food & service are  great, btw, their presentation reminds me of Soho on Jones.."}
{"text":"I came here because it was the only thing open late night that looked interesting, & it just happened to be happy hour! We ordered everything from the happy hour menu... Started off with the edamame & house salad. You can never go wrong with edamame or at least I have yet to find a place that has managed to screw it up. The sesame dressing on the house salad was so yummy even my meat loving boyfriend liked it! The tacos were good (we had beef & salmon), but I'm not a big fan of wasabi so the wasabi aioli was a little too much for me. The beef in the tacos were a little more on the dry side. The rock shrimp was definitely on point! The gyoza was delicious! The black angus beef inside the gyoza was well seasoned & juicy. I just wish they would cut off the fat, but I guess some people like that rubber stuff sometimes. Next, I had the butter lettuce wraps. The Chilean sea bass comes fried with the wasabi aioli on top...not bad once I wiped some of the wasabi off. The black cod comes grilled...the flavor was great, but the fish itself was definitely NOT fresh. Lastly, our dessert was green tea ice cream with coconut filled Mochi on top. I've never had Mochi that didn't have ice cream inside so it was something new to me but overall a good dessert.  I would normally give this place 3 stars based off the food quality; however, they earn an extra star for being open late since it's difficult to find a quality place that is open late, especially in this area."}
{"text":"AMAZING! SPECTACULAR! DELICIOUS!   first impression: looks nice from the outside.   Inside: clean and enjoyable atmosphere   Service: immaculate, very professional, and polite   Food: cooked perfectly. My mouth kept wanting more. Ordered more than expected because it was so good.  Price: for two it was $113, BUT! I couldn't be happier to pay what I did, seeing how the service and the food was so freaking amazing.   Conclusion: I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone who wants to enjoy a \"strip like meal\" at half the cost! The happy hour was amazing, and even though we ate at midnight, the service was nothing short of spectacular.   We will be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is by far one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas.  A definite \"must try\" for anyone looking for a great culinary experience!"}
{"text":"Adrien was awesome! She sat us quickly and served us even quicker.  She was super cool and paid attention to everything we ordered.  The food was great.  They were out of gyoza so we didn't get to try that, but everything we did try was amazing.  Great late night spot"}
{"text":"Went to japaneiro yesterday with two friends. This place is in an obscure plaza with nearly nothing around it. But I think it's a hidden gem and worth a try!  We ordered from the appetizer list and pretty much just stuck to that portion of the menu the whole night.   Rock shrimp- 5/5. Really good portion, flavors and crisp. Can be a little too heavy if you eat the whole bowl all at once.   Salmon ceviche- 5/5. Again a pretty good portion. Comes with chips and you can always request for more chips. Salmon is fresh and the sauce is great!  Scallop ceviche - 4/5. I like the salmon one better. This one was good too but a bit oily and has too many big chunks of raw onion.   Tuna taco- 4/5. The tuna isn't quite seasoned. But it comes with a wasabi aioli that pairs well. I just wish it had some avocado or another ingredient in it to brighten it up.   Scallop lotus chips- 5/5. Yumm. This has a sweet note to it and was really good. Lotus is not super crispy but really good. Scallop was so fresh.   Chicken yakisoba?  5/5 It's the thin noodle with mushrooms. Really good flavor. On the sweeter side but I like sweet.   Chicken kushiyaki 4/5- chicken on w skewer. Really tender and juicy.   Baby octopus 2/5. I like the octopus. It was slightly chewy and meaty. But the yuzu sauce was very very overpowering. I made the mistake of eating it in one bite so all the sauce was in my mouth. The best way is to wait it is take off some of the sauce, request a knife and cut it up into a pieces.   I will definitely come back to try the specials on their menu. Especially the froie and Uni!!!"}
{"text":"OMG this place is amazing!!! I went last night to try the tobanyaki shrimp, salmon tacos, tuna lotus chip, and the yellow tail sashimi!! The manager I believe was soooooo nice! They told us about their amazing happy hour times and to be sure to look at their chalkboard for specials. Everything here was delicious, reasonably priced for quality fish and beef, and the service was amazing!!! I will definitely be coming here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Food was a solid 4. Service a 5 and beyond. Great presentation. A unique menu. Might go back for their scallops. Again, we practically ordered the entire menu per usual. The food good. The hubby thought some of the food was over cooked and maybe not as fresh. But for sure the best bang for your buck. You also won't find many places that offer such a unique and good menu @ 3 am.   Pros:  Most of the dishes were very yummy with a different twist  The service was awesome  Especially great if you have a larger group with a fancy palette. Because it's almost 1/2 of what you'll somewhere on the strip.   Cons:  Ran out of a few items on the food menu and saki menu  Hubby said it was truffle overload. May not be a con if your into truffle oil.   All in all, a must try and worth the 10 minute ride of your staying on the strip."}
{"text":"I am so glad that I stopped in this little place this evening. Service was impeccable. The food is absolutely delightful. The atmosphere is well coming. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the southwest.  Excellent selection of fresh fish that rotates daily. A little pricy but worth it for the quality!"}
{"text":"This place. Super good.   Came here over the weekend on our way to Muse. BTW, Muse in concert = astounding.   This place is a bit pricey, so be prepared. For me, it was somewhat worth the price. As any other place in town (off the strip), I feel that you can really pay for the quality of the food you're getting. I get really tired of people complaining about prices when it's good food. So another reminder: if you look online prior, you can see how much their dishes average. If you don't like those prices, try a place that's more to your price liking. But keep in mind, this should be about quality, service and atmosphere.   We had a lot, so let me go over what I thought was WELL worth the price.   The Rock Shrimp - the waitress told us that it was popular. It was super tasty. Large pieces of shrimp, fried and served with their creme sauce.  I ordered a special - Wagyu beef. First off, this was $22 an ounce. I only ordered 2 ounces, but it was so fucking good. They served it with their truffle sauce and numerous salts/spices. Amazing wagyu.  Tobanyaki - Filet Mignon. I didn't order this, but my friend did. And I ate some. And it was sooo good. I don't usually like filet.  Black Cod lettuce wrap - Insanely tasty, to my surprise. I don't like cod. But however they prepared it, it did not taste near as fishy as I'm used to.   The only thing we didn't like was the Gyoza. It was very oily and it seemed to make the dish overbearing.   Overall, this was place was excellent. It's tiny, so be prepared for a wait on a weekend. But the service was excellent. Our waitress was very well informed and was very happy to answer any questions we had. Worth the $115 for two people."}
{"text":"The only thing stopping me from making this a 5 start is the portions. They are pretty small, but sooo delicious that you want to order more.. But I'll definitely be back for the bone marrow! The gyoza was so good, so was the soft shell crab and tacos. Hopefully next time I come their portions get bigger."}
{"text":"Very classy a lot of fun great things for adventurous eaters. Great for dates and they have Mexican coke and Fanta in bottles."}
{"text":"Will definitely come back. Thank you Chef Kevin and Lijia. So far this is one of the best Japanese Fusion restaurant I ever been in Las Vegas. Your food brings out a very good flavor and it's just amazing. Everything that you serve to us is so good. Good people, good food, good service. Your guys are the best."}
{"text":"I should have taken photos!   But I was so wrapped up in their food. Came here with my bf and his parents for a Sunday dinner. Happy Hour starts at 11pm so I guess I'm not surprised we were the only party here at 7pm. It can be a little pricey when it all adds up. However, you are paying for quality bites.   I tried each of their tacos - the samon, tuna, and steak. All 3 were delicious. I was pleasantly surprised that they give you 2 of each so I was already full by the time my fried rice came.  And even though the taco shells were crunchy, their portions made it so you could eat it in 2 bites (without making a mess).    The shrimp in the fried rice was fresh, although the rice was a little bland. My bf ordered the noodles and maybe next time, I'll do the same. For dessert I had their coconut mochi ice cream. I'd never had coconut mochi before but I plan on keeping an eye out for that option in the future.   All in all, this place looks like the perfect spot to go to for a late night happy hour. Quality food for a deal? Yeah, we'll have to come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely Fantastic! Very well refined cuisine. The Chef has perfected his dishes. Each dish was individually sophisticated.   We ordered the chef choice tasting menu for 2. This was arguably the best meal I've ever enjoyed. We were lucky enough to have the chef serve us each meal and he walked us through every detail of every dish. The chef made our experience that much better. This is a hidden gem. A MUST TRY Culinary exploration of elegance!   The final course was a Bone Marrow topped with filet mignonette and foie gras. It doesn't get any better than that. We could have died happy right then and there.   I am grateful to have experienced Japaneiro!!"}
{"text":"Not your typical Japanese restaurant. Dishes were served tapas style and every dish tasted great. Highly recommend the black cod and Scottish salmon sashimi."}
{"text":"We had the tacos, shrimp, and scallops on the happy hour menu and they were all delicious. We did also try the bone marrow and it was amazing"}
{"text":"This place is by far one of my favorite spots in town. Everything is very tasty and flavorful. It is a hidden gem and a hole in a wall. The restaurant is small and the owner Kevin is your server/chef sometimes.    I have tried their rock shrimp, scallop lotus chips, tuna tacos and felt like they were all good and delicious. Aside from these dishes, the main dishes here to try is the bone marrow w/ filet mignon on top, uni and scallops, and their rib eye. Each of these main dishes were mouth watering and very tasty. this place really likes to top things with truffle oil which i think really enhances the flavors of each dish. The food here is very fresh and the ingredients are top quality.  I always recommend this place to friends and family. It is also a nice casual date night spot.  Service is amazing, ill definitely be coming back to try other dishes"}
{"text":"Om. Nom. Nom. Everything is to be savored in this restaurant. Simply scrumptious and a delectable treat as I would call it a bazillion dinner quality. A+."}

Admittedly a 'locals-only' sort of spot, and removed from Spring Mountain a bit of a novelty considering the locale, entry to Japaneiro sees the diner face-to-face with the kitchen and flanked with enough seating for a total of just thirty the service trends friendly without really being transparent, a limited laminated menu joined by several chalkboard specials that are detailed with limited explanation while costs are even more obscured - several numbers written next the name of an ingredient with the staff not really going out of their way to describe the upcharges or price per serving.  Sipping water and iced green tea, both provided with copious refills at no cost throughout the course of a ninety minute stay, it was in three rounds that orders were placed after asking a few questions and beginning with two modestly priced menu items the first bites of lightly battered shrimp in spicy cream sauce offered a brief glimmer of hope, the house 'special' fried rice tossed with beef, shrimp, and pork a competent rendition, but certainly nothing to write home about.  Moving next to several specials, three baby octopi were next presented with a good char and snappy flesh beneath light citrus at a cost of $4 each and although the nicely seared filet dramatically draped over a delicious charred marrow bone was indeed a dramatic presentation, the $34 surcharge for flavors marred in cheap truffle oil were still quite excessive - the use of the oil additionally making one wonder what other shortcuts the kitchen may be willing to take.  Thoroughly  underwhelmed by watery Chawanmushi carrying an upcharge of $13 from the five dollar base due to the addition of one meager tongue of Japanese Uni, it was onward to prawns that the meal progressed, and with confusing menu pricing seemingly the rule than the exception each \"6oz\" Nigerian specimen carried a unique charge ranging $23-$28, all but the yuzu and wasabi-tinged cheapest featuring the crustacean overcooked and more than a little tricky to liberate from its shell with the use of only chopsticks, spoon, and fork.  Seemingly offering a bargain with desserts, and at this point certainly nowhere near full despite the eventual tab of $75 per person, suffice it to say that neither the tiramisu or mochi are particularly memorable save for the high price per bite, and although the Banana Harumaki with $3 ice-cream supplement was admittedly well made with creamy fruit tinged in sweet cheese beneath the lightest of shells it still was not enough to save the meal from regrets of not going elsewhere, a situation admittedly unexpected and leaving one to wonder what others see in this place that the group clearly missed."}
{"text":"This place is a fusion of Japanese French Flavors! If your an adventure of foods this is a must try place! I recommended trying the bone marrow as well as Scallop Sashimi! I can't explain how delicious they were in words. There waiters are extremely knowledgeable and will answer any of your questions! Also there happy hour is amazing so many selections for great price!"}
{"text":"Everything here is good, you can order blindly and you can't go wrong! Get the truffle bone marrow, it's hella good!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The night was filled with incredible food with each course.   We got 3 apps. Grill baby octopus, tuna lotus chips and salmon ceviche. All amazing.   Then we got the beef skewers, fish tacos and lamb chops.  Good Lawd this may be the best meal we've had in a long time.   Full of amazing flavor and great service.  We even had two bottles of sake and the tab was $136 before tip.   We will be back for sure !!!"}
{"text":"This is the hidden gem of Las Vegas! The food is out of this world!!! The only thing better than the food is the service. Between conversations with the Chef and the staff, you definitely feel at home. The Black Cod with miso sauce is off the chart! If you\"re looking for a memorable night out with family and friends, look no further......"}
{"text":"...for me this is a tough review...one of my foodie buddies comes here often- throws down a ton of cash and loves it...me not so much...he truly knows food better than I do...in my mind closer to three stars...I actually spent a lot of time thinking why I had an issue as food was decent (not great)...all I could come up with was that the interior reminded me of a breakfast joint from the 50s...so..."}
{"text":"With the many Japanese restaurants in town, how can another one stand out? Don't offer AYCE sushi - that's a good start. Have excellent service with attentive and friendly servers. Have a smaller variety on the menu but execute them well. And that's exactly what Japaneiro does.  Their menu only has two pages and a board with their specials. Sometimes, having a huge variety can be problematic. But their small menu covers everything even for a group with dietary restrictions/ preferences. Beef, fish, shellfish, veggies, chicken, and lamb - they have it.  Truffle Oil Edamame: Free with Yelp check-in. They grill the edamame drizzle then with truffle oil and lightly salt them. The grilling makes a huge difference giving the same old edamame a nice smokey flavor. My friends and I kept talking about this (for reals)! 5/5  Scallop Lotus Chip: Thin crisp lotus chip with a big piece of fresh scallop. Good flavor and texture. 4/5  Escargot: You get 2 garlicky buttery snails in shell on a bed of seaweed salad and umeboshi on the side. I wish I had bread to soak up the warm garlic butter. 5/5  Scallops with Uni: Scallops topped with uni in a citrusy savory sauce. Light and refreshing + the creaminess of uni. 5/5  Salmon Tacos: Crispy tacos with fresh salmon with a creamy citrusy sauce. Simply yum! 5/5  Grilled Baby Octopus: I was the only one in our group that love and crave octopus. If I see it on the menu, I just have to have it. Nice char and smokey flavor. However, the tentacles were a bit tough and chewy. 3/5  Black Cod Lettuce Cup: Think miso black cod on a lettuce cup - yup, that simple! Slightly sweet black cod with a light sauce. Our table got a 2nd order. 5/5  Uni Chawanmushi: Savory custard with a nice broth, and generous portions of uni. 5/5  Their desserts all seem good: hazelnut cheesecake,  banana harumaki with hoji ice cream, matcha/ hoji ice cream, and yuzu coconut mocha with matcha ice cream. Since I can't have dairy and it's a very long drive home, I didn't get to try any dessert."}
{"text":"Go during happy hour. Amazing food and amazing prices, I especially loved the salmon lotus chips and the rock shrimp was actually a good size portion."}
{"text":"Really great food and a very pleasant surprise.  The items were flavorful and had unique twists...definitely an adventure in every bite.  Portions are smaller, so expect to pay more to get full, but its quite worth it."}
{"text":"This place is ON POINT. Get the Chef's Tasting menu!  Great service and even better food."}
{"text":"So this is my 2nd time here and this place always has a good amount of top quality items on their menu. We couldn't decide on anything so we decided to go with the 7-Course Chef's Tasting Menu ($118 for 2 PEOPLE) which is a steal.  Items that came with it:  Teramoto Scallop - My first thought was fuckkkk I hate scallops and the times I had scallop they were cooked. The plate came out and they were raw scallops...tried it with the ponzu sauce and god damn it tasted like any other sashimi...this was a great start  Scottish Salmon Ceviche - Came with what I believe is wonton chips....very flavorful however a little bit too salty and sour...  Kumamoto Oyster Uni Foie Gras - This dish was fire. Sad it was only one oyster per person but this shit was fire. You can taste the sea in the uni and oyster and the foie gras brought out this buttery goodness. The butter of the sea with the butter of the land aka butter of the world. One of the highlights.  French Escargot - Never had this in my life and was slightly intimidated, just like eating them crickets at El Dorado. Did not know what to expect but it tasted earthy as fuck. I thought I was eating spinach gum. That's my way of describing it.  Nigerian Prawn - Great dish and the meat closest to the head was juicy. Flavorful and juicy. Great light transition into the....  Truffle Marrow Filet w/ Foie Gras - This shit was overkill in a good way. Like you playing Madden and you 21 skunk somebody but they still wanna play so you blow them out 56-0. First there is a bone marrow and then they stacked with medium rare filet then on top of that you can put foie gras. This was pure goodness for any meat lover and was the excalmation point to the meal. Must get if you go here for sure (will cost you around $50 w/ foie gras...)  Last thing was the desert.   Banana Harmaki w/ Milk Tea Ice Cream - Nice way to finish off the meal with something that is light but flavorful. The milk tea ice cream was crazy...don't really fuck with that boba shit but this really did taste like milk tea....  Overall excellent experience with the chef hailing from Nobu but with a fraction of  the price of what they would be charging there."}
{"text":"This is my favorite late night restaurant. The food is delicious and the flavors are highly addicting, especially anything with the truffle yuzu. My favorites include the Nigerian prawn with truffle yuzu, baby octopus, grilled oysters, and rib eye with truffle bone marrow. The service is fantastic and the food keeps me coming back at least every 2-3 weeks. This spot is a must try and is comparable to many restaurants on the Strip."}
{"text":"We thought to try this place since we were nearby and craving Japanese food.  Food: we decided to try a bunch of small plates an appetizer so that we can get a taste and feel for the restaurant. My husband tried some of the udon noodles and I tried some of the yakisoba noodles and we all shared ceviche as well as dumplings and skewers. The food was delicious and we really enjoy the flavor of all of the different sauces. My favorite was the Wagyu beef dumplings and also the truffle oil Edamame.   Drinks:  there was a large variety of sake to try from. We tried the hot house sake as well as the coconut sake which were both delicious and reasonably priced.  The server was very friendly as well as open to answering all the questions we had about the menu. My only hiccup would be that there was a separation of price between the entr√©e meal as well as each side that they came with. I thought that the entr√©e should come with a side and vegetable, for example, instead of it being all separate and al le cart."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this restaurant unfortunately I guess my expectations were set too high because of all the great reviews for this place.. The service was great the waiters and waitress's who work there were very nice and they knew the menu very well.. My husband and I tried a lot of things on the menu and the specials too.. It seemed like this restaurant tried to do a cheaper version of nobu but it was still too expensive for the quality of the food. The worst thing We tried was the soft shell crab which had a weird odor and smelt like it was old. Overall the dishes were bland and no dish was really good but also no dish was really bad with the exception of the soft shell crab. For the amount we paid and the food we got it wasn't worth it..  And one of the waiters told us that the chef was once the executive chef at nobu at the Caesars palace we know people who work there and he was only a cook. Kind of silly to lie to your customers.."}
{"text":"Oh my God I'm in love with this place! The food was so delicious we did the tasting menu. I loved the foie gras scallops and the bone marrow was delicious!! So much food! I definitely recommend this place Kevin was our server and he was amazing!"}
{"text":"Really tasty, good service and incredibly affordable. Lunch for 2 with a ton of food was about 30 bucks because of happy hour. While that may be average for lunch for 2 off strip, we ordered a LOT of food. A ton of tacos, a few orders of gyoza, butter lettuce wraps, miso soup, fried rice, rock shrimp and something else that I can't remember right now. We were expecting 50+ for our bill. Service was friendly and the chef was running food to help out, since it was a little busy while we were there. He also stopped by once it slowed down enough for him to come out and checked to see how everyone was enjoying the food. The only thing I can say is that I hope they add more to the menu, because I loved everything and I'm excited to see what else they can come up with."}
{"text":"The dishes, flavored, and presentation is different but I felt that some of the dishes were overpriced. In addition, the restaurant was really hot when I went for dinner. The A/C could've been lower. In addition there is alcohol served here. Must bring your own booze."}
{"text":"I love coming here for their late-night happy hours starting 10pm. A couple of my favorites to order are the rock shrimp (which you also get for free if you check in) and the salmon tacos. They're super tasty and are both discounted on the happy hour menu. I also love their milk tea ice cream, probably one of the best tea-flavored ice creams I've had in town. The service has always been great and staff super friendly. If you're having a late dinner or in the mood for a midnight snack, this place is a great option. It doesn't get too busy even during their late-night hours, so you definitely don't have to worry about waiting. Very good food and experience overall!"}
{"text":"With so many notable spots for fusion cuisine having popped up in the middle of the desert over the past few years, Japaneiro kicks the door down and slam dunks their excellent menu into the Asian fusion ring with authority.   Like a lot of the gushing reviews already mention, the chalkboard specials by the entrance is where the gold is.  My advice would be to take a picture of it to look over with your tablemates so you're not like me and getting up to look over the board again and again as if it were on display at a museum.    I can never say no to foie gras.  If foie gras told me to jump off a bridge, buy it diamond earrings or crash my car through a convenience store, I'd do it.  It was well cooked and those tasty notes of fatty tenderness in a savory sauce were music to my mouth.  I even showed some restraint by offering the last bite to my wife. :P  The Nigerian prawns tasted as impressive as they appeared.  Large and succulent, the truffle butter sauce that it was accompanied by took it to another level.  The green salad offered a nice balance to the whole dish.  I admit I sucked on the shrimp shells to savor the flavor and only felt 3.1% ashamed/embarrassed about it afterwards.    Our meal luckily managed to carry over to the late happy hour that occurs M-F 10pm-midnight.  Ending the meal with some great small bites like the salmon/tuna/beef tacos and miso black cod lettuce wraps.  The standout was the rock shrimp with its terrifically crispy fry, micro wasabi kick and cream sauce made it an absolute steal for $5.50.  I guess that shows how good these chefs are; they even managed to make rock shrimp interesting!  The lack of description for many of the items caused me to underestimate things like the \"European Sea Bass\" until I saw it brought to another table near the end of our meal.  The fish looked marvelous with the meat being filleted post-grill and the rest of the carcass twisted up for an interesting look.  I was practically seething with jealousy!    Lesson learned: everything is awesome and get that the next time."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the great spots in town, I went there on Monday and Wednesday nights, I wouldn't go to the same spot so often but food there is delicious, thanks to Kevin, great customer service, everything gets to the table superquick!) definitely will be back!) variety of the menu is awesome so much to try"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and this chef is legit. His food is creative and really tasty. I asked him where he trained and he replied \"YouTube\". So if true or not he paid attention to those videos. You are in for a treat. The ingredients are quality and the food is top notch. Bone marrow the best I have had. Firecracker shrimp, steaks, tacos, etc are all excellent. I need to make this a regular place."}
{"text":"Still absolute favorite restaurant in Las Vegas!! Been coming here for many years and love the fine dining delicious quality of food somewhere off the strip and close to home.   Chef and Owner is a great guy and makes the best dishes for his menu. You don't have to feel the need to be overly dressed like when dining on the strip, but you get that quality of food and smaller atmosphere which i love!    I always order: Edamame with Truffle Oil French Escargot Uni bites Scallop Sashimi with Uni on top Rock Shrimp Tempura Salmon Belly Truffle Marrow Filet  & mix things up when I get dessert.    I know I'm going to be spending more money then usual on dinner, but every single dish i know is going to be delicious and satisfying which makes it all worth it every time."}
{"text":"Really great restaurant with an owner who seems to really care. The staff was friendly, polite and happy to explain all their creative specials. The beef gyozo and tuna tacos were my favorite off the happy hour menu. Unbelievable prices for the amount of protein in each serving! We will be back often."}
{"text":"Honestly the food is complete crap.  It's doused with unnecessary oil and exaggerated portions of various sauces to mask the mediocre quality of the food.  I have it 2 stars because the service was nice.  But the food.  I'd rather eat mcdonalds"}
{"text":"First time here, the food was not really good, not worth that price. IchiZa is more better. We ordered the black cod butter lettuce wrap which make us so disappointed. The fish was too salty and burned. And the truffle bone was too oily. I will not coming back again."}
{"text":"Wow we had a wonderful experience here. The food and the chef, Kevin was amazing. Sara, the waitress was extremely accommodating. We had everything on the menu including bone marrow. YUMMY. ALL the seafood was fresh."}
{"text":"Salmon Ceviche. Tuna and Salmon tacos. Combination Yakiudon. Scottish Salmon. Just. Order. Them."}
{"text":"I rarely get to this part of town but made a mental note to come back when I could based on my first visit.   The food is fresh, creative, and tasty.  Like the food, the service leaves nothing to be desired."}
{"text":"It's good.  I've been there twice now and ordered the steak both times.  Once with a large group of ten, so got to taste most of the menu.  The one minor complaint is they allow too much for seasonings, all the salts and side flavors.  Whittle down to 2 max and offer it with the steaks.    The other dishes like noodles and rice were spot on, adults and kids finished them all."}
{"text":"Checked out this restaurant last night with some friends, and the food was so delicious. I'm so glad we decided to order \"tapas-style\" so that we were able to try a little bit of everything. With all of our dishes combined, we had the black cod butter lettuce wrap, gyoza, shrimp fried rice, salmon ceviche, shrimp kushiyaki, japaneiro yakisoba, chicken yakiudon, and the truffle oil edamame. (I'm probably missing a few) My absolute favorite dishes that night were the gyoza, salmon ceviche, and black cod butter lettuce wrap. I don't even know where to begin with the gyoza--the meat was sooo tender and flavorful. I like that they drizzled the sauce on top of each individual piece. The sauce was so tangy and just the perfect amount for each piece. The salmon ceviche!! My goodness. I just wanted that dish on a bowl of rice or noodles or just plain because it was sooo good. Only complaint is there wasn't enough of it! Lol The black cod butter lettuce wrap packed a big punch in just a small bite, which was very surprising. Cod was cooked & seasoned perfectly.  Loved this place and I will definitely be back to take advantage of their daily specials next time!"}
{"text":"The wife and I went to Japaneiro for a late dinner. We ordered 7 items.   Things I love: Rock Shrimp - it's a must try, great flavor and texture. It's not too spicy but if you don't eat spicy then probably skip this.   Things I like: Kushiyaki Beef- very tender and flavorful. Scallop lotus chip - the chip was nicely fried and the scallop was sweet and delicious. Black Cod butter lettuce wrap - the fish was moist with different texture contrast in one bite. Oyster Uni Foie Gras - good combination of flavors but not the best in town.  Things I don't like: Hazelnut Cheesecake - lack of hazelnut flavor and cheesecake taste. Whale soft shell crab - the sauce was too overpowering. I could barely taste the crab.  Overall experience was fine, my server took care of us. Will probably return to try few items on the menu like the bone marrow. Value wise definitely is much better at Japaneiro than other similar restaurants on the strip."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went here twice already. It's a okay place. The service and food is good but the food has a small amount of serving. Not enough food pretty much. All we can say to this place is \"come here with a full wallet and a full stomach\" Lol"}
{"text":"I normally let things pass. But this one takes the cake, And I just can't let it go. I would give no star if I can. This place is the most horrible costumer service. I came here around 230am and they close at 3am. I ordered 2 fried rice, gyoza and rock shrimp then sat outside to wait. Fast forward 38mins later, I ask for my food. The \"owner\" told me they're still making it and if I can sit down. So I told him that I just wanted to ask because we've been waiting for almost 40mins. He then told me that he then rudely told me that He can  refund my money if I want. So he told him that yes he can just refund it. I told him that that is not the way to approach costumer, he told me \" I AM THE OWNER AND THIS IS A PRIVATE PROPERTY PLEASE STEP OUT\" Some costumer service!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food 5 stars for the service  I love this place already. I was welcomed the second we walked into this restaurant. The server, named Sarah, was very knowledgable about the whole menu, answering every question without needing to ask the chefs in the back. Even the green tea is great too! It's not too bitter too! So in the end, we ordered tuna tacos, a side of miso soup, and a beef yakisoba.  The tuna tacos had a good crunch. With clovers and wasabi added onto the tacos, the flavors bursted in my mouth! For some reason two small tacos were filling, maybe it was the spices in the tacos. After this, the miso soup came out. The miso soup is actually unique. There were micro chives in there, and that gave the soup a unique taste! Last, but not least, the yakisoba.  The yakisoba was interesting. It's pretty much fried ramen noodles, but better. The top of the bowl had thin fried fish, and it was moving around! That kept me amused for a good minute before I destroyed the food. Everything was actually pretty filling!  Overall though, this is a hidden gem. I hope many people find out about this place so they can bloom with business. They definitely deserve it."}
{"text":"Three stars for the very nice staff and chef. the Japanese and  French food fusion concept just didn't work for me. I'm an experienced traveller and I have lived in japan, Hawaii and other Asian countries . I don't consider myself a food expert , but I've certainly had my share of exotic Asian foods.  It was an ok experience but nothing to get excited about. I wouldn't recommend to anyone wishing to try Japanese food ( because it's not Japanese food)  Small portions and pricey, there are better eateries out there . Personally I think traditional Japanese izakaya fair is much better ."}
{"text":"First off - our server Jeffrey was fantastic. I would give Jeffrey FIVE stars. The food gets a three.   We went for happy hour and picked a few items to start.   The chicken skewer came out which I originally ordered for my child. I tasted it first and after biting into it, I spit it out right away. It wasn't fully cooked. I sent it back.   The Edamame with truffle oil was my favorite. The shrimp dish we got with sauce on the side and it was a lot of batter. The Lotus Chips with tuna was okay. Nothing tasted fresh to me. Maybe it was because of the semi-cooked chicken.   I am a little sad after this. I know we only had Happy Hour but after reading all of the excellent reviews, I was surprised to get the quality of food that we did. Our server was great and extremely professional.   I would like to say that we would try it again because of how great he was but unfortunately our experience with the food was not good."}
{"text":"I came here last night with my friends. It was my first time and I loved it!! The waitress was very cute and nice! She was attentive to our needs. I can't wait to back and try some more interesting items on the menu :)"}
{"text":"Great food.   We've had a wide array of items here and everything is on point. They have a killer happy hour and we loved both their NY Steak and Shrimp Tobanyakis. Service is also A+.  We try and stop in ever time we visit Las Vegas. Plus they are open late!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem with wonderful service and amazing dishes full of flavor. Adrienne took incredible care of us. The salmon ceviche was spectacular. My husband and I happened to stumble across it and will definitely be a new favorite that we frequent!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing! It was a wonderful experience from the minute we walked in. The food tasted delicious and was cooked perfectly and the presentation was very impressive! Our waitress was friendly and very knowledgable about everything on the menu. We defiantly will be back to try everything else!"}
{"text":"Truffle Marrow Fillet & Foie Grass is so delicious. My frist time been this place best, great service!"}
{"text":"This place is so good and legit that I have to write a review for: definitely 5+ for the amazing food and attentive service!! Chef Kevin Chong is from Nobu which I dine in a lot due to my work. My clients from San Diego even emailed me to recommend Japaneiro after they tried it!  I walked in with really high expectations, and Japaneiro put smiles on all of us, party of 4! Everyone is satisfied, and each dish we had is never a disappointment.   TRUFFLE EDAMAME: freshly made, not the frozen ones, you can taste the truffle sauce, simple and tasty to open your taste buds.  RAW OYSTERS: certainly high quality that it will be a waste if they were cooked.  BONE MARROW: rich, creamy, and full of flavors, comes with chips.  SEAFOOD UNDON SOUP: the chef told me that he doesn't have the special broth for undon soup tonight, but he can stir fried the undon for me! Hell I am determined and shameless to ask him to put undon in miso soup as I am craving for hot soup in this drizzling weather. The flavor is not the main concern. But the chef surprised us with this amazing undon soup with great broth and fresh assorted shrimps, sea bass, scallops and vegetables! Thumbs up to Chef Kevin's flexibility and cooking skills!  DRY-AGED STEAK: even it's not Wagyu beef, but it's a wonderful piece of perfectly cooked steak. We order medium well, and it's still tender and juicy! I love the two types of sauces on the side: mustard and the truffle oil is awesome!  FRIED RICE: the simplest dish is how you can see the skill of a chef. This fried rice made by teppanyaki is so tasty with beef, shrimp, chicken, and crunchy sesame. Best fried rice in town!  FOIE GRAS: I love foie gras, and yes, order it.   DEEP FRIED BANANA WITH GREEEN TEA ICE CREAM: the ice cream is special, not the typically biter green tea taste but fresh and with the touch of sesame, we all love it.   SCALLOPS: after I \"FORCED\" (lol) the chef to make the undon SOUP, my bestie shows him the picture she saw on line and asked the chef to make something \"Scallops\". And what the chef presents us is the HEAVEN of scallops!!! These SWEETEST Scallops with jalape√±os create a happy universe in your mouth. It's that good that after the dessert, my bestie has to order it again before we end this happy meal!!!!   This place is hidden, the menu is simple, but the food quality is to die for. The chef told us, he can make almost everything, just name it, and everything on the menu is great!  Again, I eat at Nobu a lot, and I love SOHO, but Japaneiro beats them both!!!!"}
{"text":"Taste: 3 Creativity/Authenticity: 3 Atmosphere: 3 Service: 5 Bang for your buck: 3.5  Now i know your probably wondering why i only gave this place 3 stars... lets break it down. This place is good but there were some key things that eventually brought it down. First the place is located in a strip mall that has maybe one other store in it so the parking lot is empty (better for me because i like my service) second when we walked in the door we were literally the only people on a sat night?! good or bad sign. We were greeted by the owner and the staff with delight and welcomes. Lets get to the food, started with the bone marrow, black cod lettuce wraps and the oyster shooters. I love bone marrow, ill eat it everyday if i could the bone marrow here was amazing one of the best I've had. The black cod lettuce wraps were nothing special, I've had them at many other places before but the only difference is this place they are really small, like eat 2 at the same time and its still one bite very small. Now to the oyster shooter... i don't know if you've ever had a bad oyster shooter but you will know when you've had one and well unfortnetly we got 2 bad ones. They were so bad that i almost puked! have you ever drank the juice from a not so fresh oyster? yeah taste like ocean and bad fish. Next we got the rock shrimp, fish tacos and the chawanmushi. Lets start with the rock shrimp they were cooked perfectly but the problem i had with them were the flavors were so overwhelming they didn't compliment one another. The fish tacos were good but again they were very very small. Last but not least one of my most favorite japanese dishes chawanmushi a very delicate egg custard some are made with seafood and some vegetables. Unfortunately i was not a fan of their chawanmushi, once again they just had too many complex flavors which didn't compliment one another and eventually just ruin the dish.  The service here is on point, maybe it was because we were the only people in the restaurant but it was still great, very attentive and friendly so great job. Now down to the price, on happy hour its a decent price but almost everything we ate was not on the happy hour so the bill was still pricey but average. Overall i want to like this place but my girlfriend was not a fan, but im willing to give this place another try."}
{"text":"There's no way for me to even begin describing this restaurant. I have been here twice so far (and many more to come). I came on a recommendation of a colleague. Each time I was here, I was greeted by the chef/owner, Kevin. If you didn't know, he was trained by Japanese celebrity chef Nobuyuki \"Nobu\" Matsuhisa so you know he's a big deal.  Anyway, I was suggested the 7 course meal by the chef himself. If I go into details, this review will never end. Here's the summary of what my experience was. It was amazing! Vegas has some stunning restaurants, but this is my absolute go to place. I can easily say it's my favorite restaurant in Sin City.   There is no quality place where the owner will be your chef and server at the same time. As he brought out each course for us, it progressively became more exquisite. The 6th course is their flagship dish. That plate had a sliced filet, cooked medium rare topped with a generous portion foie gras and bone marrow. That plate absolutely blew me away. There were so many different flavors going on at the same time and it all complimented each other very well.  Before I left the restaurant, I was already thinking about what to order the next time I make a trip to Las Vegas. This place is a hidden gem. I see big things happening real soon."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time last night and all the dishes we ordered were amazing. Great Japanese flavor and some fusion tastes I've never had before were facinating. It was happy Hour then, so we could try many different items on the menu cheaply. I also want to compliment on decors on food especially that yellow sauce on yak-udon. It makes  dishes look even more delicious. I would definitely go back for more food."}
{"text":"Due to my favorite sushi spot being closed early on Sunday's.  I took it up to Yelp to help with our sushi or sashimi cravings. I've been wanting to try Japaneiro out for awhile since they appeared to have good reviews and their pictures of their food got my attention. However; My husband, daughter and I had high expectations and we came out disappointed.   At about midnight there were only 2 tables that were dining so we were seated inside right away. They had specials written on a chalk board. The restaurant isn't big, they have openings for seating outside or inside. It was a little hard to the server's his attention first since he appeared to have a table of frequent diners. They seemed to know each other, talking and laughing luridly but once we got his attention, he was helpful and answered all my questions since we mentioned that we were first timers.   We ordered pretty much everything on the Happy Hour Menu. Their main menu only had 2 pages, there weren't many options and little description. My husband ordered a NY Steak as his main dish.  A. For presentation. The pictures are deceiving, the portions sizes are definitely small.  C. They were a bit bland.   A. For service. There   A. For having a Happy Hour menu.  I think Japaneiros is pretty much a tapas place so I could understand the portions. However, for my husbands NY steak, we were a little confused if his plate was already brought out or if it were the beef from the Happy Hour or his main course due to the portion lacking in size. I asked the server and he said he already had brought out the NY steak. My husband and I just looked at each other in shock disbelief. My favorite dishes was the scallops and the rock shrimp were my husband and daughters favorite.  With the amount we paid, we walked out content and headed to the gas station for some snacks. We could have spent the same amount elsewhere and walk out with full bellys. My husband and I try to live a healthy lifestyle but we also believe in treating ourselves once in awhile. I'm sorry to say that we won't be returning, but please don't let my review discourage you from eating here."}
{"text":"This is the new spot for cooked Japanese fusion                   So today I'm here for my 5 times and it's time to talk about the food well I love it. My favorite is the bone marrow. Or the foie gras either for under $20. I want to make this my regular spot do I keep coming back again and again waiting for them to get the alcohol license. In the mean time they do have a liberal bring your own bottle policy, the chef (Kevin) always comes out to check how each creation was.   This is the only late night spot for miles down the street from soho and a different menu than them   Always take a picture of the specials board right as you walk in its the best values here  Happy japaneiroing"}
{"text":"Despite all the rave reviews I read on Japaneiro, I was still in no rush to visit. The location didn't seem very appealing.   On an early Saturday evening we arrived and were seated quickly. The restaurant was pretty empty and the music was blaring. The menus didn't consist of many options, a majority of their specials are vaguely listed on a chalkboard near the entrance. Make sure you snap a picture so you don't end up standing up blocking the aisle while you decide what to eat.  Service was friendly and attentive but nothing from the specials or the menu had me too excited. We decided on a good assortment of items and waited for the onslaught of food.  The first round consisted of the rock shrimp that were a table favorite. I think I was the only person that didn't enjoy this dish. The flavors were a little sweet for my taste and I've had better versions with more spice and flavor elsewhere.   Of the dishes we tried the standouts for me were the bone marrow filet, prawns and the octopus. The rest of the items were good but forgettable.   We closed out our meal with several dishes from the dessert menu. All were perfunctory but needless to say, I was not wowed by a single one. The addition of red cabbage to the mochi dish still leaves me puzzled.  The pricing was a bit confusing on the chalkboard and most of the menu was a little pricy considering the awkward off strip location and the lack of inventiveness.  I enjoyed many things about the meal, but j don't see myself coming back to Japaneiro."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's hidden in the corner of warm springs and Tenaya so if you don't look carefully you might miss it. The ambience is very pretty and the service is impeccable. I love how at the end of each meal each time we have gone there the chef comes out to introduce himself and conversed with us about how we liked our dinner. The food is great and happy hour is even sweeter. I highly recommend the salmon ceviche and truffle marrow filet. They actually allowed us to get s truffle marrow with filet mignon for $8 more than the regular price of the truffle marrow but it was worth every penny!"}
