{"text":"Came in for the 3-5pm happy hour of 20% off- as listen on their sign. But when ordering I find out it's only certain items- even if I wanted to purchase more expensive items. And they were out of most Japanese beers. Not-so-happy hour."}
{"text":"This place isn't quite as bad as implied by some of the reviews, but it's not that great either. Last night, I had the soft shell crab appetizer and the unagi don (grilled eel on rice). The soft shell crab was pretty good but the eel was mediocre. We tried to order ice cream for dessert but the server completely forgot about it. We had to catch a show, so we ended up leaving without the ice cream.

I was surprised to learn from other reviews that diners can get a 10% discount if they show RTH tickets. My partner and I have been coming to this place for years (it's our go-to place before attending events at Roy Thomson Hall), but nobody ever mentioned this to us."}
{"text":"I came here because I used to lunch here a lot when I worked around this area, it used to be called Sei Sushi (the menu is still the same but quality has diminished to very food court or supermarket quality. For this price I recommend going somewhere else nearby."}
{"text":"Another King Street sushi spot bites the dust. Too bad.

I knew of Oniwa's troubles from when it previously rebranded a few years back, but I doubt that even a name change could have helped it.

Oniwa was a decent, but somewhat underwhelming, sushi restaurant in the city core. Despite being right across the street from a major venue, it never seemed to shake off its \"hole-in-the-wall\" status. Every time I went, the place just never seemed to be that busy. Despite the food being generally good, the biggest failing was the price point.

I used to come here for bento boxes, which were pretty much the only halfway-filling dish on the menu. The tempura vegetables were always light and the portion size was usually just right for me. A la carte options always seemed to be expensive, and I remember that on one of the occasions that I visited during the Toronto International Film Festival, one of the managers sheepishly admitted that a type of fish they served was imitation meat when a friend asked them about it. The miso soup was almost always uniformly salty and underwhelming, like they were trying to compensate for it being stale by overloading it with other ingredients to mask the taste. 

The best part of the place was the decor, which made you feel like you were in a quaint Japanese garden. I always opted for this restaurant above others because I enjoyed sitting beside the fountain.

In the end, I'm somewhat saddened that Oniwa couldn't make a go of it, but not entirely unsurprised. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"This restaurant really didn't do anything for me. The overall atmosphere was pretty drab and not very memorable. The food was OK, but there was nothing special about it...especially for being overpriced. I was disappointed, like in Dishan's experience, my tea was never refilled. I love green tea when I go to sushi restaurants, so them not offering me a refill was really a bummer.   

Also, I found it strange that for being located in a popular area how empty the restaurant was. Usually that is not a good thing, especially in downtown Toronto. For the amount of money my meal was, I know a lot of other sushi restaurants I will go to instead. Overall, I was disappointed and will not be going back here again."}
{"text":"Crappiest teriyaki. I really thought a Japanese restaurant couldn't screw this up, but they did, big time.
The teriyaki sauce is just brown sugar sauce with no Taste.  The rice was soggy.  And is way too sweet and thick."}
{"text":"It is with a slightly heavy heart that I give Oniwa 2 stars, they have friendly staff, a cute little restaurant and a very good location but their food is not worth their bumped up prices (probably due to their location) and in a city riddled with sushi joints that serve similar or better quality sushi for cheaper I can't in my right mind give them the honour of 3 stars. 

Saying that however, I should note that on my last visit there I was given a 20% discount (since it was before 5pm) and that really helped my $19 sushi dinner. Disclaimer: I did come in here after having watched \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" so there was no way I was going to leave satisfied regardless. 

My miso soup tasted horribly \"concentrated\", salad was OK but the aforementioned sushi was pretty flaky which I hate, and my green tea was never refilled until I asked it to be when they came to bring my bill. 

I would say walk a block or two and check out the other sushi restaurants in the area, there are a couple that are pretty good for a few dollars more though."}
{"text":"A friend of mine came here for a quick bite to eat before heading to the theatre. We were both struck by the decoration. It has this lovely Japanese garden feel which was very unexpected and very charming. As for the food? It was very tasty. The fish was fresh, and they sure don't skimp on the spicy sauce. Value for money is pretty good too considering a King Street restaurant.

The only disappointment was that they were completely out of red wine, which was unfortunate. They also never checked to see if we had theatre tickets and were in a rush (thankfully we came early enough that we weren't), which seemed odd considering most other restaurants in the area do, but thankfully the restaurant wasn't too busy and we had plenty of time.

I definitely would come back again."}
{"text":"We went to this Sushi restaurant (which is across from Roy Thompson Hall) on a Saturday evening. It was dead. I think there may have been 3 or 4 tables occupied in the entire place. 

Overall the atmosphere was interesting. The dining area is situated in the bottom of an open arboretum type space where the offices above look down into it. There is also a neat garden with a stone pathway that you must walk through to reach you seat.

As for the sushi, it wasn't bad. But it looked kind of lifeless, dry and drab. I can't recommend this place to any sushi fan. 

The wasabi did seem stronger than I was used to (if that floats your boat)

{"text":"So went here today on Monday for a $10 bento box and apparently their menu has items that aren't included. It states that you get three pieces of yam maki with every Bento box but it's not included apparently if you get certain ones. After asking about it and asking if I was going to be receiving that they blatantly said nope it's not supposed to be on the menu and I'm the first to notice it. I asked to speak to the chef or  manager and they said if I didn't want it I didn't have to pay or eat anything ... so instead of giving me three pieces as it's listed on the menu they would take a hit for an entire Bento box in the garbage. 

Needless to say their customer service is ridiculous. 

I would have gladly given zero stars if I was an option"}
{"text":"The sushi were really good, I did not expect that. The place is really nice with \"garden\" like atmosphere. The waitress was really friendly and the food arrived fast.
I suggest you try salmon sake sushi, really good."}
{"text":"Me and some co-workers went to Sei for lunch today. I'm so mad about the price, I decided to submit a quick review vefore getting back to work. The nutshell: ok food that is expensive.  

I ordered Salmon and Tuna, but specifically asked that it not be spicy. Why did I get spicy Tuna? Don't know. 

The decor is nice."}
{"text":"I don't know why so many bad reviews. I was actually intimidated to come here but my favorite Indian restaurant (Kama) was closed at that time.
So I ordered Miso soup and 2 sushi rolls. The service was fast and attentive. I enjoyed the sushi, it was not swimming in rice (that's what I was afraid of!) and I was happy about my choice.
It was not the best sushi I ever had but it was really tasty and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Terrible food and pricey for what they have. I got the teriyaki chicken dinner. The chicken tastes like cardboard, edges were hard, it's like 2 days old and they just microwaved it and threw some sauce on top. Do not recommend! You can find way better Japanese restaurants with better price too."}
{"text":"Horrible beef teriyaki. Nightmare. Every slice of the beef was chewy (think plastic) and gristly. Based on my extensive experience of Toronto Sushi restaurants, this was by far the worst in terms of beef/ food quality."}
{"text":"I agree that the food quality was pretty poor given the high price, but I guess that's normal for food along king street in the financial district. 

although, the atmosphere was very very pretty, a walk along a stone walkway and plants around to get to your table. 

would probably not come here again unless I'm seriously craving sushi of any kind and happen to be stranded in this area."}
{"text":"Decor was nice and located near theatres but fish was not fresh. Would not visit again unless I was desperate. Pricey and mediocre quality."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I had the chicken teriyaki. They have a Saturday bento brunch. I'll be back for that."}
{"text":"I agree completely with Richard's review.  Same Saturday night emptiness, although we were there after a Lightbox film, and this seemed to be the closest Sushi joint on the strip as we braved  cold and windy weather.  Even so, they seemed a bit loathe to seat us, claiming they would be closing in another 45 minutes. A half hour later however, they opened to a boisterous party of a dozen 20-somethings at the very next table(s), who also seemed surprised they were so close by in an empty restaurant and apologized for disturbing us. 

The food? Well, the soups were very tasty (high salt, which I love, but isn't for everyone), my guy said his seafood salad was fine, if rather miniature in size, but my three hand rolls tasted as though they had been made hours ago and left standing.  I was tempted to use the line in Defending Your Life--\"you sure this wasn't made for someone else?\"  With a sushi restaurant on nearly every block in this city, we really don't have to settle for fishy-tasting fish that is dry around the edges.

I would have returned the hand rolls but for the fact that they had said they were closing soon.  Then of course they were too busy preparing at least a dozen different rolls and drinks for our neighbours.  Really, the only reason they get 2 stars is for being open at all to satisfy that sushi craving, and for their elaborate little Japanese garden decor, complete with bored goldfish.  On my way back to the car I recalled the exuberance of Ed Mirvish' restaurants in that same area with nostalgia."}
{"text":"Blehhhh..I really should have checked the reviews before I stopped in here for take out. 

I landed in Toronto late Monday night and after checking into the hotel I decided to walk around and grab take out rather than waiting on room service - 

The signage looked intriguing but I should have been discouraged by the fact that there were NO ONE in the restauarant. 

I ordered a combo dinner --total disappointment. Nothing looked or tasted fresh. The suhi rice tated slimy..

I am still kicking myself that I didn't check the reviews beforehand.."}
{"text":"Worst experience!!! Horrible staff, rude got my order wrong bad warm sushi, please don't go and waste your money there"}
