{"text":"We have been eating here for about 5 years.  It started out as excellent and has slowly desended to terrible.  Last night will be our final visit.  We sat at the (not busy) sushi bar, were greeted immediately by the sushi chef, then waited 15 to 20 minutes for someone/anyone to take our drink order.  Finally I went to the bar to get drinks.  When i arrived another patron said \"good luck getting a drink here\".  I was ignored by the (not that busy) bartender as he put liquor bottles away, cleaned up etc for another 10 minutes.  This bar has a history of poor service.  Whoever manages the bar should be fired.  When I returned my wife said that when I left the sushi chef notified someone that we were being ignored.  Later Erin came over, apologized for the invisible waitress and offered to take over.  The sushi was good, the sushi chefs were excellent and Erin really cared.  Unfortunately, as other Yelpers have noted, the drink and food servers mostly do not care so we will go where we are more appreciated."}
{"text":"Love  sushi, my mom and I always try to eat here when she is in town. Just keep in mind they are closed after 2pm and open up later."}
{"text":"Worst place ever if you're pregnant. Refuses to make sushi for pregnant women. 

Normally it is a premier tepanyakki restaurant. However, this is the first time eating here while my wife is pregnant and they refused to make sushi for her that is safe for pregnant women."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for the first time today and had a bad experience.  My son and I wanted teppanyaki that's why we went this place.  We were seated at a table and was combined with two gentlemen so that they only have turn on one stove.  At first, it was all right with me since they were trying to conserve gas.   We sat there for a long time and nobody came to cook and finally the waitress told us(including the two gentleman) that we had to move to the other room without the teppanyaki.  So, the cooked food was delivered.  When I asked why they moved us, the waitress said that it's because we only ordered one plus the two gentlemen's.  Apparently, they would not turn on the stove for 3 orders.  As we were leaving, I saw one gentleman in the teppanyaki area and he was being served there.  Very bad service. It seems to me they are selective as to who they want to serve.  I would never ever go back to this place and don't recommend it either."}
{"text":"Our family love sushi. We always eat here when we have friends visiting us. Teppanyaki was great and food was great!"}
{"text":"We went here tonight for what used to be a good experience and ok food.  Well, the food was still ok but the experience was horrible.  They now charge an extra 2.50 per guest for fried rice instead of steamed rice and we were there for less than 45 minutes before we had no less than 5 different people ask if we needed boxes , even being lied to by our waitress that they did not have dessert.  Clearly our reservation at 6pm had to end by 7pm for them to cram more customers in there.  Horrible ambience with ok food and rude team."}
{"text":"Ah-some!!!! The food was delicious, and the table-side grill show was incredible! The chef is really interactive with the table which makes it all worth it! I only have it 4 stars because I felt the chicken could have been better but it was an amazing dinner and great show!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner on July 4.  It was not very busy.  We ordered our usual teppenyaki dish with a double serving of the fried rice.  Our table side chef seemed to be on the old side with one foot in the grave.  He was very slow and not very showmanship while the chef next to us had people laughing and involved in the show.  The food was good and we will probably come back as we like this place better than benihana.  We just will ask for a different table chef."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident.  Didn't know what we'd find, but loved what we did.  Staff was warm and friendly, and we sat with a fun crowd.  Food was perfect.  Best lobster I've ever had.  We're so ready to go back, with a crowd of family and friends next time.  Maybe a couple of birthdays coming up soon would be ideal."}
{"text":"The best food ever!!! Brandon is the chef to request he puts on a great show. The steak was so good... It melted in my mouth. Also the shrimp is great. Service was amazing and they were fun to talk with. Give this place a shot you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Beware of bait an switch. This place deserves ZERO stars. Came on a Sunday. Ordered of the lunch menu that was given to us. After placing the order, the waitress told us there is no lunch special on Sunday, and the prices were triple. They wouldn't honor the lunch prices or apologize for the mistake. We left without eating. Asked to speak to a manager and there no manager on duty, which was a lie because I saw him there. The waitress was a total b***h!!!"}
{"text":"We are new to the neighborhood and were looking to have sake and some delicious teppanyaki! We tried several places in Scottsdale on a Saturday night and they either were an hour wait or didn't take reservations! So we decided to do local with a party of 7! We walked in at 930PM when they close at 11, they sat us, and had the best experience we've ever had at a teppanyaki place!! The staff was efficient, accommodating, and friendly! Wonderful experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a \"fun\" place to take our 3 little boys (ages 6 and under), and keeping 3 of them entertained while waiting for food is the last thing we want to do.  But I remembered Ah-So from years ago, and decided we'd give it a shot at entertaining 3 crazy boys.  And, it sure did.  Our chef knew exactly what they wanted to see - fire, fireballs, and more fire.  The \"show\" he put on was awesome - including the encore where he lit up the entire perimeter of the grill and juggled batons of fire in the middle.  It was frickin' cool.  Never before have my kids ever been so entertained while eating at a restaurant!  They still talk about going there every day.  

Oh yah, and the food was great too!"}
{"text":"Boston roll was pretty good, but the Teppanyaki was great. Brendan was our table chef. He made an excellent meal and entertained the entire table. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place, by far is my favorite place in town to eat. Hands down. I'm not saying who the best chef is. He's hard enough to get as it is. Based on extensive experience. ;)"}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive at first, the soup and salad weren't great, but it was such a fun place and the food for the main course was excellent. I had shrimp that was so tender and flavorful and my husband loved his steak.  Our chef  Brandon was amazing, it was a blast to watch him flip food and the cooking utensils. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Took my mom here for the food they cook in front of you (beni-hana style? Not sure of the correct term). The cook was a joy to watch, the food was good - we both had the sirloin. The portions a bit smaller than I have had in the past, but delicious. My sister swears by their sushi, but I'll let her write her own review!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to Ah so for years. Always good good. Request Brandon. He is their best Chef by far."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday and was the first one there.

A friendly lady welcomed us and sat us in a teppanyaki table. A family of four showed up and shared the table with us.

We had edamame, veggie tempura, and shrimp and filet lunch.

We could skip the tempura.

The food was good, above average but nothing impressive.

The down part is that the chef barely did an effort to impress. I like to go to that kind of places for the show since I'm pretty picky when it comes to Japanese food. And if there's no show at all... 

Also the bidding feels old. It feels like going into a 1980's restaurant (I guess that's what they fueled back in the day, I'll ask my grand ma, ha ha).

Decent food, decent prices, no show (at least in my visit)"}
{"text":"We met up with another couple for dinner and sat at the bar side. Sushi was delicious! We had the 8 piece sashimi, red dragon rolls, dragon rolls, Las Vegas rolls, Philly rolls, and octopus salad. Everything was so good. The only one that was just mediocre was the Philly roll. Service was excellent! Everyone was very nice there! I would definitely recommend to all my friends to go back! I was too busy talking with company... The only picture I took was our drinks while we were waiting! Lol!"}
{"text":"The people are really nice, but the environment was quite smokey at lunch. The chicken was of a strange chewy texture. The variety on the lunch special was nice and the price was good. Unfortunately, I would likely not return due to the cooking smoke."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Even though it was not crowded when we went in, we were met with enthusiasm, great service & a smile!
The food was amazing, the teppanyaki was so fun to watch, and at no time did we feel like the service was lacking.
The food was very fresh, including the scallops that I ordered. The scallops were cooked perfectly.
We had edemame, gyoza dumplings, a rainbow roll, saki bombs... The works!
There was not one part of our experience that was lacking anything.
I'll never drive to benihana'd again just to wait in line, when this neighborhood gem is waiting for our business!
SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love the sushimen at Ah-So. They are so awesome and friendly.
Try the Las Vegas roll or the Monsoon. They are to die for."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi platters here at AH-SO. Great food and great company. Definitely recommend if you're into sushi or trying new foods. 10/10"}
{"text":"Tepenyaki was great!  Our chef was awesome, food was great (especially the fried rice).  Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. Went for my kids birthday and they didn't even offer a dessert or to sing happy birthday you would think they would offer that but no never going back. The server was not attentive we did lunch on a Sunday and they charge dinner all day which was fine but make sure you check your bill I ordered two kids steaks and they were charging me regular price for them smh."}
{"text":"Went last weekend with a few friends and we dined at one of their Teppanyaki tables.  The waitress took forever to come to our table but, once she did, the service got better.  Ordered some sushi which came out timely and was good.  Table service by the chef was entertaining.  My scallops were very good.  He overcooked the chicken.  Wife liked her steak and shrimp.  Overall the food was good but I doubt I will ever be back.  It was sooooo hot in the restaurant that we couldn't really enjoy the evening.  I have been there three times now and it's always too hot.  Complaining to manager didn't get any results."}
{"text":"Love this place. The service is excellent. Your drinks are refilled promptly and the staff always has a smile on their faces. The food is really good and I have never had a problem here. I wish I could eat here every day."}
{"text":"Amazing I never had chinese food before when I went here I had Chinese food for the first time"}
{"text":"Had some wonderful sushi! 911 roll, Nude roll, Hawaiian roll and a simple tuna roll. All fantastic. Kind service. Pleasing environment. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"For me Ah So is just so so. In Arizona it appears that teppanyaki has become extremely popular and extremely competitive. There's Ichiban, Kyoto, Ah So, a few others and of course Benihana. So, when there are quite a few venues that offer the same dining experience, you would think that you would want to do something that stands out. Unfortunately,Ah So hasn't quite figured that out.

The quality of meat and seafood are just ok. Their fried rice is good but it's missing someone I can't quite put my finger on. The service is alright and if you get lucky, you'll get a great chef but you have to get lucky. There is really no consistency. Also, this Ah So is a little run down and dingy. For the price, I'd rather spend a few dollars more and head over to Benihana where the chefs are consistent, the restaurant is clean, the atmosphere is great, and the quality of the food is a bit better."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for many years and today my family brought me here to celebrate fathers day. Great food and ambiance."}
{"text":"Let me start this section off by stating the fact that I mean no harm to this business nor anyone that works here.  Getting straight into it,  me and my boyfriend came here for lunch one day and ordered the special and a couple more rolls and drinks.    As we are sitting down the original sushi chef Heath was fantastic and took care of us and took proper hygienic steps to reassure the food met food safety requirements.   But another sushi chef came by shortly after and without even washing his hands, began handling our food with his bare hands.  If that didn't disgust you enough yet,  he proceeded to walk away drinking a beer while behind the sushi counter while still in the kitchen. At this point, we both lost our appetite.  Never returning here for sushi here again solely because of this specific experience and I'd highly advise you not to either unless you don't mind some random man, manhandling your raw fish...   food safety =0."}
{"text":"Today was 110 degrees so I decided to come here on my lunch for something to cool my tastebuds. Sushi!! I haven't had it in such a long time.

Jesus. This was the first time I've ever gagged while I was trying to eat sushi. Actually I'm going to make a list because there's just so many things that are wrong on so many levels. This review is based soley on sushi bar experience, i didn't try the teppanyaki.

1. Walking in, it smelled. I mean, it smelled like old, mothballs or mold growing. I almost walked out but had the guts to keep going.

2. No hostess around. Apparently they only have one waitress/hostess running Friday at Lunch time. A big no no. Chef Jimmy invited me to sit at the sushi bar.

3. I ordered #1, the 'Beef Teriyaki with Tempura' bento box, but instead of saying that mouthful,  I said \"I'd like to order #1\". Sushi chef Jimmy says, \"Tempura?\" I said, \"Yes.\" 

Can you see where this miscommunication is leading to? Yup, my bento box was just Tempura, no beef. Sigh. I've also ordered a side of California rolls, Cucumber rolls, and Salmon Nigiri. So for his mistake, he insisted on comping the Salmon Nigiri.

4. The sushi that I mentioned above were awful. The rice in the Cucumber & California rolls were doughy and not fresh. I tried as hard as I could to keep chewing and swallow, but I swear I almost threw up in my mouth. What happened?! I didn't even touch the Salmon Nigiri since it seriously looked like someone smashed both pieces with their hands.. very old looking as well. 

5. The only reason this place gets a star is because Jimmy is nice and we had a great conversation. But I'm sorry, something is wrong with warm, super doughy and unpresentable sushi.

It's gonna take some serious convincing to come back here. My stomach turned over several times before I could finish writing this review."}
{"text":"Food was good and wait staff was attentive, but there was no \"show\" with the meal as I've come to expect. No talking, banter or tricks--a disappointing experience when I wanted to show off teppan for someone who hasn't seen it before. I know the place was empty, but if you don't feel like doing a show for a small group, then say as much and redirect a guest to the dining area. Very disappointed in what I am used to being an excellent time."}
{"text":"Food from the grill good. Sushi was absolutely horrible, esp the eel sauce on the caterpillar. Yuck
Not to mention they charged a 15% grat to a party of 5... seriously?  3 adults, 1 child tepanki,  I had sushi. Never come here... I  knew it was bad the first time I tried it. Yuck
Server was horrible... had no idea the difference between a Pinot nior and a Pinot Grigio... come on, your a server! Smh"}
{"text":"I have loved their food since I was really little and I'm always happy to go, the soup that comes with your food is to die for, you really can't go wrong with their teppenyaka menu. The group atmosphere is fun and interesting. I honestly have nothing negative to say, the staff is always welcoming, attentive and nice. I don't eat much sushi here, when the show is at the grill. Maybe I'm idealizing it a bit but I honestly think anyone could benefit from trying this place"}
{"text":"We had a pretty bad experience. We sat around the grill and only liked the fried rice...even though it was missing onion! :/ Our chef was doing sake bombs while he cooked our meal which I found incredibly unprofessional! Also, the soup was just plain gross!"}
{"text":"This is an absolute must try!! My first visit and I definitely will be back, my husband and I date night was perfect. Thanks Sky, who was very attentive to our grill/table and my margarita was one of the best I've had in Az."}
{"text":"Great food and fun atmosphere. I highly recommend  the special for $59 for two. Steak (upgrade to filet for $4 extra, per person), scallops, shrimp and lobster.....plus fried rice, soup, salad and edamane. These aren't small portions either!!"}
{"text":"Best teppanyaki! The food is amazing, and great service! 

Must try: Gilbert Town Sushi"}
{"text":"I love this place! We come here so much its like Norm walking into Cheers. They have great Sushi and the food is awesome. If you haven't been here you got to try it once. If you try it you will fall in love with how friendly they are here. Come see how good it is!"}
{"text":"More expensive than most of the sushi places in Mesa. They make the rolls look normal sized by adding extra rice using very little fish. I would not go back, very poor value."}
{"text":"I enjoyed some teppanyaki today for a birthday luncheon and we were treated like royalty. Staff is very kind and food was fresh and perfectly prepared. (Make sure to speak up if you want your scallops or shrimp rare vs. well done.) 

Great all around experience."}
{"text":"Good food.  I like the sushi side better than the teppanyaki side, but if you're in the mood for teppanyaki it's not bad."}
{"text":"I want so bad to like Ah-so as much as the other tappenyaki places but no matter how many times I come back I'm just not impressed. Don't get me wrong. The staff was very nice, all of the elements were there but it just seemed like everyone was simply going through the motions.  I like it, I just don't love it. I was, however, very pleased with the Philly roll."}
{"text":"Five star all the way! Always had great service in Yuma and decided to try this location. We were not disappointed. Wonderful service and awesome food. We felt like we were eating with friends."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Loved the show.  Loved the fact that I could make reservations here on Valentine's Weekend. Steak and Shrimp are mouth watering. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I am not sure why but I cannot go to Sushi without making it a drink fest. Saki bombers are naturally my drink of choice and I was happy when the menu said a large Kirin Ichiban and Saki was only $5.75. Ah-So has no happy hour, which is rare with Sushi Restaurants, but considering most who do have happy hour prices generally start at $6 for a bomber. 

Soon after we ordered a few sushi rolls, the server brought out complimentary Miso soup. It was appreciated on a cool winter night. 

After awhile our sushi arrived and it tasted fresh, my favorite being a scallop roll that cannot be missed.  The service was attentive for the most part even though it was a busy Friday night. 

Teppanyaki tables are available for the less adventurous palate."}
{"text":"I'm sorry Michael visited on a \"bad night\" but we've only had great experiences with Ah-So. The chefs are entertaining and friendly, and the atmosphere is nice enough for dates or out-of-town guests, yet casual enough for families. The teppanyaki is truly as much about the show as the dinner. And speaking of dinner, it is worth the trip alone."}
{"text":"Great place for teppanyaki here in Gilbert/Mesa. Friendly faces and a great show put on by the chefs. It's a lot of food if you choose to go for the grill. The sushi is great too! Las Vegas, tootsie, and Arizona rolls are my favorite. Location is great right on baseline and Gilbert. Haven't been to their other locations, but this one is great."}
{"text":"Ah-So in Gilbert had been a favorite family destination for that special event for years. After the little \"event\" that closed down the Teppan portion of Sakana in Chandler, Ah-So was the nearest Teppan option for a while.  There are now closer options, but for my daughter's 5th birthday we fiegured we'd go with a tried and true favorite.

Bad choice. 

I'm not sure what happened, but Ah-So was as uninspiring as you can get for a Teppan Grill. Our Sushi appetizer was extremely ordinary, the yellowtail seemed dry and tasteless. Our chef had absolutely no personality, he somehow did not make enough fried rice to go around (and didn't realize it until he tried to fill the last bowl), they seemed to skimp on the veggies, and while they main course was good, when you pay $17 and up for something you would like to see a bit more.

I'm not sure if I caught them on a bad night, but considering the number of better places I have to pass to get there, I will be saying Sayonara to Ah-So."}
{"text":"Well, we were invited for a night out by some friends.  We arrived 20 minutes early and decided to sit in the bar and have a drink.  MISTAKE.  We were totally ignored - realized there was no bartender, just waitresses getting their drinks for tables seated for teppan.

When our friends arrived, we were seated and then it got good.  We had a terrific grill cook, David, and met so many friendly people like J and JC (Chang).  Our drinks never hit bottom, and we had so much food, we ended up with boxes. 

David was funny and our steak, shrimp, scallops and chicken were delicious.  The edemame was served HOT and salted, the california roll was good, too.  We did enjoy some Saki bombs, and learned a little Korean.  Although this is a Japanese restaurant, it is run by Koreans.  (we have a family friend who is particular about this).

Please take note that for dinner we were served a broth soup (I don't think it was Miso), small salad w/soy dressing, egg fried rice, and then our entree with veggies.  It is a lot of food!    

We really enjoyed our food and the staff.  Although the place could use a good once (or twice) over for cleaning (especially the bathrooms) - the food was really good!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice and both times have been great!  The chef's aren't usually Japanese, but they do a great job none the less.  The food is wonderful and despite the strip mall exterior, the inside is nice.  It's way better than Benihana in my opinion."}
{"text":"I have lived in So California in the LA area since the early 60s and love sushi, teppanyaki and regular Japanese food. One of my disappointment in moving to the Phoenix area had been the shortage of good ethnic food.

We were on our way to Pollo Loco and spotted this restaurant and decided to try it. 

The lunch crowd was sparse ( two other tables other than us).

My wife ordered the tempura bento dish (tempura shrimp and veggies with a basic vege crab roll. Tempura was greasy and the sauce was not your regular tempura sauce of vinegar, mirin sauce and daikon). It was very disappointing.

I ordered a soft shell crab roll and it was also disappointing . The eel sauce was bitter (probably from burnt sugar) and too salty. I ate 2  of the four pieces served as it was way too salty and bitter. Never found the soft shell crab.

I also ordered the chicken katsu and the chicken was dry and overcooked. Ate half of what I ordered because I was hungry. I make my own katsu (pork and chicken) and use a Fry's katsu sauce ( I normally use Kikkoman). I don't understand why Ah-So cant even copy that. The vegetable stir-fry that came with the dish, again, was too salty and too soggy.

Our bill came to $38 including tip.

Not trying this place again."}
{"text":"When you want to know where to go for poor customer service this place is the perfect definition of it.  Never again will i step foot after our first and last visit to this horrid establishment. Customer service in my eyes plays a HUGE Role. If you are treated poorly what is the purpose to come back with their food not being anything amazing as well. We had come to this establishment for sushi night and sake bombs for the boys.  Their small sake bottle they give you with a huge bottle of beer to match but doesnt match really because theres maybe 2-3 shots worth of sake and the beer with sake should be about 5-8 shots rather than 2-3.  After waiting for our food for a good amount of time passed our huge amount of food ordered came out and was decent but not for the price we paid.  Not A Deal! What so ever.  So as we are still having a good time eating and talking to one another about random things and what not, my boyfriend got up to look at something on the TV since it was close by but not close enough for him to see what the score was on a game so as he got up to look the restaraunt was closing up and we were the last 2 couples in the place putting money in their pockets for the day; the owner or manager in a little button up tommy bahama type looking short asian man had gone up to my boyfriend and said CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?! Very rudely said, and my boyfriend responded No, i was just checking the score. The Manager basically cut him off and said WELL THEN LETS GO! so my boyfriend came back to the table and had said i think they want us to go so we closed our check and had hurried as fast as we could. I understand when establishments close it is time to go!  But if its a mom and pop shop or restaraunt i believe in more or better customer service in order to get a tip.  I do not believe i have to tip over 15% if i was treated poorly. My boyfriend is too nice when it comes to tips in my opinion i believe people need to work for their money and just not expect so much from people if they don't try hard enough.  You treat me poorly i don't return or i excpect an apology of some sort.  If not you can expect no more money from my bank account.  

Their food and service what we paid for was ridiculous. I Will Never Ever Return. I Hope they Shut down. I think if a wait staff is really nice we would have been treated better then this on our first time here.  For what we paid i could have gotten triple the food in other place i know of. And as far as portions go 3/4 of the people that went including myself were still hungry leaving."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for a Teppanyaki lunch. It was one of the best I have had in a long time. The chef Hideo was fantastic,funny, and knowledgeable. The wait staff was fabulous. The food was cooked perfect and it was delicious. While I can't have sushi, my wife and roommate did. They both said it was great. This place is worth the price."}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE!! I went last night and the food and service was horrible. I ordered sushi and it came out wrong. That's ok but then the server tried to argue that what she brought was what I ordered. Which was a sushi roll with cream cheese and a different fish than what I asked. My husband gave it back after going back and forth, 10 mins go by and she comes back with THE SAME SUSHI ROLL AS BEFORE. I told her, \"this is the same roll you brought out before I can see the salmon, I asked for the calamari roll\" and she keep saying it was the calamari roll then I pointed to the salmon and said \"this is salmon. I asked for calamari\". And she kept saying it was calamari! I  almost lost it, then I said. No. It's the same roll because I can see salmon and where my husband picked it up. 
Run clear of this place. The food and service are horrible, spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Bummer to see poor reviews for this place, I've been coming here since I was a kid living in Gilbert and absolutely love this place! Love the experience, love the food (easily the best fried rice you will ever eat!). The filet and all of the sea food is amazing, chicken is chicken, skip it and get the fancier stuff. And the sushi is always great. Love this restaurant. I agree they could use a little sprucing up inside, but the food is delicious and I look forward to coming here every year or so!"}
{"text":"Flames, cheering, humor, welcome to the best Dinner and a Show in the Valley.

Ah-So is the best Teppan experience in the Valley. It has been a Perry family tradition decades. It was and remains the place we celebrate family events and recognition like great grades, graduations, and promotions. We also celebrate days ending in Y at Ah-So. 

We have been here dozens of times. We have always left with that top-of-the-world feeling and satisfied smiles on our faces.

Showmanship & tasty quality are the signature aspects of the Ah-So experience. 

Things we love:
-The cold crisp salad with sesame dressing - Oh My God!
-The Ah-So Special - Steak, Chicken, & Shrimp
-The Chef's Special - Filet Mignon & Lobster
-The friendly caring amazing servers
-The skilled chefs and their humorous expert showmanship
-The amazing dinner & a show experience
-The comraderie - 9 times out of 10 you'll meet some very friendly and entertaining people at your table (on rare occasions you might be seated be folks just wanting to keep to themselves - don't let them keep you from laughing and cheering) 
-Kirin Saki Bomber

I'm not a sushi person, but my son is, as are many friends who join us regularly. The sushi always gets 2 thumbs up.

Have a blast."}
{"text":"Definitely an underlooked gem in Gilbert. To qualify, you have to love Hibachi and you can't be turned off by a \"strip mall\" exterior. 

Food was excellent, the \"show\" was definitely rehearsed, bathrooms were \"meh\" -- I'd almost take off a star for that but after a Kirin Ichiban and a couple of decent vodka tonics, they get the star back. 

They have no deserts, so keep that in mind when bringing the lady or the kiddies. 

Overall, this is a place I will go back to and certainly a place I would bring my friends to."}
{"text":"I prefer this place over Benihana. Both are good but I feel that you get more food for the same price. It's always fun to bring the kids here. I usually get the steak and shrimp and my husband gets chicken and steak. Fun environment and good service."}
{"text":"If I could give this less then 1 star I would. They do not follow basic hygenic food prep rules. We went there and two people at the table ordered the vegetarian typpenyaki. The chef came out then promptly dumped the veggies and raw meat together. When I commented that I was a vegetarian and he was coating the veggies with the fat and blood of the meat he made a snarky comment, wiped the spatula and then promptly used it on steak before touching the veggies. I spoke to the servers and they took my plate to recook my food in the back, to then BRING ME THE SAME PLATE OF FOOD!!! I ended up getting exceptionally sick and everyone at the table was shocked at how it all played out (including 4 which were strangers). At the end the place chastised me for not telling the cook (I did and we had a conversation about it) and took 10% off the bill (not even the cost of the food I couldnt eat). I have been to dozens of japanese places in my life and never as anything like this happened. I strongly discourage anyone from going to this place."}
{"text":"Overall this is a great sushi joint. Fresh, clean, and service is awesome. The prices are a little high but it's worth it."}
{"text":"On my boyfriends 23rd birthday we had a party of 6 arrive here. Very attentive service, owner extremely nice and the chefs very fun. Would definitely recommend Alex! And recommend sharing a meal. It is a $7 up charge but beats paying another $20+ a plate."}
{"text":"Our first visit here was New Years Eve and the place was packed. For me, the whole teppanyaki experience is dated and often times overpriced. The soup( broth) and the salad are a waste of time but the rest of the meal was very good. The portions were bigger than i expected and the fried rice was tastey. We steered clear of alcohol and  seafood and the bill was reasonable at around 50 bucks with tip.
Seafood and drinks...? You can drop a hundy.
I'll have to see if they have a sushi happy hour. Good experience overall and the staff were on their game."}
{"text":"Ok so the sushi is nothing to write home about. Very bland, krab used, and lots of rice used in their rolls. The sashimi is decent but there are definitely better places in the area. The teppanyaki is another story! The fried rice is awesome, its a lot of fun, the steak, chicken and scallops are delicious. It is a bit pricey but very fun. The owner is a nice guy, unfortunately if you don't understand how the tipping works with your teppanyaki cook and they waitress you will be bothered about it. We tipped our teppanyaki cook $40 and our waitress was awful so we only tipped her $15 or $20. She came back to our table and asked if we were unhappy with our service and she even broke down how the tipping was handled with her, the cook and the bus boys. It was very embarrassing and upsetting! That alone has kept me away for almost a year! So sad! So don't over tip the cook, he gets a cut of your waitresses tip."}
{"text":"I had never had Teppan before, so my boyfriend took me to this restaurant for dinner on a weekday evening. We were seated at a table with another guy, who lived nearby and seemed to visit the place often (as gathered from his conversation with the chef). We both ordered the steak and what a great meal it was. I was in awe watching him make the fried rice... awesome. 

Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Probably the best place to take a date to dinner. It is very interactive, the chefs are funny, and the good is fantastic! Their service is great and the ambience is fitting. The one downfall is sometimes you are seated with random people."}
{"text":"Went here last year for hibachi. Food was OK, nothing special. The one thing that made me gag was that they allowed a diner to bring her small lap dog into the restaurant and sit right at the hibachi grill. The dog sat on her lap while they ate. The dog was not wearing a service dog vest so I am lead to believe this was just a pet. Considering sushi is already a risky meal if not done correctly, this incident caused me to lose all trust about health codes in this restaurant."}
{"text":"First,, they sat us down in the wrong section of the restauran,, fuckin Nikita dragun lookin ass,, then the edamame bowl was too small the edamames were overflowing-- I've never seen such poor depth perception ever in my life. The sushi that was ordered separately came on one plate,, and they were tiny. Might as well go to Masa it's literally a mile to the right anyways."}
{"text":"The kids were very excited to eat there, but unfortunately, a gentleman met us at the door at 9:10pm stating they were closed while the sign on the door states thet were open until 10pm. :-("}
{"text":"It's pretty good. Awesome lunch specials, clean, nice staff, no complaints. I go there regularly and haven't had any issues. Their spicy tuna is really good."}
{"text":"Our chief was great. Fun personality and the food was delicious! The waiter was pleasant and drinks were always topped off. My only complaint is that this restaurant is highly overpriced the overall decor is lacking and seems  to be ver outdated. The restroom was very dirty which really put a negative spin on our visit."}
{"text":"ah-so japanese? more like \"ah-so delicious\"!!!!!!

(if that doesnt earn me a \"cool\" or \"funny\" rating, then i dont know what will!)

anyways, one of my hobbies is eating teppanyaki and sushi. not normally in gilbert but i was in the area the other night and wanted some teppan.

maybe the best teppan yet? good prices, delicious filet & scallops, and they actually start cooking the fried rice first! i dont know what some of these other restaurants are thinking when they start making this part last . . . only negative is, no chicken and hardly any veggies in the fried rice but it came free with the meal!

had a vegas roll and it also was delicious. i liked that they spaced out the sushi/soup/salad/entree so they didnt overlap and gave us time to relax and drink sake in between. 

the chef was great. funny and personable (and actually asian, which is a rare thing at these restaurants nowadays) he flipped shrimp at us and drank sake with us after. there was another chef who was white who did not look like nearly as much fun cooking for other tables . . . so much so that i actually remarked \"i hope we dont get that guy as our chef.\"

tons of food, go hungry!"}
{"text":"This place has some solid offerings. We ate on the sushi bar side, and I was quite pleased by what we had. Nothing exceptional, but everything was great. A solid four-star experience (and they even have a few special Hawaiian beers!). I'll definitely come back, for no better reason than it's close to where I live. But I'm pretty sure that I'll never be disappointed, and will always be pleased."}
{"text":"We went here for our friends birthday. They were very sweet and our meal was great. It's a little pricey but it's nothing that isn't terrible. 
The only thing I didn't like was having to be seated next to strangers when you do the teppanyaki side. But honestly that wasn't a huge issue. 
Over all awesome restaurant. Really clean and the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"We love Ah-So in Goodyear, AZ. However this one doesn't even compare. 

1.) we had a 7pm reservation. They were NOT busy when we arrived. It took 15 min to get sat (why make a reservation?) 

2.) After sitting down. The hostess other servers walked by NUMEROUS times. No one asked if we would even like a glass of water. Our boys had played a 3.5 hr baseball game in 109 degree weather. Dying of thirst. Took 45 min from the time we walked in the door to get a drink for them. 

3.) the over head exhaust fan that suck the smoke up from the grill at our table was broken. We had smoke BILLOWING in our faces the entire time the chef was cooking in front of us. 

4.) It was SWELTERING hot inside the restaurant. They didn't have the ceiling fans on...did I mention it was 100 degree still outside?! We asked for them to turn the ac up since #3 was happening. They said it would make the smoke worse. 

5.) the food was not even close to being as good as the Goodyear Ah-So. 

All in all a very poor, but expensive meal $189 (plus $25 tip and not counting drinks we bought at the bar while waiting for our table.)"}
{"text":"I chose Ah So for my birthday celebration after reading good reviews and good word of mouth. I was completely blown away! We had so much fun. We came at 7:30 on a Friday night and it was quiet and not busy. I like a quiet atmosphere so this was perfect for me. The waitress was welcoming and friendly. The chef was hilarious and fun! He got all of us involved in the Teppanyaki experience. Now to the food. The food was just as amazing. I normally don't like fried rice but this rice was delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly. Everyone's food looked great. I just left, and I already want to go back! This place was awesome. Great experience!"}
{"text":"I wanted to take my Mother-in-law out for a nice birthday dinner after work.  We had never been there before, but we had heard that the food was good from friends.  We arrived at 9:29pm, and the hours on the window and their website said they were open until 10pm.  We walked in and saw people eating, but no one was at the front desk.  We waited a few minutes until we finally had to search for someone.  We finally found a lady who worked there and she told us they were closed.  The hours listed should be the hours they serve customers, just like every other restaurant.  It's not as if we walked in just a minute before closing.  They may have good food, but they have terrible customer service.  I will be going taking my business to Benihana from now on."}
{"text":"Not  bad, but not amazing. I ordered the Dragon Roll, and yes it was A-OK. The fish could have been more fresh. For $11.95, the order comes with a side of miso soup. Service is nice and they do have chefs that will throw your food in the air and give you quite a show. Personally, I do not think I will return unless a friend truly wants to come here. Let me tell you something though, if you're a student and want to grab WiFi, you can access WiFi here! Of course, it's from Einstein's Bagel's next door. It's close to the Trader Joe's where I will most likely eat a salad after and study at the Starbucks nearby."}
{"text":"Ok this was our first time there tonight and I had to come home and write a review. They were so nice from the moment we walked in. We waited for our party at the bar. We had a few drinks while waiting.  .  Server was very nice. Very fast. The man who seemed to be the owner was talkative and friendly. 
We then were seated at the table our chef AUSTIN was super nice friendly,talkative and made our table laugh. We looked around and none of the other tables chefs were talkative. But they were doing cool things. Food was beyond AMAZING!!!!! Full of flavor! forget all the other reviews that say bad things. don't let them push you away.  Very good entertainment ! Keep up the good work! And ask for Austin! From Cali! Lol 
So nice!"}
{"text":"This is 4 stars because the Sushi here is always consistant, fresh and good. Hard to say that about a lot of AZ places. The place is old (it's been around a long time), and the wait staff is good. I think some of these reviews confuse ESL speakers as bad wait staff... but that's not fair. We've eaten there about 30 times in the last 6 years or so. They are always nice to us. If you're looking for Morton's or Ruth Chris service, not the place for you. Just a great local Japanese restaurant that has charm. Worth a try."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Ah-So's Teppanyaki, and usually frequented the Peoria location. Unfortunately, this time, the sushi chef sneezed all over his prep area. Without covering his mouth, turning away, or otherwise making an effort to block his bodily fluids from coming in contact with the prep area and RAW seafood. The worst part: he kept prepping. No sanitization.

We pointed it out to the manager as we left, and were made fun of.

Suffice to say, never again."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and the food has always been delicious. I wish the bathrooms looked cleaner.  They have re done the inside of the restaurant a bit which makes it look cleaner and prices are reasonable. I tried another restaurant of this type and was hugely disappointed. It made me look at Ah So in a new light. :-)"}
{"text":"I am so sad, I looked forward to dinner all day after I found this east valley location earlier this week.  It is my husbands birthday so I surprised him.  What a let down.  We love Ah-So in the North Valley and thought this was related.  It SO is not...  The service was terrible, the servers were clearly overwhelmed and it all went downhill from there.  The drinks took forever, and then my order was incorrect.  When I told her, she near argued with me.  Since my husband was the only one that got his food I watched him eat- the vegetables were soft, poor quality overcooked steak and dehydrated shrimp.  He ate only because he hadnt had lunch and it was in front of him.  After 20 more minutes my food still hadnt arrived, we had enough.  Sorry but we will not be back."}
{"text":"Are you looking for the cure for your sushi cravings? Do you wish that you could be permanently rid of your roll addiction? Then look no further than \"Ah-so\"... with their wide array of fetid fish, chewy seaweed, stinky rice and hot sake made from paint thinner. 

This place is guaranteed to exorcise you off of anything remotely Japanese. This is the place that has the owner muttering \"dumb ah-so\" anytime any customer forks out money for their gut wrenching fare. 

After the experience you will be sure to scream \"oh my poor raw ah-so\" as you crawl out  with nary a need to ever go back to associating with anything sushi like in your life"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi & atmosphere! Tried Dragon Roll - excellent taste! Rainbow Roll w/Eel sauce, YUMMMMMYYY! Excellent attentive and quick service!"}
{"text":"We didn't get refills, one of the sauces tasted strangely like lighter fluid, and the cooktop ran out of gas halfway through cooking dinner so he had to finish cooking it somewhere else. The food was delicious though! We went for my brother's birthday but they maybe only acknowledged it once briefly- everywhere we've gone has done dessert or a song or something and we have good memories of celebrating birthdays at Ah-So years and years ago... Tonight's experience just didn't match up to what we remembered."}
{"text":"My husband and I were headed to a different sushi restaurant and got there too late.  I was getting hungry and angry.  We saw this place and tried it.  We were the only ones there on Thursday night after nine pm.   

We sat at the sushi bar.  I love caterpillar rolls.  It has turned into the roll that I judge a place by.  The roll here was alright.  It was good but nothing special.  The December 29th roll was delicious!  The Hubba Hubba roll was good as well.  The sushi chef was an older Asian gent who was nice.

The slight cons were we only ordered one beer and got two.  We should have spoke up since I don't drink but we didn't.  Also it was bit pricey.

We will go here again sometime."}
{"text":"Tried this after seeing the high star count, was not disappointed. Though a bit different from what I'm used to back home the food was really good. Cook was entertaining and very skilled. 
The chicken was the best surprise, so many places coat it terriaki when they cook, this place didn't, making it much lighter. Was a nice change."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, show was lots of fun . Chef did the veggie toss and I caught it on my first try, my daughter was very proud.
Happy Father's Day!!"}
{"text":"i used to take my daughter here when she was a kid, it's the only place she's sit still and watch the teppenyaki chef's do their thing.  That was 25 years ago.
The decor has not changed on bit.
seriouslly, same tables, same chairs and perhaps same people......................
ha ha

I took my grandkids there and they loved the entertainment.
food was good, chef was entertaining, but i couldn't believe how they hadn't changed in 25 years, not even the curtain to the bathroom area.

again, food was good, pricing was fair.
no worries on going there, just not a modern place."}
