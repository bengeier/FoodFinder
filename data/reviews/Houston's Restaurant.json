{"text":"When the have it available, the grilled artichoke app is amazing. The filet is also consistently solid. Great char on it even though I order med rare."}
{"text":"This place has a totally laid back atmosphere and some great food. I went there with two co-workers while I was in Arizona for business. We all couldn't resist the temptation of the cheeseburger. Mine was cooked and seasoned to perfection, and the portion was huge. The fries were kind of like shoe string ones and very thin, which is why I knocked a star off the top. I prefer big steak fries.

The beer list was pretty impressive too. I had a Pacifico and a Heineken Light while we were there.

One warning, the prices can be a little steep. A cheeseburger is $14 and it was the cheapest thing on the menu. The servers were very attentive and I had a great time."}
{"text":"It is better than 3 stars but not quite 4.  They have some pretty good dishes.  The vegi burger was amazing!"}
{"text":"We were at Houston's tonight and the bartender insulted my husband. He had one and a half drinks, we were seated at a table for dinner, my husband stepped up to the bar with our friend Kevin just to have a conversation away from the table and get another drink and the bartender refused to serve him. And the way she did it was very rude and embarrassing. We had already ordered our dinner and they had just brought our appetizers, but after talking to the manager who supported the bartender, we got up and left. Here we are at Sumomaya having a fabulous time. We will NEVER EVER go back to Houston's again and will urge our friends do the same.  I have never seen my husband so insulted and angry as tonight. And it started out so well with my husband having a good time talking to a gentleman named Mark who has been on the board with Bob Bondurant since 1988............you're missing out Houston's........we're here year round when all the snowbirds go back to wherever and ate here regularly......you need a lesson in diplomacy! I would give you a zero but that's not an option."}
{"text":"Here for a conference and tried the cheeseburger, based on a fellow conference attendee's recommendation.  AMAZING!  The fries, I know just from looking, were not good for me...could see the oil on them, but they were still crisp and perfectly seasoned.  I couldn't help but wolf it down.  Will DEFINITELY return on my next trip (or maybe again on this one)!"}
{"text":"Love the fresh squeezed juices for mixing at the bar, a nice touch when you don't expect it.  Good service fair price."}
{"text":"Always satisfying and never a let down!
Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection.
Each steak was juicy and the seared tuna was excellent!
The atmosphere here is comfortable with traditional flare.
A really nice place to spend any meal!"}
{"text":"always great food and friendly staff.  only negative is the wait!  but well worth it.  Want no wait, go across the street to Remington's at the Scottsdale Plaza and pay 3 times the price for poor quality tasteless food and rude and unfriendly staff.  The wait at Houston's is worth it!"}
{"text":"I have had a really great experience here and a really bad one, but this place is your standard for some great food. They have a back patio for you to wait and a cocktail waitress so you can drink while you wait and there is always a wait of at least 20 minutes but if you are with friends you don't really mind. Food was good, service was great!!! An attentive server can really make your night. Luke was his name and he was great. food was good, an okay price point for what we got. Standard."}
{"text":"This has become my 'go to' restaurant when friends visit or I just want a relaxed meal. I just saw Faridahs' comments.. yes, the restaurants' menu has changed through the years and there are a few favorites I wish they would resurrect, but the quality of their current food is very good, the offerings are varied and the service is impeccable. The only suggestion I would offer them is to hire older people to run the front. The very young women who hostess and deal with reservations are not particularly concerned with customer service or being welcoming."}
{"text":"Houston's is a great environment and great service. Not to tough on the wallet either!! I recommend when in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"If I were stranded on a desert island and had to pick one restaurant to be on the island with me...Hoiustons would be it. This is my favorite place to go. I love the inside, the menu, the service and the food. They have the best burger around."}
{"text":"Waited 45 mins on a Wednesday evening (had no reservations), but boy it was worth it! I had the pork ribs and they were very tender with just enough BBQ sauce. Fries that came with were just as good. They had messed up one of our orders, so they gave us a free desert."}
{"text":"Once my favorite restaurant, a recent dinner drops Houston's off my list. Terrible; baby back ribs were neither baby or lean, shrimp were mealy, and portions of cole slaw and FF were halved. The ribs were large, fat terrible ribs and I complained to management."}
{"text":"Visited  NYE to celebrate my wedding. Food was great ambience was romantic. We had the Ribs and the Hawaiian Ribeye. DELISH!"}
{"text":"The ribs are to die for and the chicken tenders are out of this world. I always start off with the Chicago style spinach dip with chips and its always amazing. The only thing holding this restraint back is the lack of consistency in reference to their ribs. Sometimes they are really crispy and other times they are a little softer and covered in sauce, but besides that this is the place to go for ultimate pig out feast."}
{"text":"Solid place for a nice lunch or dinner.  They make a mean burger for sure.  Salads are good too, and the list of Napa wines is outstanding.  Sometimes the crowds are just overwhelming, though."}
{"text":"Saturday nights are for Houston's. Especially since it is the only day they serve their fabulous chili. The chili goes great with the cheesburger. Which I feel is the best burger in town! The service is always great!"}
{"text":"Houston's and I have been friends for about 15 years and our friendship was very strong for about the first ten. In the last 5 years or so Houston's has really put our friendship to the test. Obviously through the years the prices have increased but in the last few they have really been increasing. Recently they halved the size over the caesar salad and almost doubled the price to 8 dollars. I know to a lot of the customer base this may not be a problem, but it still doesn't make it ok. Another recent issue is the change in potato type for their fries, they're just not as crispy as they used to be. But worst of all is the Houston's/Hillstone split. When Houston's moved from the Esplanade to a bigger space across the street they rebranded with the company's Hillstone name. At first it was all still the same (except they moved the sushi over from Scottsdale) but now corn on the caesar salad? I guess I'll have to stick to Scottsdale.  I understand menu changes happen but it was so good and so the same for so many years why do they have to switch it all up now? Pretty sure the business model was working just fine. I will continue to eat at Houston's, that veggie burger can't be beat, but over the years we have started slipping further apart."}
{"text":"Visited the area for business from California and this place was so delish we not only tipped our waitress $20 we ALSO tipped the cook who made our steaks $20! The Hawaiian ribeye ...YUMMY! Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant! Everything that my husband and I have ordered off of the menu has been great. Love that the Greyhound is made of fresh squeezed grapefruit too."}
{"text":"12-23-10

After flying from San Jose to Phoenix for a business meeting in Scottsdale we were starving.  We were ready to eat almost anything.  On the way to our hotel we spotted Houston's Restaurant.  I remember from previous trips.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere upscale but causal.  It's little dark inside but warm.

About their food:  My husband and I split a grilled chicken sandwich with fries.  He had a glass of white wine and I had a martini which hit the spot.   
No comparison to SUBWAY sandwich !!

Houston's is a little pricey but overall a very pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Note to management:  please bring Houston's back to Chicago, please???
I live in Chicago - but every time I am in AZ I stop in to Houston's at least once (OK, at least twice, and the first time is generally right after my plane lands).  I am a Houston's junkie.  I also used to work here in high school - but that bias has totally worn off.  And you know what?  If you worked somewhere and *still* want to eat there, the place must be doing something right. . .
What is that something?  The smoked salmon appetizer, the spinach dip, the Arnold Palmer's with fresh squeezed lemonade, the Greyhounds with fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, the ribs (*drool*), the key lime pie, the apple cobbler, the fries with a side of mustard honey sauce, all of the salads - should I keep going?
As you can see, I love this place.  It is a classic.  Consistently top-notch service (the servers actually adhere to the customer right-of-way rule, know lots about the food, and accommodate any reasonable request, and the bartenders seem to know every patron by first name and favorite drink).  The prices seem to have crept up a bit - but I just don't mind because the positives outweigh the price.  
I *heart* Houston's.  This location is a bit more low-key than the Esplanade, though in the winter and spring you should expect a wait of 30-60 minutes, as they do not accept reservations.
All in all, delicious food, crisp service, and a comfy setting.  I miss you, Houston's!!!"}
{"text":"I am a longtime Houston's fan.  Food is high-quality, delicious...especially the roasted artichoke!  Wine list is fantastic, so many choices.  I usually go with wine by the glass and Houston's has one of the most extensive.  I hope the rumor I heard a few days ago isn't true though....going with only one varietal by the glass...are they crazy??  I love being able to try different styles of wine.  That will be a huge deterrent for me choosing Houston's in the future if that happens.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that there's no way it could be true. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food! The spinach dip is simply the best appetizer you can get anywhere and everything on the menu is delicious. I think its important to be consistent and this place nailed it. I have been going to this Houston's location for 12 years and i can be found here at least once a month but usually more. The fact is Houston's defined prime rib for me and has been my favorite restaurant at its price point ever since."}
{"text":"After moving in our new ASU student we were so excited to go to Houstons. A place where we are familiar with their fantastic food and service. We Went here expecting the same great service and menu as the other locations but instead experienced a rude and unaccommodating staff.  We were shocked at the treatment of a cocktail. I asked for a non-sugar based martini muddled with cucumbers and even though they had cucumbers in the kitchen they would not use them to make a drink!  . Management came out and one woman felt badly because we were leaving.  She seemed so helpful and brought out the restaurant manager who explained they cannot deviate from anything even if the other locations will accommodate guests. He was very specific  in stating this location will never accommodate the special needs of clientele.  We left shocked and disgusted by his location."}
{"text":"I don't' even know where to start...which is a good thing.  The service has always been great and the food is high quality.  

On my recent visit, our dessert was taking \"long\" -- which we didn't even notice -- without saying anything, the server gave us the dessert and told us it was on the house.  Apologized about the delay and everything.  This is what customer service is about.

If this place was closer to where I lived, I would go there once or twice a week.  As it stands, I go in once a month.  

My personal favorites are the Hawaiian Ribeye, the French Dip and the Artichoke Dip.

One of my favorite restaurants, and I always take people here when they come visit from out of town."}
{"text":"this is not the same restaurant that we always loved.  biggest mistake is walking in without a reservation (for many years there were no reservations). 1 and 1/2 hour wait on a tuesday!  times change and, sadly, so do our favorite spots in this town.   we will go to hillstones in the future."}
{"text":"Amazing ribs, as always. Friendly and attentive staff. Beautiful photographs by Mark Klett while entering. Great date night spot!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner for my mother in laws birthday! Had a very comfy booth in the corner on top. Was extremely nice environment and everyone's food was perfect. I especially loved the French dip. Can't wait to come back! Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Try their artichokes. We are addicted. The restaurant is a little pricey but well worth the money. Food and service is always perfect"}
{"text":"I went into this place and didn't know what to expect.  I thought it would be another ho-hum mid-range restaurant.  Boy, was I surprised.  Service was excellent and classy.  Ordered a hamburger. Hamburgers at sit-down restaurants are  usually dry and hard.  This hamburger was moist, soft and perfectly cooked to my medium order, probably the best hamburger I've had at a sit-down restaurant. Pure-sugar Mexican Coke was another nice and thoughtful touch.  Their choice of music was good and even the bathroom was beautiful!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Houston's for years, typically three to four times per month. In general the food is good, wait staff pleasant and informative and the overall experience pleasant.

Tonight it was different. Our server did not know anything about wine to the point of bring terribly misinformed. She had been well coached though and every wine she \"recommended\" was $15 per glass. I ate the pork filet which was good. I asked her if they had brought the rosé back that they used to carry. She then promptly recommended a riesling since she equated rosé with white zinfandel with sweet. Definitely no knowledge of wine.

The wine list itself has become tired and for the most part features the same old wine they have been serving for years . They try to picture their list as being interesting and eclectic but it is simply a bit bizarre, old and musty.

What really got my goat was that I ordered an aperitif, sweet vermouth, up. When I got the bill they charged me $12 for it. The same price as their martinis with the exception that there was no vodka or gin. The server went to talk to the bar when I complained and she came back to tell me that vermouth is a spirit and therefore the price should be the same as a cocktail. Any idiot knows that vermouth is an aromatised wine and not a spirit. I could buy an entire bottle of vermouth for $12. I never complain about restaurant prices but I guess even I have a limit on being gouged.

They are slowly becoming a formula restaurant and at +$50 per head I demand more.

They treated me like a moron, took me for granted and I can assure you I am not."}
{"text":"Can you say 'french dip'? Can you say 'chili'? Can you say 'burger'? Can you say 'spinach artichoke dip'? Well, if you can and you're interested in these kind of words, go to Houston's for only the BEST ever, hands down, without a doubt, yummiest french dip sandwich you've ever had in your life (be forewarned, they put mayo on the bread, so if you're not into mayo on your french dip, like me, then ask for no mayo),but Ooooooooooooooo... YUM!! And if you like killer chili (they only serve chili on Saturday's), you won't be sorry you ordered theirs -- it's amazing. Or how about a kick-butt burger, eh? Simply delish! And don't even get me started on their artichoke dip -- there isn't enough word space on Yelp for me to go there! Trust. 

This is by far one of my favorite restaurants, unfortunately I live in Portland (where they've never even heard of a Houston's -- poor people!) and I only get to visit the Scottsdale location every once in awhile when I hide myself away in my husband's suitcase whenever he goes there on business. :( 

GREAT french dip! Fabulous fries! Fantabulous chili. Kick-butt burger! S.P.I.N.A.C.H. A.R.T.I.C.H.O.K.E.  D.I.P. Mmmm... in the best possible way!

A few tips: 

No baseball caps for men/boys -- unless you're sitting in the bar area, and then it's fine. But if you're a boy, you can't be in the bar area, so take that hat off!

Dress is casual or you can even dress-it-up a bit if you want and not feel out of place in the least bit. 

Can get really busy, so if you're in a hurry, get there early!"}
{"text":"Nice looking place inside. Terrible service, waited for over 2 hours even with a reservation! Would never come here again! Great food just really upset about the wait!"}
{"text":"Definitely love !!  since this place is my place to go every time,  great service ,great food recommend the trout yummy ,spinach dip yummy prices are  reasonable if you don't drink alcohol but just all-around great food, all the time, burgers and killer French fries ,ck salad ohh and the ribs !!! Yum Yum Yum. Great atmosphere I love how it's dark inside but each table is lit perfectly:) perfect for two people or four  people not for groups though very intimate very cool very chill atmosphere just remember try to make a reservation"}
{"text":"Good food, great service.  Three of us celebrated a birthday yesterday at Houston's and had a great meal. Highly recommend the fish sandwich and the Thai steak noodle salad. The grilled artichoke appetizer was accompanied by a zippy aioli and the Rosemary focacia was toasted and served with olives. Both were delicious!  Too full for dessert, will have to go back!"}
{"text":"I give Houston 's a two star for the mediocre cocktail drinks. One would think the restaurant would have better signiture drinks. Disappointed."}
{"text":"No other complaints except for the \"music\".   Way too much repetitious pounding on the brain.  One phrase...repeat...repeat...24 times.  Change the music!!!"}
{"text":"Service is 5-star.  Very, very professional and attentive staff.  Food is always excellent.  My husband dreams about the fish sandwich, which is not served on Mondays so we never go that day, lol!  The coleslaw is unique and delicious and the salads are exceptionally good.  Burgers are delicious also.

A little pricey, but the food and the service are definitely worth it.  Love"}
{"text":"Houston's has by far the best veggie burger!!! Love the crunchy string fries! The service is always great and the consistency of the food is always spot on. So if you are looking for a great meal that you can count on this is the place to try if you haven't been yet. Beware, if you try and go for dinner during season (nov-april) go early or be prepared to wait one hour+....but worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here 3 of the 5 days that we were in town. I've NEVER in my life eaten jumbo shrimp cocktail like this. It was amazing. I ate it all three times. When Jesus wants jumbo shrimp, this is where he eats it! It's that good. LOL! Be prepared, the red cocktail sauce has a kick. But it's so good that you can't stop eating it. Yummy in my tummy Mommy!"}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere. Price is up to par for a place like this. I like their ribs, prime rib sandwich and spinach artichoke dip."}
{"text":"Hate to rain on the parade given all the positive ratings, but my review is based upon actual experience and not some fluffy \"great place\" reviews.  I arrived there at 4:00 pm and met a business associate for a cocktail ($15 for a glass of cheap wine that other bars serve for $7).  At 5:00 pm the manager comes over and says that we either have to order a meal or leave.  It's all about money, and they need the small table for 2 that we are at.  We left and I will never return again.  We were talking quietly, not bothering anyone.  Our crime was sitting at a table for 2 when the dinner crowd began to arrive.  If that is your definition of a great restaurant, you can have this place.  I'll go elsewhere.  As I am the CEO of a mid-size business, this will hurt them more than they might think, but I've never had this happen before in my lifetime."}
{"text":"We ate here on 8/5/2014 and 8/6/2014.

I'm giving this place 5 stars because my wife can't say enough about it and we have friends who eat here EVERY DAY when they vacation in Scottsdale.  They rave over the sundaes and the veggie burgers.  If it was just me, I'd give it 4 stars.

On our first visit, my wife got the veggie burger (which is made on site) and she said it was the best she's ever had.

I am a burger and fries guy and I found the hickory burger to be flavorful and cooked properly.  They don't give you many fries but this seems to be the norm for upscale restaurants.

What makes this place for me is the ambiance and the excellent, attentive, friendly wait staff.  ALL the waiters are very friendly, not just YOURS who is looking for a good tip.  You can tell the difference when friendliness is part of their training.

We did share a hot fudge sundae.  You should get a hot fudge sundae.  Here's the thing about those.  You get a generous helping of ice cream, whipped cream, and then your own pitcher of what I can only assume is their own chocolate sauce.  I have had better tasting sauces, but no one has ever let me decide how much sauce I want on it, so the pitcher on the side was pretty cool.  I happen to like a lot of sauce so I added more sauce every couple of bites.

Note... we returned late the next night for another round of Sundaes.  We each got our own.  This is when I found out they had whipped cream.  My wife, apparently, ate the whipped cream on our first one without me noticing."}
{"text":"Had a delicious Allen brothers ny prime rib.  The food was delicious!!  The restaurant service was wonderful also.  Had a great meal"}
{"text":"We ate at Houston's with another couple.  Overall, a great experience.  

We started with cocktails, and my Mojito was a home run.  It was fresh, minty and delicious.  

My husband and I shared a rack of ribs, cole slaw and a baked potato.  All was delicious, especially the ribs.  The portions were so large, we were able to take some of the ribs home with us.

My after-dinner cappuccino was just o.k.  That, and the fact that the noise level was very high, kept me from giving Houston's a five-star rating.  

We will return."}
{"text":"This place always has excellent service and food! Don't miss the smoked salmon appetizer with toast points. It's a generous portion and so delish! It's the only Houston's location the serve it! I'm from California and none of the restaurants here serve it. Bummer! It's always my go to! The veggie platter entree is alway amazing too. Don't be afraid to come here with your steak loving friends of you're a vegetarian!"}
{"text":"Houston's is a fantastic restaurant. The food is great for the price and the customer service is fantastic. We have eaten here since they opened and rarely have I left disappointed. Their prime rib is probably the best I've had when you consider it is very consistent. I may have had better elsewhere only to return and it was terrible. Not the case with Houston's. Try the grilled artichoke for an appetizer, not too healthy, but boy is it good!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from the midwest and this was our first experience at Houstons.  And what an experience it was.  The food was really fantastic. ..I got the chicken fingers tender and awesome...my husband got the strip steak. Very well flavored and tender.  Cooked perfect.  But the most intriguing and spectacular thing was the wait staff.  They believe in a team based service.  Everyone was helping clear dishes, refill drinks, etc.  They all walked tall and sophisticated.   It was clearly the best experience we have had.  The final touch was the hot fudge sundae.  Not a normal canned fudge.  They make it homemade with Belgium chocolate.  Most delicious.  I would highly recommend Houstons and the hot fudge sundae."}
{"text":"Place is outstanding. Went on super bowl Sunday and sat at the bar for a relaxing dinner. Ordered the Prime Rib with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Phenomenal dish. The Hawaiian rib eye is quite good as well. A little expensive but well worth it. Spent just over 100$ With gratuity which Included dinner, a few cocktails, and dessert. Really good place to bring a date. Nice atmosphere and great service. Top notch!"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight with friends. The meal was excellent exceeding our expectations. We had the best service by our server Toby she went out of her way to make sure our dinner was truly great. Thanks again we will be back"}
{"text":"Houstons is probably my favorite restaurant.  I have been going there since I was a little kid in Maryland and havent stopped.  I have seen the menu change (no more cheese bread...unless you ask), I have seen the prices go up, and now I have seen the addition of sushi.  Who would have thought...Houston's and sushi.  Kind of a weird combo.  But I will tell you it works.  I have tried two of the rolls and both were fantastic.  Mango Tuna and Spicy Tuna.  Definitly give it a shot as an appetizer or for your next meal.  Very filling as the rolls are fairly large.  

Service is always great (Rainy is my favorite bartender in town).  Atmosphere is very nice, people very friendly as I usually sit at the bar.  Houston's is a no brainer when you cant decide where to eat.  Never a bad meal."}
{"text":"I honestly believe you cannot make a mistake ordering anything on the menu. The descriptions are simple because the food is absolutely indescribable. Five of us all had different meals and everything was incredible. Prices were not outrageous, service was very very good and the entire experience was fabulous. My only warning is get there early or be ready to wait; either way it's completely worth it!"}
{"text":"Houston's is good but definitely not the caliber that they used to be.  The service was sub-par, the food was good this time but has been hit and miss the past couple of times.  They are missing the consistency that you used to be able to rely on.  Also, when we ordered a birthday brownie, they didn't bring a candle and they billed us for it - SERIOUSLY?! (the waitress knew as she said \"oops, I forgot the candle\")  Between that and charging $3 PER soda, it just seems like they are nickle and diming their customers to death.  J Alexanders has the same food with the same hit and miss service so, why pay more at Houston's.  

The food we had this time was their spinach/artichoke dip with chips and we each got their chicken salad which seemed to have more peanuty spice to it which we enjoyed.  Their brownie dessert is to die for....probably literally with all that sugar but oh so good.  The total for the food and 2 sodas and tip was $70 (no alcohol!).  You can go to a lot better places for $70 or spend half as much for the same food across the street at J Alexanders.  Houston's no longer offers anything that distinguishes themselves or makes them worth it."}
{"text":"Houston's has great food and is very consistent. You always know what your getting. I love their chicken salad and atlantic salmon with brown beans and rice. There's a wide variety of menu choices so everyone in your group can be accommodated."}
{"text":"It is a nice place.  However, their selection is weak and their prices are WAY too high.  If you want to go to a place for a business lunch it is OK........ but you would go broke if you kept using it regularly."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant in Scottsdale that I have been to so far.  I had the Hawain Rib-Eye and they did a good job of cooking to my exact specifications,  no too mention that the seasoning they used made the steak all that much more tastier.  Their coleslaw stands out more than your average coleslaw because it doesn't rely on a strong bitter taste that most coleslaws have because of the vinegar.  The glass of merlot I had with the meal was not too strong, not too weak, and had just the right amount of fruitiness to make it a perfect compliment to my steak dinner.  What was also a delight was the desert,  the hot fudge sunday is great since they serve the hot fudge on the side so you can distribute it in whatever amount you desire at anytime that you are eating the ice cream.  The atmoshere isn't too flashy, the service is punctual and friendly,  and to top it all off, they do the right thing of having the kitchen be right in plain view for everyone to see.  Not every restaurant does that but every restaurant should."}
{"text":"Great experience. Service was on point. Professional and Courteous. Our French Dip was undercooked but they corrected it."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for 7pm.  Not seated until 7:25pm.  The hostesses had no idea what they were doing.  It seemed that many others around us were a half hour or more late being seated for their reservations as well. Once we were seated, the waitress was very average.  Food was OK, but will not return because the service was awful.  There are way too many other good restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Been a patron for years and we went for our annual cheeseburgers which have always been one of the best in Scottsdale until now. Apparently, the new owner decided to redo it and very disappointed. Lettuce and tomato ice cold, strong hickory barbecue sauce added and then they cut it into 4 pieces and served like a club sandwich. I have no idea why. Burger was cold and growing colder.  Impossible to eat and falling apart in addition to the chewy bun. They did remake them and comped our food which was greatly appreciated and the service and attention were excellent. Cole slaw was outstanding as well. The burgers were cooked to perfection but know to request uncut, etc."}
{"text":"I usually love this place but today must have been an off day.  Food was good as usual but the service was meh..."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't think you could ever go wrong with Houstons. Pricy, yes, but always worth it! Favorite lunch: Saturday's firehouse chili and the French dip sandwich."}
{"text":"I lived in Phoenix for years, but never ate at Houston's until my friend Amie came from Wisconsin. We had breakfast there, and the food was great. We ate at the bar and the service was good. Mimosa was potent as I was tipsy after only the first drink. The price is a little high, but that's what you pay for the high end type of place it comes across as."}
{"text":"One of my fav's for service, quality, attention to detail and Perfection!

I have never had a bad experience...sometimes the wait is longer in the winter,
but after all, Houston's is  well known in our Scottsdale and foodie's do frequent these better establishments.  For dinner, just go in earlier, like before 5pm and most always get sitted.

Usually I order the famous caesar salad and salmon dinner.  One can not miss out on their spinach dip...the best bar none."}
{"text":"This place is amazing I could come here everyday! It is a great go to spot in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We hit this place up every time we have company in town or if we need a reliable place for a fantastic meal. Can't go wrong with the ribs or the salmon. Saturday nights they have homemade chili and if you have a chance, order it. Great service, great atmosphere, and worth every cent."}
{"text":"The best service in the industry! Always great food and not overpriced when considering the quality of food. 
Kind of weird that they don't offer bottled water or take reservations.
Besides that, great restaurant!"}
{"text":"The very best steak house I've ever had (I've had dozens).
When I am in Scottsdale, and want to really splurge, and don't want the tourist trap or the glamor of famous chefs. This is the best place.
The Rib Eye just melts in your mouth, so tender!

Service is excellent even though it packs them in with business crowd."}
{"text":"The French Dip was the best I ever had... The Prime Rib the previous night, one of the worst Iv'e had.. I'm going back again today just for the french dip!! AMAZING"}
{"text":"Started going to original Houston's at the Esplanade. Followed them when they moved across the street and changed the name to Hillstone. Now we are back to the Houston's scottsdale location. Beautiful interior, excellent service and delicious food combine to make an unbeatable restaurant. The shrimp cocktail is spectacular."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday mid afternoon as part of a party of 4. Had a salad and their soup of the day, chili. Spent all night throwing up with severe stomach cramps, diarrhea and other signs of food poisoning. As a retired restaurant executive I recognize food poisoning and I definitely had it."}
{"text":"I have never been to Houston's, but by husband has been twice, in other states.

What a pleasant surprise!! 
Wonderful elevated contemporary desert environment.
The staff demonstrated service \"discipline\" and teamwork, with welcoming and friendly
attitudes.

We started with the Chicago-Style Spinach Dip-yummy!!
I had their signature Cheeseburger with steamed broccoli, and my husband their featured Texas burger and fries.
Everything was fresh and flavorful, including the homemade buns.

We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great food, long wait times.  This place is very romantic. When you walk in there is a nice gas fireplace and a beautiful bar.  When you can find a seat it is a great place to go :)"}
{"text":"I love Houston's especially the Steak Thai salad and the French Dip - the best any where.  I hope the rumor of the change to the bar about one selection of wine and liquor is only a rumor.  I love having the option to buy a variety of wine by the glass in different price points and types.  Houston' s please don't change we love you just the way you are great with many options!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. They did not honor our reservation & the hostess was incredibly condescending. I will not go back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and nearly always get the same thing:  cheeseburger (cheddar), no bun, and will split salad with someone.

I have never had any issues with the meat being done not to my requests which vary from \"stab it and slab it\" to medium rare.  

Arizona, believe it or not, is not known for good beef (or so my parents keep telling me but they have lived here for 20 years to my measly 4 so I suppose they would know, eh?).

OH--their Arnold Palmers are amazing!  

Consistently good food, good service and I have yet to be surprised in a negative manner, which is excellent!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to Houston's for about 5 years, as time goes bye Houston's service/ food has really taken a back seat to the quality food/service we were used to. The last two times for dinner my wife and I love the prime rib French dip we were told both times they were sold out of the prime rib, so we opted for the Hawaiian steak(yuk) ask for medium rare it was over cooked n the taste was awful, as we were choking down the Hawaiian steak we watched waiter after waiter serving the same prime rib French dip to customers after we have almost finished are dinner, The service the last two times there has been just terrible, I know I won't be back, to all u Houston lovers enjoy, but don't settle for less like I did, Houston's has gone down hill, peace, John"}
{"text":"I don't know where to start...service was excellent, the food was incredible, even the purified water was really good (sure beats Phoenix water) and I love the whole 'only booths' in the restaurant idea.  We had the smoked salmon to start, which was probably the best smoked salmon I've ever eaten (yep, that's a big claim there).  I then had the Thai noodle salad and my boyfriend had a burger, which both were really delicious.  I highly enjoy restaurants that use good ingredients and keep it simple, which that is what Houston's does.  I don't think the food is particularly fancy, but it is good and you know you're eating a good product."}
{"text":"My wife and I had been going to the several Houston's in Atlanta since around 1978.  We were very happy to know our favorite restaurant was also here in Scottsdale when we moved here some years ago.  All in all, we have eaten more times at Houston's in the past 38 years than all the other comparably priced restaurants we have eaten at combined. The food, atmosphere and service are consistently that good.  

Now that we are up in years, we don't typically eat as much food as we used to, and frequently will split a meal such as the ribs.  Not shown on the menu is that for $6.00 more, they'll add six more ounces of ribs above the standard rack, which is a perfect amount for the two of us along with the sides and wine.  If you like espresso, they make the best I've had anywhere.  It is essentially a double and very aromatic and rich--better then even my home-brewed version using my Illy machine.

The staff are always friendly, engaging if you invite it, and efficient.  I've joked that the manager and his staff could operate a Nuclear Submarine if called upon--everyone knows their job and does it well.  Many of the staff have been there since we've been going there and know our names and treat us like friends of the family.  Such great service with the great food adds to a great dining experience.

Try this restaurant and you very likely will have a new favorite."}
{"text":"Seriously - is there a restaurant with more professional service and consistently high quality food? I know they are a chain, but this restaurant is one of the most well-oiled, professionally staffed places in the Valley. Food great, service phenomenal, ambience always nice. Hats off."}
{"text":"On average, I eat at ten restaurants a week.  In my life, I have never experienced such utter disdain for the wishes of the customer as I witnessed last night.  My overall experience in your restaurant was one star.  It would have been zero stars except for the collective, attentive service we were given by an obviously well trained wait staff.  It's too bad that you can't train away indifference towards the customer.  My problem is with a Houston's philosophy of: it doesn't matter what the customer wants, you are going to have it our way, or no way.
Here is what happened.  The fish sandwich is fried.  One of us wanted it grilled.  The answer was \"we can't do that\".  Why not?  You have a grill.  One of us wanted the chicken salad with the dressing on the side.  The answer was \"we can't do that\".  Why not?  Is the salad pre-prepared with dressing on it?  One of us wanted that salad with salmon instead of chicken.  The answer was \"we can't do that\".  Why not?  This doesn't even deserve any further discussion.
The fact that we will never set foot in your restaurant again will have absolutely no impact on you at all.  It's obvious how little you care about our wishes.  What I hope has an impact, however, is that every single day I will relay my story of the lack of any customer service I received from you.  You see, I'm in the customer relationship business and my goal is to differentiate myself from you in every way.  I will tell this story to every client, prospective client, associate, and friend, as a lesson on how not to do business.  The positive is that the manner in which I treat my customers has been reinforced by your lack of basic business practices.  
That's good for me, bad for you."}
{"text":"Can't beat Houston's for service and FOOD. My mouth is watering thinking about the spinach dip and smoked salmon apps. The grilled salmon is like butter melting in your mouth. I have never had better spaghetti squash, brussel sprouts or braised cabbage with goat cheese. Their salads are also fantastic. I dare you to find a better creamy blue cheese dressing. 
Mmmmm, I want some right now."}
{"text":"Houston's may be pricey, but it doesn't disappoint! 

My favorite entree is the filet salad. It is AMAZINg, but everything on the menu is excellent and they have wonderful wine to pair with any meal. 

I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a consistent and nice dinner in the area."}
{"text":"The Hawaiian Rib-eye is amazing!!! The servers are so friendly. Very upscale environment and loved the hot fudge sundae!"}
{"text":"Had very positive experience with Houston's in the past. This wasn't good. They seemed to not have much that was on the menu (e.g. Out of grilled Artichokes, and only had two desserts; hot fudge sundae and berries with mascarpone.  Service was decent but felt that $100+ for a salad, a rotisserie chicken and a couple of drinks seemed like a lot. And nothing like other Houston's I've been to before. Much more like a TGI Fridays. 

Was told the sushi menu was discontinued since Hillstone opened across town. 

As I've said previous experience has always been pretty great for Houston's. Just don't come to this one."}
{"text":"Great food, Great costumer service. I do not like to go through pages in the menu so Houstons offers just the perfect size menu, that must be one of the reasons why the food is so delicious. I have eaten most of the items in the menu my favorites is the Thai salad and my second is the Cheeseburger. The price is very fair for the quality food that they serve."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today for the first time in a long time. I used to eat at their old location in the esplanade but it closed (Hillstone reopened across the street). I got the thai sirloin salad though I normally get the cheeseburger as it's made from freshly ground beef daily - I digress. The beef was cooked medium rare, as requested and the noodles and salad were exquisite. The price point ($20) is a little high for a salad but it's pretty amazing."}
{"text":"I would give 5 stars if the took reservations....
We love Houston's. Everything on the menu seems to be awesome. Spinach dip, smoked salmon, artichokes when in season are great appetizers. For lunch my favorite is the french dip, the bread is amazing on that sandwich. The burger isn't bad either. My wife likes the grilled chicken salad but gets peanut sauce on side. For dinner I usually get the ribs and eat them with a fork they are so tender. Their rotisserie chicken is awesome as well. We are so close but without reservations its not uncommon to wait an hour or more so we get take out quite a bit. Servers are great and they have great high chairs, they clip onto the table so kids can sit inside the booth out of harms way."}
{"text":"Wow what a great place. There steaks are amazing. The prime rib is just the best.  The services great.  We had reservations and was seated on time. Will return. Great place"}
{"text":"Been here twice for weekend lunch and was not at all disappointed.  Both times service was awesome, food was delicious and the place ran like a well oiled machine."}
{"text":"Just a ghost of what it was in the past.
We have eaten at Houston's for years and loved  it in the past .  They have made changes from what kept us coming back....from the quality of fries to filet----not the same.  Won't return."}
{"text":"This was our first time to this restaurant, and it will not be the last.  There was 3 of us in our party and the food and service was excellent.  We started with the Rosemary Focaccia.  Which was superb.  For our main course we had the Roasted Prime Rib, USDA Prime Center Cut Filet and the Rotisserie Chicken.  We all enjoyed our meals immensely.  I also ordered their coleslaw, which was also outstanding.  I think they included Kale in it, but the taste was simply amazing.  A big thank you to Kristyna H. our server.  She was amazing and made great recommendations and was a pleasure to talk with all night.  While it is pricey, you tend not to mind when the food is this good.  We also shared a brownie, which was insanely good.  Massive recommendation to this place."}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner there on Easter.  The food and the service were both excellent.  Well worth the drive over from the West Valley."}
{"text":"My out of town parent really wanted to come here after eating here 9 years ago. I have eaten at the Los Gatos and SF locations previously, so I had high expectations. I feel a bit sad I missed the grilled artichoke, but I respect using only the best seasonal ingredients. I was very impressed that the waitress was well-informed on the vegan options. My vegan modified veggie burger was excellent. My mother loved her French dip sandwich. Overall the restaurant is a bit noisy, but the food makes it worth the inconvenience."}
{"text":"Houston s used to be the best restaurant in town. But their portion size has gotten so small and quality is just not it used to be to justify raising their prices. I ordered a hickory burger with fries and barely had enough fries for a child. My wife ordered a salad that again looked like it was on the child's menu."}
{"text":"Houston's used to be one of my favorite restaurants.  It seems as though they have not updated the menu since the 90's.  They still have the same old delicious tortilla soup and such.  But not a very inspired menu.  The service is still great I went back and forth one 3 or 4 stars.  As I wrote the review it seems as though they a 4 stars when they used to five."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a late night drink right before they closed on a Tuesday night. It was a fair price for the High West Whiskey, but what really made my night was how Tabby and Kat made me feel welcome even though they were closing. They had plenty of time to spend with me and ask about my night. I'm a bar manager at a nice place right down the street, so I can really appreciate their late night service and the time they speny with me. Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. I have been going to this location since they opened. I enjoy the community table in the bar area.  I don't have to wait for a table.  They truly have great wine always.  I order different stuff sometimes and shocked of the wine selection.  Many restaurants it's tough to find really great wines by the glass.  Houston's always does this and food great."}
{"text":"We've lived in the valley for 35 years and have eaten at all the best restaurants in town.  We travel, we spend $$$$ on dining out.   This Houston's is slipping continuously down the slope of poor service and bad attitude (not to mention smaller portion sizes).  It's too bad; We're going to stop coming.  Slow to bus tables.  Slow on the water refills.  Have to remind on the condiments.  Everything is wrong here now.  Gotta be the leadership."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go if you don't know where to go in the area.

Seasonal dish: Artichokes. Pretty good.

The noodle steak salad was also tasty.

Kind of pricey for what you get but still a solid option.

Long wait although decent service.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Oldie but goodie.  Lived in Houston from 90 to 95 where the Westheimer location was a regular stop spot.   Never expected to run across the restaurant on a weekend trip to Phoenix.  Pleasant surprise.

We had reservations so I was disappointed to have to wait 15 minutes at arrival.  Server was friendly but service was not as special as I remembered.  Salt shaker was clogged and by the time someone brought a new one, food was just lukewarm.  

We ordered the Hawaiian Ribeye and Ribs subbing baked potato for fries.  Ribeye on point and cooked perfectly.  Potato just like I remember in flavor, but glad now 1/2 the size.  Always thought the mammoth size of old was wasteful and overkill.  Problem solved.  Ribs were God too.

Other than slower service than we  like, good experience.  Definitely good flash back."}
{"text":"Used to love this place when I lived here, and had the opportunity to come back on a work trip.  Was packed (even VERY late at night), being Superbowl weekend, but they made space for me at the bar anyways.  I got the Thai Steak salad (I think?) and a bunch of beer.  Great service, probably even more so due to my seating.  I was near the entrance though so every time the door opened I was attacked with a burst of cold air.

Best part is I somehow expensed the beer with my company (and didn't get questioned) :)"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! We went for my birthday dinner a few weeks ago and every dish and appetizer was delicious. My boyfriend had the ribs and swears they are the best ever, my salmon was the same way! This place is definitely a must, not too expensive but still nice and romantic as well."}
{"text":"Unbelievable poor customer service simply trying to reserve a table for birthday dinner.  The problem? Asking for a table for 5. We were told there are limited tables that accommodate 5 and are first come first serve only.  Literally was told that when we get there \"we might be able to accommodate you.\"  Really!? We are going to come for a birthday dinner and hope we might get seated. 

Segway to Hillstone. Same company but entirely different service.  Polite,  accommodating,  glad to help. 

So,  avoid this Houston's location.  Enjoy Hillstone instead."}
{"text":"I thought I had died and landed in restaurant heaven. I ordered the Hawaiian steak from their fall menu and to say it was divine would be an understatement. The loaded baked potato was just as delicious. The service is topnotch. A bit loud during the busy time but the food and service more than made up for that."}
{"text":"Three stars because I'm kind of mixed about this place.

Definitely the stars for the atmosphere it's a beautiful cozy restaurant. 

Not to sure what's going on with the prices and what they give you.  My husband ordered the chicken dish and literally just got one little tiny piece of chicken for dinner.  Portion size is very small for the price they ask.

The hamburger was OK but again you have to pay extra for sides five dollars for coleslaw money extra for french fries etc. etc.

Glad I checked it out but I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is one my favorite lunch or dinner stops in Phoenix. The menu is loaded with great food. I can never resist the artichoke spinach dip!!

My new favorite dish is the grilled chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night. Made reservations for 9. Got there at 8:45. Got seated at 9:15 with no acknowledgment of our wait. The wait staff seemed frazzled. They allowed us to order and then told us all of the dishes they were out of. Two of the five things they were out of were my wife's top two choices.  Would've been nice to know when they gave us the menus. 

I went with a steak, which was fine, but awkward as she had to settle for chicken tenders. The grilled artichoke was on point, though. I ordered a beer. It never showed up. My wife asked for a cocktail menu. They said they didn't have one but they could make whatever. 

Our waitress seemed disinterested and barely checked on us. The food server said nothing to us and gave us an icy stare. We spent $75 to have a celebration meal that we very much regretted. Next time I'll remember to spend the extra dough on Ruth's Chris or save $10 and go to Charleston's. I've never had a bad experience at either one. 

Don't get me wrong, the food that they did have in stock was decent, but it wasn't worth the price once you factor in the apathetic service and the LOUD atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious, simple food every single visit. Consistency is key, and Houston's has got it. I love that they don't put anything on the menu that they can't execute near perfectly any night of the week.

The spinach dip, salmon, tuna, loup de mer, and seasonal vegetables are always beautiful and fresh. The Hawaiian rib-eye is also fantastic if you're in the mood for meat and potatoes. I only wish they took reservations!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. What kind of establishment doesn't have high chairs or booster seats and the only excuse they have is that they couldn't keep them clean. This is a Houston/hillstone policy. Their recommendation, bring your own. This will be the last time coming here"}
{"text":"Read a lot of reviews on the rib eye;  didn't share the same experience.  I ordered a medium-well steak, and before even tasting it, I noticed that no juice oozing while I cut through it.  I've had medium-well steaks before, and this is hands-down the driest.  Most reviews here describe a rare/medium-rare steak, so maybe it would have been much better if I ordered it medium-rare;  but that's not how I like my steak.  The manager mentioned that anything above medium and the vinegar-based marinade makes the steak drier than a normal medium-well.  Waitress should have probably mentioned that.  Returned the steak and got a prime rib; was average.  Manager was great about the exchange.

My wife had a sea bass fish - was pretty good.  Desert was pretty good too (brownie with custard and ice cream).  Service was great.  

I would not go back  - somewhere like Keg is much better IMHO and more cuts/selections for similar level of service and comparable price-range."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here ........ good attentive service...... well prepared tasty food .... ample portions ...... fair prices......... like Houston's a lot ......."}
{"text":"Just a great place for lunch or dinner actually! This one is particularly well managed and is a great venue. I love the entire menu but the French onion soup is rediculous! Had the chicken Cobb salad it was great as well."}
{"text":"One of the best filets I have ever eaten! Simply mouthwatering! For dessert, I had the apple cobbler. Very sweet, but very good."}
{"text":"First time in tonight and I gotta say I'm not very impressed. Small menu. Just ok service. I felt really rushed because our server kept Trying to take away plates while we were still eating.....2 of the people i was with were drinking iced tea faster than our server could refill apparently because they were constantly empty. Then when they did get filled, they were without for another 10 min while the server took their glasses to refill. At one point my hubby had to ask for his tea that never got returned. The food was alright. Hubby found a bone in his French dip...when we asked a woman of that is normal she said no then kind of dismissed the issue....probably won't bother going back. Too many other choices with better service"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Houston's already?! One of my all time favorites anywhere. I can honestly say that I could eat here 7 days a week....and come in just as excited as the first time every time I step foot in the door. I have dreams about the French dip it's so amazing, and the Ribs are a close second.

I have been to this location at least 30 times, and Houston's and Hillstone's all over the USA. The service and food are always consistent and top notch.

I've never had a bad meal here, so you really can't go wrong. I could go on and on, but here are some all time favorites:

Spinach and artichoke dip
BEST French Dip EVER - prime rib shaved to perfection with a jus 
Cheeseburger - grass fed, ground in house, get it medium rare. One of the best in town.
Chicken sandwich - Chik Fil A style but way more incredible
Fish sandwich - the quality of the fish will catch you by surprise. It's sneaky good!
RIBS - you won't find better ribs anywhere. They put Don & Charlie's to shame. 

The Kale Salad is great as are the fries, baked potato and seasonal vegetable. 

Ok, I'm ready to go to Houston's now!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: Please, please reverse the changes to your burger seasoning and french fries. The shoe string fries were your signature potato, the new fries just aren't as satisfying, (neither is the new portion). The cheeseburger is really over-salted now. Please and thank you!! P.S. I DO love what you've done with the Caesar salad; not all changes are bad!

I love Houston's. Real love too, not puppy love. We've know each other for years and still nothing is more irresistible than the crunch of their fresh Caesar salad with homemade croutons and dressing over Chet Baker's voice and some soft, mood lighting. This is more than a restaurant, it's an experience. I am always happy when I'm at Houston's; partially because I like to pretend I'm rich like 80% of their diners when I'm there. Every once in a while I get a delicious martini with olives stuffed generously with goat cheese. Also their cheese burger is hands down the best burger anywhere.  ANYWHERE."}
{"text":"Came in from SC on vacation and tried it out because it was the closest place to the hotel. I typically don't like dimly lit restaurants, but for this restaurant it seemed to work.
I thought the service was very welcoming, pleasant, and attentive. I had the French dip and it was very good: it was cooked right and it was quality beef. My friends had prime rib and they thought it was very tasty. The au jus was a bit salty, but the horseradish sauce was very tasty. All in all a solid restaurant."}
{"text":"wow this had to be the best prime rib that I have ever and even the hours radish was really good but to bad the server sucked but I'll will be coming back for that primerib my wife had the Salmon witch she said it was good over all"}
{"text":"This is my go to place to sit, have a dinner salad, and watch sports on flat screen.  Service is very friendly, sometimes a little robot like.  Seared ahi tuna salad is my salad of choice at Houston's.  Yum... I will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to Houstons as often as possible and especially for special occasions. We have never ever had a bad experience and all the food is excellent. They are very friendly and accommodating and the staff is extremely professional and are able to answer all questions concerning their food. The thai steak salad is amazing. So is the dessert sundae. So is the steak. And the burgers are AMAZING! Even their baked potato is phenomenal. Safe to say if you want good food, go here!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor, and do NOT order the cous cous. We ordered it upon recommendation from our waitress and we didn't like it one bit. It was way lemoney. I'm not sure what cous cous is really supposed to taste like but it didn't appease me. She found out we didn't like it and ended up taking it off our bill. I guess it pays to be honest in a semi-high end restaurant.

I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants but I really wanted to try Houstons. The prime rib we ordered was alright, and I had the Hawaiian Rib Eye which was TO DIE FOR! The marinade on it was perfect but the only thing was that it somewhat charred the meat since I'm guessing there was sugar in the marainade and that burns quickly. Our dishes came with a HUGE baked potato that I couldn't even finish.

Overall, I would revisit Houstons again for their Hawaiian Rib Eye and perhaps some sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Years ago the Thai Noodle salad could be ordered with tuna or steak. That is when the \"craving\" started. Then, they changed the menu but you could still request the tuna. Today, they said there would be an up charge... Salad ended up costing $32...  Really? They also suggested the three year old at our table order a $10 meal, because they do not have a children's menu.  So, I guess today Houston's pretentiousness killed my craving for a long time."}
{"text":"We decided to go to Houston's for our last dinner here in Phoenix. Our waitress Bree made our night exceptionally good with prompt service and a wonderful explanation of the menu. Everything from the wonderful shrimp cocktail to the unreal Hawaiian steak and French dip everything was extraordinary! One thing for sure is we will be back again could be the best restaurant in Phoenix thanks again Houston's!!! Jon"}
{"text":"I have been going to Houstons for years for dinner, birthdays, anniversaries, date nights etc..  I went there for lunch yesterday and we sat down, ordered our drinks.  The drinks arrived and the server took our order for lunch.  We started to settle in and after a few minutes of taking our order a different server comes over and says, \"We request that gentlemen remove their hats in the dining room.\"  I replied with No thank you but thank you for asking, as i wasnt interested in having my hair a mess from wearing a hat while sitting in a nice restaurant.  She was a bit surprised but polite and asked me again.  I said you are requesting and i am saying, no thank you.  Granted at this point we are waiting for our lunch to come out at this point as well.  The manager then comes over and \"requests\" again. I said, no thank you again and he said, \" Well we cant serve you then.\"  I explained that i had been a customer here for 15 years approx, and had spent holidays, and celebrations and even my wife and i had our first date here.   Jason, the manager, was not interested and said if we wanted to wait for a seat at the bar we could do that instead. This is literally 5 minutes away from our lunch being plated. I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS GOT TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE LITERALLY, ANY MINUTE, HAVING LUCH SERVED AND WE ARE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION.  This should have been discussed as soon as a customer walks in the door. PERIOD.   DISGRACEFUL TREATMENT OF ANY CUSTOMER, MUCH LESS ONE THAT HAS BEEN EATING HERE FOR 15 YEARS!!!  Jason needs to go back to customer service training."}
{"text":"So me and my boyfriend come here for our usual wednesday night dinner. Today was a special one, it was our anniversary. Us being teenagers and not always best dressed walk in and are immediately greeted by stares. We were told that it would be a 30 minute wait. We ended up waiting for about 55 minutes, i understand that sometimes the wait takes a little bit longer but in this case we had many many new people come in without reservations and be seated before us. I felt extremely judged and discriminated against and most like won't be coming back to this location for a while. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Made reservation at 6:15 got seated when arrived,food and service was good . Best part of the night waitress brought me a fresh cold glass"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a long time. Here is the deal. Food is always on point 5 stars. I recommend the filet, key lime pie, pork chop. Cesar salad \"secret menu\". Service we have never had a bad experience 5 stars. Drinks are made correctly 5 stars. The only 2 issues are as follows.

1. Pricing has gone up over the past 2 years. Used to be we could come here on a more regular basis and now it is more of a special occasion type visit. Not sure why the price hike but whatever it has not reduced traffic so it will most likely not change.

2. The wait sucks. If you walk in during prime hours expect 30+ min wait easy. We make reservations and usually wait 10-15 min past our reservation time. They have a great patio but do not use it? They have a large piano area and I have never seen anyone play that damn thing. You can add 4-5 tables if you get rid of that thing.

Highly recommended if you are ok with a wait and paying a little more than normal for a really good meal."}
{"text":"For a 75 minute wait, the only thing Houstons had going for it was the delicious water and tasty salmon. 
Things that need to be improved:
Waters were constantly empty
Our table had empty plates from appetizers for 15+ minutes. Our dinner came before our appetizer was even cleared
Half of our meals were forgotten and I had to remind our waiter
The portions are slowly and slowly decreasing while the prices remain very high. 

The food is always delicious, that is one thing they get right. But if you want a rack of ribs, all you get is a half rack with reject ribs underneath.

I won't be returning."}
{"text":"My favorite go to \"nice\" evening out with my hubby and with friends. Also a great first date place, intimate enough to talk, yet loud enough that silence is not awkward. Also great for client lunch/dinner.
Food and service is outstanding! Order the flying chicken platter that's NOT on the menu anymore, it's to die for! The grilled pork chop is juicy and perfectly charred. ...getting hungry just thinking about it!  I have never had a bad meal.... Other then my burned ribs, which they immediately replaced with perfect ones and took of my tab!!! Polite servers tend to you and the filtered water is refilled to your glass non stop. Great wine list too!"}
{"text":"My first review :) A friend took my sister and I here for our birthday. Staff was really nice and our server was great. We asked her for some recommendations. I ordered the Hawaiian ribeye and omg!!!! It was definitely the best steak I have had so far! It was mouthwatering and the flavor is laced throughout the whole meat. It was a good sized piece, 12 oz probably, and it was so good that I finished it all. I can't wait to go back and have more soon! The spinach dip is yummy too! Wasn't a fan of the five but brownie though, that is why I am giving this place a 4.5 instead of a 5. Not sure how to give half stars. Either way... I'm coming back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Great food. Excellent staff and managment. Just one of those places you can't find anything bad on the menu. Ribs are amazing. Its pricy we usually go on special occasions but its a classy place so I expect to pay a little more but you get your money's worth I can promise you."}
{"text":"Service is usually excellent,  food is consistent and tasty.  Most of the time it is a great dinning experience and the staff can either make or break the meal depending on their attitude.  The ice cream Sunday  or the keylime pie (when in season) is amazing."}
{"text":"Oh gosh I can't get enough of this place,
This place is be oming a second home for me ,I've been coming here for years, and now that I am (old) older ian appreciate this place all the more 
I love coming to this calm, relaxing establishment music not load just in the background.
The food is wonderful the service fantastic,
I love coming here as I can hide out and unwind from a long day 
Best of all no one bothers you if you want to be left alone,
The ambience is old school charm dress up with put being stuffy, you can carry a convo with out shouting or screaming, and enjoy some wonderful food perfect for a dsate night or even a solo relaxing dinner,
 The food:so fresh and tasty made to order not made ahead yay!
Today I changed it up, from my usual 
Flying chicken with a side of fries and a club soda
Haven't tried it yet but it sounds amazing!! 
My usual go to is the artichoke (availability is limited due to season) *they won't serve it if the crop is bad so call ahead!*
Smoked salmon, and fries with a Sazarac drink.
I'm looking forward to a change can't wait to tuck in..
Oooh first taste of the flying chicken absolutely amazing so light and flavorful, nice moist and crispy, with a light tempura batter served with coleslaw, 
Yummy a perfect change from my go to usual 
I'll definitely order it again"}
{"text":"As always, you can't go wrong the Houston's or Hillstone. I highly recommend the spinach artichoke dip. I also recommend the prime rib dip. The Brussels sprouts and excellent and the remoulade they come has no comparison. Service is always excellent and their set table design prevents large noisy parties disrupting dinner. This is why I never hesitate to choose Houston's or say yes to an invite. If you haven't eaten here, go. If you have. Keep going!"}
{"text":"Have not been to Houston's in quite some time and will not be going back. WORST service I have ever had.  The waitress took our order, someone else delivered it.  Not once did she ever come over and see if our meal was ok or if we needed anything.  I had to ask another waitress for a glass of water and another drink.  She stood at one table for at least 10 minutes, chatting it up with them. We were ready to leave, so I had to ask the hostess for a box and our check.  She then walked by and gave us a weird look, like it was odd that we asked someone else for help.  Food was OK, but this was the most ridiculous \"service\" or lack thereof that I have ever encountered at what is supposed to be a \"nicer\" restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a gift certificate for this place for around a year of so.  We finally decided to give it a try Friday evening.  There was a wait as to be expected it was around 45 minutes.  We waited in the area next to the bar.  The server was a little slow in getting to us in this area.  We got waters and then some bread shortly afterwards.  This area can be a little cramped.  There was a D head standing in the middle of the walking area.  People had to walk around him and he was a bit obnoxious too.  I was glad to be seated because I was tired of hearing him.  

We got the menu and checked it over.  Since we had a bread appetizer already we wanted to do the main course.  My better half had a sandwhich.  She said it was really good.  

I got the filet and it was really good.  I have traveled all over the USA and tried filet when stopping in cities.  The Houston's filet is one of the best I have had.  It was just really tender and flavourful.  I got a side of mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The side was a tad small.  I think next time I will ask for more broccoli even if there is a small charge.  

I got the brownie dessert minus the ice cream.  It was really good.  It was not to sweet and had a hint of coffee flavour in it.  

Overall the food was good.  The server was excellent.  Except the D head in the waiting area this was a great and fantastic visit.  We came without a reservation.  When we comeback we will make a reservation a few weeks in advance.

I recommend this place.  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Always a good meal and great atmosphere, my only issue is the prices have crept up to where it's not the value it once was.  Also, I don't know why the hostess can't do a better job of estimating how long a wait your table will be."}
{"text":"Expensive and bad service. Kids meal not printed. You get a nice surprise if $9 for a portion smaller than a happy meal. You are better off at Wallys."}
{"text":"I like Houstons, but the service and attention to details are dropping.. Yesterday was the 2nd time service was so so..

The Manager needs to pick up the staffs game.. Slow refills, dishes left on the table, no one at front counter."}
{"text":"We came to Houston's to have their secret chicken tender appetizer, and it did not disappoint. Another excellent, melt in your mouth white breast meat tender coated in tempura batter, with the same awesome horseradish infused honey mustard sauce and bbq sauce, with shoestring fries included. And the wait staff were all very attractive. Wow!"}
{"text":"This is a phenomenal looking spot. The wait staff were very helpful and professional. We had a reservation and still waited an extra 20 minutes. I can understand that as it was fathers day, just thought they could have done a better job with reservations. 

The food was great looking bit my filet was under cooked and the mashed potatoes were just warm. Once that was corrected the food was fabulous! 
Great experience and good food
Only 2 reasons that I didn't give it 5 stars, the wait time to sit and the key lime pie was disappointing."}
{"text":"Houston's is an incredible restaurant with an unparalleled commitment to service and quality. I actually used to work there more than 20 years ago and it is still one of my wife and I favorite restaurants. The ambiance is upscale but you can still feel comfortable in casual attire. The service is always 5 star the quality of food and preparation is excellent. A couple of our favorites include the grilled artichoke, house salad, Ahi Tuna appetizer, grilled chicken and kale salad, house made veggie burger (one of my all time favorites) and the chicken tortilla soup is the best of anywhere. We visit every couple months and they never let us down. Make sure to go early as there is usually a wait, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good.  The spinach and artichoke dip is really creamy and tasty.  For main courses, I've had the cheeseburger and ribs.  The cheeseburger had a juicy patty and a soft bun that soaked up all of the juices.  The ribs were extremely tender with the meat falling off the bone.  I believe they were pork ribs and were served wet with a sweet bbq sauce.  The coleslaw was great...mayo base so it was pretty creamy.  The fries are awesome.  Similar to shoestring fries and perfectly salted.  Also, I've had a bite of the filet and it was pretty darn good.  Cooked medium and really tender.

This place loses stars though because the service is really hit or miss.  The waiters and waitresses can be really knowledgeable, but they go missing during times and can't be found when you need refills, more ketchup, etc.

The other thing that takes off a star is just the idea that this place serves sushi.  I'm completely turned off by that and really don't think sushi and an American steakhouse should mix."}
{"text":"Houston's always has consistently very good food.  The service is pretty decent, though I have had a few incidences of a snotty bartender.  I have eaten everything from the smoked salmon appetizer, to the tuna salad, to a steak dinner and it was always well presented and delicious.  The drinks are a bit on the pricey side, but I guess that is to be expected at a nice restaurant in Scottsdale.  

The atmosphere is great if you want an intimate setting.  The booths are cozy and arranged so you don't hear 3 other tables' conversations.  Last time I went they had a very pleasant Jazz band playing in the background.  Also, the bar is a great place to sit if you are alone and just want a good meal and a drink.  

I should also note this is a very busy restaurant and the wait times can be long.  If you have a big party or want dinner on the weekends, I recommend booking a reservation."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place.  It's romantic and the deep wood inside with low light 
Great menu and amazing service.  
Famous for the Rotisserie chicken or the prime rib sandwich I love the grilled artichokes make a reservation it's a busy place"}
{"text":"My wife has always liked Houston's (for a chain, she says), so we finally went together recently.  I admit the ambiance was nice, quiet and subdued, but our server and my dinner were very underwhelming.  I had the Hickory Burger, but I consider myself to be a sort of hamburger connoisseur, so maybe that was too much pressure to put on Houston's.  My wife still enjoys it there though...so we'll probably go back again."}
{"text":"I have worked in many restaurants.  The golden rule is always make sure take out orders are correct,  because once a customer gets home and finds out the order is wrong, it's very, very difficult to fix the problem.  I have been going to Houston's for over 15 years.  And when dining in , it's almost certainly an excellent experience.  This time I ordered takeout,  and all items were incorrect, meat extremely undercooked and requested condiments did not accompany the order. I know better than to leave a restaurant without checking my order. But when you pay nearly $20 for a well done burger you don't expect to wait 40 min, when you are told 20, and you don't expect that your burger will be nearly raw when you get home.  Houston's is known for consistency and quality food. Normally I would give a \"hall pass\" on this one, but nothing makes me angrier than paying top dollar and having to go home to recook undercooked food, only to then throw it out. I will be back to Houston's, for dine in only. Take out, never again."}
{"text":"I would be remiss to not share what a lovely experience I had today at lunch, thanks to all the wonderful staff at Houstons. Kyle the manager was attentive and personable beyond expectation...even as he was busily helping to man the bar with the lovely bartender (whose name I unfortunately missed) who looked after me. 

Coming from San Diego, I can only say that the quality of food and service here are superlative. You will feel comfortable, warmed and welcomed all while getting to enjoy gorgeous, elevated American food. 

Bravo. Will be back as fast as possible!

Sara"}
{"text":"I have visited Houstons many times and the service and food are always of a high standard. The starters or appetisers are in my opinion to be shared and I highly recommend the baby back ribs. So tender they just fall away from the bone. I have not tried the apple cobbler myself but it has come highly recommended.... The bar had a wonderful atmosphere when busy and you can eat there too. Sometimes a better option of restaurant packed. They do not take reservations for parties over 4 so depending the night the wait could be very long. I would advise eating later to reduce the wait."}
{"text":"Went here after a concert. Plentiful parking, easy access off Scottsdale Rd. We got right in, the place was mostly empty. I think I saw about 10 other tables being used, all scattered around the restaurant. 

The service was good. Food delivery time was 12 minutes from order to table. Everything was as ordered. I had the french dip and fries.

Long before I ever heard of this chain I decided I didn't like those ultra thin fries, that are served here. When the menu described \"hand cut\" fries I was expecting what is commonly called \"steak fries.\" They were tasty but I don't like ultra skinny fries.

The french dip was serves with juice on the side. The beef was tasty and tender, much better than all the others I've had in the valley, except maybe for a different concept of the same sandwich is the Beef on Weck at Joe's Diner is more tender and tasty. 

Coffee after was also tasty. Our waiter did a top notch job of keeping our glasses filled  but not being to intrusive.

I will return to this location."}
{"text":"Fantastic! It's been a while since I've been here, and that has to change.  Why?  Great Malbec, to start. 

The rotisserie chicken was quite delicious, the baked potato-great, but what truly impressed me the most was how conversational and professional the staff was tonight.  

Bryn behind the bar was such a pleasure and their manager, Kyle, was equally as courteous.  It's rare you find people like this in the restaurant industry.

Houston's will always be a great place for me and my friends and family."}
{"text":"It's been kind of one of our traditions lately... lunch at Houston's and then a movie at Fashion Square mall.  My mom and I love just spending that time together and I always look forward to it.  After reading some of the negative reviews here, I'm  just blown away.  I don't understand how anyone could have a bad experience.  I've eaten here dozens of times and every single time has been great.  The service is top-notch, the place is beautiful and the food is exceptionally good!!!"}
{"text":"Always top notch food and service. Elegant without being stuffy. Hawaiin Ribeye is always a go to dish. Love this place."}
{"text":"As a group of scattered friends we have been meeting once a year around the holidays for dinner. For the past 30 plus years we have always eaten at Don and Charlie's. Last year we finally realized that they were just not up to par anymore. We took a chance and tried Houston's. Typical Scottsdale eatery. Range Rovers, posers and people not at all concerned with paying WAY too much for average food. Hamburger, pork chop, kale salad and ribs. It was just ok. Have had better for much, much less money. First go around with the pork chop plate, the potatoes were cold. Got a replacement and they tried to charge for them. No pre-dinner anything. We asked for bread and they brought a \"bread service\" which is 4 slices of rosemary bread. $1 on the bill. Really? The ribs were pretty good but at $28 they should have been. Have had much better for a little more than half of that. The staff was attentive and very friendly, no problem there. Needless to say, we will be shopping around again next year."}
{"text":"Its closer for me to go to Hillstone, on Camelback but I drive to Scottsdale anyway. To me Houston's has a great atmosphere. People are more relaxed and not so stuffed shirt like Hillstone. Besides.....the wine list alone is worth the trip. The food menu is the same as Hillstone but a dollar or two less on many items (Why I can't tell ya). I just love this place. Never a bad time and always food cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Love this place for strange reasons I guess... I love their cole slaw, fries, and burgers! Its sort of a swanky joint, and you wouldn't think the items I mentioned would be that great... But, they are! Classy atmosphere, other fare is pretty good as well. Good place to hang and have a drink too, especially if you have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"By far the biggest disappointment I've experienced dinning out. Our waitress when asked about alternate options with ordering salad (adding steak) just told us absolutely no, it would just be meat on top of a salad. Never had a steak house type restaurant that refused to put steak on a salad before. My boyfriend ask for a medium rare steak and got very rare steak. The side of broccoli was completely tasteless and my lemonade was so bitter I could hardly drink it. I drink lemonade every day by the way and so I have a good idea of how it should taste. We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Hands down this is the restaurant I frequent the most. The prices are on point. The service is second to none and they always remember my name! For a chain restaurant I have never been more impressed. The artichokes are phenomenal, the caesar salad with house made dressing, the burger, the french dip, ahi tuna, ribs, roasted chicken, the drinks! The quality control is top notch. I have never experienced a cold dish or a bad meal. You can make a reservation, or if you don't have one you will never likely wait more then 30-45 minutes to be seated. In the mean time, servers will come around to get you started with a beverage. I wish more restaurants would follow Houston business model in terms of quality control, customer service, and good food. For an all around good meal this is the place to visit."}
{"text":"Having been regulars for the past 10 years, last spring, my family and I went to eat there for a celebration. We were surprised to see the change in the layout of the restaurant. There was more  production of noise which was very distracting because the booths were awkwardly shaped (a quarter circle and the rest in chairs) for three people that you can hear your neighbor's conversation while waiting for your meal. The menu was downsized and it didn't have the quality selections that my family and I use to chose from so, for me, I settled for a mushroom burger. We were not pleased with the service either because they did a tag-team version so we were confused on who was \"helping\" us and it was taking a while to ask for a simple glass of water. We found it very rude when they would take our plates away without even bother asking. I did not enjoy my meal that day and we do not plan on returning to this poorly, functioned restaurant."}
{"text":"What happened to Houstons???  I used to love this place and went back last week after a couple of years and had a terrible experience! To be fair the food was very good however the service ruined everything.  Our seemingly high-school aged waitress seemed outmatched for the task at hand, after serving our appetizer she was AWOL was over 20 minutes while we waited and waited and waited just to order dinner.  There were no busboys filling waters, no managers walking the floor, in fact there didn't seem to be an employee in the building over 16 years old.  Finally we placed our order and once served, two of the four entrees had to be sent back; one for the wrong temp and a plate of ribs was completely cold.  Then that was it for 20 minutes, she took the two meals and was AWOL again.  Now two of us were completely finished eating and still no sign of the other entrees or waitress (or busboy or manager or anyone else).  We finally figured out who the manager was and flagged her over to explain the situation.  I explained that the waitress had no help, no one running food, no one filling glasses, no manager checking on the patrons.  Although apologetic she threw the waitress under the bus and wholly blamed her.  Not only was this unprofessional it wasn't true, where the hell was the manager all night?  This was literally the first time we saw her on the floor.  Terrible service, TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT, but maybe they don't teach managing restaurants until high school.  What a shame!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Steve was our server. Very friendly and attentive. We ordered spinach dip very yummy. Traditional salad is very good with butter milk dressing. Bread is excellent. Prime rib was so good. Very tender and flavorful. I am very impressed."}
{"text":"Houston's is simply a perfect restaurant. It's consistently delicious and the service and ambiance are just outstanding. It's comfy and relaxing, a little dark- but just the right amount. 

The food is is awesome, I'm a devotee of the French dip, it's perfect in every way. My favorite thing there is their world class margaritas. They are hand made using fresh limes to order and they are stupendous. 

In summary- this place is a gem.  Consistently consistent- serving up great food. You cannot go wrong here."}
{"text":"Uses is a great restaurant great atmosphere into better for us or me to people like a date rape the ribs on par with the best in the world the number by two or 10 I suggest you try uses and finish it enjoy every moment of it"}
{"text":"Brought out of town clients for lunch.  Have done so before and always been solid choice enjoyed by all.  Had a party of 6. Talked up the artichokes only to be told not available but the Brussels sprouts were just as good.  They were not.  Dry bland, no one at table enjoyed.  Meals arrived in timely fashion and we're all good.  A few minutes into the meal 4 in our party were looking at a video on a cell phone.  Without notice waiter took/cleared 2 of the plates and walked away.  One being my own which was a burger with 2 bites taken out of it and had not touched the fries.  My client had eaten less than half of a french dip.    My client seemed embarrassed so I did not make a big deal or mention anything to waiter and we awkwardly joked about it. Not sure if we were being rushed or waiter just blew it.   On way out I discretely asked to speak to a manager.  Was told it would be a few minutes and with clients waiting outside in the heat, I left.  Pretty disappointed as was trying to make good impression with clients."}
{"text":"What can I say? I love it here...so much so, that you can pretty much find me there at least once during a Thursday, Friday or Saturday  afternoon/evening. They are not the most affordable option in town (e.g., a burger, glass of wine + tip = approx. $30 meal) but, they've got the burger and wine list down to a science. And, Saturday's you've got a great option for a Texas Firehouse Chili Cheeseburger that is out of this world!

I usually sit at the bar;  where I can usually stir up conversation with any of the other Guests looking for a damn good meal; or one of the personable bartenders (Raini, Rachel, Jason and Eric are all fabulous) or simply take in a quick light bite and view the latest sporting event on one of the HD televisions.

It really is fabulous! Stop by - check it out for yourself and tell them Shannan sent you!"}
{"text":"Get the shrimp cocktail, French dip and a key lime pie. Wow, insane. This place has been one of my favorite restaurants I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of great things about this place and the Hillstone group in general ever since I moved here so I finally went to Houston's and was disapointed.  The menu was a bore and a snore and lacking options which is fine if the few things you have on the menu are truly amazing.  I ordered the filet mignon by default because there wasn't anything else that grabbed my attention.  Also everyone said the steaks were amazing.  When the food got there I was excited.  The steak looked beautiful and when I cut into it, it looked like a perfect medium rare.  I was impressed until I took a bite.  Yikes.  I don't know if it was just the particular piece of meat I had or what but the taste was weird and bad.  It had the taste that steak gets when you try and re-heat it in the microwave.  I tried several bites hoping it would get better and it didn't.  Luckily the monster baked potatoe was great.  I am not sure if my steak was undercooked then they tried to quickly compensate and nuke it real quick.  I have serious doubts that any established steakhouse would do that but.... something was off about my steak.  The boyfriend got the ribs whom the server swore were the best in town. Lies.  Ribs were not fall off the bone tender and not very meaty.  On the positives portions were huge so you get a good value for the price... that is if you like what you're eating.  I probably will not return even though I feel I should give the steak another try.  Hillstone group so far is just mehhh"}
{"text":"Okay food, Convenient Location, Staff was extremely rude I waited at my table for over half hour before I was even greeted by waiter.
I didn't really care much for the food or the service."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go and had to wait awkwardly in the crowded bar area while they finished the order...  Was the french dip worth the wait? Yes. The salad? No."}
{"text":"Here's an example of how much I love Houston's: I could actually tell the difference between head chefs (I remember very well the day I learned that Alex Van Uum switched to the ugly sister at 24th and Camelback).  I have someone who can vouch for me on this.

Head chef notwithstanding, this is an absolute lock.  If you want a delicious dinner (or lunch) there is no question that you'll get it at Houston's.  And I will make the bold claim here: they serve the best cheeseburger in the state.  When the fries are right, they are amazing--thin yet crispy and deliciously salty on the outside but steamy and soft in the middle.  Yet it's the cheeseburger that gets my vote every time.  And this is in spite of the fact that I have had the hawaiian rib eye (amazing), the chicken sandwich (delightful), the prime rib sandwich (a savory taste sensation) and even remember fondly the best pork chops I've ever had at a restaurant, back when they served them.  (Butterflied with--yes--a tab of butter melted across the top of each side.  Fuck.)  But it ain't broke, so every time I get the cheeseburger, medium, no onions, and the juices ooze out to form an oh-so-tempting puddle on my plate--generally the only evidence that something edible even graced the plate in the first place.  Trust me on this.

Appetizers: The smoked salmon appetizer is fucking ridiculously good.  And I don't even like salmon.  Also the chicago-style spinach dip.  For dessert, if they still serve the warm five nut brownie, get it.

Sides: if they offer the braised cabbage, go for it.  The brussels sprouts are also a delight.

Wait: get over it.  Dress relatively nicely because they claim to have a dress code.

Bottom line: one sure way to know if someone is a moron is if they don't like Houston's."}
{"text":"First trip, very good. Service was excellent. Had the Traditional salad, and being Sunday the Fire House Chili was being served. Probably the best chili I've had.The entree was Seared Ahi Tuna cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Most people know Houston's. Its a good standby. The service is always great and I love how the servers work as a team. Houston's has fantastic burgers if you didn't know. 

Tip: they serve a strawberry shortcake for dessert in the summer. Its perfect & not too sweet! The strawberries are gynormous and served atop a house made poppyseed shortcake w/ fresh whipped cream! Mouth watering yet? 

Oh and one more tip: I don't know why they don't have this on the menu, but you can order beer-battered chicken fingers. Order extra crispy. Yum! 

Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Always exceptional service. Nicer restaurant but not stuffy for being in Scottsdale. Hands down the best French dip sandwich. Perfect medium rare shaved thinly with a delicious au jus and horseradish sauce. The five nut brownie is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"We've been eating at Houston's as long as we've been in Arizona (15+ years).  I don't know that we've ever had a bad meal.  The burgers are out of this world.  The veggie burgers could win any carnivore's heart.  The ice cream sundae is perfection - chocolate ganache that isn't hot and doesn't turn my decadence into soupiness?  Yes, please."}
{"text":"Houston's has been on my list of must-vist restaurants for a long time.  I wish I wouldn't have waited so long!  I wasn't sure of the appropriate dress, so I wore a skirt and the men in the family wore dress pants.  We walked in and the atmosphere was dark and ritzy and very \"happenin'\".  However, we saw people there in shorts, t-shirts, ball caps and dressy clothes.  Hm.  I would think a place this nice all people would dress a little nicer - oh well.  The menu is limited, but does have a little of everything.  We ordered the Hawaiian ribeye, loaded baked potato, prime rib, filet, baked beans and the veggie plate.  Everything was wonderful.  The veggie plate is not your usual veggie plate - very unique items and a barley salad that is out of this world.  The prices aren't bad either.  We will definately be back!"}
{"text":"A friend and I came to dine at this restaurant and waited 45 minutes for a table. When it came to being seated the manager told us that they had a dress code and having cleavage was not acceptable. I have never been more offended as a woman enduring this sexist attitude."}
{"text":"It had been a while since I have been to Houston's. I have always enjoyed it there. This trip was no different. Good quality food and good service. This trip it was louder than I remember though. We had a party of 5 and all of us thought the food was really good. Service was genuine and more than adequate. Price point for the quality is on target. Admittedly, my wife and I thought the trimmed down menu was too basic and too small but otherwise it was a nice evening. Houston's used to have an incredible baked potato soup which according to our server, is gone forever.....oh well still a good place to have dinner. Very consistent with the food quality."}
{"text":"This is not a good option for kids at all my family and I were recently in the area for a football game and decided to go here for lunch with my picky kid we asked at the front desk for a kids menu and they didn't have one but they said that they have options that kids might like so my son ordered the chicken fry thing that they said was like chicken fingers! So we were ok, but then they came out with some fancy looking (not normal chicken fingers) thing it was not good at all and my kid was not happy so I think that they should implement a kids menu to make the place more family style so the whole family could enjoy! But the adults food was great I would recommend for adults but not kids until they get a kids menu!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, it is very similar to Hillstone at the Biltmore...The ambiance is great - dark and not too loud, AMAZING service, the waiters and waitresses here are seriously the best. Music is always good and not too loud. My favorite thing on the menu is the ribs, they fall off the bone and the sauce is perfection. The burger is also one of the best burgers you will ever have!"}
{"text":"My place for a steak anywhere and always.

Their service is consistently good and their food quality is top notch.  

In 20 plus years of dining with them I've only had 2 mediocre steaks and both times the staff exceeded our expectations in correcting the matter.  Wine selection used to be better with more Spanish and Argentine options.  Get rid of the Malbec che.  Es puro pedo.  Dame Rioja, Bonarda o Cabernet."}
{"text":"The ambulance is fantastic here and the food is delicious! Great place to meet to catch up with friends or even a date night. The salads are very large and you can easily share."}
{"text":"Oh..my..goodness..The Filet Mignon Thai Salad was worth going for , twice on a two day stay 
there."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Scottsdale and decided to try Houston's.  It was one of the finest dining experiences of my life.  The restaurant was lovely, the food was excellent and our server, Jackie, was the best.  Also, the manager Kyle is amazing.  Thanks for everything, Jackie and Kyle."}
{"text":"I have to go every time I am in Scottsdale, and I finally got to bring the husband this last time. We enjoyed a late lunch that started with a great chopin martini, and a generous serving of the grilled artichoke appetizer. Delicious!! Next, I had the salmon with the vegetable of the day which on this day was asparagus steamed and then chilled and topped with rock salt and hollandaise - I am obsessed with this ever since and I am going to try and recreate it at home this weekend. The salmon was perfect and a nice sized portion. My husband wanted the ahi sandwich but it was sold out, so he had the fried fish one, and he really enjoyed it. This is a can't miss place, just go!"}
{"text":"We come here every week, and it seems as though the service is going down hill. If something is prepared incorrectly the wait staff does not seem to care. When finished with the meal they ask if you want an additional glass of wine, not attentive. Food is always prepared well as long as you are aware of how Houstons prepares it."}
{"text":"Good service is a rarity these days. Too many places are focused on sub optimal food and just down right bad service. Houstons was a pleasant surprise! The food was very well cooked and proportioned. I couldn't believe how good the Ruby Red Trout was. My wife's dinner was just as delicious according to her. And the service,  wow! These folks are on top of it. I couldn't believe how attentive they were,  especially for a chain. 

I will start making the place a routine stop. While it's a bit pricey, you can't beat the service and the food. Do yourself a favor and go enjoy a good dinner."}
{"text":"Their steak should be pretty well but system of reception should have issues for parties over 5 persons. Because they have regular seats for two or four persons in general but they have only one or two seats for 5 persons. However if reception would try to fill the party of 5 or over in the seat, they should wait to use or assign the seat for new customers which was used by other party with 3 or 4 persons. Next seat may be open in 5 minutes or close but they did not try to keep those seats for 5 persons of us, according to that behavior only we had to wait 1 hour and 15 minutes because of waiting just largest space for 5 persons. 
I recommend Houston's to change how to fill seats with new customer like our case."}
{"text":"I will start this off by saying this was one of the strangest dining experiences I've had. 

My wife and I went there with two other friends a few weeks ago. So, first, we go to order the appetizer. We put in for two appetizers, one including the grilled artichokes (not realizing it is not in season). Our waitress says ok and a little while later one of the appetizers comes out. We ask about the artichokes and she tells us they don't have them it's not in season. Well..why didn't you tell us that 10 minutes ago when we ordered them and you said ok?????

Anyways, then we go to order the entree. My friend orders the Arctic Char, which we were told they were out of as they just sold the last one (it's 6:15p on a Monday). Then the ladies try to order the Prime Rib. Well...turns out the kitchen *just placed a new Rib on the rack and it's going to be 40 minutes if we want that. Keep in mind this is a nice restaurant with a limited menu, so at this point the question really becomes what do you have available? (I was never a waiter, but shouldn't the staff tell you up front about all the menu issues rather than wait for customers to order and then say oh we don't have that?)

Then HERE is the strangest part, although relatively trivial. My friend has a Manhattan and is midway through his drink. Our waitress comes around, doesn't speak, but picks up his cocktail, casually transfers it to a new, chilled glass and walks away. MID COCKTAIL! I would have thought that was weird had she asked to do it, let alone just pickup and mess with someones drink. We had a good laugh about that. I have never seen that before. 

At the end of our meal, our waitress clearly knew we were upset about the menu issues, so she starts laying down forks. We thought the meal was over but turns out they were giving us 2 free desserts for the trouble. I understand and appreciate the gesture, but the 2 desserts that came out were based on the presumption that:

1. We wanted to stay a while longer
2. We actually wanted dessert

Why not just comp the $12 appetizer?

In all, this was not a horrible dinner (food was good) but we don't go out to nice places like this all that often. So, when we do, I think it's fair to expect a level of service that warrants spending north of $100 and this was certainly not the case. While I used to love coming to this restaurant, I doubt we will return. Too many other options just down the street."}
{"text":"We love Houston's!!  They have a great cocktail menu (vespers and Mi Sueno) and the kale salad and rotisserie chicken is awesome.  We love their brussel sprouts and we scout out good brussel sprouts.  Their salmon appetizer is also a lite fare.  The service is wonderful and the ambience.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here. Impeccable service, every item on the menu is full of flavor. The most charming atmosphere and I never get tired of any dish. My go to is the artichoke appetizer, salmon entree, coleslaw on the side, fries (they are perfect here), and finish with the hot fudge Sunday.

Pro tip:  my Perrier always comes in a perfectly chilled glass."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for Valentine's Day. Great overall experience. The atmosphere is very pleasant, the servers are very attentive and friendly and the food.... Where do I even start? One of the best steaks I've ever had in my life. The center cut filet that I had could practically be cut with just my fork. 

Major kudos go to Houston's for the level of their food in comparison to their price. They are definitely a high end steak house so be prepared to spend a little extra but unlike most high end steak houses everything isn't ala cart. I don't mind paying $43 for an amazing steak especially when it comes with equally amazing mash potatoes and broccoli. 

Overall, we got an appetizer, prime rib, center cut filet with sides on both and some alcoholic drinks and our bill was a little over $100. I'll take that all day every day. Great experience. Great food and great price for the high quality of food we received. I'll definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"Mmmm! I am officially a huge fan of Houston's now. I've been to sister restaurant, The Rutherford Grill in Napa, and Houston's was just as good.

The place was popping tonight, and it is a Wednesday. It was dark and upbeat, but not stuffy by any means. The menu had many delicious options - it was difficult to make a decision.

I started with a side salad with bleu cheese. It was crazy good. It had a housemade bleu and croutons, and even had corn in it. Different and scrumptious.

For my main course, I had their baby back ribs. These ribs were easily the best I've ever had (sorry Trail Dust). They were beyond fall off the bone they were so tender. The shoe string fries it came with were so perfectly done, they didn't even require ketchup. My wife had the Thai Noodle Chicken Salad, which she dubbed as the greatest salad she has ever had. My mother had the Rotisserie Chicken and Couscous. She was also very happy with her meal.

For dessert we shared the Belgian Hot Fudge Sundae with Candied Pecans. Damn it was sinfully delicious.

All in all, a perfect meal. 5 stars, with ease."}
{"text":"We were so pleased with our visit to Houston's. I had the Steak & Thai salad and my Husband had the salmon. We were exhausted after a road trip in from Colorado and in some need of some serious good food! Amen! From the beginning of our experience to the end it was spot on! Service was EXCEPTIONAL! The food was absolutely delicious! Yummm!"}
{"text":"Do Not Go if you are celebrating a birthday.  They have a most unusual attitude regarding people celebrating birthday's.  

First let me say, I am a fan of Houstons & went there hoping for a 5 star experience for my husband's birthday.
It was very nice... We liked the food & wine. The server was lovely. They key lime pie, which is always a great signature dish was out of season, so that was disappointing. If you want key lime pie, call ahead & ask.

It was my husbands birthday & I made a point of telling the waiter at the beginning of the meal...  
We ordered a dessert for each of us & they brought it out.  That was it no candles,
nothing at all.  So on the way out I asked the hostess up front about my experience & she told me, \"we don't make a big deal out of birthdays\"  OKAY... So the next night we went to Cafe Monarch & they DO make a big deal out of celebrating birthdays, plus their food was beyond fabulous!

So from now on when I am in the Phoenix or Scottsdale area... I will order my pie from the Pie Snob &  I will by-pass Houston's & go to my new favorite... Cafe Monarch. 

I do like to Celebrate Birthdays:)"}
{"text":"I have to say that I have been a long term patron of Houston's but based on their changing policies I will never return.  I have gone to this location once a week for the last 8 years.  Last night I was there with my family (minus 1 who was home sick).  After waiting an hour to be seated and having a very nice dinner, I tried to order a hamburger to go for my daughter.  I was informed that their policy is no take outs during busy periods.  While I understand this for call in orders, I do not understand it for those who have dined at the restaurant and simply want to take something home to a child who was unable to come to the restaurant.  Their inflexibility has definitely cost them my business going forward.  There are too many good restaurants in Scottsdale to have to put up with such a short sited policy."}
{"text":"Love this place. Wish there was one in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Houston is a great restaurant for date night. Hillstone (on Camelback) is also a part of this group. I frequent Houston's for the pork chop! Talk about a creature of habit. I loooove the pork chop! It is generally served with broccoli (seasonal veggies) and mashed potatoes. I have yet to eat the whole chop!!! But man, trying to is heaven!!! I have, on occasion, tried other dishes. I haven't had a bad experience in the 2 1/2 years that I have been coming to Houston's. By chance, if you have to send an entree back, they have an open kitchen. You can rest assure that you won't get any extra sauce!

The staff are always pleasant, making sure that guests have a superb experience. Please make a reservation to save yourself some time. This place is almost always crowded...YES, even  the bar area."}
{"text":"Our party of four met at Houston's for a late lunch this week.  The service was excellent and the food was very good, though over priced ($14 for a small plate of veggies? ), but we all left with the same complaint, \"Why do they play such loud music?!\"   We could barely hear each other despite the fact that the restaurant was nearly empty.    The ambiance of Houston's seemed to conflict with loud music overhead -- I won't be back, even if eating alone."}
{"text":"Make sure u ask for Tracy  at the bar ... She's a miracle worker .... Best drinks ever !!!"}
{"text":"chicken tenders platter is from the heavens. so are the burgers, spinach artichoke dip, french fries, tortilla soup, asian chicken salad - the list goes on and on.....

this location has been here forever and I don't see anything changing - minimum 30 minute wait on a thurs/fri/sat night.

my friends and i joke that it's the best restaurant on this planet. not really sure how much of a joke it is.

if you want VERY GOOD FOOD, go here. you will NOT be disappointed! sure, the price tag's a little on the heavier side but that's the price for culinary art."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. The girl who brought out our food was obviously new but super sweet. When we visit again this will definitely be our first stop."}
{"text":"I went there with friends on a Friday night, good ambiance, good food, great service! definitely I will go back"}
{"text":"About 13, 14 years ago I was living in the Orlando area and there was a Houston's in Winter Park, I think.  I don't see it on their website anymore, but my coworkers and I would treat ourselves once a month and go to Houston's and enjoy the gracious service, delicious food, and I believe that one had a lovely deck overlooking a pond.  

When our anniversary rolled around this year, Houston's came to mind as a place to revisit.  It's still the same classy, comfortable interior and the service is perfect.  Our main server, Russell, was attentive and friendly, and the woman who brought out our appetizer had a quick wit because as she came around the corner I was holding a cocktail in each hand and said, \"I'm having both drinks tonight\" and she said, \"Well you have to taste test them, right?\"  Absolutely!

Speaking of those cocktails, mine was the elder collins ($13) and it went down way too quickly.  That's a nice summertime drink for sure.  My husband had the Manhattan ($12) which both of us enjoyed (I just had a sip, I swear) and you can tell we don't get out to classier restaurants much because I was so impressed that halfway through the drink, Russell stopped by to pour it into a freshly chilled glass.  That was a nice touch.  

We then shared the Hawaiian ribeye ($36) which is worth every penny.  Full of flavor and cooked a perfect medium rare, it was fantastic.  We chose fries for the side and those were delicious as well.  We didn't make a reservation, but got there with the geriatric crew and golfers for an early dinner at 4:30 on a Saturday.  We had no problem getting a table then, but by the time we were finished the place was full and people were waiting.  I'm glad to see they are still a wonderful place to go out for dinner.  We need to return more often.  Thank you, Houston's, for a very nice anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"Great food and service. One of my favorite restaurants to go to when I visit Phoenix. The artichoke, kale salad, coleslaw, and ribs are all good choices."}
{"text":"Hands down the most embarrassing and demoralizing experience I have ever had at a restaurant. After bringing a party of 5 to the restaurant to dine for my girlfriends birthday we were notified by the staff that were could not eat there due to one of the girls tank tops being above belly level. After offering the solution to switch shirts with another girl in the party we were told that the \"damage had been done\" because people in the restaurant had already seen what she was wearing... are you kidding me?? They offered her an extra large black shirt for her to  wear as the only option to stay for a girl that stands 5'2\" and would make a mockery of her as it had a name tag on it and stuck out like a soar thumb. Mind you this is AFTER we put an order in. Needless to say, we immediately cancelled the order and proceeded to leave. Words can't explain how poorly that situation was handled by the management and staff for a restaurant that has such high reviews.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Houstons, although not the priciest is the best comfort food restaurant in scottsdale! The food is fantastic (some may even say to die for) but that is only one aspect of Houstons. The real reason to go to Houstons is the same reason your wife wants to go to the spa; you want to be pampered and thats what Houstons does. They are the best pamperers in town who also happen to serve great food. The next time your wife wants to go to the spa tell her no. Tell her Houstons."}
{"text":"What more relaxing atmosphere is there than Houston's for lunch? I assure you there is none. With no reservations and a busy Friday crowd, we were greeted by friendly staff and seated at the choicest of tables with no delay. The entire restaurant has a warm, glowing ambiance. The first thing that captured my attention was the lighting throughout. The dining room  chandeliers resemble great big pine cones! Now that might not mean alot to some, but it makes a little mountain girl like me feel right at home. The entire staff is top notch. So attentive, the entire team just Blesses you from the moment you arrive. Our waitstaff was just charming. Her name is Shereen. She is very professional,  knowledgeable of the menu and has a style all her own. Today I had a Crispy Chicken Salad. Amazing! I have never had lightly-breaded crispy chicken so tender and juicy it melts in your mouth... My friend had a Hickory Burger with homemade fries - piled high with cheddar and bacon. Plate presentation is phenomenal. No matter how hungry you are, I can only imagine that once your meal arrives, that you will be delighted and literally stunned long enough to remember to get a picture. I will highly recommend to all. Do keep in mind ~ if time is a constraint for you, might call ahead."}
{"text":"This ty loves the thai steak and noodle salad. Holy shizzz!!!
Lunchtime was beyond busy but we arrived just before the rush. Our waitress Bryn was fantastic and she made the experience that much better . Houstons where have you been my entire life?"}
{"text":"My first time to Houston's and I really wanted to have a glowing review.  There were 5 of us celebrating a friends birthday at lunch on a Monday.  One member of our party ordered fish & chips and was told they don't have that item on Monday, 2nd member ordered a ahi tuna burger and was told they don't have that available either as \"we use the left over pieces of the tuna that are not pretty and there isn't enough to use today\".  What??!!  Third member ordered the ahi tuna salad (asking if the \"pretty\" parts of the tuna were used) and asked for dressing on the side.  Our waiter explained they could not accommodate that request but they could lightly dress it.  What??!!  The salad was served overly dressed (in my opinion) with the tuna served on the side.  Are the salads \"pre-dressed\"?  She ate the tuna, but not the salad.  I ordered the grilled artichoke - it was excellent.  Two members ordered the \"bean burger\" (which we were told is the best in the city) and thought it was ok.  I fault them - you ordered a bean burger!!!  Would I go back?  Maybe, not sure.  How can all these great reviews be wrong.  Left feeling guilty that I choose this venue to celebrate my friends special day."}
{"text":"I am soooooo confused why this place has good reviews? Stumped actually, no.. aphauled. 

Ive eaten here a few times because my mom likes this place. Why? ...Because she lives off lettuce and has never tried anything else here. She like the turkey gizzards, she has no opinion. 

So I went there and got a salad, dressing was pretty gross. My brother got a burger that was actually raw, so he took it back. 

So he gets the burger back and now............

The lettuce was hot wilted the bun was soggy and the cheese was still in the shape of grated cheese. 

This was obviously put in the microwave, topping and all. Completely disgusting!!!!!

I had chicken there too and it was like the turkey on Nation Lampoon's Christmas Vacation!!!

If you remember that scene, that is exactly what happened here"}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off for the past few years. The food is excellent and service is impeccable. I not only observe the behaviour but also body-language of the servers. Here, the servers behave as though it really does not matter if the table is assigned to a particular server. Many times, servers--multiple--other than our designated server would come and check to see if we needed anymore beverages, condiments, etc.  Their service was exceptional.

As for the food, the taste was amazing. Well prepared with right temperature and good texture with superb presentation.  

Well done!"}
{"text":"i have yet to order something that i have disliked. 
my favorite is the thai steak noodle salad- it's a must order. the only time i was disappointed was when i discovered their salsa was just Pace from a jar. 

AND the service is ALWAYS great. They stand behind the quality of their food and if it's below standard, they will take care of you! I always look forward to going to Houston's."}
{"text":"Been coming here once, twice, or even 4 times a week. Take-outs too. Favorite restaurant. This was also my deceased brothers all time favorite. We came in today to only be sexually harassed by the hostess whose worked there for years and the female manager. Tonight I expressed they lost a value customer and we will never set our feet in their restaurant again. So many birthdays, celebrations, etc will never be the same. #metoo #boycott #howdareyouhoustons"}
{"text":"Having grown up in Scottsdale, Houston's has been a family favorite for birthdays, holiday dinners, or just a nice place to grab dinner. The wait staff is extremely polished and doesn't disappoint! 

Notable dishes:
Artichoke Dip: as other Yelp reviewers have attested - this is probably the best artichoke tip I've ever tasted. Chicago style and comes with salsa (if your friends are picky eaters, sell them on that and keep the dip for yourself, chip refills are free.)

Hawaiian Rib Eye: this pineappley marianade is the bomb.

Sushi Menu: unexpectedly good for an American restaurant--the other dishes are worth trying first but the rolls can be great apps for the table."}
{"text":"Great customer service!!! Friendly faces and smiles. You absolutely can't go wrong with the cocktail shrimp, spinach dip, or Hawaiian grilled ribeye steak!!!! Luv it"}
{"text":"My son took me here for my birthday on May 3rd and I was not impressed.  I dare to think i would return. The chicken was very bland and the broccoli was served ice cold. The waiter Kyle was not attentive and always seemed rushed and you had to ask for bread and straws. He appeared irritated when we asked for things...but a good waiter can anticipate and bring items before you ask.  2 stars for bland chicken and poor service."}
{"text":"I wish there was an option to not even give a \"star\". This place just tried to kill my husband. We were just there on date night and were having a wonderful time. After throughly and i mean throughly explaining his allergy of horseradish and any kind of member in the mustard seed family to the waitress, she STILL allowed a side of horseradish to come to the table. After he took a dip of his French fries (thinking it was the ranch he requested) into the deadly condiment he ran to the bathroom and was violently ill. We immediately left and the manager told him to calm down and that if he didn't lower his voice they would call the police. The manager didn't even ask if he was okay or was going to need medical attention. I will never be back since they care more about the volume of your voice and not if you're going to live or not."}
{"text":"So far I have been to this specific Houston's twice and both times I had a great experience as well as a great meal.  The first time I went with a friend of mine.  I had their roasted chicken with couscous and we split the hot fudge sundae.  One of the most flavorful roasted chicken and couscous I have ever had.  And the fudge was rich and decadent.  I had it again the second time I went (yesterday) with my husband.  However, I was a little disappointed with the texture of the ice cream the second time.  It was a little bit on the icy side.  It was still really good though.  

My husband and I also had their Rainbow Roll and their Thai Tuna Roll (sushi).  Also some of the best tasting sushi I have had in the valley, but again I experienced a little bit of a disappointment.  The first roll that came out was the Rainbow Roll, and although it tasted great it was a bit too cold.  Yet, they made up for it with the Thai Tuna Roll -- the perfect temperature.  I also had the Hawaiian Rib Eye (medium rare), my husband had the Prime Rib (medium), and we both had their Cesar Salad.   All of it was very tasty.  The salad was crisp and fresh, with just the right amount of dressing -- thoroughly coating every leaf and not drowning them.  My rib eye was brown and carmalized on the outside and the center was warm and rare without being bloody -- just how a good steak should be. It was marinated in a light terriyaki marinade which gave it great flavor, perhaps a little sweet for my taste buds, but still very good.  I'm more of a savory person.  I can't say anything about the prime rib (I was too busy with my rib eye), but my husband thought his prime rib was very tender, not too fatty, and he thought the horse radish was balanced well so as not to overpower the flavor of the beef.  Our enterees also came with baked potatoes, which were good.  We did not get another side, but I think next time we go I will get a side of their vegetables to cut the richness of everything. We ended with the hot fudge sundae, but next time it will be the peach cobbler.  
The staff was also very great.  They were attentive without being overbearing and their smiles felt genuine.
The atmosphere is cozy due to the smaller size, lively, and comfortable.  No pretensions anywhere.
All in all, a great dinner.  We spent a worthwhile $175 including a bottle of merlot ($36) and 20% tip.  We left stuffed, happy, and a bit buzzed.  LOL."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here I highly recommend it. The service was amazing I could not have asked for a better host. The New Style Seared Tuna Salad was really good, but if your really looking for something to just make your mouth water order the Barbecue Pork Ribs they are to die for. Fall of the bone tender a little tangy, a great bark. There was nothing wrong with those ribs. Homade Sweet & Sour made their margarita's delicious and the perfect pair to cool down their Firehouse Chili. Reservations Highly recommended at least 4 hrs early"}
{"text":"When you first step into Houston's the first thing that comes to mind is..\"Wow this place is pretty cool\" Its very modern and they offer a simple menu. I had there prime rib and it was great. There filet Mignon is also very good as well as there ribs. The other good thing about this place is there friendly waitstaff."}
{"text":"I'm a little biased because I used to work here, but it truly is an outstanding restaurant. Yes,  you may have to wait a while for a table on a weekend - but it's well worth the wait! Consistent excellent food and service, and a fantastic wine selection by the glass. My favorites: Tuna Salad, Veggie Burger (amazing!), smoked salmon appetizer, and tortilla soup. Their spinach dip is also fantastic (try ordering this takeout not cooked, take it to a party, zap it in the microwave - and you'll be a hit!)"}
{"text":"One of my few \"chain\" favs. Restaurants always have great ambience with attentive and very professional staff. The service is always first rate. They also have one of the best veggie burgers. House-made patty, not that Boca Burger!  The Thai Steak salad is very good with a slight amount of spice. When in season, the grilled artichoke is a great starter. Ribs are popular and they always cook their steaks to perfection. Everything they make is very flavorful."}
{"text":"So I was told that this place was in possession of one of the best french dip sandwiches in Phoenix metro area.  Seeing as how I love french dip so much and am always hunting for the best food, we decided to eat here.  

First, I was pretty disappointed in quality to price ratio.   Not only was this thing tiny (like half the meat you get for 10 bucks at a bar) but the fries were pretty tasteless and not cooked well done like I asked.  

I get a better French dip at the local pub for 8 bucks with more meat and better French fries.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"We returned to Houston's after having two bad meals about a year ago.  We were long time fans of this restaurant. 
This evening we decided to give it a try to see if there were any improvements. As usual, the place looked very inviting, the wait person was very friendly and the service was good.

However, self ordered a cheeseburger which arrived cut into 4 quarters, which meant that each section was so small it was impossible to put any dressing on it. Lifting the bun meant the sandwich fell apart! This is about the most inane way we have ever been served a hamburger! 
Not to mention the sloppy mess it left all over my hands. The best thing about it was the laugh that we had about the idiocy of the person who thought of serving a hamburger this way.

The side of French fries was very spare and barely warm. 

Guess we have to think long and hard, most especially very long before we go back to Houston's. We can only recommend it for it's ambiance & the pleasantness of the staff.

Maybe next time they will serve peanut butter and jelly with the crust cut off and sliced into eighths.  Kindergarten style."}
{"text":"Houston's must have changed their recipe for their ribs since we were there. They were horrible. So disappointing."}
{"text":"I LOVE this neighborhood restaurant. The best sushi roll on the menu is the Thai Tuna Roll. It's delicious! My husbands go-to menu choice is the ribs. They are consistently amazing. Do yourself a favor and order the red cabbage and goat cheese as one of your side dishes. This seasonal favorite is available in the winter only. Cheers!"}
{"text":"When I visit my mom in Scottsdale, we usually hit Houstons sometime on my trip.  This time was no exception as we went for lunch last Wednesday.  It's always consistently delicious.  Some of the things we have eaten since dining here for the last 6 years.  Fish Sand...Veg Burger...Veg Plate...Grilled Artichoke App...and this last time I had the Swordfish special.  I can honestly say it's always absolutely yummy.  Yes, the wine has a high mark-up but that's standard issue in the restaurant industry.  If you do have a couple glasses of wine, an app and 2 entress, expect to pay around $90 (factoring in 20% tip)  But when you you spend $90 and walk out with a pleased palate and a happy tummy...it's so worth it.  
Added bonus: The servers here are like a well oiled machine.  Take a moment to watch them constantly glide around the place making sure everything is perfect.  It's kind of like a floor show.  :)"}
{"text":"This is the best houstons location I have ever been to. Every employee there is very nice. Our servers name was Amanda and she was fantastic! I have a food allergy so I'm really specific about making sure there aren't onions in the food I order. She was so helpful about going through what I was thinking about ordering and making sure there weren't onions in anything. She knows that menu like the back of her hand! Super friendly service from the time we walked in to the time we left. I will be requesting her a as a server the next time I come in, which will be very soon. I'm excited to try that dessert she suggested. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This is a go-to spot for lunch or dinner. The most recent time I visited I ordered the French dip. The sandwich was delicious but it was noticeably smaller than usual. Also, the amount of french fries served with the sandwich is laughably small. A $20 sandwich should be served with more fries than you can eat. Please fix this!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here with a friend last night.  We had reservations for 7:30 and like always the place is jam-packed.  I have been here 3 or 4 times previously for dinner and it is always the same.  It is almost impossible to find a decent parking spot or be seated in under 20 minutes.  Well I guess good for them for having such a busy/popular restaurant.  Anyway, as per usual we were seated about 20 minutes late.  About 4 waiters/hosts/etc. came up to us to tell us how truly sorry they were so that was kinda nice.  They even gave us a spinach dip appetizer (my wife's absolute fav) on the house so that more than made up for being seated later than we should have.

I ordered the Caesar salad to start and it was excellent as always.  I LOVE the croutons.  For an entree I had the ribs per my wife's recommendation.  My wife is a huge Houston's fan and has been there dozens more times than I so I trusted her opinion on this.  Anyway, she was correct and they were excellent.  They weren't overly sauced and the meat was fall off the bone tender.  The fries that came with were also very good.  My wife got the halibut and it was just ok.  It was very plain but she enjoyed it so that's what counts.  Our friend had the filet and it looked excellent.  The food there is always pretty solid and you always know what you are going to get.

My only complaint is that because it is so busy, the waiters/waitresses/etc. get a bit overwhelmed and sometimes forget things and take a bit longer than they should.  I guess it isn't their fault but is probably Houston's fault for not hiring more service staff.

All-in-all it was a very good dinner."}
{"text":"Went in there with a family there was 3 toddlers and 2 infants. And the manager came to us and asked us to tell our infants to be quiet. How will you do that???? And they were not noisy at all. Horrible.... please in the future put age limit if you can't handle infants."}
{"text":"Always fantastic if in LA, OC, NY, SF, Denver, Scottsdale, Chicago, or on the square in Kansas City. Food and service is all great. When traveling during many weeks always have to hit once or twice. Wish they would open in Las Vegas. How about the new downtown  Summerlin."}
{"text":"We had such an amazing meal!! Wish there was one in Albuquerque!! The veggieburger  is made on site, and is so big and juicy,you would think you are eating a beef burger! Salads were so fresh..a must do!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was great.  We had the salmon, a burger and the Thai salad.  Everything was excellent, would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Brought my mom here for Mother's Day and we both LOVED every minute of our visit! Impeccable service and friendly atmosphere, Sophisticated yet comfortable. We started off with the shrimp cocktail with two delicious sauces to dip into. 
We both had the rack of ribs  that completely fall off the bone. Tasty, not too sweet and have plenty of meat . Comes with coleslaw and delicious French fries. My mom upgraded to the house salad as a substitute. We had the house made Belgium hot fudge sundae with sugared pecans and highly recommend every bit of this meal. Look forward to a repeat visit to Houston's soon. Thank you Sarah for your excellent care and making this dining experience so exceptional!"}
{"text":"They cut my cheeseburger into quarters. It was cold by the time it arrived at the table. Fries were also cold. When asked, I said that cutting the burger (which I was told is their new \"thing\") made it cold fast, I didn't get a response. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Look. All you need to know is to go on a weekend night and get the Hawaiian ribeye steak. Magic!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was a gem for food for the quickness however. Great service attentive to detail on everything. Open kitchen really adds to the overall ambiance."}
{"text":"I've decided to review all the places I hit while in Scottsdale last week. Per tradition, my mom took me to Houston's the first night I was in town. i've been coming here with my family for 10 years now and it's still as good as it was then. We were greeted and seated immediately. We started with a couple cocktails: martini for me, Manhattan for my mom. Our server was very nice and respectful of our request to catch up over our drinks. 
For old time sake, I had to go for the Chicago-Style Spinach Dip. I do wish they had a better selection of starter. It's between the dip and some smoked salmon thing. Talk about limited ...
For our entrees, we went for salads: Ahi Tuna for me and Thai Noodle for my mom. Both came out perfectly prepared and timed. We also switched to wine with our entree salads. The wine list is nice, high quality selections. Something for everyone. 
I'm not the biggest chain restaurant fan, but Houston's does it right. The food is the same every time - great, fresh."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Houston's last night for dinner.  The hostesses, and our waitress were phenomenal. Not only was the food great and the people but his steak was accidentally thrown away by the bus buy when clearing the table. We wanted the rest wrapped up. Our waitress brought out an entire new 8 oz. rib eye for him to go. Now that is excellent service!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Houston's last night. No wait for a table at 6:30pm. Staff was pleasant and attentive. The food we ordered was great - no complaints. He had their cheeseburger and I had the french dip sandwich. Large portions. I would (will) go back for the french dip!"}
{"text":"Love Houston atmosphere is wonderful. Wait staff are friendly and attentive. Our food was outstanding. Will be back again soon"}
{"text":"Even though we don't frequent this restaurant very often, we really like it and have never been disappointed about our food or the service. We recently took visiting family and they are now huge fans! 
They both ordered the pork chops - well done. Aarrgghh!!! Pork chops well done??? They'll be so dry and leathery But surprise, surprise. Although cooked to their specification, the chops were very moist and super flavorful. One ordered the maple glazed carrots as an accompaniment to the 2 large chops - and he nearly licked his plate clean. One of the standards are the ribs - they are consistently fall-of-the-bone delicious. It's a large order so plan on taking some home. The cole slaw was not as good as I remember, but that's a minor point (apologies to slaw aficionados!) The salmon was perfectly prepared and delicious. For dessert, we had the key lime pie which was not overly sweet, and had a nice balanced lime flavor; and some kind of hot brownie concoction with ice cream...yummmm. When one in our party dripped a little dessert on their shirt, the server was right there with soda water - how many places do that? 
The atmosphere is low lit, up-scale modern steak house type of feel but not cowboy-ish. You can see the cooks working their magic in the kitchen. The only downside comment I would make is we all thought the music was a bit too loud. I understand what the reasoning is behind that, but there were four of us, at a fairly small table, and we had to speak loudly just to carry on a conversation.
All in all, service is super attentive but not overbearing - the servers monitor the guests they are taking care of. And, the food is consistently fabulous."}
{"text":"Why is it always sodark in here? The 60 year old women look like theyre 26....


Anyway, Food and service is always great."}
{"text":"Another fantastic meal at Houston's. First the good. The spinach artichoke dip which is served with chips salsa and sour cream is very good. I ordered the roasted chicken and subbed the fries for the broccoli. The chicken was fantastically prepared and it has a sweet sauce/ gravy that came with it. The broccoli was prepared very well. Cheese butter with a touch of lemon. 

The bad. Spacing, they cram 4 tops in what is designed for two. And they serve soda in bottle form. So you are not getting free refills.  

Seriously get the chicken."}
{"text":"Never fails to be exceptional!  I love the Hawaiian Ribeye... I crave it constantly.  It is the only thing I will really eat."}
{"text":"If you want a nice night out with great service, good flavor, and a fireplace, you can't beat this spot.  Their prime rib and filet were really good.  Perfect sear on the Filet.  Swore I was at Morton's.  Their wine list is also pretty large.  Don't get it twisted, this is not a cheap eats type of place.  I have seen people rating this $$ I think it's definitely more on the $$$ side if you and your date both decide to have entrees and a couple of glasses of vino.   On the other hand, the salads were a deal, I think only $4 with your meal and the baked potato was huge.  If you decide to share an appetizer, and a meal, you may be able to get out of here for under $100.  For me, the total came in around $165 tip included.  The staff here really shines and they and the tasty food are why I'll be a regular here."}
{"text":"First of all the service is top notch. Very professional and always exceeds expectations.
If you have never tried the Hawaiian Rib-eye you have to try it. Do not let the name deter you, it is, hands down the best steak in town. There has never been a let down with any choice on the menu. My personal favorite restaurant in the state along with it's sister location Hillstone."}
{"text":"Definitely call ahead for a reservation.  We were out and decided to eat her since it was near by.  The wait was long for a table but everywhere would have had a wait on a Saturday night.  the food was really good as expected for a steak house of this caliber.  Would I wait again,  probably not. . Would I eat here again,  definitely buy only with a reservation."}
{"text":"Have had the French Dip twice- same result. Not worth the cost. It is good, but the sodium levels will leave you feeling dehydrated for hours."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a bit spoiled having a Hillstone, R&D Kitchen and Bandera all within walking distance. So, when I go to Houston's in another city, I expect it to be as good as home.

This Scottsdale location has some of what I enjoy at Houston's but is missing the sushi and some of the better dished. I was told to try the Hillstone location near the Biltmore, but decided I could pass.

Not bad for a decent salad, and oddly this Houston's is less expensive than my home locations."}
{"text":"Mike Z. and I took a trip over to Houston's last night, the latest stop on my Arizona Tour de Steak.   I'm trying to eat at a new steakhouse every time I come to Scottsdale, and Houston's was the latest stop.  

The first thing that stands out is the service, our waitress was phenomenal and she always checked in with us at exactly the appropriate time.  I tipped accordingly due to the service being so good that it stood out.   

The actual meal was good, it was better than Modern Steak but under Mastro's.   I had the New York strip and I was impressed, it was cooked exactly how I ordered it and had an excellent taste.  No issues with that, or the salad I started out with (classic Steakhouse salad with champagne vinaigrette.)    I also had 2 glasses of wine, both were drinkable but forgettable.   

Overall I had a great experience, and would recommend Houston's if you are looking for a good meal with excellent service."}
{"text":"I used to love Houstons a great deal, however after some menu changes and the constant snootiness of the hosts and wait staff, it's not one of my first choices any more. I'm glad they left the Hawaiian ribeye on the menu as that is quite the succulent cut of cow with a great tenderness that melts in your mouth. However, if you have to wait more than 20 minutes for a seat, I'd go elsewhere. It's just not all that it used to be, and it's sad."}
{"text":"Houston's is a great restaurant when it comes to their food. However, don't come here without reservations or else you will have to deal with the poor attitudes from their hostesses.  We made the mistake of coming without reservations and waited the full one hour and a half to be seated. We contemplated leaving to another restaurant but figured we would wait. We patiently waited for our table as we saw multiple customers being seated. During that time we were able to make observations on the way people were dressed. Most people were dressed for the occasion others were not. For example, flip flops with socks and hoodie, tank tops, and T-shirt's and gym shorts. 

When it was our turn to be seated the hostess then decided to tell me that I would have to remove my hat once in the dining area.  I guess my button down and nice jeans weren't good enough. Next time I should wear flip flops with socks and a hoodie. 

What I don't understand is why the hostess took an hour an half to tell me I couldn't were my hat. Yet, they have a \"dress code\".

Not even Bobby Flays restaurant Gato in NYC is this strict."}
{"text":"The service was sketchy, the food was cold and mediocre. It was difficult to even get a refill of water!  The price was too much for the poor quality of food and service that we experienced. I do NOT recommend Houston's Restaurant when there are so many really good choices in Scottdale."}
{"text":"What else can you say about Houstons- 5 star experience every time! Great wines, we love the ribeye, BBbq ribs, salmon, spinach dip, and if you're in the mood to go big time get the hot fudge sundae! Best service and best meal in town!"}
{"text":"Great food but they should move out the piano that is never used and add another bar or more seating. We are locals who go at least twice a week and the waiting time is ridiculous. Especially when tourist season is here. Many days we just have to walk out and go elsewhere. Also, why is the patio never used?"}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I have eaten at a Houston's. I had always enjoyed it in the past. Tonight was not terrible, it was just a very lack luster meal for $50. I had the blackened ribeye. The only non coated/marinated steak choice was a filet and I'm a strip or ribeye kind of guy. The steak was cooked correctly but even blackened it was very bland. The Tomato blue cheese salad which was the side was the best thing on the plate.
The service from hostess, to server was 200%  my water was alway full and the server was really great. And that's were the 2 stars come from. I would only go back for drinks at the bar with friends or customers."}
{"text":"The absolute best food!  Pricey but worth every penny!  It is the perfect balance of elegance, atmosphere and awesome food.  This is by far our favorite restaurant.  I just wish they would bring back the baked beans!"}
{"text":"Huston's is a staple in town. Always great food and they are very consistent. You know exactly what you are getting every time. This restaurant has more of a corporate feel than most and is not cheap. That said the food is always top quality. Love it and will go back. Totally worth trying if you are in the area or have never been here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Our staple each week, either take out or dining in. No matter what day or city this place is always consistent and always yummy!!! I'm also impressed with their core menu being small. It makes them truly excellent at the items on the menu rather just to be mediocre on everything. Thank you Houston's we always count on you for a wonderful meal. ;)"}
{"text":"A good, consistent menu that has never ceased to satisfy.  It's got the dark, rich steak house atmosphere without the heavy and pretentious menu.  Usual favorites are the ribs, thai steak salad, and the salmon.  The salad in particular is worth a visit.  It is a complex menagerie of several flavors that blend very well.  Among them are mango, avocado, tomato, mint, basil, cilantro, and a superb dressing."}
{"text":"I had not ever been here before but I was with a group and was along for the ride. The atmosphere is attempting to be more fine dining restaurant but it is fine casual, which is fine. The service was very casual and seemed sincere. She was slow to take a drink order but quick to speak when trying to talk about the features. From the time we actually did order food until the time we received our dinner was approx. 25 min. The pork chop my boyfriend got was great, one of our friends ordered the hawaiian flavored steak (ok), the other ordered a thai noodle salad (decent), and I got the salmon.

It was bland and nothing special at all. But then again that was my own fault for trying to get seafood at a steak place.. ha... karma. The potato was large enough for two to share and was drenched in butter and a bit over salted, but cooked nicely. The spinach was more than just aldente and was partially flavorful. What got me though on that was that it was not even cleaned. I am very aware that not every place I go to is going to meet the culinary standards I hold. it was not great but not horrible... It gets a middle of the road review for being a middle of the road chain restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I and her mom went for dinner. The steaks were excellent but the service was very poor.  First our salads were delivered and a minute later the dinners were served so we had to put our salads aside. One of the dinners had mashed potatoes that were cold, barely room temperature. I could not find our waitress so waved down another who took the plate.  The rest of us started to eat slowly to not finish before the other dinner. After 10 minutes we had to stop another waiter and ask for the meal. The manager brought the plate and the potatoes were cold.  We told him but just accepted it and ate it. Soon after we ran out of water and had to stop another waiter to get some water.  The waitress finally showed up and just asked if we wanted dessert, but we took the check. They gave us a credit on the one meal but overall a very poor dining experience."}
{"text":"First off, I am a huge fan of Hillstone restaurants in general. I have eaten at Hillstone in San Francisco, R&D in Yountville and Rutherford Grill in Rutherford, CA (hands down, my favorite) I was equally impressed by the ambiance and the food was, as expected, fabulous.  I ordered the spinach dip as a starter and the Prime Rib French Dip for my main entree.  I found it refreshing that they had different (to me) sides compared to the California offerings. I ordered the Emerald Kale Salad, absolutely THE BEST!  I highly recommend it! I will be attempting to recreate this one for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Amazing service. 
My party had the Loup De Mer, salmon dish, ribs, and prime rib. All of it was amazing and splendidly dished. 
Make this a night out if you're in Scottsdale! Also frequented by baseball athletes during March, which is a plus if you're a baseball fan.
Cheers!"}
{"text":"Houston's was great- this was my first time eating at one even though I have a Houston's in San Francisco- I got the French dip and it did not disappoint. I recommend getting the spicy mayo as well. Would recommend for a good dining experience in Scottsdale, I sat at the bar and got great service but it's a busy place so be sure to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Met a good friend and family here while I was in town on business.  We all enjoyed our food and the service was great.  The bar was fun while waiting and they have a nice selection of brews."}
{"text":"Houston's is evidence that it is better to do a few things really (really, really) well than to do many things in mediocrity. 

I had the prime rib French dip and I thought it was amazing until I had a bite of my boyfriend's pork chop and baked potato and my friend's seared ahi. It's all so so good and completely worth the money. 

Nice ambiance, and the restaurant is large is keep things (people) moving. We sat in 10 minutes, which sounds like many others who have reviewed herein."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. I got the flying chicken platter and my wife got the hickory burger. Mine was pretty BALLER! The way they fried the chicken strip was so good. Light and crispy almost the way calamari is fried. The slaw that came with it was refreshing  (look at me with my descriptive words) and not too dressing type. My wife's burger, in my opinion, left me wanting and needing water due to being a little on the dry end for me. She liked it, I didn't what else is new in marriage. Anyhow, I'd recommend coming here for a good meal that is served in a very timely manner."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this restaurant, but after some recent experiences, I plan to take my business elsewhere.

Their service remains excellent, but food quality has seriously soured.  I ordered the Chinese Chicken salad (chicken on the side since I am vegetarian), which they accommodated.  My mom and I split this along with a side of french fries.  The salad used to be so big I could eat and eat and eat and not make a dent.  We devoured this one quickly.  The carrots are in chunks instead of shredded and there are too many tortilla strips.  The greens are even lighter in color and less crunchy.  My mom enjoyed the chicken and the amount they provided.

The fries were disappointing.  They have changed the potatoes so they are much chunkier (not the shoestring yumminess it used to be) and the flavor is more comparable to fast food than to anything worth of a seated restaurant.  I didn't even eat them and decided to fill up at home instead.  Our server did take the fries off the bill after we mentioned how different they were.  We were told that they were changed for quality, but I am positive it must be a cost issue.

I would go to the bar for a glass of wine as I still like the ambiance and service, but the food is not up to par anymore.  I have other restaurants that are tastier."}
{"text":"My go to for a Hawaiian Ribeye.  Can go wrong with the spinach dip.   Artichoke hearts are to die for."}
{"text":"Just had my second visit to this terrific restaurant along with my wife, another couple and their kids.  Our server was extremely accommodating and attentive.  My only gripe if you can call it that is they ran out of prime rib by the time we arrived which was not that late . . . near 8 pm.  I opted for their NY strip which was very tasty but a tad overdone for medium rare.  Overall though, this was favorable follow up visit which we all enjoyed immensely."}
{"text":"Staff has great knowledge of gluten free options and there r many. We made reservations which are more like a \"call ahead\" rather than being seated at that time. Food was good but not as good as we remembered. Probably not quite worth price"}
{"text":"Great vibe, good atmosphere, and the furnishings remind you  of the steak house you always loved in whatever state you traveled too 

For sure a Scottsdale hot spot. Just a couple of miles north of
Old Town. Great menu and delicious food. $$$ Plan on spending a little when your here.  

The bar rocks and the bartenders are well groomed and friendly. Staff as a whole are pretty awesome... located around several other great venues. So, when your done, walk off that dinner and grab a nearby coffee or ice cream. Many eclectic shops in the footprint too.

{"text":"Not like the other Houston's in the Hillstone restaurant group.  Went here expecting the same great service and menu as the other locations but instead experienced a rude and unaccommodating staff.  I asked for a non-sugar based martini muddled with cucumbers and even though they had cucumbers in the kitchen they would not use them to make a drink!  The manager explained they allow no substitutions or deviations from their menu - whether food or drink.  We ended up leaving... Love Houston's but not this location under current management."}
{"text":"I waited a very very long time with my 2 year old and my grandmother who was in town and then my crunchy French toast was completely the opposite is was soggy American cereal... Like seriously, mashed up captain crunch I think on wet bread it was really bad but the manager was nice took like 6 bucks off cause we waited two hours and my grandma said that her green chili thing was good or I would have given it a fat ZERO"}
{"text":"Houston's delivers a solid meal every time and that spinach dip goes straight to my hips every time as well! 

Yes, there will most likely always be a wait at Houston's unless you get in right before the lunch or dinner crowd...but mind you, there are some early birds in the bunch. Regardless, the wait is ok because they keep a fire going to cozy up the wait time and then there's always the bar to warm you up from the inside out. 

The seats at Houston's are nice because they are private so you can have a conversation without feeling like four other tables have stopped their conversation to listen in on yours. The service is normally pretty quick and then there's the food. Like I said, Houston's delvers a solid and hearty meal. The spinach dip is a must on the list of starters regardless of the calories that come with it. I've enjoyed the chopped salad with a side of honey mustard. Their honey mustard is creamy and delicious and one of my favorite honey mustard locations. I do miss the Racket club. They used to do it perfectly with some relish and honey mustard on soft bread. RIP Racket Club. However, the normal club is good too and you can never go wrong with the Biltmore Chicken Sandwich and their ribs are famous too. For dessert, my personal favorite is the Apple cobbler but apparently it's seasonal and so they will switch it out for the Key Lime Pie. It's always a hit or miss on whether or not they will have the Apple Cobbler and personally, I think they need to keep the cobbler on the menu year-round because it would keep some regular customers coming in over and over -- like me! 

I've been visiting Houston's for years. It's also cozy once inside and the fire"}
{"text":"Delicious.

Sort of romantic. (Because of the low lighting.) But I was having a night with the fellas.

An exquisite dining experience. Service was on point. I was feeling the vibe of the place... even when walking inside the restaurant. The mirrors outside of the restrooms helped remind me of my sexiess...

*silliness

The food. Wow, my prime rib was magnificent. It was as tasty as it looked and every bite brought me to a happy place.

I really kinda wanna go back and enjoy this place again."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  We were not made to feel welcome in any way.  Asked to sit on the patio, but were told we would not be served.  Had to go to the bar and pick up our own drinks and if felt like the staff did not give a crap.  So we left and went up the street to Fleming's, it was wonderful.  Houston's - Never Again !"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Houston restaurants in other cities in the past with good experiences many years ago and jumped at the chance to try this venerable institution again.  My co-worker and I got seated at a comfortable booth although I noted that the background music seemed a bit too loud and asked if they could turn it down.  The staff said that they would although I did not notice a real profound difference.

We started out with the smoked salmon which was really good.  They gave us a good chunk of fish which had a nice smoky flavor.  

I then chose the French dip sandwich which was very good as well.  There was a good amount of meat which was nice and juicy and just tasty. The accompanying fries were good, although slightly overseasoned for my taste.

Service was good - there were lots of staff available around who would unobtrusively ensure that my water glass was filled.  It was a little pricey at around $35 per person for lunch, but at least there is consistently good food and service."}
{"text":"Yummy food and good service! Came for lunch, was seated right away, and served our drinks shortly after. Our server was Whitney S.  She was very accommodating throughout the whole lunch and especially when trying to find my aunt a sweet wine. My aunt doesn't know slot about wines so she had to taste a few before we found the right match. :-) I ordered the the club salad with buttermilk garlic dressing on the side.  The chicken was on the bottom of the salad. Different presentation, but I liked it. This was my first time dining here. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Why I hate Houston's... sounds like a fun start to not so glowing review, huh? This one will be short and sweet.. 

Since when can you not wear a baseball cap into a chain restaurant? Seriously.. this place is like TGI Fridays without the kitschy crap on the walls. Apparently they have a \"Appropriate Attire Required\" sign on the door. Its in the smallest letters at the foot of the door so I had no idea that my cap was inappropriate.. fucking come on? Its not some swank restaurant at an even swankier resort or hotel.. its a dated chain restaurant, where families come to stuff their faces with well priced food. Now for a chain its much nicer than some but still a chain. Their house rule of trying to be something theyre not is pretty stupid. 

Though kudos to the manager for not kicking us out as there of course was a confrontation. I love confrontations.. she had no reasonable explanation for the rule except that it was their rule. While I will never go back to Houston's again because of their idiotic rule I will say the food and service was acceptable."}
{"text":"So tonight we have Big dinner here (again). It's my second time to been this restaurant. I'm really love service here and also The foods so nice. My favorite dish it's Barbecue Pork Ribs ,Pork Filet and more in menu. If you want wonderful dinner with Family or someone special this is a good choice for you I confirm. Enjoy

I'm lucky last year I'm here same day too and now we have a same table."}
{"text":"Love the decor, very nice. We were there on a Tuesday night and by the time we left there was a very good crowd. 

We started out with the spinach artichoke dip. It was excellent. I was not crazy about the rosemary focaccia, it was a little too white bread for me. 

I had the Thai Steak salad, which was really good, with a nice little kick to it. My friend had the fish sandwich - the breading was amazing, I did not taste the fish l. A third in our party had the burger, which was also very good, including the house made roll. 

We followed up with coffee and cheesecake. The coffee was strong (decaf) and the cheesecake was decadent but had too much lemon flavor for me."}
{"text":"Loved our evening here! Wish we had discovered it sooner but we will be back on our next trip to Scottsdale for sure!! Big enough restaurant but a very cozy atmosphere"}
{"text":"Always delicious with outstanding service, Houston's never disappoints!  Classic decor and classic American menu make this place a hit.  I have been to Houston's in Scottsdale many times over the 20 years that I've lived in Phoenix and I have never had a bad meal.  The wait staff is always professional and courteous.  The Baked Potato Soup is to die for.  Their Spinach Dip is also a crowd pleaser.  My favorite is the Ahi Tuna Steak."}
{"text":"The roast beef/prime rib dip is the way to go. I don't think that they get any better than this."}
{"text":"Generous portions and service is good. We usually eat early to avoid the crowds but still made reservations due to our large family. There are a lot of good choices on the menu and several that I need to try based on yelp reviews/photos so I don't think anything you order will be bad. Definitely recommend getting reservations because even on a weeknight, every table was occupied including a two seater that had four people around it."}
{"text":"FABULOUS!!!!

We were here for spring break last week, and one of hubby's friends said we must eat at Houston's. Glad he told us to go here (and he also told us about \"The Breakfast Club\" - another WIN!). 

We got there pretty early on a weeknight - 6:15ish (?) - and there was already a LONG wait.  Many retired folks go here I think... so they probably start arriving at about 5? Note to self, go earlier next time if with kids.  We got the kids shirley temples and an appetizer, and waited for maybe 30 minutes for our table.  Got to do some fabulous people watching while we waited! I could have SWORN they must have the \"HOUSEWIVES OF SCOTTSDALE\" there that night (if there were such a thing). We were standing right next to 3 of them, I say jokingly.  They were of course very nice and charming... but I had to laugh to myself that they could film that show here.

Got seated - and the food was fabulous! I had the ahi tuna salad (was torn between that or the thai noodle salad, but daughter voted for this one and I think I was going to share some with her, is why I must have let her help me decide this time?). Amazing. Ate it all.  Hubby got their hickory burger and chowed down. Kids liked whatever they got too. 

So glad we went here and waited to get a table when we were all famished after a long day of watching some major league baseball. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Decided to check our Houston's recently on my family vacay to Scottsdale and overall it was a pretty decent experience.

We stopped by for lunch and the place was totally dead. We were seated immediately but our server seemed pretty indifferent to our presence. We didn't see our server after he dropped off our food and had waive down a busser for refills and the check. Maybe it was because we were younger than the average patron, but service was a bit of a let down. The restaurant is nice and spacious, and definitely fits the upscale atmosphere of Scottsdale. 


My cousins ordered the Hickory Burger which came with a mound of shredded cheddar cheese and thick slices of Canadian bacon. While it sounds good, the cheese was too much and the bacon slices added a rubbery texture to the burger. 
I had the Biltmore Chicken Sandwich which was pretty decent. I could see why the kitchen skewered it twice with toothpicks as the sandwich falls apart pretty quick. Despite it's structural problems, the sandwich was delicious and probably one of the better offerings on the lunch menu. I was disappointed that the soft drinks were 'by the bottle' and not refillable. At $3 for a  8oz bottle, you could easily spend the price of your entree on soda. 

Overall I wouldn't mind returning for dinner but Houstons wouldn't be at the top my list for dining"}
{"text":"A changed experience - but not for the better! We have been devoted Houston's customers for nearly 20 years but recently have noticed a marked deterioration in the food quality, ordering flexibility and wait staff attitudes.  The Scottish salmon used to be grilled; now overseasoned and pan seared - not the same fine taste.  The cheeseburger used to be the \"Cadillac standard\" but no more - it seems much smaller, while buried in shredded lettuce and a bun covered in a hickory sauce - I just want a quality burger without sauces - put it on the side!  The kale salad should be good, but even the manager was inflexible about substituting for the peanut dressing - some in our party are allergic to peanuts - and they have a great Caesar dressing.  And a really good Caesar salad, why is it not on the menu? You have to know to ask for it.  The staff used to be exceptional but now seem indifferent.  While Houston's entrees are expensive, the great quality and staff always made it worth it, but as things have gone down hill, we are not in a hurry to return - there are so many better places to dine in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The best ceasar salad I've had in a long time.  Ribeye and swordfish were excellent.  Service was first class."}
{"text":"The initial impression of Houstons for me was \"Rich people welcomed\". The drink menu for Houstons was a little excessive, and the food menu lacking. There isn't much to choose from. The servers aren't exactly the best. I feel like if there wasn't an 18% forced gratuity for parties of 5 or more, the servers wpuld be a little more hospitable. Overall the food was average. The Hickory burger comes with a ridiculous amount of cheese. The Canadian bacon tasted very slimey and overcooked. The Smoked Hiclory Salmon was mostly a plate of white bread. The salmon was cold and undesirable. The Biltmore Chicken Sandwich was one of the only good dishes. Overall my experience here was not the best. The selection was poor and I wouldn't like to come here again unless the menu was expanded."}
{"text":"Houston's was a long-time favorite but recent changes have pushed us away. It's a shame, too, because there's a lot to like about this place. They have one of the top 5 cheeseburgers in the Valley. The grilled artichokes are a great starter. The ribs are reliably tasty and tender. They have great specials. And my wife loves the prime rib sandwich. 

But here's the problem.... First of all, I loved their fresh fish sandwich - which used to be a rotating selection, grilled to perfection. Now they just have a standard fried fish sandwich - no variety - and that stinks. 

And this used to be a family-friendly restaurant, where we'd go with the kids and Grandpa and Grandma for an early dinner (5PM-ish) on Saturday's or Sunday's. They had a great grilled cheese and offered a free dish of ice cream afterwards. But not anymore. In fact, the last time we went - it was our 5YO daughter who requested Houston's only to find out they weren't offering her favorite grilled cheese when we tried to order. She was bummed!

We've found ourselves going to other places instead. Chelsea Grill. Arcadia Tavern. Indulge Burger. Etc."}
{"text":"During my college days, I did my fair share of serving and bartending, and let me tell you- you will not find better service anywhere! Service can be a tad stuffy if you are someone who likes to chat up your servers, but man are they on point!

I come here every on a monthly basis, that's how much i L.O.V.E. this place. It is great for a date or special occasion, or when you just want a yummy in your tummy dinner. However, it is not good for groups... I don't believe you can get a table for more than 5 people.

Their menu is very broad from salads and sandwiches to ribs and sushi. I have always loved their French dip... opt for the baked potato instead of fries. Recently I gave up eating meat FOR A WHOLE YEAR (thank you, it was a feat), and their veggie burger was the best I've had anywhere. I still order it from time to time, even now eating meat again. Again, opt for the baked potato. If you like potatoes, just play it right and ALWAYS opt for the baked potato! 

Great wine selection, something for every palate and decent price points. The ambiance is perfect and definitely save room for dessert. They have an AMAZING key lime pie and pant button popping hot fudge sundae.

Definitely try to make a reservation if you are going in on the weekend. Sitting at the bar is also nice and a little more casual.

Parking is super easy... and guys, leave your hat at home!"}
{"text":"Love Houstons! But the burger experience isn't the same, still so bummed they've changed their shoe string fries to regular old, unflavored fries. BRING back the SHOESTRINGS!"}
{"text":"Houston's gets everything right, every time.

The dreamy dark wood interior, the sumptuous seating, the oversized portions of flavor filled food! I relished the amazing wedge salad with thick chunks of blue cheeses and half a hog of  bacon.

My wife enjoyed a filet that was perfectly prepared and smoky. My ribs were the ultimate fall of the bone wet style wonder made of dreams... Even their unique Cole slaw is a taste bud shaker.

For desert, the American mind blower: key lime pie, that gently cradled my soul as if I was resting in the loving arms of a giant Jesus.

Don't miss this place and prepare for a wait,never with reservations."}
{"text":"can't beat the tempura chicken strips. the prime rib dip with au jus is tough to top. you just can't really go wrong at any houston's. just one thing - FOR GOD'S SAKE - DO NOT order a bloody mary because they have no FUCKING IDEA how to make one. that is the only qualm i have with THIS houston's. any one in atlanta, dallas, new orleans - any place in the south - knows how to make a bloody mary. someone needs to let this houston's know that the first ingredient is ICE! c'mon, houston's!"}
{"text":"If your ever in town or live here this is the place to go!!! I recently had an AMAZING experience that blew me away and I just had to write this review.  The service is always OUTSTANDING first of all. All the staff is friendly and has great customer service. When we were there I wanted the Fish Sandwich. The server ordered that but then later came back  and said they ran out. I was very disappointed it was Friday and still early. I ordered my 2nd choice but didn't like it. We told the server what happened and without question the manager Angela came over to our table and apologized. She let me order something different and took other dinner off the menu. We were very satisfied  with the service! We came back again  and the manager Angela remembered us. We didn't order the Fish sandwich! But when we got our food  the manager brought it out as a SURPRISE with our dinner! This was INCREDIBLE not only did she take care of us the first time, but she made it even better if the 2nd time! I work in customer service and I don't often get to praise wonderful people who do such a magnificent job.PLEASE go here you WONT be Disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"The 3rd time really is the charm. It's now one of my favorites. The service with everyone helping each other does work well.
Food: smoked Salmon, Grilled Artichokes, and the fresh jumbo Shrimp Cocktails are winners. Mains like Roteserie Chicken, prime Rib,or the burgers and Entree Salads are terrific. And don't forget the. HF Sundae."}
{"text":"Mmmm, Mmmm Good.  This place is ALWAYS satisfying.  I just had an early dinner there and had forgotten how much i loved this place since i hadn't been in a few months.  
My absolute favorite meal there from start to finish is to start with the spinach dip, have the Hawaiian Rib-Eye for my entre and their Chocolate Brownie for desert w Coffee...DELICIOUS!  
However, today i tried the Veggie burger out of Curiosity and it was a pleasant surprise to have that much flavor in a Veggie Burger.  It was even so filling that i had to take half home with me which i was not expecting at all.  My dad had the swordfish and my brother had the steak salad and both were wonderful.  
I have never tried anything here that i didn't like. But i will say that i wouldn't recommend that you order their Sushi-not because it's not good but because it's not their specialty and i would much rather recommend a Sushi restaurant.  Besides that-the service is outstanding and the ambiance is perfect for a lunch or dinner full of conversation.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Right near work, love this place!!  So many fantastic menu items.  Love the vibe, love absolutely everything about Houstons!!"}
{"text":"I just brought a friend here for his first dining experience at Houstons.  I suggested the Hawaiian ribeye, which if you're a carnivore, is one of the most unique and best steaks you'll ever have.  I was so confident that he'd love that he mirrored my order.  Well when Presley, our wonderful waitress, concurred, we awaited our treat.  My mouth started watering as soon as I saw it.  As soon as my buddy took his first bite, he fell in love.  Needless to say nothing was left over.  Presley suggested a cab \"mi sue no\"...fantastic!  I will return and ask for Presley!  She's a dear."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants of all time. Everything in the place is outstanding and well above anyone's expectations. The burgers are the best I have ever had, in fact I have a hard time ordering a hamburger anywhere else but Houston's. My personal favorite is the Hickory Burger which comes with Canadian bacon, shredded cheddar cheese, and a special hickory sauce on top. The ribs are also an excellent selection. The meat literally falls off the bone with these.

I must say that I am a \"regular' for Saturday lunches but I get there right when it opens at 11 so my group and I are guaranteed our bar top table. The only bad thing about this place is that it is always busy unless you go at off times. However, to accommodate the wait, they have a beautiful outside patio that serves drinks and appetizers while you wait (I would recommend the spinach dip while you wait...you might be sad when your table arrives and there's still a little dip left)."}
{"text":"Always consistently good.  This last visit I had the Thai steak and noodle salad.  I think it's my new favorite!"}
{"text":"I will keep it short and sweet. I ordered the Hawaiian Ribeye. It was cooked as requested, however, for $36 it was a little fatty and charred. The service was incredibly friendly, but slow at times. It was an overall pleasant experience, but not perfect. My advice: give it a shot, but be very specific about how you like your steak."}
{"text":"The Best French Dip I've Ever had.  Fresh cut, small fries.  Fresh squeezed juices in bar.  Perfect for lunch and HH.  Great place for yummy beef dinner"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times but never wrote a review.  Always LOVE the food.  Tonight I came in for my boyfriend and I's anniversary.  I always forget to make a reservation ahead of time so the wait is normally long but it makes sense why and it's well worth the wait!  I recommend the flying chicken because it's super crispy yet light and the French dip is really juicy, great quality meat.  My boyfriend got the Hawaiian ribeye and was in heaven.  Will come here again always always!  I'm writing this as I was waiting for our brownie dessert to get to the table but I'm assuming it will be delicious too."}
{"text":"OK, I decided to try Houson's again. I am a local and used to love this place. So, after a 14 hour work day I decided to take dinner home at 9PM, Thursday night. I called in an order. Got to the restaurant and they could not find my order. After 20 minutes, they find it, no apology, then they prepared my order. Ribs were over cooked, some of them were black and over cooked, coleslaw was good, Spinach artichoke dip was ice cold when I got home, had not even been heated. Fries were greasy. What happened to this once great place. Now, this small order was $50 and horrible. They will stay in business because the snowbirds will frequent it but locals, beware."}
{"text":"Seriously love this place! keeps getting better! Service is phenomenal, i have been going to Houstons with my family ever since I was younger it was always our special treat, I can never get sick of this place!"}
{"text":"Houstons has the best service I have seen anywhere, at any restaurant. That alone is worth going for. If you go around 4:30 on the weekends, there is no wait.
The sushi combo plate is fantastic. Best sushi I have ever had in my life. Really.
That's just the appetizer. THEN I order the grilled seasonal fish and veggies, always good. Ask them to go light on the butter and oil. And get a side of string fries. They are amazing!
Also great is the Grilled Chicken Salad...put the fries IN the salad. You will LOVE it! The chicken is like butter.
And my hubby always gets the cheese toast although it is not on the menu and the filet (always perfect) and baked beans. 
My only complain is they don't have a happy hour. They are too good for that I guess. That's a bummer.
Service here is like none other though. The best!"}
{"text":"Go to Houston's if you want consistently delicious food and great service. I have tried a lot of items on the menu and I have never been disappointed. Some of my favorites are the smoked salmon appetizer, hickory burger, French dip, emerald kale salad, veggie burger, and the hot fudge sundae (duh)! There's a reason why this place always has a wait - but it's always worth it."}
{"text":"Consistently good. Both the food and service is high quality. The staff is also very friendly. My standard go to's are the tuna salad, veggie burger and French dip. My 4 stars instead of 5 is for value. I think it's overpriced."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for ribs. Usually, the service is fantastic. Last night the service was less than good. I do not expect to have to ask for my drink or a refill numerous times. Even a request for a lime was dismissed. When I ask for a baked potato with the \"fixens\" on the side, it should be on the side. At 6 pm my server should be ready to serve. I was so disappointed as I had taken guests from out of town and raved about the food and service. It was embarrassing."}
{"text":"Just had a fabulous evening here, great to go on a date night;) very attentive service even the manager Dimitri stopped by our table to see how everything was, we had the roast beef sandwich was so tender and flavorful, also had the rotisserie chicken and it was perfect, you must finish up with the sundae with hot Belgian chocolate to die for!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with business guest. Great service, excellent food and nice ambience. Spinach & artichoke dip, Hawaiian Ribeye and Roasted Prime Rib were excellent."}
{"text":"Was just discriminated against and made uncomfortable to the point of leaving for being \"out of dress-code\" when other patrons in the restaurant were in similar attire. Never thought I'd be so disappointed in the management of this establishment. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The fact this restaurant has 4 stars boggles my mind. The service and atmosphere is great but the food, unfortunately was a let down. 

We were recommended this place by a friend because of how much my bf loves french dips. We figured for $19 and the rave reviews it would be a great sandwich. If you love bread, not a lot of meat and sub par au jus, then this would be the sandwich for you. I've had plenty of better french dips at local bars, for half the price. We also requested extra crispy french fries, which came out pretty soggy.

I ordered the thai steak salad. I LOVE thai everything, but this salad was just a smorgasbord  of clashing flavors. The filet in my salad was also very salty. Not a very well thought out dish, was only able to eat half of it. 

All in all, not worth the price. Disappointing.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Always terrific service! Great food and staff.
Try the French Dip you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Houston's came through again last night, and we just beat the crowd!  Jared and I arrived around 6pm and found 2 seats at the bar (he loves sitting at the bar).  We just beat the rush!

Rainy, the bartender, was super friendly, and awesome at helping everyone with the perfect wine.  I noticed several menu changes since my last visit including their newest addition - sushi!  We decided to split the fresh seasonal veggie plate and the tuna salad (which is now served with the tuna in a sushi roll).  Still the same salad - and although we both like it sashimi style like they used to do, the roll was yummy, fresh, and great quality - like everything on Houston's menu.

We made conversation with those around us as we enjoyed every last bite of our meals.  Thanks again Houston's for being such a consistently delicious, warm, and welcoming dining option!"}
{"text":"It's not that the food is spectacular; it's only very good as a matter of fact. Houston's gets five stars because they consistently produce very good food along with impeccable service and a cool dark ambiance featuring great 60s' jazz in the background."}
{"text":"This is our home base for restaurants.  Always amazing service by Erin, Bryn and Luke in the bar.  It's a great place for two to grab dinner in the bar or for a group to eat at the community table or you can sit in the dining room which is very comfortable.  The best way to start out your experience is with a grilled artichoke.  I don't know how they do it but the flavor is like no other.  The filet is one of the best in town and if you want an amazing French dip sandwich, you must try it here.  The fries are freshly cut and made and are out of this world.  The Thai steak salad with mango is one of the best if you want something lighter.  For dessert, the only option you must choose is the hot fudge Sunday.  The hot fudge is served on the side and you can pour as much as you would like on top of the ice cream.  I suggest going heavy with the fudge!"}
{"text":"The night was perfect all around thanks primarily to the Houston's staff and great meals served in a very cozy atmosphere with family that have not seen for years. Six star performance from all Houston staff. Thank you."}
{"text":"Having been Scottsdale residents for many years, we still drive 35 miles from Anthem to Scottsdale to eat out.  My son had to wait over half an hour for his drink,  and when I asked her what their lowest calorie/fat salad might be she shrugged her shoulders.  I made the mistake of ordering the one she suggested.  Big mistake.  It was loaded with tortilla stips, dripping in what tasted like rancid peanut oil... She didn't even notice I only took about 5 bites of the salad, after pushing all the tortilla strips to the side.  I'm seriously trying to lose weight, and only ate a few bites of the salad.  I left hungry and very cranky.  My husband and grow up sons loved their burger and pork ribs.  I don't think I'll be back again."}
{"text":"VISITORS..... LOCALS... BE AWARE!!! SO MANY BETTER OPTIONS IN SCOTTSDALE! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY! 

I must say.... It truly disappoints me to write this review. I contemplating composing a novel based off my recent HORRIBLE  experience but I will keep it short. Here we go, #1 I have dinned at this restaurant NUMEROUS times and one thing I liked about Houstons is that it has always been pretty consistent (until recently). I have a home right across the street so its a place I frequent often. However the last couple visits of mine  I have noticed this place has been slipping (food quality, service, cleanliness etc.) My latest visit will definitely be my last. I sent my cold, not cooked chicken entree back twice and management handled the entire situation poorly. I am not that crazy customer looking for a free meal. I understand not everything can come out perfectly every time. However something I do expect to be handled properly each time is customer service and management failed miserably yet again. Mistakes happen I get that but this management team needs to treat their customers with respect regardless of race, demographic and how many bottles of wines they have ordered. Please do your research when looking for your next night out on the town in Scottsdale you can do much better!"}
{"text":"We started coming to Houston's' on Scottsdale Road in 2004 our first trip to the Valley of the Sun! Fabulous atmosphere with the Scottsdale \"buzz\" of locals and tourists alike. Beautiful room with intimate booths and tables, cool jazz playing in the background and the best barbecue baby back ribs of any where I have tried from Arizona to Texas! Try the Thai Steak and Noodle Salad and the Chicago Style Spinach Dip! Service is always excellent and this place is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"I have been dining at this location since it opened.  Tonight, I just wanted a light snack in one of my favorite places.  Imagine when I walked in and discovered that one of my favorite bartenders was back! Yahoo!  She immediately greeted me, served me a glass of wine, introduced ,e to \"Regan\"  and returned to her duties at the other end of the bar.  The other bartender \"Regan\" took over,    :(

I had to ask for a glass of water.  Then I had to ask for the Spinach dip.  I never received silverware or a napkin.  I was never asked if I would like another glass of wine (it would have been nice and an additional $15 sale) then... had to ask for my check just so I coul leave legally.   0 service.... 0 customer satisaction.  

So, so sad"}
{"text":"I have always liked Houston's (even when it was on Camelback and 24th St.).  We came here on a Saturday night, hoping the wait was not too long.  It was about 20 mins, but a lot of folks waiting in the front area.  The servers are always top notch.  They know the menu well especially if you are dining with someone with allergies.

SPINACH & ARTICHOKE DIP -  \"Chicago-style\" with salsa and sour cream:  It is so good.  MUST order for an appetizer.  

HAWAIIAN RIB-EYE - Pineapple sesame ginger marinade, grilled over hardwood, & loaded baked potato: The marinade for the rib-eye is so flavorful and make light crispy rust on the rib-eye.  The loaded baked potato is great with everything on it!"}
{"text":"Houston's is a great sleeper steakhouse. You can usually get a table if you go close to opening time. The service is friendly and the food is always good. This visit we had the grilled artichokes and they were exceptional. I was lucky to find the recipe on Pinterest so we could have them at home."}
{"text":"One great thing about Houston's: CONSISTENCY! Every time I go it is great. I have never left feeling unsatisfied or pissed because I spent money on food that was terrible. I am sure this is one of the reasons why Houston's has been around for a long time. 

For starters go with the Spinach Dip. Best I have ever had! They give you sour cream and salsa to mix it up a bit, but I am a purest and stick with just the chips and the dip. They have a somewhat limited selection of beers, but offer the main stays of domestic lights. They also have a beer I have grown to love, Sessions. It's an American lager, similar to Stella in taste. It comes in what looks like a Red Stripe bottle. 

The service at this location has always been great. They are very attentive and are always there to fill up your water or see if you need another drink. There can be a wait here so make reservations or be prepared to wait. There is a bar to wait and grab a drink beforehand, which always makes the time go by faster. 

Normally I get the Ahi Tuna entree, when they have it. It comes seared, so rare, but I look mine a little more well done and the staff is always accommodating. The seasonal vegetables that are served with most of the entrees are fresh and either steamed or sauteed perfectly, plus they put a little bit of Parmesan cheese on top. Good touch. I have had the cheeseburger also. It has slowly grown on me. I didn't like it at first, but it is tasty. The fries are great too. I have also had the dirty rice and beans on the side. Black beans and white rice. Nice compliment if you are having a small salad or something. 

Can't say that I have had dessert. I think most of their choices have nuts in them. I despise nuts."}
{"text":"I should have written this review years ago.  The food and service at this restaurant is consistently excellent.  I would say I eat here on average, twice a month for approximately 15 years, maybe longer.  We always try new restaurants and try to spread around our $$$ especially during hard economic times. But Houston's always end up on the top of the list.  I can't tell you how many times in Scottsdale that I have paid $200 - $ 400 for a dining experience that was insulting. Especially the Hotels anymore; Lon's at the Hermosa, Rita's and BLT at the Camelback Inn. Poorly executed, stale, uninspired food.  To say that the service is bad gives them credit they don't deserve.  Strictly armature all the way around.  Then I come here and am blown away.  I end up regretting wasting my time and money at so many other restaurants around town.
I just wish they had a nicer patio; there would be no reason to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years and it always is consistently good! Wanted to take a picture and I had to dig into the ribs which are their specialty, but already started on them so you'll mainly get to see the bones! Finger lickin good!! Hopefully I'll have enough room in my tummy for their fabulous homemade key lime pie!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for the past few years and it's been consistantly great.  The food is excellent, the servers are kind and seem to be smiling all the time, and the ambience never fails!

Prime rib is my fave dish here.  I order the end cut because I like my meat to be cooked well done and to the point where it literally falls off the bone.  Houston's prime rib doesn't fail.  It's usually a huge portion and is nicely marbled and seasoned just right.  Paired with the au jus and horseradish, it's my favorite prime rib in the valley.  yummy!

My husband's must-gets are the smoked salmon and the chicken caesar salad.  They are BOTH delicious.  The smokiness of the salmon, the crisp toast, and the tarter sauce make it one of the best appetizer dishes around.  Lastly, about the caesar salad:  it's got the perfect dressing.  It's creamy, cheesy, and has a really nice garlicy kick to it.  

The servers & hosts are great in this location.  It seems they're always very gracious and are smiling.  It makes dinner that much better."}
{"text":"I have eaten in a few different Houston's and this one is my favorite! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My hubby had a a martini.  The server came back twice to give him a fresh frozen martini glass.  The food is fresh and well prepared. The prices are fair. The parking good. The staff well trained."}
{"text":"This place is consistently good. 

I have had the salmon both times. 

The wait staff is also excellent!"}
{"text":"It's always fun getting kicked out of a restaurant that you eat at once a week because of what you're wearing. My husband and I were addressed (after we were seated and already had drinks) and told that he was not allowed to wear a sleeveless shirt (I also had a sleeveless shirt on and a lady at the table next to us had a swimsuit coverup on with swimsuit visible). 

The waitress, or hostess, not sure which role she was playing - had an XL black t-shirt in her hand and let us know this information and told my husband he could \"put it on\" or... what, leave? It was embarrassing to say the LEAST being in the middle of the restaurant cut off mid-sip of water and told this. Are you kidding me?

This place was a staple for us. We have always raved about the Hillstone restaurants and visit them every place we travel. Even thought this location is mediocre and the service is very poor, we go back for the food.

I don't think any sleeveless shirt could ever be tackier than what we witnessed today. 

And it's 2016, if a lady can wear a visible swimsuit in your restaurant my husband should be able to wear a sleeveless shirt in 109 degree weather. 

He obviously didn't put the the t-shirt on that was two sizes too big so we left."}
{"text":"Ask for Bryn! She is the friendliest bartender ever! She has attention to detail and will make sure you have everything you asked for. The steaks are some of the best in town. This location is better than its counterparts: Hillstone, Bandera and Chelsea's kitchen. At least in the food department. The spinach dip and the French dip are a must. Hawaiian ribeye and the key lime pie!!! Just needs a full service patio."}
{"text":"We used to go to Houston's all of the time but for some reason it just sort of fell off of our radar for the past few years. We liked it before and they have really stepped up their game. Truly one of the best dining experiences we have had this year. The service was spot on and the pork roast that I had was outstanding! It has a great atmosphere and a really nice bar. The absolute only criticism that I have is that regardless of what time you have reservations your table is NEVER ready when you arrive. That aside, it is pretty much what a restaurant should be."}
{"text":"My family came to visit me from Chicago and wanted to go out for steak. Being from Chicago we have so many options and I didn't know where to take them. Out here everything is commercialized. Also most restaurants here are overpriced with poor quality food/ service. 

Houstons was recommended to me by a friend. My dad said he had the BEST steak he's ever eaten. That was music to my ears. The service was great and the ambiance too. The music playing was classy and classic. The French dip and seared tuna salad was excellent as well. 

I definitely recommend making a reservation!"}
{"text":"Oh boy, where do I start?  A colleague suggested that we come here for a lunch meeting one day.  He said they had the best French Dip Sandwich in town.  Seduced by this claim, I had to give this place a try.  Of course, my first time there I had to try this legendary Sandwich.  Priced at $20, it better be good...
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/houstons-scottsdale?select=U0ixpfN85zASG-5U8eBq1w#U0ixpfN85zASG-5U8eBq1w

I took one bite and OMG...!  It was friggin' awesome!  Even better than I expected.  The flavor of the Prime Rib and the Au Jus sent my taste buds into the stratosphere.  It also comes with a Creamy Horseradish Sauce that just adds to the flavor explosion.  The Bread is Buttered and soft, but had just the right texture to hold this all together and complimented the sharp flavors of the Beef and Sauce.  Wow, it is a masterpiece.

The service here is also impeccable.  You feel like you're dining in a 5 diamond restaurant....and it's lunch!

I was so impressed after that 1st visit, that I've been back several times and have brought many friends and colleagues to experience the French Dip.

My other favorite item is the Hickory Burger (Canadian Bacon, Cheddar Cheese, Onion, w/Hickory Sauce), $14.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/houstons-scottsdale?select=CYjS0T6wl1Pe9fX_-DV9mw#CYjS0T6wl1Pe9fX_-DV9mw
That's right folks, there's a thick slice of Canadian Bacon that tops this Burger!  This is a big bad Burger....and it tastes awesome!  I can barely take a bite out of it....and it's not like some freakishly huge Burger, but the ingredients are fresh and stacked high....making for an awesome Burger.

For sides, the Cole Slaw is by far the best you can order and I highly recommend that.  The Fries are so/so.  

Another tip, if you come for lunch you can make reservations.  It can get busy, so it's worth the extra step to do so.

Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"I have always love this place...especially during the hot summer months.  It's dark, nice and cool, service is usually pretty good & food has been consistently good.  Although, I do miss the coconut shrimp.  I always come for a glass of wine and an appetizer and/or salad.  It's a great location."}
{"text":"Houston's is one of many excellent restaurants you'll find in the greater Phoenix area. It's a little pricey but definitely worth it. 

It's a good place to go if you're just coming off the golf course and are looking for some good food and cold beverages."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The service is always top notch and there is nothing like the Hawaiian ribeye...if you haven't tried it, you're seriously missing out."}
{"text":"I love Houston's and dine there fairly frequently. Yesterday I decided to try something new for lunch. The grilled chicken sandwich. Cajun chicken breast, ham, Swiss cheese and sliced tomato. Sounds pretty good right? Wrong!  

It was terrible! No flavor whatsoever! It also came with about an inch of arugula piled on it. No mention of this on the menu. Arugula should be used sparingly on very specific things. Way too strong for an already flavorless sandwich. I had to pick it all off, then asked for a large side of mayonnaise to help choke the sandwich down.  

I will certainly be back, but I will stick with the other items I usually order. Houston's, why do you have I get cute with your sandwiches? Bring back a regular club that people really enjoy!  

I laughed to myself as I was getting ready to leave. There was a man sitting at a nearby table who sent the same sandwich back saying \"this is the worst sandwich I have ever had\". Me too sir! Me too!  I should have sent mine back!

Beware Houston's customers. The grilled chicken sandwich is terrible!!"}
{"text":"Houston's has long been know for its exceptional (truly exceptional) service. We used to remark that we never ran out of water. Unfortunately, Hillstone greatly exceeds Houston's in the service department. At Houston's, we can go for very long periods of time without getting our water glasses or tea refilled, even when a lot of servers pass our table. This can also be true of the bar area.  I hoping this can be corrected."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Houstons for a while so we decided to give it a try.  There was a long wait for a table, so we sat at the bar.  The bartendresses were friendly and attentive.  The menu has been scaled down since my last visit, so I decided to try the Flying Tuna Platter.  Very good, though a bit pricey.  My friend had the ribs, and thought they were very good as well.  

I don't know why I've stayed away so long.  I'll definitely go back more often!"}
{"text":"I took the girlfriend here Saturday night for a little date. We were looking for a last minute place to go and chose Houston's because we had been to both Bandera and Hillstone and loved them both. We showed up without a reservation at 8:30 on a Saturday night. We had to wait 10-15 to be seated. There was plenty of room at the bar so we had a drink while we waited. The restaurant is very nice on the inside although it is a little dark. I ordered the ribs with cole slaw and french fries. My girlfriend ordered the chicken with a  baked potato and broccoli. We were both extremely happy with our selections. The chicken may be the best chicken I have ever had. It is so juicy and full of flavor. The ribs were also excellent. We had a great experience and will certainly come back!!"}
{"text":"After putting our name in we were told it would be a 30 minute wait and decided to have a drink at the bar in the mean time. We noticed several tables were opened and and assumed they were short staffed. 15 minutes later after we had ordered our drinks and still did not receive them the hostess updated us that it would be an hour wait. When we agreed to continue to wait at the bar another server informed us we were out of dress code and would need to wear a large restaurant provided t-shirt. I am a frequent diner at this establishment and have left positive reviews in the past but when offered to adjust the outfit to adhere to dress code we were told it wasn't an option. The outfit was previously worn on a Friday night without any concern from the staff it is disconcerting especially for a frequent diner that used to visit once a week."}
{"text":"Would Not Return.  

Our party of 8, 6 adults and 2 small children wanted to celebrate my wife's birthday with a nice dinner.  My wife had eaten here previously and wanted to have dinner there.

She called for a reervation and was told that the seating was primarily booth seating and could be 'tight' for a party of 8.  Hostess was named Emily.  She suggested 2 booths, we declined.  She then said there was one large table but she could not reserve as it was first come, first served.  Since we were planning to be there at 5 PM, we assumed we could probably get the table due to the early hour.

When we arrived, it took 15 minutes for them to show us to our table.  It was a regular booth, judged too small by all of us.  Manager then got involved and showed us to a both that was \"3 inches bigger\".  No more than 3 inches, that's for sure.  We declined as asked about the table.  Manager said, and it was evident from looking, that there was no table.

When I said that \"Emily\" told us about a table the day before on the phone, she denied it.  Emily apparently has trouble with the truth.

We declined to eat at the restaurant and found another venue across the street.  After all, Scottsdale has lots of good restaurants.

I see that the other Houston's in Phoenix is now closed.  I don't doubt that the Scottsdale location will still follow due to their lack of customer service and inability to seat more than 4 people for dinner.  

Will never return. We found J. Alexander's right across the street.  Had everything a good restaurant should-large tables, excellent service, businesslike attitude and good food."}
{"text":"It's no secret that I am a fan of all things Houston's.  This location was no exception.  I found the more family-oriented crowd a refreshing change from the sometimes pretentious atmosphere of Los Angeles locations.  Friendly service, but some aspects were definitely not as polished as in LA.  In saying that, the sushi chefs had a full on conversation with my husband and I, whereas in other Houston's--you'll be lucky to get a smile from them.

The food was, of course, fabulous!  And they had one of our favorite wines on the list, Jeff Runquist.  The couple at the neighboring table also ordered the same bottle.  We ordered our favorite sushi, the coconut shrimp roll.  The consistency was all there!  Perfect, fresh and delicious.  Husband ordered the filet with a baked potato.  It looked measly when it arrived, dwarfed by the gigantic potato.  But the filet was nothing but tasty, perfectly grilled beefiness.  The potato was a bit dry inside.  I ordered my usual California Sushi Salad.  Huh?  What.....did they get the order mixed up?  This was not my usual CA Sushi Salad.  Beware, the salad is different here than in CA.  Completely different sushi.  Although it looked stunning, I really missed the CA style entree that is served in LA.  Oh well, when in Scottsdale......

Great live music and the usual wonderful Houston's atmosphere.  I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"So my husband and I came in for a nice night out, however after getting our app the waiter came over told us our burger and steak were cooked too much and they would be making us two new items bc they were over cooked and it would be a little longer but he offered us a round of drinks on the house so ok. 
Then the burger came out wrong after 20 min and the steak was still overcooked and as we appreciated the manager coming over to apologize we still were basically without no food after being there for 45 min. 
We did finally get our food an hour later but just not ok in the end."}
{"text":"In 2017 they tell women to \"cover up\". Decided to give them a second chance and treat my mom to dinner. they kicked  my  boyfriend out for wearing a tank top whilst there was someone at the bar also wearing one.  Very condescending management. The service was very rushed and after the incident they basically shoved the bill on my face. Ruined what could've been a nice dinner with my mom and my boy. My poor Mama was horrified. I WILL NEVER give Houston'a my business again."}
{"text":"This is the Scottsdale Houston's -- the top notch of the bunch -- and it easily surpasses the already impressive service and presentation of the Esplanade Houston's hands down.

Unfortunately, you know the action/reaction thing? It applies in this case, as well, and while the Esplanade Houston's will sit you on a twenty minute wait, get comfortable with a forty minute plus wait on peak hours around here. 

Sure, the regulars get preferential treatment, as it should be, I suppose. I mean, if I am shelling some extraordinary percentage of my paychecks to one particular establishment, I would want it, too. But, for the lot of you that aren't regulars, that spells trouble. 

Once you get a seat, you are in for a wonderful, albeit pricey, meal. If your in a rush, my advice is to call ahead or go at an off hour."}
{"text":"Hawaiian ribeye is simply delicious. The service is awesome. The mood that is set is brilliant. I will always come back. To be honest I'm gonna be taking a client of mine here for dinner this weekend. But my advice is to stay away from the smoked salmon appetizer. I rebuke salmon. It is gross. I tried... I honestly I did. Salmon just doesn't work for me. Sorry."}
{"text":"It's a chic steakhouse tavern. Having not returned to it after many years, I was pleasantly surprised by the food, courtesy and accomodations. I took a chance on the French Dip Sandwich, and was dunkin' the top of the line baguette and roast beef in the best of au jus dipping sauce. My friend next to me order the Pork Beef Ribs and we decided to tag team -- we felt like we were eating a whole animal. The Pale Ale swished all excess down nicely. For dessert, we couldn't help it: We got the ice cream sundae and we got first-rate hot fudge served from an ol' fashioned Gravy Boat. Decadence.

This particular Houston's in Scottsdale, AZ has good live music Thursday thru Saturday nights. Cool Kats. Hey, to be straight- up about it: This Scottsdale, AZ location is the best \"Houstons\" I've ever been to, by far."}
{"text":"Houstons will never get old in my book! I've been coming to houstons since I was a kid in Pasadena, California. The Service has always been impeccable and you can't go wrong with anything you chose to order. If you get a chance, order the spinach dip and the Hickory Burger! (Hickory burger is no longer on the menu but they will still make it for you) Hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"hawaiin ribeye and the hickory burger!!!!!  not only the meat but the shoe string fries are awesome too.  arnold palmers are heaven.

i love this place!  it has a very professional feel.  it's dark, clean, quiet, and awesome interior design.  the service is some of the best in phx.

i wish i could visit this place more often.  thanks houston's for setting the standard on my tastebuds."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Pasadena California and decided to eat where I knew the food would be guaranteed yummy as well as have an awesome atmosphere ( along with my two best friends.) I frequent the location in Pasadena California and I completely forgot I was in another state while dining here.
The service is impeccable ( our server Paula so very pleasant) and the food is nothing less than AMAZING! 

We had to wait a little longer than expected beyond the time of our reservation and the staff along with the Manager Sydney was amazing at making sure we were taken care of. With out a second thought I will be back to this location as I visit Scottsdale often. Thanks Houstons for holding up to your name Clap Clap Clap!!!"}
{"text":"LAte afternoon lunch, stopped in last minute and had a great meal. Busy place for 4pm on a Sunday. 
Pleasant service....... recommended. 
Well come back when it's not 116 degrees"}
{"text":"How I do love the Houston's family.  Every restaurant, every experience is completely, consistently exceptional.  Our server was professional and had perfect timing as expected.  We started with the spinach dip, had 3 orders of the Prime Rib, 2 Thai Salads, and one order of Flying Chicken and each was outstanding.  There's not much more to say except that we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Houston's is only good if you like consistent, outstanding service, food served quickly, prepared perfectly and delicious.  It's not cheap, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"They have poor customer service. I will not be going back. Pretty sad because it used to be a place we went frequently."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great service.  The potions were perfect and the food was delicious.  Price was high for the portions but still would recommend."}
{"text":"After walking in I was half greeted by 3 girls in white shirts at the front.  Unnecessarily snotty I might add.  It was lunch on a wed. Almost full restaurant but we managed to get  seats in the bar.

Our server was good. He was pretty attentive  about keeping up with refills.  Nice touch with the frozen glasses for sodas.  Seemed knowledgable as well.

I ordered the California seabass.  Was a little like halibut.  Seemed a bit dry as did my friend's swordfish.  Both needed a lot of sauce to make up for the dryness.  The spaghetti squash side was undercooked but still ok.  No one really enjoyed the little tomatos doused in olive oil they serve with the fish.  Everything seemed just drowned in oil or butter.    Nice selections on the menu though.  I would definetly give it another shot.  Hopefully the guest services girls at the front lighten up a little bit though next time."}
{"text":"Houstons has been one of my favorite places to eat in the Scottsdale area for years. Whenever I'm in town, I make a point to stop in. The quality of the food is phenomenal (and the prices are in line with that) and the service is usually top-notch. The atmosphere is Southwestern Swanky so you get that cool, old school vibe. The leather booths and dark lighting gives it a classy, mysterious setting.

I'm a low carb eater so my go-to menu item is their cheeseburger (sans bun) with the vegetable of the day (make sure to ask what the veggies are and if they say spaghetti squash or brussels sprouts, ORDER THEM! They are by far my favorite). Their standard veggies, or ones they usually have all year, are sauteed spinach or broccoli with Parmesan cheese on top. The burgers are SO GOOD here because they grind them fresh in-house. You'll be paying close to $15 for one, but they are tasty.

I prefer to eat here at lunch time on the weekends when it's not so crowded. Evenings tend to feel a bit too \"formal\" and the place gets packed with the worker crowd during lunch hours on weekdays. Plus, if you go on Saturday, they have their awesome chili! Even if you choose to dine here on a weekend day, make sure you dress a bit nicer than a t-shirt and jeans. Jeans are okay, but you might feel under dressed in a t-shirt."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Rude and condescending hosting staff. Don't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"While the food is one of our main reasons for coming back, the service is the reason for my review being written. We've been coming to this Houston's for about 15 years and the service has always been reliable and warm but our last server really raised the bar. We had JC(?) at lunch last week and his poise, polish and ease left nothing to be wanted. He has the finesse that you'd expect from fine dining. Serving is not an easy job and he really nails it. First time we've had him and we really enjoyed our experience. Went in after a rough morning and lunch completely turned that around:) Usually we have Amanda and she's the absolute sweetest. Has the warmest demeanor and always delivers a perfect meal anticipating our needs so intuitively while keeping a very smooth service. One goes out to eat to be free of stress and these two definitely achieve that here. We'll definitely be back and we'll be asking for either Amanda or JC:)"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Houston's! I've been to the one in Miami, Atlanta, Phoenix, Scottsdale and Chicago (the Chicago one closed) and they are all fabulous! The service is outstanding and the spinach dip is awesome! Actually, everything on the menu is great! Don't forget the dessert too! The apple walnut cobbler is yummy! I love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food is good. My main complaint is this is Arizona, folks!  It is 91 degrees in February today. I asked for the iced tea in a to go cup and was told they do not have to go cups. What?  Much finer establishments than yours offer those to those of us who try to survive this desert heat with a trusty, ice cold refreshment for our cars.  What snobbery.  How ridicululous. You really need to re think this.  Won't be back until this policy changes."}
{"text":"Good steak, Great Service and reasonable price!"}
{"text":"The lovely Kristen and myself got all dressed up last night and headed for one of my favorite restaurants, Houston's. Geez, I like this place a lot, it's one of the few restaurants where if I had the option, I would eat there every day. 

      We had reservations for 6:45 and were quickly greeted and sat right down. The place is always lively, always a crowd and always a little noisy, just the way it should be. I got a tasty Jack and Diet and she a glass of white wine as we started with their famous spinach dip. Nowadays it seems every restaurant is throwing a dip of some type together, but none come within thirty feet of the deliciousness that is the Houston's spinach dip. Their chips are crispy and fresh, the spinach dip itself is so flavorful and thick and has big chunks of artichoke in it, it also comes with a side of both salsa and sour cream which compliment the dip beautifully. What a treat! 

      On to the main course! I moved over to a beer for the entree, Sierra Nevada Heff I think, mighty fine, and the lady stuck with the wine. I ordered the Hawaiian rib-eye (I'm drooling just typing it) and Kristen had the prime rib, both ordered medium rare. My rib-eye was absolutely incredible... the outside simply burst with this delicious Hawaiian marinade, goodness, if only I could describe the flavor, and the inside was cooked perfectly to my taste, the meat was tender and bursting with its own cow goodness. I could only manage one bite before shoving a taste in the mouth of my partner, who also declared it a natural wonder. The steak came with a potato but I opted for fries with a side of homemade buttermilk ranch for dipping. I could write a novel on these delicious fries, but just try them, get a side of their homemade ketchup as well, wow. Her prime rib was beautiful, absolutely beautiful. Cooked very well, lots of meat, tasty, tender and came with a savory au jus sauce, bursting with goodness. She had the potato which came with the prime rib and looked like a football covered in cheese and bacon (not bacon bits, big chunks of bacon), and man was it good. I occasionally wondered if I chose wrong with the fries, but I didn't, shoot, order them both I say! 

      The only sort of negative of the night was our waitress, she just happened to be new and a little naive, or careful maybe? She was overly cautious about our age, checking our IDs more than once (I'm 28) and forgetting our drink orders twice. I completely forgive this, it was busy, she was new and had several tables, no big deal at all, she was a sweetheart. 

      If you have never visited Houston's, I highly recommend it, they have many dinner options and even a sushi bar! The atmosphere is super nice and inviting, it is dimly lit and romantic. I love this place. Four and a Half Stars."}
{"text":"One of my favorite's at Houston's is their Prime Rib French Dip sandwich. This savory sandwich just melts in your mouth, topped with horseradish and dipped in the accompanied au jus sauce with the housemade bun...makes me want to run out for another one.

The shoestring fries and a side order of cole slaw made this lunch a complete meal.

Our server Paulina was a delight. Very attentive and professional."}
{"text":"Went here last evening. Had the trout....it was HORRIBLE!!! tasted muddy and bugy...not something they should have on their menu. Their cheapest wine is $11.00 and is bitter.  Now this is not a high end restaurant so having wine prices starting at $11.00 for a cheap wine you can get at Total Wine for about $7.00 a bottle is a bit much!  Also charging $10.00 for a house rum and coke is also a bit much when the rum tastes watered down. You can get a Bacardi (if drink it you can tell the difference) and coke at a much better restaurant for $6.00 or $7.00, REALLY? Cannot recommend this place and I know we will never be back.  There are much better restaurants in Scottsdale where you won't get ripped off and the food is much, much better!"}
{"text":"The service was exceptional during our last visit.

Everyone from the hostess - manager- bus people - wait team and especially our waitress Holly, were team oriented and driven to take care of us. We had a premium corner round table for six of us, water was constantly filled, drinks/food were delivered quickly and we we're checked in on as needed throughout our drinks/appetizers/salads and entre's. 

The shrimp sushi was particularly tasty, a recommendation from Holly.

Holly was really on the ball, pleasant and well informed on anything that was asked of her. 

Between Bandera's down the road, Houston's on Camelback and this Houston's - I prefer this place of the three. The overall ambiance spoke to me and put me into a comfortable/fun experience zone."}
{"text":"I left still craving their Thai noodle salad even though I was stuffed! Every restaurant I go to now I look for something similar, that's how good this place is. A must go to place in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Houston's is one of those places that never disappoints.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, lights dimmed just right, and food ALWAYS wonderful.  

I used to only get the ribs here, and they are still my favorite.  Best in town.  Since my brother started working here I have expanded my choices.  First of all, they have sushi now.  Weird, I know, for an upscale American restaurant, but its really delicious.  Its not traditional sushi of course, but wonderful none the less.  Their veggie burger is one of my favorites anywhere, the seasonal veggie plate is awesome, and the thai steak and noodle salad is perfect.  Their coleslaw is the best I've ever had and the rice and beans side is surprisingly satisfying.  If they have Key Lime Pie, GET IT!!!!  You must save room or you are missing out!

The next thing I'm going to try is an order of ribs with a bun and coleslaw.  My brother says its the best sandwich you'll ever have.  Wow...i'm salivating.....Time for dinner!"}
{"text":"My son and I enjoyed our scrumptious steak dinners before he headed back to Afghanistan.
One of my all time favorite steak houses."}
{"text":"I've been to Houston's several times over the last couple of years but the last time I went was the best! My boyfriend and I wanted a good steak so we decided to come here one Friday night. We had to wait for a little bit but that didn't bother me and it was worth it. First we got the spinach dip which was delicious. He got the prime rib and I got the filet and I'm pretty sure that was the first time I ate a steak and actually loved it. Sooooo good. I think it came with mashed potatoes and some vegetables on the side. I tried his too and it was good but I thought the filet was better. It wasn't a super cheap meal that's for sure but we knew that going into it. Our server was really friendly as well. We'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Houston's is as good as it gets! My favorite is the Hawaiian Rib Eye with a loaded baked potato. I always start with the spinach dip or the artichokes, sometimes both if my party is big enough. I always top it off with the ice cream sundae, which is just out of this world. Hot gooey fudge that you can pour on yourself and candied nuts.. mmmmmm... 

My most recent experience was nearly ruined by a loud mouth wearing a T-Shirt and dining with a rather trashy looking gal. He was telling lude stories about his recent trip to Vegas and the volume of his voice was less than appropriate for the dimly lit, laid back atmosphere Houston's provides. I flagged down a server nearby and she kindly relocated me to the other side of the restaurant. 

I really wish they had a dress code here to keep scrubs like that from ever ruining classy folk's meals. Thanks again though, to the staff!"}
{"text":"Another great lunch at Houston's. We've gone several times over the years and have never been disappointed. The food quality and service are always exceptional. Thank you for a great Valentine's Day lunch."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly on a Saturday night. Beef dip, fish sandwich, and pork fillet were all great. Our server Jeffery was the very best. We finished with the chocolate brownie. It was fantastic. We will be back very soon"}
{"text":"Houston, we have a problem. 
I wanted the ribeye but it's Hawaiian style and that's the only way they serve it. There were no other meat options that looked appealing on the limited menu so I ended up getting the pork chop. The pork chop is very thick and has a very burnt crust. The sides were mediocre, a baked potato and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes taste like the kind made from flakes. Yuck. 
There are no kid friendly Options so my daughter got the chicken tender plate which was horrible.  Definitely not worth the $17. 
They serve soda from a bottle which is ridiculous! The lemonade is so bitter I got heart burn with every sip. 
The service was ok not what I expected for the prices. Our waitress told us to stack our menus at the end of the table when we are ready to order. This was really strange to me. I like to have my menu in front of me when I'm ordering so I dont have to memorize what I want. How hard is it to check in like every other waitress. 

Bottom line this is not my scene. I'm not into a very limited menu with disappointing food. The food does not justify the price."}
{"text":"Going to Houston's either on Scottsdale or on Camelback is like throwing dice. Sometimes its good and sometimes its not at all. Over the years and I have been eating there for years the staff has become less and less polished. I've watched it go from slacks to jeans and very attractive staff to just ok. 

It's not cheap to eat there and you expect the food to be consistent but it always isn't. My wife loves the fall vegetable plate but the last two times it was not good the fish that I ordered was very overcooked. I sent it back and the wait staff rolled her eyes. 

One other time (years ago) I was waiting with my wife and another couple and we waiting for 30 mins which was normal and person came in with his friends and handed the front person 100.00 it looked like and they were seated right away. I asked the wait girl how much she made a week and she looked shocked that I caught her. She said excuse me walked away I didn't see her for the rest of the night another person seated us 10 mins after that. I wrote a letter to the corp office and never got a letter back. 

The real money they make is made off the snowbirds that come in for the winter. So during the winter I would avoid this place. 

Good Luck."}
{"text":"Of the national chains, Houston's is in my top-3.  The restaurant is always energetic, the food is always great, and the service I've had is always top-notch.  The really should be commended for their knowledge and consistency on that front. 

The last time we were there we went with the smoked salmon appetizer (awesome and I don't usually like smoked fish), the ribs (actually not the quality I've experienced at Houston's), and the French Dip (very good) but you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu.  

If you're looking for an upscale dining experience this should always be a consideration."}
{"text":"As we were driving to another restaurant my boyfriend saw this place and so \" look it's Houston's\"!    I had no clue but he said he had been to one in TX.   So needless to say we turned around.   After entering the restaurant he realized it wasn't the same establishment but we decided to give it a shot.  Atmosphere is very dark with dim lighting and very simple.  He ordered the pork chop which was seasoned perfect.  I ordered the salmon which was unbelievable.   It came with brussel sprouts which were scrumptious....I could have ate more!   We both had mashed potatoes that had a good flavor but were cold.  Would go back but not on the top of my list."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Houston's in a while, but ended up there last night for dinner. 

After the meal we were wondering why we didn't go more often...

Houston's is delicious...It's in the Hillstone family, so it's like Bandera with a larger menu and less of a southwestern flair. Probably my favorite Caesar salad right now, great sides and their burgers and ribs are amazing.

Last night, I had the Hickory burger and a caesar, while my wife had a salad and a baked potato. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals, and the service was impeccable.  Seems like the service really sets Houston's apart from a lot of other restaurants. My water glass would be close to empty, and then all of a sudden I'd look over and it would be full...They must hire food and water ninjas that sneak up on you and provide great service. I'm not complaining.

I've yet to order a steak there, but I hear they're good. There are a lot of other places that I'd rather order a steak though, so I think I'll stick to my standbys.  

4 stars because it's always a wait...Always. I know, I know, it's not Houston's fault, it's the fault of the country club snowbirds that park their range rovers and make me jealous that I don't have that kind of money. Kidding...Sort of. Seriously though, if you go on a Wednesday at 4:30pm, expect to wait 10 minutes. Lunch can be a 15-20 minute wait usually and peak dinner times can be 30-45 minutes. Houston's does take reservations, so if you're planning on going there for dinner, it's best to call at least an hour ahead and make a reservation. 

If you've yet to dine at Houston's, do it ASAP. If you haven't been in a while, go back. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yes, the food is excellent - but, what keeps me coming back is the exceptional service - - this is the type of service that other restaurants should try and emulate - - the waitstaff is excellently trained and they are proud to work there - and that shows!"}
{"text":"Horrible Horrible customer service on the phone. We haven't even been to this place yet, and it was HORRIBLE!! Very disappointed, was recommended by several people... poor poor customer service. Gal on the phone was extremely rude, and we were just calling to ask some questions..."}
{"text":"Houstons is my favorite spot for lunch. Great wine list when it's not a business lunch. Sounds silly but get the chicken tenders, they will not disappoint. A child's dish done in an adult manner. The service is always great."}
{"text":"Wife and I went to Houston's after leaving another place for terrible service..we waited a while for a table but having been here at 8pm on a Saturday, it was expected. Kat served us in the lounge area by the bar while we waited and chatted us up for a few minutes. 
We sat down at a nice table on the back wall with a view of the entire restaurant. People watching is one of our favorite things to do so it worked out. I had a burger and she had the lunch chx salad. All we're delicious and Holly was great as well!! We'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Just got to Sumomaya with friends.......we were at Houston's and the bartender insulted my husband. He had one and a half drinks, we were seated at a table for dinner, my husband stepped up to the bar with our friend just to have a conversation away from the table and get another drink and the bartender refused to serve him. And the way she did it was very rude and embarrassing. We had already ordered our dinner and they had just brought our appetizers, but :after talking to the manager who supported the bartender, we got up and left. We are not young punks who drink too much. I don't drink at all and my husband is a very successful business owner here in Scottsdale, AZ, works very hard and on the weekend likes to start his Friday night with one or two cocktails, three at the most. We live year round and frequent Houston's quite often. Here we are at Sumomaya having a fabulous time. We will NEVER EVER go back to Houston's again and will urge our friends do the same. I have rated them poorly on Google also. I have never seen my husband so insulted and angry as tonight. And it started out so well with my husband having a good time talking to a gentleman at the bar and our friends............you're missing out Houston's........we're here year round when all the snowbirds go back to wherever......you need a lesson in diplomacy! I would give you a zero but that's not an option.

It's not like we're some young kids who drink too much. My husband is a very successful business owner and we live in Scottsdale year round. We frequent Houston's quite often because we like the food and the service and my husband likes to have one or two drinks on Friday to wind down from his week. I do not drink at all so I'm our built in DD. No one has ever treated us more disgracefully than that bartender and then the manager either was not trained well enough in customer relations/communications to handle it properly.

I NEVER give bad reviews of restaurants since I grew up in a gourmet restaurant and would never want to affect someone's business adversely. I only post positive reviews, but this was definitely an exception that was called for........"}
{"text":"Good food and good place.

Had dinner last night here with my girlfriend. 

The restaurant and atmosphere was nice. We were early for our reservation and they still had room and seated us early. Staff was very friendly. 

I had the prime rib and my girlfriend had the trout. Both were very good. The steak was huge and cooked just how I ordered. Also, both dinner entrees came out quickly. 

Food, drink, atmosphere all were top level."}
{"text":"This place was very yummy. I went here for my boyfriends 21st birthday & everything was very elegant! We both enjoyed our dinner. However, I did not really like how they didn't have a complimentary birthday ice cream or small dish for someone celebrating their birthday... other than that it was pretty good!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the center cut filet steak today.  It was tender and perfectly delicious.  My side dish was a fresh garden salad with an olive oil and balsamic dressing.  The service was excellent and atmosphere, as usual, was terrific."}
{"text":"3.5 stars
Service is great here! The food was okay. I was recommended to order the Seared Ahi Tuna salad and although they had removed it from the menu, they were nice enough to put it together for me and another in our party. The tuna part was ok but the lettuce had much too much dressing to eat. The mango pieces were a nice touch. We also ordered the Spinich Dip Yelpers recommended but it was nothing special."}
{"text":"The best ribs always. Tortilla Soup, Ribs, and a Pacifico.  That's what I have every visit and it's always awesome.  If it's in, ill eat the peach cobbler because that's their best dessert IMO."}
{"text":"One of my favorites!!  Houston's is always consistent with great food and wonderful service.  Definitely make a reservation as the place is always busy.  My favorite is the Hawaiian Ribeye!"}
{"text":"Great service. Great food ( soup, app, burger, salads). Great atmosphere. Completely enjoyed."}
{"text":"Passed this on our way home yesterday. Went in on a whim - and SO glad we did.
The staff was fantastic and well-trained, to the point that they visibly cleared a path when you walked down the aisle to the restroom - it was a bit more than 'just' stepping aside.
It was lunch, we'd already had a snack so really weren't looking for a big meal. The menu wasn't huge, but there were great choices.

I had the (I believe it's called) \"Flying Chicken\" and my hubby had a burger (I think it was a barbecue burger). He says his burger was perfect and full of flavor. The chicken tenders were SO very lightly battered and fried, thus the 'flying' reference in the name. They were cooked perfectly. The chicken tenders were served with two sauces, honey mustard and BBQ. The chicken was so good that I tried the sauces, just for the sake of trying them, but didn't use them beyond the initial taste (but they were good).

The burger came with fries, I didn't even ask the hubs what he thought about them. He said he was VERY pleased at the end of the meal - so I'll suggest he thought they were good. The chicken tenders were served with a tasty slaw. I'll almost bet they made it themselves, it doesn't taste anything like any I've had before.

The place was comfortable, comfortable living room-like wood and dark colors. But it wasn't so dark that you couldn't see who was sitting in front of you. If you have a chance, I highly suggest you go. We'll be back again, perhaps for dinner next time."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favs but time after time the food was mediocre and the wait staff was snooty. We no longer visit Houstons. 

The ribs and burgers are good and we still haven't found a place that comes close to the spinach dip but I think the wait staff needs some training in common courtesy."}
{"text":"Good food and attentive service aside, visiting Houston's feels exactly like being sent back in time and dropped off in the middle of a 80's Robert Palmer video.

Admiring each and every passing server; their hair slicked back tightly, bright red lipstick, and tight, form-fitting black skirt, I have to wonder if Houston's was Palmer's inspiration for his videos.
It was truly a head-turning, awe-inspiring event.

Eat the ribs, best item on the menu, (and enjoy the fashion show!)"}
{"text":"So I will say the service was impeccable. We came for lunch and it was surprisingly not busy. We had a baby with us and instead of using high chairs, they have one that connects to the table. I like that so much more because then the baby isn't sticking out in the aisle and they can feel included in the meal as well and right by mom/dad/whomever. They offer a very large bar with some craft cocktails. Only 2 of us were drinking and only one get a cocktail. It was a moscow mule. The drink itself was good, nothing over the top and it didn't come in a copper cup. They do have a good wine selection, somewhat limited in by the glass options but I made due and got a really nice Sav Blanc from New Zealand. I will say the pour is a little heavy and I love it! As for the food, 2 people split the Hawaiian ribeye as per the recommendation of our server. The portion was large for one person so it was perfect for 2. They asked for medium and it came medium with some parts a little medium rare so they were very happy. The char on it was perfect. My husband got the famous french dip. It was enormous. I think it was about 6 inches thick and mostly meat. It also looked like it was freshly sliced meat because it didn't have that dark brown crusted edge to it but was pink and clean cut. It was excellent. The portion was also huge, he struggled to finish it. Finally, I got the Thai steak salad and wow! I can't wait to go back and get it again. The amount of dressing was just right, it had a great spice to it but not enough that I wanted to grab water every few seconds. The portion was very large but I had no problem finishing it and basically licking the plate after. I would highly recommend this one. We finished the meal with their famous ice cream sundae. Before you laugh, it was more than enough for 4 of us to share and they give you a gravy boat of hot fudge on the side. Did you hear me- a GRAVY boat full of fudge. Yes, we used our spoons and finished the fudge that way. Definitely worth the calories."}
{"text":"Went there twice on my trip to Arizona.  The food was awesome and the service was tremendous.  The spinach artichoke dip,  shrimp cocktail and the grilled brussel sprouts we're awesome, great way to start a meal."}
{"text":"I am typically a fan of Houston's restaurant. I remember their dishes being very good, and I remember having a fondness for their ribs. It's like an upscale Charlestons in my opinion. However, I was not treated to the wonderful dining experience that I remember Houston's having.

On this afternoon I ordered light. I started off with the baked potato soup, and I ordered the $15 Veggie plate.  Here's what's on the veggie plate - 
a small serving of braised red cabbage with goat cheese, 3 half cherry tomatoes, 3 broc stalks, 6-7 tri-colored uncooked carrots, bread, and maybe 7 peas.  You've got to be kidding me.

The veggie's were barely cooked, sprinkled with salt, pepper, and a little olive oil. I was severely disappointed.

I remember the food being better, and next time will not make the mistake of getting the WAY overpriced veggie plate, and will stick to the usual ribs. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago, so when my family and I come to AZ every year for vacation, we always come here! We miss Houston's in Chicago. The spinach dip is to die for! LOVE IT! The grilled chicken salad is awesome! I prefer no peanut sauce on it and I get the honey mustard dressing. DELISH!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that I have not had the impeccable service that we received last night in a long time ! Our server Demetri was incredibly fastidious,gracious ,witty and all around amazing. We had a large party of 6 and we were all gushing about the service and the quality of food . Three of us had the ribs and we were in pork heaven & the other three tried the salads ...what a fantastic meal, not to mention the chocolate sundae and apple cobbler ! What we all raved about was the consistency of Houston's and how it is a staple here in Scottsdale, ambience..staff& food quality make this establishment a MUST!"}
{"text":"In an effort to help Todd F. on his Arizona steak search, we went to check out Houston's. After all I have heard about it and how much I liked it, I'm a bit disappointed I waited so long to check it out.

Both of us ordered the NY Strip steak with mine being medium rare. It was perfectly done and melt in your mouth tender. I'm not a big baked potato fan but that was what came with the steak (fully loaded) and it was nothing short of awesome. If all baked potatoes were like that, I'd be in potato heaven.

I will definitely be back sometime in the very near future!"}
{"text":"My 1st time here and very impressed. Very nice inside restaurant and bar. Service was wonderful and so were the meals--my wife had the arctic char and I had a dinner salad with salmon. Could hardly be better. We will definitely return when we're back in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and everything was great ..  from the food to the incredible service.  Alex was our waitress. She was very good and friendly and her \"team\" that she had behind her was awesome. (Bill and Manager, Kyle to name just two of the many that serviced our table)  Been here a few times and every time has been an enjoyable experience with last night being the best!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My parents have been bringing me to houstons since I was really young. I've always LOVED the flying chicken platter, and even now when I go I'm tempted to order it. I've never had a bad meal at houstons and everything is always noticeably clean which I always appreciate. Service is quick, and the ambiance is absolutely lovely. I've never been with anyone who's said anything bad about their meal either. You absolutely can't miss their hot fudge sundae!"}
{"text":"I miss the old location across from the Biltmore -  it was a swanky spot :) But this location is all we have now and I consider myself lucky there is still a Houston's in town. Great food and wonderful ambiance! The drinks are poured by bartenders who know a thing or two about, well...pouring drinks.  Its where you'd dine if you were in a detective noire film..Bogart style. Its a timeless and classy joint. Very much a fine dining experience and yes you can dress it up or down and still expect top flight service and a wonderful meal! Love the roast beef sandwich...incredible. Steaks, seafood and specials also delight. 

Houston's has a \"vibe\" - its those low lights, mahogany booths and the neon clock. It keeps me coming back. I love dining there and it endures as a favorite upper echelon spot to eat while being able to dispense with some of the \"stuffiness\"that other comparable dining establishments require. A++"}
{"text":"I came tonight as I do often, there was 5 of us. We got here at 5:30 (eating with the old folks crowd) and the hostess said it would be a 30 minute wait. We waited until 6:10 and asked about our table....she now says 25minutes. When I asked why it would be another 25, she rudely told us that she quoted 45 mins at first. Liar! I like this place but with bad staff from the get-go I don't know if I'll come back. Here I come White Chocolate Grill - food is as good or better and the staff is great!"}
{"text":"Exceptional! My husband and I went on our first date here and we try to make it a monthly date night still. Absolutely everything on my menu is outstanding, the service is always on point. By far our favorite place, if you get the waitress/bar tender Bryn - she is the sweetest!"}
{"text":"Houston's has great food, generous drinks (glass wine list need desperate help though), and stuck up waiters.  It is that simple. 
French Dip   =5 stars
Spinach dip = 5 stars 
Ribs             =5 stars
Sea bass      =5 stars
Service         =2 stars. Would it kill them to smile?

Get over yourselfs and be nice.  I bet I have eaten at this location at least a dozen times this year and I can't remember any server saying a simple Thank You for dinning with us from any of my servers.  

And it is just this location... Coral Gables, Aventura, Palm Beach, 23rd & 5th in NYC, Hackensack ... All offer great service so let's get it together Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"The wait was about an hour on a Friday night at 6:00 pm for a party of 2. But that is to be expected. To start your meal the spinach artichoke dip is a must have! So creamy and good. It's a smaller bowl though so if you have more than 2 people eating I suggest more than one. The ribs and steak are the best I have ever had. Seriously. I am not a rib fan, but when I tried these, I changed my mind completely. It is very expensive but it is worth the money for the amazing food, atmosphere, and a special night out!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this Houstons for 17 years and it's still my favorite restaurant. The consistency in food quality, service and atmosphere make this place home."}
{"text":"Houstons does not disappoint.  I enjoy their salads for a quick lunch. I love their steaks for a lovely dinner. Their bar area is small but great servers and great service. It can be crowded so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Houston's has a dedication to excellence the like of which I have rarely seen.  They strive perfection at all times, even down to the smallest details.

Have you ever noticed that every server walks in a clockwise fashion around the room?  They'll walk 50 feet out of their way just to avoid turning around and going against the flow.

The food is great and on that rare, rare occasion where they do mess something up, they are guaranteed to make it up to you."}
{"text":"Weird.... unlike your sister company in SF, you do not have grilled artichokes everyday but you have key lime pie everyday!  Complete opposite of SF!"}
{"text":"Holly at the bar is embarrassingly rude, snotty, unhelpful and inattentive.  Ally on the other hand is cheerful, helpful and friendly.

For the prices you pay here, both the bad attitudes, as well as the drama between the bartenders and the wait staff/managers is just unacceptable.

The prime rib was good and the potato even better.  For $30 it should be I guess.  Just hoping for a better experience.  We've had MUCH better luck at Mastro's, City Hall, Flemming's, etc."}
{"text":"For what they charge it is disappointing that they cannot accommodate large parties or ensure that you will not sit on opposite ends of the restaurant from each other. Girl on the phone hung up on when I asked if there was any way she could possibly check to see if we could sit next to each other at 2 tables. I work in the customer service industry so I completely understand how to handle situations and cut people some slack!!!"}
{"text":"Every Houston's I've been to has two things: great food and great service. I've never been disappointed by this upscale restaurant chain. I had my usual Thai Steak Salad for dinner, and there was a tad bit more dressing than I liked, but the food quality was still wonderful."}
{"text":"100% would recommend everyone to try this place. 
This restaurant is always my best spot when I travel to Arizona. Their customer service and food are top notch period. I haven't found a restaurant that can beat them in these areas. I haven't tried its bar tho.

Best dishes: 
 
1st: Prime Rib (Medium rare). 
2nd: Roti Chicken. 
3rd: Pork Ribs."}
{"text":"I have been going to Houstons since I lived in Dallas, the scottsdale location is so busy. My date thought he could just show up a 545 and get a table at 6 on a Sunday night. Hahahaha We were lucky to get in at 645. Our waitress was so nice, she was from North Carolina and had an excellent personality and helped us puck great wine. I really liked her. I had melt in your mouth salmon with a delicious wine and caper lemon sauce and my date really enjoyed his bbq ribs.  I wish we could eat there every night bit at 90.00 for dinner, it will prob be just every once awhile. Be sure to call ahead a day or 2 before for a reservation!"}
{"text":"I have always loved Houston's. They were easier to find in Atlanta - I think this is the only one in the Phoenix area. Service is always top-notch. The food is fabulous. My friend and I had the Spinach and Artichoke dip. I had the salmon and my friend had a burger. It was delicious. The ambiance is nice. Not sure there is much of a bar scene, but had a drink at the bar with a few folks dining there. During high season - make reservations!"}
{"text":"Love this place ... great wait staff ... great bar food .. good atmosphere! Usually packed .. suggest reservations on Thursday, Friday & Saturday. 
Clean , quiet... just enjoyable!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite choices for steak and quality food, the service is excellent and prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"I always try to visit houstons when ever I can find one
They have the best chicken fingers I have ever had
They are not on the menu but they do have them
They are a must try
Yeas chicken fingers you wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"A fellow contractor and I met here Tuesday 11-7-17 for lunch.  We meet 2 to 3 times per week at various Scottsdale locations for lunch.  No fast food.  Nicer places.  We sit at the bar, have ice tea and lunch.
We go up to the bar and begin taking a seat when the bartender asks me if I have another shirt as they do not allow tank tops.  Everyday for the past 25 years in my own business I wear a company tank top and gym shorts.  I gave up the suit and tie a long time ago.  In the approximately 3,750 times I have eaten lunch out in the past 25 years I have NEVER been told I could not be there due to my tank top.  It was clean, no stains and I am clean cut and clean shaven.  
To top it off the two women next to us were wearing tank tops?  Well, the joke is on them because every week my wife and mother -in-law meet for dinner there.  I get the credit card bill so I know that HOUSTON'S will now be short an average of $208 per week as the ladies will no longer be going there.
We went across the lot to the tap house and had a nice lunch and the manager laughed at our houston's story and was glad to have our business.  I highly recommend the TAP HOUSE.  I have told literally ALL of my friends to cease going to HOUSTON'S because apparently if you are a successful contractor you are NOT welcome there if you are dressed casual.  Seriously, who does Houston's think they are?  It is not the Ritz Carlton for crying out loud."}
{"text":"Amazing service, quality, and delicious eats. A classic and never disappoints. I recommend the ribs with the huge baked potato that is truly a meal in itself, prime rib, French dip sandwich, club salad, steaks, all the appetizers, good the tortilla soup is to die for but I always forget which day they serve it on. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu
Martinis are extra yummy, and they even set you up with a chilled glass halfway through! Talk about \"the little things!\" 

If you like desserts and even if you don't-- the warm 5 nut brownie will change your life. It isn't on the menu anymore, not quite sure why-- but it is fantastic. Bourbon(?)  flavored Carmel sauce, warm gooey brownie with a delicious crunch and the most delectable vanilla ice cream. *drool*"}
{"text":"I've always thought it was only a  step above CoCo's.    Confused with the success.  Samo samo,,,   yawn."}
{"text":"Best go-to restaurant. Its consistently good. Burger, French Dip, Thai Steak & Noodle Salad, Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Ribs(amazing), Hawaiian Rib-eye are all fantastic. Service is consistently good too. No complaints."}
{"text":"Houston's focuses on having the best of every dish.  They really nail it.  My wife and I love the Thai steak and noodle salad, Formerly the Evil Jungle Princess. Awesome salad with a great cut of filet.They have also started serving a couple sushi roles...really tasty!  We loved the Thai Tuna. We always feel so relaxed and the food never makes us feel bad. It's dressy yet casual and anyone would have a great time there! Call ahead seating is nice on the weekends. Have fun!"}
{"text":"Food excellent, but has gotten way too pricey.
We have been going to Houston's for years and have loved it. Went last night and was shocked at the prices! $19.95 for a French dip sandwich is crazy!! The cheapest glass of wine was$11.00. They have even stopped selling soft drinks from the fountain (you get small bottles), in order to prevent refills.
I went to pay with a American Express gift card and was told that they add an automatic 20% fee for gift card redemption!
Yikes, what is happening to a former favorite restaurant of ours!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at various Houston's branches many times over the last 20 years, in many cities, and the best thing I can say about it is that it is very predictable.  It's a chain restaurant that lies in between the 1st tier chains (e.g., Arnie Morton's) and the 3rd tier chains (Chili's).

Food - Fine, if somewhat boring
Decor - Corporate posh; comfortable but bland
Service - Excellent, well trained staff
Value - Not so good.  Dinner will set you back $100, easily, without wine.  Wine in particular is extremely over-priced here.

Back in the day, they were a much better value.  At $25 to $30 for nearly every entrée, it's not such a great deal.  There is almost always a better choice nearby from my experience.

In short, a great place to take someone unadventurous who is more comfortable at a chain restaurant than an owner-operated place, which is why it's so popular for corporate type lunches and travelers I guess.

It's fine for corporate events, but when I'm spending my own money, I'd much rather eat at Ruth's Chris or Arnie Morton's, which are only slightly more expensive but much nicer."}
{"text":"I went to  Houston's on Saturday and our waitress was incredibly rude. I was with my aunt who is 92 and she kept bumping into her when she was try to get ip from the table.  Food was ok but service was bad i would not recommend someone to go there"}
{"text":"Today I decided to treat my sister and her fiancé to dinner tonight for treating me so well since I moved to Arizona from Hawaii. I asked my sister to make reservations at her favorite restaurant and she decided on Houston's. She was raving about their Hawaiian Rib-eye that she always orders from them. She was excited to take me here bc she loves food just as much as I do (especially a good filet steak). We arrived five minutes early for our reservation and the hostess asked if we were a party of three and my sister replied yes. The hostess then responded that it will be about a 15 minute wait. My sister then told her we had a reservation here, after I said \"Wait, don't we have a reservation?\". My sister assumed that they recognized her bc she comes here that often. We got seated right away and the night started off right. The ambiance is really nice and we got asked for beverages pretty quickly. We ordered as soon as we got our beverages bc we already knew what we wanted. We ordered the Home Smoked Salmon, Hawaiian Ribeye (for my sister and her fiancé to share bc they are on a 'diet'), side of Seasonal Veggies, USDA Prime Center-Cut Filet, and 2 beers. I ordered my filet to be Medium RARE. The smoked salmon came out first and It was OK but my sister loved it. Next our entrees came out... the top of my steak was pretty BLACK. When I cut in to the steak I already knew it was bad. It cut like how you think a thick beef jerky might cut. But I thought maybe the taste will make up for it... I was wrong! The steak tasted like beef charcoal. I then asked my sister and the fiancé to try it, thinking maybe I was going crazy. But they agreed that the steak was charred. My sister insisted that I tell our waitress, but I didn't have the heart to. Next thing I knew she flagged our waitress down and told her the situation. She agreed that the steak was over cooked but also mentioned that all their steaks were normally charred. I do not believe that anybody would eat a steak that taste like that! She apologized and said she will bring a new one right out. She took my plate away plus my utensils and I had to sit there watching them eat their food. I didn't have utensils to even take a bite of what they had. My sister offered a bite so I took one off her fork. But they were sharing a plate so I didn't want to eat the little they had. My plate FINALLY came after they already finished their plate. The manager (I assumed he was bc he was wearing a suit) put the plate down and apologized again and asked me to cut through the steak to make sure it was to my liking. He was awkwardly hovering so I felt rushed to roll-out my new utensils out of my napkin and felt rushed to cut through it. I have to say the steak was prepared much better. So I sat there eating my plate ALONE for the next 15 minutes. It was a really undesirable experience. Instead of having normal family conversations, it became more about the restaurant and the steak. We all agreed that for a higher-end restaurant such as Houston's we would expect something to be on the house. But we got our bill and everything was there. Nothing was comped, not even the side seasonal veggies. They did nothing to make up for it. I told my sister that I was disappointed on her choice of restaurant and now she is a little upset even though I was the one who got the short end of the stick. I still gave her a 15% tip bc it wasn't her fault for my piece of charcoal. My sister is going to have to rethink her favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Our favorite date night restaurant. Flemings ambiance with cheaper prices! The spinach artichoke dip is TO DIE FOR. Make a reservation, as it is usually packed. So impressed with their wait staff as they work together and food is always out in a timely manner. I've eaten many entrees from here and never had any complaints! Great food, great lighting, my favorite!"}
{"text":"I've been here many of times but i was surprised that I haven't been here for a long time. So it was time to check out all my Yelp friends reviews to see whats recommended. The place is dark but elegant in its own way. 

We started off with the Spinach & Artichoke dip. The tortilla chips were nice and crispy. It came with a warm spinach and artichoke dip, salsa, and sour cream. Oh my goodness, the warm dip was so good. Out standing. We were licking every drop of it. We even got another bowl of chips to finish everything off. 

I ordered the famous French dip sandwich. When I first ordered it, it doesn't sound too exciting but wow. Thinly cut prime rib with this really soft bread and dipping it the sauce made it outstanding. It was like melt in your mouth goodness. 

My wife and son ordered their go to dish of a full rack of baby back ribs. They are fall off goodness. The BBQ sauce is sweet and tangy. Really like these ribs. The sauce really makes it so good. They had cole slaw to and it was good and goes so well with the ribs. Nice and creamy. I shared with my wife and it was so good. 

The service was good. Usually it's outstanding but today we ordered our appetizer and needed a few minutes to order but it seemed like she got lost and took awhile to get back to us. That was the only negative but our water cups were bought to us very quickly. Refilled regularly and took our dirty plates on a timely manner. 

Loved coming here. Great food,  good service, and a really nice ambience. We'll be back again but not to long like last time. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Dined at Houston's Restaurant yesterday - lunch meeting. We were seated at a booth and our server was excellent. I ordered the salmon which was perfect! My side was broccoli and it was cooked perfectly. 

The restaurant was busy we were seated right away. I do know that this restaurant gets really busy during the evenings up to an hour + wait so get here early.

This location has always been busy which means great food an great service. If you're looking for a good steak/fish - check them out."}
{"text":"Excellent food great service really romantic atmosphere a great place to take a date excellent excellent food specially the prime rib"}
{"text":"This was our first experience at Houston's. The food was delicious, and the service was excellent. Our server, Tyler, was very attentive. 

We were sad they had run out of the grilled artichokes, but the menu said they were limited. The double cut pork tenderloin was amazing and the campfire ribeye was superb. I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good food.  Good service.  Bad location.  Bad hoodlums in the strip mall where it is located."}
{"text":"Had the baby back ribs when I received them they were cold so they apologized and replace it with ones that were hit and wow I would recommend getting them just wish I could have enjoyed my meal with me wife. I would also recommend getting the hot fudge sundae you won't regret it the Hot fudge is outstanding."}
{"text":"Consistency is key.  This is the best steakhouse in Scottsdale.  It is close to where we live and you always know what you are going to get after you order."}
{"text":"Praying that this isn't a trend with this location. We went in tonight for a 6pm reservation and were not seated until 6:15. No one apologized for the wait just sat us and walked away. Drinks took abnormally long to come out and refills were slow to be completed. Food order was taken and I asked that my steak be seasoned with Cajun season before it's cooked. The server said they were not able to do it, which I found odd since it was done for us three months ago. I asked that an inquiry be made with the Chef. The server returned and said they can bring it to me on the side but not season it with it. Anyone who has ever cooked a steak knows you have to season it before the cook. 
At any rate our food comes out around 20 minutes later. After about 12 minutes we flagged a manager down to get refills and missing condiments. He returned seconds later dropped off the refills and just walked away without asking if we needed anything else. Like a replacement potato since the ones we received were cold or to check on the steaks that were somehow overcooked and cold at the same time. Another 20 minutes later the server appeared and asked about desserts. In my head all I can think is how about how was dinner, an apology for not checking on us! 
At any rate overall this was a miss, and severely disappointing seeing as this is one of our favorite place."}
{"text":"Great food but I told the hostess it was my husbands birthday, she tells him happy birthday and never told our server!"}
{"text":"Awesome Ribs!  And spinach dip Appetizer is notable.  Pork chop was tasty as well.  Great service. Well worth the wait time to be seated.  Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"what an amazing experience!
we stopped by there on a short trip we had to scottsdale & thought let's check this place out! has a very nice interior design!
to our surprise (becuase of the expensive looking ambiance), the prices were really reasonable! around cheesecake factory..
our server Chris, was amazing..! very knowledgable, professional & friendly enough. was there whenever we wanted him to be, and was not there when we wanted to be left alone!!
if i go back there, will certainly check the place out again & ask for Chris."}
{"text":"I have friends that absolutely love Houston's.  In fact, they love this place soooo much that the staff knows them by name and they're usually having lunch there at least three times a week. 
I'm not one of them. 
I just don't see what the hype surrounding this joint is all about.  I'm sure it must be because I'm a vegetarian and they definitely aren't a veggie friendly establishment, but I've given it more chances than I should have.
The menu is just filled with a lot of meaty items that are hard to modify for a vegetarian, so that makes finding a meal that I'll really enjoy pretty tough.  
For an appetizer though, the spinach dip is really good, just make sure you ask for bread with it instead of chips. 
The prices are okay, but it definitely is a happening spot for both lunch and dinner pretty much any day of the week.  But as for me, I go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Houstons is always a great experience from the great service to the delicious and diverse menu.  However we each ordered a Diet Coke and instead of serving it in a glass fountain style it arrived at the table in an 8 ounce bottle and doesn't include a refill. This restaurant has made a mistake with this change."}
{"text":"Of course this restaurant deserves 5 stars as they are consistently exceptional. I have been dining there for many years, and I have never had a bad meal. I recently moved to the bar area for some last minute dinners and the bartender i think his name is Bret/Brad from Missouri is one of the most courteous and attentive employees i've seen there, or anywhere! My hat goes off to Houston's superb concept."}
{"text":"Houston's has always been a staple in Phoenix for me.  It's my mom's fave restaurant so we went there a lot growing up.  I just went there for the first time in a while last week and got a delish meal -- we split the spinach dip which comes with tortilla chips, salsa and sour cream and is amazing.  My mom got her chicken tortilla salad with lime vinaigrette and I got the salmon and asked for the couscous on the side (which is delish and a little sweet with raisins in it).  They have an amazing wine selection which the bartender told me many come from local AZ wineries.  We opted for cranberry/vodkas and grapefruit/vodkas -- the grapefruit juice is fresh."}
{"text":"This is the best and most consistant restaurant, I can't wait to come every year during spring training.
There are 2 appetizers that I get every year, the artichoke dip and the smoked salmon.  Very tasty.  The Hawaiian rib eye is to die for!  We have tried and tried to replicate it and have not had any success.
The one drawback this year was the waiter.  I felt like he was trying to turn the table and I felt rushed.  He kept grabbing the plates before we were done and didn't ask if we wanted to take the leftovers home.  A little rude, but did not dimish the overall experience due to the food.  We were seated by the \"entertainment\" and it was a little hard to talk, but they weren't bad."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a special occasion. Started with the spinach artichoke dip very good. Moved on to the pork ribs that were cooked great. Wasn't my favorite coleslaw but everything else great. Will be back."}
{"text":"A little disappointed because I heard so many great things about this place. VERY limited selection on the menu. I can even find an appetizer/entree with shrimp. I had the seabass which was good. My friend had the ribs which was good. The side veggie was actually the best thing on my plate. It's overall a OK restaurant. I had much better food in Hillstone. However, I like our waiter who was very nice and attentive. Also, I wonder how is it only a 2 $$. It should at least be a $$$ restaurant."}
{"text":"Houston's is always consistent. Always a wait, always good service, always good food.
It's worth the wait for the delicious housemade *Veggie Burger* with a soy glaze. It's out of this world. I also love their *coleslaw*. It's housemade and has a good amount of green onion and it's not soaked in mayonnaise. 
They have baked potatoes the size of your head. Mmm, always perfectly cooked.
My husband loves their *Ribs*"}
{"text":"This is by far the best menu, food, service, and atmosphere, at a modern american restaurant. It comes from the developers behind Hillstone and Banderas and is an upscale option for salads, sandwiches, steaks, fish and ribs.  

The food here is top notch. When artichokes are in season, they are on the MUST ORDER list--wood fired and juicy with an amazing remoulade dipping sauce. Another great option for an appetizer is the spinach dip--mouthwatering!

For entrees I highly recommend the French Dip which is the best I've tried anywhere, the salmon (it comes medium rare so make sure to specify if you like it cooked more), and the ribs which are fall-off-the-bone wonderfulness!!!! They also have my favorite salad in the world, though it is not on the menu, you can still order it.  The Club Salad has the most amazing tempura chicken, avocado, tomato, spring greens and your choice of dressing (go for the blue cheese).

You must get dessert at least once--you may think I'm crazy for suggesting something as simple as the hot fudge sundae. But you will leave with a newfound respect for the simple sundae after trying a sundae at Houston's."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the prices are high. The veggie burger is unique.  It has a rice base which creates an interesting consistency. My girlfriend sent it back. The ribs were great.  The fries are amazing. the customer service is also very good."}
{"text":"We came in for my dad's birthday and the food was excellent (for the most part). We had the shrimp cocktail appetizer, which was just ok. My dad ordered the olives as well, but they never arrived. For dinner, my dad had the ribeye which was juicy and subtly flavored with a Hawaiian pineapple glaze. I ordered the pork filet which was a little salty, but still delicious. It's rare to find pork filet and I'm glad I ordered it. I subbed the mashed potatoes for the baked potato and it was great. The braised red cabbage is also delicious. We topped off the night with a hot fudge sundae which was THE BEST HOT FUDGE SUNDAE I've ever had. Get it! Lastly, great margaritas!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this Houstons since 1996. I have never had a bad meal or poor service, never. It is always consistent and great service. The spinach dip and tortilla soup ROCK!  All of the food is simply delicious and ambience is just right. It is true they are getting kind of pricey so I don't go there 4 to 5 times a week anymore :( too bad. My favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"The flavor and richness of the food is phenomenal. I've had great experiences with the crispy chicken sandwich, oven-roasted chicken and famous French dip. The French dip is my go-to and is the best one I've ever had... by miles."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Houston's for over 25 years. It was my favorite restaurant. Today was a disaster. I ordered the Hickory burger. I ordered it medium well, when it arrived it was bloody. Then I noticed that the Canadian bacon had been replaced with some limp fatty bacon.  I would never quibble about paying 15 dollars, because it was that good.  There was a very small serving of limp greasy fries.  What happened? Is Houston's trying to save a few pennies on my burger?
I would rather spend $16 on a quality burger. That is why I have been so loyal to Houstons.  Now let me move on to the service. I feel like I walked into a different restaurant. I waited 10 minutes with an empty glass before I had to flag down whoever I could find.  After I received the disappointing burger, I asked if I could exchange it for the French dip. They obliged and of course upped my charge to $19.  French dip had also changed, now they have gone with a piece of french  bread as opposed to the prior oversized croissant.  Not sure I am coming back.  Such a sad day for me."}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks. Ordered the Thai stead salad and fall off the bone ribs. Perfect in every way! The food melts in your mouth with burst of flavor of every bite. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Houston's has been one of my all time favorite restaurants for a number of reasons.  It's not just the amazingly consistently delicious food they run out of their open clean kitchen.  It's the ambiance... the artwork, the live jazz bands, the fireplace, the candles, the beautiful wood that remains timeless and not to mention the smell of a wood burning oven.  It's nice to get out of the blazing sun and retreat to a cool place where it's relaxing atmosphere and excellent food welcomes you back, as you are greeted at the door by a smiling face.  Houston's seems to have a wonderful waitstaff that is extremely professional and attentive.  I have been to this locations several times and thought it was time I finally review it.  Since 2007 is when my love for Houston's developed.  I find their waitstaff is wonderful and provide the best consistent service through out the years.  AMAZING!!  

Now let's talk food!!  One of my favorites is the Famous French dip.  Now I have also watched the price of this delicious sandwich go up and up through the years.  It's still worth it!!  Especially if you look at it as a special sandwich not one you'd want to eat every other day.  The special being, the tender rare perfectly seasoned prime rib sliced thin served on a delicious buttery, shiny,  french roll with au jus.  I love the horseradish with it!!  I love their french fries or the loaded baked potato.   Since I have been to Houston's many times over the years I have many favorites.  I love the Spinach artichoke dip. The grilled Artichokes, so great.  I have also had their smoked salmon-which is, smoked in house (I'm  told).  It's the best damn salmon ever!!   I will sometimes just order it as a meal. The variety of salads with fresh produce and combinations of exotic ingredients makes for great lunch.  Pick one, they are all amazing.  As of lately, I have tried a new sandwich they put on their menu called Ding's Crispy Chicken sandwich.  It was the BEST!!!  The coleslaw on the sandwich makes it cool and crunchy fresh.  The bun once again is just buttery and delicious.  It also is a nice size sandwich. Their burgers are great as well.  My boyfriend says they are one of the best, cooking it perfectly juicy. The flying Chicken and the BBQ pork ribs are some of my favorites.  The fish dishes are always fresh tasting including their fish sandwiches that are done to flaky perfection.  Their sauces are also great...house made and well seasoned, the green goddess sauce, the spicy garlic aioli to dip fries in are just the perfect compliment to the quality of food that's being dipped. Houston's has it covered all the way around.  That's what makes it a great place!!  They have paid attention to the smallest details that making dining a pleasure with them. Right down to the clean and modern restrooms they have exceeded all expectations.

I usually am to stuffed to enjoy their delicious desserts... however, I have had their apple walnut cobbler. It's seasonal.. in the fall.  It's truly a taste of fall. Just try it!!!   The key lime pie is really wonderful as well.  The coffee is the best in town.  The smell of it through out the restaurant is enough to make me order every time.  Houston's crosses it's T and dots it's I's in the restaurant/culinary world with every thing they do!!!  Thank you for your fabulous service and constant attention to detail, it shows!!!  I can't wait to come back again!!"}
{"text":"Again, for a chain this is an outstanding destination.

I have NEVER been let down here. Always amazing food and excellent service, which is astonishing being that I live next door and have been here frequently.

I have always loved Houston's best for lunch. Also, check out their sister establishment \"Bandera\" in Old Town."}
{"text":"Been eating dinner here off and on for a decade plus,one of the most consistently delicious and friendly restaurants in the Valley. An off menu favorite is the Flying chicken platter, also the veggie burger is delightful. I come for the dark Chicago style steakhouse setting and jazzy evening ambiance. 

My favorite recommendation for intimate dinners - 4.95 Stars!"}
{"text":"Houston's went above and beyond for my first visit to their restaurant for a very surprising visit during Mother's Day weekend. My mom and her boyfriend are HUGE fans of Houston's, especially their martinis and the Hawaiian steak. So when it came time to select a location for my brother to surprise our mom for Mother's Day (he flew in from across the country), it was Houston's, selected by her boyfriend. 

So once I picked up my brother from Sky Harbor and we stepped inside, the sweet hostesses knew who we were and guided us to the table. Unfortunately it was dark outside and Houston's is dimly lit, so the effect wasn't all there. But.... she was absolutely floored and speechless, and the meal started off to a great weekend. Of course I got one of the martinis and was blown away by how great it was. The staff were kind to refill our spin dip because my brother and I were starving once we arrived. The three of them ordered the Hawaiian steak (and luckily for me I got their leftovers). My salmon was buttery and cooked to perfection, along with the sides that came with. 

I can't be more thankful for the amazing dining experience we had at Houston's, and I look forward to returning again in the near future."}
{"text":"Hands down...best date night spot! Cozy and intimate atmosphere. Fabulous and attentive staff. The food never disappoints! Definitely one of my Go-To places to eat!"}
{"text":"My wife calls Houston's her cafeteria, but to me it is a rip off.  With drinks we spent about $90 on two sandwiches, salads and an appetizer.  The veggie burger I got - recommended by our server - was flavorless and fell apart in my hands.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing?  Didn't spend enough money?

My wife had some sort of grilled fish sandwich and she enjoyed it.  raved about the delicious fish and the sample she shared - grudgingly - was well cooked and seasoned. 

Decent ambience, the decor is comforting, rich and fairly dark.  The lighting level is just about perfect.  A lot of places can't seem to nail that.  Crowded with happy diners, so maybe I am the outlier without the smile on the face.

We were seated fairly soon and I thought the hostesses did a good job keeping up with us as we moved around the bar before finding a place to light briefly with our adult beverages.

But, $90, for what?!"}
{"text":"Tried to make a rsvp for 5 people.  They don't accept parties of 5.  Seriously!  Never in my life have I heard of a restaurant not accomodating 5 people.  I can only speculate why but I'm suspect greed has something to do with it.  I won't be go back."}
{"text":"We were visiting Scottsdale and saw the fire pits going thinking we could sit outside  , not the case it's just a waiting area, but that's the only negative , my wife had the chicken , and she's saying it's the best she has ever had , I tasted it  and admit it was super moist and tasty ,  I had the tortilla soup which was delicious , and then I had the tenderloin Thai salad , OMG it was amazing. The flavors from a  salad are unbelievable 
 Last thing to say about the place is the drinks are great and out server was wonderful. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Houston's we got a problem!!! What happened to this place.  In days past the menu was plentiful, the food was great and prices were reasonable.  This no longer exists.  I don't know how on earth this place can survive.  The food was terrible, some too cold, some just plain old bad! The wait staff to interested in turning a table, when in fact it wasn't even crowded, literally interupted a conversation taking place between two of my guests to ask if we wanted dessert. Have you no home training???

Frankly if I could give no stars I would do that.  Wake up a smell the competition or you will be out of business in the blink of an eye."}
{"text":"Eat lunch there every Sun..Ordered French Dip with FF.. Sandwich came, FF ice cold. Sent back. By time replacement came, sandwich almost finished. Manager came by later & said something like \"sorry about that\". I'm a believer in what Oscar Wilde once said-\"I'm a believer in only the very best\". No heat lamps to keep food hot-hot food saved on cold plates? $21.00, plus tax & tip. Why do we continue to put up with this? It's beyond me. The place is always packed."}
{"text":"Great service. Drinks great. Wish they had more food options though. I had the rotisserie chicken. It was fine"}
{"text":"Was very very upset and insulted leaving this restaurant tonight. I am wearing a designer turtle neck sweater top and was told they were a very conservative restaurant and was asked if I had something to cover up my well thought out outfit for the evening on a Valentine's date with my fiancé. Since I did not we left promptly as we no longer felt comfortable and we will not be coming back here. You should start offering uniforms at your restaurant for the customers. Disgraceful."}
{"text":"We just had our whole meal comped by Houston's... we were shocked and pleasantly surprised. They mentioned the food took long to come out so they covered the whole meal. WHAT A PLACE!!!!"}
{"text":"Got me usually good food.Placed was packed.Steak was average and French fries cold.Service was fine."}
{"text":"After flying into Phoenix, getting to the car rentals, and then driving to Scottsdale to check into our hotel... this place is a gold mine!

Decor - it's super super dark in there, kind of a romantic ambiance almost. Too bad I came here with coworkers. Just kidding. Anyway, it's pretty nicely decorated. A little bit of classic and the lanterns add a contemporary feel to it. Very very pretty. 

Food - We started off with the grilled artichoke. Bit on the salty side, but pretty good nonetheless. I've never actually grilled one before. Main dish was the salmon. SO BUTTERY AND MOIST. Oh my. Everything about it is great. Tried a rib from a coworker. They fall off of the bone. Delicious. We ended with the cobbler. More buttery goodness. 

Service - our waitress was amazing. Sweet and attentive. 

I had a great experience. If i'm ever back in the area, I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Another fantastic experience at Houston's. Service is outstanding along with the atmosphere and food! My gosh, even the simple dinner salad was phenomenal. Slightly pricey but worth every penny!"}
{"text":"The Hostesses has a terrible attitude, and are a bad representation of the fine quality that the Houston's brand represents !"}
{"text":"Houston's is fading!  I'm from out of town and always Looked forward to eating here.  All the little things that made this place great are slowly going away.  The Cheese bread, the Chicken Tenders appetizer.  Seemed like we waited a long time for our dinner to arrive.  Water glasses were more empty than full.  Sorry Houston's I won't drive across town in the future!"}
{"text":"Houstons is one of my favorite restaurants but it was such a disappointment tonight. I came here with my family and ordered a salad with chicken and when it came out the chicken was fatty. The manager came by and apologized and they brought out a fresh one which was nice. Once I started eating it I noticed that the chicken was raw and bloody. After showing the waitress she didn't apologize and the manager never came over. They removed it from the check but still for my favorite restaurant to be so unprofessional about this situation left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"My favorite place to celebrate my birthday!! Delicious Hickory burger and those Chicken Tenders!"}
{"text":"Decided we were going to eat at Houston's for 4th of July after we were informed by the Prado Restaurant that they required a reservation, or it would be one hour and thirty minute wait.  Happy to report Houston's was able to handle a big crowd on a holiday and they got us seated within 10 minutes.  I had the grilled halibut sandwich and string fries, my husband had the rotisserie chicken and baked potato.  Both were very delicious and staff as always was great."}
{"text":"Thai steak noodle salad. This is the only entree I've ordered for the past 15 years. Lol. 
The spinach artichoke dip is my go to appetizer 
and we tried the smoked salmon appetizer this time around and it was delish. The smoked salmon is a cold smoked salmon. It was Smokey and delicious with the spread it comes with. 
It had been at least 5 years since I last ate a Houston's but I just loved how the first bite of the spinach artichoke dip and the first bite of my salad, brought me way back to exactly how I remember it. Glad to see they haven't changed their recipes. Service was great as always."}
{"text":"Ok. So my wife and I eat at Houston's several times a month. I always have the cheeseburger done medium well (no overcooked jokes please). Last night we took our friends for dinner and drinks and I have to say it was disappointing from the start. 

First, while waiting for a table we decided to begin what we thought would be our first of MANY margaritas, however, that didn't pan out because these were not the delicious frothy drinks we are so used to; instead, they were very strong (I know, why am I complaining about that?) but it wasn't like a 'too much tequila' strong, it was more like 'someone didn't make the mix right and the wrong flavors are coming out' strong. We switched our drinks and that was that.

Later, while seated at our table and as we waited for our food to arrive the waitress brought by a margarita made with a new (I suppose) batch of mix and..... yes! This one was done right so we ordered a few more.

So finally our food arrives. I am almost done eating the first half of my burger and then realize that the meat is very undercooked. I try to brave it and not complain again so I shove the last piece of that half's burger in my mouth and reluctantly swallow it. As I'm done chewing, the waitress stops by and I take the opportunity to show her my second half which is also undercooked. She agreed and said she will have it fixed. 

Now I want to make something clear. I don't eat super pink/red meat for two reasons: 1. to me, it's gross and 2. I have Crohn's and have flared up from it before.

Anyway, along comes the manager, very apologetic, and puts in front of me A HALF OF A CHEESEBURGER! Yes, i assume it was the cheeseburger they took to finish cooking! My friends, my wife and I were in awe! We could not believe that 1. They took my burger apart, cooked the half of the cheeseburger, cut up HALF A BUN and added HALF THE CHEESE and HALF THE TOPPINGS and brought it to me!! 2. Lest I repeat they TOOK THE MEAT OFF MY PLATE, cooked it on the same grill where other people's food was being cooked and brought it back - how did they know I didn't lick it or spit on it? 3. This, from what Bon Appetit magazine called \"The Best Run Restaurant in the Country\"!

Wow! We were dumbfounded that Houston's wouldn't just replace it with a fresh new burger. I should mention they DID bring extra asparagus on the house.

Now, Houston's - or any restaurant for that matter, should appreciate feedback from customers like us. We are there many times each month and therefore, we know what to expect in terms of service and quality - this time, it was not up to par. Unfortunately, over the last few times it has not been up to par with things going wrong here and there. Sure everyone makes mistakes, but lately the mistakes have become more and more instead of less and this is why I can't, as much as I'd like to, give them 5 stars. 

One last thing - a tip more so: when you ask for ketchup, make sure you ask them to \"fill it up\" otherwise they will bring you a half full container which won't be enough for your fries and I which think is so petty like maybe make more if you think you're gonna run out. Smh."}
{"text":"The Beautiful Carin and I went to dinner with one of my business partners and his wife tonight.
They suggested Houston's, and my first thought was \"no\", but you know what? I'm glad we went there for dinner.
I may have eaten at nearly every Houston's in North America over the past 15 years, and sometimes it just seems a little bit repetitious...it's the same menu in Minneapolis, Charlotte, Milwaukee, and Left Overshoe, Nebraska. But...I think that's the genius of it!
I like their French Dip sandwich, I like their burgers, I like their ribs, I like their soups and salads, I like they way they pour a cocktail (perfect vodka martini tonight, BTW...ice cold...like a comforting fog made of vodka...mmmmm...vodka).
Anyway, I realized that I like pretty much everything I've ever had at Houston's and that I can get pretty much everything I've ever had at A Houston's at THIS Houston's! Genius!
The service is attentive and now that they take ressie's, the lengthy wait for a spot in the restaurant can be a thing of the past.
I do have one small quibble with the service (and it really is a quibble). I just don't really like being interrupted during my second bite to be asked \"is everything wonderful?\" It's just kind of presumptuous to ask the \"wonderful\" part, in the first place, and the wonder doesn't really kick in until I've had a few more bites...then I will be happy to let you know it was wonderful! As I say, just a quibble...they were just trying to be sure we were happy...and we were!
Finally, a word about sushi at Houston's...the word is \"really?\" I love sushi, but this may be the only thing on Houston's menu that I have not tried. I just think it's reaching. When I walk into a Houston's, \"raw\" and \"fish\" aren't top of mind. But, more sushi for you guys!
All in all, Houston's (all the millions and millions of locations, but esp. you, local Scottsdale location) is a solid lunch and dinner spot. It won't cost you and arm and a leg for a really decent meal in a nice relaxing atmosphere. It may not be the greatest grub you'll ever have, but it's pretty damn good! Thanks for getting me out there tonight, partner!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably good food and service. We will definitely return. My husbands pork chop was the thickest and best flavored ever."}
{"text":"Great bar servers . Delicious food. Very busy place with great fresh drinks so very delicious. Got the French Dip so yummy. Love this place. Got the last bar seat"}
{"text":"I love the Hawaiian ribeye, so amazing!!!

Usually they have a long wait but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"The best filet mignon and prime rib. Great atmosphere and awesome service.
The something green that comes with the filet is a really nice salad. I always enjoy this place. Sometimes there a bit of a wait but it's because the food is so good."}
{"text":"So Att: All vacationers, if you are golfer or ball player and you want to spend $150 for lunch beware! You cannot sit down and eat peacefully without the \"Hat\" cops asking you 20 times to take off your hat. It's one thing for your personal server which is fine, but people who are just  'y to ask was annoying! Prob last time eating here after 20 year's of being a loyal customer. If it was such a big deal, then they should have enforced this policy when greeted or before we drove 45min to get here.  Our server Liz R and Demetri were professional.. sounds like a COORP issue!!"}
{"text":"This place deserves all of the stars and much much more!
I love the hillstone group and all of its restaurants. I first stepped into a Houston's in 1998 (ya, I'm aging myself)!
Everything here is phenomenal! From all their appetizers and dinner plates I have been extremely happy with each and every order. Service here is immaculate and on point.
I will always come back and bring friends here for an outstanding good time."}
{"text":"Hadn't been in awhile, no particular reason, but lunch today with an old friend was enjoyable.
Attentive service, prompt food delivery, complete and better than ever, I  will be back, soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. My favorite is chicken tender salad but truly everything on the Menu is amazing. My husband loves Ribs so he always gets the Ribs. If you want bread and butter you have to ask for it and I believe they charge $1.00 which is silly. Anyways, service is always excellent. This place is always busy for lunch or dinner. Maybe make a reservation."}
{"text":"I've always loved Houston's because no matter which location you go to it is consistent and the service is top notch. Never do you find yourself desperately straining your neck looking for your server and I love that!   I am a huge fan of the Cheeseburger, spinach dip, veg plate, and if you like ribs there's are the best....oh I almost forgot salads, I have tried every single one and they are all Fantastic! So, if you want to get your money's worth on a great meal, great ambiance, and phenomenal service Houston's is your place!"}
{"text":"Not too shabby. I love the atmosphere here and the food is typically pretty good. I've only really had one bad meal here, and they were extremely apologetic and immediately removed it from our bill. Love the dark atmosphere... It makes me feel like a mobster. Win."}
{"text":"The food is great!  I usually get the 96 Hour Marinated Hawaiian Rib-Eye, Fully Loaded Baked Potato and side Caesar salad.  Best steak of my life so far and I've had some pretty decent steaks!  

I've also had the burger for lunch and it's pretty good too.

Service is amazing... multiple servers are always looking out for your table.  

I just wish that there was a Houstons in San Diego."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved going to Houston's over the years.  We first discovered this restaurant when we lived in Orlando.  Then, over the years as we've moved around we have always gone if there was one near us.  In Saratoga, it went by the name of the Los Altos Grill.  Now that we live in Scottsdale we are thrilled there is one nearby again.  We have gone quite a few times since our move thus past August.  

Right now, they are having a fall menu with a side dish of Spaghetti squash with tomato chutney.  Normally I am not a big fan of spaghetti squash - however, I would eat this side dish as a main menu item every day of the week!  I absolutely love it.  Their steaks are awesome and my husband eats their ribs every time we go.  So those things are still fantastic.  

If I could get the recipe for this spaghetti squash dish I would be so so very happy!  

So go if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Outstanding smoked salmon appetizer, wonderful ribs, prime rib, and fillet.
Outstanding service, but rather high prices and nothing special offered for our birthday celebration."}
{"text":"French dip or Thai Noodle Salad every time. i hear their shrimp cocktail is the best around."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. When we first arrived we didn't have to wait to be seated and we didn't have a reservation. The service was impeccable. They constantly refill your water glass and are very attentive.  The steak and rotisserie chicken hit the spot and the overall ambiance is really nice. I would love to come again."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Houstons once or twice a week for years and have NEVER had bad service and NEVER had a bad meal.   So for all those posing ONE STARS, I suggest you are full of it and if you don't have a great experience or food ask for the manager and you will get it sorted out and frankly comped.   I don't buy many of these reviews."}
{"text":"Best French Dip in town hands down. Good atmosphere with soft music (no loud blaring EDM) and dim lighting. Food is amazing but expect to spend some dough. Service is usually good too. Great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting the Houston's located on Camelback Rd. for years and decided to check out this one just a few days ago with my friend.

First of all, this place is no doubt a Houston's with its swanky, low-lit, dark cherry wood and leather decorated decor, plus the signature dinner clock always hung right above the kitchen windows. My friend and I we're sat in one of their plushy booths located in the raised section of the restaurant that kind of gives you a overlook of the entire joint, which is pretty neat.

Our waitress was fantabulous, she was accommodating to my friend's \"picky\" requests and she was quick with the ice tea refills (ref. King's Fish House review)! My Caesar salad and crispy shoe-string fries were spectacular and my friend enjoyed her Veggie burger minus the bun and God knows what else she asked for to be tweaked. We left here with full stomachs and slightly emptier wallets, but it was well worth it. 

I would definitely recommend this place for a nice lunch with the gal/guy pals to chat it up and have a decent meal or a few drinks."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate Valentine's Day. My hunny ordered the prime rib and I had the salmon. Both meals tasted good. Now I'm not usually one to complain, as I've worked in the industry, however when my meal arrived, the potatoes were served cold AND they had paper in them. I was given replacement potatoes and an apology. However, when you're spending well over $100 for a dinner for two we expect some sort of hospitality. We were highly disappointed with how Houstons handled the situation given the reputation of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice, dark and quiet. Good service. Great salads. Expensive, $15 for a hamburger with fries or a small salad. I want to try the steak salad. My friend ordered it and said she really enjoyed it. It had lots of medium welcome steak chunks with just a little gristle. Nick was our waiter. He was awesome! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Love Houston's but the location on Scottsdale Road is not my favorite. We all ordered Thai Chicken Salad. Dressing so strong we could not finish our salads. I have been dreaming about this salad..but at the downtown location. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Somehow Houston's clones its servers and ambiance across state lines with ease as I felt like I was in the Houston, TX location here. The food was spectacular as always and I must hype up the chicken tenders, which I order everytime I come to a Houston's. It is in a light tempura batter and the chicken itself is super moist and tender.. paired with a honey mustard dipping sauce and you have quite the duo. FYI, its not on the menu, but you can still order it.. its the best thing on their menu imo."}
{"text":"Let's be real, it's hard not to love Houston's! The quality of food and level of service is top notch here, hard to beat. Everyone is treated like a high end client. My real estate team and I love to frequent Houston's, often sitting at the bar. We meet many of our new clients here just by stopping in for lunch! 

Now on to the best part...what to order? EVERYTHING. But my favorite...drum roll please...is the kale salad! I know it doesn't sound as exciting as the prime rib sandwich or freshly caught wild salmon, but just order this and you will see why. The honey mustard peanut sauce is the best I've ever had. Wish I could recreate this at home, but then again I don't because I get too excited to come here and eat it! Thanks Houston's for always making my tummy happy! :)"}
{"text":"I have been going there since 1989, their salad is the best, spinach dish is still best, quality is same, but a big problem is a Quantity it has shrunk on grill chicken salad not happy .price has increase but quantity is less why chips less why i don't get it"}
{"text":"Amazing and unforgettable experience at Houston's in March! My fiancé & I are from Indiana, and we were only in town for a few days. We ended up getting engaged Saturday, March 26, and my friend who lives in Arizona arranged our engagement dinner to be here. Table for 2. We were running about 15 minutes late, yet they were still so very accommodating. The food was phenomenal, the service was absolutely amazing. They treated us so well after finding out what we were celebrating. I wish I remembered our servers name. He was a young guy, maybe early 30s. He took great care of us and really made the experience so rememberable! We will be back! :)"}
{"text":"One of our go-to places.  We eat here frequently and it's the best if you want consistently high service with outstanding food.  They get it right EVERY time.  I have probably been here 20 times and NEVER had to send something back.  Their Crab Cakes are INSANELY good (although seasonal.. so not always available).  Their prime rib is good, the chicken is great.  I also like their grilled artichoke appetizer.  It's amazing.  Awesome bartenders - so the drinks are perfect.  The staff work together SO cohesively - you would never know whether someone is covering your table or not, because EVERYONE offers to take care of whatever you need.  WE LOVE Houston's."}
{"text":"I have been coming here and all of their locations for 15 years. It is always an excellent experience and the food is excellent and very consistent even at different locations around the country. Great food at a fair price. Good friendly staff."}
{"text":"The Thai steak salad is delicious. Ask for the grilled artichoke appetizer.  Yumm!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely perfect. Everything from the service to the food to the timing of the bus girl was right on point.  For as busy as it was, everything was so prompt. I was looking forward to trying the grilled artichoke and was a little disappointed when they didn't have it and offered grilled Brussel sprouts instead, but it was delicious. For the main course, I had the Ruby Red Trout with broccoli and whipped potatoes. Everything was perfectly portioned. My boyfriend had the prime rib and I have to say, I don't even eat meat and it looked amazing. If I ever were in Scottsdale again I would come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"OK, I know I said never again, but I really wanted one of their baked potatoes - I figured, they can't mess up a baked potato - right?   My husband and I arrived just before 5pm, since they don't serve them until 5.  We sat at the bar as I did two years ago when I last tried eaging here.  I really didn't think I would ever eat here again due to the really poor experiences during my limited visits over the past few years.  News flash - you can mess up a baked potato.  Houston's, please make note of this.  

When our potatoes arrived, I was enjoying a truly lovely glass of ZD Chardonnay.  Our potatoes were nicely loaded, and accompanied by extra bacon and chives.  We dived in, prepared to be fully satisfied.  The potatoes never got good.  I couldn't figure out what was ruining the experience for awhile.  The toppings were as great as ever... It finally hit me as we drove home feeling less than satisfied.  The potatoes were extremely dry and grainy - there was none of the anticipated creaminess to the potatoes.  They were overcooked.  At 5pm, they were overcooked.  Even butter (which I don't usually have), sour cream and cheese couldn't fix overcooked.

Note to self, REALLY, never again.  Over the past few years, Houston's has been hit or miss for others as well.  This is not just me.  Sad since I literally used to eat here several times a week in spite of the expense.   Houston's used to have a great menu that they executed PERFECTLY - every single time.  I track the downward trend to the point at which they decided that it made sense to add sushi to their menu - something that they didn't do well at all.  The transition in Phoenix from Houston's to Hillstone, though subtle, left me with no interest in returning there after a few tries.  Banderas in Old Town Scottsdale lost its footing at about the same time in terms of long standing customers. 

REALLY, Never Again."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Houston's for several years and it was as good as we remembered. My husband and I shared the Kale salad which was delicious with warm rotisserie chicken and just the right amount of dressing to favor it but not too much that it was overwhelming. Our only disappointment was that it wasn't as large as the other chicken salad so not quite large enough to share especially when that is all you are having.  My mother had her all-time  favorite, the prime rib dip and she loved it, tender non-fatty prime rib on what seemed to be a pretzel roll and said it was better than the one she always orders at White Chocolate. The service was great very accommodating and eager to please.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Best damn salad I've ever had in my life. Based on that alone, I give Houston's 4 stars. Perhaps someday I'll venture back to sample their dinner menu."}
{"text":"The 'original'--end of sentence. All others don't come close (white chocolate, chelsie's, etc.) One of best, national chains. Update: burger (hickory) & salads (Thai steak) some of best in city. Restau- rant still looks great after 20+ yrs & service some of the best..."}
{"text":"Delicious and GREAT service. 

We had the hickory burger (Canadian bacon, cheddar, onions) and fries. They serve cokes in little glass bottles which I thought was a nice touch. The staff works as a team, so you are never waiting on a server or waitress. Good food, nice restaurant, great staff - definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious veggie burger and frites!  This reminds me of an old Chicago steakhouse from decades past, and some of the decor seems deliberately retro.  Good wine offerings here.  Prices are getting north, but it is a nice place in a nice area so no surprise."}
{"text":"O....M.....g... We just had the most amazing experience ever. First Father's Day at Houston's here in Scottsdale and went to go pay for the bill and the waiter says it was anonymously taken care of. Someone took care of our bill. Wow. I've been hearing about this 'Paying it Forward' thing going around but never would have expected it to happen to us. So cool. 

We had the ribs (always a hit and my favorite) and shared their amazingly simple yet delicious garden salads with a side of broccoli for the little one who loved it. As a joint Father's Day and my birthday dinner, it couldn't have been more perfect.

PS - thank you Jeff for taking such good care of us! Very attentive!"}
{"text":"What a terrible experience.  I love Houston's and there are very few restaurant chains that I can say that about.  I look forward to going to a Houston's any time I can.  We went into this one on a Friday evening, February 21st of this year.  It was later in the evening but we were just going to have a drink at the bar and perhaps a snack.  We walked in and the place was jumping.  Luckily there were a few seats available at the bar where we saw one of the bartenders JUST serving entrees as we arrived.  We were met by a female bartender (blonde) who stopped us in our tracks to say \"sorry we are closing and so longer serving\".  Again- the place was packed and people were still waiting for their dinners!  I know the difference between stopped seating vs stopped serving!  She was so fricking rude that it has stuck with me these past four months!  We explained we were just looking to have a drink and maybe a snack but couldn't even get the sentence out before she shut us down again.  Clearly she had after work plans or took a cranky pill but one this is clear- she should NOT be behind the bar at This or any other decent restaurant!  She has a very bright future down at the DMV however.  Thanks for trying to kill our evening Ms Sunshine!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants for dinner in Scottsdale. Seriously...this place is delicious.

Ribs are always good and the burger is a classic here.

This is a great restaurant for a date, or friends, or family. It can sometimes be a little loud though. Dark lit restaurant - perfect for a glass of wine and a meal."}
{"text":"I would rate this ten stars if i could, basically my favorite restaurant, great food, excellent quality ingredients, excellent service, its always good and if something slips through the cracks they make it right immediately. 

My favorites are the flying chicken platter (best chicken fingers you will ever have, baby back ribs, tune burger, french dip, trout, fish sandwich, really hared to have a bad meal here.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. The Hawaiian ribeye is worth the price. And the steak salad was just perfect- I can still taste the perfect balance of flavors. Yummmm! Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"I have never had a more delicious oriental chicken salad.  That salad alone is worth continued support of this restaurant. Yuuummmm"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and great atmosphere. Houston's has what I believe is some of the best prime rib in town. Also, try their smoked salmon."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in scottsdale. Solid burgers, unfortunately they stopped serving their sushi because that was my favorite thing on the menu. Beside that love the french dip. Also great service and nice setting"}
{"text":"What can you say about Hiustons, always first class service and quality food.

Love this location and generally will go after church on a Sunday afternoon.

Great spinach Dip with chips and salsa. Awesome burgers and fries but the main stay entrée for lunch I an the french dip sandwich.

Our entire family of four salivates when we talk about eating at Houstons and can't wait for the French Dip Sandwich.

Can't wait to come back again and again"}
{"text":"We had club salads with the honey lime vinaigrette and peanut sauce. Salad had crispy chicken on top. Was so good.  Server was excellent. I do recommend this restaurant and the club salad with crispy chicken."}
