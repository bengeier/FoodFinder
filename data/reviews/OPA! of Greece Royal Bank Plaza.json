{"text":"Not bad for a quick lunch.  At least the calamari was deep fried upon ordering and not sitting under a heat lamp.  A bit pricy though."}
{"text":"I like their breakfast! $7 for western breakfast + minute maid juice!!"}
{"text":"Fairly efficent place, food is okay. They cook in front of you so you know that it's a bit better than \"fast food\" but also slower. The calamari seems to be made fresh to order but the meat on a stick are pre made and heated on the grill. The staff are pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Yea. This place is garbage. Brown wilted lettuce, tiny skewers of meat, food clearly isn't fresh. They didn't bother giving me any dressing on my salad either? Wtf?! Don't bother going here and maybe try the Swiss Chalet down the way."}
{"text":"Watch out for this place. Got food poisoning from here a few months ago, sent a note to their head office through their website so it wouldn't happen to anyone else and expecting a profuse apology and I got no response. No question their operation is very poorly run and pretty sketchy"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  Really good Calamari, dusted as you order and fried right away. I usually get the Calamari salad...highly recomended!"}
