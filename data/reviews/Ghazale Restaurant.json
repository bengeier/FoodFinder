{"text":"Best veggie wrap I've ever had (the one with cauliflower and eggplant). Literally, the best cauliflower preparation I have ever tasted.   It takes true skill to make veggies this savory and the servers were incredibly friendly. Go to this place for cheap dinner on the go!"}
{"text":"I ordered a grapeleaf and chicken shawarma.  The grapeleaf was great.  I was dismayed to find the use of microwave ovens on almost everything, including my shawarma.  I've had numerous shawarmas here in Toronto, as well as Hamilton, Ottawa, as well as Al Khobar and Tabuk in Saudi Arabia.  No one used a microwave like this place, if at all.  In every other case, the meat would come off the spit right into your pita bread, not sit around to be microwaved afterwards.    It was rather flavourless as well.  Never again, especially with all the other shawarma places around."}
{"text":"Okay, the chicken (or beef) shawarma sucks. Used to be good ages ago, but not in the past few years. It's precut and sits in the steam table drying out. Don't order it.    On the other hand, the falafel is great. This is how the place wins awards (see the various weekly magazine yearly awards for proof.)   If you want meat, there's lots of nearby choices, but this is the best when the munchies say otherwise."}
{"text":"I've come here for a number of years and it has never disappointed me. I remember a while back, the chicken tasted dry. Now, the chicken is moist. I suggest trying out the chicken shawarma - filling and cheap kinda. I personally find their platters are quite small and expensive though. Nice place for a quick snack if you're strolling along Bloor street."}
{"text":"Sometimes I get lazy and on my way home from work.  When I don't feel like cooking so I hit up Ghazale.  This place is tiny.  When I say tiny, I mean my neighbour's washroom is about the same size.  There is seating for about three or four people max so the best option is take-out.  It's always busy, which is a good sign -- means the food turn-over is high.  I've never tried their shish-taouk or shawarmas but I get their meat in a container ($3-$6) and seperate from that I get several salads ($3-$6) and voila, a wonderful meal!  Try it!"}
{"text":"Anyone who regularly checks out movies or festivals at the Bloor is very familiar with the fare here, or at the very least the smell of it, which wafts gently over moviegoers as they stand in line, making everyone's hair and clothes smell just a touch like shawarma.  The best thing to order is a combo plate where you can pick and choose several of the myriad dishes they have on offer, temptingly hiding behind the glass.  I'm a big fan of just a regular falafel meal or a falafel sandwich, but the side dishes tend to be the main focus here, as well they should.  Since everything here is to go, they are generally quick and generous with the serving sides.  However, occasionally the line will get long (usually in the immediate hours following last call at the bars).  These moments seem interminable, but power through and you will be rewarded with delicious healthy, non pizza-pizza fare.  And that is worth more than a few minutes wait for sure."}
{"text":"Open late (til 300 last time I checked). Cheap. Tasty selection of veggie eats like giant beans and ciuscous. When I lived nearby and worked at a bar, this place was a life saver."}
{"text":"I've been to this location before and received friendly service, but atrocious and microwaved falafel (my husband had the shawarma jerky - LOL) ... oh well.  I thought I'd give it another try because I needed something in a hurry and the far superior Laila across the street takes their time making your food... what a mistake!  I asked for a small container of beans.  The person there made up a large container and charged me for it before I noticed it wasn't what I ordered.  She proceeded to argue with me and say she showed me the container (she didn't) before she filled it and it was now too late and she wasn't going to dump out half the beans and give me my money back.  The kicker was that she had charged me $5.99 for the large container when it clearly says on the menu that it's $4.99 - I pointed it out and she just didn't care.  Forget this place - terrible food, bad attitude.  Willing to lose business over a hill of beans!"}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma here is priced to a student's wallet and cooked to meet the scrutiny of a food critic. I have yet to be let down by the top-notch food this place has served me. Time and time again I come back and I am never disappointed by the super quick service and hot wraps. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Yeah, sometimes it's really dry, but 4/5 times it's awesome. Fresh, cheap, delicious, and open late! Total neighbourhood staple. If you're what you eat I'm at least 25% Ghazale. I love the chicken shawarma as a wrap, or as a plate. Of the sides, lima beans, tabbouleh, and the beet salad are awesome. Ask for tons of hummus and garlic sauce for complete bliss. Also they have funky beverages (fuck yes I'll take the sour cherry soda, thank you). Never close down or I'll cry."}
{"text":"I'm basing this review on the food and the outstanding customer service. I ordered catering for a class of 20 students. At the beginning, I was a bit confused when I called and a Rogers technician picked up. He passed the phone to one of the workers there and she directed me to the owner. I then called the owner and she was super-sweet with making suggestions. For just a few dollars more than what we usually order I ended up ordering one of their packages plus a few more items and the students could not be happier! We had beef and chicken shawarma, two different kinds of rice, taboule, cabbage salad, pita, hummus, and sauce.   The students have already asked when I'll be ordering from Ghazale for lunch again. Great service, great food, and great value!"}
{"text":"Yeah, indeed this place is nothing special. Tiny room with three seats. We just got hungry while it started to rain and always wanted to go there, so dropped in for a veggie platter. Two veggies, one salad, one rice what we got on our nearly $8 dollar plate, not much to share between two people aside from the other places we have visited and got full. Didn't happen in Ghazale, so small portions.  Food was good, tasty, but not mind-blowing. Was warmed not very warm in microwave. Lentil rice and mixed battered veggies taste the best. I think we just need to give another chance to the place in some other location."}
{"text":"I actually love Ghazale.  Four stars instead of five because of the microwave factor, but my food's always delicious and hot, and considering the volume of customers in there, quick. The seating arrangements are... 3 barstools at a small counter inside, and a bench outside (unless Hot Docs lineups are blocking it).  But there's a great parkette with benches and tables behind the building, so meh. The veggie samosas are super tasty (and affordable... 1.25, I think) and my absolute favourite hungry-girl meal is the chicken meat plate with choice of three other dishes.  I get the lentil rice, taboule & cabbage salad, and it's a satisfying, delicious meal every time.  They always offer me tahini and hot sauce - I've never been charged for that...  They also have daily specials... Monday chicken shawarmas are 3.99, Wednesdays beef shawarma for 3.99.  I think Falafel sandwiches are 2.99 on Tuesdays, but Sarah's by Brunswick wins the falafel title by a knockout.  Ghazale naysayers, I say, \"More for me!\""}
{"text":"This is the best chicken shwarma I've found IN THIS AREA. My main complaint is that they microwave the chicken in the pita before dressing it. I would much prefer fresh sliced chicken off the rotary chicken grill thing, but that's not their way. Still it's pretty good, not worth venturing far for, but if you're in the area and want quick middle eastern food I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"My fave Shawarma place. Chicken is perfectly seasoned and always fresh, have not been disappointed in the four years I have been coming here.  Love the freshly squeezed juice options (they also have a store front next door for these). Love that it is opened late and the staff are always nice."}
{"text":"Decent, cheap, dependable food. Their take-out containers are sturdy and can be reused as tupperware. Never had their meat dishes, but their veggie plate is a good, hefty amount of food for $7. Wish they didn't reheat the meal in the microwave, but that's the only negative I can for this place."}
{"text":"Super solid hole-in-the-wall. I've never had any of the meat options, but I can tell you that the salads are awesome. At about six dollars, the salad box, with choice of four salads, is a great deal. It's both healthy and filling. No more overpriced salad bars for me! The cabbage roll is also delicious, filling, and a great deal."}
{"text":"They were out of all the fruit/veg I asked for and on the menu. Smoothie was OK (although all the fruit was frozen) and it cost $5 (orange juice+strawberries+blueberries). Did not make me feel like a VIP."}
{"text":"I guess it depends on your expectations. I always order the vegetable sandwich which is a pita stuffed with cooked eggplant and potato (yes microwaved), and is quite substantial for less than $4 including tax. It is a very enjoyable sandwich with hot sauce+tahina+salad, and my friends seem to like the shawarma, though I have not tried at that location, only at the college/yonge one, which is very good. Avoid during peak times because there are only three seats within, but they will let you sit in the juice bar if it's full."}
{"text":"Comfort food on a cold night! Consistently delicious food. I always order the veggie plate to go, and usually opt for lentil rice, eggplant type stew, kale or lentil salad, and cauliflower type stew. Such delicious flavour all around- served with hummus and tahini. Also great price point- $9. Friendly staff when I've been there as well. :)"}
{"text":"Ghazale and I go waaaaaaay back. Mostly binge eating after drunken nights when I was a LOT younger. Haven't been in many years, and went in with the wife for lunch since we were right there.   I think the folks running it are nice and well meaning, but the place is not faring well (maybe it never was, but beer goggles made it better?). Its very cramped inside, with three stools, but they don't want you to eat at them, they request you go to their juice bar next door, carrying your tray outside, to eat there. Both places are quite dirty, and there are some communication issues (they gave us the wrong order when a few people were at the cash at the same time; we tried to explain it wasn't what we ordered and they didn't understand, kept saying it was the same, when the none of the food items were the same as we ordered).   Food quality isn't bad, but it isn't great either. You choose from a number of meat, veg and salad dishes to make a platter for a fixed price. The stewed beans and the veg stew were good. The chicken was dry and flavorless, but the rice and lentils were full of flavor. Didn't eat any salads, but they looked fresh. They were very stingy on the sauces (Toum is my fave thing), only giving me a scant teaspoon despite me saying I would pay extra. The samosas were......teerrrrrible. At least that day. Dry, rubbery, flavorless, and felt like they had been sitting there a long time.   $35+ for 2 small containers of food, 2 drinks and 2 samosas. Not break the bank, but you can definitely get much much better quantities and quality at better prices elsewhere. Last thing I'll say is I'm dumbfounded that they don't swap locations. Move the juice bar to the food location, and food to the juice bar. Its much bigger and has way more potential. The food side is packed with 2-3 customers standing to order food inside, but the juice side had room for tables, and was completely empty."}
{"text":"The food at this place looks really delish and colorful, but as I stood there waiting to order, I noticed one of the food servers had a deep gash on her hand that the flesh was not fully healed, it was not bandaged and she was handling some of the foods with her bare hands.  She also did not wash her hands between handling the food and cash.  So, I lost my appetite...and walked out."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed by that place. The shawarma (both chicken and beef) was pre-cut and they heated in the microwave! I ordered a chicken shawarm and it was so dry and didn't taste like much... most probably the worst shawarma I had.. ever!  One more thing that really got me uncomfortable is the weird smell in there, maybe because it's a small place, not sure... but definitely not the kind of smell you want at a restaurant."}
{"text":"*Review based solely on the shwarma*  good lawd, where do I even start...   My love of shwarma all started here, two years ago after a friend of mine would walk me to Bathurst, and more than half the time, insist on stopping in for a shwarma like a fiend with a secret addiction. He'd get all excited in a semi-bashful way similar to a teenaged boy going out for his first (legal) drink and not wanting to seem over-eager/excited. I didn't quite understand his hype...until one night I had one myself.   Pros: -veggies -always crisp and perfect, never stale; all my faves there so no complaints on my end   -Chicken- at the end of the night they scoop it out of a metal tray vs. off the spit a standard shwarma comes off of, but its still delicious. And if they take it directly off the spit, it's extra juicy delicious   -The garlic sauce is, is uh...*mouth waters* Delicious, to say the least   -Then it's toasted to deliciousness squared after they stick it in the sandwich press  -Portion sizes are more than good, and they don't cheap you out on the chicken, either (which I find lots of places do)   -Cheap, filling, fulfilling, and open late (like past 3am kinda late)   Cons:  -I don't own the place (but this might be a good thing)   Anyhow, don't judge the appearance of this small place, wonderful wonderful things are waiting to be had!! And y'know, you should have seen the annoyance on the face of the last person I was trying to drag here to achieve my shwarma fix..."}
{"text":"In the middle of everything from The Green Beanery, Starbucks, Second Cup, Aroma and other \"Caffeine Cafe's\" that stink like bathroom puck and over perfumed customers, Ghazi is a blessed oasis of fresh pressed juices that feed and nourish the body and the spirit!  The first few times I went I stayed safe getting a \"can go wrong\" pretty typical favourite, Banana and Strawberry with Apple Juice smoothy. It was delicious and refreshing! I was still going for a sweet treat and Ghazi gave me the option of having a healthy one! Their prices are comparable to other treaty beverages in the area, but with the health benefit of fresh and natural fruits and vegetables, it beats those other options hands down.  I hadn't really considered the real value of having a fresh juice bar available just around the corner, beyond guilt free smoothies, until I decided to start a detox cycle over some health issues. I found myself craving Beets and Celery and it came to mind that they would make a fantastic blood tonic juiced together. So the next chance I got I went over to Gazi and had them make me a wonderfully enlivening Beet, Celery & Lemon mixture. Having them hand me a cup full of rich magenta liquid filled with nutrition and well... joy.... made me smile, and it tasted great! Now I'm addicted to Beet and Celery juice! They have all sorts of options for healthy juice salads, and you can custom design your own!  The staff is generally kind and quick, informative and helpful! Though the space is quite small it's packed with fresh foods that they use for the juices, so you can pick your ingredients yourself and watch them make it for you. If you're in the area I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"After hours of sightseeing and picture taking at Casa Loma, we walked from Casa Loma to the Royal Museum of Ontario.  We were close to keeling over from hunger when we walked past this little store front and was harkened back by the aroma of foodie goodness.    Ghazale's offered 3 kinds of plates (the meat plate (I think that's the name), the slim plate (4 sides to include 1 meat), and the veggie plate (4 sides all veggies).  I had the veggie plate which allowed me to choose any of the 4 veggie or starch items they offered.  I chose 1.) stewed potatoes, carrots, and peas, 2.) lentil rice 3.) veggie balls 4.) cauliflower in a light tomato base gravy.  It was tasty and (with the exception of the veggie balls which are fried) I felt like it was healthy.    My son had the slim plate.  He chose the 1.) beef, 2.) tabouleh (which he LOVED), 3.) stewed potatoes, carrots, and peas 4.) lentil rice.    The servers wore gloves.    The door was opened and there was a fly or 2 in the establishment, but I didn't observe any on or near the food.    Ghazale's lost 2 stars because one of the servers was extremely sarcastic (rude) with a client who paid for a meal, left, and returned for his food.  In the interim another client came in, ordered the same item, was about to pay when the initial customer returned.  He kindly requested his food and she went into a theatrical performance questioning who he paid.  Other patrons explained to her he was there recently and paid.    Ghazale's lost another star because the food wasn't hot enough.    My son (12) says he wouldn't eat there again.  I might, but Ghazale's served its purpose for today."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting the Ghazale on College for roughly 2 years and i've felt they've let their standards drop and prices rise. So when I was biking on bloor one day I decided to try out this Ghazale. Best idea i've had in awhile.   -------------------------------  The Positive: The atmosphere is nice right away. There is energy between all the coworkers that translates to friendly greetings and warm service for the customers. The place is small, but clean. There is a good range of food and while i'm not sure, I suspect the location on college gets all their food from the ladies working here, because the food tastes significantly more fresh and you actually see people standing in the kitchen. While i'm not a vegetarian, I am often in the mood of a vegetable heavy meal at a low price and their combo plate hits that craving out of the park. There is nothing I wouldn't recommend, save for maybe their bland store bought pita bread. The ability to mix and match food items ensures it never gets boring going back. One of my favourite aspects is the amount of food you get for the price. A standard combo plate will cost around $10, but it's easily 2 meals for the average person (if you can stop yourself from eating the delicious food.)  -------------------------------  The Negative: The space is very small and there is really no comfortable way to sit there and eat. The best way to experience Ghazale is to get your food and find somewhere else to sit.   There is also a young employee, who is perhaps a trainee, but both times i've had him help me he was a total mess. He clumsily loaded my combo plate, he added 1/3 less than the other employees which left me feeling cheated. He asked me if I wanted tahini and then promptly put a TON of hot sauce on (which I did NOT want). He put my pita and on the press to warm it up but ended up tearing it to pieces when it got stuck on the top of the press. All the while he was bumping into others  and knocking things over. He never smiled, he felt out of place and just sours the atmosphere. We all have to start somewhere, but this kid needs way more supervision before being let loose on the customers.   -------------------------------  The Conclusion: Ghazale is a great restaurant for quick, cheap, delicious food. Go and try it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot as far as close to my culture food love the staff all of them friendly please dont tip as it goes to owner..thats the only issue i have with this store"}
{"text":"For some reason this Ghazale is the best one (out of all their locations) Although I wouldn't hesitate to visit any of their locations because the food is so good, soo cheap and the people who work it are always really nice.  This one on Bloor has a couple extras going for it. For starters they always load up their sandwiches with more stuff than the others. I usually get the grilled veggie pita, its filled with delicious fried eggplant and cauliflower that leaves me with cravings if I don't regularly get my fix. Also this one on Bloor also boasts a juice bar, oh and its open til also sorts of ungodly hours."}
{"text":"This is THE place to stuff your face before meeting up for some fun times on the Bloor St. strip around the U of T. Look around. You're right next door the Hot Docs Ted Rogers Cinema, and Lee's Palace is across the street so belly up to the hot table and have some nosh to complete your foundation for the evening, or drop in after the fun for late night snacking.  Plenty of typical middle eastern goodness here with all the toppings usually looking fresh and irresistible. The chicken rotisserie is in the window tempting you.  There is only room for 3 people along the wall with stools so grab one of those and keep an eye on the mirror to make sure you don't have tahini sauce on your face like I usually do."}
{"text":"Delicious food, lots of options, nice staff.  Great for late night.  Love having the option of a  Dinner Plate (this portions are huge) or the Slim plate (just perfect).  The chicken is juicy, tender and very tasty.  The rice options are a must, Samosas are really good, the potatoes, grilled zucchini, cauliflower, it is all very very good!  Love it here :)"}
{"text":"1 Star for being open when NOBODY else is open. 1 Star for not being pizza agaaaain  ...Umm... so... yea.  Ghazale.  I'm hoping that it translates into \"convenient\".  Super convenient they are.  Good food, they aren't.  Their falafal and shawarma exist in the $4 price range.  Trust me, you're getting exactly what you're paying for. A quickly warmed pita, microwaved almost-protein, and tasty toppings to mask the taste of Panosonic Nuke Waves.   They have lots of tasty juices, if you're hammered and need a lot of food, their combo plates will feed a starving family, and if you're not intensely disappointed with paying money for microwaved food... you'll likely be a lot more satisfied with Ghazale than I am.  ps - hit up Laila's across the street.  Better. :)    I mean, they really are convenient.  Falafal and Shawarma in the $4 range.  Open when NOBODY else remains open.  They really come through in the clutch.  Would I eat here if Laila's across the street was open?  Nope."}
{"text":"They make a very good portion of mini meal that included chicken rice, bean curry, chicken and fried garlic potatoes, zucchini and brinjal. They top them with different sauces and hummus(optional and of your choice). This complete box is too heavy for 1 and quite enough for two. Havent tried their falafels and shwarma which is in my next list. It was very yummy. The chicken is grilled well and the fried brinjal etc was good. They have optional potato or mixed vegetable curry as well. In rice they have saffron rice and lentil rice as options. I am a rice lover so prefer this one most of the times. However its the same everytime so if they come up with other curry and rice option will be even better. This is our favorite munching place for sure!"}
{"text":"like butter baby! got a potluck? need to fake like you spent hours over a hot stove? want healthy sides for the roast?  i highly recommend the butter beans and beet salad at Ghazales. the first is prepped to a consistency that is just... i know, yes, but yes, buttery. i mean, as opposed to over-cooked mushy beans. simply quarter-sized beans in a tomato sauce served hot or cold. the second, beet salad is tender, but barely. the toothsome texture is especially welcome in contrast to the butter beans and in comparison to the canned (but tasty) pickled beets most (not me) have grown to loathe. Seasoning for the beets was perfectly sour/sweet for my tastebuds.  I bought 500ml tubs, each for $4.99. There was plenty for sides for a group of 7 adults and 3 kids at a potluck with other dishes.   Ghazales has lots of other colourful items that I will surely be back to try. I like that most items look really healthy, it makes me feel good about picking up \"fast food\". While it's small, cramped, and really warm, especially when more than one other customer is in there, it's fine for take-out and the service is pretty quick."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for a while now and it's usually really good, always fresh, fast, and consistent. But I went here last night at 130 and to my surprise the chicken for chicken shawarma was precut!   Not sure why they would do that, instead sataying it to make it hot, juicy, and yummy, they just put it the pita and used a grill press.  The pita was nice and toasty but the chicken was still room temperature warm and dry, very dry. I would conclude that they do this only because they are lazy. I mean it gets pretty busy around 1 am and you won't have time to cut fresh meat each time and make the food good.  As for the ambiance, the place is very functional, no frills, you would go here only for fast convenient good food.  If you are hungry at night try to pass on this option but if you are in the area during the day, it's pretty fresh, good, and fast."}
{"text":"I was going to write a five star Ghalaze review on the basis of many, many previous visits. However, my cravings got the best of me and I went in for lunch today. I got my usual veggie wrap at the College Street location (which I have been unable to add as separate from the Bloor store). For the sake of an accurate review, it was good that I visited again because things have changed. I get the vibe that Ghazale is a family-run business but I wonder if they've had a restaurant management professional come in to \"improve\" their business practices...  When I ordered my veggie sandwich, a carefully pre-measured paucity of vegetables was placed inside. They used to load them up fat and free-hand, right? I'm sure they used to load them up free-hand.  The roasted vegetables for the sandwich were eggplant and potato. They used to include amazing seasoned cauliflower, right? I'm sure they used to have amazing seasoned cauliflower.  Time to pay: the cost of the veggie sandwich was $3.75 plus tax. It used to be $2.75 plus tax, right? I'm sure it used to be $2.75  The end result was a sandwich that was smaller, less tasty and more expensive than I was used to. It was still fairly good, but I was expecting better. I'm sure later Yelp postings for Ghazale will tear me apart for this mediocre review but I can only report on my own experiences.  Ghalaze has shwarma, lentil soup and samosas, too. There are trays of baklava on the counter which I've found to be somewhat stale.  PS: I'm an archaeologist and geek, so whenever I walk past Ghazale on either Bloor or College Street, I start thinking about the Jordanian Neolithic site 'Ain Ghazal. Here's a link, because I care about your education: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Ain_Ghazal"}
{"text":"This place has great chicken shwarma wrap. Its quick and easy food. Sometimes too hectic for me to stand in line since its a smaller place, better for take out."}
{"text":"Most fantastic Meal  for a large crowd.  Everyone raved about the quality and quantity.  Great flavours and wonderful delivery service. We will definitely order again from these great people"}
{"text":"Wow, I'm surprised by all the negative ratings.  I love it here!  Where else can you spend $5 and select from a whole whack of veggie offerings.  They have about 10 different dishes to choose from and they are all great.  Tabouli, cabbage salad, bulgar with toasted almonds, grilled eggplant, roast potatoes, spicy lima beans, roasted beets, etc.  The list goes on.  Each dish is very well made with great seasoning and careful cooking.  None of the dishes are \"fillers\" like the plain rice that most take out places use.  Service is fast and friendly.  Many other reviewers have complained about the shwarmas.   I have been avoiding shwarmas for years because they always look like mystery meats.  Looking at the other dishes, it was clear to me that this is a place that puts a lot of care in their cooking.  So, I felt okay about having a shwarma here.  Ghazale's chicken shwamra looks and tastes like chicken!  Mine didn't come straight off the spit, but I didn't find it dry at all.  More importantly, I didn't find it greasy or made from mystery meats.  I'm guessing that the negative reviews are mostly from people that see a shwarma and have some expectations about getting a fix of guilty pleasure that Ghazale's doesn't satisfy.  Instead the food here is healthful, lovingly made and a great deal.  I plan to eat here whenever I'm in the Annex and looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"So about a decade ago, I was hanging out with an artist (read: broke) friend of mine and I had just treated him to a few pints at the Green Room with some cash from my pocket. But by the end of the night, it was late and we were starving.   So we headed to the Pizza Pizza on 1 Albany Ave. -which incidentally is now a Star Bucks, to get two pepperoni slices. My friend, broke as always looked at me and looked at him '...Fine,' I said. So I reach into my pocket and lo and behold, I had forgotten my wallet, no cards with me either, all I had was about $25 and most of that had gone into the beers at the Green Room.   Yay!  So we start searching in our bags and pockets for loose change and by the end we managed to scrape about $2.35 between the two of us. So I told the Pizza Pizza guy if we could have a Pepperoni slice for our change. He did not looked very receptive at our request. I remember, he was an older, mature and moustached gentlemen. He looked at our situation, our puppy-eyed, starving faces and gently reassured us,  \"Get out of here.\" So we left.   We walked west towards Bathurst and when we saw Ghazale we decided to give it a try, so in we go with our $2.35 and made our plead.   Now, I do not know if anyone remembers, back in the day one, one of the men who worked there, was a bald gentleman, black hair on the sides, a beard and  what I thought to be a lazy eye. For real!   He crazy man look always bothered me a bit (at first) but anyway, it was him who talked to us and said:  'Sure, I'll give you two falafel sandwiches but you have to promise me, when you are in the neighbourhood you always have to come here.' We were starving, so we agreed. He took our money and gave us two falafel sandwishes! One each! Score! Now, I do not know if my friend kept his promise... But I did.  For 7 years.  Every time while in the hood, I always got a chicken Shawarmas and they were delicious. They use to add tons of tasty humus and tahina, Tsatsiki, maybe some baba ghanoush and I always asked to add a touch of hot sauce, oh, I loved them. Including the sauce that dripped at the bottom of the wrapper, yes, I did that. I am sure some of you did it too!   But over time, I stopped seeing the one eyed man anymore and all of the sudden I began to only see women working there. Which lead me to believe that maybe management had changed.   Back then a Chicken shawarma was really filling and was about $3.20. Today, the sandwiches are smaller, with less chicken but cost $5.00+tax! Heck, at one point they charged you extra for a touch of Baba ghanoush, or tahina which I thought was a cheap move on their part taking into consideration how many they sold. No Tsatsiki any more either and if you ask for it, they give you a weird look. Give me a break! (Although in fairness it sometimes depends who is behind the counter)  After the renovations a few years ago, the place turned more into a fast food, order, pick up and leave joint. As before you could hang out with some of the people who worked there and socialize with patrons as they had a few chairs for people to sit inside and outside. Now it is all, \"order the food, thank you, good bye.\" The women are not very friendly or chatty except for maybe the one who is taking your cash.   Sure, the place has always had a pretty low-rent vibe but with the reno a few years back the place still looks low-rent but now, it is flashy low-rent! Come on, you are not fooling anyone.         In the end, I  gave the place plenty of business over the years as I brought many friends here and would like to think that I did fulfill my side of the bargain I made so many years ago. However, if you are going for fast food, at $5.00+tax for a shrinking (and at times dry) chicken sandwich it is simply not worth it anymore when you can go across street to one of the many Sushi or Korean places, get a place to sit, and more of a selection for $7.00.  Too bad Ghazele"}
{"text":"The problem with this place is that it smells MUCH better than it actually tastes.  It's like those damn hot dog carts that suck you in with the delicious fried onions and then halfway through the hot dog your over it.  And I must say taht this place has NEVER failed at smell.  My mouth seriously starts to water everytime I walk past this place- it's so dangerous to decide to go to the theatre or Aroma (the two commercial spots that neighbour this place).  But I find the food very average.  It ain't bad, but I have definitely tasted better. I maybe would have even rated this place higher if the place DIDN'T smell so good from the outside just cuz the amazing smell just ends up in a let down post-shawarma"}
{"text":"This is my favourite late night snack place, hands-down.  The staff is SOOOO nice, the options are endless, the food is SO good. The price is right. They get it to you quickly. The juice bar next door is pretty good, too."}
{"text":"I got their meat platter since I was assuming it's like a full meal with rice and sides but when I got back home and opened the box, it was actually only just the sides. The service was also not the best. The lady in charge doesn't listen to instructions well--I was asking for more tomatoes but received eggplants instead. If you're in desperate need for food at night, this would be fine but if you've got time, go somewhere else for food."}
{"text":"Ever wanted to see a rainbow inside of a fast food restaurant? Well, if you step inside Ghazale, your eyes can feast on the mounds and mounds of vegetables and their bright colours.  Heaped into dozens of metallic containers, you will find every vegetable and topping imaginable in this tiny location on Bloor, a perfect spot for a late night munchies run, or a snack after a night out!   I've had many a falafel at 2 am at Ghazale, but there are also a number of other dishes and tasty treats for a good price as well. Just thinking about that aroma; that warm and scrumptious smell that sweeps across you as you walk down Bloor, is making my mouth water!     I've heard a lot of people disappointed with Ghazale for its price and mediocre spread, but I have never experienced this. Maybe I've just been lucky in my fare, but Ghazale is one of my old time faves in a quick snack grab...A great place for yummy and nutritious food at any time of day; fast food that is actually healthy! You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Well, I hate to say it but people always say that horrible experiences spread faster than positive ones. Today I write my first review....and sadly it isn't about a pleasant experience.   First off, I need to say that I love my middle eastern wraps, and I've tried quite a few places and had some really amazing wraps. The food here seemed to be on par with most places I'd eaten at. However partway through my meal I found a fingernail in my wrap. I'd already eaten half the wrap and picked it up to go. I did t know what it was at first but after spitting it out and inspecting it closer it was a cleanly clipped fingernail.  So, besides the fact that that was the most disgusting thing I've ever found in my food and that I wanted to punch the person making this in the face, my wife had to calm me down so I wouldn't go back into that filthy place and make a scene.   So, to summarize:   - why are their staff clipping their fingernails in the restaurant and close enough vicinity of their food - why would you do this you filthy fucks? - never going back to this place again - FINGERNAIL clipping in your shawarma, need I say more? FFS...."}
{"text":"I for a chicken shawarma here. Chicken was a little bit dry, but overall the sandwich was OK."}
{"text":"Worst chicken shawarma I've had. The chicken they used was not off the rotisserie, it was this old, crusty, dried up chicken that was pre-cut. The lady did not use gloves to prepare my food, and used the microwave to warm it up.  Also, the lady who took my money was also handling food at the same time.   Price wasn't that cheap either. For only the small chicken shawarma, I paid almost $6.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"I always leave a happy girl when I get the falafel wrap here. The messiness of this meal is well worth it. They also have a great selection of middle eastern salads if you prefer a meat and salad platter. When I'm in the mood for a chicken shawarma I'll be coming here."}
{"text":"delicious.  not going to lie its fabulous hangover food.  carb galore.  lol.  the food is excellent i love it the fried eggplant califlower, zuchini.  i mean what take out place can u actually get that!  the place feels homey primarily because there are these beautiful somalian/ethipian looking women cooking and doing their thing!  my only suggestion would be that its a tad greasy and could be less mushy.  but overall i supoose thats a part of the charm!"}
{"text":"So the first time, they messed up our order, instead of beef Somosas, they gave us vegetables Somosas. Second time, they gave us two less Somosas. This place is terrible! Third time, again, messing up orders. They're always messing up orders and not paying any attention!!!"}
{"text":"The down side of the place... They use a freaking micro wave to reheat your meal. Limited buffet selection of foods to eat.  The positives: Its not all that expensive, and during a weak where i felt i didn't have enough vegi's, for $10 you can buy a platter... which you can take home 3 vegi dishes + a protien and re-invigorate yourself.  Tip... if you decide to buy the chicken shwarma, (if there isn't a line) you can request that they carve the chicken fresh from the rotisserie."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to's for tasty vegetarian food in the gta.  We often go specifically down to bloor from Yonge and Eg to pick up their food and bring home.  Consistently delicious and very well priced.  We are very happy with the taste of the food and with the cheerful staff that serves it."}
{"text":"I was recently informed that Ghazale does in fact roast their meat on a spit, they just place it in a container afterwards. I apologize for completely missing the spit (in the window) and jumping to conclusions. Although I still feel the same way about the food."}
{"text":"Really like the large beans they serve, but they're frequently out of them!"}
{"text":"Was walking down Bloor St after a yoga class dreaming of a healthy snack (extending the benefits of one healthy activity by following with another before I get into burgers and beer later to balance it off) and boom - nice surprise - a new joint by Ghazale, this time fresh-squeezed juice and smoothies. I had an orange juice, banana and blueberry smoothie, all freshly made in front of your eyes with a ripe banana (nice bonus as most places have them green).  Fantastic healthy treat for a moderate price. I only wish they had larger size cup, their largest is too small by my standards. Nice addition to the Annex for sure."}
{"text":"Wow! For the price this place is outstanding. I've been coming here since I first moved to Toronto looking for any excuse to drop in when I'm within a 5km radius. I fell in love with their stuffed grape leaves, tabouli and pretty much any of their bean salads. It's better for takeout as seating is quite limited but if you can grab a seat it's neat to eat and watch the interesting and diverse customer pool that drop in."}
{"text":"this is like a little david copperfield (or if you prefer penn & teller) outfit.  they line their corridor with containers and containers of beautifully coloured food, fresh looking, piled really high like a freshly packed grave.  but like a magic show, its all an illusion of the highest order.  the litmus test at a place like this should be the falafel or the shawarma.  i had meat earlier in the day so i decided to get the combo plate at 7.99.  i had falafel (3 balls), a chick pea salad with onions, tomatoes, etc., beet salad and fried eggplant.  you were allowed four items for the combo, which came in a plastic container about the size of a harlequin romance book.  to my dismay...it kind of killed the meal for me from the start...he asked me if i wanted it warmed up.  everything was cold.  brutal.  only because it meant that it had to be warmed up IN THE MICROWAVE.    microwaves kill the goodness in everything.  ESPECIALLY FALAFEL.  as i expected the falafels were crap.  they were about as tender as a bite of plastacene.  i thank them only for the lesson never to get a falafel thats not made for me on the spot.    the rest of the vegetable salads (they only warmed up the falafel and the eggplant) were mediocre.  the beets were fresh, as were the other veggies but bland.  fried eggplant, middle eastern style, at its best can be a rich experience of melt-in-your-mouth delicacy.  this one was a resoundingly boring one.  i dont think it is too much to ask to have the option of either warming stuff up in an oven or making it fresh (the falafel at least).  the fact that this food can be made quickly doesnt mean that it should suffer the embarrassment of cursory attention to vitality of taste and texture.  go to laila across the street...the cost is comparable and the food is ten times better.  http://www.yelp.ca/biz/laila-toronto"}
{"text":"This is a great take-out place and, occasionally, one can dine in, too, using their neighboring juice store.  I love their chicken liver in a pita with a lentil soup.  Their warm lima bean salad is protein heaven.  You will be pleased with the amount of chicken and veggies stuffed into a typical shawarma.  The world would be a better place if \"Ghazale hu akbar\" was shouted instead."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a large quantity of quality vegetarian food for not much money. I've been going here for years."}
{"text":"I find myself hitting this spot often because it's usually always on the way home regardless where I have been that evening... It's always a good option when I am broke and only have a couple of toonies in my wallet. Only problem is that the prices seem to have increased considerably since I started going here. A chicken schwarma is not quite as reasonable as it used to be and I think even a falafel is around the $4 range.   Still, I keep coming back. Their late-night hours make it hard not to pop in for a quick bite. Place is incredibly small and can get a little hectic when packed with hungry drunk people. I do like the little button you have to push to enter and exit the store though."}
{"text":"I ended up stopping into Ghazale (which should definitely not have the word Restaurant after it) on Sunday night before my drive back to Buffalo. I've probably passed this place a couple of thousand times in the past and never looked twice but thanks to it being open and appearing fast I figured it was the best time to stroll in. The place itself is very small, but does exactly what it needs to do. The options are pretty much right in front of you so you can see what you will be getting. I ended up ordering a chicken Sharma wrap along with a single Iija and a single falafal ball on the side. What was wrong you ask? Well, We were the only people in the store and they totally didn't give me the Iija or the falafal ball which were 2 things I really, really wanted to eat. The wrap itself was good, I can't take that away from them. The chicken had good flavour and the wrap was solidly built.  Overall, I have mixed feelings about Ghazale. The wrap was good and filled me up, but forgetting not 1, but 2 of the things I ordered kind of ruins the experience when it's not even busy. If you are in need of a wrap, this will definitely cure that but I can't see myself returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"A shawarma with re-heated chicken and a falafel sandwich with re-heated falafel.  In my books, this is sacrilege (of the non-sacrilicious variety).    No self-respecting falafalist should be seen here!"}
{"text":"This is my partner's favourite fast food joint - which makes sense as they serve lots of different veggie dishes and they are open late.  She jokingly says she steered me towards find a temporary apartment in the Annex just so she can eat here.  Overall, the veggie dishes they serve are delicious and cheap.  Seriously - $3 for a big cup of tasty root veggies is damn satisfying.  The shawarma on the other hand?  Meh.  It kinda sucks to be honest.  Which might explain the low ratings.  So in short - if you are into veggie dishes, this is pretty damned good joint for cheap.  You can find better shawarma elsewhere.  As an omnivore?  I give it 3-stars."}
{"text":"Great value and taste for the money! They're open late and I often eat here when I'm downtown usually at the Bloor or College location. The food is quite hot and fresh. Love their vine leaves, kebab and tabbouleh salad but it's all good. Eggplant is another favourite. There's limited seating but usually there's seating available as most get take-out. So many good choices to and mostly healthy vegetarian options."}
{"text":"After walking back and forth past this place for eight years and never going in, I decided to give it a try yesterday. I'm very glad that I did! First and foremost, you are going to get great value here. We got 2 veggie plates ($7 each) and 1 meat plate ($8). You get to choose 4 items (meat plate includes one meat) from a wide variety of fresh and flavourful options, and the portions and generous. Our favorites were the lima beans, mosaga, beet salad, tabouli, and the beef kebabs. I'm glad to have finally ventured into this place and am looking forward to trying their juice place next door."}
{"text":"Very tasty. I find food at Ghazale a bit more flavourful  than Ali Babas. It wee bit more expensive, but still cheap enough."}
{"text":"Fantastic food !  Plates are huge and you can choose from any combination of them.  They have a large selection of vegetarian dishes, and many meats also. They have unusual options such as lentils with rice and couscous.  The only downside I see is that it is only take-out.  When the weather is good you can use some patio tables and chairs on the outside. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Are you effing kidding me? 3 stars? WTF?  I just ate the worst shawarma i've ever had in my life at this place. Worst ever. PERIOD.  I walk in there, thinking i'll try a new place and next thing i know the woman behind the counter is stuffing an old ripped up sack of an excuse for pita bread with some old dry chicken meat. She then proceeded to toss it in one of an army of microwaves. Apparently temperature means freshness here. Never go here. There are a plethora of awful and dreadful places to eat for cheap or cheaper. better yet, why not actually go to a good place? Sarah & laila (in the area) don't really float my boat anymore but i'll take them anytime over this. I'de eat dirt before i'de eat this again.  Next time I walk into a place and order something and they have the audacity to microwave it in front of my face, I'll simply turn around and walk straight out the door. I won't even say anything. Let the next poor schmuck get that twice microwaved shit!"}
{"text":"Largely depends on who makes your sandwich, you might just get a bunch of lettuce and onion. Also they put way too much sauce and its easy to make a mess, more so if you get a plate. I realize they'er just trying to hook you up but maybe they should just consider bigger containers if that's the case."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would.   The food is bland but deserves 1 star for having some decent vegetarian options. They lose that star by blatantly loathing their customers. I have never been treated so badly in my life. Twice I have visited and twice I have been abused or yelled at. I have never been so disgusted in a business and will never come back."}
{"text":"Ghazale is not bad but I've had better. No frills lebanese fast food joint, always busy, so the food tends to be fresh. Their shwarmas are loaded and very filling, but there is something missing: maybe it's the pita, maybe it's the meat, maybe it's just nostalgia for Boustan and Al-Taib from my Montreal days. The 514 cheap mid-eastern eats are so much better than what you get in the 416. And the Ghazale location on Bloor West is one of the better ones. Le sigh."}
{"text":"It was late at night and my partner and I were coming back from a show at the Super Wonder Gallery which was conveniently beside the Ghazale Restaurant. I must say it was delicious. If you are hungry... this will cure you. Especially if you had a couple drinks and want something quickly. It was a fast paced environment and you didn't have to wait too long until you received your food. The staff were nice and the food looked so good you will probably want to buy something else impulsively. At least that is what I wanted to do. It's a \"Run and Go\" eatery and I wouldn't expect to be sitting there long since there is a lot of traffic in and out of the restaurant. It is rather loud, considering the traffic outside and all of the people talking in a small and tight space but what else do you expect at 1:00AM in the morning, you can tell this place has been a lot of peoples \"Go To\" Late night eatery.  I would go there again and again. Make sure to get extra hot sauce.  I had the falafel by the way... try that!"}
{"text":"The WORST chicken shawarma I have ever had. Even food court shawarma is better. So cramped as well. I know it is a takeout place mostly. I will never come here again. I have no idea what the hype is. Give me Ali Baba over this place anyday."}
{"text":"I DIG IT! Ghazale is another of my top cheap eats.  I pick up a Ghazale \"combination plate\" once in awhile on my way home. The combination plate is a selection of 1 meat and 3 non-meat dishes (or 4 non meat options if you're a veg) and it comes with a pita on the side.  Such a good deal, at $6.99 you can't go wrong. It's so much food that I can take the leftovers for lunch the next day.  My favourite dishes (I think I've tried them all!):  \"Mosaga\" which is a roasted eggplant dish with chickpeas and peppers, looks a bit like ratatouille but SO flavourful. Yum.  Cabbage salad - self explanatory, very tasty.  Their bulgor and tabouli salad are both pretty bad ass.  Falafel is awesome and the roasted cauliflower dish are so yummy. Both the fatoush and beet salads are lovely too.  It sucks there is no place to sit, but it's still so worth it if you live nearby. Buy food, go home, eat in front of tv :)"}
{"text":"The rice here is amazing. I ordered a meal plate with the yellow rice and chicken with tahini and garlic sauce. both sauces were good. I had to order more rice-a regular serving for $3.99 plus tax. Also, I didn't feel sick or gassy afterwards like some places around the same price. Very satisfied."}
{"text":"Terrible food and ridiculously overpriced. I got a combo (shawarma+a tiny salad+coke) for close to $12+tax, and another 'regular' salad and my total came to $20,50.  The shawarma came cold (I was distracted and couldn't see that they didn't put it in the toaster) and didn't taste good overall, and their 'taboule' salad consisted of parsley, parsley, more parsley and a couple of tiny pieces of tomato and onions. I struggled to eat it for 30 minutes because the stems of the parsley were so thick it was impossible to eat. What a rip-off and shitty food. Wish I'd just crossed the street and gone to Ali Baba."}
{"text":"While looking around for new place that served decent eggplant/veggie sandwiches decided to try Ghazale and although a teeny hole in the wall  on Bloor Street squeezed between a burger place and the new Hot Docs theatre. I was impressed. While everything is always bigger and fuller than it needs to be you do get value for your dollar (maybe too much?) The eggplant is always delicious and there are no extra charges for changes. The only quibble is the wraps are so overstuffed they are often not rolled properly so things can leak."}
{"text":"The food is yummy, but pay attention to the cleanliness here! A few years back they cleaned the vents and washed them in the sink with vegetables in it. I didn't go back for a few years. Then last week I thought hey I will give it another shot....the lady who served me took out the garbage, then used her phone, served someone else, and gave them their change- then made a dressing. She didn't wash her hands the whole time! Will not ever be going back! So not worth a cheap meal."}
