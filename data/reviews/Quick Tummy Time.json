{"text":"Amazing Falafel. Was working late and starving, luckily this little gem was still open and on my way home. Was expecting the late hour would cause the food to be less fresh than during the day, but I was happily mistaken; the falafel was spooned and fried right before my eyes and the veggies super crisp. Service was super friendly (once again a surprise for the late hour) and the finished product was one of the best falafel sandwiches I've had in a while! Be sure to check out this tasty joint for good grub any time!"}
{"text":"$5 chicken shwarma tax incl. need i say more

this is becoming my late night go-to shwarma place. at 2-3am, very satisfying meal. 

the guy who owns the place is super nice, jokes around about putting extra hot sauce on your shwarma (he wont tho, unless you want it)

pertinent details: ingredients are fresh, serving size is generous, flavour combo rocks.

mm..i want a shwarma now..."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place doesn't have a page on Yelp since it's so busy.

Look.. this probably isn't the BEST Shwarma place in Toronto. But I've been to quite a few and I always love this place, especially during lunch.

I have to admit I always get the same thing, the Chicken Shwarma Plate, there's a lunch special from 11:00am-3:00pm every day, so it's cheap and filling and tastes great.

Comes with a variety of salads/veggies, some really nice, fluffy flavored rice, a spoonful of garlic sauce (i usually say no to that tho), a spoonful of Hummus, and of course the chicken shwarma. Oh and they add a nice wedge potato on top too.

The \"hot sauce\" they put on isn't hot AT ALL but it is super tasty and I always ask for extra.

If you're in the neighbourhood at lunch, check it out. It's pretty busy between 11:30 - 12:30 but they are pretty quick for the most part.

They also have a free Punch Card where after every 10th plate you get a free one. 

Cheap + good. 

Also I have a pretty sensitive stomach and I've never felt ill eating here. That's saying something, trust me."}
{"text":"I stumbled in here on a Thursday night after a TIFF flick to kill the gnawing in my belly.  Almost did too good a job.  I guess I've been spoiled, but the shawarma was uninspired at best, moist and unpalatable at worst.  If you feel like grabbing a bite here, keep on walking."}
{"text":"Came back here today as I was in the area for work. This place is a solid 3-star joint, good food, decent portions and fast service. However, I feel like the portions have gone down and I'm still paying the same price. I ended up getting the mixed shwarma plate this time (7.99) and a drink, to bring my total up to about $10.16. I realized afterwards that I'd screwed myself out of the lunch deal but whatever.

They gave me a small takeout container which was piled pretty full, but I still feel like you get more food if you eat in. Be sure to get all the sauces, they're what makes this shwarma pretty good. The mixed shwarma was pretty good - could I tell what was what? No way. It was nice to have a little variation in the flavor though, but I think the chicken shwarma here is where its at. The rice was a tad off, left most of that in the container, but just about everything else was good. A little too much strong (not cooked enough) onion, it's all I can taste right now. And the parsley in their couscous or whatever it was way too big and annoying to eat.

All in, its a good stop on the shwarma train but I think I can get shwarma that's just as good closer to my current office. However, I'll be closer at my new job so I anticipate trying out a bunch of their other dishes and seeing how they stack up."}
{"text":"Not the best shwarma around but it is very cheap. You get what you paid for on this one. The staff is friendly and they make you feel like a small family but I honestly think the food gave my an upset stomach afterwards and I don't go down easy."}
